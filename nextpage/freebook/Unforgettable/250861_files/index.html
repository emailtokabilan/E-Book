<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">April—New	York</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	Collins	paced	the	floor	of	his	small	apartment	in	New	York	City,	his	eyes drawn	repeatedly	to	the	pile	of	papers	on	his	desk.	Two	hundred	sheets,	stacked neat	and	square,	title	page	on	top. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stepping	closer,	he	loomed	over	his	work.	Not	the	usual	fare	for	a	playwright, this	novel--but	it	was	finally	complete.	Finished.	His	fist	came	down	hard	on	the manuscript.	Finished?	Then	where	was	the	satisfaction	he	longed	for?	Where was	the	closure?	He	stroked	the	top	page	in	atonement	and	smiled	ruefully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Closure?	Not	with	that	title:</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">STRAIGHT	FROM	THE	HEART…</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">…a	love	story	in	search	of	an	ending…</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">He	and	Jen.	How	could	the	story’s	inspiration	be	anyone	else? </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Jennifer	Grace	Delaney. </i>	She	was	either	his	inspiration	or	his	albatross.	While students	together	at	Boston	University,	she’d	been	the	quiet	girl	in	the	back	of the	English	class	who’d	captured	his	heart	with	her	first	essay--writing	filled with	pain,	strength,	and	wrapped	in	love.	Goosebumps	had	covered	his	skin	as he’d	read	her	words	aloud	to	the	class	in	a	random	exchange	of	student	essays. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	covered	him	now,	as	he	recalled	their	honesty.	But	she’d	hated	that	class. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Said	personal	stories	belonged	in	a	private	diary,	not	exposed	to	a	bunch	of strangers.	She’d	stick	to	numbers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’d	loved	him,	too.	Believed	in	him.	They’d	planned	a	future…at	least	he’d thought	they	had…but	in	the	end,	she	wouldn’t	leave	her	siblings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	breath	jerked	at	the	memory.	They	could	have	had	the	perfect	life:	Wall</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>Street	for	Jen;	Broadway	for	him.	Or	rather	off-off	Broadway	back	then.	Serious theater.	He’d	lined	up	a	bartending	job	at	night,	too.	He’d	thought	Jen	was onboard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	on	the	day	after	graduation,	she’d	met	him	in	Boston	Common	with shadowed	eyes	and	a	forced	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	wrong,	Henny-Penny?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Avoiding	his	gaze,	she’d	said,	“I’m	not	good	at	beating	around	the	bush,	so	I’ll just	come	out	with	it.”	She’d	finally	looked	at	him.	“I’ve	taken	the	position	with Fidelity	here	in	Boston.	I	can’t	leave	my	family.	I	can’t	move	to	New	York.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stared,	frozen.	“How	could	you	make	such	an	important	decision	without discussing	it	first—with	me?	We’re	the	two	that	count	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,”	she	said	softly,	“but	I	couldn’t	take	the	chance	that	you’d	change	my mind.	I’m	so	torn	inside.	I	want	to	go,	but	I	just	can’t	leave	Lisa	to	manage everything.	The	boys	are	a	teenage	handful	and	Emily…well,	you	know	sweet Em.	Still	not	the	most	confident	kid	on	the	block.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	generous	heart.	He	loved	her	for	it,	but…	“Sometimes,	Jen,	loyalty	can	go too	far.	Your	big	sister’s	not	alone.	There	are	two	adults	in	that	house.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	mouth	wobbled,	and	she	reached	for	his	hand.	“Technically,	yes.	But	Mike and	Lisa…?	I	don’t	know.	Something’s	not	right	between	them.	I	can	feel	it.	I’m uneasy.	They	leave	notes	for	each	other	and	don’t	talk.	Mike	comes	home	late often,	and	I	think	he’s	out	with	his	team,	hitting	some	clubs.	He	never	used	to	do that.	He	and	Lisa…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	paused,	and	he	saw	her	gasp	for	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“…seem	to	be	living	two	separate	lives	in	one	house.	I	don’t	know	what’s happened	or	what’s	going	to	happen,	and	I-I	just	can’t	leave	my	brothers	and sisters	now.	They’re	too	young.	They	need	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence	pulsed	against	his	ears.	“Have	you	spoken	with	Lisa	directly?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t,”	she	whispered.	“Lisa’s	so	private.	She	thinks	she’s	protecting	us.	And really,	their	marriage	isn’t	my	business.	Mike’s	been	very	good	to	me.	To	all	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>us.”	She	shrugged.	“It’s	just…he’s	gone	so	often	during	the	season,	and	now	he’s gone	at	night	in	the	off-season.	All	I	know	is	that	Lisa’s	got	too	much	on	her plate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	marriages	have	tough	times.	They’ll	work	it	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	so,”	she	admitted,	“but	I	know	what	I	see	and	feel.	Threads	are	fraying--</p>
<p class="calibre1">again.	She	rose	from	their	bench	and	gazed	into	the	distance.	“The	timing	is wrong	for	us.	But	maybe	we	can	find	some	weekends	to	visit.	It’s	a	short	flight, right?”	She	faced	him	again,	her	eyes	welling.	“Maybe	when	the	kids	are	older, I’d	feel	better	about	leaving	them.	Please,	Doug,	please	don’t	argue	with	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Damn!	Was	she	just	going	to	fold	like	that?	She	was	twenty-two	now,	a	college graduate.	An	adult. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	us,	Jen?	An	occasional	weekend	is	not	a	real	life!	You’re	entitled	to your	freedom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	chin	had	come	up,	the	threat	of	tears	gone,	her	violet	eyes	now	almost sizzling	black.	“Am	I	really?	After	everything	she’s	given	up	for	us--me	and	the little	ones?	I-I	can’t	leave	her	to	cope	alone.	I’m	the	next	oldest.	I	love	them,	and I…owe	them!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	blood	ran	hot,	but	his	stomach	knotted	in	cold	fear.	If	he	was	going	to	lose this	argument,	he	wouldn’t	go	down	easy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can’t	leave	them	or	won’t?	Tell	me,	Jen,	for	how	many	years	does	the	accident reverberate?	For	how	many	years	is	it	allowed	to	control	you?	You’re	the	math genius,	so	what’s	the	answer?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	froze	for	a	moment,	then	cupped	his	cheek.	“You	already	know	the	answer,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	whispered.	“Deep	inside…that	place	where	truth	lives.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	flinched	now	as	he	recalled	her	words.	His	words.	He’d	used	them	on	her after	reading	that	essay,	the	one	that	had	blown	him	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	the	tears	ran	down	her	cheek	as	she	spoke.	“I’m	so	sorry,	Doug.	I’m	sorry for	us	both.	But	my	family	has	to	come	first.	The	Delaney	siblings	either	stick together	or	fall.	That’s	what	I’ve	learned.	If	we’d	been	separated	back	then,	after the	accident…well,	we	wouldn’t	have	survived,	not	as	a	family.”	She	kissed	him</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>quickly.	“It	won’t	be	forever.	Maybe	one	day,	you’ll	be	able	to	write	again	in Boston.	We’ll	talk	on	the	phone.	We’ll	visit	on	weekends.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	knew	she	was	grasping	for	a	thread	of	salvation,	but	he	was,	too.	“I	love	you, Jen.	Don’t	disappear	on	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	she’d	kissed	him	and	run	off,	leaving	him	to	stare	in	disbelief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	rubbed	his	damp	forehead	as	the	image	of	a	racing	Jennifer,	long	hair	flying, remained	in	his	mind’s	eye.	The	emotions	remained,	too.	Love,	disappointment, anger,	frustration—he’d	wanted	to	smash	something.	Writing	a	scene,	he’d discovered,	was	a	hell	of	a	lot	easier	than	living	through	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Patting	the	manuscript	on	his	desk,	he	collapsed	into	the	chair	in	front	of	the computer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	called	Jen	every	Sunday	in	the	beginning.	She	flew	down	once,	met	a couple	of	his	friends--other	writers.	He’d	hoped	to	change	her	mind,	convince her	to	take	a	chance	in	the	Big	Apple.	“You	could	have	stayed	in	Boston,”	she’d countered.	But	that	wasn’t	true.	Not	with	his	hard-won	residency	with Playwrights’	House—an	opportunity	of	a	lifetime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	visits	became	fewer,	the	phone	calls	less	frequent.	Busy	careers.	Busier lives.	Both	trying	to	make	their	marks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	dammit!	Five	years	in	limbo	was	long	enough! </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	tapped	the	keyboard	and	composed	an	email	to	his	friend,	editor	Steven Kantor.	The	man	was	doing	him	a	favor	by	reading	a	manuscript	not	for publication.	Steve	wouldn’t	earn	a	dime,	even	if	he	loved	it.	But	maybe	that’s what	goosed	the	editor’s	curiosity.	He	knew	Doug’s	plays—his	emergence	as	a serious	playwright—heck,	the	guys	had	been	friends	for	five	years,	hitting	New York	at	about	the	same	time,	both	craving	success	and	working	non-stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	wrote	it,”	Steve	had	said,	“it	won’t	be	a	time-waster.	Just	send	it	when you’re	ready.	Maybe	I’ll	learn	something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	compliment	like	that	couldn’t	be	bought.	Doug	gifted	him	with	tickets	to	any Broadway	show	he	wanted. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>He	skimmed	the	manuscript	pages	one	more	time.	Then,	attaching	the	electronic file	to	his	email,	he	took	a	deep	breath	and	hit	Send. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	time	to	let	Jen	go.	Or	find	her	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">One	month	later—Boston</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">On	a	late	Friday	afternoon	in	May,	Jennifer	Delaney	hung	up	the	phone—</p>
<p class="calibre1">hopefully	the	last	call	of	the	day—and	walked	to	her	office	window,	amazed,	as always,	at	how	lucky	she’d	been.	A	wonderful	career,	great	friends…not	to mention	the	stunning	view	of	Boston	Harbor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	huge	investment	firm	where	she	worked	suited	her	to	a	T.	Helping	to manage	funds	and	advising	clients	about	risk	soothed	their	money	worries	as well	as	her	own.	Sighing,	she	acknowledged	how	ridiculous	that	seemed	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	checkbook,	her	personal	investments	were	sound.	She	wondered	why childhood	scars	were	so	hard	to	heal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Losing	loving	parents	at	sixteen…unspeakable	pain.	But	she’d	survived.	Her older	sister	and	brother-in-law	thought	she’d	thrived.	Her	younger	siblings thought	she	was	cool.	Maybe	she	was!	Regardless,	they’d	had	each	other’s	backs from	the	beginning	of	those	rough	days	and	always	would.	She	couldn’t	imagine her	life	without	them.	Her	life	was	good.	Calm.	Balanced.	Like	her	checkbook. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	the	way	I	want	it	to	be,”	she	murmured. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	phone	rang	again.	Shaking	her	head,	she	raced	back	to	her	desk.	“Jennifer Delaney	speaking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	are	you,	Henny-Penny?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	voice.	The	receiver	slipped	from	her	hand	and	hit	the	floor.	That	warm voice.	That	nickname.	Once	upon	a	time…</p>
<p class="calibre1">Retrieving	the	phone,	she	said,	“I’m	well.	Doing	very	well,	thanks.	It’s	been	a long	time…so,	how’s	New	York?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“New	York	was	humming	along	the	last	I	saw	it.	And	that’s	the	thing,	Jen.	I’m back	in	Boston	now,	and	I’d	love	to	see	you.	Any	chance	you’re	free	tonight? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>The	workday’s	almost	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back	in	Boston?	Like	forever	or	just	a	quick	visit?	Their	parting	might	have been	her	decision	years	ago,	but	the	pain	afterward?	She	couldn’t	go	through	that kind	of	heartache	again,	she	decided.	Better	to	bail	quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,	I’ve	already	got	plans	for	tonight.	But	I	hope	you	enjoy	your	visit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	disconnected	and	took	a	deep	breath.	She’d	been	polite,	her	voice	steady. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Good	job.	When	the	phone	rang	again,	she	glanced	at	the	readout,	took	another</p>
<p class="calibre1">—deeper—breath	before	answering.	“Let’s	blame	a	poor	connection.	I’ve	got plans	for	tonight,”	she	repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	about	tomorrow?	Saturday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	gripped	the	receiver	as	though	it	were	a	life	preserver.	“Afraid	not.	I’m booked.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	fact,	I’m	looking	at	my	calendar	right	now,”	she	said,	with	a	quick	glance	at it,	“and	every	day	has	something	scheduled.	I’m	sorry,	but	I’ve	really	gotta	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	said	before,	have	a	nice	visit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Replacing	the	phone	gently	in	the	cradle,	she	shivered.	A	whole	body	shiver.	She hadn’t	lied.	Her	life	was	busy—and	calm—just	the	way	she	liked	it.	She	and Doug	had	simply	drifted	apart,	following	their	own	paths	in	their	own	worlds.	At this	point,	she	didn’t	need	any	emotional	upheavals.	She	studied	her	computer screen,	and	in	minutes,	she	was	once	again	Jennifer	Delaney,	happy	career woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">At	five-thirty,	Jen	was	surrounded	by	co-workers	who’d	become	friends,	all	set to	kick	back	and	hit	the	clubs.	That’s	what	twentysomethings	did	on	a	Friday night	in	Boston.	And	she	loved	a	good	time	as	much	as	anyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	just	about	ready,”	she	said,	smiling,	as	she	logged	out	of	her	computer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	stood	outside	her	office	door—two	guys	and	two	gals—all	trying	to	prove themselves,	but	still	believing	the	theory	about	all	work	and	no	play.	Her	friends</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>were	certainly	not	dull.	Not	these	bright,	energetic,	career-minded	people.	They were	her	friends	for	a	reason! </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	changed	her	high	heels	for	flat	sandals,	grabbed	her	purse,	rose	and	joined the	others.	“I’m	hungry.	Where	are	we	eating?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alexis	laughed,	her	brown	eyes	shining.	“You	mean	we’re	not	sampling	the freebies	at	every	bar’s	happy	hour	and	saving	on	dinner?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	geez.	I’m	not	that	bad,	am	I?”	Jen	protested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	friends	simply	stared.	“When	it	comes	to	spending	money,	let’s	just	say—</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re	frugal,”	said	Alexis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	held	up	her	hands.	“Okay,	okay…guilty	as	charged.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	that	we’re	complaining,”	chimed	in	Liz,	with	a	chuckle.	“Living	in Beantown	is	expensive,	and	saving	is	a	challenge.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I’m	conceding	right	now,”	said	Matthew.	“Some	of	us	need	real	food!	Not just	peanuts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	go	home	to	your	mama,	and	get	a	good	meal,”	said	Liz,	reaching	up	to	pat him	on	the	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	laughed	as	they	piled	into	the	elevator,	but	Jen	sensed	new	vibes.	Matt and	Liz.	The	young	woman’s	gentle	teasing,	her	tender	touching	was	becoming	a habit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	elevator	deposited	them	in	the	spacious	marble	lobby	of	the	building,	and the	group	headed	toward	the	plate	glass	doors	leading	to	the	plaza	outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	days	are	getting	longer	and	warmer,”	said	Matt,	holding	the	door	open	for the	others,	“which	means	our	playtime	is	longer,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	chatter	continued,	but	when	Jen	stepped	outside,	she	heard	nothing	more, and	saw	nothing	except	the	tall	man	with	a	hank	of	dark	hair	falling	over	his forehead,	the	man	whom	she’d	once	labeled	skinny	but	wasn’t	anymore,	the	man who’d	once	held	her	heart.	Surprise	held	her	frozen	until	a	slow	anger	warmed her	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>She	watched	him,	and	by	his	stillness,	identified	the	moment	he	spotted	her.	One second,	two	seconds.	He	waited,	but	made	no	move	toward	her,	as	though	afraid she’d	disappear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	came	the	smile,	the	smile	that	once	had	melted	her	heart.	She	used	to	run her	fingers	over	his	mouth,	outlining	his	lips,	kissing	them.	But	that	was	then…</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	hands	clenched	into	fists	as	he	finally	approached.	She	moved	closer	to	her friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hang	on	a	sec,”	she	whispered,	her	throat	dry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	halted	instantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	wrong,	Jen?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	couldn’t	speak.	Doug	was	only	six	feet	from	them	now,	filling	her	vision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	suddenly,	he	was	there.	Right	in	front	of	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	Jennifer	Grace	Delaney.	I’ve	missed	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No!	Taller,	bigger	than	in	her	memory.	And	his	eyes,	still	so	dark,	darker	than	a moonless	night	is	how	she	used	to	think	of	them.	A	kaleidoscope	of remembrances	hit	her	at	once,	and	her	initial	anger	ebbed,	replaced	by	an	eon	of past	loneliness	and	disappointment.	And	right	now,	fear.	She	wouldn’t	survive	a repetition	of	the	past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	is	this	guy?”	Her	four	friends	surrounded	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	gulped	some	air,	raised	her	chin.	“Someone	I	used	to	know.	An	old college…uh…classmate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	friends	were	astute.	Their	eyes	focused	on	him,	then	Jen,	their	curiosity apparent.	He	didn’t	care	about	her	friends—what	they	saw,	heard	or	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only	Jen	was	real.	And	more	beautiful	than	in	his	dreams. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An	old	classmate,	huh?”	he	repeated.	“That’s	a	funny	way	to	describe	what	we had.”	He	focused	on	her	face.	“This	guy,”	he	said,	echoing	her	friend’s	question, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>“is	the	man	who	can’t	forget	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	eyelids	slammed	shut,	her	mouth	trembled	before	tightening.	When	she opened	her	eyes	again,	however,	her	gaze	was	steady.	“It’s	been	years,	Doug.	As the	saying	goes,	‘that	was	then,	this	is	now.’	Maybe	you	need	to	try	harder	to…</p>
<p class="calibre1">ah…forget.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	moved	back,	Jen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	no,	you	haven’t,”	she	countered,	her	surprise	laced	with	confusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Returning	didn’t	make	sense	at	all.	“Playwrights	live	in	New	York.	We	tried once,	and	it	didn’t	work.	I’m	sorry,	Doug,	but	I’ve	moved	on.	She	turned	toward her	friends.	“It’s	time	to	leave.	We’re	all	starving.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	yet.	Not	without	him.	He	held	out	both	hands,	palms	up.	“Eight	million people	in	New	York,”	he	said,	slightly	bouncing	his	left	hand.	“And	one	Henny-Penny	here.”	He	lifted	his	right	arm	high.	“No	contest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shrugged.	“You	didn’t	think	so	back	then.	You’re	very	good	with	words, images	and	make-believe.	While	I,	in	case	you’ve	forgotten,	deal	with	real people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stepped	toward	him,	her	purse	falling	to	the	ground,	her	friends	closing ranks	behind	her.	“Real	people,	Collins,	like	the	Delaney	family.	Not	your ordinary	kind	of	family.	Just	a	bunch	of	kids	trying	to	survive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Good.	Talk	to	me.	Keep	on	talking.	Communication	is	everything. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	he	could	say	a	word,	she	turned	to	her	friends	again.	A	girl	handed	her the	purse.	“Sorry	for	the	drama,”	Jen	said.	“It’s	the	way	he	makes	his	living. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s	good	at	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Him?	What	about	you?”	a	guy	said.	“A	new	side	of	the	mysterious	Jennifer Delaney.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	he’d	gotten	to	her,	past	her	defenses.	He	wanted	to	cheer.	The	men	were merely	co-workers.	If	they	thought	of	her	as	mysterious,	she’d	kept	her	private life	private.	Which	meant	no	boyfriends.	Regardless	of	what	she’d	said	earlier, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>she	hadn’t	moved	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Which	gave	him	hope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	all	he	needed	was	a	little	 <i class="calibre4">chutzpah </i>	to	make	his	next	move	and	be	accepted by	Jen’s	friends.	“I	remember	a	great	club	near	here,”	he	said,	deliberately placing	himself	in	the	middle	of	the	group.	“Lots	of	eats,	lots	of	music,	and	a karaoke	bar.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	had	turned	away,	but	he	saw	her	stiffen.	Tapping	her	on	the	shoulder,	he	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	we’ll	have	fun.	At	least	a	song	or	two.	Come	on,	Jen…I	dare	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dare	her?	Like	in	the	old	days,	except	those	were	happy	times	with	music	and	a microphone.	Right	now,	she	wanted	the	privacy	of	her	own	apartment.	She needed	to	regain	her	equilibrium,	to	brace	herself	for	whatever	came	next.	But	if she	left,	Doug	would	accuse	her	of	running	away.	Again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pasting	a	smile	on	her	face,	Jen	said,	“All	that	goofing	around	in	college?	Nah.	I don’t	do	that	anymore.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	threw	a	speaking	glance	at	her	girlfriends.	They	loved	to	kick	back	at	the sing-along	karaoke	bars.	Jen	had	the	real	voice,	but	they	all	had	fun.	Now, however,	she	knew	her	pals	would	cover	for	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	prove	it,”	said	Doug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	shaking	his	head.	“You	always	enjoyed	being	on	a	cozy	stage.	I	can’t believe	you’ve	changed	that	much.	And	you’re	good!	Let’s	go	to	a	club,	Jen.	For old	times’	sake.	After	all,	I	am	new	in	town….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	pu-leeze,”	she	shot	back.	“You	know	this	city	like	a	native.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	been	a	few	years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	turned	to	the	others.	“I’m	sorry	about	all	this.	Do	you	mind	if	we	skip	the pubs	and	go	right	to	Maguire’s?	Real	food	for	the	starving	plus	live	music,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>then	I’ll	go	home.	I’ve	got	an	early	choir	rehearsal	tomorrow	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	like	this	situation,”	said	Evan,	a	quiet	type	who	missed	nothing.	“Just say	the	word,	Jen,	and	we’ll	get	rid	of…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh,	no!	She	patted	the	man’s	arm.	“I’m	fine,	Evan.	Really.	He’s	not	dangerous, except	with	a	pen!”	She	smiled	at	him.	“But	thanks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five	years	building	a	life,	and	in	five	minutes,	Doug	Collins	could	tear	it	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	couldn’t	chance	another	disappointment.	Why	had	he	come	back	after	all this	time?	Glancing	at	her	watch,	she	sighed.	One	hour	or	so	was	all	she’d	have to	endure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Irish	bar	was	filling	up,	but	they	managed	to	get	a	booth	for	six	immediately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	sighed	again,	happy	with	their	good	luck,	happy	to	keep	to	her	one-hour plan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Almost	as	immediately,	Doug	seemed	comfortable	with	the	group	and	made	her friends	feel	comfortable	with	him.	Not	surprising.	He	had	always	been	the proverbial	“people	person.”	She’d	credit	his	many	psychology	courses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evan’s	quiet	voice,	however,	managed	to	interrupt	the	general	conversation about	the	menu	and	music.	“So,	Collins,	what	brings	you	back	to	Boston?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	curious	silence	descended,	and	for	the	first	time,	Doug	seemed	to	search	for words.	Jen’s	ears	perked	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	say,”	he	began	slowly,	“a	couple	of	new	projects	and	one	item	of unfinished	business.	Very	important	unfinished	business.”	From	diagonally across	the	table,	he	shifted	toward	Jen,	his	eyes	capturing	hers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sat	straighter.	“If	you	mean	me,	you’re	mistaken,”	she	said,	leaning	forward, arms	on	the	table.	“Our	‘business,’	as	you	call	it,	is	over.	Nothing	personal—</p>
<p class="calibre1">though	I	guess	you’d	think	it	was—but	I’m	not	looking	for	a	relationship	with you	or	anyone	else.	Just	not	my	thing.”  <i class="calibre4">Not	anymore. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	quality	of	the	following	silence	morphed	from	curious	to	deafening.	She realized	that	in	all	her	years	with	the	company,	she’d	revealed	more	about	herself</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>just	then	than	ever	before.	And	now	to	prevent	speculation—and	gossip—she’d have	to	explain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	glanced	around	the	table,	finding	sympathy	laced	with	curiosity	in	her friends’	expressions.	Okay.	She	could	handle	that.	Her	message,	however,	was meant	for	Doug.	She	returned	her	gaze	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	my	world,”	she	began,	“people	leave.	First	my	parents—and	you	have	no idea	what	that	was	like—and	then	you,	and	I	wasn’t	sure	about	Mike	and	Lisa staying	together	either.	I	know	you	have	to	accept	what’s	out	of	your	control, like	a	car	accident	on	an	icy	road.	But	I’m	not	going	to	volunteer	for	more heartache	and	grief.	My	life	is	great	as	it	is.	Your	being	in	Boston	is	totally immaterial	to	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	it	seems,”	he	said	softly,	“that	I	have	a	lot	of	work	to	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	waitress	approached,	and	conversation	turned	to	food	and	drink.	“Just	a	cup of	chicken	soup,”	said	Jen.	“I’ve	lost	my	appetite.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	him	tagging	along	wasn’t	a	good	idea,”	said	Evan,	nodding	toward Doug.	“You’ve	managed	to	upset	Jen,	who’s	a	very	cool	woman.	So,	let’s	get	the whole	picture.	Why	else	are	you	here?	What	kind	of	projects?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	looked	at	her	co-worker.	Who	would	have	thought	that	this	quiet	guy	would speak	up	now?	Still	waters….? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	shifted	in	his	seat.	His	gaze	swept	both	sides	of	the	booth.	“I’m	a	writer.	I worked	hard	and	got	lucky,	too.	I	have	a	new	play,	and	its	debut	will	be	here with	the	Commonwealth	Regional	Theater	company.	And	that’s	as	far	as	I’m thinking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	heard	nothing	after	Commonwealth.	Her	choir,	The	All-City	Chorus, rehearsed	at	that	theater	twice	a	week,	and	she’d	be	there	in	the	morning.	“‘Of all	the	gin	joints…’”	she	murmured. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’d	never	doubted	his	talent,	and	she’d	been	right.	His	very	first	play	had	been staged	in	college.	A	rare	honor.	He’d	been	thrilled,	of	course,	but	shy	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	used	to	say	that	writers	were	too	insecure	to	brag.	And	now,	he’d	been modest	in	front	of	her	friends.	It	seemed	he’d	been	totally	focused	on	his	craft while	living	in	New	York. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>“Congratulations,”	she	offered.	“Sounds	like	you’ll	be	busy	with	rehearsals	and whatever—for	a	little	while,	and	after	a	successful	run	here,	poof!	Back	to Broadway.	Works	well	for	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Writing	your	own	script,	Jen?”	Doug’s	eyes	gleamed.	“Sorry	to	disappoint.	I didn’t	renew	the	lease	on	my	New	York	apartment	because….I’m	also	this	year’s playwright-in-residence	at	our	alma	mater.	If	 <i class="calibre4">The	Sanctuary </i>	goes	to	Broadway, I’ll	commute.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	needed	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	back,	Jen.	And	tomorrow	I’m	hunting	for	new	digs.	I	can’t	stay	with	my sister	indefinitely.	Any	suggestions?”	His	glance	traveled	from	Jen	to	the	others, and	she	sighed	in	relief	at	the	change	of	topic.	An	objective,	neutral	topic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boston	sported	a	dozen	or	more	neighborhoods	attractive	to	singles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	really	depends	on	your	budget,”	said	Liz.	“In	this	town,	a	one-bedroom	can run	anywhere	from	sixteen	hundred	to	double	that	a	month.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	like	to	be	close	to	the	theater,	if	possible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	that	would	be	downtown,”	said	Evan	slowly.	“A	great	choice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Could	the	night	get	any	worse?	First	the	theater,	now	Jen’s	neighborhood—a walking	neighborhood	where	she	could	run	into	him	at	any	time.	“I	doubt	he	can afford	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	unison,	all	eyes	turned	toward	first	toward	her,	then	toward	Doug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	got	a	point,	man,”	said	Even.	“But	there	are	other	great	locations.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	sure	are,”	said	Jen	calmly	now.	“Many	good	areas.	You	don’t	need	to	be downtown.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug’s	eyes	narrowed.	“Any	particular	reason,	Henny-Penny?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz	coughed	and	hid	her	mouth.	Matt	looked	away.	Not	a	shred	of	acting material	in	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	reason	at	all.”	Jen	waved	her	arm	in	dismissal.	“Search	the	whole	city. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>Means	nothing	to	me	if	you	go	into	debt.”	Deflection	might	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	crying	out	loud,	I	might	have	known,”	said	Doug	with	a	sigh.	“The	starving playwright	thing….	Well,	I’m	not	quite	there,	and	you	don’t	have	to	worry	I’ll	be asking	for	a	loan.	I	do	know	how	to	budget.”	He	chuckled	and	looked	around	the table,	making	eye	contact	with	each	person	for	a	moment.	“Although	I	seem	to be	in	a	minority	among	the	financial	whizzes	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	laughed.	“Financial	whizzes	believe	in	budgets,	too,”	said	Liz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	knows?”	Doug	said.	“One	day	soon,	I	might	be	asking	for	advice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	that’s	when	Jen	knew	that	Doug	had	turned	her	friends	into	his	friends,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	2</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	signed	her	bill	and	got	ready	to	leave.	Hanging	around	for	an	evening	with Doug	was	not	going	to	happen.	And	she	 <i class="calibre4">did </i>	have	a	rehearsal	in	the	morning—</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	that	an	early	start	time	had	ever	impeded	her	evening	activities	in	the	past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hang	on	a	sec.	Look,	Jen,	karaoke’s	about	to	start.	Go	on.	Sing.	Remember	way back	one	Christmas	in	Woodhaven…?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh,	God.	Don’t	go	there…don’t	go	back	to	a	time	when	happy	endings beckoned.	When	she	used	to	look	as	eager	and	hopeful	as	Doug	did	right	now! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Would	it	be	easier	to	sing	something	and	put	an	end	to	all	this	nonsense?	As	a kaleidoscope	of	titles	flashed	through	her	mind,	she	smiled	her	herself.	Perfect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’d	send	him	a	musical	message. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you’re	sure	you	want	a	song	from	me,	okay.	But	don’t	complain	afterwards.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Escaping	the	booth,	she	quickly	made	her	way	to	the	emcee.	He	worked	the	gig every	weekend	and	knew	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jennifer	Delaney!	Lucky	us,”	he	greeted	her,	handing	her	the	mic	and	the	song list.	“What’s	on	for	tonight?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	scanned	the	list.	“Right	there,”	she	said,	pointing	at	Gloria	Gaynor’s	name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	get	the	place	hopping.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man’s	eyes	widened.	“Okay	with	me,	sweetheart.	Nail	it.”	He	turned	toward the	diners.	“To	start	the	evening	off,	we	have	one	of	Boston’s	own,	one	of	our regulars	—	and	I	think	she’s	ready	to	rock	the	house!”	With	a	flourish,	he	handed the	mic	to	her.	She	grasped	it	as	though	she	were	in	a	concert	arena,	twirled	and waved	at	the	audience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ready?”	Their	noise	assured	her.	She	nodded	at	the	emcee.	“Let’s	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	piano	chords	echoed,	her	voice	accompanied	them.  <i class="calibre4">I	Will	Survive…. </i>	And she	took	the	crowd	through	the	heroine’s	story.	How	the	boyfriend	tried	to	hurt her	by	leaving.	And	then	the	outrage	of	him	showing	up	again,	uninvited.	But,  <i class="calibre4">I</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a> <i class="calibre4">Will	Survive. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	only	when	she	reached	the	end	that	her	personal	lightbulb	blazed, illuminating	the	truth	she’d	hidden	so	well.	She,	too,	still	had	a	lot	of	love	to give	and	to	share.	It	flowed	through	her	with	promise	and	warmth.	Doug	Collins could	no	longer	block	the	feelings	she’d	held	frozen	in	place,	preventing	her from	reaching	for	a	full	life.	Only	she	had	that	power.	Perhaps	he’d	actually	done her	a	favor	by	showing	up.	He	didn’t	own	her	heart,	not	anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	held	the	mic	while	the	crowd	applauded	and	whistled.	She	didn’t	hear	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	a	feeling,”	she	whispered.	“I’m	finally	free	to	be…me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	was	quite	a	performance,”	said	Doug,	quietly.	“Message	received,	but	I’ll walk	you	home	anyway.	It’s	a	long	trek	to	Beacon	Hill.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beacon	Hill?	She’d	moved	out	of	her	sister’s	home	three	years	ago.	Her decision.	A	big	decision.	But	she	had	grown	up	since	the	tragedy,	no	longer	that frightened	sixteen-year-old	girl	caught	in	a	whirlwind	of	anger,	fear,	and…grief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	girl	who	had	searched	for	hope	and	finally	the	courage	to	spread	her	wings—a little	bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stared	at	Doug,	who	had	started	to	leave	the	table,	glad	he	was	clueless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	thanks.	I’m	quite	capable	of	making	my	own	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	you’re	capable…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	luck	with	your	apartment	hunting.”	She	waved	him	back,	headed	toward the	exit,	then	called	out	over	her	shoulder,	“Why	don’t	you	try	Cambridge	or	the Seaport?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	cell	rang	as	soon	as	she	hit	the	street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mike!	Hi—" </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lisa’s	water	broke,”	he	began	without	preamble.	“The	baby’s	coming	earlier than	expected,	and	Emily’s	at	a	rehearsal.	Can	you	get	here	right	away	to	stay with	Bobby?”	His	voice	was	tight,	his	words	rushed.	Her	brother-in-law definitely	did	not	sound	like	Mike	Brennen,	confident	quarterback	of	the	Boston</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>Riders,	a	position	he’d	held	for	ten	years.	He	sounded	like	a	worried	husband. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	you	all	go	straight	to	the	hospital,”	Jen	said,	“and	I’ll	meet	you there.	Saves	time.	Seems	like	the	baby	can’t	wait	to	make	an	appearance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great	idea.	See	you	in	a	few.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walking	was	not	an	option	now.	Uber.	She	needed	Uber.	She	searched	her	phone apps,	made	the	call	and	paced	outside	the	restaurant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five	minutes	could	be	an	eternity.	She	barely	noticed	the	noise	when	customers entered	or	left	the	place.	She	barely	heard	the	karaoke	music.	She	did	recognize a	familiar	male	voice,	however,	call	her	name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jen…what	are	you	still	doing	here?	I	thought…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Change	of	plans,	and	look…here’s	my	ride.”	She	charged	inside	the	car	without waiting	for	driver	to	open	her	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Brigham	and	Women’s—you	know	where	that	is,	right?	And	step	on	it!”	She slammed	the	door	shut	and	looked	outside	to	see	a	puzzled	Doug	gazing	after	the cab. </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	hours	later,	after	returning	with	little	Bobby	to	her	sister’s	house,	she cuddled	with	her	nephew,	reading	the	three-year-old	just	one	more	story	while his	eyelids	drifted	closed.	She	inhaled	the	clean,	little-boy	aroma	of	baby shampoo	and	snuggled	in	for	a	goodnight	kiss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sweet	baby,”	she	whispered.	“Your	Auntie	Jen	loves	you	very	much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	heard	a	contented	sigh,	then	another,	and	tiptoed	from	the	room,	leaving	the door	open.	Taking	one	more	glance,	she	chuckled	at	the	sight	of	his	nerf	football under	one	arm	and	his	favorite	worn-out	blankie	under	the	other.	At	the	end	of the	hall,	she	descended	to	the	main	floor	of	the	brick	Tudor,	the	home	of	her teenage	and	college	days,	the	roomy	suite	on	the	top	floor	perfect	for	the adolescent	girl	she	had	been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According	to	Mike,	the	Beacon	Street	house	would	always	be	home	to	Lisa’s</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>siblings.	In	time,	he’d	become	the	legal	guardian	along	with	Lisa,	to	Jen’s younger	sister	and	brothers.	And	Jen	had	been	Lisa’s	right-hand	gal	from	the beginning.	Her	twin	brothers	were	still	in	college	with	two	years	to	go,	and Emily,	sweet,	talented	Emily,	had	just	turned	eighteen	and	had	taken	over	Jen’s suite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	heard	the	sound	of	a	key	in	the	front	door	and	glanced	at	her	watch	just	as the	door	opened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jenny!	I	didn’t	know	you	were	coming	tonight.”	Emily	rushed	forward,	violin case	in	hand,	and	hugged	her	sister,	then	looked	around.	“Where	is	everyone?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bobby’s	sleeping	upstairs,	maybe	dreaming	about	his	new	baby	sister.	Come into	the	kitchen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Em’s	complexion	had	paled.	“It’s	too	soon.	Isn’t	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	a	little.	Mike	said	everything’s	fine.	The	baby	is	just…just	petite.”	Jen pressed	her	lips	together.	“She’s	in	an	incubator,	but	all	her	systems	are	working. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Breathing	on	her	own.	No	tubes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	that’s	good.	Right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	that’s	very	good.	She	just	needs	time	to	grow.	And	I	need	you	to	stay home	tomorrow	morning	with	Bobby-boy.	Mike’ll	be	at	the	hospital	with	Lisa, and	I	have	a	mandatory	rehearsal.	The	concert’s	in	two	weeks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	seemed	like	a	year	before	Emily	responded.	“I	can	change	my	practice	time tomorrow.”	The	teen	paused,	looked	at	Lisa	with	shiny	eyes	and	quivering	lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	do	bad	things	always	happen	in	this	family?	Why	is	everything	so	hard? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	Lisa’s	little	baby	has…has…to	struggle.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stepping	close	to	her	sister,	Jen	wrapped	her	arms	around	her.	“Every	family	has bad	stuff,	Em.	But	we	Delaneys	are	tough.	The	baby,	too.	They’re	naming	her Brianna.	Do	you	know	what	that	name	means?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emily	shook	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Strong.	It	means	strong.	Brianna	Grace	will	be	as	strong	as	we	are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>“Oh-h,	she	has	mom’s	name,	too.”	With	that,	Emily	took	out	her	violin,	and	Jen knew	exactly	what	to	expect.  <i class="calibre4">Amazing	Grace. </i>	The	prayer	her	protégé	sister played	every	night	before	bed	to	connect	her	to	their	mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	strong,”	whispered	Emily,	tucking	the	instrument	under	her	chin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Except	when	I’m	playing.	When	I’m	with	Mozart,	when	I’m	lost	in	that world…nothing	can	hurt	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen’s	breath	whooshed	out,	and	she	clasped	her	sister’s	shoulders.	“You—and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">—are	stronger	than	we	think,	Emily.	That’s	what	I’ve	learned.	We	are	as	strong as	we	need	to	be.	Your	world—even	without	Mozart—would	be	fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">And	I’m	a	fine	one	to	talk.	She	needs	Mozart	like	I	needed	Gloria	Gaynor. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Emily	whispered,	“I	can’t	believe	that	this	year	is	my	last	one	with	the	Boston Youth	Symphony.	I	don’t	want	it	to	end.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Change.	Her	little	sister	was	afraid	of	change.	Jen	understood	that	too	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	honey.	You’re	heading	into	your	next	adventure	is	all.	First,	Tanglewood this	summer.	Didn’t	you	say	Maestro	Perlman	would	be	there	again	this	year? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	the	New	England	Conservatory.	Come	on,	play	for	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Where	was	Mike	when	she	needed	him?	Elite	quarterbacks	knew	how	to	handle</i> <i class="calibre4">people.	She	was	the	worst	psychologist	in	the	world. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Emily’s	first	note	brought	Jen’s	thoughts	to	a	halt.	No	matter	how	often	she heard	her	sister	play,	she	always	forgot	how	magnificent	her	music	was.	She recognized	Mozart’s	 <i class="calibre4">A	Little	Night	Music. </i>	Emily’s	eyes	had	closed,	her	bow flew	as	if	of	its	own	accord,	and	Jen	knew	the	girl	had,	indeed,	become	part	of another	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	waited	a	bit	before	approaching.	“Enough,	Em.	You	need	to	be	awake	for Bobby	in	the	morning	and	focus	on	him.	Mundane,	real	world	stuff.	Got	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dreamy	eyes	sparkled.	“I	think	I	can	handle	my	nephew.	You	go	to	your rehearsal.	No	worries.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Right.	In	the	Delaney	family,	there	were	always	worries.	But	she	wouldn’t	let Doug	Collins	be	one	of	them.	She	hadn’t	even	mentioned	him	to	Emily,	which</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>proved	her	point.	He	was	forgettable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	minutes	before	ten	o’clock	the	next	morning,	Jen	greeted	other	members of	the	All-City	Chorus	in	the	lobby	of	the	Commonwealth	Theater.	Excitement reverberated.	The	group	had	only	two	full	rehearsals	left	before	their performance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“People!	People.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	turned	toward	the	speaker	and	listened.	“We’ve	got	an	almost	sold-out house.	Our	reputation	is	growing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or	we’ve	coerced	more	family	and	friends	to	buy	tickets!”	joked	one	of	the singers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	chuckled	along	with	the	rest.	Sure,	family	and	friends	would	attend,	but	also music	lovers	and	supporters	of	community	talent.	She	loved	being	part	of	this volunteer	chorus.	It	seemed	to	round	out	her	family	time	and	career	interests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	it	added	to	her	social	life.	Girlfriends.	Guy	friends.	Her	days	were	full. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Busy.	No	lonely	moments.	She	made	sure	of	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	morning,	Henny-Penny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	froze	for	a	moment,	and	her	heart	raced.  <i class="calibre4">Keep	your	cool,	Jen. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Pivoting	slowly,	she	finally	nodded.	“Good	morning,	ramblin’	man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	winced.	“Five	years	in	New	York.	Hardly	rambling.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Depends	on	your	outlook,	I	guess.	Sorry,	I’ve	got	to	get	inside	and	on	stage with	the	others.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’s	Lisa	doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse	me?”	Her	thoughts	whirled.	Nothing	about	the	birth	was	in	the	papers today.	She’d	checked	before	leaving	her	apartment.	Boston	loved	their	QB,	and Mike’s	life	was	public—most	of	the	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>“Deduction...and	a	hunch.	I	heard	your	directions	to	the	driver	last	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brigham	and	Women’s.	And	you	were	speaking	with	Mike.”	He	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lisa’s	doing	just	fine.”	And	that’s	all	she’d	give	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	expression	softened.	“I’m	glad,	Jen.	Very	glad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	gentle	voice,	so	warm	and	caring,	reminded	her	of	the	man	she	used	to know.	Her	heart	ached	for	a	moment,	but	she	avoided	his	glance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	held	the	heavy	door	open,	and	she	walked	through,	feeling	his	eyes	track	her progress	to	the	front	of	the	theater.	She	joined	the	mezzo-sopranos	on	stage,	all the	while	fighting	the	urge	to	turn	around.	When	she	couldn’t	postpone	it	a moment	longer,	her	glance	darted	to	the	door	in	the	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gone.	He	was	gone.	She	sensed	her	relief,	then	her	disappointment.	Now	 <i class="calibre4">that</i> was	something	she	needed	to	figure	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lowering	her	gaze	when	she	detected	movement,	she	saw	Doug	settling	into	an aisle	seat	as	though	he	had	all	the	time	in	the	world.	What	had	happened	to	the apartment	search?	His	work	with	the	new	play?	Where	were	his	actors?	Time was	money.	Not	that	she	knew	where	his	funding	came	from,	but	still…he seemed	to	be	wasting	both	time	and	money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	her	business.	She	focused	on	the	choral	conductor	and	put	Doug	out	of	her mind,	where	he	belonged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Four-part	harmonies,	solos,	duets—	the	group	had	worked	on	a	variety	of	ways to	represent	the	Great	American	Songbook,	the	most	enduring	songs	from	the 1920’s	through	the	1950’s.	Jen’s	mouth	often	trembled	at	the	memories	this music	called	up.	In	her	mind’s	eye	were	pictures	of	herself	singing	with	her mom,	dad	and	Lisa	as	they	cleaned	up	the	kitchen	after	dinner	every	night.	Each one	could	carry	a	mighty	tune,	each	voice	blending	with	the	others.	“Just	like	the Von	Trapp	family,”	her	dad	would	offer	with	a	grin.	His	eyes	twinkled	and	his smile	never	faltered	as	the	family	made	short	work	of	the	cleanup.	A	happy	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then…she	shuddered…only	the	five	kids	remained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	blinked	and	willed	herself	back	to	the	present.	Memories	could	still	bite.	She viewed	the	music	binder	in	front	of	her,	paid	attention	to	the	conductor,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>allowed	herself	to	become	immersed	in	the	practice.	A	full	rehearsal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corrections.	Improvements.	More	than	a	hundred	voices	strong	accompanied	by a	piano	and	small	chamber	group	of	instruments.	Her	jazz	solo	came	just	before intermission.  <i class="calibre4">Summertime </i>	from	Porgy	and	Bess.	By	the	time	she	took	the	mic, she	was	ready.	She	eyed	the	conductor,	listened	for	the	musical	intro. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	smoky	voice	gave	sympathetic	quality	to	the	words,	while	the	backup chorus	added	a	spiritual	mood.	Like	Emily,	she	could	have	been	alone	as	she	got lost	in	the	music,	in	the	emotional	depth	of	the	song	and	the	atmosphere	it evoked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence	followed	her	last	note.	Silence	before	the	congrats	and	spontaneous applause.	She	was	jerked	from	her	inner	world,	saw	and	heard	the	approval	from her	peers.	She’d	put	herself	into	it	and	knew	she	wouldn’t	be	able	to	sing	better on	performance	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	gaze	traveled	to	the	back	of	the	auditorium.	Doug’s	seat	was	empty,	but	the door	behind	him	was	swinging	shut.	Perhaps	his	reappearance	had	sparked memories	she’d	carefully	packed	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	presence	was	getting	to	her.	She	had	to	admit	that	truth.	They’d	been	happy together	for	four	years.	Maturing,	sharing…trusting.	So	sweet	and	good.	Could she	have	acted	too	hastily?	She	didn’t	know.	But	that	was	then.	What	she	did know	was	that	she	needed	to	move	on	with	her	life,	a	full	life,	but	a	life	she could	control. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	3</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	late.	Only	Jen	could	have	made	him	lose	track	of	time,	place	and purpose.	It	wasn’t	just	her	voice,	it	was	the	whole	package.	The	girl	he remembered	had	evolved	into	a	woman.	A	woman	who	didn’t	want	any	part	of him	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	made	his	way	to	the	management	office	of	the	theater,	secured	keys	to	the building’s	side	door	and	workshop	rooms	he	and	the	cast	would	be	using,	and took	the	stairs	to	the	third	floor.	A	large	conference	room	would	be	fine	for	the initial	readings.	He’d	meet	the	regional	theater’s	creative	team	—	producer	and director	—	in	person	the	next	day,	and	auditions	would	begin	the	day	after.	The call	had	gone	out,	and	he	had	a	solid	list	of	local	actors	to	consider. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Staging	a	play	was	a	cooperative	venture.	The	most	important	part	to	Doug, however,	was	the	play	itself.	The	writing	always	was.	With	two	successful	works behind	him	in	New	York—and	he	still	marveled	at	his	luck—	he’d	now	begin the	intense	challenge	of	bringing	a	new	story	to	life.	He	couldn’t	be	happier…</p>
<p class="calibre1">professionally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	rearranged	chairs,	checked	electrical	outlets	and	touched	base	with	his director	and	producer.	They	sounded	as	excited	as	Doug.	After	depositing	a	load of	pads	and	pens	on	the	table,	he	made	his	way	downstairs,	pausing	to	peek	into the	auditorium.	Jen’s	rehearsal	was	still	going	strong.	He	headed	to	the	exit	door, and	almost	bumped	into	a	young	woman	with	a	little	boy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whoa.	Sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	okay,”	she	said.	“Come	on,	Bobby.”	She	shifted	the	case	she	carried	and took	the	child’s	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	looked	again.	A	violin	case.	He	studied	the	girl.	“Emily?	Is	that	you,	all grown	up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	brows	came	together,	a	frown	appeared	as	she	studied	him.	And	slowly,	her forehead	cleared.	“Oh,	I	recognize	you.	Jen’s	boyfriend	from	long	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>Long	ago.	Well,	in	a	young	girl’s	life,	five	years	would	be	a	long	time.	“Doug Collins.”	He	held	out	his	hand.	“You	were	such	a	little	thing	when	I	first	met you.	Maybe	about	nine	years	old.”	He	felt	himself	pause.	The	child	had	had	real problems.	“How	are	you	doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	slow	smile	reassured	him.	“Fine,	but	I’m	running	late.	I	hope	Jen’s	rehearsal is	over	before	mine	begins.	Hey!	Does	she	know	you’re	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	yeah.	I	saw	her	last	night,	as	a	matter	of	fact.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?”	She	turned	away.	“Well,	I’ve	gotta	go	now.	C’mon,	little	man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	the	“little	man”	had	thrown	his	nerf	football	down	the	hall	and	was	diving	in for	a…. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Touchdown!	Auntie	Emmy,	Auntie	Emmy!	See?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I	see	all	right.	Let’s	go	find	your	Auntie	Jen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	boy	took	Emily’s	hand	without	a	fuss,	and	Doug	watched	them	enter	the auditorium.	His	appointment	with	a	Realtor	was	coming	up,	but	mumbling	“just five	minutes,”	he	followed	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	heard	her	nephew	before	she	saw	Emily.	Wasn’t	her	sister	a	bit	early?	From her	seat	near	the	front	of	the	theater,	she	waved	them	to	her.	And	then	she	saw Doug	behind	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Darn	it!	Had	they	met	already?	What	crummy	luck.	She	stepped	closer	to	greet them	and	swung	her	nephew	into	her	arms.	“Making	TD’s,	Bobby?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	child	grinned	wide	enough	that	his	six	front	teeth	were	revealed	to	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Daddy’s	in	hop-i-tal	with	Mommy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	a	sister,	Bobby.	Isn’t	that	wonderful?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	chimed	in	next.	“And	you’re	the	big	brother.	That	little	baby	is	lucky	to have	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>Emily	rolled	her	eyes	toward	Doug	and	gave	Jen	an	inquiring	glance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sighing,	Jen	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	car’s	outside,”	said	Emily.	“That	was	Mike’s	idea,	and	Luis	will	take	me	to BU’s	rehearsal	hall.	Sorry	if	I	showed	up	early.	I’m	a	bit	nervous.	Here’s Bobby’s	tote	bag	with	extra	clothes	and	sandwiches.	What	time	shall	I	tell	Luis to	pick	you	up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	stay	any	longer,	now	that	our	big	boy	is	here.	I’ll	tell	the	conductor	I’m leaving,	but	at	least	my	solo	is	as	good	as	I	can	get	it….”	Thinking	out	loud,	she began	putting	words	to	action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Slow	down	a	sec,”	said	Doug.	“I’ll	look	after	him	if	you	don’t	want	to	leave yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	okay	with	him.”	Jen	turned	toward	her	sister.	“Tell	Luis	I’ll	find	my	own way	home.	Not	to	worry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	guess	your	place,	since	it’s	closer,	or	the	house?	Lisa	will	want	to	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Geez.	“Thanks,	Em.”	Now	Doug	would	know	where	she	lived.	“I’ll	call	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,	just	go.”	Emily	gave	Bobby	a	kiss	and	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jennifer	faced	Doug,	her	chin	raised.	“I	feel	like	you’re	crowding	me,	Doug.	You said	you	returned	to	Boston	for	your	career.	I	hope	that’s	true.	I	hope	you’re using	your	imagination	strictly	for	creating	your	plays	and	not	for	anything	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thanks	for	the	offer,	but	I	don’t	need	you	to	babysit	Bobby,	and	I	don’t	want	to go	backwards.	After	five	years…Let’s	just	leave	it	alone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	steady	gaze	traveled	from	her	eyes	to	her	nose,	mouth	and	back.	It	went through	her.	“I	can’t	do	that,”	he	said	softly.	“I’ve	never	forgotten	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	heart	beat	in	syncopated	rhythm	like	a	wild	tarantella.	“Too	late…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	arguing	now,”	he	replied.	“Go	back	on	stage,	finish	the	rehearsal.	You know	I	love	kids.	Maybe	Bobby	and	I	will	sing	along.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	sing.	‘Row,	row,	row	the	boat…’”	The	boy	wasted	no	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>It	was	Doug’s	laugh	that	grabbed	her	bruised	heart.	His	personable,	warm laughter,	his	easy	way	with	her	nephew.	He	glanced	at	her	and	winked.	“Another ham	in	the	family.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">This </i>	was	the	Doug	she	remembered.	Sweet.	Funny.	It	would	be	so	easy	to	pick up	where	they’d	left	off.	So	easy	to	pretend	the	last	five	years	hadn’t	happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Too	easy.	In	less	than	twenty-four	hours,	he’d	managed	to	reawaken	something in	her.	A	yearning,	perhaps,	that	she’d	refused	to	recognize.	A	yearning	she’d allowed	no	one	else	to	satisfy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Too	bad	she	didn’t	trust	him	to	stick	around.	For	a	beginning	playwright,	New York	was	the	place	to	be.	Too	bad	also,	that	she	needed	her	family	as	much	as they	needed	her.	Her	brothers	and	sisters	leaned	on	each	other.	They	were	tight, and	she	wasn’t	leaving	them.	She	sighed	deeply.	Nothing	was	simple. </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">They	left	the	theater	together,	and	Doug	apologized	for	needing	to	take	off.	“The house-hunt	is	on.	So	you	live	nearby,	huh?	The	Downtown,	area?	Maybe	I’ll look	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	can	afford	it.	You	should	probably	get	a	roommate	or	find	a neighborhood	further	away.	In	fact,	you	can	even	go	back	to	New	York!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	kidding?	After	I	juggled	a	million	balls	to	arrange	this	year	at	BU	and the	theater?	Besides,	I	can’t	make	the	single	habit	too	easy	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The-the—what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	reaching	for	the	gold	ring,	Jen.	Remember	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	mouth	covered	hers,	his	kiss	a	surprise	that	felt	so	familiar,	yet	so	new. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Different.	Her	pulse	raced,	and	she	leaned	in,	enjoying	the	familiar	sensation	of his	lips	on	hers,	the	familiar	fragrance	of	his	after-shave	lotion	before	pulling back,	flustered.	“No,	no.	I-I	can’t	go	through	this	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Neither	can	I,	Jen.”	His	voice	sounded	hoarse.	“So,	I’m	taking	a	chance	here,	a chance	on	a	different	ending.”	He	kissed	her	again,	this	time	a	quick	good-bye, and	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>His	words	lingered	in	her	mind—his	words	and	her	memories—as	she	made	her way	with	Bobby	toward	Boston	Common.	Doug	took	risks	all	the	time.	He	was	a talented	writer—she’d	known	that	years	ago—but	how	many	writers,	even brilliant	ones,	really	earned	a	living?	Anyone	who	believed	that	love	paid	the bills	was	a	fool.	Now	where	had	that	thought	come	from?	She’d	never	been curious	about	the	financial	side	of	him.	She’d	only	noticed	the	talent	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	was	he	really	doing	back	in	Beantown?	That	kiss…tears	started	to	run down	her	face.	“Damn,	damn,	damn…and	just	when	I	had	it	all	figured	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	and	Bobby	watched	the	swan	boats,	played	catch,	and	ran	after	the	football. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	called	Lisa	for	a	medical	update	on	her	and	her	new	daughter	and	was relieved	at	her	sister’s	calm	words.	The	afternoon	turned	to	early	evening	by	the time	Jen	returned	Bobby	to	his	dad—a	dad	they	found	sound	asleep	on	the	living room	couch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shh…”	warned	Jen	with	a	finger	on	her	lips.	“Just	give	a	gentle	hug.	Let	him sleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dad-dy!!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mike	rolled	over,	grabbed	his	son,	and	bestowed	dozens	of	kisses	on	the	boy’s neck	and	belly.	Giggles	ensued	before	the	man	stood,	child	in	his	arms,	and looked	at	Jennifer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks	for	taking	him,	Jenny.	After	two	bad	experiences,	I	don’t	think	Lisa	will ever	agree	to	another	nanny.	My	folks	are	driving	in	tomorrow,	but	you	have been	a	lifesaver.	Don’t	know	what	we’d	do	without	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	shrugged.	“No	worries,	Mike.	I’m	not	going	anywhere.	Families	take	care	of each	other,	don’t	they?	Just	like	you	and	Lisa	took	care	of	us.”	The	past	seemed to	haunt	her	today,	and	unexpectedly,	her	lips	began	to	tremble.	Pressing	them hard	together,	she	tried	to	divert	Mike.	“Uh	—	tell	me	all	about	the	baby.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	grabbed	the	bait,	and	for	the	next	five	minutes,	she	heard	all	about	the perfect,	but	miniature	Brianna	Grace	Brennan.	“I	swear,	she’s	no	bigger	than	a football.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	run	to	the	hospital	for	a	quick	visit	and	then	head	home,”	she	said.	“You okay	with	Bobby?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>“Of	course.	Right,	son?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	high-fived	each	other.	“I	played	ball	with	a	big	man	today.	Auntie	Jen	was singing,	and	I	played.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mike’s	quizzical	gaze	found	her,	and	Jen	sighed.	“Okay.	Emily	would	have mentioned	it	anyway.”	She	looked	him	in	the	eye.	“Doug	Collins	moved	back—</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’s	teaching	at	BU	and	putting	on	a	play	at	the	Commonwealth—	and	the	first thing	he	did	was	track	me	down,	and	I	don’t	know	how	I	feel	about	it	because I’m	afraid…I’m	afraid….”	She	felt	tears	well	and	pushed	them	away.	“I’m	afraid to	get	involved	again,	and	that’s	all	I	know	for	now.	I’m	an	idiot	for	even	talking to	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stepped	toward	the	hallway.	Mike’s	voice	followed	her.	“I	used	to	like	the guy.	But	not	at	your	expense.	Want	me	to	pay	him	a	visit?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	God,	no!”	she	replied,	twirling	toward	him	again.	“I’m	a	big	girl	now, Mike.	I’ll	handle	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sometimes,	honey,	an	interception’s	in	order.	At	other	times,	getting	to	the	end zone	simply	takes	a	lot	of	running	plays,	a	lot	of	zig-zagging.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	inhaled.	“I	get	it.	But	you	can’t	reach	the	end	zone	if	you	don’t	trust	your players.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	4</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	signed	a	one-year	lease	for	a	studio	apartment	on	Devonshire	Street,	in	the downtown	area	of	the	city.	It	might	or	might	not	be	near	Jennifer’s	place—he had	no	idea	exactly	where	she	lived	but	was	content	with	his	choice.	Not	far from	both	the	theater	and	university. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	Sunday	morning,	Evie	had	stopped	by	as	he	unloaded	his	clothes,	computer and	books	from	his	car,	making	several	trips	inside	with	his	arms	full.	It	was good	to	have	his	own	place	again,	and	even	though	his	sister’s	hug	had	felt extra-strong	a	little	while	ago,	he	was	sure	she	felt	the	same.	In	her	scrubs	and white	jacket,	she’d	looked	every	inch	a	physician. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	folks	are	very	proud	of	you,	Eve.	I	can	just	hear	Dad	saying	‘my	daughter, the	doctor.’”	His	grin	was	warm	with	his	own	pride. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shrugged.	“I	suppose.	But	I	just	wish—”	She	shook	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Forget	it,	Evie.	He’s	not	going	to	boast	about	his	son,	the	writer.	Been	there, done	that,	with	our	parental	units.	I’m	over	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you’re	so	smart.	Your	work	is	so	good.	A	full-length	play	and	a	one-act	on Broadway,	and	now	you’re	here	with	something	new	to	work	on.	I	just	don’t understand	them,	and	I’m	sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wrapped	his	younger	sister	in	his	arms.	“It	doesn’t	matter.	Writing	is	who	I am.	Sometimes,	getting	it	exactly	right	drives	me	nuts,	but…	in	the	end,	I	love it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	smile	reassured	him.	“I	love	my	work	too,”	Eve	said.	“Not	so	crazy	about the	hours,	though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	the	love	part	that	counts	more.	Trust	me.	If	you’re	going	to	spend	your whole	life	doing	something,	be	sure	it	makes	you	happy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	advice,	Doug.	I’m	so	glad	you’re	back.”	She	gave	him	a	quick	kiss	and left	for	the	hospital. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>He	could	have	done	worse	than	having	Eve	as	a	sister.	They’d	forged	a	better relationship	since	they’d	grown	up	and	moved	away	from	home.	He	hung	up	the last	of	his	shirts	and	ran	down	the	two	flights	to	the	ground	floor,	out	the	front door	of	the	building	and	smack	into	Jennifer	Delaney. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow.	How	lucky	can	one	man	get?	Do	you	actually	live	in	this	building?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	not	 <i class="calibre4">that </i>	lucky,	kiddo.	I’m	up	about	two	blocks,	but	you’ve	got	a	great coffee	shop	on	your	corner.”	She	held	up	her	large	to-go	cup	and	continued	to walk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	time	for	a	friend?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	got	a	busy	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will	every	day	be	too	busy	for	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	stopped	her.	She	turned	slowly	toward	him,	her	brow	furrowed,	eyes shadowed.	“There	is	no	‘us’	anymore.	You	were	gone	for	a	long	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	a	five-year	residency,	Jen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded.	“Five	years	in	two	separate	worlds.	I	know	circumstances	were lousy,	but	life	went	on,	and	we	owe	each	other	nothing.	Couples	break	up	every day.	Let’s	say	we	each	had	a	clean	slate	after	the	visits	stopped	and	phone	calls became	fewer.	A	clean	slate	after	you	were	gone	for	a	while. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Figured	it	all	out,	huh?	As	easy	as	that.”	He	snapped	his	fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	say	it	was	easy,”	she	protested.	“But	I’m	not	going	backward.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	could	live	with	that.	But	she’d	given	him	an	opening	that	he	wasn’t	going	to ignore.	“Then	how	about	starting	over?	As	you	said,	the	slate’s	clean.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whew!	If	he	weren’t	so	sincere—and	cute—at	the	same	time.	If	his	eyes	didn’t implore,	if	he	didn’t	sound	as	though	the	future	of	civilization	depended	on	her response….	And	his	mouth—she	loved	his	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>“My	imagination	isn’t	as	good	as	yours.	I	can’t	simply	forget	the	past.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	put	it	in	a	box	on	a	high	closet	shelf	out	of	the	way.	Examine	it	from	time to	time	if	you	have	to,	but	don’t	let	it	be	a	barricade	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	a	picture.	“I	keep	forgetting…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Forgetting	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“…how	good	you	are	with	words.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Normally,	I’d	say	thanks.	But	somehow,	I’m	not	taking	that	as	a	compliment right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	building	was	just	ahead,	and	she	glanced	at	her	watch.	“I	want	to	visit	Lisa and	the	baby.	Then	hit	the	books.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Going	for	an	MBA?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Already	have	it.	But	I’ve	got	in-house	training	this	week	and	want	to	be prepared.	My	career	means	a	lot	to	me,	and	I	don’t	want	to	screw	it	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyes	shone,	and	a	grin	appeared.	“Henny-Penny,	I’ve	always	had	full confidence	in	you	and	still	do.	You	are	one	smart	lady,	and	I’m	sure	you’ll	be fully	prepared.’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Startled,	she	stepped	back.	“Thanks,	I	guess.	But	I	don’t	take	anything	for granted.	I’ve	worked	hard.	Frankly,	I’m	terrified	of	failing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	heard	his	“whoa,”	and	then	silence	settled	around	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Terrified	is	a	strong	word,”	said	Doug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	true	word.	I	want	to	make	my	parents	proud	of	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think,”	Doug	said	slowly,	“that	might	be	overkill.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?”	she	asked,	her	voice	rising	in	defense.	“Because	they’re	gone?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	at	all.”	He	stepped	closer	and	framed	her	face	in	his	hands.	“I’m	twenty-eight	years	old	and	have	two	shows	running	in	New	York	at	the	same	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>That’s	rare—very	rare—and	my	folks	could	care	less.	So,	what	does	their approval	mean	in	the	end?	Nothing.	You	go	after	your	dreams	because	inside, you	know	it’s	the	right	path.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	like	numbers,”	she	whispered.	“Always	have.	And	that	liking	morphed	into	a dream	career	with	a	world-renowned	investment	firm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know.	And	numbers	give	me	a	rash.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled.	He’d	always	been	able	to	make	her	laugh.	Seemed	he	still	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	maybe	that	was	not	a	small	thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	what	gave	me	a	rash	in	the	old	days?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course,	I	do.	Writing	those	personal	essays.	The	insult	of	revealing	your thoughts	and	feelings	to	a	bunch	of	strangers.	I’ll	never	forget	the	fire	in	your eyes	when	you	stalked	toward	that	door,	ready	to	quit	the	class.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	needed	those	three	credits	to	get	my	degree.”	Her	voice	fell	away	as	the memory	played	as	sharply	as	if	it	had	happened	yesterday.	“The	essays	were	all submitted	anonymously.	The	prof	picked	you	to	read	mine.	And	when	I	reached the	door—my	hand	was	on	the	knob—	you	said	I	couldn’t	leave,	that	the	course was	required	for	graduation.	Smarty-pants.”	But	a	shard	of	pain	still	stung inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe…just	maybe,”	Doug	slowly	began,	“it	was	too	soon	for	you	to	take	that writing	course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stared	at	him	then,	examining	his	features,	discerning	a	softness,	a compassion	that	she	hadn’t	noticed	then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	knows?”	she	replied,	her	voice	low.	“That	shrink	all	us	kids	visited	after the	accident	wanted	us	to	write	in	a	diary.	A	private	journal…”	She	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	class	lasted	for	one	semester—the	longest	ever	fifteen	weeks	in	college—</p>
<p class="calibre1">but	in	the	end,	I	handled	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	watched	him	pull	out	his	phone.	“You	handled	that	and	a	lot	of	other	things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,	can	you	handle	giving	me	your	cell	number?	Or	will	I	have	to	call	you	at work	and	interrupt	you	again	and	again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a> <i class="calibre4">“Fools	rush	in…” </i>	she	sang	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	head	jerked	up.	“You	won’t	be	sorry,	Jenny.	We’ll	take	it	slow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	it	was	the	only	way	to	discover	once	and	for	all	what	it	was	about	this man	that	put	other	men	in	the	shade.	She’d	spent	five	years	keeping	busier	than ten	people	so	as	not	to	miss	him.  <i class="calibre4">I	Will	Survive. </i>	As	the	song	had	reminded	her Friday	night,	she	had	a	lot	of	love	to	give.	If	Doug	had	frozen	her	heart,	then maybe	he	was	the	right	one	to	melt	it	again	or	at	least	help	her	reach	a	closure that	worked.	A	final	closure.	So	she’d	be	able	to	move	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	the	speed,”	she	whispered.	“It’s	the	uncertainty.	The	trust.”	She extended	her	hand.	“Give	me	your	phone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">Trust	was	a	big	one.  <i class="calibre4">The	only	one. </i>	Doug	couldn’t	get	the	word	out	of	his	mind all	day	as	he	finished	setting	up	his	apartment,	made	and	answered	phone	calls, and	once	more	studied	the	script	for	 <i class="calibre4">The	Sanctuary. </i>	Jen	had	a	trust	problem with	him.	Of	course,	she	was	wrong.	He’d	never	hurt	her.	Never.	In	time,	she’d understand	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back	in	the	theater	on	Monday	morning,	Doug	greeted	the	play’s	producer,	who had	many	projects	behind	him,	and	the	young	director,	who’d	already	made	a name	for	herself	locally.	They	wore	big	smiles,	and	exuded	high	energy	and anticipation.	A	great	way	to	start. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	thrilled	that	you’ve	decided	to	stage	this	in	Boston,”	said	Lynn,	as	she shook	Doug’s	hand	and	sat	down.	She	glanced	at	her	cohort.	“We	both	are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	won’t	be	sorry,”	added	Jake.	“Our	theater	group	has	won	many	awards	due to	our	high-quality	performances,	provided,	I	might	add,	at	a	fair	price.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Two	excellent	attributes	for	a	successful	playhouse,”	said	Doug	with	a	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Since	I’m	on	staff	at	the	university	this	year,	I’d	say	it	all	worked	out.”	He	held up	his	well-worn	script.	“Can	we	get	down	to	business	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instantly,	the	conversation	ceased,	and	the	analysis	began.	Doug	noted	that	each of	the	others’	manuscripts	looked	as	dog-eared	as	his.	Theater	was	a	risky business,	and	no	one	wanted	to	fail. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>Three	hours	went	by	before	Doug’s	stomach	growled.	He	looked	at	his	watch and	pushed	his	chair	back.	“I’m	starving.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	he	felt	Lynn’s	hand	on	his	arm.	“Before	we	break,	I	just	want	to	say	how much	I	love	this	play.	I	love	each	character.	And	I	love	the	title.  <i class="calibre4">The	Sanctuary. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	perfect.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,”	said	Doug.	“It’s	funny	how	sometimes	a	title	comes	hard,	but	this one…?	It	whispered	to	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	winner	all	around,”	confirmed	Jake.	“The	way	I	see	it,	our	mission	is	to cast	it	properly	here,	have	a	good	run,	and	then	you	can	bring	it	to	New	York.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug’s	stomach	tightened.	“Let’s	take	one	step	at	a	time.”	Sure,	Broadway	was the	goal,	but	as	he’d	told	Jen,	he’d	just	be	a	consultant	and	commute	to	New York	as	needed.	“We’ll	see	what	happens.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	watched	the	other	two	exchange	a	quizzical	glance.	“We’ll	see?”	asked	Lynn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	no	‘we’ll	see’	about	it.	This	is	a	powerful	story.	It	deserves	to	be	on Broadway!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	cocked	his	head	and	smiled	appreciatively.	“Nice	to	have	a	fan	club,	but let’s	just	say,	I’m	paying	it	forward.	My	first	play,  <i class="calibre4">The	Broken	Circle, </i>	was produced	here	when	I	was	a	lowly	undergrad,	and	now	it’s	doing	well	in	New York.”	He	shook	his	head.	“Sometimes	I	can	hardly	believe	it	myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	his	success	had	come	with	a	price.	A	vision	of	Jen	filled	his	mind—Jen	in	all her	moods	–	thoughtful,	with	a	crinkle	in	her	brow,	happy,	with	a	wide,	beautiful smile,	loving,	with	a	warmth	in	her	eyes	and	gentle	hands	caressing	his	cheek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	turned	his	world	upside	down	because	of	her,	always	knew	he	would	after he’d	tied	up	his	loose	ends	in	New	York.	Their	story	was	not	yet	finished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">So	much	for	giving	him	my	cell	number. </i>	At	ten	that	evening,	after	a	full	day	of client	meetings	followed	by	the	training	seminar,	Jen	yawned	and	prepared	for bed.	She	hadn’t	heard	from	Doug	all	day,	and	the	flash	of	disappointment	she felt	annoyed	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	just	then	she	heard	the	whoosh	of	a	text	signal.	She	glanced	at	her	phone	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>felt	herself	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">R	U	up? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Big	day.	Just	about	to	go	to	bed. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Not	yet. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	phone	rang.	“So	how	did	your	busy	day	go?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hang	on.	I	want	to	get	comfortable.”	She	leaned	back	against	her	pillows before	replying.	“Actually,	my	day	went	very	well	both	personally	and professionally.	Lisa’s	home,	and	if	all	goes	well,	baby	Brianna	should	be	home in	a	few	days.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	really	great.	A	load	off	your	mind—off	everyone’s	mind—knowing	how close	your	family	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	last	sentence	echoed	the	past.	“Nothing’s	changed	about	that,	Doug.”	Her voice	hardened.	“The	Delaney-Brennan	clan	is	tight.	Always	will	be.	So,	if	that’s still	a	problem	for	you…?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Holy	Toledo,	Jen!	Take	a	breath.	Cool	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	waited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	spoke	again,	his	tone	calm.	“Of	course,	I	know	your	family’s	tight.	And	I know	you	all	had	to	be	in	order	to	survive.	Okay?	And	now,	you’re	all	grown	up, living	a	grown-up	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Still	in	Boston.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	heard	his	laugh.	“So	you	are.	And	here	I	am,	back	here,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	muscles	relaxed	one	by	one,	like	a	balloon	slowly	deflating.	“I	guess	so.	At least,	you	seem	to	be—for	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Count	on	it,	Jenny.	I’m	not	going	anywhere.	Now,	tell	me	about	your	great	day in	the	office.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Okay,	he	was	trying.	“Lots	of	training	with	more	to	come.	All	part	of	growing</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>my	career.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what	do	you	actually	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	paused,	wondered	if	he’d	get	it.	“Simply	put,	I	help	clients	plan	for	their financial	future.	You	know—the	usual.	Investment	guidance,	retirement planning,	income	strategies,	wealth	management	and	even	college	planning.	I’ve got	my	Series	7	and	63	as	well	as	my	insurance	licenses.	I	love	doing	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	low	whistle	came	through	the	line.	“All	that	from	the	girl	who	computed	the family	budget	and	told	her	big	sister	how	much	to	spend?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lisa	couldn’t	even	balance	a	checkbook	back	then.	I	figured	it	out	at	sixteen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	why	do	you	remember	that	little	factoid?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Henny-Penny,	there	isn’t	anything	about	you	that	I	don’t	remember.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	breath	caught.	“Sounds	scary.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope.	Sounds	like	I’m	getting	your	attention.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Time	to	change	the	subject.	“And	how	was	 <i class="calibre4">your </i>	day?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Want	the	good	news	first,	or	the	bad	news?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bad	news?	Already?	You	just	started.	I	swear,	a	career	like	yours	would	give me	hives.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	the	stock	market	doesn’t	go	up	and	down?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	plan	for	that.	We	plan	for	all	the	contingencies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	quiet	laughter	came	through	the	phone.	“What	a	big	word!	Contingencies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sounds	to	me	that	it’s	more	about	control.	Sweetheart,	no	matter	how	hard	you work,	you	can’t	control	the	world.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	sure	as	shootin’	can	control	 <i class="calibre4">my </i>	world.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	way	she	said	it,	so	seriously,	as	if	she	truly	had	total	power,	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>amused	him	as	he	said	goodnight.	Her	tender	spot.	Her	world	had	exploded years	ago	but	would	never	do	so	again—if	Jen	had	anything	to	say	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	his	phone	rang,	he	saw	Jen’s	name	and	answered	quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anything	wrong?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	talked	about	 <i class="calibre4">my </i>	job,	but	you	didn’t	tell	me	about	your	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	soft	and	sexy	voice.	No	wonder	she	was	a	natural	jazz	singer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	right.	So…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	news	first,”	she	interrupted.	“Let	me	enjoy	it	before	problems	rear	their nasty	heads.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	your	problems	to	solve,	kiddo.	I’ve	got	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence	met	his	ear.	“Jen?	Still	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Y-e-s.”	She	sounded	unsure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	thinking.	You’re	right.	I	don’t	have	to	solve	your	problems.	You’re	an	adult now,	too.	With	one	show	on	Broadway,	and	one	off-Broadway,	you	must	be earning	a	living.	So,	tell	me	the	good	news.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	producer	and	director	for	 <i class="calibre4">The	Sanctuary </i>	love	the	script,	which	means they’ll	go	to	hell	and	back	to	do	it	right.	Tomorrow,	we’re	holding	our	first auditions	for	the	main	characters.	It’s	an	exciting	time.	And	I’m	betting	on Boston	not	to	let	me	down.”	She’d	never	understand	the	chance	he	was	taking	by leaving	New	York. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	won’t.	Just	like	when	 <i class="calibre4">The	Broken	Circle </i>	was	put	on	in	school.	It	was—	was like	magic.	You	almost	cried.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	were	supposed	to	forget	about	that!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nah.	I	could	see	you	were	overwhelmed.	Awestruck	to	see	your	printed	words brought	to	life.”	She	paused,	and	he	waited.	“Doug?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>“Yeah?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it	still	like	that?	Still	awesome?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Every.	Single.	Time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	spoke	softly	then.	So	softly,	he	strained	to	hear	her.	“Then	I	guess	you	made the	right	choice	five	years	ago…and	for	the	right	reasons.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	couldn’t	breathe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	so	did	I,”	she	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	5</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	hard	to	put	Doug	out	of	her	mind,	to	pretend	he	wasn’t	back	in	town.	That idea	was	totally	unrealistic	now.	After	a	restless	night,	however,	Jen	went	to work	the	next	day	determined	to	keep	a	friendly	distance.	Doug	could	be	one	of her	guy	friends.	Like	Evan	or	Matt.	She	and	Doug	had	both	found	what	they’d been	seeking.	They’d	put	their	educations	to	good	use.	He	loved	his	work,	she loved	hers.	Correct	choices.	Case	closed.	The	past	was	in	the	past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within	five	minutes	at	work,	she	was	fully	engrossed—personal	appointments, customer	calls,	and	her	own	seminar	that	afternoon.	At	quitting	time,	she grabbed	her	purse	and	realized	she’d	gotten	through	the	day	without	thinking about	Doug	too	much,	if	she	didn’t	count	every	in-between	moment.	He	was someone	she	used	to	know…as	the	song	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	cell	rang	at	ten	o’clock	that	evening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	was	your	day?”	came	the	familiar	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Busy.	As	is	the	rest	of	my	week.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ouch.	Sending	me	a	message?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Was	she?	“I’m…figuring	that	out	myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take	all	the	time	you	need.	I’m	not	going	anywhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	seemed	to	be	his	theme.	Time	to	focus	on	him.	“And	how	was	 <i class="calibre4">your </i>	day?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	day…well,	as	it	happens,	I	have	good	news	and	bad	news.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Again?	That	seems	to	be	your	daily	report.	I	do	not	like	bad	news,	not	anyone’s bad	news.”	Her	throat	began	closing,	her	voice	quiet.	Even	ten	years	later,	the words	instilled	fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jenny,	shh…not	to	worry.	It’s	professional,	not	personal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>Didn’t	matter.	Her	adrenaline	surged	anyway.	Bad	news	meant	all	her	senses	on alert.	“Okay,	I’m	ready.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	heard	from	my	agent	friend	today.	I’d	sent	him	a	novel	a	month	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	novel?	You	mean	a	regular	story—a	book—and	not	a	play?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	didn’t	like	it?	That’s	so	hard	to	believe.	You	come	up	with	such	powerful ideas…powerful	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	he	loved	the	storyline.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But…?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Said	it	should	have	been	a	play.	Seventy	percent	of	the	book	was	dialogue.	And the	other	thirty,	he	said,	sounded	like	I	was	bossing	everyone	around.	Sitting, standing,	shoving.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	started	to	laugh,	then	giggle.	“Huh!	Guess	that	big	playwriting	residency didn’t	make	much	of	an	impression	on	you.	The	first	time	you’re	on	your	own, you	choose	to	write	a	novel!	A	novel	that’s	really	a	play.	Too	funny,	Doug,	weird and	funny.	I	guess	you	are	who	you	are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	sighed	dramatically.	“I	think	you’re	right.	But	it	was	worth	the	effort	just	to hear	you	laugh.	Love	that	laugh.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Too	personal. </i>	“So	what	are	you	going	to	do	with	that	story	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t	it	obvious?	I’m	going	to	take	my	friend’s	advice	and	rewrite	it.	Writing	is rewriting	most	of	the	time	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With	your	other	jobs,	it	sounds	like	you’ll	be	busy	twenty-four	seven.	Maybe that’s	best	—	for	both	of	us.”	She	couldn’t	deny	the	feelings	he’d	reawakened	in her,	but	she	wasn’t	ready.	Time	and	space	suited	her.	“I’ll	say	goodnight	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	disconnected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	a	second	later	she	heard	a	ding.	A	text	from	the	failed	novelist.  <i class="calibre4">“Sorry	to</i> <i class="calibre4">spoil	your	plan,	Jenny.	On	my	To-Do	list,	you	are	Number	One.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>#</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Didn’t	Lisa	tell	you?”	asked	Mike	over	the	phone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	guess	not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Luis	is	picking	up	the	boys	at	the	airport	tomorrow	and	bringing	them	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’re	off	the	hook	for	once.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mike’s	driver	was	like	part	of	the	family,	but	not	usually	around	too	much	in	the off-season.	“Then	I’ll	meet	you	at	the	house,”	said	Jen.	“I	want	to	see	my brothers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	up	to	you.	But	you’re	screwing	up	a	Friday	night...uh…with	your friends.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	out.	Have	fun.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	when…?	“What’s	this	all	about?	I’m	with	my	friends	often	enough.	You’re talking	to	good	old	Jenny	here.	And	you	do	not	sound	like	good	old	Mike.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Big-brother	Mike	is	talking	now.	You	need	to	have	more	fun.	And	the	Brennan-Delaney	clan	is	not	going	to	screw	it	up	for	you	this	time	around.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sucked	back	both	her	tears	and	laughter.	Her	thoughts	swirled.	This	time around?	Could	they	know	the	real	reason	she	stayed	five	years	ago?	She’d	made a	strong	effort	hide	her	pain	and	confusion.	Even	Lisa	hadn’t	asked	too	many questions—just	accepted	that	Doug	needed	to	be	in	New	York.	And	maybe,	with all	that	was	happening	between	her	and	Mike	at	the	time,	she	preferred	Jen	at home,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you’re	all	my	family!”	Jen	protested.	“Nothing’s	more	important.	You’re doing	Lisa’s	dirty	work,	aren’t	you?	She’s	behind	this	ridiculous	conversation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	it’s	dirty	work,	then	we’re	both	involved—Lisa	and	I.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I-I	don’t	understand,	but	I’m	not	going	to	make	a	fuss	now.	You	guys	still	have a	full	house	to	handle,	including	an	itty-bitty	baby	and	a	three-year-old.”	She</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>thought	about	the	twins,	and	Emily’s	concert	on	Saturday,	plus	Lisa	and	Mike’s careers.	Lisa’s	legal	practice	needed	her	hands-on	involvement.	It	was	a	lot.	“If	it will	make	you	both	happier	to	think	I’m…socializing,	then	fine.	But	this conversation	is	not	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Agreed.	And	one	more	thing,	Jen.	Bring	Doug	to	visit	us	whenever	you	want.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug.  <i class="calibre4">Now </i>	she	clearly	understood	the	motivation	behind	this	discussion.	First up,	though,	she	needed	to	change	the	mood.	“You	and	Lisa	can	take	off	your	hair shirts,”	she	said.	“The	past	is	all	on	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">On	Friday	evening,	Jen	made	her	way	to	the	lobby	of	her	office	building	to	meet her	friends	and	spotted	Doug	among	them.	She	didn’t	recall	inviting	him,	but wasn’t	too	surprised.	He’d	felt	welcomed	the	week	before	and	“people-person” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	probably	assumed	he	was	now	part	of	the	group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	wide	smile	lit	up	his	face	when	she	approached,	and	she	felt	herself	smile back,	her	doubts	beginning	to	dissolve	as	she	was	drawn	to	his	warmth.	He hurried	toward	her	and	wasted	no	time	planting	a	kiss	on	her	mouth—as	though he	had	the	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Slow	down,	cowboy.	You’re	way	ahead	of	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	always	was…always	circled	back	to	let	you	catch	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Was	that	true?	“Tortoise	and	the	hare?”	she	joked.	She’d	think	about	the implications	later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Didn’t	matter,”	he	replied,	“since	we	were	heading	in	the	same	direction.”	He paused,	his	brown	eyes	darkening,	turning	solemn.	“It	seems	I’ve	circled	back again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	choice,”	she	whispered,	avoiding	his	gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	Jennifer!”	She	glanced	up	to	see	Alexis	and	Liz	waving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	lucky	save,”	said	Doug,	smiling	at	the	newcomers.	“Where’s	the	rest	of	the crew?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>“Evan’s	coming.”	said	Alexis,	“but	Matt	said	he’d	catch	up	at	Maguire’s.”	She turned	toward	Liz.	“Do	you	know	what’s	holding	him	up	on	a	Friday	night?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz	glanced	away.	“Just	working	late,	I	guess.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm…”	Jen	glanced	at	Alexis,	who	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	elevator	deposited	its	passengers.	“There’s	Evan.	Let’s	go.	I’m starving.”	Doug’s	stomach	growled	in	time	to	his	words.	“It	keeps	doing	that,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	joked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	you’re	always	starving,”	said	Jen.	She	sighed	dramatically.	“Whether it’s	poets,	playwrights,	writers.…starving	seems	to	be	the	keyword.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	rolled	his	eyes	and	opened	the	outside	door.	“Spare	me,	will	ya’?	In	fact,	I had	a	terrific	day.”	He	grinned	at	them.	“The	auditions	were	great,	and	we’re	all cast.	Full	reading	starts	Monday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hear,	hear!	I’m	impressed,”	said	Evan.	“Maybe	I	pegged	you	wrong.	That’s quite	an	achievement	in	one	week.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure	was	fast.	You	really	are	the	hare,”	commented	Jen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	you	business	types	always	say	‘time	is	money?’	”	asked	Doug.	“We’ve got	the	main	stage	booked	for	the	second	weekend	of	September	and	for	eight weekends	thereafter,	plus	Wednesdays.	We’d	better	be	ready.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	wait	to	see	it,”	said	Alexis.	“I’ve	never	known	a	real	playwright.	Or	any writer,	in	fact.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’d	arrived	at	Maguire’s	as	Liz	said,	“Let’s	make	it	a	party.	An	opening-night party.	All	of	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	see,”	said	Jen.	Four	months	from	then	seemed	like	an	eternity.	Who	knew what	her	relationship	with	Doug	would	be?	She	glanced	at	him	and	received	a wink.	“You’ll	be	there,”	he	whispered,	“and	I	hope	you’ll	be	cheering.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	make	promises	I	may	not	keep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	heard	his	deep	inhale	and	exhale.	“Maybe	you’re	right.	Let’s	find	out.”	He</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>leaned	forward,	his	arms	around	her,	and	placed	his	mouth	on	hers.	Gentle	at first,	then	pressing	harder,	and	she	opened	to	him,	her	tongue	meeting	his.	Her eyes	closed,	her	breath	disappeared	as	she	absorbed	his	familiar	touch,	his familiar	fragrance.	Comforting,	secure…exciting.	A	frisson	of	happiness	raced through	her	as	time	disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	friends	cheered,	and	reality	brought	her	up	short. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	man…”	she	turned	aside,	her	face	on	fire.	Public	displays	of	affection	were definitely	not	her	style. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	asking	for	promises,”	said	Doug,	keeping	her	close.	“Take	your	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	his	grin	belied	his	words.	He	leaned	closer	and	whispered,	“Nothing	has changed	since	our	undergrad	days.	You’re	still	the	one.	And	so	am	I.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	that’s	supposed	to	make	me	happy?”	she	whispered,	glad	to	see	Evan pointing	at	a	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“C’mon,	lovebirds,”	the	man	said,	leading	the	way.	“The	crowd’s	lighter	than last	week.	I	guess	people	are	grabbing	weekends	at	the	Cape	already.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lovebirds?	She’d	have	to	straighten	Evan	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	love	a	place	on	Cape	Cod,”	said	Alexis.	“The	beach,	the	ocean…	Work hard,	play	hard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	sat	quietly,	her	mind	flashing	to	the	large	beach	house	Mike	had	bought several	years	ago	for	the	family	to	enjoy.	Their	summer	neighbors	had	come	to accept	him	as	just	another	resident,	regardless	of	the	three	Super	Bowls	he’d	led the	Riders	to	win.	But	as	usual,	she	didn’t	share	details	of	her	home	life,	even with	these	closest	friends.	Her	family’s	past	experiences	with	paparazzi	and	their invasive	techniques	precluded	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	here’s	Matt,”	exclaimed	Liz,	her	body	poised	to	stand—or	fly.	Jen	eyed Alexis	and	nodded	toward	their	friend.	Alexis	shook	her	head	and	seemed confused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Matt	approached,	but	his	gaze	was	only	for	Liz.	“It’s	what	we	thought.”	He turned	to	include	the	table.	“I’ve	got	some	news,”	he	began.	“I’m	being promoted.”	He	held	up	his	hand	to	stop	Jen	as	she	began	to	congratulate	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>“All	those	late-night	courses	seemed	to	have	paid	off.	However,	there’s	a	kink.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	from	one	to	the	other.	“The	new	position	requires	me	to	relocate	to	a regional	office.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alexis	was	the	first.	“Congratulations…I	think.	But	we’ll	miss	you,	Matt.	Oh, I’m	not	ready	for	this.	I	wasn’t	expecting	my	little	working	world	to	fall	apart.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	think	this—”	Evan	gestured	around	the	table	“—could	last	forever?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I-I	guess	I	never	thought	about	it,”	said	Alexis.	“But	why	not?	The	Boston office	is	huge.	It’s	the	corporate	headquarters.	I	thought	we’d	all	be	together	for years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	did	I,”	admitted	Jen,	blinking	quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	remained	silent,	but	Jen	sensed	him	staring	at	her	and	her	co-workers, taking	it	all	in.	Fodder	for	another	play? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	exactly	where	are	you	going,	Matt?”	she	asked	softly.	“Maybe	just	to	Rhode Island?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Matt	cleared	his	throat.	“Actually,	I’ll	be	further	away	than	that—in	Kentucky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Working	at	the	office	in	Covington.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	far!”	Jen	cried,	her	stomach	twisting.	“That’s	a	real	goodbye.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Haven’t	you	heard	of	planes?”	joked	Evan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	the	same,”	she	protested.	“Nothing	ever	stays	the	same.”	She	heard	the	cry in	her	own	voice	and	pressed	her	lips	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jenny—look	at	me,”	said	Doug,	gently	turning	her	head.	“Think	of	it	not	as	a goodbye	but	as	a	hello—for	Matt.	New	challenges,	building	his	career.	That’s what	you	all	want,	isn’t	it?	And	sometimes	moving	is	what’s	required.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wasn’t	talking	only	about	Matt.	He	was	speaking	about	them.	About	their past	when	moving	to	New	York	City	was	out	of	the	question—for	her.	It	still was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz’s	quiet	voice	broke	in.	“He	won’t	be	going	alone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>All	eyes	turned	to	her.	“We’re	going	together.	Hopefully,	I’ll	work	something	out with	the	company.	If	not,	I’ll	go	job	hunting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Matt	stood	behind	Liz,	his	hands	resting	on	her	shoulders.	He	leaned	over	and kissed	her	on	the	cheek	before	addressing	the	group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	would	have	figured	this	out	soon,	but	Lizzy	and	I—we’ve	been	seeing	each other	away	from	the	office	for	almost	a	year	now….And,	well…we’re	taking	the relationship	to	the	next	level.”	He	smiled.	“More	news	to	follow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	toast	to	your	new	adventure,”	said	Doug,	raising	his	water	glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	Of-of	course,”	said	Jen,	pasting	a	smile	on	her	face	while	in	the	back	of her	mind,	Carol	King	asked	if	anybody	stayed	in	one	place	anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	bringing	the	baby	home	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	sat	on	the	side	of	her	bed	the	next	morning,	her	sister’s	words	floating	above her	as	she	held	her	phone	and	tried	to	wake	up.	The	message,	when	received,	had her	bolting	from	the	pillow.	“That’s	wonderful.	I	can’t	wait	to	see	her	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Neither	can	I.	But	I	need	a	favor.	Instead	of	meeting	us,	can	you	accompany Emily	to	Symphony	Hall	tonight?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emily’s	concert.	A	very	big	deal.	“Of	course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I…I	feel	awful	not	going	with	her,	but	Brianna	needs	me,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	certainly	does!	Don’t	think	twice	about	it.	Emily	can	even	stay	overnight	at my	place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,	but	she’ll	probably	want	to	come	home.	She’s	funny	that	way.	Can’t wait	to	get	to	school,	but—and	this	worries	me—she’s	happiest	when	she’s	alone and	practicing	her	violin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing	new	there.	“Lis—she’s	just	being	herself.	And	she’s	so	good	with	that fiddle.	Practicing	is	a	one-person	job.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>“I	know,	I	know.	But	I’m	not	sure.	Heck,	I’m	not	sure	of	anything.	Maybe	my hormones	are	out	of	whack	now.	Sometimes	I	wonder	if	Emily	still	thinks	Mom can	hear	her	in	heaven?	Is	that	why	she’s	relentless	with	her	playing?	She’s	not seven	years	old	anymore!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Goosebumps	popped	up	on	Jen’s	skin.	“She	can’t	believe	that	now.”	A kaleidoscope	of	family	memories	invaded	her	mind,	finally	bringing	her	to	the prior	night’s	conversation	at	Maguire’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	we’re	all	carrying	around	a	piece	of	the	past,”	she	said	softly.	“You,	me, Em,	our	brothers.	Maybe	it	doesn’t	go	away,	and	we	just	deal	with	it	the	best	we can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	long,	low	whistle	came	through	the	phone.	“Quite	the	philosopher	so	early	in the	morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	chuckled.	“I	try.”	But	did	she?	For	the	first	time	in	a	long	time,	she	wasn’t sure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mike	and	I	don’t	worry	about	you	anymore.	You	figured	out	what	you	wanted and	never	looked	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe,	where	Doug	was	concerned.	“Thanks,	but	it	was	a	no-brainer.	Finance and	I	are	a	natural	fit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	I	know	it!	Oh…Bobby’s	calling	me.	See	you	later.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	natural	fit,	Jen	thought,	as	she	disconnected.	For	the	first	time	in	her	adult	life, she	wondered	if	her	career	was	enough.	Her	family?	Friends?	Her	choral	group? </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’d	never	questioned	her	choices.	But	since	Doug	had	reappeared	only	a	week ago,	he’d	turned	her	life	into	one	big	question	mark. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	6</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Friday	night	with	Jen	and	her	friends	wasn’t	enough.	His	nightly	phone	calls	to her	were	good,	but	not	good	enough	either.	He	wanted	more.	He	needed	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	Saturday	morning,	Doug	started	a	small	pot	of	coffee	and	glanced	at	his calendar.	Every	box	was	filling	up.	The	new	play	required	not	only	rehearsals but	meetings	with	Jake	about	publicity	and	community	sponsors.	He	had	to prepare	for	the	new	semester	at	BU.	He	had	ideas	for	his	advanced	students	that he	wanted	to	implement	himself.	And	of	course,	a	revision	to	 <i class="calibre4">Straight	from	the</i> <i class="calibre4">Heart. </i>	All	important	goals,	but	not	more	important	than	his	first	priority:	Jen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	poured	the	coffee	into	his	mug	and	sipped.	He	wanted	to	build	his relationship	with	her.	Built	it	slowly,	with	trust.	Court	her!	He	smiled,	first,	at	his old-fashioned	word	choice,	and	second,	because	he	realized	that	“courting”	was essentially	what	the	hero	of	his	novel	had	decided	to	do	while	searching	for	his ending.	Not	too	surprising	when	he’d	based	the	heroine	on	Jen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Picking	up	his	cell,	he	pressed	her	number. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	Doug.	I’m	just	out	of	the	shower.	Can	I	call	you	back?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shower?	Images	of	a	glorious,	naked	Jen	bombarded	him,	with	her	long	legs, soft	breasts—but	he	bit	his	tongue.	“Absolutely.	I’ll	be…ah…waiting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Dreaming. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">But	just	as	Friday	nights	and	nightly	calls	weren’t	enough,	dreaming	wasn’t enough	either.	He	answered	the	phone	on	the	first	ring.	“It’s	Saturday,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	spend	the	day	together.	Wherever	you	want	to	go.	Whatever	you	want	to do.	I	can	pick	you	up	in	thirty	minutes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence.	Then,	“I’m	sorry,	Doug.	The	twins	are	back,	and	Emily’s	got	her	concert tonight.	Little	Brianna’s	coming	home	today	too.	I’m	really	busy…and—and…</p>
<p class="calibre1">well	you	know	the	routine	with	my	family.	Everything’s	happening	at	once.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	take	you	and	Emily	to	the	concert	tonight,”	he	responded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	haven’t	heard	anything	I	just	said.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>“I’m	ignoring	it.	While	I’d	really	like	to	spend	the	entire	day	with	you,	I’m	also trying	to	show	some	understanding.	Don’t	I	get	points	for	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	heard	a	reluctant	laugh	and	smiled.	Humor.	Humor	always	worked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’d	need	a	ticket	for	tonight.	The	concert’s	at	Symphony	Hall,	a	really	big deal,	and	Emily…well,	she	might	be	as	highly	strung	as	her	violin.	Uh…that’s	a family	joke…sort	of.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very	funny.	I’m	glad	you	shared	it.	And	don’t	be	sorry	when	you	realize	what you	said.”	Sharing	a	 <i class="calibre4">family </i>	joke	was	a	good	sign—almost	like	in	the	old	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sorry	already.	See	you	at	five	o’clock.	At	the	house.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	be	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	hung	up	and	wanted	to	cheer.	Better	than	sharing	that	joke,	she’d	just	invited him	to	her	most	precious	place.	A	place	he	hadn’t	entered	in	five	years.	Her family’s	home.	That	was	the	upside.	The	downside?	How	would	he	be	received? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shrugging,	he	searched	for	the	Symphony	Hall	website.	He	couldn’t	control	how Jen’s	siblings	felt	about	him	reappearing,	but	he	could	buy	a	last-minute	ticket	to Emily’s	concert. </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	immediately	spotted	the	limousine	as	he	approached	the	house	on	Beacon Street.	He	shouldn’t	have	been	surprised.	Mike	Brennan	would	make	sure Emily’s	special	night	was	special	in	all	ways.	And	safe,	too.	He	had	to	admit	the guy	had	taken	on	a	load	of	responsibility	when	he’d	married	his	wife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	had	liked	the	man	when	they’d	first	met.	After	learning	Doug	was	a	writer, Mike	had	extended	his	hand,	saying	“Welcome	to	my	world,	Doug,	where	you either	have	what	it	takes	or	you	don’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks.	I	intend	to	make	my	own	kind	of	touchdowns.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	recalled	that	conversation	and	stood	a	little	taller	as	he	approached	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever	his	reception,	Jen	was	worth	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>The	door	swung	wide	before	he	could	knock.	And	there	stood	Jennifer	Grace Delaney.	Stunning.	Long	sparkly	earrings,	a	black	dress	that	hugged	her	figure and	strappy,	high-heeled	sandals.	The	woman	had	legs.	Did	she	ever.	He	took	it all	in	with	a	glance	and	then	focused	on	her	eyes.	Her	violet	eyes	shone,	then darkened	as	she	looked	up	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	clean	up	pretty	well,	Doug….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	reservations	melted	as	he	burst	into	laughter.	“Glad	you	approve.	I	did	learn a	little	something	in	New	York.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	come	in,	come	in.”	She	stepped	back,	and	he	walked	into	familiar territory—with	a	twist.	No	one	matched	his	memories	in	the	small	crowd	that had	gathered.	Two	identical-looking	young	men	approached	him,	same	blonde hair,	green	eyes,	same	walk	and	body	movement.	Dressed	up	for	a	night	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	no	way	I	can	distinguish	between	you	two,”	Doug	said,	extending	his hand.	“But	it’s	amazing	to	see	the	grown-up	version	of	the	boys	I	once	knew.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	not	done	growing	yet,	I	hope,”	said	one,	his	voice	light.	“I’m	Brian.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	we’re	old	enough	now	to	figure	things	out.”	This	brother’s	tone	was	more serious.	“I’m	Andy.	And,	if	you	haven’t	noticed,	we’re	both	going	with	you	and Jen	to	the	concert.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	couldn’t	disappoint	Emily,”	added	his	brother,	with	a	meaningful	glance back	at	his	twin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	air	had	definitely	cooled.	He	had	walked	into	the	proverbial	lion’s	den. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	crying	out	loud,”	said	Jen.	“Cut	the	drama.	Doug’s	an	old	friend.	Just	a friend.	So	relax	and	focus	on	your	little	sister.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	we…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	were	sad…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	take	care	of	myself,	boys,”	said	Jen.	“Stick	to	baseball.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mike’s	not	liking…” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>She	turned	to	Doug	then.	“If	you	want	to	change	your	mind	about	going,	I’ll understand.	Maybe	there’s	such	a	thing	as	too	much	family!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wish	mine	were	more	like	yours.”	His	unplanned	response	surprised	him.	And must	have	surprised	Jen,	from	the	wide-eyed	look	on	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	never	knew	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	either.	Until	this	minute.	But	I	have	a	great	sister.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	flashed	a	warm	smile.	“I	remember.	Sisters	are	the	best.	And	speaking	of…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded	toward	the	hallway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emily	appeared.	White	blouse,	long	black	skirt.	Violin	case	in	her	hand.	“We need	to	go,”	she	said	quietly.	“Lisa	and	Mike	are	with	the	baby.	And	Bobby won’t	leave	their	side.	So	let’s	just	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	the	boss	tonight,”	said	Jen,	her	arm	going	around	the	girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	always	think	Mozart	is	my	boss	or	Mendelson	but	then…when	I	play,	I	think maybe	it’s	me	who’s	the	boss.	You	know,	it’s	complicated.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	caught	the	questioning	look	passing	between	the	brothers.	“The	limo’s outside,”	he	said	quickly.	“Are	you	ready,	Jen?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded.	“C’mon,	everyone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Luis	stood	by	the	car	and	waved	them	in.	“Now	we’ve	got	the	whole	family back.	Mr.	Brennan	likes	summertime	the	best.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	do	I,”	said	Jen,	as	she	entered	the	car	after	Emily.	“Even	if	my	bros	drive	me a	bit	crazy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Doug	could	see	the	love	for	them	in	her	laughing	eyes	as	she	teased.	A	good big	sister,	and	he’d	bet	the	boys	counted	on	her.	Or	took	her	for	granted.	He	was in	no	position	to	ask	questions,	but	maybe	he	could	do	a	good	turn	for	Jen’s	little sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	Emily,	you	got	me	thinking	about	what	you	said	about	Mozart.	I	feel	like that	too.	Sometimes,	I	get	lost	in	my	writing.	Sometimes,	I	don’t	know	where	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>words	come	from.	Is	Mozart	your	boss?	Or	does	his	music	carry	you	away,	until you’re	lost	and	just	play	it	from	your	heart?	You’re	right	about	it	being complicated—especially	when	you’re	really	talented	like	you—but	it’s	also	very satisfying.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	said	Emily.	“It	just	feels…good!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mike’s	his	own	boss,”	said	Brian.	“And	the	team	leader.	He	keeps	practicing until	he’s	better	than	anyone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	loves	the	game,”	said	Andy	slowly.	“In	all	ways—heart,	mind	and	body.	He calls	the	plays,	but	he’s	also	part	of	the	team.	When	you	think	about	it, everything	really	is	complicated.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even	Mike	can’t	play	such	a	tough	game	forever,”	said	Emily	slowly.	“But	I want	to	make	music	forever.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	quiet	for	the	few	more	minutes	it	took	Luis	to	reach	their	destination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	car	slowed	to	a	stop,	Doug	looked	out	the	window.	“We’re	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow,	I	didn’t	have	time	to	be	nervous,”	said	Emily,	“until	right	now.	Good conversation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Luis	opened	the	door	and	they	scrambled	out,	each	thanking	the	man.	Emily	led the	way.	“I	have	to	use	the	side	door,	but	I’ll	see	you	later.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	luck.”	Jen	hugged	her.	“We	love	you	no	matter	what.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	just	don’t	throw	up,”	said	Brian. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	you	used	to,”	added	Andy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	rolled	her	eyes.	“They	never	forget	anything!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	we	theater-people	say,”	said	Doug,	“break	a	leg.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emily	grinned	and	disappeared	into	the	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whew,”	said	Jen.	“We	did	it.	It	took	all	of	us,	but	we	did	it.”	She	glanced	at him.	“Thanks	for	distracting	her	with	that	conversation.”	Then	she	gathered	her</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>brothers,	one	on	each	arm.	“Love	having	you	both	back	from	school.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	saw	it	on	her	face,	heard	it	in	her	voice.	When	she	loved,	she	loved	hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	he	wanted	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stared	at	him	then,	head	tilted,	eyes	bright.	“Now,	do	you	understand?”	she asked	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	do	understand.	And	if	that	was	the	whole	point	of	today’s	visit,	then	you’ve wasted	your	time.	I’m	not	in	competition	with	your	family.	But	you	have	to figure	that	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">After	the	concert,	Luis	took	Emily	and	the	twins	home,	and	dropped	Jen	and Doug	downtown.	As	they	started	walking	toward	their	apartments,	Jen	found	her hand	resting	in	Doug’s,	as	though	it	were	the	most	natural	place	to	be.	Had	Doug been	right	earlier?	Had	she	wanted	him	to	see	how	close	her	family	was	so…so she	didn’t	have	to	feel	guilty	about	the	past	anymore?  <i class="calibre4">Oh,	yeah,	Jen.	Still	trying</i> <i class="calibre4">to	prove	you	were	right? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Emily	was	amazing,	wasn’t	she?”	Jen	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	say.	Standing-ovation	kind	of	amazing.	I	had	no	idea	she’d	be	a	featured player.	A	major	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	going	to	Tanglewood	in	a	couple	of	weeks,”	Jen	said,	“the	summer	home of	the	Boston	Symphony.	She	might	be	the	youngest	there,	only	eighteen	and playing	with	the	best.	She	used	to	spend	summers	at	a	music	camp	run	by	Itzhak Perlman	and	his	wife.	She	had	to	audition	to	get	accepted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug’s	long,	low	whistle	reassured	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tanglewood’s	across	the	state,”	she	said,	“and	I’ll	probably	drive	her.	Emily doesn’t	have	a	license	yet—it’s	never	even	come	up	in	conversation!”	She	shook her	head	and	sighed.	“I	swear	she	lives	in	the	clouds.	The	girl	needs	a	keeper! </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	can’t	see	Mike	leaving	Lisa	and	the	kids	to	chauffeur	her.	And	Luis	has	a vacation	planned.	So,	I’ll	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Want	company?	I	grew	up	nearby	and	know	exactly	where	it	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>She	needed	to	think.	“Will	you	turn	it	into	a	family	visit	as	well?”	Funny	that she’d	never	met	his	parents	during	their	four	years	of	undergrad	school.	They lived	far	away,	and	she	hadn’t	thought	too	much	about	it	then.	But	now	she wondered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably	not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Axe	murderers?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	laughed,	his	eyes	gleaming.	“Not	quite	that	bad,	but	not	up	to	your	standards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or	mine,	either,	for	that	matter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stopped	walking.	“My	standards?	I’d	never	judge	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	yes,	you	would,	but	it	doesn’t	matter.”	He	faced	her	then,	took	her	head gently	between	his	hands.	“<i class="calibre4">They </i>	don’t	matter.	This	is	about	you	and	me.	Not	the extra	players	on	the	set.	Because	in	the	end,	when	you	go	to	sleep	at	night,	only one	person	will	be	sharing	your	pillow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	breath	caught	on	the	truth	of	his	words.	Only	one	person…or,	it	seemed,	no one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	leaned	over	and	touched	his	mouth	to	her	lips.	One	touch,	and	whatever	fire she’d	tamped	down	through	the	years	blazed	again.	She	kissed	him	with	a hunger	that	surprised	her.	Stunned	her.	But	filled	her	with	well-being. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	embrace	tightened.	“Jen?”	He	pointed	at	her	building.	“You	know	how	I	feel about	you,	but	it’s	your	call.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">My	call. </i>	Only	a	man	who	cared	for	her—perhaps	really	loved	her—would	toss that	ball	into	her	court.	Living	in	limbo	had	to	end.	It	seemed	she’d	put	her	life on	hold	for	five	long	years.	“Maybe	I’ve	been	waiting…all	this	time,”	she whispered,	as	she	took	his	hand	and	led	him	inside.	Together,	they	ran	up	the	one flight	to	her	door.	And	to	her	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	right	decision.	Afterward,	amid	the	tossed	blankets	and	clothes,	amid	the renewed	and	new	knowledge	of	one	another,	Jen	cuddled	next	to	him,	one	arm around	his	waist	while	his	lay	around	hers.	“So	glad	you	came	back,”	she</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>murmured,	“home	to	Boston,	home	to	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Home,”	he	sighed.	“A	simple	word	that’s	sometimes	not	so	simple.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	now.	You’re	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	grinned.	“I	am.	And	maybe	my	love	story	has	found	its	ending	after	all,”	he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	new	play	I’m	working	on.	The	ending	hasn’t	been	clear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Surprised,	she	tipped	her	head	to	see	him	better.	“I	thought	you	had	to	know	the ending	before	starting	the	first	page.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	remember	me	saying	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I-I	remember	too	many	things….”	His	quick	smile,	the	lick	of	hair	he	brushed from	his	forehead,	the	spicy	fragrance	of	his	aftershave…the	study	sessions	at school.	And	singing	together	one	Christmas	in	her	hometown.	Doug	had mentioned	it	weeks	ago.	That	memory	had	stayed	with	them	both. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	brushed	a	kiss	on	her	temple.	“You	sound	sad	and	I’m	sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	twisted	positions	so	she	could	see	him.	Slowly,	she	stroked	his	cheek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doug…I’m	happy	you’re	here.	Don’t	doubt	it	for	a	moment.	But	we	need	to	go slowly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	grinned.	“I	think	it’s	a	little	late	for	‘slow.’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	waved	her	hand	at	the	room	and	down	at	the	bed.	“You	and	I…?	We	have	a history,	and	this—this	is	only	one	part	of	it.	We	were	happy	then,	and	it’s	easy	to fall	into	old	ways.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	were	simply	interrupted,	Jen,	but	I	hear	you.	If	you	want	slow,	then	okay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	are	you	doing	tomorrow	night?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed.	“That’s	your	idea	of	slow?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>“Weekends	don’t	count.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	Doug.	It’s	all	so	familiar,	and	yet	so	new.	I	need	to	get	to	know	you	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	haven’t	changed.	Still	ambitious,	still	love	what	I	do.	And	still…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	read	the	unspoken	thought	in	his	eyes.	Eyes	that	shone	with	love	for	her.	She squeezed	his	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	thing	is…I	need	to	know	not	only	you,	but	myself	a	little	better,	too.	How can	I	give	my	heart	if	I	don’t	know	what’s	in	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	heard	him	draw	in	a	deep	breath	and	let	it	out	slowly.	“Maybe,”	he	began, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“you’ve	been	spending	too	much	time	taking	care	of	everyone	else	and	forgotten about	yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	week	ago,	she	would	have	protested.	She	would	have	argued	loudly.	Tonight, she	let	his	words	sink	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	7</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">A	new	beginning	with	Doug.	She	wanted	it	and	she	wanted	it	to	be	right	this time.	But	too	much	introspection	always	made	her	nervous.	Those	diary	entries she	was	forced	to	make,	and	that	shrink	they’d	gone	to…all	good	for	the	others, but	none	of	it	did	a	thing	for	her.	She’d	just	gone	through	the	motions	and	coped by	keeping	herself	busy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	now.	She	extended	her	hand	to	her	first	clients	of	the	day,	a	couple	about her	parents’	age	when	they’d	died,	and	prepared	to	assist	them,	explain	options and	help	them	plan	for	a	secure	financial	future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	siblings	and	she	had	inherited	nothing	after	the	accident.	Just	a	house	with	a mortgage.	Not	even	a	car.	Tough	when	the	supermarket	was	two	miles	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa	had	dropped	out	of	law	school	and	gotten	a	teaching	job	as	a	way	to	earn	a salary,	while	Jen	worked	out	a	budget.	And	six	months	later,	Mike	and	Lisa	had married.	For	all	their	sakes.	God,	why	was	she	thinking	about	this	now? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	talk	about	your	goals,”	she	began,	“and	the	type	of	investments	you’re comfortable	with.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	too	much	risk,”	said	the	woman.	“Someday	one	of	us	will	be	alone,	and	we don’t	want	to	be	dependent	on	anyone,	especially	not	on	our	kids.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	had	been	dependent.	Sixteen	years	old	and	caught	in	a	whirlwind	of uncertainty.	Her	friends	couldn’t	handle	it	and	had	stopped	coming	by.	She’d wanted	to	run	away…had	a	plan	to	emancipate	herself.	But	Lisa	and	Mike	had stopped	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	understand	exactly	what	you	mean,”	said	Jen.	“Financial	planning	means security.	It’s	not	greed.	It’s	just	smart.	And	I’d	never	want	to	be	dependent	on anyone,	either.”	Never	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	you	really	do	understand.	Did	we	give	you	our	children’s	names	as beneficiaries?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	you	did,”	said	Jen,	scanning	her	computer	screen.	“As	well	as	their	socials. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>You’re	good	parents.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	folks	hadn’t	left	a	will.	They’d	had	a	small	life	insurance	policy	that	didn’t go	far.	Jen	winced,	annoyed	at	herself.	Her	folks	had	been	wonderful	in	every other	way.	They’d	left	a	legacy	of	music	and	laughter,	of	warmth	and	love.	She blinked	hard	and	forced	her	thoughts	back	to	the	computer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	time	her	clients	left	her	office,	Jen	was	smiling.	She’d	done	a	good	job counseling	the	couple.	They	seemed	much	more	relaxed	than	when	they’d arrived,	confident	with	their	decisions.	Just	as	important,	however,	she’d returned	to	being	Jen,	the	consummate	professional. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thinking	about	the	past	caused	emotional	upheavals	that	wore	her	out.	But	what was	that	old	saying?  <i class="calibre4">An	unexamined	life	was	not	worth	living. </i>	She	supposed there	was	some	truth	to	that,	but	she’d	had	enough	self-examination	for	a	while. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	she	was	off	to	a	rehearsal	for	the	community	concert	coming	up	next Saturday.	With	a	light	heart,	she	made	her	way	to	the	Commonwealth	Theater, where	she	might	run	into	Doug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	night	of	her	concert,	Jen	looked	out	at	the	audience	and	quickly	spotted her	“people”	in	the	second	row.	Every	member	of	her	family	had	come,	even Lisa,	who’d	said	she	needed	an	outing	in	the	real	world.	Baby	Brianna	and	her big	brother	were	safely	at	home	with	Mike’s	doting	parents.	Her	brothers	came willingly,	knowing	they	were	headed	out	the	next	day	to	Cape	Cod	for	their summer	baseball	teams	and	jobs.	As	for	Doug	—	she	peered	into	the	darkening theater	toward	the	back,	where	he	was	able	to	buy	one	of	the	few	remaining tickets.	Someone	was	waving	madly	out	there.	She	giggled.	Now,	she	conceded that	 <i class="calibre4">all </i>	her	people	were	in	attendance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	notion,	as	it	popped	into	her	head,	made	her	realize	that	Doug’s	place	in	her life	had	become	ever	more	important.	She	supposed	he	was	as	unforgettable	as the	song	of	the	same	name	she’d	be	singing	that	night,	an	unexpected	second solo	due	to	illness	of	the	original	singer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	caught	the	eye	of	her	 <i class="calibre4">Unforgettable </i>	partner	backstage.	“Are	we	good	to go?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a>“I	should	be	asking	you	that	question.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	smiled.	“I’m	all	set.	The	show	must	go	on,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	there	was	no	more	time	for	chit-chat.	Jen	made	her	way	to	the	risers and	took	her	place.	Excited	for	sure.	But…happy	as	well.	She	stood	taller	and felt	more	carefree	than	she	had	in	a	long	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	focused	on	the	director,	joined	in	the	beginning	medley	of	standards	and knew	the	chorus	had	come	through	when	she	heard	the	initial	applause.	Duets, trios,	and	solos	followed.	She	breathed	deeply	as	her	cue	for	“Summertime” </p>
<p class="calibre1">drew	closer.	And	then	she	was	in	the	spotlight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	familiar	melody	slid	from	her	diaphragm,	and	as	she	continued,	she	felt herself	smile,	totally	enjoying	and	losing	herself	in	the	words.	She	riffed	on	the melody,	improvising	and	feeling	free,	as	though	she	were	the	one	in	the	song spreading	her	wings,	flying	away.	The	musicians	followed	her,	and	unlike	a karaoke	number,	the	music	they	made	together	was	rare	and	so	personal—so Jen!	She	reveled	in	it	until	the	end…when	it	became	too	personal.	The	words weren’t	true	for	her.	Some	things	had	harmed	her.	Her	dad	and	mom	could	not stand	by.	They	were	gone	when	she’d	still	needed	them.	Even	though	she’d	sung this	lyric	many	times,	tonight,	emotion	choked	her	and	her	voice	broke.	Her heart	broke…again,	while	tears	ran	down	her	cheeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thunder	assaulted	her	ears.	Confused,	she	carefully	turned	her	head	to	the	left, then	to	the	right,	and	then,	second	by	slow	second,	returned	to	reality.	The audience	was	on	their	feet.	Clapping,	whistling,	and	shouting	 <i class="calibre4">bravo,	bravo. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa	and	Emily	were	crying.	She	scanned	for	Doug	and	spotted	him	jogging down	the	aisle	right	to	the	stage.	In	his	hand,	a	small	bouquet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	supposed	to	be	for	later,	but	timing	is	everything.	No	more	tears,	Henny-Penny.	Take	another	bow.	You’re	a	hit!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guy	always	managed	to	make	her	laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	were	great,	sis.	Just	great.	We’re	proud	of	you,”	said	Andy.	“It	was	an <i class="calibre4">unforgettable </i>	performance!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>“Very	pun-ny.	But	very	nice	to	hear	from	a	younger	brother.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	glad	we	came,”	added	Brian.	“Timing	was	close	since	we’re	heading	out tomorrow.”	His	grin	said	it	all,	and	Jen	knew	his	mind	was	already	on	the pitcher’s	mound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,	boys.	I’ve	enjoyed	my	fifteen	minutes	of	fame,	but	now	reality	awaits.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	walked	hand	in	hand	with	Doug	outside	the	theater	as	their	group	looked	for Luis	and	the	car.	“Actually,	guys,	I	think	I’m	supposed	to	drive	you	to	Hyannis tomorrow	for	your	summer	league.	With	all	the	rehearsals	and	night	classes,	I’m a	bit	confused.	But	I’m	ready	to	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can	sleep	late,”	said	Brian.	“Mike	bought	us	a	car.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	what?”	Jen	exclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	an	almost-new	second-hand	Pilot,”	said	Andy,	“so	there’s	room	for	our stuff.”	He	patted	her	arm.	“The	gas	is	on	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Totally	baffled,	Jen	turned	to	her	brother-in-law.	“I	could	have	driven	them…</p>
<p class="calibre1">why	did—”	Mike	had	done	so	much	for	them	already.	Regardless	of	his	income, enough	was	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Both	you	and	Lisa	have	busy	lives.	Neither	of	you	can	go	and	fetch	them	every time	they	want	to	come	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	would	have…”	she	began	to	protest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	right,	Jen.”	Doug’s	quiet	voice	caught	her	attention.	“Your	brothers	are	old enough	to	be	responsible	for	a	car.	With	the	baseball	scholarships	they	just	told me	about,	and	the	attention	they’ll	get	from	the	scouts,	who	knows	where	they’ll end	up?	They’ll	need	a	car	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	took	a	breath	before	saying,	“I	know	where	they’ll	end	up.	They’re	staying right	here	in	Boston.	They’ll	play	for	the	Red	Sox!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	boys	cheered.	Lisa	laughed.	Doug	said,	“Hear,	hear!”	The	tension	was	cut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	that’s	not	the	way	it	works,”	said	Mike,	the	only	one	who’d	been	through	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>professional	draft	experience.	“And	there’s	no	use	speculating.	The	only	rule	in this	family	is	that	our	kids	graduate	first.	And	that’s	not	debatable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Definitely,”	said	Jen	quickly.	“Can’t	take	a	chance	on	being	sidelined	with	a broken	arm	or	something	worse.”	Like	never	getting	drafted	by	any	team. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	her	degree,	she’d	be	nowhere.	Their	hardworking	parents	had	pushed education,	had	wanted	a	better	life	for	their	kids.	And	then	Mike,	the	boys’	legal guardian,	had	picked	up	where	her	folks	had	left	off.	He	was	determined	her brothers	understand	the	importance	of	backup	plans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Besides,”	said	Mike,	throwing	his	arm	around	Andy,	“they’re	not	ready	to	go pro.	They	need	a	little	more	meat	on	their	bones.	Eat,	boys,	eat!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	glanced	at	Doug.	“You	were	skinny	at	their	age,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Live	in	the	present,	Henny-Penny.	Can’t	call	me	skinny	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	her	there.	“Not	going	to	argue.	I	guess	time	has	a	way	of	changing things.”	She	looked	at	the	ones	she	loved,	her	personal	crowd—and	the	truth	of her	statement	slammed	into	her	like	a	runaway	train. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	God,”	she	said,	suddenly	shivering.	“Our	lives	really	are	changing.	I	don’t like	it!”	She	took	a	deep	breath,	her	gaze	slowly	moving	from	one	beloved person	to	the	other.	“I	can’t	stop	any	of	you	from	growing	up	and	branching	out, but	one	thing	must	not	change.	We	will	always	be	the	Delaneys!	The	Delaney-Brennan	clan.	We	stick	together	no	matter	what,	because	if	we	don’t,	we	might disappear	like…like”—she	waved	her	fingers—"ashes	in	the	wind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Promise	me.”	she	added,	her	voice	cracking.	Her	chin	dropped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence	followed,	broken	in	a	moment	by	a	cacophony	of	voices.	Familiar, reassuring	voices.	Mike’s	protective	tone,	her	brothers’	tentative	expressions, Lisa’s	sympathetic	hugs.	But	only	one	voice	registered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	it	go,	Jen.	Let	the	damn	fear	go!”	Doug	leaned	in,	his	forehead	touching hers.	“Your	family’s	not	going	anywhere,	and	they	don’t	need	a	babysitter.	Not anymore.	Now,	it’s	your	turn.	Do	what	the	song	said	and	spread	your	wings.	It’s time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>Maybe	Doug	was	right,	in	theory.	Not	in	reality.	Not	a	babysitter,	but	a	coach? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	week	later,	Jen	sat	behind	the	wheel	of	Mike’s	car,	heading	west	on	the	Mass Pike	toward	the	Tanglewood	Music	Center	in	Lennox.	She	darted	a	glance	at Doug,	who	sat	next	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Emily’s	awfully	quiet	back	there,”	she	whispered.	“Will	you	take	a	look?	A subtle	look.	She’s	sensitive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,”	said	Doug,	twisting	in	his	seat.	“Hey,	Emily.	What’s	going	on	in	that head	of	yours?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Geez.	I	said	subtle!”	said	Jen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can	probably	tell	what’s	going	on,”	said	Emily.	“I’m	an	open	book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everybody	can	read	me.	I	wish…I	wish	I	was	stronger,	like	you,	Jen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	Emmy.	I’ve	got	my	own	issues…as	Doug	likes	to	remind	me.	But	you? </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’re	terrific.	Just	consider	how	you’re	spending	this	summer!	You’ve	earned	a fantastic	opportunity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	mean	by	my	audition?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	the	recommendations	from	your	teachers,	and	getting	all	the	paperwork	in on	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“…and	convincing	Mike	to	let	me	out	of	his	sight	for	the	summer	with	no	adult supervision.	I	guess	I’m	an	adult” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	a	bit	overprotective	is	our	big	brother.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	always	says	if	my	head	weren’t	attached	to	my	shoulders,	I’d	forget	where	I put	it.	And	he	may	be	right.	Like..uh…right	now.	Jen,	I	forgot	my	money!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	Typical.	Which	was	why	Jen	was	still	Lisa’s	deputy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	forgot	the	credit	gift	card	Mike	gave	me	to	use	at	Tanglewood.	It’s	on	my	desk at	home.	It	was	for	lunches	and	other	‘incidentals’	that	aren’t	included	in	the program.	He	said	the	safest	thing	to	do	is	use	a	gift	card.	I	think	it	was	for	five hundred	dollars.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>Great.	She	had	only	twenty	dollars	in	her	wallet.	Her	mind	raced	for	solutions, but	Doug’s	laughter	interrupted	her	thoughts.	She	glared.	“What’s	so	funny?	Do you	want	her	to	starve?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	watching	you	think,”	he	replied	with	a	grin.	“You’re	very	expressive	when problem-solving.”	He	turned	to	look	at	Emily.	“Not	to	worry,	honey.	Your	sister has	a	knack	for	rescuing	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	come	on.	This	one’s	actually	a	no-brainer.	Even	you	could	figure	it	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	waved	her	fingers	at	her	sister.	“We’ll	just	stop	at	an	ATM,	and	I’ll	withdraw enough	from	my	account	to	keep	you	going	for	a	week.	There’s	no	way, however,	that	I’m	giving	you	five	hundred	in	cash.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emily	sighed	a	big	sigh.	“I	don’t	blame	you.	I’d	probably	lose	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Amazing	how	you	never	lose	your	violin,”	said	Doug,	a	meaningful	note	in	his voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doug!	I’d	never,	ever	do	that.”	Emily’s	indignation	now	had	both	Doug	and	Jen laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	believe	you.	Just	teasing,”	said	Doug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But…you	know…money	will	be	an	issue	real	soon.	Do	I	have	any	money	of my	own,	Jenny?	You	know,	like	from	Mom	and	Dad?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">If	only. </i>	“I’m	sorry,	sweetie.	I	thought	you	already	knew	that	from	when	we discussed	it	with	the	boys.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	Lisa	and	Mike	pay	for	everything?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	sure	do.	Before	I	started	my	career,	I	had	some	scholarship	money,	and	I worked	part-time	in	school,”	said	Jen.	“But	Lisa	and	Mike	provided	our	home and	food	and	clothing.	So	why	are	you	asking	all	these	questions	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	violin	thing.	I’ll	figure	it	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen’s	mind	filled	with	possibilities.	“Do	not	ask	Mike	to	fund	a	Stradivarius	or any	other	rare	instrument.	Hear	me,	Emily?	Do	not.	Enough	is	enough!	And that’s	way	beyond	a	normal	expense.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>“I	might	not	be-be	worthy	of	one	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	want	to	be?”	asked	Doug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“More	than	anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	you’ll	get	there.	First,	however,	make	the	most	of	the	summer.	You’ll	be with	true	professionals,	and	they’ll	have	some	good	advice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	wait	to	see	Maestro	Perlman	again,”	said	Emily,	addressing	Doug directly.	“He	really	wanted	me	to	go	to	Julliard	in	New	York,	where	he	teaches master	classes,”	she	told	him,	shaking	her	head.	“But	I	was	too	scared	to	leave Boston.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence	resonated	for	a	moment.	“Sounds	awfully	familiar…”	The	deep	voice next	to	Jen	offered	thoughtfully.	“Staying	home	seems	to	run	in	your	family.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	had	lots	of	options,	Em,”	said	Jen.	“But	The	New	England	Conservatory	is a	fabulous	school,	too.	You’re	not	being	cheated.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Maestro	said	the	same	thing	when	I	told	him	at	music	camp	last	summer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	understands	me,	and	he	said	when	I	was	ready	to	fly,	I	should	let	him	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	a	feeling,”	said	Doug	slowly,	“that	when	the	time	comes,	your	violin issue	will	take	care	of	itself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doug’s	probably	right.	And	I’m	beginning	to	feel	like	the	most	ordinary	person in	this	car!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bit	of	levity	lightened	the	mood,	but	Jen	continued	to	think	about	her	sister’s dream.	The	“violin	issue”	wouldn’t	take	care	of	itself.	Nothing	ever	resolved itself,	except	a	common	cold.	She	had	to	come	up	with	a	future	plan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	sister	is	going	to	have	a	fabulous	summer,”	said	Doug	as	he	and	Jen headed	back	to	the	car	after	waving	goodbye	to	Emily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	so,	too.	At	least	she	can’t	complain	about	the	campus.	Hundreds	of	acres surrounded	by	scenery	an	artist	would	paint.	I	just	hope	it’s	everything	she</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>dreamed	it	would	be.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dreams	take	a	lot	of	work.	And	sometimes,	as	the	song	tells	us,	we	get	what	we need	instead	of	what	we	want.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	suppose.	But	none	of	us	are	willing	to	settle…at	least	not	yet.	And	that includes	you!”	Jen	took	out	the	car	keys	and	offered	them	to	Doug.	“Feel	like driving?	Suddenly,	I’m	wiped.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	took	the	keys	and	kissed	her.	“Sometimes	being	a	big	sister	is	hard	work.	I don’t	think	I	gave	Eve	an	ounce	of	concern	compared	to	how	you	guys	act. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Guess	I	wasn’t	a	great	big	brother.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	beat	yourself	up.	From	what	you’ve	told	me,	you	were	trying	to	cope with	some	family	dynamics	yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	may	have	a	point,”	he	said,	kissing	her	again.	This	time	she	blushed,	and his	heart	filled.	“Let’s	go.	Maybe,	just	maybe,	it’s	time	to	reevaluate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	her	hand	on	the	door,	she	tilted	her	head	back	to	see	him.	“What	do	you mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Want	to	take	a	little	detour	to	chez	Collins?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	eyes	widened,	a	grin	started.	“Wouldn’t	miss	it	for	the	world.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	headed	east	and	left	the	Mass	Pike	at	the	next	exit.	Doug	had	no expectations,	but	felt	his	stomach	tighten.	Despite	his	protestations	to	the contrary,	was	it	possible	he	still	sought	approval	from	the	people	who	should have	been	his	natural	cheerleaders?	He’d	thought	he	was	beyond	caring	about his	folks’	opinions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	might	not	even	be	home,”	he	muttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	massaged	his	shoulder.	Sweet.	“It’ll	be	fine,”	she	said.	“Either	they’ll confirm	your	beliefs,	or	you’ll	have	a	happy	surprise.	Regardless,	you	won’t have	to	wonder	anymore.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">True.	“I	love	your	analysis,”	he	said,	“realistic	with	a	hint	of	optimism.	And	I hope	you	still	feel	that	way	if	this	is	a	total	bust.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>And	there	was	the	crux.	He	wanted	Jen	to	know	the	good,	the	bad	and	the	ugly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	been	honest	in	all	other	ways—school,	career,	relocation—but	somehow, his	family	had	remained	hidden.	He	reached	for	her	hand,	and	she	tucked	it	into his. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	time	around,”	he	began,	“I	want	everything	in	the	open.	Maybe	you’ve never	given	my	family	a	second	thought.	But	I’m	in	deep	with	you,	Jen,	and	now I	want	no	secrets.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	pulled	her	hand	away.	“I	hear	you,	believe	you,	but	Doug…I’m	not	quite ready.	You’re	moving	too	fast.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	breath	caught;	his	thoughts	spun.	Jen’s	mind	continued	to	rule	her	heart.	Fear still	nipped	at	her,	and	she	clung	to	a	safety	zone.	In	total	contradiction	to	when he	held	her	in	his	arms.	In	her	bed,	she’d	received	him	lovingly,	with	heart	and soul.	He	breathed	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take	all	the	time	you	want,	Henny-Penny.	I’m	not	going	anywhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	drove	down	one	of	the	town’s	main	streets,	turned	right	for	several	blocks and	approached	the	neighborhood	of	one-story,	wood-sided	homes	where	he grew	up.	He	gazed	at	the	familiar	setting.	As	usual,	some	front	lawns	were	well-tended,	uniformly	green	and	trimmed;	others	needed	weeding.	And	yet	other homes	needed	a	paint	job. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	all	seems	both	familiar	and	strange,”	he	said.	“I	know	every	street,	but basically,	I	feel	like	an	outsider,	evaluating	the	area	like	a	Realtor	would.	And yet,	I	lived	here	for	eighteen	years.	A	long	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	felt	Jen’s	hand	on	his	thigh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	feel	the	same	way	about	Woodhaven.	It’s—it’s	a	place	I	used	to	know.	Mike’s parents	still	live	across	the	street	from	my	old	house.”	Her	voice	faded.	He pressed	her	hand	to	his	mouth	and	kissed	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wouldn’t	imagine	you	enjoy	visiting	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t,	but	I	also	don’t	like	to	disappoint	Aunt	Irene	and	Uncle	Bill,”	she	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>“the	senior	Brennans.	Fortunately,	we	celebrate	most	holidays	in	Boston.	Mike’s brother	lives	in	town,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.	That’ll	make	it	easier	going	forward.”	He	pulled	to	the	curb	a	block	from his	parents’	home	and	reached	for	his	cell	phone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	surprise	might	not	go	over	well,”	he	said	as	he	connected.	Then,	“Hey,	Dad…</p>
<p class="calibre1">Yeah,	it’s	Doug.	I’m	in	the	area	and	thought	I’d	stop	by…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“…Okay,	ten	minutes.	See	ya	then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	put	the	phone	down.	“My	mom’s	in	the	shower.	They’re	meeting	friends	for dinner,	so	this	will	be	a	quick	visit.	Better	that	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fair	enough,”	said	Jen.	“They	have	a	life,	too.	And	besides,	I’m	kind	of	hungry myself.	Lunch	seems	like	ages	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	cue,	her	stomach	rumbled.	They	eyed	each	other	and	burst	into	laughter	that seemed	to	last	forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	I	know	why	it’s	called	‘the	best	medicine,’”	said	Doug.	“You	can	meet	the parental	units	and	then	we’ll	have	a	nice	dinner.	Together.	Alone.	Don’t	even think	of	joining	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	actually	hadn’t,	but	now	that	you	mention	it…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	her	eyes	twinkled	and	her	grin	teased.	He	moved	toward	her	and	cupped	her face	with	his	hands.	“Come	here,”	he	whispered,	before	he	leaned	closer	and captured	her	mouth	with	his. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	response	was	everything	he	could	wish	for.	“Ah,	Jenny,	Jenny…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	slowly	pulled	back,	her	breaths	audible.	“Ah,	Dou-gie,	Dougie,	you’d	better drive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	ma’am,”	he	replied.	And	though	in	this	familiar	setting,	he	had	to	admit that	the	old	insecurities	and	disappointments	had	momentarily	reared	up	again, suddenly,	it	didn’t	matter	at	all	anymore	what	his	parents	thought	or	did	or	said about	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>##</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	she’s	a	pretty	one!”	said	Doug’s	father	as	he	opened	the	door.	“Maybe there’s	hope	for	you	yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	felt	her	smile	fade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dad!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eddie!”	came	a	woman’s	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?	What	did	I	say?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clueless.	The	big	man	looked	truly	confused,	and	Jen	didn’t	know	whether	to laugh	or	cry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	goodness	sakes,	Ed.	Where	are	your	manners?”	A	tall,	trim	woman	with curly	dark	hair	came	forward	and	offered	her	hand.	“I’m	Doug’s	mom,	Helen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	nice	to	meet	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Likewise,”	said	Jen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	turned	to	her	son.	“You	doing	okay?”	she	asked,	giving	him	a	hug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.”	She	patted	his	shoulder	and	led	them	into	the	living	room.	Jen	sat	on one	end	of	the	upholstered	sofa	with	Doug	next	to	her.	A	few	prints	hung	on	the walls.	“Doug	hasn’t	brought	any	friends	by	since…I	don’t	know,	maybe	since high	school.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	haven’t	lived	here	since	high	school!”	said	Doug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	true	enough,”	said	his	mom,	a	quick	smile	flashing	across	her	face	as	she sat	on	a	club	chair.	“But	just	in	case…I	keep	your	old	room	clean	and	ready. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eve’s	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug’s	mouth	opened	and	closed,	but	no	sound	came	forth.	He	looked	stunned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	poked	at	him.	“At	a	loss	for	words,	playwright?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>“I	never	know	what	to	expect,”	he	muttered.	Finally,	he	stopped	staring	at	his mom.	“You	can	finally	turn	the	room	into	that	craft	room	you	always	wanted.	Or a	library.	Or	a	home	office.	Mom…I’m	okay.	I’m	fine.	So,	redecorate	to	your heart’s	content.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	glanced	at	Doug’s	father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	earning	a	living?”	asked	the	man,	finally	sitting	down	near	his	wife.	“Tell me	you’re	earning	a	decent	paycheck	like	your	friends	here	do,	and	your	mother will	redecorate.	Their	folks	are	always	bragging.	I	know	more	about	their	kids than	about	my	own	son.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Doug’s	folks	are	nothing	like	mine	were.	Where’s	the	warmth?	The	atmosphere	is</i> <i class="calibre4">such	a	downer! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">His	dad	still	commanded	attention.	“Georgie’s	working	for	the	gas	company,	like his	dad	and	me.	Making	a	steady	paycheck.	And	Tommy	Belson	joined	the	air force,	and	that	wasn’t	an	easy	thing.	He’s	climbing	the	ranks.	And	who	was	that little	guy,	the	one	who	skied	like	the	wind?	Well,	he’s	part	of	the	Mt.	Snow operation—assistant	director	or	something	big.	All	good	boys.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	talking	about	Peter	Davis,”	said	Doug.	“The	best	skier	on	the	mountain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Glad	to	hear	he’s	doing	something	he	loves.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	making	a	living,”	said	Eddie.	He	glanced	at	Jen,	then	back	at	Doug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Parents	think	about	these	things.	Your	mother	worries	about	you.”	He	turned	to Helen.	“And	don’t	deny	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	bit	her	lip.	“Anyone	care	for	some	iced	tea?	Lemonade?	I’ve	got both	in	the	fridge.”	She	stood	and	faced	the	kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	don’t	want	to	detain	you,”	said	Jen,	starting	to	rise.	“Doug	said	you’ve	got	a dinner	date	with	friends.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	glanced	at	her	watch.	“We	can	postpone	for	ten	minutes.	I	want	to	visit with	my	son.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Point	for	Helen. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	sat	back	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>“Evie	told	us	you’d	bunked	in	with	her,”	said	Doug’s	father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	a	few	days,	until	I	found	my	own	place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ed	turned	to	Jen.	“My	daughter’s	an	intern	at	Mass	General.	Dr.	Eve	Collins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Won’t	have	to	think	twice	about	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	nodded.	“I	suppose	not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	happy,	Dad.	Working	hard	but	loving	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man’s	grin	lit	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	is	what	everyone	strives	for,”	added	Jen.	“Why	work	forty	hours	or more	a	week	at	something	you	hate?	Doesn’t	make	sense	to	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	sound	like	another	dreamer,”	said	Ed,	looking	from	Jen	to	Doug.	“What	a pair,	thinking	money	grows	on	trees.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sensed	Doug	about	to	rise	and	tugged	him	back.	Jen	leaned	toward	his father.	“Have	you	ever	seen	Doug’s	plays?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	blank	for	a	moment.	“Oh,	in	school.	I	think	we	drove	across	one time.”	He	looked	at	his	wife.	“Right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	play	made	me	cry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	that’s	when	I	said,	no	more,”	said	Ed.	“Who	wants	to	see	a	play	that	makes my	wife	cry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	stood	and	stared	at	Doug’s	father.	“I	know	the	answer	to	that	one,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thousands	of	people	do.	Every	week,	several	thousand	people	buy	tickets	to see	 <i class="calibre4">The	Broken	Circle </i>	on	Broadway.	How	can	you	not	know	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	know,”	said	Doug	joining	her.	“I	sent	them	tickets	for	opening	night	last year,	but	they	didn’t	come.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	mother	had	a	cold	and	a-a	fever,”	Eddie	protested.	“Besides,	it’s	expensive to	stay	at	a	hotel	in	New	York	and	too	far	to	drive	back	at	night…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	did	see	the	play,”	interrupted	Helen	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a>Her	husband	swiveled	toward	her,	and	she	continued.	“I	took	the	early	bus	to Port	Authority,	went	to	a	matinee,	and	took	the	bus	back	home.”	She	strolled over	to	place	a	hand	on	Doug’s	arm.	“I	cried	even	harder,	but	I	loved	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence	descended	until	Doug	said,	“You’re	the	heroine	in	this	drama,	Mom, that’s	for	sure.”	Then	he	put	his	arm	around	her	shoulder	and	kissed	her	cheek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	glanced	at	Doug’s	father.	The	man	looked	flummoxed.	“I	think	it’s	time	we made	an	exit,”	she	said	to	Doug	before	addressing	Helen.	“Glad	to	meet	you, Mrs.	Collins.	I’m	also	glad	you	like	the	theater.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	are	you	a	writer	like	Doug?”	asked	Helen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	chuckled.	“Sorry.	In	fact,	you	might	say	that	writing	is	my	least	favorite thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?	How	curious.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug’s	dad	left	his	chair	and	stepped	closer.	“So,	what	do	you	do	for	a	living? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	something	practical?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	winked	at	Doug,	then	faced	his	dad.	“You	could	say	I	help	people.	I	really help	them	a	lot,	teaching	them	how	to	budget.	Oh,	and	I	also	sing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eddie	moved	aside.	“Figures.	Between	the	two	of	them,	Helen,	they	probably earn	zilch.	Nothing.	nothing	steady.	She	sounds	like	a	social	worker.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	say	that,	Mr.	Collins,”	Jen	protested.	“Life	is	complicated,	and	people are	looking	for	all	kinds	of	advice	these	days.	I	happen	to	be	good	with numbers.”	She	told	no	lies,	but	when	she	imagined	how	little	support	the	man had	given	Doug	throughout	the	years,	she	chose	not	to	enlighten	him	further. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	nodded	and	reached	into	his	back	pocket.	“Do	you	need	any	money,	son?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	8</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Back	in	the	car,	Jen’s	thoughts	remained	on	Doug’s	father.	“Family	dynamics can	be	tricky,”	she	said,	“not	so	much	black-and-white	as	shades	of	gray. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Were	there	‘shades	of	gray’	in	your	house?”	he	challenged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	thoughts	flew	backward.	She’d	been	lucky	to	have	parents	who	made	a	fuss about	a	kindergarten	picture,	cheered	at	a	baseball	game	or	for	a	test	score—</p>
<p class="calibre1">always	encouraging,	always	praising.	And	sometimes	making	suggestions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	we	were	too	young…”	she	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	were	not	too	young,”	countered	Doug.	“Neither	was	Lisa.	Teenage	years could	wreak	havoc	in	a	family.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	paused,	thinking	back	carefully.	“I	wreaked	havoc,	as	you	say,	only	after they	were	gone.	I	gave	Lisa	and	Mike	a	few	big	headaches.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Understandable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ancient	history.”	She	patted	his	thigh.	“I’m	glad	you	were	able	to	turn	down your	dad’s	offer.	I	suspect	he’s	not	as	bad	as	he	seems.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe,	maybe	not.	That	was	guilt	talking.	He	was	trying	to	make	Mom	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I-I	can’t	quite	process	that	she	snuck	down	to	the	city	to	see	the	show	and	never told	anyone.	Not	even	me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	what	mothers	do.	For	their	children,	anything.	As	for	Eddie,	well	he knows	about	her	trip	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	shook	him	up.	Therefore,	he	offered	his	son,	the	playwright,	money,	which	he thinks	will	calm	the	water.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Jen	wasn’t	sure	that	was	the	only	reason.	“Maybe	he	loves	his	son.	Maybe he	worries	about	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>“Ha!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	thing’s	for	sure,”	said	Jen.	“He	may	be	awkward	and	blustery,	but	he	loves your	mom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	he’d	exchange	the	bluster	for	a	little	bit	of	tenderness,	sometimes,	and	maybe tell	her	out	loud	how	he	feels…she’d	be	better	off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	shrugged.	“That’s	her	lecture	to	give,	and	if	she	ever	gets	to	a	breaking	point, she	will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	leads	to	her	turning	point.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“’All	the	world’s	a	stage…’”	quoted	Doug.	“We	all	play	out	our	dramas.	My parents	are	no	different,	living	in	their	one-story	ranch	house	in	western Massachusetts.	Drama	lives	in	every	house	on	their	street,	in	every	home	in	the world.	Joy,	despair,	grief	and	hope…there	always	has	to	be	hope…and	then decisions	are	made.	A	path	is	chosen	or	a	new	idea	brings	an	aha	moment	and changes	a	person	inside.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	those	words,	Jen	glimpsed	a	window	into	Doug’s	soul.	“My	God.	That’s how	you	write	your	plays!	You	see	these	things.	You	capture	these	events,	these emotions.	And	you	can	make	others	feel	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence	was	his	only	answer	for	a	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	I	guess	I	do,”	he	finally	replied.	“But	I’m	not	only	an	observer.	I’ve	lived through	the	highs	and	lows	myself.	Here’s	how	I	look	at	it:	everyone	searches for	a	peaceful,	vanilla	life,	but	in	the	end,	they	find	that	life	is	mint	chocolate chip,	and	rocky	road.	Vanilla	is	an	unreliable	goal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh-h-h….”	Jen	clutched	her	stomach	at	her	aha	moment.	“You’re	right,”	she whispered.	“Vanilla	is	the	safer	road.	I’ve	planned	for	it,	fought	for	it.	But	then something	happens,	and—and…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	hijacked.	Staring	at	new	choices	on	a	rocky	road.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although	their	conversation	lingered,	Jen	was	on	familiar	turf	the	next	morning</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>and	could	fall	into	her	comfortable	role.	The	only	choices	she’d	be	making	were financial	ones	with	her	clients.	She	unlocked	her	computer	and	began	scrolling, but	stopped	at	the	company-wide	announcement	of	Matthew’s	promotion	and move	to	Kentucky.	His	last	day	at	headquarters	was	the	upcoming	Friday. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	heart	sank	for	a	moment,	but	she	tried	to	rally.	No	vanilla	here.	She’d consider	it	a	pistachio	event—for	them	all.	Hopefully	a	wonderful	turning	point for	Matt.	But	what	if	the	offer	had	been	hers?	What	if	she’d	turned	it	down because	she	wanted	the	safer	road?	What	if	that	safer	choice	ultimately destroyed	her	career? </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	refocused	on	the	screen.	Ridiculous	thoughts.	If	she	kept	it	up,	she’d	soon	be competing	with	Doug	in	the	drama	department. </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">Workwise,	Doug	shouldn’t	have	taken	time	off	to	go	with	Jen	to	Tanglewood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	Monday	night,	he	was	buried	in	scripts.	Revisions	to	 <i class="calibre4">The	Sanctuary </i>	came first.	Amazing	how	actors,	by	bringing	the	story	to	life,	and	by	reacting	to	the writing,	could	clearly	show	him	where	adjustments	were	needed,	where	he	could fix	a	phrase	that	may	have	seemed	good	on	paper,	but	when	spoken…not	so much.	He	grabbed	the	chance	to	revise	and	make	changes	for	the	better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	glanced	at	the	clock.	After	ten.	Shoot,	he	was	late	with	his	call.	That	ten o’clock	connection	had	become	a	nice	habit.	He	reached	for	his	cell,	but	it	rang before	he	could	connect.	Jen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Smiling,	he	answered	it.	“Hi	sweetie.	I	lost	track	of	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	figured.	You	must	be	elbow-deep	in	breaking	points	and	turning	points	and drama.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	you	really	listened!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	yeah.	And	another	turning	point	is	coming	up.	Matt’s	last	day	is	Friday. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz’s,	too.	Feel	like	joining	the	gang	for	our	private	farewell	party?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	if	he’d	miss	it.	“Maguires?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	scene	of	many	crimes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>“I’ll	be	there,	but	not	sure	exactly	when.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Crunch	time?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something	like	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	wasted	the	day	with	me	yesterday.	You	should’ve	been	working.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen	up,	sweetheart.	No	time	spent	with	you	is	wasted.	Remember	that.	I’m used	to	pulling	all-nighters.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	laugh	was	as	light	as	a	moonbeam.	“Like	we	were	still	in	school.	I remember	us	cramming	for	exams,	testing	each	other…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Keep	remembering	the	good	stuff,	Jenny.	I’ve	still	got	deadlines,	projects,	and	a new	curriculum	for	the	fall	to	finalize.	It’s	all	good.	And	being	here,	with	you again…what	can	I	say?	It’s	everything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I-I…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shush.	No	pressure.	I’m	a	patient	man.”	He	hadn’t	known	just	how	patient	until now.	He’d	give	her	all	the	time	she	needed	to	find	the	real	Jen,	the	girl	she’d turned	her	back	on	years	ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	say	only	one	thing,”	Jen	began	slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	tone	of	voice	put	him	on	alert.	“And	what	would	that	be?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I-I’m	glad	you	came	back.	Our	ending	was…rough.	But	we’re	adults	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever	happens	between	us	this	time	won’t	be	so	emotional.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	tried	not	to	laugh.	Where	did	she	get	her	ideas?	“Is	that	right,	my	Henny-Penny?	Are	you	saying	that	love	is	totally	rational?	Logical?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	don’t	put	words	in	my	mouth.	I	didn’t	say	anything	at	all	about	love.	It’s just-just…	oh,	forget	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	he	wouldn’t	forget	her	confusion,	her	effort	to	avoid	sharing	that	deepest	of all	emotions.	“You	do	realize	you’d	put	every	songwriter	out	of	business	if	love were	a	purely	rational	thing.	But	still,	you’re	giving	this	man	some	hope.	I	think</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a>my	next	play	will	be	called,  <i class="calibre4">The	Courtship	of	Jennifer	Delaney. </i>	It	will	be	an opus,	running	568	pages	and	taking	ten	hours	to	present.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	lose	a	bundle	on	that	one!”	she	said,	amusement	in	her	voice.	“Not	worth it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	me	decide	about	that.	Sweet	dreams,	Jenny.”	He	almost	danced	around	his apartment	after	disconnecting.	Pushing	 <i class="calibre4">The	Sanctuary </i>	aside,	he	pulled	over <i class="calibre4">Straight	from	the	Heart. </i>	There	was	no	one	like	Jennifer	Delaney	for	a	bit	of inspiration.	If	Steve	Kantor	wanted	to	see	a	play	instead	of	a	novel,	he’d	get	a play.	With	renewed	energy,	he	began	to	read.	Soon	his	fingers	tapped	the keyboard,	and	by	three	o’clock	in	the	morning,	he’d	shaped	the	first	act. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	matter	how	long	it	took	his	logic-only	love	to	listen	to	her	heart,	he’d	be waiting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">At	her	crowded	table	in	Maguire’s,	Jen	glanced	at	her	watch	for	the	third	time and	then	looked	toward	the	door—again.	If	Doug	didn’t	show	up	pretty	darn quick,	he’d	starve.	Tonight’s	send-off	for	Matt	and	Liz	had	morphed	into	a	party of	friends	who’d	taken	up	three	tables	and	had	already	scoffed	down	platters	of wings	and	meatballs,	not	to	mention	beer.	And	now	the	wait	staff	was	taking dinner	orders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	well…”	she	murmured,	“his	loss.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Talking	to	yourself?”	asked	Alexis,	“Or	to	the	guy	who	just	walked	through	the door?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	swiveled	around,	spotted	Doug,	and	felt	her	tension	ease.	“It’s	just	that	he said	he’d	be	here,”	she	protested,	“said	he	wouldn’t	miss	it…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alexis	laughed	and	patted	her	arm.	“Man,	you’ve	got	it	bad.	Doug	seems	like	a great	guy.	I	hope	it	works	out	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,”	said	Jen,	watching	Doug	weave	his	way	through	the	tables.	“But	I’m not	sure…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Typical,”	Alexis	replied	with	a	dismissive	wave.	“You	should	have	seen	my</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>sister	after	meeting	John,	who	is	now	her	husband.	What	a	wreck	she	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">almost-walking-into-walls	kind	of	wreck.	She	was	up,	down	and	sideways.	But I’ve	never	seen	her	happier	than	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?	Lisa	and	Mike	were	different,”	Jen	said,	ruminating.	“Crazy	about	each other	from	Day	One.	It	was	only	later…because	of	us…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alexis	squeezed	her	hand.	“Forget	it.	Live	in	the	present.	And	speaking	of presents…here’s	yours.	Hi,	Doug.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry	I’m	late,”	he	said,	after	greeting	the	crowd	in	general.	He	slipped	into	the booth	across	from	Jen,	leaned	over	and	kissed	her	quickly	on	the	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	responded	as	naturally	as	if	they	touched	every	day.  <i class="calibre4">Oh,	God,	this	is	too</i> <i class="calibre4">easy.	What	am	I	doing?	Is	it	just	a	habit?	How	will	I	know?	Stop!	Stop	thinking. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">There’s	no	rush. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	a	week,”	continued	Doug,	smiling	at	her,	“and	the	weekend	looks	almost the	same…except…for	this.”	He	whipped	out	a	pair	of	tickets.	“A	gift	from	the theater	management.	Red	Sox	game	tomorrow	night	at	7:05.	Wanna	go?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course,	she	does,”	said	Alexis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	right	here,	girlfriend.”	Jen	rolled	her	eyes	at	Alexis	before	turning	her attention	to	Doug.	“I’d	rather	watch	my	brothers	play	in	their	summer	league, but	since	that’s	out,	I’ll	settle	for	Fenway	and	the	Red	Sox.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Knowing	your	family,	maybe	one	day,	your	brothers	really	will	play	at	Fenway Park.”	Doug	grabbed	a	lonely	fry	and	popped	it	into	his	mouth.	“Cold,	but	I’m hungry.	Worked	through	lunch.	No	finger	foods	for	me	tonight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	too	late	anyway,”	said	Jen,	“but	now	you’re	in	luck.	Bonnie’s	here	to take	your	order.	Maybe	she’ll	feel	sorry	for	you	and	rush	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	listened	to	him	chat	up	their	usual	server,	creating	an	instant	rapport,	and was	amazed	at	the	amount	of	food	he	wanted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	glanced	at	her	when	he	was	finally	done.	“What?	What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	my	expression	so	readable?”	Jen	asked	with	a	laugh.	“You’ve	ordered</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a>enough	for	five	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tomorrow’s	lunch	is	in	there.	I	won’t	have	to	waste	time	making	something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	so	pleased	with	himself,	she	wanted	laugh.	But	she	also	wanted	to know	more.	“So,	are	you	drowning	or	just	totally	immersed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Totally	immersed	and	feeling	great.	But	always	thinking	about	the	deadline. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	baby	opens	in	three	short	months.	September	14th,	to	be	exact.	Mark	it	in your	calendar!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’d	engrave	it	in	her	memory.	“Looks	like	no	summer	vacation	for	you,	that’s for	sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	always	next	year.	This	play’s	more	important	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	understand	that,”	she	said,	nodding,	but	then	teased,	“so	you	won’t	be	jealous when	I’m	at	the	Cape?	I	usually	take	long	weekends,	which	seem	so	short!	In fact,	the	whole	summer	always	seems	to	speed	by	every	year.	I	guess	I	like	the beach!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Time’s	a	funny	thing,	Jenny.	It’s	elastic.	It	speeds	by	when	you’re	happy	and busy,	and	crawls	when	you’re	miserable.	When	I	first	got	to	New	York—</p>
<p class="calibre1">hmm….someday,	I’ll	tell	you	how	slow	motion	feels.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	lighthearted	conversation	darkened.	She’d	thought	he’d	forget	about	her with	all	the	new	challenges	he’d	faced	in	the	Big	Apple.	She’d	told	herself	what they’d	had	was	a	puppy	love.	But	the	longing	in	his	gaze	at	that	moment	put	a	lie to	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow,”	she	whispered	ruefully.	“I	knew	it	would	be	tough.	but	my	idea	wasn’t meant	to….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	smile	returned	as	though	it	had	never	disappeared.	“Right	now,	I	have	an idea	you’re	going	to	love.”	He	stood	and	called	out	to	the	couple	of	honor, urging	Matt	and	Liz	to	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	about	you	guys	plan	on	a	trip	back	here	for	opening	night	of	 <i class="calibre4">The</i> <i class="calibre4">Sanctuary. </i>	It’ll	give	all	of	us	something	extra	to	look	forward	to	—an	excuse	for a	big	reunion.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>Jen	watched	her	girlfriend’s	smile	grow	while	Matt	nodded.	“If	we	can	swing	it, we	sure	will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	we’ll	swing	it,”	said	Liz.	“I’m	excited	about	Kentucky,	but	I’m	determined not	to	lose	touch	with	my	friends	here.	My	mom	still	has	friends	from	her childhood,	and	that	is	one	attribute	I	want	to	emulate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	Liz,	I’m	so	glad,”	said	Jen.	Impulsively,	she	squeezed	her	friend’s	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	got	to	find	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	Jennifer.	We’ve	got	to	 <i class="calibre4">make </i>	time.	Laziness	is	out!	My	mother	said	it	takes effort.	‘Don’t	stand	on	ceremony.	Pick	up	the	phone,’”	she	always	told	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	never	heard	of	email?”	asked	Matt.	“Texting’s	even	better.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	had	plenty	to	say	about	that,	too!	Nothing	replaces	a	phone	call	or	a	real visit.	So	your	idea	is	perfect,	Doug.	We’ll	be	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	watched	the	couple	walk	away	and	chat	with	others.	Tears	stung	her	eyes, which	surprised	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jenny!	What’s	wrong?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shook	her	head.	“Nothing.	Nothing.	I’m	just	an	idiot.”	And	now	he’d	have questions.	The	guy	was	totally	tuned	into	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	won’t	lose	Lizzy,	sweetheart.	You	heard	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know.	It’s	just…”	Well	maybe	he	deserved	the	truth.	“I’m	not	Liz.”	She	could barely	get	the	words	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And?”	he	replied	softly,	his	tone	neutral. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	glanced	up.	“Tuned	in”	was	barely	the	right	expression.	He	was	laser-focused	on	her.	“I	admire	her	attitude.	She’s	brave	to	go	so	far	away.	Despite everything,	I-I	still	don’t	think	I	could	do	it,”	she	whispered,	as	tears	threatened once	more.	And	if	she	couldn’t,	she’d	disappoint	him	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	an	instant,	he	stood	next	to	her.	“C’mon.”	He	pulled	her	up	and	held	her	close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	one’s	forcing	you,	Jen.	I’m	certainly	not.	And	think	about	this:	if	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>confession	is	upsetting	you…	you’ve	actually	opened	yourself	to	possibilities.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had	she?	For	a	long	time,	the	idea	of	leaving	her	family	had	been	a	closed	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’d	slammed	it	shut	and	thrown	away	the	key.	Until	Doug	had	come	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Until	she’d	opened	up	her	eyes	to	those	around	her,	like	Liz	and	Matt.	She’d hidden	her	head	when	other	co-workers	had	relocated,	but	she	couldn’t	hide	this time.	Liz	was	a	real	friend.	So	was	the	rest	of	her	Friday	night	crew.	“I	guess nothing	stays	the	same,”	she	admitted,	“and	that	gives	me	a	stomachache.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	a	shrink	in	disguise?”	she	asked,	suddenly	suspicious,	and	suddenly recalling	that	he’d	minored	in	psychology.	“Sometimes	I	think	you	know	me better	than	I	know	myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	cocked	his	head,	and	a	tiny	smile	emerged.	But	all	he	said	was,	“Don’t	give me	too	much	credit,	Jenny.	You’re	not	as	unique	as	you	might	imagine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	gets	uptight	when	changes	hit	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	nodded	at	the	couple	approaching	the	mic.	Matt	and	Liz.	“And	then,	I	guess, you	sing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’d	been	singing	all	her	life,	all	types	of	music.	But	it	hadn’t	made	her	a braver	person.	In	fact,	it	provided	cover,	keeping	her	too	busy	to	think. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	opening	notes	started,	familiar	and	perfect,	from	the	Beatles—and	perfect for	the	couple	facing	a	new	adventure—who	sang	about	getting	by	with	a	little help	from	their	friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	took	it	all	in	while	swirling	in	a	whirlpool	of	emotion—sadness,	joy,	regret, anger,	disappointment.	Her	friends	had	found	what	she	had	lost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	lost,	she	corrected	herself.	What	she	had	rejected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	studied	the	man	who’d	been	the	boy	she’d	loved.	The	man	who	still	set	her heart	racing,	the	man	who	seemed	to	have	the	patience	of	Job,	at	least	with	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	he	was	also	a	man	determined	to	fulfill	his	goals	and	ambitions.	A	man	who wasn’t	afraid	of	anything,	not	even	of	taking	another	chance	on	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>She	closed	her	eyes,	wishing	she	felt	stronger,	wishing	she	could	talk	to	her mom.	Lucky	Liz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	my	mom	were	still	here,	we	wouldn’t	be	in	this	situation.	If	my	folks	were still	around…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	might	not	have	met,”	interrupted	Doug.	“Stop	torturing	yourself	and	move on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stared	at	him,	wide-eyed.	“That	sounded	fierce.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	time,	Jen.	It’s	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	he	only	knew	how	much	she	agreed,	how	much	she	wanted	to	put	the	past high	on	that	shelf	he’d	once	mentioned.	If	he	only	knew	how	many	doubts	she had	about	herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	maybe	he	did.	His	warm	smile	reappeared	and	reassured.	“It’ll	be	all	right, Jenny.”	He	turned	toward	the	stage.	“Hey,	listen	up,  <i class="calibre4">Here	Comes	the	Sun! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Perfect.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	9</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	morning,	Jen	hummed	the	Beatles’	tunes	from	the	party,	then	changed to	 <i class="calibre4">Take	Me	Out	to	the	Ballgame </i>	as	she	flew	through	her	usual	weekend	chores. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	stranger	to	household	tasks,	she	was	finished	by	noon	and	looking	forward	to enjoying	her	night	out	with	Doug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Baseball	parks	were	happy	places.	So	were	football	stadiums.	As	soon	as someone	entered	a	sports	arena,	all	real-life	problems	were	left	outside	the	gate and	forgotten	for	a	while.	Tonight	would	be	a	delightful	interlude	where	she	and Doug	could	just	have	fun	with	the	rest	of	the	crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	brought	her	manicure	supplies	to	the	kitchen	table	just	as	the	phone	rang. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	checking	the	readout,	she	answered,	“Doug?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lisa!	Hello,	hello.	I’m	amazed	you	found	five	minutes	to	call.	Has	Brianna finally	stopped	the	crying	jags	and	is	she	letting	you	get	some	sleep?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence.	“I-I’m	afraid	not.	The	pediatrician	said	she’s	colicky.	She	just	cries	and cries	and	never	sleeps.	I	massage	her,	rub	her	tummy,	walk	her,	hold	her	and…</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I’m	so	tired,	I	could	cry	myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	Lis.	I	knew	you	had	your	hands	full,	but	I	didn’t	know	the	baby	was	such	a challenge.	What	does	the	doctor	suggest?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	much.	She’ll	outgrow	it	by	four	months.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh.”	Three	months	more	of	non-stop	crying.	She	could	think	of	nothing	to counter	with.	“Where’s	Mike?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	took	Bobby	outside	to	play.	We	wanted	to	go	to	the	Cape	for	a	couple	of weeks	before	the	season	starts,	but	I	don’t	have	the	desire	or	the	energy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	her	dismay,	Jen	heard	her	sister	start	to	cry.	Mostly	about	how	tired	she	was and	that	she	needed	to	get	some	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>“I	have	an	idea,	Lis,	and	don’t	react	immediately.	How	about	calling	in	a	baby nurse	for	a	few	weeks,	just	so	you	can	get	back	to	yourself?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	you	sound	like	Mike!	But	Brianna’s	 <i class="calibre4">my </i>	baby!	I	don’t	want	some	stranger taking	care	of	her.	Mom	never	had	a	nurse	for	you	or	any	of	us,	not	even	the twins.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	stopped	breathing	for	a	moment.	Her	big,	strong	sister	wasn’t	immune	to allowing	the	past	ruin	the	present	either.	It	felt	too	familiar.	“Now	you	listen	to me,	Lisa	Delaney-Brennan.	Mom	didn’t	need	help.	None	of	us	were	colicky!	We would	have	heard	stories	about	it	if	we	were.	You	are	a	wonderful	mother,	and you	have	to	do	what’s	right	for	you	and	your	precious	family.	And	our	mother would	be	the	first	to	tell	you	the	same	thing.	If	it	means	getting	a	baby	nurse	for a	couple	of	weeks	or	months,	then	do	it!	Mike	loves	you	to	pieces.	He	wants	you healthy.	Heck,	we	all	want	you	healthy	and	happy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	ran	out	of	steam	but	wanted	to	cry.	Lisa	had	been	the	strong	one,	taking	on responsibility	no	young	woman	should	have	had	to	face.	Four	younger	siblings to	raise—with	Mike—but	those	days	were	tough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jen?”	Her	sister’s	voice	sounded	stronger	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah?”	Jen	replied	with	caution.	Was	Lisa	going	to	argue? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was	this	what	you	meant	about	the	Delaney-Brennan	clan	supporting	each other?”	Somehow,	laughter	filled	Lisa’s	voice	now.	Jen	didn’t	want	to	question it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	certainly	is.	Sticking	together	by	being	truthful.	We’re	not	only	sisters,	Lis, but	we’re	also	friends.	That’s	the	way	I	see	it.	I	love	you,	and	I	trust	you,	and you	can	count	on	me,	too.	I’ll	come	over	to	babysit	whenever	you	need	me.	We have	each	other’s	backs.	Mom	and	Dad	would	second	my	advice.	Hire	a	nurse! </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	don’t	feel	guilty	about	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa’s	voice	came	softly.	“When	did	you	get	so	smart?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	smart,	Lis,	but	I-I’ve	been	thinking	about	things	lately.	I’m	trying	to process	Liz	and	Matt	moving	away…and	I’m	working	on	other	stuff.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	betting	Doug	Collins	figures	into	all	these	new	ideas	you’re	having.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>Her	sister	was	sharp.	“Could	be.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	all	I’ll	say	is	that	he	can’t	take	his	eyes	off	you.	Maybe	this	time	around will	be	the	right	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe.	“Do	you	want	me	to	watch	Brianna	for	a	few	hours	so	you	can	get	some sleep?	It’s	now	or	tomorrow.	Doug	and	I	are	going	to	Fenway	tonight.”	She couldn’t	disappoint	Doug.	She	had	to	show	him	she	could	balance	family	and their	time	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Enjoy	yourself,	and	thanks	for	the	offer,	but	I’ve	got	it.	Maybe	I	just	needed some	sister	time.	Some	sister	approval.	You	and	I,	Jenny,	are	the	ones	who	share that	memory	bank	of	the	early	years	with	Mom	and	Dad.	After	Mike,	you	know you’re	my	go-to	person.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	I	hope	I	never	let	you	down,”	Jen	replied.	“Sometimes,	I	still	feel	I’m	your lieutenant,	handling	the	younger	ones.	But	I’m	not	as	concerned	today	as	I	was back	then.	Mike	turned	out	to	be	one	of	the	good	guys.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	always	known	that,”	said	Lisa,	“and	I	thank	God	for	him	every	day.	But Mike’s	not	the	last	of	the	good	guys.	You	might	have	found	one	yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	may	be	right.	How	about	I	let	you	know	as	soon	as	I’m	sure.”	She disconnected,	realizing	she’d	misled	her	sister	a	little.	Doug	was	definitely	one of	the	good	guys.	Just	thinking	about	him	made	her	smile.	But	he	deserved	a totally	devoted	partner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Funny	how	her	siblings	thought	she	was	so	strong.	She’d	really	been	her	sister’s right	hand	in	the	old	days,	and	she’d	always	come	through.	But	when	it	came	to charting	her	own	path,	well…she	didn’t	feel	that	resilient. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	ambled	over	to	the	wall	of	family	pictures	in	her	living	room,	examining them	one	by	one.	The	handsome	twins	with	their	sparkling	green	eyes	towered over	her	six	months	ago!	Emily’s	smile	blazed	from	the	frame,	a	beautiful	young adult.	Lisa	glowed	with	early	pregnancy,	her	gaze	on	Mike’s	beaming	face	while he	held	their	son.	Andy,	Brian	and	Em	were	maturing	into	the	people	they	would become.	Lisa	and	Mike	had	a	handle	on	everything.	The	younger	ones	didn’t need	Jen	to	solve	their	little	problems	anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stroked	the	portrait	of	her	parents,	which	hung	center	stage	in	her	family</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>gallery.	“Your	children	are	growing	up,	my	loves,	and	you	are	not	here	to	see	it happen,	which	is	just	too	terrible	to	dwell	on.”	A	kaleidoscope	of	images	came	to her	mind:	little	Bobby,	named	for	his	grandpa,	Emily	playing	her	violin,	Lisa finally	receiving	her	law	degree	after	dropping	out	of	law	school	twice,	Andy and	Brian	on	a	baseball	field—it	really	was	too	much—her	parents	missing	all	of that. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Thank	you	both	for	getting	us	off	to	a	good	start.	I	know	money	was	always	tight</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">—I	remember	you	celebrating	every	mortgage	payment—but	you	gave	us	more</i> <i class="calibre4">security	that	you	can	imagine.	Singing	while	doing	the	supper	dishes,	Dad’s</i> <i class="calibre4">corny	jokes	and	his	energy.	It	worked!	I	still	sing,	Mom!	We	all	do. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">But	no	song	emerged	then.	Her	throat	closed,	her	voice	faded	and	her	tears flowed.	It	didn’t	matter.	She	took	another	breath	and	collapsed	onto	the	sofa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mom…Dad…I	need	to	tell	you	something	important.”	She	inhaled	again.	“I’ve met	someone.	He-he’s	special.	We’ve	had	a	rough	patch,	but	this	guy	—	Doug Collins	—	he	doesn’t	give	up.	More	important,	I	think	he	understands	me.	And my	fear	of	letting	go.	I	promise	you	that	we’ll	always	be	the	Delaney	family,	but I	have	a	feeling	we’re	all	going	in	different	directions.	And	that	scares	me.	I-I just	had	to	tell	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	hugged	her	stomach	and	let	her	tears	flow.	And	she	could	just	hear	how	her dad	might	advise	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Everyone	is	scared,	Jennifer.	You’re	not	alone.	Courage	requires	a	leap	of	faith,</i> <i class="calibre4">but	happiness	requires	taking	that	leap	with	the	right	partner.	Is	this	Doug	the</i> <i class="calibre4">one? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	weight	lifted.	She	sat	up	straighter	and	listened	harder.	Her	parents	were	only	a conversation	away.	Maybe	that’s	why	Lisa	had	filled	journals	in	the	beginning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	communicate,	to	understand.	To	be	more	in	touch	with	them… <i class="calibre4">or	with</i> <i class="calibre4">herself. </i>	Yes!	That	must	be	it.	Maybe	that’s	why	Doug	wrote	plays.	He	was always	trying	to	make	sense	of	a	complicated,	messy	world.	Always	trying	to find	hope	in	dark	places. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finance	was	much	easier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	walked	closer	to	the	portraits	again.	If	talking	to	her	folks	helped	her	to	face her	fears,	she’d	go	to	them	a	million	times,	and	never	chat	with	another	shrink again.	Which	she	hadn’t	done	in	several	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a> <i class="calibre4">“I	know	you’re	out	there	somewhere…” </i>	she	sang	softly,	as	the	Moody	Blues’</p>
<p class="calibre1">lyrics	came	into	her	head.	Maybe	she	and	Emily	had	more	in	common	than	she’d realized.	She’d	have	to	listen	more	closely	the	next	time	her	sister	played <i class="calibre4">Amazing	Grace. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	wonderful	night	for	a	baseball	game.”	Jen	paused	in	their	walk	toward Fenway	Park	and	pointed	upward.	“A	clear	sky,	perfect	temperature	and	…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“…and	we’re	together,”	finished	Doug,	clasping	her	hand.	“Let’s	get	moving, and	I’ll	tell	you	a	story	about	the	oldest	ballpark	in	Major	League	Baseball.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	wasn’t	much	about	Fenway	he	could	tell	her	that	she	didn’t	already	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Green	Monster,	The	Triangle,	The	Lone	Red	Seat.	And	Neil	Diamond’s <i class="calibre4">Sweet	Caroline </i>	in	the	middle	of	the	eighth	inning	every	single	game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	got	a	story	for	everything,”	she	said,	“but	I’ve	been	here	many	times—</p>
<p class="calibre1">whenever	Andy	and	Brian	‘allowed’	me	to	take	them!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holding	hands	with	Doug	felt	so	right,	joking	around	felt	right,	too.	With	her free	hand,	Jen	reached	up	to	brush	that	stubborn	lock	of	hair	from	the	man’s eyes.	He	snatched	her	palm	and	covered	it	with	kisses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	makes	it	official,”	he	said.	“We’re	finally	on	a	real	date.	No	interruptions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	Just	you	and	me…and	thousands	of	others.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	time	he	stopped	walking	and	pulled	her	close.	“I	love	you	like	this,	Jen.	So relaxed,	so	joking,	so	pretty.	I	knew	we	could	find	it	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	put	her	finger	across	his	mouth.	“No	words.	Just	let	the	evening	play	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	she	squeezed	his	hand	and	felt	herself	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	continued	strolling	to	the	entrance	on	Jersey	Street.	“See	how	the	park blends	into	the	neighborhood.	All	the	buildings	are	similar,”	said	Doug, gesturing	toward	the	surrounding	streets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	It’s	a	real	city	ballpark	and	a	very	small	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a>“That’s	for	sure.	Can’t	even	hold	forty	thousand	fans.	So,	here’s	the	story:	In 1984,	Roger	Clemens	arrived	in	Boston	for	the	first	time	and	took	a	taxi	to	the park.”	He	paused	and	looked	at	her.	“You	do	know	who	Roger	Clemens	is,	don’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Laughing,	she	nodded.	“Pitcher.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	when	the	cab	arrived,	Clemens	argued	with	the	driver.	Told	him	Fenway Park	was	a	baseball	stadium	and	this	building	was	nothing	but	a	warehouse!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?”	she	asked	with	a	chuckle.	“Okay,	I	hadn’t	heard	that	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Want	to	hear	the	ending?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	could	she	let	him	down?	“Of	course,	I	want	the	ending.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	driver	told	him	to	look	up.	And	when	he	did,	Clemens	saw	the	stadium light	towers	and	knew	he	was	in	the	right	place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Just	as	I	am. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	like	it.	Wonderful	bit	of	Fenway	history.”	Jen	tilted	her	head	back	and	stared at	his	familiar	face,	the	face	she’d	never	forgotten,	and	saw	nothing	else.	Not	the park,	not	the	buildings,	not	the	other	pedestrians. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	you	smile	at	me	like	that…”	His	voice	was	raspy	as	he	leaned	toward her.	She	tilted	her	head	back,	waiting…and	was	rewarded.	His	kiss	was	strong and	exploring.	And	with	his	arms	snugly	around	her,	Jen’s	world	became	rock solid.	Until…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	look	at	them	go!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Save	it	for	the	KISS-CAM.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	a	home	run	in	sight,	and	the	game	hasn’t	even	started!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	whistles	came,	hoots	and	hollers,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	my	God,”	said	Jen,	hiding	herself	against	Doug’s	chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	deep	laughter	was	all	she	heard.	“They’re	just	having	fun—and	they’re</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>jealous	of	the	luckiest	guy	around!	But	I	like	the	idea	of	a	KISS-CAM.	Let	the whole	world	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	shook	her	head,	basking	in	her	personal	discovery.	“I’d	like	to	enjoy	our	own world	for	a	while	longer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whatever	you	want,	sweetheart.	You	call	the	shots.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	entered	the	stadium	holding	hands,	until	Doug	had	to	produce	their	tickets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm…nice.	I	was	too	busy	working	to	give	it	much	thought,	but	we’re	near center	field.	We’ve	got	to	climb,	but	we’ll	have	a	good	view.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	look,”	said	Jen,	pointing	at	the	scoreboard.	“Red	Sox	vs.	Yankees.	What could	be	better	than	Boston	against	New	York?”	Jennifer	grinned	up	at	him.	“My brothers	would	have	loved	to	be	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	I’m	glad	to	have	you	alone!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	found	their	seats,	not	surprised	to	be	surrounded	by	fans.	“Looks	like	a sold-out	game,”	said	Jen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can	say	that	again,	girlie,”	commented	the	big	man	sitting	next	to	her	with large	cup	of	beer	in	hand.	“And	we’re	gonna	show	those	Yankees	how	baseball is	played	in	Boston.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hope	so,”	she	said,	before	turning	toward	Doug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Want	to	change	seats	with	me?”	Doug	asked	quietly.	“That	guy’s	partying already	and	the	game	hasn’t	even	started	yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	patted	his	hand.	“He’s	just	enjoying	the	anticipation.	Do	you	think	a	Riders’</p>
<p class="calibre1">game	with	quarterback	Mike	Brennan	is	a	tea	party?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bad	analogy,	sweetheart.	That	Boston	Tea	Party	was	not	a	timid	event.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	okay,”	she	said	with	a	groan.	“But	you	get	my	meaning.	And	after	all, how	many	Yankee	fans	would	travel	here	just	for	a	regular	game?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyes	opened	wide.	“Are	you	kidding?	A	lot.	Take	a	look.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>Jen	began	noting	all	the	navy	blue	caps	with	New	York’s	signature	white	NY	in front.	Yankee	fans	were	scattered	everywhere,	including	in	the	row	in	front	of theirs.	Doug’s	observation	might	have	been	accurate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“New	York	and	Boston	are	really	not	that	far	apart,”	Doug	said	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	just	a	nanosecond,	Jen’s	stomach	tightened.	But	distance	was	not	an	issue now.	In	fact,	maybe	her	tension	was	an	automatic	response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Point	taken.	New	York	is	a	fine	place—to	visit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	laughter	was	contagious.	“From	time	to	time,	as	needed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	that’s	progress.”	His	quick	hug	and	kiss	increased	her	confidence.	Trips	to Broadway?	She’d	handle	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	score	by	the	end	of	the	third. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	what	happens	when	two	great	teams	play	each	other,”	said	Jen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whatchu	talking	about,	girlie?	The	Sox	rule!”	came	the	voice	next	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	according	to	the	scoreboard	yet,”	answered	Jen,	pointing	at	the	Green Monster.	“Look!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jus’	you	wait,	sister.	Jus’	you	wait.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	turned	her	head	toward	Doug.	“I	think	our	neighbor	is	taking	this	game	very seriously.	And	starting	to	slur	his	words.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	is	the	guy	right	in	front	of	us	—	the	one	with	the	New	York	cap.	They’ve been	at	each	other	the	entire	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know.	All	I	can	say	is,	gedouddahere.”	Doug	laughed.	“Exactly	right.	But now,	switch	seats	with	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	wrapped	her	arms	around	his	neck.	“You	want	to	be	my	hero?	You	want	to take	those	slings	and	arrows	for	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>Doug	stood.	“Move	over,	Ms.	Slings	and	Arrows.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh,	life	was	good.	She	loved	this	guy.	She	loved	his	repartee,	his	humor,	and	his intelligence.	Had	admired	those	traits	years	ago	and	fell	hard.	Maybe	that’s why…even	when	she’d	dated	others,	she’d	never	given	them	a	real	chance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cheering	and	groaning	came	from	the	crowd	as	New	York	scored	a	run. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Sox	aren’t	ruling	now,”	came	the	voice	from	the	bleacher	below.	The	guy stood	up	and	glared	at	the	man	next	to	Doug,	who	wasted	no	time	responding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that	right?	You’d	better	respect	where	you	are.	This	is	Boston!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take	it	easy,	guys,”	said	Doug.	“It’s	only	the	fourth.	Anything	can	happen.	It’s still	anybody’s	game.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	New	York	fan	sat	back	down,	and	Jen	turned	to	Doug.	“I’m	spoiled.	At	the Riders’	home	games,	I’m	always	in	a	private	box	with	the	family.	Now	I’m	out and	about	with	the	real	people.	Whew!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	isn’t	it	fun?”	He	eye-rolled	their	neighbors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">New	York	got	another	hit	and	the	fan	stood	up	to	cheer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sit	down,	you’re	blocking	the	view.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whaddayou	care?	Your	team	sucks!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	inning	ended,	and	Boston	was	now	at	bat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	the	magic	happened	for	Beantown.	One	out.	Three	men	on	base,	and the	next	batter	hit	it	hard	and	high	into	the	stands.	Jen	figured	the	noise	from	the crowd	could	be	heard	in	the	street.	The	three	players	on	base	ran	home	and Boston	had	a	two-run	lead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen’s	neighbor	was	quick	to	strike.	“And	you	said	my	team	sucks?	Ha!	Can’t	say that	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	happened	fast	after	that.	The	NY	fan	stood,	his	full	cup	of	beer spilling	all	over	Jen,	Doug	and	the	Boston	fan,	who	quickly	rose	with	his	fist</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>raised.	Doug	stepped	sideways,	shoved	both	guys	away	and	got	punched	in	the shoulder.	“Someone	call	security!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doug!”	Jen	cried,	trying	to	pull	him	back.	“Leave	them	alone.	You’ll	get	hurt more.”	She	turned	toward	new	voices.	“Oh,	good.	Security’s	coming.	And they’re	big.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	going	quietly,	boys,”	one	of	the	guards	said.	“This	game’s	over	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	ignored	the	rest.	“Doug,	are	you	all	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Didn’t	feel	a	thing.	But	look	at	that.	We’re	famous.”	He	pointed	at	the	big screen	where	all	the	action	had	been	covered.	“Who	needs	a	KISS-CAM?”	He took	her	in	his	arms	and	bestowed	the	biggest,	sweetest,	hungriest	kiss…and without	hesitation,	she	responded	like	a	thirsty	woman	stranded	in	the	desert. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	my	love,”	she	whispered.	“As	long	as	you’re	all	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	hands	lingered	on	her	face,	fingers	gently	tracing	the	contours	of	her	jaw. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blinking	twice,	he	said,	“I’ve	never	felt	better.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	Jen.	I’ve	dreamed	of	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	are	such	a	romantic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	grin	warmed	her	heart.	“That	I	am.	And	now	that	I’ve	got	you	in	a	tender moment,	here’s	a	question:	how’d	you	like	to	go	to	New	York	with	me	next weekend?	I’ve	got	to	work	with	the	new	lead	for	 <i class="calibre4">The	Broken	Circle </i>	while	she figures	out	how	to	‘make	the	part	her	own.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	10</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	following	Thursday	evening,	Jen	packed	a	bag	for	a	weekend	in	New	York while	still	grinning	at	the	reaction	to	their	experience	at	Fenway.	It	seemed	the whole	world	had	been	watching	the	game	that	night.	Her	cell	had	rung	non-stop as	Lisa,	Mike	and	her	brothers	called	for	details.	Liz	and	Matt	called.	Alexis offered	her	opinion	that	Doug	was	a	“keeper.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hear	you,	I	hear	you,”	Jen	had	replied,	“and	I’m	starting	to	feel	that	way myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.	I	think	a	lot	of	what	happens	is	about	timing.	Look	at	our	gang	at	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	were	all	chugging	along	for	a	few	years,	but	now	things	are	changing,	and sometimes	it’s	hard	to	adjust.	Anyway,	I’m	glad	we’re	still	here	in	town.	At	least for	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alexis	was	right	about	changes,	but	Jen	hummed	as	she	set	her	bag	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	difference	Doug	caused	in	her	life	now	seemed	wonderful.	Nothing	to	be afraid	of.	The	knock	came	exactly	as	she	wheeled	the	suitcase	into	the	hallway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ready?”	asked	Doug,	examining	her	face.	“You’re	good	with	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	weekend	in	New	York	is	great.	With	all	that’s	available	for	tourists,	I	can surely	keep	myself	busy	while	you’re	working.	There’s	actually	a	tour	of	Radio City	Music	Hall—a	behind-the-scenes	look.	I’d	love	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course,	you	would!	But	remember,	show	time	is	at	eight	o’clock.	I’d	like	us both	to	see	the	Friday	night	and	Saturday	matinee	performances.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?”	she	asked,	leading	them	out	the	door.	“Sounds	a	bit	bor—…	ah,	too much,	no?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	bit	boring,	you	say?”	But	his	eyes	twinkled.	“Not	to	the	playwright.	Every audience	is	different,	particularly	matinees	versus	evenings,	and	I	always	like eavesdropping	and	watching	reactions	to	each	performance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Has	the	new	actress	studied	the	current	production?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>“Oh,	yeah.	She	was	actually	in	the	original	cast	in	a	supporting	role	for	six months.	Then	went	to	another	show	in	a	bigger	role.	And	when	she	heard	we were	going	to	cast	a	new	lead,	she	auditioned.	She’s	really	good,	and	I’m	sure she’ll	want	to	interpret	the	part	her	own	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then,	I	guess	you’ll	have	to	go	back	and	see	her	in	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yup.	Her	opening	is	in	two	weeks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	in	his	voice…a	tightness,	wariness.	“Just	think	of	it	as	a	commute, Jenny.	Lots	of	people	do	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	watched	him	stow	her	bag	in	the	trunk	of	his	car	and	slam	the	lid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	that.	Business	is	business,”	she	said,	“and	a	playwright	always	aims	for Broadway.”	Her	thoughts	raced.	They	were	paying	a	fortune	for	a	three-night stay	at	a	hotel,	and	if	he	had	to	commute	regularly…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe,”	she	said,	hearing	her	voice	quiver,	“you	shouldn’t	have	given	up	your apartment.	Hotel	costs	are	outrageous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	spun	toward	her.	“Don’t	even	go	there.	I	couldn’t	lie	to	you	about	that.	My home’s	in	Boston	now.	That’s	where	I	want	to	be.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	maybe	not	where	he	should	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Besides,”	he	continued.	“I	can	bunk	in	with	Steve	Kantor	when	you’re	not around.	Hopefully,	you’ll	meet	him	this	weekend.	He	knows	the	business	and we’re	good	friends.	Actually,	I	want	to	introduce	you	to	everyone,	and	I’ll	also take	you	on	a	personal	tour	backstage	after	the	matinee.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	absorbed	his	words	and	nodded.	He	was	anxious	that	she	understand	his world.	To	make	her	part	of	it.	Did	he	simply	want	to	educate	her	so	they	could have	lively	conversations?	Or	did	he	want	her	buy-in	so	she’d	consider	making	a change	in	the	future?	A	future	that	was	becoming	more	definite.	In	his	quiet	way, Doug	was	like	a	five-star	general	executing	a	complex	campaign. </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">They	stopped	off	for	dinner	half-way	through	the	almost	five-hour	drive,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>Doug’s	mind	seemed	to	be	elsewhere.	“Just	order	me	anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	standing	in	line	in	a	fast	food	joint,”	she	said.	“Hamburger	or	chicken?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hope	you	don’t	mind,”	he	said.	“I	really	don’t	want	to	linger	over	dinner.	Next time	we’ll	fly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	pressed	herself	against	him.	“Hey.	What’s	wrong?	It’s	your	first	time	back since	you	moved.	Are	you	facing	a	reality	check	of	some	kind?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	snuggled	her	in	close.	“The	usual.	Only	twenty-four	hours	in	a	day.	I’m going	to	be	buried	in	work	the	entire	weekend.”	He	looked	sad,	and	so apologetic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	that.	Business	is	business	behind	the	scenes.	The	audience	is	having	all the	fun.”	She	reached	for	their	food	order	and	led	the	way	to	a	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	it	will	make	you	feel	better,	we	don’t	see	the	starting	quarterback	of	the Boston	Riders	very	much	during	the	season	either.	He	comes,	he	goes,	he sleeps.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	grin	slowly	emerged.	“Then	I	owe	him	another	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	once	told	him	I’d	hoped	to	make	my	own	kind	of	touchdowns	one	day.	And he	shook	my	hand.”	Doug	spoke	as	he	unwrapped	his	burger.	“Eat	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	nodded,	but	was	thinking	about	her	brother-in-law.	“Mike’s	living	the American	dream	himself.	Why	wouldn’t	he	encourage	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug’s	brows	rose,	his	eyes	widened.	“A	career	in	the	arts?	C’mon	Jen.	Most people	couldn’t	imagine	it.	In	fact,	they’d	discourage	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	she’d	always	loved	his	work.	“Forget	about	your	dad.	You’re	proving	him wrong.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	now	I	see	he’s	got	a	point.	There	really	is	no	guarantee	every	show	will	be successful.”	He	gathered	her	hands	into	his	larger	one.	“I’ve	got	to	be	honest here,	Jen.”	His	eyes	darkened;	his	voice	was	intense.	Not	knowing	what	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>expect,	she	took	a	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	scaring	me,	Doug,”	she	began,	her	fingers	pressing	back	against	his. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	always	been	honest	with	me.	So	why	is	today	different?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	cleared	his	throat.	“Today	is	different,”	he	began	slowly,	“because	for	the first	time,	I’m	going	to	New	York	with	you.	I’ve	always	imagined	it	and	now	it’s real.”	Leaning	forward,	he	cupped	her	face	with	his	hands.	“Jennifer	Delaney,	I want	you	in	my	life,	and	I	know	for	that	to	happen—because	of	your	need	for security,	your	need	to	feel	safe—I	must	tell	you	how	I	make	my	living.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	already	told	me	you	were	fine.	I	believed	you.	Shouldn’t	I	have?”	He’d been	open	with	her,	so	she’d	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	fine,	Jen,	stable.	And	plan	to	continue	that	way.	But...you	never	know	for sure.	The	best-laid	plans	and	all	that….	And	I	know	that	will	make	you nervous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	respond,	just	held	her	hand	up	like	a	cop	and	thought	about	his	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	right	about	me,”	she	finally	said.	“I	need	some	control.	But	you	work hard	and	have	common	sense.	I	don’t	think	you’d	let	yourself	starve.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	came	his	laughter,	his	warm,	deep	laughter	that	always	stirred	her	heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only	you	could	come	up	with	that.	I	love	it!	Common	sense	is	what	most people	think	creative	types	 <i class="calibre4">don’t </i>	have.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	chuckled	with	him.	“But	I	know	you	better	than	that,	Doug.	You’re	not	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘type.’	You’re	unique.	At	least,	to	me	you	are.”	From	laughter	to	tears.	She	was on	a	roller-coaster.	“Wh-when	you	left….it	had	absolutely	nothing	to	do	with money	or	earning	a	living	or	anything	like	that.	And—and	as	far	as	I’m concerned,	it	still	doesn’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	suddenly	he	was	on	her	side	of	the	booth,	cradling	her	in	his	arms,	kissing her	all	over	her	cheeks	and	mouth	and	mumbling	things	about	love	and	royalties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	started	to	listen	and	then	to	laugh	again.	His	earnest	explanations	of	royalties earned	on	tickets	sold,	teaching	stints,	writing	ad	copy,	editing	scripts	or	even tending	bar	had	her	amazed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	that’s	the	way	it	works,”	he	offered.	“A	playwright	does	what	he	needs	to	do</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>to	feed	his	habit—writing	new	plays.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you	do	it	all,”	she	said.	“Well,	I	know	one	adjective	that	could	never describe	you,	Doug.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	at	her	in	inquiry.	“Rich?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	she	shook	her	head.	“No!	Lazy.	You’re	not	lazy.	You’re	ambitious.	You’re talented.	And	with	a	little	luck…you’ll	have	it	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	heard	him	inhale	and	looked	up.	“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	he	shook	his	head.	“Ready	to	go?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	hotel	room	was	half	the	size	of	Jen’s	living	room.	The	closet,	the	size	of	a linen	closet	at	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Big	Apple	is	looking	kind	of	small	to	me,”	said	Jen,	scanning	the	room	in	a second.	“Actually,	pretty	tiny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	mid-town	real	estate	—	in	demand	and	scarce.	It’s	only	a	place	to	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’ll	be	out	and	about	most	of	the	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	moved	closer.	“Hey,	I’m	only	teasing.	I	wouldn’t	care	if	we	stayed	in	a	cave as	long	as	you	accomplish	what	you’ve	set	out	to	do.	And	I’m	sure	you	will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stroked	his	cheek,	the	rim	of	his	ear.	“I	believe	in	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyes	darkened,	his	lips	parted,	and	she	was	in	his	arms.	His	mouth	covered hers	as	a	man	starved	for	nourishment	and	she	gave	herself	freely,	gave	herself	to this	one	man	she’d	never	forgotten.	Together,	they	tore	off	the	bedspread	and found	each	other,	undressed	each	other.	Explored	each	other	until	there	was	no more	time,	until	their	pleasure	surged	from	within. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Afterward,	she	couldn’t	move.	“My	limbs	are	like	burst	balloons,”	she whispered.	“Weak.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mine,	too.	It’s	like	the	poet	said	—	a	dream	deferred.	Remember?	Langston Hughes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>“Uh…?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	a	dream	is	deferred	again	and	again…it	will	eventually	explode.	It’s	a perfect	analogy	for	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	rolled	on	his	side	and	turned	her	head	toward	him.	“You	are	the	best	of	me, Jennifer	Delaney.	I’ve	never	stopped	loving	you,	and	this	I	promise	—	no	one will	ever	love	you	more	than	I	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	tears	flowed,	and	he	covered	her	mouth	gently	with	his	fingers.	“You	don’t have	to	say	anything.	Your	heart	still	hasn’t	caught	up	to	that	beautiful	head	of yours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	hated	herself,	she	hated	that	he	was	right.	“You	once	said	you	knew	me better	than	I	know	myself.	Maybe	that’s	why	you	don’t	give	up.	I	did	date	other guys,	Doug,	but…”	She	shook	her	head.	“I	never	got	too	involved.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	were	waiting	for	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	Doug	had	a	huge	romantic	streak.	“Nope.	Sorry.”	She	brushed	back	his usual	hank	of	hair	from	his	forehead,	then	turned	her	face	into	the	pillow.	“I wasn’t	waiting,	Doug.	In	fact,	I	tried	to	forget	you.	Loving	and	losing	is	hard even	when	accepting	half	the	blame,	so	I	sure	wasn’t	ready	to	jump	back	into	the fray	with	someone	else.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	felt	exactly	the	same	way,	Jen.	But	now	I’m	willing	to	fight	for	my	happiness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	about	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">She	put	the	question	behind	her	the	next	day	as	she	made	her	way	to	Radio	City Music	Hall.	Doug	had	told	her	that	morning,	“Go	have	fun.	Be	a	tourist.	Take	a bite	of	the	apple!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	for	goodness	sake.	You	sound	like	a	promo	for	New	York.	You	can	do better	than	that.”	She	waved	and	disappeared,	promising	to	meet	him	back	at	the hotel	by	five. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	ten	minutes,	the	rhythm	of	the	city	crept	into	her	feet.	In	another	ten	minutes, the	cacophony	of	erratic	sounds	became	a	new	musical	fusion.	Car	horns,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>patter	of	feet,	bus	belches,	people’s	voices,	traffic	cop	whistles,	running	motors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	hummed	to	herself	as	she	walked	toward	her	destination,	and	hours	later, was	still	humming	when	she	headed	back	to	the	hotel.	She	heard	the	shower when	she	let	herself	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	home,”	she	called	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Beautiful	words,”	came	the	reply.	“Be	right	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	a	joke!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Home?	Jen	scanned	the	tiny	room,	her	tote	and	purse	now	on	the	desk,	her	shoes off	and	near	the	bed,	a	newspaper	lying	around	on	a	chair	and	Doug’s	belt,	wallet and	sundries	strewn.	Messy,	but	almost	comfortable.	Did	it	feel	like	a	home? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	get	so	dramatic,”	she	mumbled,	stretching	out	on	the	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	appeared	a	minute	later,	wrapped	in	a	towel.	He	leaned	over	and	kissed her.	“So,	tell	me	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	felt	herself	smile	as	she	thought	back.	“I	am	definitely	an	A-1	tourist!	Radio City	was	amazing.	I	even	paid	to	be	part	of	a	small	private	tour.	Rehearsal	halls, dressing	rooms,	even	the	lighting	booth	and	projection	room.	And	the	Art-Deco</p>
<p class="calibre1">—	the	grand	foyer	—	really	deserves	an	Oh-My-God!	And	that’s	what	kept coming	out	of	my	mouth	the	whole	time.	So	much	fun.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep.	You’re	an	A-1	tourist,”	he	began	while	pulling	on	his	pants,	“who	could	be spotted	a	mile	away	with	her	eyes	looking	skyward	instead	of	around	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	stop.	I	was	perfectly	safe.	And	then	I	saw	a	show.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	paused	to	look	at	her.	“Really?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	lucky.	I	stumbled	onto	the	half-price	ticket	booth	for	same	day	shows,	and suddenly,	I	was	Carol	King.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah-h.  <i class="calibre4">Beautiful. </i>	Perfect	choice	for	you.	You’re	sure	beautiful	to	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ignoring	his	compliment,	she	swung	her	legs	over	the	side	of	the	bed	and	stood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	loved	it,	but	‘perfect’	would	have	been	if	you	were	with	me.	I	had	no	one	to share	my	pleasure	with.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>He	kissed	her	once	more.	“Sweetheart,	I	would	have	seen	it	again	just	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure.	I’ve	seen	many	productions.	I	need	to	feel	what’s	out	there,	not	just	read about	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	here	I	thought	writers	sat	in	their	garrets	and	imagined	stuff.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shook	his	head.	“Jennifer,	Jennifer,	Jennifer.	I	expect	more	from	you.	You’ll soon	see	that	we	need	to	live	in	the	real	world	if	we	want	to	connect	with	an audience.	An	audience	is	people!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	waved	and	disappeared	into	bathroom.	“My	turn	in	here.	Oh,	I	forgot	to	ask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	was	your	day?”	God,	she	sounded	like	a	caring	wife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	tell	you	later.	Just	stay	in	your	happy	mood.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Uh-oh.	She	didn’t	like	the	sound	of	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">A	sage	green	sleeveless	dress,	strappy	sandals	and	dangling	earrings.	Jen checked	herself	in	the	bathroom	mirror	and	gave	her	hair	one	last	brush	stroke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Redheads	always	looked	good	in	green,	and	auburn	hair	fell	into	that	category. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ready	for	the	evening,	curious	to	meet	Doug’s	friends,	she	was	satisfied	she’d hold	her	own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	I’m	rea—</p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	on	the	phone	but	looked	up	when	she	spoke.	His	eyes	shone	and	he emitted	a	low	whistle	as	he	talked	back	into	the	receiver.	“Can’t	wait	for	you	to meet	her,	Steve.	And	you’ll	be	my	second	pair	of	ears	at	dinner	with	these producers.”	He	disconnected	and	let	his	gaze	travel	from	her	head	to	her	feet.	“I should	ask	you	to	stay	here	until	showtime.	No	one	will	be	able	to	concentrate on	anything	but	you.	I	know	I	won’t!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	felt	heat	rise	to	her	face—which	had	probably	turned	pink.	Something	that never	happened	at	work	even	after	receiving	a	compliment.	“I	didn’t	want	to	let you	down	—	meeting	your	high-toned	friends	and	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a>“No	more	high-toned	than	we	are,	sweetie.	Except…</p>
<p class="calibre1">She	tilted	her	head	and	waited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">…the	evening	is	turning	into	a	business	meeting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	did	that	happen?”	She	put	up	her	hand.	“No,	don’t	answer.	Let’s	go	back	a bit.	How	was	the	new	lead	for	 <i class="calibre4">The	Broken	Circle? </i>	I	thought	she	was	the	one question	on	your	mind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	real	pro.	She	did	interpret	the	role	a	bit	differently,	but	it	fit.	Staging	a	play	is collaborative,	Jen.	I	had	to	learn	that.	I	thought	the	writer	was	king.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	should	be.	Without	you,	they	have	nothing!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wrapped	his	arms	around	her	and	held	tight.	“It’s	great	having	you	in	my corner,	but	everyone	brings	something	to	the	table.	Today,	the	new	lead	brought her	own	insights	and	emotions.	And	that’s	how	she’ll	make	the	part	hers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got	it.	It’s	interpretation.	Just	like	me	singing	a	song	differently	from	another singer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly.”	He	glanced	at	his	watch.	“Ready	to	go?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	so	fast.	So	why	is	dinner	turning	into	a	business	meeting?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stepped	back	and	started	to	pace.	“Two	producers	are	joining	us	for	the	meal and	to	see	 <i class="calibre4">The	Broken	Circle— </i> again.	They’re	brothers,	and	they	like	my	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I-I	was	really	productive	during	my	residency	here,	and	they	kept	their	eyes	on some	of	us.”	He	pivoted	to	her	and	stood	still.	“They’ve	got	some	strong	backers</p>
<p class="calibre1">—investors—	and	might	be	coming	to	Boston	to	see	 <i class="calibre4">The	Sanctuary.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sucker-punched.	Her	brain	went	into	overdrive,	and	she	swallowed	hard.	“So we’ve	been	living	in	make-believe	land.”	She	pulled	a	tissue	from	the	dispenser and	balled	it	in	her	hand.	“It’s	happening	again.	Boston,	New	York.	It	always comes	back	to	choices.	Been	there,	done	that.”	She	pointed	to	him,	then	to herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	true.	My	home	is	in	Boston	with	you.	Nothing’s	changed.	As	you	like	to remind	me,	I	can	write	anywhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>But	he’d	said	staging	a	play	was	a	collaboration.	And	building	his	career	seemed all	about	relationships.	Actors,	producers,	directors.	Producers	were	critical—</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	brought	the	money	people.	New	York	City,	she	had	to	concede,	was	the mecca	for	this	whole	gang. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">And	he’d	walked	away	from	it—for	her! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	she	needed	the	tissue	to	blot	her	face,	but	her	face	was	against	Doug’s	shirt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	going	to	love	 <i class="calibre4">The	Sanctuary,” </i>	she	said	between	hiccups. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	as	much	as	I	love	you,	Jen,”	he	said,	his	voice	hoarse.	“Don’t	you	know that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	did.	She	really	did.	She’d	felt	his	love	for	her	every	day,	but	hadn’t	trusted it.	Hadn’t	trusted	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	your	career….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	figure	it	out.	Okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	tears	rolled	faster	as	she	held	him	tight.	“I’ve	missed	you	so	much,	my	love. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	have	to	figure	it	out	because	I	can’t	lose	you	again.”	She	leaned	back	and cupped	his	face	with	her	hands.	“I	love	you,	Douglas	Collins.	I-I	wasn’t	ready back	then,	but	now…I	think	you’re	right.	How	hard	can	it	be?	After	all,	New York’s	almost	next	door	to	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">She	liked	Steve	Kantor	immediately.	She	felt	comfortable	with	him,	as	if	they’d known	each	other	for	a	long	time.	He	sat	on	one	side	of	her	with	Doug	on	the other,	at	the	round	table	in	a	nearby	Italian	restaurant.	Maybe	it	was	the	man’s easy	manner,	maybe	it	was	because	he	had	Doug’s	best	interests	in	mind.	Or maybe	it	was	because	he’d	let	her	know	that	Italian	cooking	was	his	favorite, just	as	it	was	hers.	Whatever	the	reasons,	she	was	glad	he	was	Doug’s	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doug	told	me	you’ve	never	met	a	number	you	didn’t	like,”	said	Steve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled	and	sipped	her	wine.	“Not	quite.	I	don’t	like	those	red	ones	on	a bottom	line.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>He	shot	a	look	at	Doug.	“Oh,	she’s	good.	Very	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	reason	why	I	keep	her	around,”	Doug	replied,	his	eyes	gleaming	at	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Enough,”	she	said.	“I	think	we’re	getting	company.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	stood	as	the	two	producers	joined	them.	Steve	rose,	too.	Greetings	were exchanged	while	Doug	made	introductions	to	the	Silverman	brothers—Alan	and Jeff.	The	had	quick	smiles	and	outstretched	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	looking	forward	to	seeing	your	play	again,”	said	Alan,	the	taller	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	your	work,”	added	Jeff.	“I	judged	a	lot	of	contests	for	Playwrights’</p>
<p class="calibre1">House—still	do—and	you	always	scored	in	the	top	2.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	turned	to	Jen.	“Are	you	familiar	with	the	one-act	he	has	running	off-Broadway?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	about	it,”	Jen	replied	slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	that	started	as	a	student	project.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pride	bubbled	inside	her,	and	she	leaned	forward.	“And	then	he	improved	it	until it	got	noticed.	Doug’s	the	best,”	she	gushed,	unable	to	stop	herself.	“His	words come	from	his	heart	and	his	head.	And	the	audience	gets	it.	They	walk	away standing	a	little	taller,	feeling	more	fulfilled.	They	see	the	world	in	a	new	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	a	lawyer?”	asked	Alan,	seeming	genuinely	curious,	and	breaking	the silence	that	followed	Jen’s	impulsive	speech. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heat	rose	to	her	face	as	she	shook	her	head.	“That	would	be	my	sister.	She’s	the smart	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	hooted.	“Don’t	let	her	fool	you.	The	five	of	them—the	Delaneys—were born	whip-smart.”	He	tucked	her	hand	in	his.	“But	I	got	the	best	of	the	bunch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh-ho!	So	that’s	the	way	it	is,”	replied	the	producer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	is	the	way	it	is,”	said	Doug,	quietly	and	with	emphasis.	“Come	up	to Boston	in	September,	and	you’ll	see	her	again.	Dinner	in	the	North	End.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a>best	Italian	food	in	the	world.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	placing	orders	with	their	server,	the	conversation	became	all	business.	The plot,	the	actors,	the	creative	team	of	 <i class="calibre4">The	Sanctuary. </i>	Doug	would	be	hands-on through	the	run. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">If </i>	it	runs	the	whole	eight	weeks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen’s	fork	stopped	halfway	to	her	mouth.	She	placed	it	back	on	her	plate	and avoiding	Doug’s	eyes,	focused	on	the	once-amiable	Alan	Silverman,	who’d asked	about	her	law	skills. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	will,”	she	said	with	confidence.	“I’m	extremely	familiar	with	the Commonwealth	Theater.	I	know	the	audiences.	I	know	the	people	of	Boston. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Patrons	come	from	all	over	the	area.	One	month’s	run	would	be	minimal.	Two months	will	happen.	Besides,”	she	added,	“my	understanding	is	that	the	theater’s literary	management	had	no	trouble	funding	the	show.	It’s	that	good!”	She leaned	back	in	her	chair.	“But,	as	always,	everyone’s	taste	is	different,	and	you’ll have	to	judge	for	yourselves.”	She	looked	from	one	to	the	other.	“I	promise	you a	warm	welcome	to	my	adopted	hometown.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	she’s	not	a	lawyer,	she	shudda	been…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	producer	glanced	at	Doug.	“You’re	one	lucky	s.o.b.	She’s	riding	shotgun	for you.	And	sticking	close.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	noticed,”	Doug	said	wryly.	But	although	he	smiled,	he	didn’t	look	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several	hours	later,	all	concerns	disappeared	as	the	audience	viewing	 <i class="calibre4">The	Broken</i> <i class="calibre4">Circle </i>	got	to	its	feet,	acknowledging	the	cast	with	long,	sustained	applause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tears	ran	down	Jen’s	face,	a	mix	of	grief	and	hope	as	she	relished	the	satisfying ending.	And	she	wondered	how	the	new	lead	could	possibly	be	better	than	the woman	in	the	cast	now.	Fortunately,	it	wasn’t	her	problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	maybe	it	was.	If	she	and	Doug	were	a	real	unit,	they	had	to	have	each	other’s backs.	At	least,	that’s	what	she’d	noticed	about	Mike	and	Lisa.	It	made	sense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen,	Doug	and	the	other	three	men	walked	slowly	to	the	theater	lobby.	“I	loved the	college	production,”	said	Jen,	turning	toward	Doug,	“I	cried	then	too—	but this!	It’s	so	much	better	than	my	memories.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>“Because	the	script	was	brought	to	life	by	professionals,”	said	Steve.	“Good actors	can	make	anything	sound	great,	but	they	can’t	turn	a	sow’s	ear	into	a	silk purse.”	He	turned	to	Doug	and	clapped	him	on	the	shoulder.	“You	are	one talented	son	of	a	gun,	with	an	understanding	of	the	human	condition	that	seems beyond	your	years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks.	Thank	you	all,”	said	Doug,	including	the	other	two	men,	“I	may	look young	on	the	outside,	but	inside…?	My	mom	says	I	have	an	old	soul.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is	that	why	he’d	been	able	to	see	through	her	defenses	years	ago?	Is	that	what gave	him	the	confidence	to	come	back	without	any	promise	from	her? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	impressed,”	said	Jeff	Silverman.	“I	won’t	say	otherwise.	Tell	your	mom she	raised	a	gifted	son.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alan	shook	Doug’s	hand.	“We’ll	come	to	Boston	to	see	the	new	play,	but	we’ll be	calling	you	tomorrow	about	this	one.	We	have	another	idea.	The	drama, <i class="calibre4">Doubt, </i>	played	on	Broadway	for	a	year	and	a	half.	Your	play	is	still	going	strong after	two	years.	Now’s	the	time	to	take	it	on	tour.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	saw	Doug’s	eyes	widen,	his	brows	lift.	He’d	been	concentrating	so	hard	on <i class="calibre4">The	Sanctuary, </i>	this	possibility	for	 <i class="calibre4">The	Broken	Circle </i>	had	taken	him	by surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	lots	of	questions,	and	her	fingers	itched	for	a	calculator.	Her	work	was cut	out	for	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	11</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	hoisted	their	overnight	bags	and	put	them	into	the	trunk,	then	settled himself	behind	the	wheel	of	his	car.	He	glanced	at	Jen.	“Seat	belt	on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	she	replied	with	a	yawn.	“Can’t	believe	I’m	sleepy	on	a	Sunday afternoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	could	believe	it.	She’d	been	on	the	go	non-stop	since	they’d	arrived	on Thursday	and	had	been	up	late	the	evening	before	with	her	mind	working overtime.	“I’m	told	that	being	a	tourist	can	be	an	exhausting	occupation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	grinned.	“I	loved	that	part.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	felt	her	hand	on	his	arm	and	turned	toward	her.	“Forgot	something	upstairs?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope,	but	I	have	a	question.	Why	were	you	annoyed	with	me	last	night?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	she’d	noticed.	“For	one	thing,	you	sounded	like	my	mother,	bragging	about her	boy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what?	The	only	thing	your	mother	and	I	have	in	common	is	that	we	both love	you…	Oh,	I	see.	Embarrassing.	I’ll	give	you	that.	However---I	know	from experience	that	it’s	hard	to	brag	about	yourself	without	sounding	like	a	total egotist.	Therefore,	you	were	lucky	to	have	me	around.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quick	answer,	quick	mind.	And	turning	defense	into	offense.	He	waited	to	start the	ignition.	“Alan	Silverman	was	right.	You	should	have	been	a	lawyer.	And what	was	that	bit	about	the	Commonwealth’s	literary	management?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	nothing	about	that.	And	it	sounded	like	the	start	of	a	negotiation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keep	out	of	it.	I	can	negotiate	for	myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	that	would	be	a	mistake	for	him.	“No,	you	can’t.	Even	Mike	doesn’t.	And Lisa	says	anyone	negotiating	on	their	own	has	a	fool	for	a	client.”	Jen	twisted	in her	seat.	“Don’t	drive	off	yet.	Just	listen	to	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	listening.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>“You	know	how	I	am	about	not	liking	nasty	surprises.	I	did	my	research	at	home on-line.	A	play	doesn’t	get	produced	regionally	without	backing	from	the theater’s	literary	management.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Research?	If	you	wanted	to	know	something,	why	didn’t	you	just	ask	me? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don’t	you	trust	me	with	the	answers?	With	the	truth?”	He	heard	the	dismay	in his	own	voice.	Back	to	trust.	The	one	subject	that	could	pierce	his	heart.	“There are	always	uphill	battles.	Success	doesn’t	come	without	financial	risk.”	Funny, she’d	never	asked	about	his	personal	finances,	and	he’d	kept	discussions	about his	earnings	pretty	general. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doug,	I’m	sorry…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	started	the	car	and	began	to	drive,	but	before	Jen	finished,	his	phone	rang. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	probably	the	Silverman	Brothers,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Put	the	phone	on	speaker,”	Jen	requested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	way.”	Jen	was	smart,	but	this	business	conversation	was	 <i class="calibre4">his </i>	business.	Not hers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	just	that	two	sets	of	ears	are	better	than	one,”	she	said.	“Like	in	a	doctor’s office.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	I	know	is	that	you’re	a	terrier.	I’ll	do	it	because	I’m	behind	the	wheel,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said	Doug,	heading	toward	the	street,	“but	try	to	stay	quiet.	Don’t	insert	any more	‘research’	into	the	conversation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry	if	I	stepped	on	your	toes.	But	as	the	man	said	last	night,	I’m	riding shotgun	for	you.	Business	is	business.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	glared	at	her	and	connected	the	call.	Then	saw	her	reach	into	her	purse	and pull	out	a	pad	and	pen.	Geez,	she	was	taking	notes.	It	was	so	like	Jen,	he	started to	laugh.	What	did	he	expect? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	didn’t	expect	a	tour	of	six	cities,	possible	dates,	lots	of	money	put	up	by investors.	The	producers	would	hire	a	director	and	cast	out	of	New	York. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	like	what	I	hear	so	far,”	said	Doug.	“Can	we	continue	this	discussion tomorrow	when	I’m	behind	the	desk	and	not	behind	the	wheel?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>“You’ve	got	it,”	came	the	voice	from	the	speaker.	“And	we’ll	work	up	some figures	for	you	to	consider.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	always	that!”	quipped	Doug.	“Writers	need	to	make	a	living.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	call	went	silent,	and	in	the	car,	Doug	felt	only	his	own	racing	heartbeat	as the	magnitude	of	the	conversation	hit	him.	He	made	a	conscious	effort	to	focus on	traffic	and	allow	his	breathing	to	return	to	his	normal	rhythm.	More possibilities	than	he	could	imagine	had	just	been	thrown	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	bit	overwhelming,	isn’t	it?”	asked	Jen	quietly.	“Want	to	pull	over	for	a few	minutes	and	just	take	it	all	in?”	He	looked	around	and	wondered	where	on earth	he	could	do	that.	They	were	still	trying	to	make	their	way	out	of Manhattan.	She	must	have	noticed,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	never	mind,	Doug.	Just	drive.	You’ll	absorb	the	shock—or	should	I	say,	the shockingly	good	news.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	count	chickens.	Two	months	ago,	I	had	no	idea	something	like	this	would happen,”	he	said,	continuing	to	make	his	way	toward	the	West	Side	Highway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	think—I	think	true	opportunity	is	presenting	itself,	and	I’d	be	foolish	not to	follow	through.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	totally	agree,”	Jen	commented.	“Go	for	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	she	didn’t	understand	the	true	nature	of	the	business.	If	she	judged	from	only this	fortunate	episode,	it	would	give	a	false	impression.	“Listen	up,	Jen.	I’m going	to	be	straight	with	you.	I	work	in	a	fickle	business.	You	have	to	make	hay while	the	sun	shines	and	all	those	other	trite	sayings.”	But	nothing	was	trite about	the	business.	Deals	were	made	or	broken.	Dreams	were	shattered	on	a whim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Taking	advantage	of	an	opportunity	is	totally	logical,”	Jen	said.	“I’ve	seen	in business	that	some	people	actually	fear	success	and	turn	their	backs	on	it.	But you’re	not	one	of	them.	You	work	harder	than	ten	people.	I-I	think	you	were born	to	do	this.	Your	stories	are	wonderful.	So,	I’m	okay	with	your	‘fickle business.’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	she	were	any	other	woman,	he’d	totally	buy	in.	But	she	was	Jennifer	Delaney, whose	best	friend	was	a	calculator.	“Who	are	you	kidding?”	he	asked.	“You	like</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a>to	plan.	You	balance	your	checkbook.	You	budget	to	the	last	dollar.	My	plans fluctuate.	You	can’t	trust	them	from	month	to	month,	season	to	season.	My income	fluctuates,	too.	Unless	something	fantastical	happens,	I’ll	never	be successful	the	way	your	brother-in-law	is.	And	that’s	the	truth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even	Mike	has	no	guarantee	from	season	to	season,”	said	Jen.	“Injuries	can happen.	He’s	getting	older.	Did	you	know	that	Lisa	used	to	cover	her	eyes	during a	game	—	for	at	least	half	the	time?	She’d	be	happy	if	he	ran	a	pharmacy	like	his brother!	He	was	a	science	major	in	college,	in	addition	to	playing	football.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	whistled	softly.	“I	never	knew	any	of	that.	He’s	living	every	boy’s	dream.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	living	his	own	dream,”	she	said,	“just	like	you.”	She	turned	in	her	seat,	her fingers	tapping	against	her	leg.	“I’ve	been	thinking	hard,	Doug.	I’ve	looked, listened	and	tried	to	consider	every	angle	I	could.	In	the	end,	after	this	year passes	and	with	being	in	such	demand,	I	think	you’re	going	to	have	to	be	where the	action	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence	filled	the	car.	“Maybe.	Maybe	not,”	he	replied,	keeping	his	tone	even.	He would	not	accept	a	déjà	vu	experience	from	her.	“What	are	you	trying	to	tell me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Living	in	New	York	is	expensive,	but	living	in	two	places	is	outrageous.	So how	are	we	planning	to	be	in	two	cities	at	once?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	loved	the	sweet	sound	of	“we.”	The	woman	could	make	his	head	spin,	put her	nose	where	it	didn’t	belong,	and	frustrate	him	almost	to	death,	but	she	was on	his	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	hear	what	you	said,	my	sweet	Henny-Penny?”	he	asked.	“Are	you	with me	all	the	way	this	time?	All	the	way	into	the	future?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	her	computer	the	next	morning,	Jen	took	a	deep	breath	and	began	her day.	A	normal	day.	Checking	her	appointment	list,	planning	strategies	for	her clients	and	settling	into	and	enjoying	her	familiar	routine.	The	weekend’s	events had	to	take	a	back	seat	now,	which	was	almost	too	bad.	She	could	still	see Doug’s	smile	in	her	mind’s	eye	after	she’d	answered	his	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>“Knock,	knock,”	rang	out	a	familiar	voice.	“I	can’t	wait	another	second	longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	was	New	York?	And	don’t	tell	me	I’ll	be	losing	another	friend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	waved	at	Alexis,	standing	in	the	doorway.	“A	whirlwind.	We	were	constantly on	the	go.	But	don’t	worry	about	losing	me!	Doug	knows	Boston’s	my	home.	If you’re	free	for	lunch,	I	can	fill	you	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	got	it.”	Alexis	waved	and	was	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	phone	rang.	Jen	saw	Lisa’s	name	on	the	readout.	“Hey,	I	only	have	a	minute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	are	the	babes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	for	dinner	tonight	and	see	for	yourself.	I’m	feeling	a	lot	better	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wonderful,	Lis.	See	you	later.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	her	meals	became	focal	points,	she’d	gain	ten	pounds	in	no	time.	Shaking	her head	and	grinning	to	herself,	Jen	tried	once	again	to	review	her	first	client’s portfolio. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	next	phone	call	came	an	hour	later,	just	after	her	first	client	had	left	but before	her	next	one	arrived.	This	time	the	display	showed	the	name	of	her supervisor.	She	picked	up	the	receiver	and	inked	in	a	meeting	at	the	end	of	the day	before	texting	Lisa	about	being	late	that	night.	And	then	wondered	what	to expect	from	her	boss.	She	was	curious,	but	not	too	worried.	She	and	the department	head	had	a	good,	respectful	relationship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instinct	prevented	her	from	mentioning	her	appointment	to	Alexis	when	they	ate lunch.	Instead,	she	just	raved	about	Radio	City	and	seeing	Doug’s	play.	“It	really is	wonderful,	Lex.	And	I’m	not	the	only	one	raving	about	Doug.	You	should have	heard	the	audience’s	applause.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I	did,”	replied	her	friend	with	a	straight	face.	“And	I	never	left	Boston!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	hooted	with	laughter.	“I	have	it	bad,	huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alexis	remained	quiet	for	a	moment,	then	tilted	her	head	and	peered	at	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	I	think	you	do	have	it	bad,	but	is	that	good?	Doug’s	a	nice	guy,	Jen.	We all	like	him.	And	I	know	it’s	not	my	business,	but	you’ve	got	some	history together.	I	saw	your	reaction	when	he	showed	up	out	of	the	blue.	What	was	it? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a>Only	five	or	six	weeks	ago?	It’s	happening	kind	of	fast,	don’t	you	think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	stomach	tensed.	She	broke	eye	contact	and	looked	away.	“I	know	his	soul,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	said	softy,	“and	that’s	enough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence	beat	against	her	ears	for	a	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	I’m	sorry,”	said	Alexis.	“You’re	my	friend	and	I	care	about	you.	I	just don’t	want	you	to	be	hurt	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fair	enough.	“Don’t	worry	about	me.	I	even	know	how	he	earns	a	living	in	that crazy,	creative	business.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	then!	That’s	great.	I	hope	he’s	managed	to	save	some	of	those	royalties.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly,	the	practical,	formidable,	and	financially	astute	Jennifer	Delaney realized	she’d	never	even	asked	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Brianna	looks	wonderful!	I	bet	she	gained	a	whole	pound	over	the	weekend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	reached	for	the	baby,	happy	to	see	Lisa’s	beaming	expression	and	Mike’s welcome	smile,	and	bubbling	inside	with	good	news	to	share	with	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Glad	to	see	you,	Jenny,”	said	Mike.	“We	could	use	another	adult	around	here, even	for	a	short	visit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mike!	I’m	doing	fine	now,”	protested	his	wife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	let	Jenny	be	the	judge,”	he	said,	turning	toward	Jen.	“Finally,	Lisa’s agreed	to	your	idea	of	a	night	nurse	coming	in	for	a	while,	and	we’ve	made	some calls.	We’ll	have	help	starting	tomorrow	night	for	however	long	it	takes	our	little girl	to	stop	getting	her	timing	mixed	up!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	looked	harder	at	her	sister.	Underneath	the	smile	and	the	makeup,	dark circles	hid	around	her	eyes.	“You	need	to	get	back	to	yourself,	Lis,	and	nothing does	that	as	well	as	a	good	night’s	sleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	sound	like	a	TV	ad	for	sleeping	pills	or	something,”	grumbled	Lisa. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>Maybe	she	did.	So	what?	“Just	telling	you	the	truth.	Besides,	Bobby	needs	a mom	who	can	run	around	with	him,	don’t	you,	sweetheart?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yup.	But	I	got	you	and	Daddy.	He	runs	fast,	but	he	can’t	catch	me.”	The	little boy	took	off	down	the	hall,	with	Mike	pacing	himself	in	pursuit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	a	good	dad,”	said	Jen.	“But	the	action	never	really	stops,	does	it?”	Her glance	traveled	down	to	the	baby,	and	she	leaned	in	and	inhaled.	“Ooh,	that	baby aroma.	Brianna	smells	so	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	you’ve	got	the	right	end.”	Lisa	smiled	quickly	before	sinking	into	a kitchen	chair.	“I’ve	ordered	pizza.	Not	a	great	dinner,	but	that’s	what	we’re having.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	complaints,”	said	Jen.	“I	just	wanted	to	visit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	glad	you’re	here.	I-I	am	a	bit	concerned.	Mike’s	pre-season	is	around	the corner,	and	then,	a	new	NFL	season	starts	the	beginning	of	September.	He’ll	be gone	half	the	time,	and	Brianna’s	so	much	harder	than	Bobby	was.	It	takes almost	an	entire	hour	to	feed	her.	I	get	scared	just	thinking	about	it	all.	And	then my	career.	But	I	need	to	get	back	to	work	or	I’ll	have	to	start	building	a	practice all	over	again.	I	don’t	know	how	I’ll	handle	everything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jennifer	shivered,	then	breathed	deeply.	Her	strong	sister	needed	some	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen’s	weekend	with	Doug	seemed	like	a	million	years	ago.	And	the	recent conversation	with	her	boss	that	had	netted	a	promotion	for	her…	was	not something	to	bring	up	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa	reached	for	her	hand,	and	Jen	met	her	gaze.	“I	wish	—	oh,	how	I	wish	Mom and	Dad	were	still	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen’s	eyes	closed.	Tears	threatened,	but	she	swallowed	them.	Was	there	a	time limit	on	grief?	Commiseration	was	not	what	Lisa	needed	right	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	all	do,	Lisa.	But	they’re	not.	So,	listen	to	me.”	Maybe	her	tone	of	voice	did the	trick,	but	her	sister	remained	quiet,	waiting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hate	to	say	this,”	Jen	began,	“but	sometimes	you’re	your	own	worst	enemy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	glad	the	nurse	will	be	here	tomorrow,	but	with	all	the	demands	on	you, you’ll	need	more	help.	Mike’s	parents	can’t	live	with	you.	They	still	work,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>besides,	they	have	lives	of	their	own.”	She	took	a	breath	and	slowly	said,	“You can’t	fight	the	idea	anymore.	You	need	to	hire	a	nanny.	A	good	one	this	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa’s	horrified	expression	said	it	all.	“Another	one	who	won’t	work	out? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nannies,	schmannies!	Besides,	I	-	I’m	not	a	society	lady!	We	don’t	come	from that	world,	no	matter	how	much	my	husband	earns.	Mom	raised	five	by	herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	I’m	having	trouble	with	two.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	the	baby	in	one	arm,	Jen	wrapped	her	other	around	her	sibling.	“You’re	not thinking	straight,	and	you	don’t	have	to	do	anything	right	now	except	get	some sleep.	All	those	hormones	are	going	wacky	inside	you.	That’s	what	all	this	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	hoped	her	babble	was	on	target. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	you’re	right,”	said	Lisa,	seemingly	in	control	once	more.	“Mike	says	the same	thing.	And	I	still	have	some	time.	In	another	two	months,	Brianna	will have	figured	out	night	from	day,	and	we’ll	all	get	some	sleep.”	She	smiled	a genuine	smile,	and	Jen	relaxed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	start	with	the	nurse,	and	then	we’ll	see,”	continued	Lisa.	“I’m	so	glad	you live	nearby,	Jen.	What	would	I	do	without	my	backup	quarterback?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	forced	a	wide	smile.	For	the	very	first	time	in	her	life,	being	so	needed	by her	family	left	her	with	a	sinking	feeling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	would	have	told	her	about	our	weekend,	but	really,	she	had	all	she	could	do	to keep	from	crying	while	I	was	there.”	Jen	lay	back	on	her	pillows,	phone	to	her ear,	glad	to	share	her	evening	with	Doug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Phew!	I	have	absolutely	no	experience	with	this	stuff,”	he	said.	“I	guess	you just	have	to	punt.	See	what	I	mean	about	our	imperfect	world?	Always	a	mixed bag.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	good,	the	bad	and	the	ugly.	I	suppose	so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only	suppose?	Your	promotion	is	fantastic,	Jen.	Team	Leader,	soon	to	be Branch	Manager.	Fantastic!	Too	bad	you	couldn’t	share	your	good	news	with your	family.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>“Yes,	but	everyone	at	work	will	know	when	the	memo	goes	out	tomorrow.	I’m	a little	nervous.	I	hope	there’s	no	backlash	from	the	other	consultants.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ll	get	over	it.	There’s	competition	in	every	field.	Enjoy	the	win.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	felt	herself	smile.	“You’re	right.	And	now	you’re	riding	shotgun	for	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Always.	I’m	not	going	anywhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	going	everywhere!	At	least	your	plays	are.	Six	cities?”	she	teased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	signing	a	good	deal	with	the	Silverman	brothers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	ask	for	a	share	of	box	office?	Even	a	small	percentage?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jen-ni-fer…”	a	slight	warning	note	lined	his	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	looking	out	for	you,”	she	said,	“so	get	used	to	it.	I	did	more	research,	and	I take	care	of	my	peeps.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	who	takes	care	of	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	question	hit	with	a	force	she	couldn’t	have	anticipated.	The	Delaneys	took care	of	each	other.	Always	had.	But	the	foundation	was	shifting.	Lisa	and	Mike were	a	unit,	and	the	go-to	people	for	her	sibs.	Jennifer	was	on	her	own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Independent,	competent.	Available	to	help	when	needed,	but	at	day’s	end,	alone in	her	apartment.	She	scanned	the	room,	her	gaze	swerving	downward.	Alone	in her	bed,	too.  <i class="calibre4">So	who	did	take	care	of	her? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	be	continued	at	another	time,”	she	said	softly,	before	hanging	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’d	considered	them	a	team.	They’d	talked	about	a	future,	but	had	no	concrete plans	yet.	Was	it	too	soon? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doubts	crept	into	her	mind.	He’d	never	really	shared	his	financial	status	with her.	Those	vague	description	of	the	playwrights’	ups	and	downs	didn’t	count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had	he	been	able	to	save	any	money	in	New	York?	And	he	certainly	didn’t	want her	input	about	business	decisions.	She	didn’t	like	secrets,	couldn’t	live	with them,	and	she’d	tell	him	just	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>She	shut	the	lights	and	closed	her	eyes,	only	to	sit	straight	up	again.	Doug	was not	the	only	person	keeping	secrets.	She	hadn’t	shared	one	financial	detail	of	her own	success	with	him	either.	The	realization	stunned	her.	She	fluffed	up	her pillow	and	slowly	lay	down	again.	Maybe	they’d	miscommunicated	and	were	at a	stalemate.	Or	maybe	it	was	a	matter	of	trust.	She	sighed.	It	seemed	always	to come	back	to	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	12</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">My	dearest	Doug	—	We	enjoyed	meeting	Jennifer	very	much	and	would	like	to</i> <i class="calibre4">spend	more	time	with	you	both.	As	you	asked,	I’ve	enclosed	Grandma’s	emerald</i> <i class="calibre4">ring	with	the	highest	hopes	that	you	and	Jennifer	will	be	as	happy	as	your</i> <i class="calibre4">grandparents	were.	Grandma	believed	the	ring	brought	her	luck!	I	think	her	luck</i> <i class="calibre4">was	in	meeting	Grandpa.	I’ll	be	waiting	for	updates	on	your	romance.	Please</i> <i class="calibre4">call	to	let	me	know	the	ring	arrived	safely. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Love	always, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Mom</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">P.S.	I	had	it	cleaned	before	I	mailed	it. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	smiled	at	his	mom’s	postscript	and	felt	the	warmth	of	her	presence	from miles	away.	He	held	the	ring	up	to	the	light,	examining	it	from	all	angles	and hoping	Jen	would	find	it	as	beautiful	as	he	did.	He	remembered	his	grandmother wearing	it	all	the	time	and	saying	that	someday	Doug	would	pass	it	on	to	his bride.	Evie,	she’d	said,	would	want	a	symbol	from	her	own	husband	in	that	far-off	future.	Well,	his	someday	had	arrived,	and	his	real	future	would	start	now,	if he	could	figure	out	the	right	time	and	place	to	propose.	She	wasn’t	getting	away this	time! </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	romantic	setting	for	sure.	Maybe	in	Boston	Gardens,	or	on	a	cruise	in	the harbor.	Or	maybe	a	fun	day	at	the	beach	way	out	on	Cape	Cod.	Behind	a	sand dune	would	provide	some	privacy.	He	wanted	to	come	up	with	someplace special	and	memorable	even	when	they	looked	back	in	fifty	years.	Nodding	to himself,	he	placed	the	ring	into	his	top	drawer.	A	safe	place	until	it	rested	on Jen’s	finger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	sat	back	down	at	his	computer,	reviewed	the	last	two	acts	of	 <i class="calibre4">Straight	From</i> <i class="calibre4">the	Heart </i>	and	sent	it	to	Steve.	His	only	novel	was	now	a	complete	play.	His buddy	had	seen	the	book	version,	so	now	he’d	have	a	chance	to	comment	on	the stage	version. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>He	ticked	off	the	items	on	his	project	list.	Rehearsals	for	 <i class="calibre4">The	Sanctuary </i>	were going	well.	He’d	made	some	good	additions	to	his	new	playwriting	curriculum for	the	university,	and	had	bought	a	plane	ticket	to	New	York	to	see	the	new actress	in	her	opening	night	of	 <i class="calibre4">The	Broken	Circle. </i>	Picking	up	the	phone,	he called	his	mom	about	receiving	the	jewelry.	To	his	surprise,	she	promptly announced	plans	to	visit	Boston	the	following	weekend	—	the	Fourth	of	July. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	overnight.	Eve	has	a	rare	day	off	before	the	holiday,	and	we	thought	we’d see	both	of	you—and	Jennifer,	too.”	His	mom’s	excitement	seemed	mixed	with anxiety. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	sure	Eve	wouldn’t	rather	sleep?”	he	teased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	joke.	I’m	actually	concerned	that	she	will.	Those	residents	have	a	hard life.	They	really	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	loves	it,	Mom,	but	I’m	sure	she’ll	look	forward	to	a	little	break	with	you and	Dad.	So	where	are	you	staying?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	that	might	be	a	problem,”	she	said	slowly.	“Boston’s	brimming	with tourists	next	weekend,	and	we’re	last	minute.	I’ve	found	nothing	available	yet, and	I’ve	made	many	calls.	If	my	bad	luck	continues,	I-I	thought	we	could	bunk in	with	you	for	one	night.	Eve	has	only	a	sofa.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	that	sofa	well.”	It	wasn’t	a	convertible	one.	He	shrugged	and	offered	his apartment,	then	thanked	her	again	for	sending	the	ring.	After	disconnecting,	he texted	Jen	and	got	back	to	working	on	the	curriculum.	She’d	call	when	she	had time.	Her	promotion	had	come	with	additional	responsibilities	to	go	along	with the	additional	salary,	including	supervising	her	entire.	department. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	gone	up	to	her	office	once	when	she	was	working	late.	Standing	in	the doorway,	he’d	watched,	listened	and	admired	her	as	she	talked	with	clients	on the	phone.	A	perfect	fit	in	her	professional	world.	Some	people	might	think	he and	Jen	had	nothing	in	common,	but	they’d	be	wrong.	The	theater	was	a business,	too.	Mutual	respect	for	each	other’s	efforts	ranked	high	with	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	phone	rang,	bringing	him	back	to	the	present.	“Are	you	up	for	another	round with	my	folks?”	he	asked	without	preamble.	“It’s	really	about	Eve…Yeah,	I’m sure.	I’m	thinking	dinner	and	a	nice	walk	with	a	hundred	thousand	others	to	the Esplanade	for	the	Pops	concert.	And	I’ll	need	to	stay	at	your	place	that	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a>He	laughed	at	her	response.	Sleeping	at	Jen’s	was	the	easy	part. </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	her	apartment	a	few	evenings	later,	Jen	placed	her	cell	phone	on	an	end	table in	her	living	room	and	looked	at	Doug,	stretched	out	on	the	sofa.	“Lisa	and	Mike want	to	join	us	tomorrow	for	dinner.	We	need	to	let	them	know	where	and when.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With	the	kids?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	felt	a	genuine	smile	emerge.	“Uh-uh.	She’s	actually	happy	with	the	nurse they	hired.	I	hope	the	woman	stays	forever.	Or	that	they	hire	a	nanny	again.	Lisa sounds	so	much	more	relaxed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	let	the	fun	begin!”	said	Doug.	“But	you’d	better	tell	Mike	to	wear	a baseball	cap…if	he	wants	some	privacy.	Bostonians	know	their	QB.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	waved	his	words	aside.	“No	problem.	The	fans	here	are	used	to	seeing	him around	town.	He	waves,	nods	and	they	leave	him	alone.	He’s	got	the	whole	thing worked	out	so	he	and	Lisa	can	live	like	regular	people—sort	of.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Regular	people	with	a	limo?”	he	quipped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	walked	over	and	sat	at	the	edge	of	the	cushion	next	to	him,	then	brushed	the lock	of	hair	from	his	face.	“Going	out	to	dinner	is	a	no-brainer	at	other	times,	but I’m	wondering	why	they	want	to	join	us	now.	With	all	the	tourists	in	town,	it	will be	a	madhouse	wherever	we	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	studied	her	for	a	long	moment	before	saying,	“They	think	you’re	worth	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you….”	The	coin	dropped.	“Oh.	They	want	to	meet	your	family.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bingo.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shrugged.	“It’s	not	necessary.	I	already	know	what	I’m	dealing	with.”	She gave	him	a	quick	kiss	on	the	cheek.	“It	could	be	worse.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	brows	hiked	up	so	high,	she	thought	they’d	touch	the	ceiling.	Then	he	pulled her	in	for	a	kiss.	“You	never	know	with	my	father.	Let’s	just	wait	and	see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>She	saw	the	doubts,	a	lifetime	of	hurt	feelings,	of	perhaps	being	second-best.	“It doesn’t	matter	anymore,	Doug.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	talking	about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	parents…Eve…history…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	girlfriend.	I	only	care	how	they	treat	you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	wrapped	her	arms	around	him,	snuggled	against	his	chest.	“Love	you,	Doug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	a	big	girl	and	I’ll	be	fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	like	sardines	in	a	can,”	grumbled	Doug’s	dad	as	they	made	their	way through	Faneuil	Hall	Marketplace,	the	refurbished	area	of	restaurants,	food	stalls and	specialties,	and	probably	the	most	popular	tourist	spot	in	town.	“We’ll	never get	a	table	anywhere	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	don’t	have	to,”	said	Doug.	“Jen	managed	a	reservation	at	Maguires,	our usual	place.	With	the	city	overflowing,	she	pulled	a	string	or	two.	Now,	we	only wanted	to	show	you	around	a	bit.	Can’t	you	relax	and	just	enjoy	yourselves?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	looked	from	Doug	to	his	parents.	They’d	greeted	her	politely	enough	an	hour ago	at	Doug’s	place,	as	did	his	sister.	Now	the	other	two	women	were	walking side-by-side	through	the	crowded	outdoor	venue,	seemingly	content	with	each other’s	company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Walking	around	here	for	‘a	bit’	is	about	all	I	can	take,”	said	Eddie.	“We	came only	to	visit	with	you	and	your	sister.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	to	admit,”	Helen	chimed	in,	“that	we’ve	seen	more	people	here	in	twenty minutes	than	we	see	in	twenty	days	back	home.”	An	adorable	grin	crossed	her face.	“But	it’s	fun.	Look	at	the	acrobats,	right	there.”	She	pointed	to	the entertainers	while	Eve	smiled	at	her	brother.	“I	think	Mom’s	enjoying	herself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	about	you,	Evie?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	yeah.”	She	waved	broadly.	“This	is	so	great.	Being	totally	away	from	the hospital	actually	feels	weird,	but	good.	Oh,	look—anyone	want	to	play	ping-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>pong?”	She	glanced	over	her	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	take	you	on.”	Ed’s	eyes	were	on	his	daughter—his	shining	eyes—	and	a smile	lit	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	that’s	the	way	it	is,”	Doug	murmured	to	Jen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	stepped	closer	to	them	as	an	enthusiastic	five-minute	ping-pong	volley ensued.	She	cheered	her	family	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Reminds	me	of	our	ping-pong	championships	in	the	basement,”	she	said, looking	from	Doug	to	Jen.	“Great	on	bleak	winter	days	when	the	kids	were	little, and	the	weather	was	abominable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sounds	like	a	nice	pastime,”	said	Jen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	drank	hot	chocolate	and	tried	to	make	a	little	party	of	it,	remember	Doug?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	faced	Jen	again.	“The	winters	in	New	England	can	be	brutal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	well	aware,”	said	Jen.	“I	grew	up	in	Woodhaven,	not	too	far	from	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?	And	now	you’re	in	the	big	city.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	felt	her	smile	spread	from	ear	to	ear.	“I	totally	love	it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen	looked	at	her	son.	“Well,	she’s	a	perfect	match	in	that	regard!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	had	rarely	seen	Doug	embarrassed	before,	but	now	his	face	turned	a	deep pink.	“Mom!	Enough!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	swallowed	her	grin	as	well	as	her	own	discomfort	and	changed	the	subject. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“C’mon	everyone.	Let’s	start	walking	toward	Maguire’s.	A	slow	walk,	so	Helen can	see	everything	at	the	Marketplace.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Street	performers,	magicians,	acrobats,	musicians…	Jen	was	glad	of	the distractions	for	Doug’s	family,	and	glad	to	have	allowed	enough	time	to	arrive promptly	at	the	restaurant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	opened	the	front	door.	“Welcome	to	our	Friday	night	hangout.	Go	right	on in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>“Blessed	air-conditioning,”	said	Eddie.	“Thank	God.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jennifer	approached	the	hostess.	“We’re	here	on	time!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	ya	doing,	Jennifer?”	said	the	woman.	“Your	table’s	ready	and	the	rest	of your	party’s	already	seated.”	She	leaned	closer.	“I	didn’t	say	a	word	about	our favorite	QB	to	anyone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	high-fived	her.	“Is	my	favorite	emcee	here	as	well?”	She	scanned	the	room but	couldn’t	see	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	sure.	Tony’s	here.	We’ve	got	live	music,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	making	me	work	for	my	supper	today!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	shrugged.	“That’s	life,	but	we	all	love	it	when	you	show	up.”	She leaned	in	again.	“You	should	hear	some	of	the—well	I	wouldn’t	call	them singers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm…Doesn’t	matter.	I	guess	karaoke	is	a	draw	for	Maguire’s.	Good	business decision.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	for	sure.	Follow	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mike	and	Lisa	stood	as	they	approached,	and	Jen	elbowed	Doug	and	nodded	at her	brother-in-law.	Mike	was,	indeed,	sporting	a	baseball	cap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Incognito?”	Jen	asked,	giving	him	a	kiss	on	the	cheek	and	then	hugging	her sister.	“You	look	wonderful,	Lis.	The	best	yet	since	Brianna.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Glad	to	be	out	and	about,”	she	said,	extending	her	hand	to	Doug’s	mom	and dad.	“I’m	Jen’s	sister,	Lisa.	And	this	is	my	husband,	Mike.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eddie	looked	from	Jen	to	Lisa.	“Sisters,	huh?	Yah…there’s	a	resemblance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can’t	fool	DNA,”	said	Doug	as	they	all	took	their	seats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you	look	familiar,”	he	said	to	Mike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	quarterback	shrugged.	“Just	one	of	those	faces.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>Jen	never	questioned	Mike’s	desire	to	be	low-key,	especially	when	with	the family,	but	she	appreciated	it	that	day.	She	suspected	his	motivation	was	for	her sake.	The	rest	of	the	introductions	were	made	before	Jen	saw	Tony	heading	their way.	“Oops.	He	wants	payback	pretty	quickly,	it	seems.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,	folks,”	he	said,	“glad	you	made	it.”	He	homed	in	on	Jen.	“Are	you	ready? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	July	4th,	so	something	patriotic	to	start,	hmm?	Come	on,	we’ve	got	a	full house	and	more	coming	later.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Later?	Oh,	no,	Tony.	I’m	not	staying	all	night.	Besides,	you’ve	got	a	live	band today,	and	from	what	I’m	hearing,	they	sound	pretty	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	winked.	“Only	the	best	for	Maguires.	But	I	had	to	test	the	waters	with	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ya’	don’t	know	until	you	try.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	right,”	said	Jen,	waving	him	off.	“I’ll	see	you	in	a	few.”	She	glanced	around the	table.	“How	about	we	order	some	drinks	first.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only	a	soda	for	me,”	said	Eve,	“with	caffeine.	I’m	back	on	duty	at	midnight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	glanced	at	her	folks.	“Sorry.	That’s	just	the	way	it	works.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eddie	leaned	forward,	glancing	at	Mike	and	Lisa.	“She’s	a	doctor,	you	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Very	smart.	Works	very	hard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sure	you	do,”	said	Mike,	addressing	Eve.	“Long	hours	are	normal	for	some of	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eve’s	face	brightened.	“You’re	making	me	feel	better.	I’m	not	alone!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mike	and	Doug	both	smiled.	“You	can	always	call	me	at	midnight,”	said	her brother,	“if	you	want	to	feel	less	lonesome.	I’m	usually	at	the	computer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See,	Eddie,”	said	his	wife,	“we’re	the	only	ones	here	who	are	asleep	at midnight!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	server	approached,	took	their	drink	orders	and	gave	Jen	a	heads-up	from Tony.	“Band’s	on	break	now,	but	they’ll	be	back	in	five.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got	it,”	said	Jen,	checking	her	watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>“You	said	you	sang	a	little,”	said	Eddie,	nodding.	“Bet	you	can	earn	some	nice change	here.	Tips	and	all.	A	social	worker’s	salary	can’t	be	much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	expressions	on	her	sister	and	Mike’s	faces…priceless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does	anyone	have	duct-tape?”	asked	Doug	in	a	quiet	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	outta	here,”	said	Jen.	“We’ll	straighten	it	out	later.”	She	leaned	over	to	kiss Doug.	“You	can	always	stick	him	with	the	whole	check,”	she	whispered.	“And order	me	a	steak!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Genius.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Start	with	something	peppy	and	patriotic	so	that	the	diners	can	join	in,”	said Tony,	“but	then	switch	to	solos	where	they	just	listen.	We	don’t	want	them	to stop	eating	and	drinking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gotcha,”	said	Jen.	“Business	is	business	with	music	on	the	side.”	Perfectly reasonable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	at	the	band	leader,	gave	him	her	key	and	a	few	titles	she’d	thought about	in	advance.	“Can	we	do	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure	can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	took	the	mic	from	Tony	and	welcomed	the	diners	to	join	in	singing	 <i class="calibre4">It’s	A</i> <i class="calibre4">Grand	Old	Flag. </i>	What	could	be	more	patriotic	than	a	George	M.	Cohan	tune? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enthusiasm	almost	raised	the	roof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	did	a	fabulous	job,”	said	Jen	to	the	happy	audience	at	song’s	end.	“You must	all	have	had	voice	lessons	sometime	in	your	lives.	Honestly,	I	couldn’t have	done	it	alone!”	She	bowed,	waved,	and	invited	them	to	sit	back,	eat,	drink and	relax	while	she	celebrated	some	of	the	country’s	cities	and	states. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking	at	the	band,	she	nodded	and	drifted	into	John	Denver’s	 <i class="calibre4">Take	Me	Home,</i> <i class="calibre4">Country	Roads, </i>	a	celebration	of	West	Virginia.	The	applause	hadn’t	died	down before	she	began	Arlo	Guthrie’s	 <i class="calibre4">City	of	New	Orleans. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>When	she	finished,	she	waved,	blew	a	kiss,	wished	them	a	happy	Fourth.	And arrived	back	at	her	table	in	time	to	see	salad	being	served. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Better	than	ever,”	said	Doug.	“Every	time,	you	always	amaze	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	a	lot	of	fun,”	said	Jen.	She	glanced	at	her	sister.	“Remember	when…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa’s	hand	went	up	like	a	traffic	cop’s.	“Don’t	go	there.	I’m	having	a	good	day, no	crying,	no	exhaustion.	I	don’t	want	to	look	backward.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	got	it,”	said	Jen</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	what	any	of	you	are	talking	about,”	said	Eddie,	turning	toward	his son,	then	looking	directly	at	Jen.	“But	I	do	know	that	she’s	a	keeper!”	He	paused a	moment	before	saying,	“Be	fair	now,	Jennifer.	You	told	us	you	‘sing	a	little.’	Is that	what	you	call	 <i class="calibre4">a	little?” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yup,”	she	said,	nodding.	“It’s	a	wonderful	hobby.	I	enjoy	it	maybe	because	it’s not	my	job.	And…in	all	modesty…I	guess	I’m	pretty	good	at	it.”	She immediately	felt	heat	creep	up	her	neck.	Her	own	fault.	Since	when	did	she compliment	herself? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pretty	good?	You’re	great!”	Doug’s	praises	had	her	blushing	harder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lisa	and	I	used	to….”	She	stopped	herself,	glanced	apologetically	at	her	sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	forgot.	Sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	server	appeared	and	removed	the	salad	plates	before	Helen	spoke	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About	the	music	—	I	imagine	it’s	soothing	after	dealing	with	all	the	hard	cases you	must	have.	Homelessness,	child	protection…gosh,	what	area	are	you	in?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	ignored	her	family’s	stupefied	expressions	and	glanced	at	Doug	in	appeal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	leaned	toward	his	parents.	“Let’s	step	back	a	bit.	You	may	have	concluded that	Jen’s	a	social	worker,	but	if	you	think	back,	she	never	claimed	to	be.	What she	said	was,	‘I	help	people,	particularly	with	budgeting.’	You	both	assumed social	work	was	what	she	meant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh.”	A	pink	tint	stained	Helen’s	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well	then,	why	the	mystery?	What	do	you	do	for	a	living?”	Eddie’s	confusion</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>reinforced	his	wife’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	took	a	deep	breath.	“I	do	help	people,”	she	said.	“Just	in	a	different	way.	I help	them	manage	their	money.”	She	waved	toward	the	door.	“In	a	building	not too	from	here.	Fidelity	Investments.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	silence	around	the	table	was	broken	by	Eddie’s	deep	laughter.	“Financial consultant!	Oh,	boy.”	He	pointed	at	his	son.	“Good	work.	I	said	it	before,	this one’s	a	keeper.	You	picked	a	real	winner	who’ll	help	you	stay	out	of	trouble.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">His	father’s	words	crashed	against	Doug’s	ears	and	tore	his	last	nerve.	He	flew	to his	feet	and	loomed	over	the	man.	“You	listen	up,	Ed	Collins,	and	listen	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	may	not	believe	this,	but	I’m	making	a	good	living	as	a	playwright. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	as	for	Jennifer,	she	was	a	keeper	from	the	first	moment	I	saw	her.	From	the time	she	was	eighteen.	From	the	time	I	read	her	first	essay	and	saw	into	her heart.	She’s	not	only	smart,	she’s	beautiful	inside	and	out.	Why	do	you	think	I came	back	to	Boston?	She’s	everything	I	want	and	everything	any	sane	man would	want	for	a	lifetime,	would	want	for…a	wife.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	voice	dropped	to	a	whisper,	and	he	spun	toward	Jen.	Tears	were	running down	her	cheeks,	and	he	caught	them	with	shaking	fingers.	“Oh,	my	God,	Jen.	I love	you	so	much.	I	wanted	it	to	be	romantic,	on	a	cruise,	or	at	the	beach,	but—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	gazed	blindly	from	side	to	side,	unfocused	on	everything	but	the	woman	in front	of	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jennifer…”	he	whispered	like	a	prayer,	“will	you…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes!	Yes!”	Her	arms	came	around	his	neck	and	in	the	tiny	space	between	tables he	picked	her	up,	never	breaking	his	glance	until	he	kissed	her—-finally—before lowering	her	to	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	felt	her	arm	around	him	while	she	sought	her	sister’s	eyes	across	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Lisa	and	Mike	were	already	coming	over,	hugging,	kissing,	shaking	hands with	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome	to	the	family,”	said	Mike.	“I	couldn’t	be	happier…because	Jen	is happy.	Make	sure	she	stays	that	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>Doug	studied	the	other	man’s	features.	His	last	words	carried	more	concern	than threat.	“I	will	do	my	very	best.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Despite	the	legal	definitions,”	Mike	continued,	“I’ve	been	 <i class="calibre4">in	loco	parentis</i> since	she	was	sixteen….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you	for	that,”	said	Doug.	“It	couldn’t	have	been	easy,	but	you	did	a magnificent	job.	She’s	perfect.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	that’s	a	man	in	love!”	Mike	laughed	and	gathered	his	wife	to	him.	“Looks like	we	have	a	wedding	to	plan.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa	stood	on	tiptoe	and	kissed	her	husband.	“You	mean,	Jen	and	Doug	have	a wedding	to	plan.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Plan	is	the	word,”	said	Doug,	shaking	his	head.	“You’re	off	the	hook	on	this one.	But	who	knew	that	Maguires	would	be…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perfect,”	said	Jen.	“Good	memories	here,	and	you	just	added	to	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	deep	voice	added,	“You	should	thank	me,	son.	Without	me,	you’d	still	be hemming	and	hawing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	the	duct-tape,”	sighed	Doug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	father	can	be…ah…trying	at	times.”	Evie	leaned	over	to	kiss	Jen.	“I’m	so glad	about	this.	Doug’s	never	looked	happier.	And	that	you’re	right	here	in	town is	great.	If	I	ever	have	five	minutes	again…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Absolutely,”	said	Jen,	glancing	at	Lisa.	“We	know	how	to	do	sisters,	don’t	we?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	certainly	do.	Welcome	to	the	family,	Eve.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	if	the	best-laid	plans	often	went	astray,	they	left	room	for	the	unexpected events	to	work	out	well.	Doug	had	no	complaints	as	they	made	their	way	to	the Charles	River	Esplanade	for	the	concert.	Jennifer’s	hand	was	snuggled	in	his, and	he	supposed	they	had	a	pair	of	dopey	smiles	on	their	faces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	Jen? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>“Yes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Independence	Day,	huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	delightful	laugh	sprinkled	the	air,	and	Doug	wanted	to	capture	it	forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	he	would.	With	the	rough	patches	behind	them,	the	road	ahead	would	no doubt	be	smooth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	13</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	had	never	been	happier.	The	weeks	since	the	momentous	holiday	weekend seemed	to	fly	by	and	all	too	soon,	summer	was	in	her	rear-view	mirror.	Emily came	home	from	Tanglewood,	the	twins	drove	back	to	Florida	and	their	junior year	at	school.	Mike’s	NFL	season	had	started,	and	baby	Brianna	continued	to grow	and	thrive	while	her	big	brother,	Bobby,	started	pre-school.	Most importantly,	Doug’s	new	play	would	be	premiered	in	a	week. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	his	dismay,	she’d	started	a	scrapbook	for	his	work,	cutting	out	the	print	ads and	printing	out	the	on-line	ads	promoting	 <i class="calibre4">The	Sanctuary. </i>	Sitting	at	her	kitchen table	on	the	first	Sunday	evening	of	September,	she	adhered	the	latest	promo onto	a	page	in	the	album. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	boys	used	to	keep	a	scrapbook	for	Mike	when	they	were	little,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	they	still	do.	Or	maybe	Lisa’s	taken	over.	It	kept	the	kids	focused	on something	fun.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	keeping	you	focused	on	nonsense,”	he	complained.	“One	sample	ad	is enough.	Let’s	hope	you’ll	have	some	good	reviews	to	save	soon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	poor	guy	was	as	jittery	as	a	bride	the	day	before	her	wedding.	She	smiled, then	stood	to	give	him	a	kiss,	sneaking	a	glance	at	the	vintage	emerald	ring	on her	finger.	A	gorgeous	piece	that	fit	her	perfectly.	The	family	connection	to Doug’s	grandmother	wasn’t	lost	on	her	either.	The	man	had	simply	loved	his grandma. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	beautiful,”	she’d	whispered	when	he	put	it	on	her	finger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	not	more	beautiful	than	you,”	he’d	said,	before	emitting	a	big	sigh.	“I-I wasn’t	sure…it’s	not	the	usual	thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled	at	the	memory	and	refocused	on	the	job	at	hand.	“I	will	have	many good	reviews	to	save,”	she	said.	“The	play	is	wonderful.	The	cast	is	excellent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tickets	are	selling…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“…and	I’m	kissing	the	woman	I	love.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>She	relaxed	against	him,	relishing	the	firmness	of	his	arms	around	her,	and	still amazed	at	what	a	difference	one	summer	could	make	in	her	life.	“And	then	I’ll take	photos	of	everything	I	saved,”	she	continued,	“and	create	a	real	book.	There are	on-line	services	that	do	that.	Each	play	can	have	its	own	album.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got	it	all	figured	out,	huh?	Love	your	positive	thinking,	honey,	but	there	are bound	to	be	flops	along	the	way.	You	won’t	like	creating	souvenirs	for	those plays.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	I	won’t!”	She	grinned	and	took	a	step	back.	“I	understand	that	success	can be	a	sometime	thing	in	your	world,	so	make	hay	while	you	can.	We’ll	never starve,	Doug.	I’ve	seen	that	you’re	not	a	spendthrift,	and	you	know	I	love	my career.	I	can’t	see	ever	giving	it	up,	so	we’ll	have	that	income	to	depend	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	felt	his	pause.	“What	about	kids,	Jen?	We’ve	never	even	discussed	having	a family.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kids?”	she	asked,	totally	flabbergasted.	“I	am	so	not	ready!	I	barely	have enough	time	to	help	with	my	own	sisters	and	brothers!	Ask	me	again	later	on—</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	w-a-y	later	on.	In	the	meantime,	you	can	keep	giving	birth	to	new	plays.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	laughter	warmed	her	heart.	“That	I	will,	Henny	Penny.	I	certainly	will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	so	glad	you	had	the	gumption	to	come	back	to	Boston…to	come	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	cupped	her	face,	raised	her	chin.	“How	could	I	not?	My	heart	was	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	she	knew	that	it	was	true.	“I	think	mine	had	gone	into	hiding.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nah…more	like	hibernation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	eyed	him,	blinked	coquettishly	and	vamped.	“Just	waiting	for	my	prince	to come	along	and	awaken	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly!”	He	swung	her	around.	“A	romantic	fairy	tale	where	at	least	we	get	a happy	ending.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	idea	sprouted.	“Doug!	Why	not	write	a	love	story?	If	you	happen	to	get	a good	idea,	it	would	show	another	side	of	you.	And	if	it	were	comedic…with	a great	cast?	I’ll	bet	Broadway	audiences	would	go	for	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>His	jaw	dropped	a	little	and	he	nodded,	regarding	her	seriously.	“I’ve	considered a	love	story.	I’ll	let	you	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.	I’m	glad	I	can	contribute	something	to	you,	even	if	it’s	only	a	little	idea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">After	hugs	and	exclamations	of	welcome	for	Liz	and	Matt.	Jen	sat	down	for lunch	with	her	former	office	buddies.	Evan	and	Alexis	completed	the	group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	two	look	great,”	said	Jen.	“Tell	us	everything	about	Kentucky.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz	glanced	at	her	fiancé,	her	cheeks	pinking	up.	“Well…life	is	good.	I’m working	again,	and	you’ll	all	be	invited	to	a	wedding	at	Christmas	time!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Congratulations	echoed	around	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	you’ll	be	back,”	said	Jen.	She	reached	for	her	friends’	hands	and	squeezed them	both.	“So	glad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	that’s	where	it	ends	for	a	while,”	said	Matt.	“Actually,	Kentucky’s	been great.	Different—it	takes	some	getting	used	to	after	Boston,	but	it’s	all	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Any	new	place	would	take	getting	used	to,”	said	Alexis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	what	I	tell	myself,”	said	Liz.	“At	least	I’m	working	now.	But	making friends	is	taking	time,	and	with	no	family	around,	Sunday	can	be	a	pretty	long day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	still	newcomers,	but	we’re	looking	forward	to	planting	some	roots.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	Jen’s	stomach	wasn’t	already	knotted	in	anticipation	of	Doug’s	play’s	opening the	next	night,	it	would	have	formed	a	big	knot	then.	Planting	roots	halfway across	the	country?	No	family	nearby?	She	pasted	a	smile	on	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	are	wonderful	people—friendly	and	smart.	I’m	sure	you’ll	be	very	happy sooner	rather	than	later.	But	don’t	think	new	friends	can	replace	us!”	She	leaned forward,	and	in	a	stage-whisper	added,	“You	never	forget	you	first	love…s.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	that	remark	and	ensuing	laughter,	conversation	became	general,	as	though</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>the	couple	had	never	left	town. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry	Doug	couldn’t	join	us	for	lunch,”	said	Matt.	“He	must	be	busy	with	last-minute	details.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	as	on-edge	as	the	proverbial	cat	on	a	hot	tin	roof,”	said	Jen.	“We	just watched	the	movie	on	television	last	week,	and	it	was	powerful.”	She	gazed around	the	table.	“So	I’m	staying	far	away	from	Doug,	at	least,	until	tonight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Head	nods,	remarks	of	understanding	followed,	until	Liz	said,	“We	are	really happy	about	you	and	Doug,	and	we’re	dying	to	see	your	ring.	C’mon,	are	you wearing	it	or	is	it	getting	fitted	or	something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly,	Jen	held	out	her	left	hand,	showing	her	emerald.	“Turns	out	I	love	the guy.	I’m	even	getting	used	to	the	idea	of	spending	time	in	New	York.	It-It’s	not that	far	after	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whoa-a-a-a!”	said	Matt.	“We...never	said	it	was.	“But	you?	Wow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,”	she	whispered.	“A	leap	of	faith	with	the	right	partner…my	mom’s advice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	caught	the	inquiring	glances	that	passed	among	her	friends.	“Oh,	stop	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	folks	are	still	here.”	She	patted	her	chest.	“I	want	what	they	had.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	you’ll	get	it,”	said	Alexis.	“I’m	guessing	you	figured	out	that	Doug	needs Broadway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	can	write	anywhere,	but…yes.	And	that	reminds	me—	two	producers	will be	in	the	audience	tomorrow	night.	They’re	the	ones	who	get	the	backers	for	a play.	So,	will	you	applaud	until	your	hands	sting,	please?”	She	took	a	breath.	“I don’t	know	how	Doug	does	what	he	does.	I	don’t	know	how	he	puts	up	with	the stress.	But	I	did	learn	that	playwriting	is	a	business.	And	 <i class="calibre4">that </i>	part,	I understand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ouch,”	said	Alexis.	“My	hands	are	stinging	in	advance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	gave	her	a	thumbs-up.	“And	we’ve	got	to	get	back	to	work.	Oh,	I	almost forgot.”	She	reached	into	her	handbag.	“Voila.	Your	tickets.	I’ll	see	you	all	again tomorrow	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>##</p>
<p class="calibre1">If	Doug’s	nerves	were	not	shot	before	the	performance,	they	were	beyond frazzled	after	intermission,	when	he	noticed	a	dozen	empty	seats	that	had	been occupied	earlier.	So	not	everyone	returned	for	the	second	half.	Not	a	good	sign. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	mingled	with	the	crowd	in	the	lobby	a	little	earlier,	trying	to	overhear comments.	General	chitchat	was	almost	all	he	got,	but	reaction	to	the	play seemed	good.	He	laughed	at	a	woman’s	warning,	“…it’s	breaking	my	heart,	but it	 <i class="calibre4">better </i>	have	a	good	ending.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Not	to	worry,	Ma’am. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Half-a-dozen	of	his	students	surrounded	him,	effusive	with	compliments.	At least	they	were	a	distraction.	He	comforted	himself	with	the	knowledge	that Alan	Silverman	had	returned.	The	producer	nodded	on	the	way	back	to	his	seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	talk	later.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Would	it	be	a	good	talk	or	bad?	The	anticipation	was	like	waiting	for	a	test	result that	would	affect	the	rest	of	his	life.	Jen	rushed	by,	bestowed	a	kiss,	and whispered,	“I	love	the	story.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Very	unbiased.	It	meant	nothing.	He’d	told	her	to	stay	with	their	family	and friends	until	afterwards,	when	they’d	either	celebrate	or	pick	up	the	pieces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	a	way	to	make	a	living.	Throwing	himself	out	there	for	brutal	criticism.	Or applause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stood	in	the	back	of	the	theater,	watching	the	second	half	with	a	critical	eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’d	all	worked	hard—the	actors,	director,	producer—but	he	sensed something	different	from	a	Broadway	production.	Something	lacking.	He	took	a deep	breath	and	kept	watching,	while	his	expectations	fell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	his	surprise,	the	audience’s	reaction	sustained	a	curtain	call	for	the	cast.	A hometown	thing?	Support	for	regional	theater?	And	then	Jen	was	at	his	side, bestowing	kisses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	great,	Doug.	In	my	humble	opinion,	your	story	made	the	actors	look good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	sure...some	people	didn’t	return	for	the	second	act.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>“Maybe	they	got	sick	or	something.	Smile!	We	all	enjoyed	it.”	She	nodded	at their	crowd	of	family	and	friends	making	their	way	up	the	aisle.	But	his	eyes were	only	on	Silverman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“C’mon,	my	man,”	said	the	producer,	“let’s	go	for	a	drink.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right	after	I	visit	backstage,”	said	Doug.	“They’ll	be	waiting	and	wondering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’ve	been	working	together	for	months.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	did	a	fine	job,”	said	Silverman.	“But	make	no	promises	to	them.”	He paused	a	moment.	“Traditionally,	we	cast	in	New	York	and	take	the	play	to	a	city or	two	in	order	to	hone	it,	get	the	kinks	out.	Kiddo,	you	did	it	ass-backwards.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	had	my	reasons,”	said	Doug	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silverman’s	gaze	passed	from	Doug	to	Jen	and	back.	“Don’t	blame	you	a	bit.	So how	about	I’ll	wait	for	you	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	I’ll	take	the	gang	to	our	usual	watering	spot,”	said	Jen.	“I	don’t	want	to	be in	the	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	quick	smile,	furrowed	brow,	and	the	question	in	her	voice…	Oh,	she	so wanted	to	stay.	With	a	fond	smile,	Doug	said,	“And	since	when	did	good manners	ever	stop	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	eyes	popped	open	wider	than	dinner	plates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	a	visit	to	the	doctor,	eh?”	he	said,	reaching	for	her	hand.	“Hang	out,	and we’ll	catch	up	with	the	others	later.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	us,”	said	Mike.	“I’m	taking	Lisa	and	Emily	home.	Babies	don’t	appreciate their	moms	having	late	nights.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emily	approached	and	hugged	Doug.	“I	bet	you	got	lost	in	writing	that,”	she whispered	in	his	ear.	“I’m	glad	I’m	not	the	only	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	they	say,	Emily,	it’s	a	tough	job,	but	someone	has	to	do	it.”	He	squeezed	her hand.	“You’re	not	alone,	kiddo.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>He	shook	Mike’s	hand.	“I	feel	lucky	you	had	a	bye	week	and	could	catch	the show.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sometimes	things	work	out.	Good	job.	Touchdown.”	Waving,	he	and	Lisa	left the	theater. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz	and	Matt	came	closer.	“Unfortunately,	we	have	a	flight	to	catch	in	the morning,”	said	Liz.	“But	we’re	so	glad	we	came.	We	loved	the	play.	I	laughed and	cried.	Good	luck	with	it	and	with…everything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See	you	at	the	wedding,”	said	Jen,	waving	as	they	walked	out	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	about	Alexis	and	I	take	your	folks	to	Maguires	and	meet	you	there	when you’re	ready?”	asked	Evan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	go,	too,”	added	Eve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whew,	that	was	fast,”	said	Doug.	“Give	me	a	few	minutes	with	the	cast	and we’ll	head	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ten	minutes	later,	the	three	started	toward	the	producer’s	downtown	hotel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Walking	at	night	is	almost	as	good	as	a	drink	in	a	dark	bar,”	said	Silverman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Privacy	on	the	street.	So	tell	me	what	you	saw	tonight,	Doug.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Strange	question.	“I’m	not	sure,	to	tell	the	truth.	The	audience	seemed	to	like	it, but…something…”	He	gestured	impatiently.	“It	sort	of	didn’t	match	what	I	was hearing	in	my	head.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent	answer,”	agreed	Silverman.	“I’m	happy	to	say	that	your	material	was better	than	the	interpretation.	And	that’s	what	was	off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	the	actors	worked	so	hard!”	said	Jennifer,	stopping	in	mid-stride.	“They knew	every	line.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sure	they	worked	hard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	tugged	her	hand.	“What	he’s	saying,	Jen,	is	that	the	actors	were	not Broadway	caliber.	And	the	director	didn’t	know	how	to	pull	more	out	of	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silverman	broke	in.	“For	example,	substitute	Glenn	Close	as	the	older	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>Think	what	she	could	bring	to	that	part.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	understood	immediately,	but	his	mind	was	on	one	track.	“So	it’s	not	the script!	I	couldn’t	put	my	finger	on…And	when	some	people	didn’t	return	for	the second	act…”	He	closed	his	eyes,	his	mind	sorting	out	the	numerous	rehearsals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry	for	the	rambling.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what	you’re	saying	is	that	we	have	a	friendlier	audience	here	who	enjoyed	it without	Glenn	Close,”	said	Jen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	who	paid	a	quarter	of	the	price,”	said	the	producer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	sensed	Jen	standing	taller,	on	alert.	“So,	what	exactly	are	you	saying,	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silverman?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	saying	that	I’ll	be	making	a	lot	of	phone	calls,	and	the	first	one	will	be	to my	brother.	I’ll	also	need	a	copy	of	the	script.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	caught	Jen’s	glance.	In	the	light	of	the	streetlamp,	her	eyes	shone,	the corners	of	her	mouth	rose,	and	he	felt	her	exuberance	in	the	air	around	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Told	you	so,”	she	bragged.	“I	knew	all	the	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,”	he	said.	“Enjoy	the	moment,	but	remember	that	a	writer’s	life	is	a rollercoaster	ride.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	14</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">In	a	daze,	Doug	disconnected	the	call	from	Steve	Kantor	and	tossed	the	cell phone	onto	his	desk.	A	roller-coaster	ride.	He’d	warned	Jen,	but	even	Doug could	not	have	known	how	prophetic	his	warning	would	be.	They’d	both	been euphoric	with	the	Silverman	brothers’	plans	to	investigate	a	Broadway production	of	The	Sanctuary.	But	this	latest	news…?	A	shocker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	glanced	at	his	watch,	then	rose,	too	restless	and	distracted	now	to	keep working.	Outside	his	window,	sunlight	cast	long	shadows.	The	maple	trees	that lined	the	street	were	almost	bare,	but	for	a	few	stubborn	leaves	still	clinging	to their	branches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grabbing	his	jacket,	he	closed	the	door	behind	him,	ran	down	the	flight	of	stairs and	stepped	outdoors.	Jen	would	be	leaving	work	soon.	On	this	crisp	afternoon in	October,	he’d	surprise	her	at	her	office	building.	He’d	figure	out	what	to	say as	he	walked.	All	he	had	to	do	was	come	up	with	a	monologue.	Some comforting	words	so	she	wouldn’t	freak	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Who	was	he	kidding?	Of	course	she’d	freak	out	at	the	mention	of	Los	Angeles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	timing	couldn’t	be	worse.	She’d	finally	become	comfortable	with	the	need to	commute	to	New	York,	to	being	part	of	his	life	there.	Her	current	to-do	list included	finding	a	place	to	sublet	in	the	city	as	well	as	planning	a	modest	spring wedding.	A	big	enough	list	when	added	to	her	career. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	what	seemed	like	only	moments,	Doug	reached	his	destination	and	began	to pace,	while	keeping	an	eye	on	the	heavy	glass	doors.	As	people	started	exiting, he	sharpened	his	gaze	until	there,	in	the	midst	of	a	crowd,	he	spotted	Jen.	He could	pick	her	out	among	millions	just	by	the	way	she	walked,	how	she	tilted	her head,	her	profile	with	the	cute	nose.	He	waved	and	approached	her.	Even	in	the dusk	of	evening,	he	saw	her	wide	grin	and	answering	wave.	And	then	she	was	in his	arms,	jabbering	her	delight	and	asking	questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	guess	you	needed	a	break,”	she	said,	now	slipping	her	arm	through	his. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you	are	the	best	excuse	for	one.”	He	leaned	over	and	kissed	her	quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>“Let’s	walk	and	talk.	I	received…let’s	say…an	unusual	phone	call.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	turned	her	head	and	lifted	her	face	toward	him.	“Is	something	wrong?	Is someone	sick?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	no.	Nothing	like	that.	I	didn’t	mean	to	scare	you.	It’s	just	that	Steve	called me	from	New	York.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	resumed	their	stroll.	“What	about?	Another	play?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sort	of.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sort	of?	I	think	we’ve	discovered	that	you	don’t	write	novels	too	well.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	could	make	him	laugh.	“Remember	you	once	suggested	that audiences	might	enjoy	a	love	story?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	nose	scrunched	up	as	she	thought	about	her	answer.	“Hmm…you’re	right.	I remember	throwing	that	idea	around.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	the	truth	is,	I	actually	had	written	a	love	story,	Jen.	That	story	was	the failed	novel,	which	I	later	rewrote	as	a	play.”	Feed	her	the	facts	little	by	little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	but	I	wasn’t	ready	to	talk	about	it	with	anyone.	I	sent	the	script	to	Steve just	for	some	feedback.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	that	was	the	call	you	received	today?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	paused	and	turned	her	toward	him.	He	needed	to	see	her	reaction.	“Yes.	The title	is	 <i class="calibre4">Straight	from	the	Heart. </i>	Steve	liked	it	enough	to	send	it	to	a	friend	of his.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	one?	I	met	quite	a	few	of	your	theater	friends	when	we	were	in	the	city.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	more	Doug	revealed,	the	more	nervous	he	got.	He	wanted	this	opportunity, but	he	also	wanted	Jen’s	buy-in.	His	heart	thumped	hard,	and	his	hand	sweated in	the	cool	of	the	evening.	He	tried	to	choose	his	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ahh…none	of	that	bunch.	This	friend	of	Steve’s	wants	to	talk	about	converting</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>it	to	a	screenplay.”	He	stopped	talking	to	let	the	meaning	resonate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	screenplay?	In	New	York?	I	don’t…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“…not	New	York.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’d	reached	her	building.	“Let’s	go	upstairs,”	he	said.	“I’ll	explain everything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	twirled	and	her	eyes	met	his.	“California.	You’re	talking	about	California. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Screenplays	get	made	into	movies,	don’t	they?	Wow,	Doug.	You	don’t	give	me	a chance	to	breathe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	take	a	deep	breath	now.	Take	several.	It	probably	won’t	happen	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	took	the	key	from	her	shaking	hand.	“Relax,	Henny-Penny.	Ninety-five percent	of	manuscripts	don’t	make	it	through.	And	ninety-five	percent	of	the ones	optioned	never	make	it	to	the	screen.	My	little	play	is	a	needle	in	the haystack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	watched	her	silently	put	her	purse	on	the	table	and	take	off	her	coat.	Her changes	of	expression	told	him	her	mind	was	racing	as	fast	as	a	car	at	the	Indy 500. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you’re	so	excited.	If	it’s	a	nothing	chance,	why	are	you	so	excited?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Good	question.	Not	an	honorable	answer.	“Because,	sweetheart,	I	think	it’s	a compliment	just	to	be	asked	to	the	ball.	And	it	also	looks	great	on	my	resume.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	her	eyes	sparkled.	“You	mean	it’s	good	for	your	ego!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That,	too.”	He	beckoned	to	her,	and	she	came,	arms	raised	to	wrap	around	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	love	you,	Jen.	So	very	much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Make	that	times	two.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know.	And	I	also	know	you’ll	understand	that	I	need	to	talk	to	Steve’s connection	in	L.A.	He’s	an	agent	who’s	setting	up	a	meeting	with	some	studio mucky-mucks.	I	don’t	even	know	which	studio.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	plopped	herself	on	the	couch.	“And	I	know	you’ll	understand	when	I	say	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>have	a	three	thousand	pound	stomachache,	one	pound	for	every	mile.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	could	well	believe	that.	“If	any	of	my	work	winds	up	on	the	big	screen, sweetheart,	you’ll	never	have	to	worry	about	budgeting	again.	We’re	talking about	more	money	than	Broadway	could	ever	pay	out	with	one	play.”	And	if	that didn’t	win	her	over	her,	nothing	he	said	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	mouth	opened	and	closed.	Her	head	tilted	back.	“You’ve	struck	out.	I	don’t worry	about	that	anymore	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	morning,	her	first	instinct	was	to	call	Lisa,	but	she	stopped	herself.	She’d go	to	work	as	usual,	focus	on	her	clients	as	usual,	supervise	staff	as	usual.	She’d cling	to	her	routine	as	if	it	were	a	lifesaver.	And	perhaps	it	would	prove	to	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lunchtime	presented	a	challenge.	She	could	barely	eat,	and	an	hour	of	free	time allowed	her	to	think	too	much.  <i class="calibre4">Don’t	dump	this	on	Lisa. </i>	Jen	had	thought Kentucky	was	an	awful	move	for	Liz	and	Matt.	If	they	knew	her	predicament now,	they’d	laugh.	Not	that	anything	was	settled.	According	to	Doug,	far	from	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	he’d	been	having	a	pretty	fantastic	year.	If	this	was	a	roller-coaster	ride,	he was	still	climbing	high,	with	no	bottom	in	sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	could	she	deny	him? </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	how	could	she	deny	herself	the	pleasure	of	family?	They	needed	each	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">—in	Boston.	She’d	made	that	clear	to	Doug,	and	she’d	already	compromised about	New	York.	Wasn’t	that	enough? </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	went	home	with	a	headache.	And	got	a	bigger	one	when	Doug	told	her,	“I’m flying	out	next	Thursday	night	to	meet	with	the	agent	and	discuss	the	story	with the	studio	guys.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	worked	fast.	Too	fast.	“What	about	your	teaching	schedule?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	only	miss	Friday	office	hours.	I’ll	take	the	red-eye	Sunday	night	and	be home	in	time	for	Monday	classes.	George	is	one	of	the	best-connected	people	in Hollywood.	We	can’t	miss	this	opportunity,	Jenny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	began	pacing.	“Maybe	you	can’t,	but	I	can.	Things	are	going	so	well	for	us</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>now,	Doug.	We’ve	figured	out	our	lives.	Broadway,	Boston,	Emily,	Lisa	and Mike	and	the	twins	and	the	babies.	And	even	Eve.	We	have	a	plan.	We	have	a path.	You’re	breaking	my	heart.	I	wish	your	happiness	didn’t	cause	sadness	for me.”	Her	eyes	filled,	and	she	couldn’t	stop	the	tears.	“Sorry.”	She	grabbed	a tissue	and	headed	to	the	sofa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	deep	quiet	followed.	She	could	hear	the	tick	of	the	wall	clock	nearby.	She could	hear	Doug’s	soft	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	I’m	not	going.	Sadness?	You’re	the	last	person	on	earth	who	I’d	want	to hurt.	I	vote	for	both	of	us	to	be	happy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	she	shook	her	head,	logic	taking	over.	“You	have	to	go.	I	can’t	be responsible	for	a	missed	opportunity	of	that	scope.	And	besides,	decisions	made in	the	heat	of	the	moment	are	never	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	gave	a	sharp	nod.	“Jenny,	I	guarantee	that	in	the	end,	this	will	turn	out	to	be simply	an	educational	opportunity.	I’m	familiar	with	the	industry,	but	I’ll	just learn	about	it	better	from	the	inside.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shrugged.	“Whatever.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	worst	response	in	the	world.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">She	actually	agreed	with	him.	Her	response	had	sounded	childish,	but	it	was	the only	thing	she	could	produce	while	numb.	Living	with	Doug	was	proving	to	be anything	but	calm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	following	Saturday	morning,	while	Doug	was	away,	she	practiced	with	the chorus	again,	preparing	for	their	annual	winter	concert.	In	the	afternoon,	she cleaned	the	apartment	as	though	preparing	for	a	military	inspection.	Not	a	speck of	dust,	not	a	crumb	of	bread	dared	to	show	itself.	She	changed	linen,	did laundry	and	reviewed	her	wardrobe.	Maybe	a	shopping	trip	was	in	order. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	called	Lisa.	“Want	to	introduce	Briana	to	the	wonders	of	shopping	with	her mom	and	auntie?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lisa	laughed.	“Sounds	great	except	for	one	thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a>“What’s	that?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Man,	you’re	getting	forgetful.	The	Riders	are	at	home	tomorrow.	We	expected you	and	Doug	to	join	us.	I	planned	to	take	the	kids	and	pick	you	up	on	the	way to	the	stadium.	Actually,	Luis	will	be	driving.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	took	a	quick	look	at	her	calendar.	Her	sister	was	absolutely	right.	“I’ll	be ready,	but	Doug’s	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“New	York?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	this	time.	I’ll	fill	you	in	tomorrow.	No	big	deal.”	She	tried	to	make	her voice	light	and	airy,	but	her	sister	knew	her	too	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay…for	now.	We’ll	figure	it	out	tomorrow.	Love	you,	Jen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Back	at	you,	Lis.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	disconnected	and	fell	back	into	a	chair—a	chair	polished	so	brightly	she could	see	her	reflection	in	the	wood.	Two	nights.	He’d	been	away	only	two nights,	and	the	place	was	so	quiet.	Too	quiet.	No	jokes.	No	discussions,	no	one asking	about	her	day.	She	missed	him!	True	enough.	But	he	made	her	nutsy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow,	he	pushed	her	most	sensitive	buttons.	What	had	happened	to	her calm,	planned	and	ordered	life,	the	life	she’d	enjoyed	only	six	months	ago? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doug	happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Together,	they	were	strong.	Together,	with	their	arms	around	each	other,	that	was bliss.	That	was	safety.	So	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	this	pick-up-and-go	business?	The	lack	of	routine,	always	changing	goals? </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	bad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	called	Lisa	again.	“One	yes	or	no	question,	Lis,	so	listen	hard.	If	Mike	had been	recruited	by	San	Francisco	or	Kansas	City	or	Miami…would	you	still	have gone	off	with	him?	Packed	us	all	up	and	moved?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course!	Boston	seemed	a	million	miles	from	home	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	memory	stirred.	“Thanks,	Lis.”	Jen	threw	the	phone	on	the	table	and	ran	to	her</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a>bedroom	closet.	Up	high,	high	on	a	shelf	was	her	box	of	keepsakes.	She	pulled	it down	and	peered	inside,	not	pausing	to	examine	the	trinkets	of	the	past,	simply searching	for	that	college	notebook.	The	one	with	the	essay	Doug	had	referred	to countless	times,	the	essay	he’d	read	aloud	to	their	class	in	his	clear,	beautiful voice.	She	took	a	deep	breath	and	skimmed:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Most	journeys	are	measured	in	miles.	My	longest	journey	began	and	ended	in</i> <i class="calibre4">the	moment	my	parents	died	in	an	auto	accident…	In	that	moment,	I	left</i> <i class="calibre4">childhood	behind	and	clawed	my	way	up	to	adult	status.	At	least	I	tried	to.	Lisa</i> <i class="calibre4">wasn’t	home,	and	the	three	younger	kids	ran	to	me	first	on	that	terrible,	life-changing	day.	I	held	them	close	while	we	waited,	and	they	clung	to	me	like</i> <i class="calibre4">babies	to	their	mother.	They	were	too	little	to	know	that	I	was	a	baby,	too. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">They’d	needed	her!	Needed	her	to	survive.	No	wonder	she	felt	guilty	leaving them.	She	continued	reading. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Although	the	distance	between	Woodhaven	and	Boston	is	one-	hundred	miles,	I</i> <i class="calibre4">measure	my	journey	in	light	years.	The	wounds	of	childhood	still	bleed	and	my</i> <i class="calibre4">journey	continues. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sat	on	the	edge	of	her	bed	and	re-read	the	last	line.	Her	journey	had continued	and	would	continue.	An	exciting	future	beckoned.	All	she	needed	was to	take	that	leap	of	faith	with	Doug.	She	browsed	other	essays.	Geez,	she’d	been a	mess.	Why	had	Doug	ever	befriended	her?	What	had	he	seen? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Laughter	rose.	The	guy	had	already	taken	his	leap	of	faith—with	her! </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	walked	back	into	the	living	room	and	brushed	her	hand	once	more	over	her parents’	portrait.	“Thanks	for	the	advice,	Mom	and	Dad.	It	feels	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	slept	on	the	plane,	so	now	all	I	need	is	a	quick	shower	and	I’ll	go	to	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jen	could	have	stayed	in	his	arms	for	the	entire	day,	but	she	was	dressed	and ready	to	leave	the	apartment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	talk	tonight,”	said	Doug.	“I	hope	you’ll	be	happy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hope	we’ll	both	be	happy.”	She	kissed	him	on	the	cheek	and	ran	out	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a>“Don’t	want	to	be	late.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	she	was	late	getting	home	that	night.	Doug	had	been	cool	with	the	delay when	she’d	warned	him	about	it	on	the	phone,	and	Jen	had	wondered	about	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	as	soon	as	she	walked	through	the	apartment	door,	she	understood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	white	cloth	and	candles	dressed	the	kitchen	table.	A	wine	glass	sparkled	at each	place	setting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	they	say,	timing	is	everything,”	said	Doug,	bending	to	kiss	her.	“You couldn’t	have	chosen	a	better	day	to	be	delayed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	we	celebrating?”	she	asked,	waving	at	the	table,	her	heart	beating	fast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	new	job	in	Hollywood?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	took	a	step	and	stared	at	her.	“Not	exactly.	Unless	you	change	my	mind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	understand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	poured	the	wine	and	handed	her	a	glass.	“A	toast	to	you.	To	us.”	He	raised his	glass	and	she	tapped	it	with	hers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	Definitely.”	She	took	a	sip.	“Now	sit	down	and	talk	to	me.	Our	phone conversations	left	me	hanging.	So	if	you	don’t	want	curiosity	to	kill	this	cat...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	laughter	rang	out.	“Never.	First	off,	the	meetings	went	well.	George	liked	the play,	and	the	studio	is	thinking	about	an	option.	I	never	would	have	gotten	that far	without	Steve’s	connection	to	George.	The	man	has	clout.	He’s	got	a	good eye	for	a	story.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	he’s	a	frustrated	writer.	Regardless,	he’s	smart.	He	loved	your	work,	and I’m	not	surprised.”	She	beamed	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Save	that	smile	for	later!”	He	kissed	her	quickly	on	the	mouth.	“The	big	thing is,	Jen,	if	it	happens—and	this	is	the	part	you’ll	really	like—the	money	I’d	earn</p>
<p class="calibre1">—well…with	your	investment	savvy,	you’d	never	worry	about	money	again—</p>
<p class="calibre1">even	while	married	to	a	writer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	humor	faded.	Her	hands	trembled,	and	she	put	her	glass	down.	“But	I’m	not worried	at	all…” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>He	waved	her	words	away.	“There’s	other	good	stuff—like	seeing	my	script transformed	onto	the	big	screen.	Going	to	an	opening…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop,	Doug.	Just	stop.	All	this—this	‘good	stuff’	as	you	say,	doesn’t	match	the expression	on	your	face.	You	look	worried.	Unhappy.	So	I’ll	put	you	out	of	your misery.	I	think	it’s	great.	I’ll	go.	I	won’t	argue.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stared	at	her	incredulously	and	emitted	a	bark	of	laughter.	“You’ll	go?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	said	so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	came	around	to	her	where	she	sat,	grabbed	another	chair	and	took	her	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	felt	the	heat	rise	to	her	neck	ad	face.	“I	figured	a	few	things	out	while	you were	gone.”	Her	voice	caught.	“I	figured	out	that	the	kids	don’t	need	me	like they	used	to.	More	important,	I	discovered	that	home—our	home—is	wherever we	are	together.”	She	leaned	forward,	wrapped	her	arms	around	his	neck	and kissed	him	with	a	renewed	hunger.	“You’ve	always	been	the	one.”	She	tilted	her head	back	and	saw	him	blink	quickly,	his	eyes	moist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	the	luckiest	man	in	the	world.”	His	voice	was	hoarse.	“I	love	you,	my Henny-Penny,	from	deep	down	in	here.”	He	tapped	the	left	side	of	his	chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,”	she	whispered,	then	sat	up	straight.	“Now	that	we’ve	got	that	resolved, let’s	plan.	Hmm…we’ll	probably	stay	put	until	the	end	of	the	semester.	When	do you	think	I	should	give	my	notice?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	kissed	her	palm,	then	each	of	her	fingers.	“You	don’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?	Can	you	work	from	home?	Or	commute	on	the	red-eye?	That	would	be great.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	rose	and	started	pacing.	“I	didn’t	say	that,	but	I	also	figured	a	few	things	out during	the	last	several	days.”	He	sighed	a	deep	sigh.	“I-I	guess	it	was	a significant	trip.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	took	another	sip	of	wine	and	waited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They-they	really	liked	my	work.	They	knew	about	 <i class="calibre4">The	Sanctuary, </i>	too.”	He</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a>paused	and	took	her	hands.	“And	they	talked	to	me	about	emulating	Neil Simon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	gulped,	the	wine	almost	choking	her.	“Plays	and	movies,	New	York	and	Los Angeles?  <i class="calibre4">That </i>	Neil	Simon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	gave	a	sharp	nod.	“Yeah.	The	man	who	has	a	Broadway	theater	named	for him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	a	compliment!	You	should	have	been	flattered.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Frankly,	I	was	overwhelmed.	And	a	little	uncomfortable.	There	are	a	thousand writers	in	L.A.	who’d	kill	for	a	chance	like	that.	Why	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	the	other	guys	didn’t	write	your	script.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	silent	for	a	moment.	“Yeah.	The	script.	I	need	to	tell	you	about	the script.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.	I’m	listening.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	rubbed	his	hands	together,	started	to	explain,	stopped,	and	started	again.	“The love	story	is	based	on	us,	Jen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sucker	punched.	“What	do	you	mean,	based	on	us?	On	what	happened	to	my family	with	Lisa	and	Mike	and	the	Riders…?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	he	was	shaking	his	head.	“Of	course	not.	I	fictionalized	the	family	and	the background.	The	only	part	that’s	true	is	the	accident.	If	you	don’t	like	it…then	it goes	in	the	closet.	I	wrote	it	in	New	York,	before	I	moved	back.	But	if	it	gets produced	anywhere,	I	want	to	have	control	over	it.	And	I	won’t	have	that	in Hollywood.	A	movie	is	truly	a	group	effort.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	cleared	his	throat.	“So,	in	the	end,	Jen,	I	turned	them	down.	And	I	hope you’re	not	upset	about,	you	know…	the	money	part.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drowning.	In	over	her	head.	The	only	thing	she	could	think	to	ask	was,	“What did	you	call	the	story?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	coughed.	Squirmed	a	bit.	“I-I	hope	you’ll	understand.	The	complete	title	is:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a> <i class="calibre4">Straight	from	the	Heart:	A	Love	Story	in	Search	of	an	Ending.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh-h...”	Of	course,	it	fell	into	place.	She	squeezed	her	eyes	shut	and	pictured Doug,	living	in	New	York,	writing,	tending	bar,	thinking	about	her.	Not knowing,	just	hoping.	Praying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Standing	on	shaky	legs,	she	stepped	forward	and	caressed	his	cheeks.	“Our	love story	began	and	will	continue	right	here.	As	for	Hollywood?	Maybe	next	time, everything	will	work	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	kiss	was	strong,	sure	and	bold.	“Raise	your	glass,”	he	said.	“Here’s	to	our future—the	Delany-Collins	branch	of	the	family.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	new	beginnings,”	she	added,	“and	a	never-boring,	adventurous	life—with the	right	person.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">An	organized	mess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Megan	Ross	stood	behind	her	desk	and	reviewed	the	colored	folders,	calendars, lists	and	the	dozen	printouts	she’d	need	for	the	coming	week.	She	preferred blending	manual	and	electronic	methods	when	creating	her	schedules.	Each worked	for	her,	and	to	succeed,	planning	ahead	was	key.	She	needed	a	road	map to	ensure	the	public	events	for	the	Houston	Astro	players	were	a	success	every time	the	men	interacted	with	their	fans	and	supporters.	If	they	screwed	up,	she’d have	to	make	it	right	with	all	involved.	She’d	done	that	in	the	past—but, fortunately,	mishaps	didn’t	often	happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	majority	of	the	athletes	were	professional	in	all	aspects	of	their	career. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Including	public	relations.	One	or	two,	however…	just	overgrown	boys.	A	pair of	green	eyes	came	to	mind,	and	her	mouth	tightened	in	frustration.	Brian</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a>Delaney	had	so	much	talent	but	was	so	undependable	on	and	off	the	field.	She never	counted	on	him	showing	up	for	a	planned	event.	He	was	just	a	guy	riding on	good	looks	and	an	arm—when	he	used	it.	She	shook	her	head	at	the	waste.	If she	ever	stopped	to	think	about	what	could	go	wrong	in	her	job,	she’d	have	a meltdown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chuckling	and	dismissing	the	idea,	she	sat	in	front	of	her	computer	and	began filtering	appearance	requests.	She	loved	working	for	the	Astros,	and	she	loved her	position	as	Player	Promotions	and	Events	Coordinator.	Adding	to	her	good fortune	was	a	recent	opportunity	for	promotion	to	manager.	More	money,	more responsibility.	She’d	updated	her	resume	and	thought	she	had	a	good	shot.	In	her competitive	world,	however,	she	didn’t	count	on	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	her	desk	phone	rang,	she	saw	Dave	Evans’s	name	on	the	readout.	The team	manager.	She	and	Dave	had	a	good	rapport,	communicated	well,	but	didn’t often	overlap	in	their	functions.	Curious,	she	picked	up	the	receiver	and	leaned back	in	her	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	Megan	—	come	on	up	to	my	office	for	a	minute.	We’ve	got	a	little something	for	you,	just	up	your	alley.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We?	Okay,	you’ve	got	my	attention.	I’ll	be	right	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	fact,	she’d	run.	Cooperation	and	a	positive	attitude	were	the	keys	for	a	single mom	to	enjoy	job	security	and	support	her	son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	a	smile	on	her	face	and	a	laptop	under	her	arm,	Megan	quickly	made	her way	up	one	flight	to	the	fifth	floor	of	the	building,	historic	Union	Station,	home of	the	Astros	and	Minute	Maid	Park.	She	waved	to	Carla	Weston	in	the	outer office	and	knocked	on	Dave’s	doorframe	as	his	door	was	open.	He	waved	her	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Scott	and	Rick	are	with	us	today,”	said	Dave,	nodding	toward	the	general manager	of	the	organization	and	the	pitching	coach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	you’ve	got	me	very	curious,”	said	Megan,	after	greeting	the	men	and taking	an	available	chair.	She	was	also	a	bit	concerned.	Two	of	the	men	directly coached	players,	while	the	third	reported	to	the	owner	of	the	team.	She	didn’t	fit in	with	this	group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	glad	you	could	join	us,”	began	Dave. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>“Well,	of	course.”	She	looked	from	one	face	to	the	other.	“None	of	you	seem	too happy,	so…”	She	gulped,	a	horrible	thought	entering	her	mind.	“Am	I	in	some kind	of	trouble?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	all	spoke	at	once,	but	she	was	attuned	to	Dave’s	voice.	“Not	at	all,	Megan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	fact,	just	the	opposite.	We’ve	got	a	little	situation	with	the	team.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	with	the	team,	with	a	player,”	added	Rick,	the	pitching	coach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which,	of	course,	affects	the	team,”	added	Dave,	rubbing	his	lip,	an	action which	Megan	had	seen	over	the	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	leaned	forward,	focusing	on	these	decision-makers.	“So,	what	can	I	do	to help?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	if	that	isn’t	the	perfect	opening,”	said	Dave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	your	show,”	said	Scott	Cohen.	“I’m	here	only	to	observe.	And	report	back to	Harold.	The	club	is	not	just	a	business	to	him.	The	man	loves	the	game	and takes	an	interest	in	every	player	we’ve	got.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded.	The	team’s	owner	was	famous	for	caring	about	every	part	of	the organization,	including	the	players.	Maybe	especially	the	players.	But	she	still didn’t	know	where	this	conversation	was	heading. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rick	started	pacing.	“As	I	said,	we’ve	got	a	player…a	lot	of	talent,	but…”	He shook	his	head.	“I’m	not	getting	through	to	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	something’s	wrong,”	said	Megan,	“and	not	with	you.	My	ear	is	to	the ground.	The	pitching	lineup	appreciates	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	glance	passed	between	the	two	managers.	“Told	ya’	she’d	have	a	notion	about it,”	said	Dave.	“She	played	women’s	softball	at	University	of	Texas.	On scholarship,	too.	Made	a	name	for	herself.	She	knows	the	game.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	lump	took	root	in	her	stomach	as	a	pair	of	sparkling	green	eyes	again	came	to mind.	She	glanced	from	the	pitching	coach	to	Dave,	the	team	manager.	Might	as well	throw	the	elephant	into	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Brian	Delaney,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a>She	had	fun	watching	their	jaws	drop.	“Why	are	you	surprised?	He’s	just	as unreliable	for	public	events	as	he	is	on	the	mound.	I	obviously	have	no	clout with	him	and	am	certainly	out	of	ideas.	Sorry.”	She	began	to	rise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dave	held	up	his	hand	like	a	traffic	cop,	and	she	sat	down	again.	“Brian	Delaney is	either	brilliant	or	a	screw-up	on	the	mound.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">True.	She’d	watched	enough	games	to	see	both.	But	could	a	pro	team	afford	to have	a	clown	in	the	lineup?	Three	pair	of	eyes	were	on	her.	“What?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	can	I	do	about	him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	think	it’s	an	attitude	thing.	Not	a	skill	thing.”	Dave	steepled	his	hands, elbows	on	the	desk.	“We	want	you	to…to	be	his	handler	for	the	rest	of	the season.	Figure	out	what	makes	him	tick,	get	him	to	show	up	for	every	practice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	didn’t	look	too	happy	himself	when	he	met	her	eyes.	“Megan,	the	boss upstairs	has	a	gut	feeling	about	the	kid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feelings.	The	sport	was	built	on	feelings.	And	performance,	of	course.	She preferred	the	statistics	route	herself.	“With	all	due	respect	to	Mr.	Weber,	Brian Delaney	was	drafted	out	of	college,	so	he’s	not	a	kid	anymore,	at	least	not	in	a baseball	sense.	At	this	point,	have	you	considered	trading	him?	If	he’s	a	problem that	doesn’t	want	to	be	solved,	you	might	as	well	cut	the	team’s	losses.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dave	shook	his	head	and	leaned	toward	her	from	across	his	desk.	“We	need	him right	now.	After	last	night’s	game,	we’re	down	to	three	starters.	Damn	tendinitis! </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’re	calling	up	two	players	from	the	minors,	of	course,	so	we	have	our	roster of	five	starting	pitchers.	Delaney’s	one	of	that	five	and	the	only	left-handed	one we	have.”	He	paused,	stood	and	slapped	the	desk.	“I	repeat,	we	need	him, Megan.	It’s	either	now	or	never.	Can	we	develop	him	into	all	that	he	can	be	on the	mound,	as	well	as	help	the	team	maintain	an	honorable	standing	in	the league?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	being	pulled	under.	Hope	and	frustration	swirled	through	the	air.	Heck, they	were	all	frustrated.	But	the	men	were	looking	at	her	for	hope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	technical	training	involved,”	said	Rick.	“I’ll	handle	that,	but	with	you	in	my corner,	we	might	get	different	results.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I-I’m	not	a	miracle	worker.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>Dave	opened	a	top	drawer.	“Your	resume’s	right	here.	You’re	smart.	You’ve played	the	game,	you	majored	in	psychology	and	communications…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	held	up	her	hand.	“But	I’m	not	a	psychologist.	I	just	love	the	game!	But speaking	of…has	he	spoken	with	the	shrink	yet?	Our	sports	doc	is	really	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	knows	how	a	ball	player’s	mind	works.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dave’s	eyes	fell.	“He	won’t	go.	Says	he	doesn’t	have	a	problem.	He’s	doing	his job.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	jumped	from	her	seat.	“He	won’t	go?	Just	like	that?	For	crying	out	loud,	fine him!	Maybe	if	he’d	stop	cruising	the	clubs	every	night	and	get	some	sleep,	it would	help.	Does	he	think	he’s	Babe	Ruth?	That	guy	caroused,	but	when	he played	ball—he	played	to	win!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pacing	now,	she	wondered	why	she’d	allowed	her	own	emotions	to	kick	in.	Was it	because	she	hated	to	see	wasted	talent,	or	something	else? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	paid	fines	twice	already,	without	an	argument,”	said	Rick	quietly.	“He’s	an untapped	keg	of	potential.	If	I	only	had	the	key	to…”	his	voice	trailed	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	invested	a	ton	of	money	in	him,”	said	Scott,	the	general	manager. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Either	he	comes	through	or	I’ll	recommend	cutting	him.”	His	gaze	touched	on each	of	them.	“My	job	is	telling	Harold	the	facts	and	providing	a	well	thought-out	opinion.	In	the	end,	he’ll	make	up	his	own	mind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	don’t	want	to	cut	him.”	Dave	said	immediately.	He	glanced	at	Megan,	then looked	away,	then	back	at	her.	“There’s	one	thing	he	does	like,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	He	likes	women.	And	he	likes	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Women?	I	can	believe.”	But	liking	her?	Impossible.	Brian	Delaney	didn’t	know she	was	even	alive.	“If	the	players	like	me,	it’s	because	I	speak	their	language, and	I	don’t	waste	their	time.”	Her	voice	softened.	“And	believe	me,	I	take	their camaraderie	as	a	big	compliment.	In	general,	the	guys	trust	me.	They	come through	at	the	hospitals,	charity	events…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	three	men	nodded	in	unison,	and	Megan	fought	to	hold	back	a	chuckle	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a>sight.	Just	for	the	moment.	The	situation,	itself,	was	not	funny	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	a	hunch,	Megan,	that	you	can	pull	this	off,”	said	Dave.	“Rick	and	I would	totally	support	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	studied	each	man	now.	They	weren’t	kidding	around.	She	had	her	career	to consider.	The	possible	promotion.	And	her	reputation	as	a	professional	within the	organization.	Of	course,	soon	her	resume	would	read:	 <i class="calibre4">baby-sitter	to	spoiled</i> <i class="calibre4">brat,	Brian	Delaney. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	hunch?”	she	repeated.	“Well	then,	that’s	the	bottom	line	in	our	world,	isn’t	it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hunches,	feelings,	superstitions,	jinxes,	aligned	planets,	auras,	and	lots	of	woo-woo.”	She	smiled	to	include	herself	in	the	observation.	“I’ve	lived	with	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘hunches’	all	my	life,	too.	And	that	fool	does	have	oodles	of	talent.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	you’re	in?”	asked	Dave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	hope	his	womanizing	doesn’t	apply	to	me—or	I’m	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Agreed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	the	way,”	said	Scott,	“speaking	of	bottom	lines.	Did	we	mention	the	bonus that	goes	along	with	this	special	assignment?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sat	taller.	“I’m	all	ears,	my	friends.”	A	single	mom	never	turned	down	a chance	to	earn	overtime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ten	thou	for	the	try,	and	another	fifteen	for	the	get.	If	you	turn	him	around, Megan	Ross,	that’s	twenty-five	thousand	beyond	salary	and	holiday	bonus.”	The general	manager	was	speaking	for	the	owner.	It	seemed	everyone	was	as	serious as	death	about	this	‘assignment.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">She	slowly	exhaled	the	breath	she’d	been	holding.	Their	generosity	was	nothing to	sneeze	at.	Her	ex	was	totally	out	of	the	picture.	A	real	charmer	with	no	sense of	responsibility.	Not	unlike	Delaney,	she	supposed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	would	have	mentioned	it	earlier,”	said	Dave.	“But	we	all	played	the	same hunch	on	you,	and	we	all	won.”	His	grin	stretched	across	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	chuckled	and	shook	her	head.	“Might	have	known.”	More	than	ever,	she	felt</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>at	one	with	the	organization.	She’d	earned	their	respect	before	doing	a	day’s work	with	Delaney.	Now	she’d	have	to	retain	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">Brian	Delaney	glanced	at	his	watch	as	he	ran	up	the	five	flights	to	Dave	Evans’s office.	Three	o’clock.	And	the	game	started	at	7:05	that	night.	He	took	a	moment to	catch	his	breath	at	the	top	of	the	stairs,	content	with	the	timeframe.	He’d	be able	to	make	a	prearranged	visit	at	the	hospital	and	be	back	for	pre-game	warm up.	After	last	night’s	trouble	with	Travis	Watson’s	arm,	Brian	wanted	to	be	in good	form	that	night—for	the	team’s	sake—in	case	they	needed	him.	Actually, Brian	felt	awful	about	Travis,	too.	No	pitcher	wanted	to	be	laid	up	with tendinitis.	He’d	come	through	for	a	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	jogged	to	Dave’s	office,	called	out	a	“yo”	to	Carla	and	stopped	at	the doorway	to	stare	at	the	best	pair	of	legs	in	Houston.	So	glad	she	often	wore sundresses!	Megan	Ross	not	only	had	legs,	she	had	a	body,	face	and	a personality	to	boot.	The	total	package.	He	enjoyed	rattling	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	y’all,”	he	said,	after	knocking	on	the	door.	“Is	it	a	party?”	He	turned	to Megan.	“Good	to	see	you…I	think.	Or	am	I	in	trouble	again?”	He	paused.	“Was there	a	photo	shoot	or	something	I	missed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope,”	she	said,	shaking	her	head,	blonde	hair	swirling	on	her	shoulders.	“But we	will	be	working	together.	Why	don’t	you	have	a	seat?”	She	turned	to	Dave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	up.	Time	to	explain	the	plan.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brian	didn’t	like	the	look	that	passed	between	them,	didn’t	like	the	sound	of	the word	“plan.”	And	he	didn’t	like	the	four-to-one	odds.	He	continued	to	stand	near the	doorframe	and	leaned	against	the	wall.	His	hand	went	into	a	pocket	of	his baggy	cargo	shorts	and	cupped	one	of	the	baseballs	he	always	had	with	him.	A habit	he’d	acquired	since	moving	to	Houston. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	listened	to	the	“plan,”	he	began	to	relax.	It	had	to	be	a	joke.	He	waited until	Dave	ran	out	of	steam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	to	think,	my	ears	weren’t	even	burning	as	you	spent	all	this	time	talking about	me,”	he	began.	“Probably	because	you	were	just	having	fun.	So,	let’s	put	it to	rest.	First	of	all,	as	lovely	as	Megan	is,	I	don’t	need	a	baby-sitter.	And second,”	he	said,	stepping	further	into	the	room,	“baseball	 <i class="calibre4">is </i>	about	having	fun! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>For	the	fans	and	the	players.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	Dave	Evans’s	eyes	opened	any	wider,	they’d	pop	out.	“Do	I	look	like	I’m having	fun?”	the	man	growled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	maybe	I	can	help	you	out	there.	Help	you	relax	more.”	Brian	took	the	ball out	of	his	pocket,	then	reached	for	another	and	a	third	from	the	opposite	pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	tossed	one	ball	into	the	air,	then	added	the	second,	then	the	last.	For	thirty seconds	the	room	was	silent	as	all	eyes	watched	him	juggle	the	three	balls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“God,	his	eye-hand	coordination	is	fantastic,”	whispered	Rick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brian	smiled	inside,	kept	juggling,	and	spoke.	“I	do	take	the	game	seriously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Check	the	stats.	Don’t	I	have	the	best	record	in	the	league	for	fewest	stolen	bases allowed?”	Of	course,	he	did.	Catching	runners	was	a	hoot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	heard	mumbled	agreement	and	juggled	himself	toward	the	door.	“Sorry	to break	this	up	early,	but	I’ve	got	a	date…with	a	very	special	lady.”	His	heart squeezed	for	a	moment	as	one	by	one,	he	caught	each	ball. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning	at	the	doorway,	he	added,	“I	can’t	disappoint	her.”	He	jogged	back	to the	stairwell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">##</p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence	reigned	for	half-a-minute	after	Brian	disappeared.	Dave	spoke	first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	just	happened	here?	Does	anyone	know	what	just	happened	in	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	was	Brian	being	Brian,”	said	Megan.	“Doing	what	he	always	does—</p>
<p class="calibre1">having	fun.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	whose	expense?”	asked	Dave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	who’s	the	special	lady?”	asked	Megan.	“Maybe	she’s	the	key	to	unlocking him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	girlfriends	that	I	know	of,”	said	Rick.	“And	I’d	probably	know	if	there	was someone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ditto	that,”	said	Dave.	“His	whole	family’s	back	east	though.	His	brother’s	with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>the	Red	Sox.	Maybe	we	should’ve	drafted	him	instead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	needed	a	pitcher,	not	a	fielder,”	said	Rick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Interesting.	She	hadn’t	thought	about	his	brother	or	his	family,	for	that	matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	knew	little	about	them,	had	never	been	curious.	She	knew	the	married players’	wives	and	many	of	their	children.	They	went	to	the	games	and	most	of the	women	played	in	the	annual	wives’	softball	game	each	year,	which	she coached.	But	as	for	the	single	guys…she	didn’t	know	much.	They	seemed	more self-contained.	Or	maybe	they	just	preferred	keeping	their	private	lives…private. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	leave	you	three	to	figure	out	the	details,”	said	Scott,	“and	I’ll	brief	Harold on	our	game	plan.”	He	turned	to	Megan.	“Do	your	best,	but	don’t	make sacrifices	you	wouldn’t	ordinarily	make.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	part	of	the	team,	too,	Megan.	Play	it	safe.”	He	waved	and	left	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	second	that.	Delaney’s	a	playboy,	so	keep	your	guard	up,”	said	Dave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	concerned	for	nothing,”	said	Megan.	“I	don’t	make	the	same	mistakes twice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	got	a	great	kid,	though,”	said	Dave.	“So	that	wasn’t	a	mistake.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	son,”	Megan	began,	and	to	her	surprise,	started	choking	up,	“is	the	best child	in	the	world.”	A	new	thought	struck	her	about	this	assignment.	“I	need	to keep	Delaney	away	from	Josh.”	She	walked	back	and	forth.	“I’ll	have	to	figure out...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dave’s	hand	went	up	again.	“Slow	down	a	minute.	This	whole	project	might	not last	very	long	at	all.	Think	about	Sandy	Koufax.	It	took	him	six	years	—	six years,	Megan—before	the	whole	game	clicked	for	him	and	his	brilliance	on	the mound	showed	up	as	no-hitters	and	perfect	games.	Brian	Delaney	is	just	about	at that	same	point.”	He	looked	at	her	and	shrugged	his	shoulders.	“Maybe…?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">She	tilted	her	head	back.	“From	your	mouth	to	God’s	ears,	as	my	mom	always says.	With	Delaney,	we	really	will	need	divine	help	to	perform	an	attitude adjustment	or…should	I	say,	a	baseball	miracle?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a>“Ha!	You’re	right.	I	hope	you	have	a	direct	line	to	the	bigger	boss	upstairs.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	One	-	The	Broken	Circle</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">January	1995</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Boston</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	knock	at	her	grad	school	apartment	door	pulled	Lisa	Delaney	away	from Commonwealth	of	Massachusetts	vs.	Torcelli	Construction.	Eyes	burning,	she rubbed	her	lids	while,	from	her	iPod,	she	heard	Bryan	Adams	insist	that everything	he	did,	he	did	for	her.	Old	song.	Easy	words.	If	the	man	really	wanted to	impress,	he	could	take	her	contracts	exam	in	the	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	pushed	away	from	her	desk,	covered	in	law	books	and	case	briefs,	and	rose from	her	chair,	stretching,	bending	and	groaning.	Her	knees	creaked	like	an arthritic	old	lady’s.	Shaking	her	head,	she	emitted	a	long	sigh	and	promised herself	a	gym	visit	the	next	day—after	the	exam. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a>A	second	knock	echoed,	this	time	more	impatiently</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	coming.	Hang	on.”	Nimble	again,	she	rushed	across	the	room	and	opened the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	eyes	widened,	her	stomach	began	to	roil	as	she	looked	at	two	uniformed state	troopers,	snow	melting	on	their	jackets,	cop	faces	in	place.	Her	thoughts raced	with	possibilities.	Classmates?	Mike?	Oh,	please,	not	Mike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	Lisa	Delaney?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stared	at	bad	news	and	froze.	All	of	her.	Nothing	worked.	Not	her	mind, tongue,	or	breath.	Perhaps	her	heart	had	stopped,	too.	One	man	coughed.	The other	repeated	the	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I-I’m	Lisa.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	your	parents’	names	Robert	and	Grace	Delaney?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh,	God,	yes!	Her	heart	raced	at	Mach	speed,	but	she	couldn’t	feel	her	legs	at all.	“What	happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“May	we	come	in,	Ms.	Delaney?”	Taller	cop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded	and	pulled	the	door	wider,	but	the	knob	slipped	through	her	sweaty hands	and	she	lost	her	balance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	might	want	to	sit	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	though	moving	underwater,	she	struggled	into	the	closest	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	afraid	there’s	been	an	accident	on	the	turnpike,”	began	the	quiet-till-now officer.	“A	fatal	accident.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not…not	my…my	parents?”	She	barely	got	the	words	out	before	the	officers’</p>
<p class="calibre1">sympathetic	silence	answered	her	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	that’s	impossible!	I	just	spoke	to	my	dad…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	was	that,	ma’am?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a>When?	When?	“I	think…maybe…last…last	night….”	Her	voice	drifted.	Daddy had	been	checking	up	on	his	eldest,	his	numero	uno	child,	joking	with	her	about an	apple	a	day.	Staying	healthy.	A	convenient	excuse	to	call.	To	keep	in	touch with	the	one	who’d	left	home.	She’d	understood	his	M.O.	a	month	after	arriving at	school.	Sweet,	loving	man.	A	man	with	a	phone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wh-what…?”	Her	throat	closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cops	seemed	to	understand	her	intent.	“The	official	investigation	is	ongoing, but	according	to	preliminary	reports,	the	other	driver	lost	control	of	his	vehicle and	did	a	one-eighty.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Drunk?	But…but	it’s	the	middle	of	the	week.”	As	if	that	fact	could	change things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	driver’s	blood	alcohol	was	normal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	what…?	The	road…?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Icy	conditions	contributed.	The	temperature	drops	at	night,	and	your	folks	were approaching	at	just	the	wrong	moment.	There	were	no	survivors.	I’m	very sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded.  <i class="calibre4">No	survivors?	Mom	and	Dad? </i>	She	wanted	to	cover	her	ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	officer	looked	at	his	notes	and	said,	“The	Woodhaven	police	are	with your	brothers	and	sisters.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Oh,	God,	the	kids…	She	had	to	get	back	to	Woodhaven! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Standing	quickly,	she	was	hit	by	a	wave	of	nausea	and	fell	back	into	her	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	doubled	over,	hand	on	her	stomach.	The	phone	rang,	startling	her	further. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stared	at	the	instrument,	half-buried	by	textbooks,	reached	forward,	and slowly	lifted	the	receiver.	“Hello?”	she	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lisa!	Lisa!	The	police	are	here.	Mom	and	Dad	were	in	an	accident.	You	have	to come	home!	Now!	I’m	scared.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jennifer.	Her	social	butterfly	teenage	sister	whose	life	revolved	around boyfriends,	best	friends,	and	having	fun.	Except,	not	tonight.	In	the	background, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a>she	heard	the	cacophony	of	younger	voices	crying	and	talking	at	the	same	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	heard	little	Emily’s	high-pitched	wail.	“When	is	Lisa	coming?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hang	on,	Jen.”	She	took	a	breath	and	looked	at	the	officers.	“There	are	four	of them.	Emily’s	only	seven.	My	twin	brothers	are	nine.	Jen’s	sixteen.	I’ve	got	to get	there—a	hundred	miles—and	I	don’t	own	a	car.”	She	couldn’t	afford	one	and didn’t	need	one	in	a	city	with	mass	transit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	troopers	nodded,	and	she	spoke	into	the	phone	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	be	there	soon,	Jen.	As	soon	as	I	can.	Maybe	William	and	Irene	can	stay	with you	meanwhile.”	Her	fiancé’s	parents	lived	across	the	street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	not	home.	They	went	to	Miami	to	see	Mike	play.	Didn’t	you	watch	the game	yesterday?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	I	watched,	but	I	didn’t	know	his	folks	flew	down.”	Mike	had	subbed for	the	starting	quarterback	and	played	an	entire	quarter.	It	was	only	his	first year,	but	now	the	Riders	were	in	the	play-offs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	Jen,	you	need	to	be	in	charge	now	until	I	get	there.	You	and	the	kids	sit	tight and	wait	for	me.”	She	glanced	toward	the	window,	where	falling	snow	was reflected	by	the	light	of	the	streetlamps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	might	take	a	little	while,”	she	added.	“It’s	a	big	trip,	and	the	roads	are	bad…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	was	she	saying?	Her	parents	had	just	been	killed	on	those	roads.	“Jen, honey,	let	me	talk	to	one	of	the	officers	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	hand	shook	as	she	gave	the	receiver	to	the	state	cop.	“Ask	if	they	told	the kids	the	truth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	seconds,	he	shook	his	head.	“Not	yet.	They’re	getting	a	social	worker	in	on it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	raised	her	eyes	to	his.	“Please	tell	them	not	to	do	or	say	anything	until	I	get there.	Okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perspiration	trickled	from	every	pore.	She	shivered	and	sweated	until	finally	her stomach	lurched.	Running	into	the	bathroom,	she	vomited	until	nothing remained.	Then	she	brushed	her	teeth,	packed	her	suitcase	to	the	brim,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>snapped	it	shut.	The	sound	focused	her,	and	she	inhaled	a	deep	breath.  <i class="calibre4">Be	strong,</i> <i class="calibre4">be	strong…</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	troopers	held	the	door	open.	Her	gaze	skimmed	the	small	apartment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’d	been	happy	there	and	ecstatic	at	being	accepted	into	the	program.	She glanced	at	her	textbooks	before	locking	on	to	her	college	graduation	photo.	Her parents	stood	on	either	side	of	her,	their	smiles	wide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh-h…	One	second.”	Her	own	future	was	now	uncertain.	Dropping	her suitcase,	she	darted	to	the	wall,	took	down	the	picture,	and	tucked	it	under	her arm.	Their	dreams	and	her	dreams	might	have	to	wait	awhile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">#</p>
<p class="calibre1">Michael	Brennan	needed	three	days	to	get	home	to	Woodhaven	and	to	Lisa.	It seemed	like	three	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	tossed	his	luggage	in	his	parents’	front	hall,	turned	around,	and	headed directly	across	the	street.	The	Delaneys	lived	in	a	two-story	wood-framed	house with	a	front	porch	similar	to	his	and	to	all	the	other	homes	on	Hawthorne	Street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	grown	up	there,	but	Lisa	and	her	family	had	moved	in	over	four	years	ago in	June,	right	after	her	high	school	graduation.	He’d	graduated	from	a neighboring	high	school	that	same	year.	Their	paths	hadn’t	crossed	until	the evening	his	mother	baked	a	cake	and	insisted	their	family	welcome	the	new neighbors.	Moaning	and	groaning,	he’d	given	in,	and	the	Brennans	had	gone	to visit	the	Delaneys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Lisa	opened	the	door	and	walked	outside,	he’d	almost	tripped	up	the	front steps.	One	glance	and	he	couldn’t	speak.	His	brain	froze,	too,	as	if	a	lightning bolt	had	slammed	him	head	to	toe.	Big	violet	eyes,	long,	dark	wavy	hair,	and	a killer	smile.	A	friendly	smile.  <i class="calibre4">Who	wouldn’t	have	fallen	in	love	with	her? </i>	But he’d	been	the	lucky	one,	the	lucky	guy	who’d	relished	every	single	day	since Lisa	Delaney	had	first	appeared	at	that	front	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	her	sidewalk	needed	shoveling.	The	streets	had	been	plowed	since	the storm	a	few	days	ago,	the	walkways,	too,	but	snow	had	fallen	again	yesterday, and	surfaces	had	turned	icy.	He	flexed	his	shoulders	and	entered	the	house.	He’d take	care	of	the	snow	after	he	wrapped	his	arms	around	her…if	he	could	find	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Delaney	house	was	packed.	He	recognized	Lisa’s	aunts	and	uncles	from	out</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a>of	-town,	and	all	the	neighbors,	of	course.	Lisa’s	closest	friends,	Sandy	and	Gail, were	there,	too.	Either	they’d	stayed	all	day	or	had	just	come	from	work.	He waved	and	searched	for	his	mom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s	Lisa?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	glad	you’re	here,	Michael,”	she	said,	giving	him	a	quick	kiss,	“but	don’t expect	too	much	from	Lisa.	She’s	overwhelmed	as…as	we	all	are.”	Irene Brennan	gazed	up	at	the	ceiling,	indicating	the	second	floor.	“She’s	got	the	kids with	her.	The	funeral’s	tomorrow,	and	she	wants	time	alone	with	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alone	doesn’t	include	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	took	the	stairs	two	at	a	time,	sensing	the	glances,	the	sympathy	of	the	visitors as	he	made	his	way	up.	He	appreciated	their	support,	but	they	didn’t	have	to worry.	Surely,	he	could	handle	whatever	he	found.	Surely,	he	and	Lisa	could handle	it	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	paused	in	the	hallway	at	the	top	of	the	stairs.	Each	of	the	four	bedroom	doors stood	ajar,	but	he	could	hear	nothing.	He	started	to	push	the	first	door	open when,	from	the	end	of	the	corridor,	he	heard	Lisa	singing	quietly,	“Too-ra	Loo-ra Loo-ra,	Too-ra	loo-ra	lie…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Was	she	trying	to	put	the	kids	to	sleep	at	five	o’clock	in	the	afternoon?	He slowed	his	pace	and	walked	the	last	few	steps	before	knocking	softly	and entering	the	master	bedroom.	Lisa	sat	on	her	parents’	bed,	leaning	against	the headboard,	the	twins	dozing	on	either	side	of	her,	little	Emily	sleeping	on	her lap.	Jennifer	lay	across	the	foot	of	the	bed,	also	sound	asleep.	He	took	it	all	in and	understood	that	day	and	night	had	no	meaning	to	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lisa...”	A	whispered	prayer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	red-rimmed	eyes	brightened,	her	arms	opened,	and	he	was	there.	Kissing	her and	gently	shifting	one	little	brother	lower	on	the	mattress.	She	began	to	cry,	her tears	mingling	with	his	as	he	rained	kisses,	and	his	tension	melted	simply	by holding	her	in	his	arms.	Tears	flowed	as	he	continued	to	embrace	her	and	grieve while	remembering	Grace	and	Robert	Delaney. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’d	been	wonderful	neighbors,	wonderful	parents,	and	good	friends	with	his folks.	The	Delaneys	had	worked	so	hard	to	finally	become	“owners”	instead	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a>“renters,”	and	celebrated	their	move	to	Hawthorne	Street	each	time	they’d	made a	mortgage	payment.	Lisa	had	told	him	how	her	dad	would	brandish	the	check and	twirl	Grace	around	the	kitchen	every	single	month.	With	their	growing family,	it	had	taken	them	fifteen	years	to	afford	their	own	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	long	can	you	stay?”	Lisa	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	can’t,”	mumbled	nine-year-old	Andy,	rousing	slightly.	“He	has	to	go	to	the conference	championship	game.	And	maybe	to	the	Super	Bowl.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	not	yet,”	Mike	said,	rubbing	the	boy’s	head	with	affection,	but	focusing	his gaze	on	Lisa.	“I’ll	be	here	for	the	funeral	tomorrow.	You	won’t	be	alone.	Then I’ll	be	back	in	a	week.	One	short	week.”	Which	might	feel	like	an	eternity	to Lisa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	glad,	but-but	everything	has	changed,”	she	said,	pulling	a	tissue	from	the nearby	box	and	blotting	her	face.	“We	need	to	rethink	our	plans.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	basics	haven’t	changed,”	he	replied	quickly.	“I	love	you,	Lisa	Delaney. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	don’t	you	forget	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	eyes	shone.	She	pressed	his	hand,	her	fingers	narrow	and	delicate	around	his broader	ones.	“I	love	you,	too,	but-but….”	She	sighed	and	glanced	at	the assorted	children.	“I’m	not	sure	what’s	going	to	happen	next,”	she	said	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am,”	he	said.	“I’m	going	to	kiss	you	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	he	did.	When	she	kissed	him	back,	when	she	lingered	and	leaned	against him,	he	almost	collapsed	with	relief.	She	was	 <i class="calibre4">the	one </i>	for	him.	No	matter	what. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	needs,	the	kids’	needs…. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	sort	it	out	when	the	time	comes,”	he	said.	“I’ll	support	you	in	every	way	I can.”	The	logistics	would	no	doubt	be	complicated,	but	he	had	faith	that	he	and Lisa	could	do	anything	as	long	as	they	did	it	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	offered	a	wan	smile.	“I	know	you’ll	do	your	best,	but	you	have commitments	to	the	team.	You’re	so	talented!	We	all	know	you’re	being groomed	as	a	starting	quarterback,	maybe	even	next	year.	So	I	think,	for	both	our sakes,	I	need	to	handle	this-this	family	situation	by	myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p171"></a>No,	she	didn’t,	but	her	brave	effort	tore	a	corner	of	his	heart.	“I	think	you’re right	about	my	place	in	the	team,”	he	said	slowly,	“but	that’s	in	our	favor.	The money’s	good.”	He’d	worked	hard	with	his	coaches,	and	his	natural	talents	had been	recognized.	His	dream	career	loomed	just	over	the	horizon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	must	be	weird,”	said	Lisa.	“I	never	think	about	your	salary.	Even	your	first year	minimum	is	like	make-believe	Monopoly	money	to	me.	It	doesn’t	matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	just	so…so	proud	of	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Men	cry.	Even	big	football	players.	But	once	that	afternoon	was	enough.	His throat	ached	as	he	swallowed	to	stem	more	tears.	Lisa	needed	him	to	be	strong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have	I	ever	told	you	about	my	conversation	with	your	dad	at	the	end	of	the summer	you	moved	to	Hawthorne	Street?”	he	asked.	“It	was	right	before	I	went off	to	Ohio	State	on	my	scholarship.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	Daddy	told	me	was	that	you	were	too	big	for	your	britches,	but	he	was laughing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	surge	of	love	and	a	wave	of	sadness—both	raced	through	Mike.	The	words sounded	exactly	like	something	Rob	Delaney	would	say.	And	the	laughter–well, laughter	was	the	norm	in	Lisa’s	family.	Her	dad	loved	to	tell	a	good	story	and could	imitate	the	comedy	greats	and	their	jokes.	Rob	had	been	a	natural	“on stage,”	and	no	one	had	a	bigger	heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Before	I	left	for	college,”	Mike	continued,	“I	told	him	I	was	going	to	marry	you someday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	got	to	be	kidding!	We	were	only	eighteen.	We’d	just	met	that	very summer.”	For	a	moment,	her	expression	lightened.	She	tipped	her	head	back,	and her	eyes	met	his.	“And	what	did	he	say?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	said	that	I’d	better	treat	you	like	gold—always.	And	I	promised	I	would.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“O-o-h….”	Despair	once	again	etched	her	face.	“Our	lives…	everything...”—she waved	her	arm—	“has	changed.	I	can’t-I	 <i class="calibre4">won’t </i>	hold	you	to	any	promise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	no	vote.”	He	kissed	her	again,	vowing	to	keep	that	promise.	Loving Lisa	was	the	easy	part.	Building	a	solid	future	together…well,	that	goal	might	be more	difficult	to	reach	now.	Lisa	was	in	no	condition	to	make	any	decisions. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a>Their	next	steps	would	be	decided	by	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	gaze	rested	on	each	of	the	youngsters,	one	at	a	time.	Four	sweet,	innocent children.	Without	warning,	his	heart	started	to	race,	and	his	palms	became covered	in	sweat.	Fear.	Like	Lisa,	he	was	almost	twenty-three,	and	deep	down, he	was	scared,	too.	He	had	no	experience	with	kids,	not	even	a	younger	brother or	sister.	But	he	wouldn’t	give	himself	away,	wouldn’t	let	Lisa	know.	A quarterback	led	with	confidence	on	the	field.	Now	he	had	to	do	the	same	at home. </p>
