<p class="calibre1"><a id="p6"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	One</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 was	 an	 ancient	 place,	 remote	 and	 desolate.	 Peaceful,	 yet	 witness	 to centuries	 of	 warmongering,	 standing	 ready	 to	 do	 its	 duty.	 A	 never-ending	 vigil set	to	the	rhythmic	rise	and	fall	of	the	ocean. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	only	a	matter	of	time	before	all	this	would	be	swept	away.	The	castle’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">resolute	 defences	 were	 imperceptibly	 weakened	 by	 every	 breaking	 wave, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sweeping	in	from	the	Channel,	sent	crashing	against	the	groynes	and	stones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	pale	sun	rose	silently	and	unnoticed	over	Hurst	Castle.	Shadows	stretching</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	 the	 rippled	 tidal	 waters	 that	 all	 but	 surrounded	 it,	 bar	 a	 narrow	 finger	 of shingle	linking	the	fortifications	to	the	mainland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hurst’s	 seventy-four	 occupants	 were	 slumbering	 in	 their	 quarters.	 The	 more recent	arrivals	were	camped	out	in	the	east	wing.	Tents	pitched	where	grass	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">space	allowed.	In	the	dorm	room	in	the	main	building,	a	shaft	of	sunlight	pierced</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	makeshift	curtains.	Two	grey	blankets	strung	across	the	large	stone	window</p>
<p class="calibre1">aperture	prolonged	the	darkness.	The	shaft	of	light	fell	across	the	pillow	of	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	iron-framed	beds,	bathing	the	unshaven	face	of	a	man	in	white	light	as	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">began	to	wake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	stretched	and	yawned,	looking	around	at	his	companions.	Packed	tightly</p>
<p class="calibre1">together,	a	sleeping	mass	of	washed-up	humanity	snored	gently.	There	was	a	low</p>
<p class="calibre1">snuffle	 of	 someone	 stirring	 in	 the	 corner,	 heavy	 breathing	 and	 the	 universal stench	 of	 unwashed	 bodies	 and	 morning	 breath.	 From	 outside	 came	 the	 low</p>
<p class="calibre1">sound	of	waves	breaking	gently	over	the	rocks	and	shingle	spit,	seagulls	soaring</p>
<p class="calibre1">above	 the	 castle	 that	 spoke	 of	 a	 new	 morning,	 bringing	 with	 it	 new	 hope.	 For many,	the	sounds	reminded	them	of	former	lives,	holidays	by	the	seaside,	long-forgotten	memories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	base	need	to	breathe	fresh	air	and	enjoy	the	peace	of	the	castle	in	the	early</p>
<p class="calibre1">dawn	 compelled	 Zed	 to	 take	 his	 morning	 constitutional	 walk.	 He	 was	 fond	 of rising	before	anyone	else	was	up	and	having	the	place	to	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stepping	outside,	he	squinted,	shading	his	eyes,	taking	a	moment	to	bathe	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">face	 in	 the	 sunshine,	 inhaling	 deeply	 the	 sea	 air.	 His	 hair	 was	 unkempt	 and unwashed,	long	sideburns	grew	down	his	cheeks	and	a	tuft	of	hair	stuck	upright. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wore	a	grubby	T-shirt	with	chest-high	salt	stains	from	unloading	stores	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	visiting	fishing	boat	the	previous	day.	He	had	the	air	of	someone	who	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>after	himself,	a	loner,	a	survivor	with	the	scars	to	prove	it.	It	wasn’t	that	he	didn’t enjoy	the	company	of	others;	he	did.	But	when	push	came	to	shove,	he	had	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	for	the	weak.	Survive	or	die.	Get	in	his	way	and	face	the	consequences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaving	the	castle	keep	and	its	cold	grey	stone	walls,	he	meandered	sleepily, </p>
<p class="calibre1">still	yawning,	through	the	Tudor	archway.	Beyond	the	gate	was	a	narrow	strip	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">grass	that	stretched	for	one	hundred	metres	or	so	to	the	western	walls	of	the	fort, extended	 in	 Victorian	 times.	 A	 large	 marquee	 dominated	 the	 interior.	 Half	 a dozen	smaller	tents	were	pitched	haphazardly	around	it.	Passing	the	canteen	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">took	 the	 stairs	 two	 at	 a	 time.	 Up	 on	 to	 the	 raised	 walkway	 and	 ramparts,	 he looked	south-west	across	the	narrow	channel	towards	the	Isle	of	Wight	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Needles	 rocks.	 There	 was	 still	 a	 faint	 haze	 that	 shrouded	 the	 island	 in	 a	 light mist,	slowly	evaporating	as	the	shadows	shortened	on	the	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scanning	 the	 horizon	 across	 the	 salt	 marshes	 towards	 Keyhaven,	 a	 pair	 of swans	 glided	 gracefully	 against	 the	 incoming	 tide	 within	 the	 sheltered	 estuary that	lay	behind	a	narrow	shingle	spit.	As	he	turned	to	look	back	along	the	raised</p>
<p class="calibre1">roadway	 that	 ran	 on	 top	 of	 the	 shingle,	 the	 movement	 of	 a	 dark	 shape	 in	 the distance	interrupted	his	gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 figure	 was	 limping	 awkwardly.	 A	 long	 heavy	 coat	 several	 sizes	 too	 big was	draped	around	its	shoulders.	On	the	castle	walls	Zed	reached	for	the	pair	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">binoculars	 that	 lived	 in	 a	 large	 blue	 plastic	 IKEA	 storage	 box	 under	 the	 bench seat.	He	took	a	couple	of	seconds	to	find	and	focus	on	the	man	in	the	distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 no	 question.	 What	 had	 first	 appeared	 as	 a	 limp	 was	 more	 severe	 in focus,	 the	 left	 leg	 dragging	 heavily	 on	 the	 shingle,	 scraping	 at	 each	 step.	 His progress	 was	 laboured,	 but	 he	 showed	 no	 sign	 of	 discomfort	 or	 pain	 as	 he approached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 lowered	 the	 binoculars	 and	 squinted	 with	 his	 bare	 eyes.	 The	 hint	 of	 a smile	 appeared	 on	 Zed’s	 lips.	 He	 reached	 back	 into	 the	 blue	 container	 and brought	 up	 a	 hunting	 rifle.	 Loading	 a	 single	 bullet	 into	 the	 breach,	 he	 took careful	aim	at	the	man	in	the	distance.	Adjusting	his	position	a	couple	of	times, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	relaxed	into	a	wide	stance,	the	rifle	resting	on	the	edge	of	the	brick	wall.	The cross	 hairs	 of	 the	 telescopic	 sight	 danced	 around	 the	 head	 of	 the	 approaching figure.	 He	 was	 still	 perhaps	 two	 hundred	 metres	 away	 now,	 making	 steady</p>
<p class="calibre1">progress.	Zed	regulated	his	breathing	before	exhaling	deeply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 rifle	 shot	 rang	 out	 across	 Christchurch	 Bay,	 echoing	 around	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">battlements,	shattering	the	silence	of	the	early	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 flock	 of	 birds	 rose	 startled	 from	 the	 salt	 marshes.	 In	 the	 fenced-off	 field next	 to	 the	 lighthouse,	 a	 herd	 of	 dairy	 cows	 flinched,	 wild-eyed	 and	 bumping into	each	other.	The	two	horses	bolted.	One	jumped	over	the	low	wire	fence	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">charged	away	from	the	noise,	its	hooves	clattering	on	the	pebbles	as	it	galloped</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>along	the	beach. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Two</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">From	 the	 castle	 entrances,	 startled	 figures	 emerged	 from	 their	 slumber,	 still rubbing	 their	 eyes,	 alarmed	 by	 the	 single	 shot.	 There	 had	 been	 no	 bell	 to	 warn the	 inhabitants	 of	 an	 imminent	 threat.	 Two	 men	 raced	 towards	 the	 stairs	 to	 the western	ramparts,	clutching	their	boots	and	clothes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 ignored	 the	 commotion	 behind	 him,	 cursing	 his	 luck	 as	 the	 figure</p>
<p class="calibre1">continued	 its	 slow	 methodical	 lurch	 towards	 the	 castle,	 unharmed	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">undeterred.	Its	pace	seemed	to	quicken.	The	first	shot	had	gone	high	and	right, </p>
<p class="calibre1">splintering	a	rock	over	the	man’s	shoulder.	Zed	hurriedly	reloaded	the	rifle.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">adjusted	his	aim	slightly	to	the	left	to	account	for	the	light	breeze	coming	across the	bay	from	the	island.	Wrapping	the	rifle	strap	tightly	around	his	left	arm,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">steadied	 the	 barrel	 against	 the	 raised	 concrete	 and	 fired	 again.	 This	 time	 the figure’s	 head	 rocked	 back	 violently,	 before	 collapsing	 onto	 the	 shingle, </p>
<p class="calibre1">twitching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those	who	had	ignored	the	first	shot	and	passed	it	off	as	something	else	now</p>
<p class="calibre1">sat	 bolt	 upright.	 Muffled	 cries	 of	 alarm	 could	 be	 heard	 throughout	 the	 castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Raised	 voices	 joined	 together	 as	 people	 emerged	 from	 every	 door	 and	 tent	 to congregate	 in	 the	 courtyard	 pointing	 towards	 the	 suspected	 source.	 Zed’s	 back was	 turned,	 silhouetted	 on	 the	 ramparts,	 the	 rifle	 hitched	 on	 his	 hip	 like	 a triumphant	hunter. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
Still	buttoning	his	shirt	and	rubbing	the	sleep	from	his	eyes,	Jack	hurried	towards<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">the	 base	 of	 the	 wooden	 staircase,	 breathing	 heavily	 from	 his	 race	 across	 the courtyard.	 A	 Royal	 Navy	 issue	 blue	 sweater	 with	 elbow	 patches	 had	 ridden	 up exposing	 a	 neat	 potbelly.	 His	 thinning	 hair	 was	 wild,	 his	 brow	 furrowed	 with concern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	the	hell’s	going	on?”	shouted	Jack	from	below,	squinting	up	at	Zed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	didn’t	respond,	but	muttered	something	under	his	breath	that	Jack	didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">catch.	The	older	man	took	the	stairs	two	at	a	time,	his	limbs	stiff	and	sore	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">yesterday’s	exertions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	others	stepped	aside	to	let	their	leader	pass.	Jack	stood	panting,	fighting</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	catch	his	breath.	He	snatched	the	binoculars	from	Zed	and	slowly	scanned	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>shingle	 spit,	 trying	 to	 locate	 the	 body.	 Shaking	 his	 head,	 he	 grabbed	 the	 rifle from	Zed’s	grasp	and	put	it	back	in	the	storage	box. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	was	unarmed.	Why	did	you	have	to	shoot	him?”	asked	Jack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	stared	back	at	him,	defiantly.	“He	was	infected.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 was	 aware	 of	 a	 gathering	 crowd	 watching	 their	 exchange.	 He	 felt</p>
<p class="calibre1">compelled	to	act,	shaking	his	head.	“Every	living	soul	for	miles	around	will	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard	that	shot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shame	there’s	no	one	left	alive	to	hear	it	then,”	said	Zed	with	a	wry	smile, </p>
<p class="calibre1">unrepentant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 laughed,	 but	 there	 was	 no	 hint	 of	 humour	 in	 his	 demeanour.	 Inside	 he was	 seething,	 but	 trying	 to	 keep	 a	 cool	 head.	 “We	 don’t	 know	 that.	 Next	 time, why	don’t	you	hand	out	invitations,	put	up	signs…”	Jack	turned	to	address	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">others.	 “How	 many	 times?	 How	 many	 times	 have	 we	 talked	 about	 this?	 We</p>
<p class="calibre1">agreed	 no	 guns	 for	 a	 reason.	 We	 don’t	 want	 to	 attract	 attention.	 Warning	 shot only	 if	 they	 don’t	 get	 the	 message.	 If	 it’s	 only	 one	 of	 them,	 don’t	 waste	 the bullet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	 keeping	 my	 eye	 in.”	 Zed	 smirked,	 refusing	 to	 back	 down	 or	 admit	 he was	in	the	wrong.	“I	haven’t	fired	a	shot	for	days.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 there’s	 a	 damn	 good	 reason	 for	 that.	 We	 don’t	 have	 ammo	 to	 waste. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	 know	 that.	 There	 are	 precious	 few	 bullets	 left	 for	 that	 rifle,	 then	 what? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Congratulations,	 Zed,	 you	 just	 volunteered	 yourself	 to	 lead	 today’s	 scavenging party.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anything	to	get	out	of	here	for	a	few	hours.”	Zed	eyeballed	the	older	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	wandering	off	to	find	something	to	eat.	The	first	smoke	from	the	canteen</p>
<p class="calibre1">drifted	towards	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	red-haired	woman	appeared	below,	her	head	part-covered	with	a	bandana, </p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 face	 pale,	 drawn	 and	 anxious,	 still	 buttoning	 up	 a	 man’s	 shirt	 several	 sizes too	big	for	her.	She	raced	up	the	stairs	to	join	Jack	and	the	group	on	the	raised</p>
<p class="calibre1">walkway.	 Passing	 Zed	 halfway	 up	 the	 stairs	 she	 paused	 to	 stare	 at	 him	 as	 he brushed	past	her.	She	waited	for	an	explanation,	but	he	ignored	her	puzzled	look</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	reproach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 was	 it?”	 asked	 Terra,	 catching	 her	 breath,	 watching	 Jack	 peering</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	his	binoculars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hard	to	tell	from	here,”	said	Jack,	squinting,	“but	looks	like	he	was	infected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Been	a	while	since	one	made	it	all	the	way	out	here	along	the	shingle.	We	saw	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">few	in	town	yesterday,	so	maybe	he	followed	our	trail.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	 did	 Zed	 have	 to	 shoot	 him,	 for	 God’s	 sake?	 Couldn’t	 he	 have	 just</p>
<p class="calibre1">warned	him	off?	Told	him	to	go	away?”	said	Terra	naively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 really	 think	 harsh	 language	 would	 have	 made	 him	 turn	 around?	 They</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Not	before	that	shot	will	have	drawn	every	living	soul	for	miles	around.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or	 unliving,	 you	 mean…”	 said	 Tommy,	 a	 gangly	 adolescent	 standing</p>
<p class="calibre1">nearby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	Tommy,	our	resident	comedian.	Perhaps	you’d	be	so	kind	as	to	roll	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cart	out	and	dispose	of	that	body	before	we	sit	down	for	breakfast.	Take	young</p>
<p class="calibre1">Samuel	to	help.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,	no	problem,	Skip,”	said	Tommy	with	a	hint	of	mockery,	punching	Sam</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nice	one,	dickhead,”	mumbled	Sam	under	his	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	others	drifted	off	to	find	breakfast,	Terra	remained	behind	with	Jack, </p>
<p class="calibre1">looking	 back	 over	 the	 camp	 towards	 the	 lighthouse	 and	 beyond	 towards</p>
<p class="calibre1">Southampton.	In	the	distance,	Fawley	Oil	Refinery	belched	smoke	hundreds	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">feet	 into	 the	 air	 leaving	 a	 grey	 smear	 across	 the	 morning	 skyline.	 A	 burst pipeline	or	perhaps	a	storage	container	left	to	burn.	There	was	no	one	left	to	put</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	out.	It	would	burn	until	the	oil	ran	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 we	 wouldn’t	 give	 for	 a	 few	 hundred	 gallons	 of	 diesel	 for	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">generator,”	said	Terra	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	drained	every	garage	and	farm	for	miles	around,	but	we’ll	find	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don’t	you	worry,”	reassured	Jack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 elbows	 touched	 Terra’s	 as	 they	 both	 leaned	 over	 the	 railing.	 A</p>
<p class="calibre1">comfortable	 silence	 passed	 between	 them.	 They	 watched	 the	 camp	 below	 as	 it came	 to	 life.	 Hurst’s	 inhabitants	 busied	 themselves	 with	 washing,	 preparing food,	 stitching	 and	 sewing,	 feeding	 the	 animals	 and	 generally	 cleaning	 up	 the night	before.	It	was	a	hive	of	organised	activity.	Everyone	played	their	part. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terra	turned	her	head	towards	Jack	and	smiled.	“You	need	to	get	a	handle	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	Zed.	He	sets	a	bad	example.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,	Terra.	I’ll	talk	to	him,	okay?	He’s	never	going	to	change	though,	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">know	that.	His	heart’s	in	the	right	place,	but	he	does	things	his	own	way.	I	don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">want	 to	 drive	 him	 away.	 He’s	 one	 of	 the	 best	 scavengers	 we’ve	 got.	 We	 need him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 fights	 for	 himself,	 Jack.	 He’d	 turn	 on	 you	 in	 a	 moment	 if	 you	 got between	him	and	his	prize.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 wrong,	 Terra.	 His	 loyalties	 are	 very	 much	 with	 us.	 He’s	 just	 got	 a case	of	cabin	fever,	cooped	up	here	for	too	long.	That’s	all.	Will	do	him	good	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	 out	 and	 about.”	 Jack	 wrinkled	 his	 nose,	 sniffing	 at	 the	 wind.	 There	 was something	 foul	 in	 the	 air,	 downwind	 of	 the	 latrines.	 “He	 thinks	 we	 should	 be doing	 more	 to	 form	 alliances	 with	 the	 other	 survivor	 groups	 inland	 from	 here, that	 we	 have	 our	 heads	 in	 the	 sand.”	 He	 shook	 his	 head.	 “I’ve	 said	 it’s	 too</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>dangerous.	We	don’t	want	to	go	stirring	up	a	hornet’s	nest	and	draw	attention	to ourselves.	He	doesn’t	agree.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	need	to	keep	an	eye	on	him.	That’s	all	I’m	saying,”	she	said,	stroking</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack’s	arm	affectionately.	“Same	goes	for	Riley.	I	don’t	trust	either	of	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	cleared	his	throat,	intrigued	by	Terra’s	views	on	two	of	his	most	trusted</p>
<p class="calibre1">lieutenants.	 “Don’t	 you	 worry	 about	 Zed.	 He’s	 just	 a	 big	 kid.	 His	 bark’s	 worse than	his	bite.	Reminds	me	of	my	lad	Jason.	Bless	him.”	There	was	a	distant	look</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	Jack’s	eye	as	he	was	reminded	of	his	son.	He	hadn’t	thought	of	him	in	months</p>
<p class="calibre1">now.	It	was	just	too	painful.	“Just	needs	a	firm	hand	and	a	kick	in	the	backside</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	time	to	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 beamed	 a	 broad	 smile	 and	 playfully	 nudged	 Terra	 in	 the	 ribs.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">wandered	off	to	eat,	leaving	her	alone	to	digest	his	response. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Three</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Out	 on	 the	 shingle,	 Tommy	 and	 Sam	 pushed	 the	 low-slung	 cart	 towards	 the crumpled	heap	in	the	distance.	The	tyres	needed	some	air.	Tommy	was	trying	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	light	of	their	task,	but	Sam	was	having	none	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 did	 you	 have	 to	 go	 and	 say	 that	 for?	 Now	 I’m	 stuck	 here	 with	 you when	I	could	be	having	breakfast,”	grumbled	Sam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 quit	 your	 whining,	 will	 you?	 It’s	 not	 like	 you	 haven’t	 got	 me	 into trouble	before.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 joking,	 aren’t	 you?	 I’m	 always	 covering	 for	 you,”	 continued	 Sam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyway,	what	did	Zed	have	to	go	and	shoot	the	guy	for?	What	was	he	going	to</p>

<p class="calibre1">“The	state	he	was	probably	in,	he	was	on	his	last	legs,	anyway.	If	you	ask	me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	did	him	a	favour.	Put	him	out	of	his	misery.	Saved	him	a	long	walk	back	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">whichever	hellhole	he	came	from.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	shook	his	head.	He	didn’t	agree	with	violence,	unless	there	was	no	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	took	both	of	them	to	push	the	cart	up	the	small	slope	and	along	the	raised</p>
<p class="calibre1">roadway	 that	 joined	 Hurst	 Castle	 to	 the	 mainland.	 Roadway	 was	 perhaps	 too grand	for	what	it	really	was.	In	truth,	it	was	no	more	than	a	man-made	shingle</p>
<p class="calibre1">bank,	 reinforced	 with	 concrete	 and	 strengthened	 periodically	 to	 keep	 out	 the worst	of	the	weather.	South-westerly	storms	had	a	habit	of	battering	this	stretch</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 coastline,	 washing	 away	 whole	 sections.	 But	 that	 hadn’t	 happened	 for	 years now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 shingle	 was	 just	 wide	 enough	 for	 a	 Land	 Rover	 or	 four-wheel	 drive</p>
<p class="calibre1">vehicle.	In	the	early	days,	they	had	shuttled	stores	to	the	castle	from	local	shops but	now	it	was	too	dangerous,	for	fear	of	ambush	by	rival	groups.	Supplies	came</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	boat	from	the	island	or	trade	with	the	network	of	Solent	forts	which	formed</p>
<p class="calibre1">part	 of	 the	 wider	 coastal	 defences	 built	 almost	 five	 hundred	 years	 ago	 by	 King Henry	VIII	to	defend	the	south	coast	against	invasion	by	the	French.	Today	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">same	forts,	or	at	least	those	modernised	and	fit	for	habitation,	had	formed	a	loose alliance	 to	 work	 together	 where	 possible.	 They	 exchanged	 goods	 and	 skills, occasionally	joining	forces	to	form	raiding	parties	when	making	scavenging	runs</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	local	towns.	It	was	safer	that	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>Once	at	the	top	of	the	slope,	Tommy	jumped	into	the	cart,	laughing	as	they bounced	along.	He	had	known	Sam	since	school.	Sam	had	never	truly	forgiven</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	for	stealing	the	love	of	his	life,	Sarah,	who	worked	at	the	local	dairy.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">“mates	 is	 mates”	 and	 their	 friendship	 was	 strong	 enough	 to	 get	 over	 that	 little wrinkle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy’s	 old	 man	 had	 run	 the	 local	 butcher	 on	 the	 high	 street	 for	 eleven years	until	he	got	sick	with	throat	cancer	and	died	the	following	year.	While	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother	 mourned,	 Tommy	 had	 grown	 up	 fast	 and	 volunteered	 to	 take	 over	 the family	 business,	 setting	 aside	 his	 aspirations	 for	 apprenticeships	 and	 further education.	It	was	his	way	of	treasuring	the	memory	of	his	father.	When	he	closed</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 eyes,	 he	 could	 still	 picture	 him	 standing	 behind	 the	 counter	 in	 his	 striped apron,	 smiling	 at	 customers.	 He	 remembered	 the	 old-fashioned	 bell	 that	 rung when	the	door	was	pushed	open,	the	tiled	floor	covered	in	sawdust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	two	other	young	lads	who	helped	out	in	busy	periods	and	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">weekends.	 It	 had	 been	 an	 uneasy	 working	 relationship.	 Tommy	 was	 only</p>
<p class="calibre1">nineteen,	no	more	than	a	year	or	two	older,	yet	Tommy	was	a	fair	boss.	He	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">firm	 when	 he	 needed	 to	 be,	 like	 when	 they	 turned	 up	 late	 or	 when	 one	 wasn’t pulling	his	weight.	He	always	made	a	point	of	buying	his	workers	drinks	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">end	of	the	week	on	a	Friday	night	in	their	local	pub.	It’s	what	his	father	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	wanted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	had	been	a	pillar	of	support	when	Tommy’s	dad	was	enduring	the	daily</p>
<p class="calibre1">torment	 of	 chemotherapy,	 growing	 weaker	 by	 the	 day.	 He	 used	 to	 come	 round with	 a	 four-pack,	 a	 party	 bag	 of	 Doritos,	 and	 play	 FIFA	 Football	 on	 the PlayStation	 to	 cheer	 up	 his	 friend.	 Sam	 was	 the	 strong	 silent	 type,	 with	 an intelligent	thoughtful	look	about	him.	He	was	a	good	and	loyal	mate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back	 then,	 Tommy	 still	 lived	 at	 home	 with	 his	 mum.	 Just	 the	 two	 of	 them once	they’d	buried	his	father.	She	had	become	withdrawn	after	his	father’s	death, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 if	 her	 pilot	 light	 had	 been	 dimmed	 by	 the	 months	 of	 caring,	 knowing	 that nothing	 could	 save	 her	 childhood	 sweetheart.	 Her	 days	 were	 lost	 in	 reverie,	 an air	 of	 melancholy	 settled	 on	 her	 every	 thought	 and	 deed.	 Tommy	 was	 the	 only one	who	could	still	make	her	smile	and	restore	something	of	her	former	cheery</p>
<p class="calibre1">self. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	Millennial	Virus	had	first	struck,	his	mum	was	among	the	first	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">fall.	He	suspected	her	job	at	the	chemist	was	to	blame,	through	regular	contact</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	sick.	But	in	reality,	the	virus	had	struck	seemingly	at	random	and	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 speed	 of	 wildfire.	 It	 was	 all	 over	 mercifully	 quickly	 for	 his	 mum.	 He	 had taken	 her	 to	 A&amp;E	 but	 the	 place	 was	 like	 a	 refugee	 camp.	 After	 a	 cursory	 look from	 a	 distracted	 nurse,	 they	 had	 sent	 her	 home	 with	 painkillers	 to	 get	 some sleep.	By	morning,	she	was	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>Sam’s	 quick	 thinking	 had	 saved	 both	 of	 their	 lives.	 That	 fateful	 morning Tommy	had	been	woken	by	the	blare	of	a	car	horn.	Staggering	downstairs	in	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">dressing	gown	after	a	sleepless	night,	he	unlocked	the	front	door,	eyes	bloodshot, </p>
<p class="calibre1">nose	red	from	blowing,	to	find	his	best	friend	gesticulating	wildly	and	shouting</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	the	half-lowered	window	for	him	to	get	dressed	and	get	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	had	seen	the	morning	news	and	driven	straight	round.	Panic	had	started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 emergency	 services	 were	 being	 overrun.	 Cities	 were	 emptying	 as	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sickness	spread.	Lines	of	cars	blocked	exits.	A	tide	of	humanity	staggered	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 weight	 of	 its	 worldly	 possessions.	 People	 carried	 what	 they	 could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Impractical	valuables	soon	to	be	discarded.	Irrelevant	and	redundant	in	a	world</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned	on	its	head.	A	litter	of	suitcases	abandoned	on	the	side	of	the	road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	had	packed	a	rucksack	in	two	minutes	flat	with	some	clothes,	a	torch, </p>
<p class="calibre1">food	and	water.	They	had	driven	to	the	seafront,	running	through	their	options. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where	could	they	go?	Where	was	safe?	In	the	end,	they	drove	back	to	the	house, </p>
<p class="calibre1">locked	 the	 door	 and	 perched	 nervously	 on	 the	 edge	 of	 the	 sofa	 watching	 BBC</p>
<p class="calibre1">News	24.	Clutching	a	can	of	lager	at	ten	in	the	morning,	Tommy	kept	repeating</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself	in	disbelief	every	two	minutes,	to	the	annoyance	of	his	friend.	The	pair</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	watched	with	increasing	alarm,	batting	theories	around	about	Ebola	or	bird</p>
<p class="calibre1">flu.	Whatever	it	was,	it	looked	really	bad.	The	authorities	were	doing	their	best</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 contain	 the	 outbreak,	 telling	 people	 to	 stay	 indoors	 and	 avoid	 contact	 with others.	A	succession	of	health	experts	argued	about	cause	and	origin.	Some	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 was	 a	 strain	 of	 avian	 flu.	 Others	 said	 it	 was	 like	 nothing	 they’d	 ever	 seen before.	A	designer	virus	or	even	a	new	kind	of	terrorist	attack?	In	truth,	no	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew.	There	was	no	vaccine,	no	cure.	Things	happened	so	fast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	 and	 Tommy	 reached	 the	 body	 on	 the	 shingle	 beach.	 The	 man	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">probably	in	his	thirties,	lying	awkwardly,	his	leg	at	an	unnatural	angle.	But	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 most	 disturbing	 was	 his	 face.	 His	 lower	 jaw	 hung	 loose,	 one	 side	 blown away.	The	back	of	his	head	was	a	mess	where	the	bullet	had	exited.	The	whites</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	his	eyes	were	yellow	and	flecked	with	blood,	like	someone	who	hadn’t	slept</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	days,	staring	lifelessly	skywards.	The	sickness	was	etched	into	his	face.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">typical	grey	pallor,	sunken	eye	sockets,	and	evidence	of	dried	blood	in	his	nose</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	ears.	Considering	the	trauma	to	the	head,	there	was	surprisingly	little	blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	get	the	head	end,”	said	Tommy,	barging	his	friend	out	the	way.	“Ready</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	three.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	wore	garden	gloves,	avoiding	direct	contact.	The	body	was	skeletal	thin</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet	 surprisingly	 heavy.	 As	 the	 trolley	 bumped	 and	 bounced	 along	 the	 roadway, the	 man’s	 leg	 slid	 over	 the	 side.	 The	 material	 rode	 up,	 exposing	 two	 inches	 of skin,	blotched	and	covered	in	sores. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 dumped	 the	 body	 next	 to	 a	 pit	 some	 thirty	 feet	 across	 and	 ten	 deep. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>They	rolled	the	man	over	the	edge,	sliding	down	to	join	the	other	human	shapes at	 the	 bottom.	 Tommy	 grabbed	 a	 jerrycan	 and	 poured	 kerosene,	 dowsing	 the bodies,	splashing	indiscriminately.	He	struck	a	small	flare	and	threw	it	down	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 funeral	 pyre.	 They	 both	 stood	 there	 impassively	 watching	 the	 blaze, enjoying	the	warmth	on	their	legs	and	bare	arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Four</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	strode	back	through	the	main	castle	gate	next	to	the	guardhouse.	He	stepped</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	 the	 narrow-gauge	 rail	 tracks	 and	 crossed	 a	 weathered	 patch	 of	 grass.	 The tracks	 had	 been	 laid	 in	 Napoleonic	 times	 to	 deliver	 stores	 to	 the	 castle	 from	 a military	 dock	 and	 landing	 area,	 long	 since	 dismantled.	 He	 continued	 to	 the	 old white	lighthouse,	set	apart	from	the	eastern	end	of	the	castle	fortifications. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lighthouse	was	modest	but	comfortable.	There	he	lived	a	simple,	almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">monastic	existence	that	imitated	his	former	life	aboard	merchant	ships.	After	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hustle	 and	 bustle	 of	 the	 castle	 camp,	 the	 silence	 and	 solitude	 were	 a	 welcome relief.	Many	of	the	rooms	were	unfurnished,	filled	with	salvaged	equipment	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">gardening	tools.	The	views	across	the	Solent	stretched	uninterrupted	in	multiple</p>
<p class="calibre1">directions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 paused	 at	 the	 doorway,	 a	 puzzled	 expression	 etched	 on	 his	 face.	 He noticed	 the	 tide	 slowly	 rising	 to	 cover	 the	 salt	 marshes	 and	 sheltered	 estuary towards	 Keyhaven	 and	 Lymington	 beyond.	 Something	 about	 the	 smell	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">place	reminded	him	of	a	former	life.	He	had	served	in	the	Royal	Fleet	Auxiliary</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	twenty-five	years,	before	using	his	pension	to	buy	his	very	own	fishing	boat, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 modest	 vessel	 had	 become	 his	 pride	 and	 joy,	 not	 to	 mention	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">livelihood.	 He	 had	 skippered	 the	 boat	 for	 the	 last	 few	 years,	 sometimes	 on	 his own,	but	mostly	with	a	deckhand.	He	knew	these	waters	well.	Every	rock,	every</p>
<p class="calibre1">tidal	 eddy.	 The	 narrow	 western	 entrance	 to	 the	 Solent	 was	 notorious	 for	 its strong	tides.	The	Needles	rocks	at	the	tip	of	the	Isle	of	Wight	were	a	graveyard</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	dozens	of	sailing	ships	and	steamers	in	days	gone	by.	Some	of	those	ships	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">paid	the	ultimate	price. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 the	 skipper	 of	 a	 small	 fishing	 boat,	 Jack	 had	 a	 profound	 respect	 for	 the sea.	 A	 capricious	 playground	 for	 yachtsmen	 but	 a	 series	 of	 calculated	 risks	 for fishermen	like	him	who	plied	their	trade	hauling	lobster	pots	in	all	weathers,	day</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 night.	 There	 had	 been	 a	 small	 but	 established	 community	 of	 fisherman	 in Keyhaven,	and	Lymington	five	miles	beyond.	Jack	was	well	liked	and	respected</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 knew	 most	 of	 the	 others.	 They	 were	 territorial,	 drank	 in	 different	 pubs, fished	their	own	particular	sites.	Each	meticulously	mapped	by	GPS	above	water</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	by	depth	sounder	below. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>The	 unexpected	 sight	 of	 a	 sail	 rounding	 the	 headland	 to	 the	 east	 interrupted Jack’s	 reminiscences.	 It	 was	 a	 small	 sailing	 boat.	 He	 estimated	 it	 was	 no	 more than	thirty	feet	in	length.	He	slid	his	wire-framed	glasses	up	on	to	his	forehead</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	peered	through	the	binoculars.	On	board	and	hailing	him	with	a	slow	wave</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 a	 man	 he	 didn’t	 recognise.	 There	 was	 a	 small	 child	 beside	 him,	 wearing	 a yellow	oilskin	jacket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	made	a	mental	note	to	reprimand	whoever	was	on	lookout	this	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	had	been	no	warning	of	the	stranger’s	approach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 on	 the	 boat	 looked	 back	 at	 Jack	 through	 his	 own	 binoculars	 and raised	 his	 hand	 again	 to	 wave.	 He	 cupped	 his	 hands,	 shouting	 as	 loud	 as	 he could.	 Jack	 wasn’t	 sure	 he	 heard	 what	 was	 said	 but	 waved	 back,	 more	 through habit	 than	 genuine	 welcome.	 He	 did	 not	 approach	 the	 quay	 to	 help,	 keeping	 a safe	distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 the	 sailor	 had	 finished	 mooring	 up,	 attaching	 lines	 fore	 and	 aft,	 he cupped	his	hands	again	and	called	out	in	an	educated	voice,	enunciating	clearly</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	if	Jack	might	not	speak	English:	“May	we	come	ashore?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stay	where	you	are,”	cautioned	Jack,	gesturing	him	to	stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please.	 We’re	 not	 sick.	 Can	 you	 at	 least	 spare	 us	 some	 food	 and	 water? </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’re	willing	to	trade.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 can	 moor	 up	 and	 shelter	 for	 the	 night	 and	 then	 be	 on	 your	 way.	 We might	be	able	to	spare	you	some	water	and	bread,	but	we’ve	precious	little	else.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	don’t	have	much	food,	but	we	have	some	flares	and	a	first	aid	kit.	Look, </p>
<p class="calibre1">we’re	both	healthy.	We’ve	not	been	in	contact	with	anyone	for	days.	In	fact,	it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">nice	 to	 have	 a	 conversation	 with	 someone	 for	 a	 change.	 Please,	 I’m	 begging you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sorry.	It’s	too	risky	to	let	you	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	an	uneasy	silence	as	the	man	on	the	boat	stroked	his	son’s	hair	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">whispered	something	in	his	ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	your	names?”	offered	Jack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	Simon,	and	this	is	Toby.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	have	you	sailed	from?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Weymouth.	We	left	yesterday,	borrowed	this	boat,	grabbed	what	we	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	no	great	sailor,	but	we	got	this	far.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 stood	 impassively	 still,	 his	 arms	 crossed.	 Simon	 shifted	 uneasily, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wracking	his	brains	for	another	way	to	convince	Jack	to	take	them	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please,	 just	 give	 us	 a	 chance.	 We’re	 hard	 workers.	 We’ll	 do	 whatever	 it takes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	looked	him	up	and	down	and	tried	to	guess	what	Simon	had	been	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	outbreak.	He	wore	an	open-necked	striped	shirt	frayed	at	the	collar	and	red</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>trousers	 that	 bulged	 slightly	 at	 the	 waist.	 His	 Nike	 running	 shoes	 were	 heavily worn.	 Jack’s	 guess	 was	 a	 City	 worker,	 maybe	 an	 accountant	 or	 solicitor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	who	had	never	done	a	real	day’s	work	in	his	life.	Never	felt	the	sun	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 back	 as	 he	 toiled.	 He	 embodied	 everything	 that	 Jack	 despised:	 blood, privilege	and	money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 don’t	 have	 much	 use	 for	 lawyers	 and	 accountants	 round	 here,”	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">taunted	playfully.	“This	is	a	working	community.	What	skills	do	you	have?	Any</p>
<p class="calibre1">trades?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon	 blushed,	 pushing	 his	 glasses	 up	 his	 nose,	 alert	 to	 the	 edge	 in	 Jack’s questions.	“Funnily	enough,	I	was	a	solicitor.	I	ran	my	own	practice.”	He	smiled</p>
<p class="calibre1">defensively.	“But…but…”	He	looked	like	he	was	searching	for	something,	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">erupted	enthusiastically,	“I	know	first	aid.	I	used	to	grow	my	own	vegetables…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	voice	tailed	off,	trying	hard	to	think	of	something	else	he	could	claim	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	at. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	got	a	doctor	already.	Can	you	cook?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	 not	 bad.	 My	 mother	 was	 Italian,”	 he	 said,	 nodding	 confidently.	 “I make	 a	 mean	 spaghetti	 bolognese,	 if	 you	 can	 find	 me	 the	 ingredients,	 that	 is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fresh	 herbs,	 tomatoes,	 oregano,	 mother’s	 secret	 recipe.	 I	 could	 tell	 you	 but	 I’d have	 to	 kill	 you,”	 he	 snorted.	 “I	 see	 you	 have	 a	 greenhouse	 back	 there,	 so	 you must	have	quite	the	set-up	here.	Surely	you	have	room	for	a	couple	more?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Simon,	 I’ll	 level	 with	 you.	 We’ve	 got	 a	 lot	 of	 mouths	 to	 feed	 already,	 and we’re	 just	 barely	 getting	 by	 as	 it	 is.	 But	 if	 you’re	 not	 afraid	 of	 hard	 work,	 can pull	your	own	weight	around	the	place,	and	do	your	bit,	then	maybe?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	look	of	desperation	about	the	pair	of	them	that	Jack	had	seen	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">many	times	before.	The	boy	looked	close	to	tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,	please,”	continued	Simon.	“We’ll	do	anything.	Just	give	us	a	chance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	hard	out	there,	just	the	two	of	us.	The	boy	needs	a	proper	home,	kids	his	own</p>
<p class="calibre1">age.	You	have	other	children,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	children,	yes.	Lots	of	children,”	said	Jack	with	a	sigh,	remembering</p>
<p class="calibre1">why	he	enjoyed	the	solitude	of	the	lighthouse.	“How	were	things	in	Weymouth? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Are	there	many	survivors?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon	 stared	 at	 the	 ground,	 lost	 in	 thought	 for	 a	 second,	 his	 voice	 softer:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	many.	We	got	hit	bad,	no	warning.	I	lost	my	wife	and	daughter	early	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">outbreak.	Me	and	Toby	didn’t	get	sick.	We	moved	around	a	fair	bit,	from	house</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 house,	 living	 off	 whatever	 we	 could	 find.	 It	 was	 hard,	 but	 we	 survived.	 We had	 some	 close	 shaves.	 Things	 got	 crazy.	 Gangs	 rampaging,	 looking	 for	 food. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 hid	 during	 the	 day	 and	 moved	 around	 at	 night.	 We	 got	 caught	 a	 couple	 of times,	had	all	our	food	stolen.	One	time,	they	left	us	for	dead—”	He	broke	off, </p>
<p class="calibre1">remembering	 the	 horror.	 “I	 don’t	 want	 to	 live	 out	 there,	 not	 any	 more.	 I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>begging	you…please.	Just	give	us	a	chance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen,	I’ll	speak	to	the	others,	okay?	That’s	the	best	I	can	do.	No	promises. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stay	here.	Consider	yourself	in	quarantine.	If	you’re	both	fit	and	healthy	with	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">sign	 of	 infection	 in	 forty-eight	 hours,	 then	 we’ll	 talk.	 In	 the	 meantime,	 keep yourselves	to	yourselves.	Don’t	go	wandering	around.	If	you	approach	the	main</p>
<p class="calibre1">gate,	you	will	be	shot.	Am	I	clear?	If	you	need	anything,	shout.	My	name’s	Jack, </p>
<p class="calibre1">everyone	knows	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nice	to	meet	you,	Jack.	And	thank	you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	turned	on	his	heels,	shaking	his	head.	He	was	getting	soft	in	his	old	age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	what	they	needed.	More	mouths	to	feed.	More	blooming	kids.	He	smiled	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself	and	walked	back	to	the	lighthouse. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Five</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	finished	getting	dressed	and	grabbed	a	rucksack	from	behind	the	front	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 wandered	 back	 the	 short	 distance	 that	 separated	 the	 lighthouse	 from	 the castle	walls	through	the	main	gate	to	the	canteen	to	join	Terra	and	a	small	group</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	others	who	were	still	finishing	their	breakfast.	The	smell	of	coffee	and	fresh</p>
<p class="calibre1">bread	lingered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terra	poured	him	some	coffee	from	a	large	catering	kettle,	burning	her	hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 metal	 handle.	 She	 sucked	 at	 her	 fingers,	 wincing	 as	 the	 pain	 subsided. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	studied	her	with	a	glint	in	his	eye.	There	was	something	different	about	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">today,	though	he	couldn’t	put	his	finger	on	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	an	attractive	woman,	almost	two	decades	his	junior,	but	old	beyond</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	years.	This	morning	she	had	made	little	effort	with	her	appearance.	She	wore</p>
<p class="calibre1">loose-fitting	 clothes	 fit	 for	 a	 day’s	 work.	 Her	 shoulder-length	 auburn	 hair	 was tied	 back	 under	 a	 headscarf.	 Jack	 lifted	 the	 cup	 to	 his	 lips	 and	 blew	 away	 the steam,	still	too	hot	to	drink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s	meant	to	be	on	lookout	duty	this	morning?	A	yacht’s	just	arrived.	No</p>
<p class="calibre1">warning.	They	just	crept	in	without	anyone	noticing,”	said	Jack	flatly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	others	stopped	what	they	were	doing	and	leaned	in	excitedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?	 How	 many	 are	 they?	 Where	 did	 they	 come	 from?	 What	 did	 they</p>
<p class="calibre1">say?”	 asked	 Terra,	 curious	 to	 hear	 about	 the	 world	 outside	 and	 whether	 Jack would	let	them	stay.	At	times	it	felt	so	claustrophobic	here.	So	little	was	known</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	 what	 was	 going	 on	 beyond	 the	 castle	 walls.	 When	 the	 broadcasts	 had ceased	all	those	months	ago,	the	world	got	smaller	quickly.	They	relied	on	word</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	mouth,	rumours,	and	stories	from	other	survivor	groups. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 told	 them	 what	 little	 he	 knew	 and	 cautioned	 them	 against	 approaching the	boat	until	the	new	arrivals	had	passed	quarantine.	They	would	need	to	decide</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether	 to	 accept	 Simon	 and	 Toby,	 but	 in	 the	 circumstances,	 he	 could	 hardly turn	them	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 had	 already	 taken	 in	 five	 more	 the	 previous	 week,	 swelling	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">numbers	 to	 breaking	 point.	 But	 with	 two	 team	 members	 gone	 this	 last	 month, one	 from	 a	 suspected	 tumour,	 the	 other	 missing,	 captured	 or	 killed	 by	 a	 rival group,	they	needed	to	maintain	their	strength.	They	needed	a	full	complement	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">working	men	and	women. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>According	 to	 Jack’s	 roster,	 all	 told,	 there	 were	 sixty-two	 able-bodied	 adults living	 at	 Hurst	 Castle,	 himself	 included;	 thirty-seven	 men	 and	 twenty-five women.	 Then	 there	 were	 three	 unable	 to	 work	 through	 injury	 or	 old	 age,	 and twelve	children,	the	youngest	being	five	years	old. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 considered	 himself	 a	 good	 judge	 of	 character.	 He	 believed	 everyone</p>
<p class="calibre1">deserved	 a	 chance.	 In	 his	 experience,	 giving	 people	 a	 little	 responsibility	 at	 an early	age	transformed	them.	Tommy	was	something	of	a	protégé	to	him.	He	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	making	of	a	leader,	a	good	heart,	knew	what	made	people	tick.	Two	ears,	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">mouth,	 and	 he	 used	 them	 in	 the	 right	 proportions.	 With	 the	 right	 direction,	 he showed	 promise.	 Tommy	 was	 from	 the	 school	 of	 hard	 knocks.	 Had	 grown	 up</p>
<p class="calibre1">quickly	when	his	dad	died.	Jack	had	a	long	history	of	similar	nurturing	projects</p>
<p class="calibre1">during	 his	 time	 in	 the	 service.	 He	 believed	 even	 the	 bad	 apples,	 the	 most delinquent	 and	 wayward	 individuals,	 could	 be	 brought	 back	 to	 the	 straight	 and narrow.	There	was	good	in	everyone,	you	just	had	to	find	it	and	cultivate	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	military	background,	management	skills	and	grey	hairs	had	made	Jack	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">obvious	 candidate	 for	 leader.	 Sure,	 there	 had	 been	 others,	 wannabes	 making	 a grab	for	power	and	position.	They	had	spoken	with	passion	and	conviction	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 plans,	 their	 hopes	 for	 the	 future.	 But	 in	 the	 end,	 Jack’s	 pragmatism	 and composure,	 not	 to	 mention	 his	 strong	 belief	 in	 pastoral	 care,	 won	 the	 vote.	 He had	been	one	of	the	first	to	arrive	at	Hurst	and	the	group	had	never	forgotten	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">warmth	 of	 his	 welcome.	 He	 had	 provided	 sanctuary	 for	 them	 in	 their	 hour	 of need. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	sickness	had	first	appeared,	Jack	calmly	packed	his	old	grey	Land</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rover	with	tools,	food,	a	shotgun	and	his	fishing	gear	as	if	he	was	going	to	sea</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	 <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>,	but	this	time	headed	straight	to	Hurst. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 years	 of	 cruising	 past	 the	 castle	 on	 his	 way	 out	 to	 sea	 to	 pick	 up	 his lobster	 pots,	 he	 had	 always	 admired	 the	 impressive	 fortifications.	 He	 made	 a mental	note	that	should	the	world	end	any	time	soon,	there	were	worse	places	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">hole	up	and	wait	things	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hurst	 had	 much	 to	 recommend	 it.	 It	 had	 its	 own	 generator,	 was	 only</p>
<p class="calibre1">reachable	 by	 boat	 or	 by	 four-wheel	 drive	 vehicles	 along	 a	 mile	 and	 a	 half	 of shingle	 spit.	 It	 could	 sustain	 a	 large	 group	 of	 people	 in	 relative	 comfort.	 The thirty-feet-high	 walls	 would	 keep	 out	 any	 undesirables	 and	 with	 a	 bit	 of	 luck, they	could	rebuild	again	from	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	first	few	weeks,	Jack	had	welcomed	successive	survivor	groups	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	local	area.	He	had	established	a	quarantine	zone	in	the	inner	courtyard	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">new	 arrivals	 could	 wait	 the	 forty-eight	 hours	 to	 show	 they	 were	 clear	 of infection.	He	provided	them	with	shelter,	warmth	and	what	little	food	they	had	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 early	 days.	 Hurst	 Castle	 had	 quickly	 become	 a	 sanctuary	 from	 the	 chaos</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	wasn’t	everybody’s	first	choice	for	leader.	He	was	fond	of	rules,	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">others	 disagreed	 with	 or	 saw	 as	 petty	 and	 unnecessary.	 He	 insisted	 that	 all weapons	 be	 surrendered	 at	 the	 gate	 and	 put	 in	 the	 castle	 armoury	 for	 safe storage.	 All	 food	 was	 placed	 in	 the	 dry	 storerooms	 beneath	 the	 castle	 walls, where	 shells	 and	 ammunition	 had	 once	 been	 housed.	 Food	 was	 rationed	 out</p>
<p class="calibre1">equally.	 Everybody	 worked	 their	 fair	 share.	 Everyone	 had	 a	 role	 to	 play, including	all	but	the	youngest	children.	No	freeloaders,	no	passengers.	It	wasn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">much,	 but	 people	 respected	 Jack	 and	 rewarded	 his	 trust	 with	 their	 loyalty	 and hard	work.	As	a	result,	the	community	had	grown,	swelling	to	a	size	where	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">resources	were	stretched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	made	Terra	his	second	in	command.	Together	with	an	inner	circle	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">advisers	 and	 lieutenants,	 subdividing	 responsibility	 for	 food,	 accommodation, and	animal	welfare	for	their	small	herd	of	cows,	pigs	and	sheep.	If	Jack	was	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">patriarch,	then	Terra	was	Hurst’s	unofficial	matriarch.	She	was	a	capable	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 had	 been	 reticent	 about	 sharing	 too	 much	 about	 her	 story	 when	 she	 first arrived.	 Everyone	 assumed	 it	 was	 too	 difficult	 for	 her	 to	 talk	 about,	 some personal	tragedy.	They	had	all	suffered	in	some	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terra	 had	 confided	 in	 Jack	 that	 she	 revelled	 in	 her	 anonymity	 here.	 A	 clean break	from	the	mistakes	of	her	past.	Her	slate	wiped	clean.	She	could	be	anyone</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 wanted	 to	 be.	 The	 new	 Terra	 she	 chose	 for	 herself	 was	 authoritative	 yet likeable,	confident	and	sassy,	accessible	yet	complex.	For	the	first	time	in	a	long while,	she	looked	in	the	mirror	and	said	she	liked	who	she	saw.	She	had	adopted</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	name	Terra.	She	said	it	sounded	earthy	and	fearful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	whole	place	ran	like	clockwork,	thanks	to	Terra.	She	cared	for	the	sick, </p>
<p class="calibre1">helped	run	the	kitchen	canteen,	looked	after	the	kids	and	kept	things	organised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	hit	it	off	early	with	Jack	and	they	had	a	close	friendship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 goldfish	 bowl	 that	 was	 life	 at	 Hurst,	 people	 whispered.	 The	 pair’s mannerisms	 and	 body	 language	 were	 scrutinised	 intensely.	 When	 they</p>
<p class="calibre1">exchanged	 stolen	 glances,	 or	 sat	 together,	 talking	 conspiratorially	 in	 hushed tones,	most	likely	about	planning	and	operations,	people	noticed	and	winked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	chose	Zed	to	be	in	charge	of	defence.	What	Zed	lacked	in	discipline,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	up	for	in	survival	skills	and	what	Jack	called	“bush	craft”.	Though	he	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">never	admitted	as	much,	Jack	suspected	Zed	had	spent	time	in	the	military. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hurst	 Castle	 had	 provided	 a	 rich	 cache	 of	 weaponry	 from	 its	 museum</p>
<p class="calibre1">displays	covering	five	 hundred	years	of	 history.	From	ornate	 swords,	axes,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">maces	through	to	whole	suits	of	armour	dating	back	to	Tudor	times	when	Henry</p>
<p class="calibre1">VIII	 had	 the	 castle	 built.	 The	 museum	 also	 had	 an	 impressive	 collection	 of World	War	II	weaponry,	including	Sten	guns,	Bren	guns,	rifles	and	pistols.	Most</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>of	them	were	useless	without	their	firing	mechanisms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 scavenging	 parties	 that	 Zed	 led	 in	 search	 of	 food	 and	 supplies	 made	 a curious	 spectacle.	 A	 motley	 crew	 standing	 ready	 for	 inspection	 before	 they headed	 out,	 carried	 a	 smorgasbord	 of	 knuckledusters,	 helmets,	 firearms	 and swords.	Zed	had	kept	the	best	for	himself:	a	double-headed	axe,	sharpened	daily, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that	split	logs	with	a	single	blow.	On	trips	to	the	forest	tracking	deer	and	rabbits, gathering	mushrooms	and	berries,	he	liked	to	keep	the	axe	strapped	between	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulder	blades,	like	a	hunter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	and	Jack	had	fallen	out	publicly	over	the	smallest	of	things,	from	castle</p>
<p class="calibre1">rules	 to	 food	 rationing.	 Zed	 held	 that	 the	 guys	 who	 took	 the	 risks	 deserved	 the lion’s	share	of	the	rewards.	Terra	had	never	trusted	Zed.	She	made	sure	that	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	her	own	people	kept	an	eye	on	him	and	reported	back.	Zed	was	the	source	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">many	 of	 their	 discussions.	 In	 the	 end	 Jack	 argued	 that	 Zed’s	 good	 deeds outweighed	the	bad.	They	both	knew	that	a	time	would	come	when	Zed's	loyalty</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	be	tested,	and	she	knew	he	would	put	his	own	interests	before	those	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">community. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Six</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	loaded	the	last	of	the	gear	into	the	Land	Rover	and	wandered	back	to	join</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	group	of	seven.	Lucky	seven,	Zed	thought	to	himself.	Two	teams,	two	cars, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	way	they	had	done	things	for	weeks.	He	unfolded	the	ordinance	survey	map</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 rechecked	 today’s	 search	 area	 marked	 with	 large	 red	 and	 black	 felt-tip crosses	 and	 blocks,	 showing	 where	 teams	 had	 already	 searched.	 Red	 circles highlighted	 supermarkets,	 hardware	 stores,	 pharmacies	 or	 other	 areas	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">potential	 interest.	 Most	 of	 the	 obvious	 places	 had	 been	 looted	 some	 time	 ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black	 circles	 with	 skull	 and	 crossbones	 were	 areas	 to	 be	 avoided,	 where	 rival groups	had	set	up	camp	or	where	pockets	of	infection	remained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	relaxed	air	of	normality	about	their	conversation	this	morning,	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 huddled	 together,	 smoking	 and	 laughing.	 Bob,	 Riley	 and	 Joe	 had	 made these	trips	dozens	of	times.	To	them	it	was	routine,	but	it	remained	Zed’s	job	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">prepare	them	properly	for	each	and	every	trip	and	remind	them	of	the	very	real</p>
<p class="calibre1">dangers	ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each	three-man	team	carried	water,	food,	torches,	rope,	and	a	handheld	radio</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	a	range	of	about	two	kilometres.	The	seventh	team	member	stayed	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">vehicles	while	the	two	teams	conducted	house-to-house	searches	or	systemically</p>
<p class="calibre1">swept	 larger	 stores.	 If	 one	 of	 the	 teams	 got	 into	 trouble	 they	 could	 radio	 the others	 for	 support.	 Every	 team	 member	 carried	 a	 weapon.	 Several	 of	 them	 had both	blade	and	firearm,	chosen	from	the	armoury. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	had	trained	them	well.	Riley,	in	particular,	knew	how	to	handle	herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	watched	her	tie	back	her	long	brown	hair	in	a	ponytail,	sharing	a	joke	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bob.	 She	 wore	 a	 grey	 Puffa	 jacket,	 jeans	 and	 ankle-high	 walking	 boots.	 Once she’d	rechecked	her	rucksack,	she	inserted	a	long-handled	machete	in	the	sheath</p>
<p class="calibre1">attached	to	the	front	of	her	webbing	and	jumped	up	and	down	a	couple	of	times</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	check	for	any	rattles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	rest	of	today’s	team	was	made	up	of	three	recent	arrivals,	whose	turn	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 on	 the	 camp	 rota	 system.	 Will	 was	 a	 jovial	 thirty-something	 builder, originally	from	South	Africa.	He	was	a	bear	of	a	man	with	a	luxurious	beard.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	 in	 good	 shape,	 despite	 months	 of	 living	 out	 there,	 before	 coming	 to Hurst.	The	other	two	were	younger,	probably	in	their	late	teens.	Mila	and	Sean</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 arrived	 together.	 They	 were	 bold	 as	 brass,	 cocksure	 in	 their	 youthful</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>arrogance,	 but	 underneath	 the	 bravado,	 Zed	 could	 tell	 they	 were	 bricking	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	did	on	their	first	trip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 did	 his	 best	 to	 settle	 their	 nerves,	 brief	 them	 and	 assign	 them	 roles, teaming	 them	 up	 with	 the	 more	 experienced	 guys.	 Zed	 would	 drive	 Mila	 and Sean	in	the	Land	Rover.	Will	would	stick	with	Bob	and	Riley	in	the	Mitsubishi</p>
<p class="calibre1">Land	Cruiser	with	Joe	as	their	driver	and	seventh	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 the	 two-car	 convoy	 rounded	 the	 wall	 and	 headed	 out	 west,	 a	 silhouetted figure	on	the	battlements	waved	them	off	with	a	mock	salute	and	a	smile	to	Zed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which	he	acknowledged	with	minimal	effort	by	raising	a	single	index	finger	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	steering	wheel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 bumping	 along	 the	 spit	 at	 a	 steady	 crawl	 they	 joined	 the	 coastal	 road that	 ran	 along	 the	 seafront	 at	 Milford.	 They	 turned	 on	 to	 the	 main	 road	 out towards	 Lymington,	 passing	 dozens	 of	 abandoned	 cars.	 Many	 had	 their	 doors open,	some	burned-out,	others	with	bodies	still	visible	inside.	They	had	cleared</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 road	 some	 time	 ago	 and	 pushed	 the	 cars	 on	 to	 the	 grass	 verges	 and pavements.	 In	 places,	 the	 convoy	 had	 to	 slow	 to	 walking	 pace	 to	 navigate	 the resulting	obstacles	and	rusting	metal	chicanes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today	their	search	area	was	a	row	of	houses	on	Lymington	high	street,	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">five	or	six	kilometres	away.	They	would	be	outside	of	radio	contact	with	home</p>
<p class="calibre1">base.	That	meant	that	they	were	on	their	own	if	things	went	“turbo”,	as	Joe	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">fond	 of	 saying.	 That	 didn’t	 worry	 Zed.	 They	 had	 made	 these	 trips	 dozens	 of times,	in	and	out,	with	few	complications. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Coming	 along	 the	 main	 road	 through	 a	 fire-damaged	 Pennington	 and	 into</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lymington	town	centre,	they	passed	a	supermarket,	swept	clean	in	the	first	few</p>
<p class="calibre1">days	of	the	outbreak.	Nothing	now	remained,	except	shopping	trolleys,	smashed</p>
<p class="calibre1">together	at	one	end	of	the	car	park	by	the	recent	storms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“People	 would	 have	 paid	 good	 money	 for	 that	 back	 in	 the	 day,”	 joked	 Joe, pointing	at	the	twisted	pile	of	rusting	metal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	 Deserves	 to	 be	 in	 the	 Tate	 Modern.	 ‘Shopping	 trolley	 sculpture’	 by Damien	Hirst.	Price	tag	two	million	pounds,”	added	Sean,	with	no	small	degree</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	sarcasm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	all	laughed,	despite	their	nerves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never	again.	Those	times	are	gone,”	said	Zed.	“Good	riddance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	only	thing	money	is	good	for	is	burning,”	said	Sean,	laconically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right	on,	brother.	Citizen	Sean	here	has	spoken,”	mocked	Joe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Along	the	high	street	they	inched	forward,	watching	for	movement	on	either</p>
<p class="calibre1">side.	The	car	in	front	pulled	up	in	a	side	street	so	they	could	start	their	search	on foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	an	eerie	quiet	at	street	level.	A	lone	seagull	soared	on	the	breeze, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>scanning	 for	 scraps.	 A	 cardboard	 box	 skated	 along	 the	 pavement.	 Newspaper rustled,	caught	on	the	railings	of	the	local	bank,	its	ATM	screen	dark	and	lifeless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 widespread	 evidence	 of	 a	 rapid	 exodus.	 Unchecked	 looting, </p>
<p class="calibre1">storefronts	 smashed	 in,	 doors	 kicked	 down.	 Loss	 of	 power	 had	 silenced	 the alarms	 and	 blinded	 CCTV	 systems.	 Some	 storekeepers	 and	 homeowners	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">stayed	behind	to	protect	their	property,	shouting	impotently	at	the	looters	to	keep back.	 The	 police	 never	 came.	 Those	 that	 stayed	 behind	 in	 the	 towns	 had	 most likely	died.	Only	those	that	got	out	survived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed’s	team	operated	 in	silence.	Hand	 signals	were	passed	 between	the	 team</p>
<p class="calibre1">members	 as	 they	 crept	 along	 separate	 sides	 of	 the	 street.	 They	 stopped	 several times	 to	 listen	 and	 observe.	 There	 was	 no	 one	 around.	 Halfway	 along,	 they reached	a	large	town	house	with	a	front	window	smashed	in,	its	front	door	intact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	crowbarred	the	top	and	bottom	hinges.	After	some	brute	force	and	grunting</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 levered	 open	 the	 lock.	 Zed	 gestured	 to	 Sean	 to	 take	 the	 left	 and	 Mila	 the right	as	they	stepped	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 hall	 and	 staircase	 were	 deserted,	 untouched	 by	 the	 chaos	 outside.	 The living	room	to	the	left	was	filled	with	bookshelves,	two	large	brown	leather	sofas</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 an	 armchair.	 Family	 photos	 of	 holidays	 and	 Christmases	 spoke	 of	 happier times.	 Sean	 picked	 up	 a	 framed	 photo	 and	 smiled	 at	 the	 laughing	 faces	 of children	playing	on	a	beach.	The	shelf	had	a	heavy	layer	of	dust.	He	replaced	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">silver	frame	carefully,	opening	drawers	one	by	one,	looking	for	anything	usable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mila	ran	a	finger	along	the	spines	of	several	of	the	books.	The	castle	library</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	well	stocked,	but	they	were	always	on	the	lookout	to	add	to	the	collection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 grabbed	 a	 couple	 of	 novels	 that	 looked	 unfamiliar	 and	 a	 large	 visual encyclopaedia	 the	 children	 would	 like,	 together	 with	 a	 French	 dictionary.	 She stuffed	them	into	the	large	rucksack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 kitchen,	 the	 cupboards	 were	 mostly	 bare,	 aside	 from	 tinned	 tuna	 and vegetables.	 They	 grabbed	 some	 spices	 and	 wrapped	 the	 sharp	 knives	 from	 the drawer	in	a	tea	towel	to	keep	them	safe	as	they	continued	their	search.	Under	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">stairs	 they	 found	 tools,	 oil,	 glue,	 cleaning	 products	 and	 other	 household	 items that	were	always	in	demand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 noise	 from	 the	 floor	 above	 made	 all	 of	 them	 look	 round.	 Sean	 and	 Mila stared	 anxiously	 at	 Zed,	 who	 gestured	 for	 them	 both	 to	 stay	 calm	 and	 follow him.	He	normally	stuck	to	the	ground	floor,	but	something	told	Zed	that	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">worth	 the	 risk	 to	 continue	 the	 search	 upstairs.	 They	 crept	 silently,	 planting	 one foot	in	front	of	the	other,	carefully,	step	by	step.	They	kept	their	eyes	focused	on the	 landing	 above	 through	 the	 banisters.	 Zed’s	 revolver	 was	 drawn,	 though	 he only	 had	 two	 bullets	 loaded.	 A	 large	 creak	 betrayed	 them	 and	 they	 froze	 for	 a few	seconds	to	listen. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>At	 the	 top	 of	 the	 stairs,	 outside	 the	 first	 door,	 Zed	 signalled	 to	 the	 others, counting	down	to	zero	from	three.	They	barged	through,	splintering	the	lock	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">swept	the	room,	pointing	their	weapons	into	each	corner.	There	was	nothing.	Just</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	large	bed	and	two	wardrobes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 tried	 the	 next	 bedroom.	 A	 child’s	 room	 with	 movie	 posters	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Transformers</i>	and	 <i class="calibre4">James	 Bond</i>.	 There	 was	 a	 PC	 monitor,	 keyboard	 and	 desk,	 a Manchester	United	duvet	cover	and	matching	pillowcase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 readied	 themselves	 outside	 the	 last	 bedroom,	 nodding	 to	 each	 other, </p>
<p class="calibre1">weapons	ready.	Zed	 kicked	open	the	 door	and	charged	 inside,	closely	followed</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	the	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 stench	 was	 overpowering.	 Mila	 recoiled,	 covering	 her	 nose	 and	 mouth</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 her	 sleeve.	 Lying	 on	 the	 bed	 was	 a	 family	 of	 three,	 the	 mother	 and	 child locked	 in	 a	 final	 embrace.	 Their	 skin	 pale	 and	 drawn	 tight	 across	 their	 faces, mouths	open	in	a	silent	cry	of	anguish,	their	eyes	blank,	staring	at	each	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sean	approached	the	bed	and	peered	over	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Poor	bastards,”	he	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 the	 sound	 of	 his	 voice,	 the	 father’s	 mouth	 opened	 and	 let	 out	 a	 pained groan.	Sean	jumped	back	startled,	his	knife	drawn.	“Holy	crap!	That	scared	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bejesus	out	of	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	barged	Sean	out	the	way,	covering	the	bed	with	his	weapon,	keeping	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 won’t	 hurt	 you.	 He’s	 barely	 alive.	 The	 other	 two	 are	 long	 gone,”	 said Zed,	dispassionately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shouldn’t	 we	 put	 him	 out	 of	 his	 misery,”	 suggested	 Sean,	 recovering	 his sangfroid,	but	still	visibly	trembling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	 point,”	 countered	 Zed.	 “Leave	 him	 be.	 Check	 the	 bathroom	 and	 study</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	then	let’s	get	out	of	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 regrouped	 downstairs,	 their	 rucksacks	 half-filled	 with	 an	 eclectic</p>
<p class="calibre1">selection	of	batteries,	books,	food	and	tools.	They	moved	on	to	the	next	house, </p>
<p class="calibre1">this	 time	 empty.	 The	 occupants	 had	 left	 a	 chaotic	 trail	 of	 clothes	 and	 personal items	discarded	on	the	stairs	and	in	the	hall	in	their	hurry	to	get	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Above	the	mantelpiece	Sean	spotted	a	ceremonial	sword,	perhaps	an	antique</p>
<p class="calibre1">relic	 of	 a	 military	 career.	 He	 turned	 it	 over	 in	 his	 hands,	 testing	 the	 weight.	 It might	make	a	useful	weapon	if	sharpened	up	a	little,	its	edges	dull,	never	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">used	 in	 anger.	 He	 grabbed	 a	 stack	 of	 CDs	 for	 their	 sound	 system	 back	 at	 the camp.	On	special	occasions,	Jack	would	let	them	power	up	the	generator,	drink</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	of	Liz’s	home	brew	and	toast	departed	friends.	Then	there	was	the	thorny</p>
<p class="calibre1">issue	 of	 Jack’s	 limited	 CD	 collection,	 consisting	 mostly	 of	 Led	 Zeppelin	 and Pink	Floyd.	Anything	new	or	modern	would	be	cheered	by	one	and	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>Their	rucksacks	virtually	full,	they	were	just	sweeping	the	third	house	when Zed’s	radio	crackled	into	life.	A	loud	beep	signalled	that	one	of	the	other	team</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	trying	to	contact	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Zed,	it’s	Joe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	ahead,	Joe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Four	cars,	repeat	four,	just	drove	into	town	and	are	heading	straight	towards</p>
<p class="calibre1">you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,	Joe.	We’ll	sit	tight	and	wait	this	one	out,”	replied	Zed.	“Bob?	You</p>
<p class="calibre1">there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	mate.	We’re	nearly	done.	Riley	is	upstairs,	Will	is	keeping	watch	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">doorway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	Bob,	let’s	keep	our	heads	down	and	wait	for	this	lot	to	pass	through.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roger	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 and	 his	 team	 had	 learned	 the	 hard	 way	 that	 tangling	 with	 rival	 groups was	best	avoided.	Live	and	let	live.	Fighting	was	a	last	resort.	You	tended	to	live longer	that	way.	The	team	would	lay	low	until	the	threat	had	passed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Seven</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	row	of	shops	and	flats	across	the	street,	the	other	team	was	finishing	their sweep.	 They	 had	 a	 decent	 haul	 of	 tinned	 food,	 pasta,	 some	 clothes,	 several bottles	of	spirits	and	cans	of	fizzy	drinks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	 stood	 outside	 the	 house	 scanning	 the	 high	 street	 in	 both	 directions, humming	a	nursery	rhyme	about	a	“springbok	jumping	over	the	moon”	that	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	popped	into	his	head.	Where	had	that	come	from?	He	took	a	long	draw	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 cigarette	 and	 exhaled	 noisily.	 A	 thin	 plume	 of	 smoke	 funnelled	 upwards	 into the	grey	overcast	sky,	as	his	mind	wandered	to	happier	times	growing	up.	He	felt</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	long	way	from	his	family	home	just	outside	Johannesburg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bob	joined	him	on	the	top	step	and	shared	his	cigarette. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	me	again	where	you	were	before	Hurst,”	asked	Bob,	clearing	his	throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	far	from	here	actually.	I	was	holed	up	in	a	new-build	town	house	for	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">while	with	a	couple	of	lads	I	worked	with	on	construction	projects.	When	things</p>
<p class="calibre1">started	 breaking	 down,	 we	 got	 out	 of	 town	 and	 drove	 straight	 to	 this	 old farmhouse	we	knew.	The	property	had	been	empty,	mid-renovation.	The	owners</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 moved	 out	 to	 escape	 the	 dust	 and	 disruption.	 They	 were	 living	 abroad	 in Portugal	or	Spain,	I	can't	remember	which.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bob	 nodded,	 keeping	 watch	 up	 and	 down	 the	 street,	 waiting	 for	 Will	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">continue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	got	by,	picking	fruit	and	vegetables	from	the	garden,	helping	ourselves</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 whatever	 we	 could	 find.	 They	 had	 this	 walk-in	 larder	 there	 with	 dry	 stores. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 one	 of	 the	 others	 got	 sick,	 I	 panicked	 and	 bolted.	 Never	 went	 back.	 I wasn't	 taking	 any	 chances.	 I'd	 seen	 how	 quickly	 the	 sickness	 spread.	 I	 just	 left everything	 behind.	 My	 clothes,	 my	 mates,	 everything	 and	 just	 drove	 until	 I	 hit the	coastal	road.	I	sat	in	the	car	for	an	hour	with	the	engine	running,	staring	out to	 sea.	 For	 the	 first	 time	 since	 I	 immigrated	 to	 England,	 I	 felt	 completely isolated,	divorced	from	everything	I	had	known.	I	realised	that	it	was	up	to	me	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	a	new	life	somewhere	safe,	to	find	other	survivors	and	rebuild.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bob	 took	 another	 drag	 from	 the	 cigarette,	 flicking	 the	 ash	 and	 wheezing</p>
<p class="calibre1">again.	“You	were	like	me.	You	got	lucky,	eh?	How	did	you	find	Hurst?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	spotted	Jack's	headlights	bumping	along	the	shingle	roadway	and	followed</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	out	to	the	castle	after	dark.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>Will	remembered	his	first	impressions	of	the	place.	The	precautions	they	had taken	 with	 him.	 Held	 at	 gunpoint,	 quarantined	 until	 proven	 fit	 and	 healthy, treated	with	suspicion,	questioned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	guys	were	different	from	the	other	groups	I’d	encountered.	You	took	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">chances.	I	was	a	potential	threat	to	your	way	of	life.	I	respected	that.	Like	the	old days	back	home	in	South	Africa.	Living	in	fear	of	carjacking	and	armed	robbery, </p>
<p class="calibre1">HIV	 and	 infection,	 snakes	 and	 spiders,	 crocs	 and	 hippos.	 Being	 surrounded	 by danger	keeps	your	senses	alert.	I	never	allowed	myself	to	drop	my	guard.	That's</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	 kept	 me	 alive.	 Survival	 meant	 finding	 a	 community,	 sharing	 resources, having	others	watch	your	back,	pulling	together.	I	didn’t	want	to	live	alone,	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You're	 lucky	 though,”	 repeated	 Bob.	 “You've	 got	 skills,	 something	 Hurst</p>
<p class="calibre1">needed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	that	then?	My	rugged	good	looks?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bob	laughed,	shaking	his	head.	“No,	I	meant	your	builder	skills.	The	fact	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 can	 fix	 stuff.	 Repair	 walls,	 plumbing,	 that	 kind	 of	 thing.	 Those	 are	 in demand	now.	So	much	to	do	all	the	time.	You	take	all	that	for	granted,	but	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rest	 of	 us	 have	 had	 to	 learn	 most	 of	 that	 for	 the	 first	 time.	 How	 to	 fight,	 look after	animals,	grow	food,	store	rainwater.	You	learned	all	that	growing	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	 squinted	 at	 Bob,	 sizing	 him	 up.	 He	 was	 an	 office	 worker,	 ill-suited	 to this	 new	 world.	 Bob	 was	 right;	 he	 took	 his	 upbringing	 for	 granted,	 but	 it	 had trained	him	to	survive,	to	stay	alive.	He	took	another	draw	on	the	cigarette	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned	his	head	towards	the	squeak	of	brakes	and	a	low	rumble	in	the	distance</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	a	diesel	engine.	There	was	an	urgent	tap	on	the	window	from	the	upstairs</p>
<p class="calibre1">room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 was	 gesturing	 for	 them	 both	 to	 get	 inside.	 The	 approaching	 convoy</p>
<p class="calibre1">navigated	 around	 the	 debris	 in	 the	 street.	 In	 the	 distance	 a	 delivery	 lorry	 was parked	perpendicular	to	the	road,	backed	up	to	a	shop.	Its	doors	were	still	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Its	driver	slumped	over	the	wheel,	the	windscreen	shattered	by	a	bullet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	ducked,	wondering	if	they	had	seen	him.	He	flicked	his	cigarette	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">gutter	 from	 the	 top	 step	 and	 went	 back	 inside,	 closing	 the	 door	 quietly	 behind him.	 Bob	 beckoned	 him	 over,	 put	 his	 finger	 to	 his	 lips	 and	 they	 both	 crouched under	 the	 windowsill	 as	 the	 convoy	 came	 into	 view.	 They	 could	 hear	 Riley’s footsteps	on	the	floor	above	as	she	took	up	position	watching	the	road	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">upstairs	bedroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 convoy	 slowed	 and	 stopped	 not	 twenty	 metres	 from	 where	 they	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">hiding.	The	lead	 vehicle	was	a	 top-of-the-line	Range	Rover,	 an	Overfinch	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">four	male	occupants.	Just	behind	were	a	red	Transit	van,	a	people	carrier	and	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">beaten-up	Peugeot	estate	car,	panting	noisily	at	the	rear. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>Will	 peeked	 again	 but	 ducked	 quickly	 as	 the	 car	 doors	 opened	 and	 he	 saw about	 a	 dozen	 men	 begin	 unloading	 their	 gear.	 They	 were	 well	 organised, </p>
<p class="calibre1">heavily	 armed	 with	 automatic	 weapons.	 Several	 of	 them	 were	 dressed	 in	 dark combat	fatigues	and	camouflage	jackets.	Shielded	from	view	behind	a	white	net</p>
<p class="calibre1">curtain,	 the	 pair	 watched	 the	 group.	 The	 leader,	 a	 clean-shaven	 man	 with	 slick brown	hair,	black	combat	trousers	and	a	dark	Barbour	jacket	stood	talking	to	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">others.	 He	 was	 giving	 instructions	 and	 pointing	 towards	 the	 shops	 and	 houses down	the	road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	 of	 the	 men	 with	 an	 automatic	 rifle	 slung	 under	 his	 arm	 looked	 over towards	 the	 house	 where	 they	 were	 hiding.	 He	 was	 studying	 the	 door	 with crowbar	marks	near	the	lock.	His	eyes	flicked	down	and	locked	on	to	the	still-lit</p>
<p class="calibre1">cigarette	smouldering	in	the	gutter.	He	whistled	through	his	teeth	to	get	the	rest</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	group’s	attention	and	wandered	over,	scanning	the	first-floor	windows.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">picked	up	the	cigarette	butt,	put	it	to	his	lips	and	inhaled	deeply	before	stubbing it	out	under	a	heavy	boot.	Pressing	his	face	to	the	glass,	he	cupped	his	hands	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	ground-floor	window,	shielding	the	reflection	and	peered	in.	One	of	the	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">men	 joined	 him	 outside	 the	 house	 and	 with	 a	 silent	 nod	 from	 his	 partner	 he raised	his	rifle	butt	and	smashed	in	the	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Glass	showered	down	onto	Will	and	Bob.	They	didn’t	have	time	to	get	away, </p>
<p class="calibre1">falling	 backwards,	 hands	 protecting	 their	 faces	 from	 the	 glass	 and	 glare	 of	 the outside	light.	A	rifle	was	now	pointed	at	their	heads	by	the	silhouetted	figure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Keep	your	hands	up	where	I	can	see	them.	Stand	up.	Slowly,	slowly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bob	and	Will	did	exactly	as	they	were	told. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	are	you?	And	what	are	you	doing	here?”	demanded	the	man	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rifle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	moved	further	towards	them,	no	longer	haloed	by	the	bright	sunlight,	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	 could	 get	 a	 proper	 look	 at	 him	 without	 squinting.	 He	 looked	 paramilitary, wearing	the	same	improvised	uniform	as	the	others	they	had	observed,	probably</p>
<p class="calibre1">stolen	 en	 masse	 from	 a	 department	 store	 or	 outfitters.	 He	 was	 heavily	 bearded with	steely	eyes	set	slightly	too	close	together.	Will	determined	to	appeal	to	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">better	nature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	just	looking	for	food,	that’s	all.”	Will	kept	his	hands	behind	his	head, </p>
<p class="calibre1">trying	 to	 remain	 calm	 and	 not	 provoke	 the	 man,	 feeling	 the	 blade	 of	 the	 knife pressed	 against	 his	 thigh	 in	 its	 leather	 scabbard.	 He	 wondered	 whether	 Bob could	distract	him	while	he	made	a	lunge	for	his	throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s	the	rest	of	your	group?”	said	the	man	towering	over	Will,	pointing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	rifle	from	one	to	the	other.	He	was	on	edge.	Try	to	keep	him	calm,	thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">Will,	keep	him	talking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	just	the	two	of	us,”	Will	lied.	“This	is	Bob	and	I’m	Will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>The	man	looked	past	them	into	the	room,	unconvinced.	He	waved	to	the	other men	 to	 take	 a	 look	 inside.	 Just	 then,	 the	 radio	 in	 Bob’s	 pocket	 crackled	 with static. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Give	me	that,”	scowled	the	man	with	the	rifle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	local,	Will	was	sure	of	that.	He	looked	half-familiar.	Bob	reluctantly</p>
<p class="calibre1">passed	him	the	radio.	He	turned	it	over	in	his	free	hand,	stepping	aside	as	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">joined	by	his	leader,	the	man	from	the	Overfinch,	shaking	his	head	at	Bob	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Will.	 The	 black	 Barbour	 jacket	 he	 wore	 looked	 brand	 new,	 with	 a	 crisp	 black shirt	and	tie,	cargo	trousers	and	polished	shoes.	He	looked	a	little	like	a	bailiff	to Will,	with	the	same	air	of	menace	and	efficiency	about	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	the	two	of	you,	eh?	So	who’s	that	on	the	radio	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 voice	 was	 distinctive,	 educated.	 He	 was	 never	 very	 good	 with	 regional accents.	Somewhere	up	north?	Manchester	was	his	best	guess.	Bob	stared	back, </p>
<p class="calibre1">trying	to	think	of	a	convincing	response.	“It’s	not	our	radio.	We	just	found	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	in	black	stared	back	at	him,	his	head	tilted	to	one	side.	“Don’t	try</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 patience.”	 He	 raised	 the	 radio	 to	 his	 mouth	 and	 pressed	 the	 button	 to	 talk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	a	message	for	the	friends	of	Bob	and	Will.	If	you	want	to	see	them	again</p>
<p class="calibre1">alive,	come	out	now	and	show	your	faces.	You	will	not	be	harmed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	nothing	but	static. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Last	 chance.	 I’ll	 count	 to	 five	 and	 then	 one	 of	 them	 dies.”	 He	 counted slowly,	staring	blankly	at	the	pair	of	them.	Will	glowered	back	defiantly	as	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">count	reached	its	conclusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	raised	his	gun	and	pointed	directly	at	Bob’s	head.	“Time’s	up.	Come</p>
<p class="calibre1">out,	come	out,	wherever	you	are,	this	is	your	last	chance	before	one	of	them	dies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eenie,	meenie,	miney,	mo…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	 interrupted	 him.	 “Look,	 we’re	 just	 looking	 for	 food.	 Please,	 check	 the rucksacks,	take	what	you	want,	just	let	us	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 with	 the	 rifle	 rummaged	 through	 their	 packs	 and	 confirmed	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">contents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	many	of	you	are	there?	Where’s	your	base?	Tell	me,	now,”	the	man	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">black	shouted,	frustrated	with	their	refusal	to	cooperate.	He	looked	like	the	sort</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	person	who	was	used	to	getting	his	own	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bob	 shifted	 uncomfortably.	 He	 seemed	 on	 the	 verge	 of	 caving	 in.	 With	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fierce	stare,	Will	cautioned	him	to	keep	quiet.	The	exchange	of	glances	was	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">lost	on	the	man	in	black.	He	pointed	to	Bob	and	slid	his	finger	across	his	throat. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The	single	shot	was	muffled	but	unmistakeable	from	across	the	street.	Zed	paced</p>

<p class="calibre1">“We	can’t	risk	going	over	there,”	he	whispered,	peering	through	the	shaft	of</p>

<p class="calibre1">“We	can’t	just	sit	here	and	do	nothing,”	challenged	Mila	angrily,	encouraging</p>

<p class="calibre1">Mila	scowled	at	him.	She	didn’t	like	it,	but	she	didn’t	have	a	better	plan.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew	he	was	right.	Maybe,	just	maybe,	it	had	been	a	warning	shot	designed	to</p>

<p class="calibre1">Across	 the	 street,	 the	 door	 opened	 and	 Will	 was	 marched	 out	 towards	 the people	carrier,	his	hands	tied	behind	his	back.	There	was	no	sign	of	Riley.	The</p>

<p class="calibre1">Zed	 waited	 five	 minutes	 to	 make	 sure	 no	 one	 had	 stayed	 behind	 and	 then stole	across	the	street.	Inside,	he	met	Riley	coming	down	the	stairs. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Jack	grabbed	the	last	of	the	sacks,	heavier	than	the	previous	dozen.	With	Sam’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">help,	they	cradled	the	load	between	them,	walking	sideways,	cheeks	puffed	out, </p>
<p class="calibre1">towards	 the	 pontoon	 and	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>.	 Its	 engines	 were	 throbbing	 rhythmically, ready	 to	 leave,	 water	 spurting	 from	 the	 engine	 outlet	 every	 few	 seconds.	 They stowed	 the	 last	 sack	 with	 the	 others,	 brim-full	 of	 potatoes	 and	 carrots,	 neatly tucked	 in	 rows,	 made	 fast	 with	 a	 frayed	 rope	 under	 the	 bulwark	 at	 the	 stern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	hauled	a	large	blue	tarpaulin	tight	to	keep	their	cargo	dry	and	stop	it	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">sliding	with	each	roll	of	the	waves,	not	to	mention	the	wind	and	weather	on	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning’s	voyage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	looked	up	at	the	grey	skies,	his	eyebrows	furrowed	at	the	sight	of	dark</p>
<p class="calibre1">clouds	 threatening	 in	 the	 south-east,	 bringing	 squalls	 and	 rain.	 Nothing	 to	 get excited	 about,	 mind	 you	 but	 he	 was	 experienced	 enough	 as	 a	 skipper	 to	 never underestimate	a	storm	and	its	ability	to	create	havoc	even	in	the	sheltered	waters</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	Solent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	  <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>	 cast	 off	 and	 angled	 away	 from	 the	 jetty,	 heading	 out	 under	 full engine	into	the	deeper	waters	of	the	shipping	channel.	They	made	towards	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">first	 port	 of	 call	 just	 a	 few	 miles	 away	 east	 towards	 Cowes.	 Looking	 south towards	 the	 Isle	 of	 Wight,	 they	 passed	 Fort	 Albert,	 converted	 into	 luxury apartments	several	decades	ago	but	unsuitable	to	host	a	group	of	any	reasonable</p>
<p class="calibre1">size.	Despite	its	Napoleonic	grandeur	and	imposing	position,	facing	Hurst	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">opposite	side	of	the	western	entrance	to	the	Solent,	it	looked	deserted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Passing	 Yarmouth,	 Sam	 pointed	 to	 the	 harbour	 entrance	 where	 The	 George</p>
<p class="calibre1">hotel	 had	 once	 stood,	 next	 to	 the	 ferry	 port.	 Little	 now	 remained.	 It	 was	 a burned-out	 wreck.	 Its	 ancient	 timbers	 lay	 blackened	 and	 broken	 where	 it	 had collapsed	in	a	fire.	Jack	shook	his	head,	remembering	the	many	nights	out	he	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">enjoyed	in	Yarmouth	pubs	with	friends	and	acquaintances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	distance	loomed	the	enormous	hulk	of	the	 <i class="calibre4">Maersk	Charlotte</i>,	its	decks stacked	seven	or	eight	stories	high	with	containers	of	all	different	colours.	Jack</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	from	a	distance	it	looked	like	a	giant	Lego	ship,	but	as	they	got	closer	its true	 scale	 was	 breathtaking.	 Nearly	 one	 thousand	 feet	 of	 Sovereign	 class</p>
<p class="calibre1">shipping	vessel.	Its	hull	was	painted	a	pale	blue,	with	a	rectory-red	waterline	just visible,	 fully	 laden	 as	 she	 was.	 On	 board,	 its	 modest	 crew	 of	 fifteen	 had	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>swollen	by	dozens	of	others	taking	refuge.	Without	unloading	the	containers	on shore,	 their	 cargo	 was	 mostly	 useless	 or	 inaccessible.	 However,	 many	 of	 those opened	 onboard	 yielded	 unusual	 and	 unexpected	 treasures.	 Four	 hundred</p>
<p class="calibre1">thousand	 litres	 of	 bottled	 water,	 three	 thousand	 kilos	 of	 white	 rice,	 a	 dozen Yamaha	 pianos,	 four	 Kawasaki	 motorbikes,	 cut	 timber,	 plastic	 sheeting	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">tents.	Humanitarian	aid	no	doubt	heading	for	Somalia,	Ethiopia	or	Sierra	Leone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 list	 of	 containerised	 goods	 went	 on	 and	 on.	 A	 veritable	 treasure	 trove,	 a modern-day	Aladdin’s	cave.	The	ship	had	set	up	shop	as	a	floating	trading	post, </p>
<p class="calibre1">open	for	business	day	and	night,	ready	to	trade	with	whoever	and	whatever	came</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 <i class="calibre4">Charlotte</i>’s	captain,	Anders	Bjørklund,	was	an	amiable	Norwegian.	Like</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack,	 he	 had	 served	 in	 his	 country’s	 navy	 for	 many	 years	 before	 retiring	 and taking	command	of	a	container	ship.	He	had	travelled	the	world	and	had	the	Tshirts	to	prove	it,	literally.	He	had	more	tall	tales	of	nautical	adventures,	of	wives and	 beautiful	 ladies,	 to	 entertain	 the	 small	 company	 who	 gathered	 to	 drink Ukrainian	 vodka	 and	 eat	 meatballs	 in	 their	 comfortable	 ship’s	 canteen.	 Somali pirates	had	boarded	no	less	than	three	times,	or	so	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rounding	 the	 stern	 and	 entering	 the	 wind	 shadow	 created	 by	 the	 ship’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">enormous	hull,	Jack	shifted	the	throttle	into	neutral.	Using	the	tide	to	take	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	 and	 come	 slowly	 alongside,	 he	 waited	 patiently	 for	 the	 stairway	 to	 be lowered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 <i class="calibre4">Charlotte</i>,	like	so	many	of	her	sister	ships,	had	been	heavily	fortified	to counter	 the	 threat	 of	 pirates	 in	 the	 Gulf	 of	 Aden	 on	 its	 route	 through	 the	 Suez Canal	 past	 Somalia.	 Its	 walkways	 were	 caged,	 with	 gates	 compartmentalising access	to	parts	of	the	ship.	Fire	hoses	were	mounted	on	the	guardrail	to	ward	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	 skiffs	 or	 high-speed	 launches	 that	 got	 too	 close.	 These	 defences	 had provided	 welcome	 protection	 against	 unwanted	 visitors	 in	 the	 Solent.	 Her	 hull was	roughly	painted	with	warning	messages	to	deter	the	curious	and	inquisitive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	most	prominent	of	them	read	“Boarders	will	be	shot:	do	not	approach	within</p>
<p class="calibre1">50	metres”. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	 of	 the	 crew	 appeared	 at	 the	 rail	 and	 waved	 to	 them,	 cigarette	 hanging from	his	lips.	He	grabbed	the	bowline	from	Sam	and	fended	off	the	fishing	boat</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	it	came	alongside.	Once	they	were	secure	fore	and	aft,	Jack	and	Sam	climbed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	stairs	and	came	aboard	the	 <i class="calibre4">Charlotte</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Ten</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 a	 cursory	 pat-down	 and	 bag	 search	 for	 concealed	 weapons,	 the	 Filipino deckhand	 led	 them	 in	 silence	 along	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Maersk	Charlotte</i>’s	 walkway	 through	 a series	of	locked	gates	and	stairways	up	towards	the	bridge	and	the	main	entrance</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 crew	 quarters.	 Sam	 looked	 nervous	 as	 the	 gate	 was	 padlocked	 again behind	them,	locking	them	in,	but	Jack’s	silent	nod	reassured	him.	The	deckhand</p>
<p class="calibre1">heaved	open	a	large	watertight	door	and	they	stepped	over	the	raised	edge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside,	the	air	was	warm	and	stale.	It	stank	of	unwashed	bodies,	mildew	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">boiled	 cabbages.	 Their	 rubber	 boots	 squeaked	 noisily	 on	 linoleum	 tiles	 that stretched	out	in	front	of	them	to	the	left	and	right.	They	headed	up	another	flight of	 stairs	 and	 through	 an	 interior	 doorway	 into	 a	 brightly	 lit	 soft-seating	 area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bookcases	 and	 posters	 of	 swimwear	 models	 decorated	 the	 walls,	 together	 with table	tennis	and	football	apparatus.	They	found	Anders	talking	animatedly	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 second	 in	 command,	 a	 younger	 man	 with	 designer	 stubble	 and	 an	 angular face.	 Anders	 rose	 and	 greeted	 them	 warmly,	 throwing	 both	 arms	 wide	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">embrace	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	good	friend,	Jack.	Welcome,	welcome.	How	are	you?	And	here	we	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam,	I	think.	You	are	well	too,	I	hope?	What	have	you	brought	me	today?	Come, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sit,	have	some	coffee,	relax.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	took	a	seat	opposite	Anders	and	helped	himself	to	freshly	brewed	coffee</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 a	 large	 metal	 pot.	 Proper	 coffee,	 thought	 Jack	 to	 himself.	 Anders	 always had	the	best	of	everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anders’	 second	 in	 command	 sat	 arms	 crossed,	 watching	 Jack	 as	 he	 inhaled</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 delicious	 aroma	 of	 freshly	 roasted	 coffee	 with	 his	 eyes	 closed,	 savouring every	 second.	 When	 Jack	 looked	 up	 from	 his	 moment	 of	 indulgence,	 the	 man opposite	 held	 his	 gaze	 and	 nodded	 slightly,	 acknowledging	 Jack’s	 gratitude	 for the	simple	pleasure	of	a	good	cup	of	coffee.	Standing	over	by	the	bookshelves, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	 held	 back	 from	 the	 others	 and	 perched	 nervously	 on	 the	 side	 of	 a	 trestle table	erected	next	to	the	wall,	watching	the	three	men	carefully,	listening	intently to	their	conversation	from	a	respectful	distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	you	remember	Victor,	my	first	officer,”	said	Anders.	“He	just	came</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	 from	 Portsmouth.	 You	 made	 many	 new	 friends,	 I	 think,	 yes?”	 he	 said, nudging	his	first	officer. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>Victor	 nodded	 and	 smiled,	 revealing	 a	 gold	 tooth.	 He	 leaned	 forward	 and grabbed	 a	 shortbread	 biscuit,	 snapping	 one	 ostentatiously	 between	 his	 teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps,”	 he	 replied	 enigmatically,	 raising	 his	 eyebrows	 and	 waving	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">remaining	half	of	the	biscuit	in	small	circles,	his	mouth	still	full. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	thought	Victor	looked	rather	pleased	with	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 have,	 how	 do	 you	 say…?”	 Victor	 paused,	 considering	 for	 a	 second, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“established	lines	of	communication.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	most	likely	Polish	or	Latvian,	Jack	wasn’t	sure,	he	couldn’t	place	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">heavily	accented	English,	other	than	somewhere	in	Eastern	Europe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anders	 took	 over	 the	 story,	 his	 patience	 with	 Victor’s	 amateur	 dramatics</p>
<p class="calibre1">exhausted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	are	talking	with	the	Royal	Navy	in	Portsmouth.	Or	rather,	what’s	left	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">them.	Out	of	seventeen	thousand	personnel,	there	are	less	than	four	hundred	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">there,	 holed	 up	 like	 rats	 in	 the	 old	 naval	 dockyard.	 It	 would	 seem	 that	 all	 their weapons	and	fences	and	ships	couldn’t	keep	the	virus	out.	Victor	here	met	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 leader,	 Captain	 Armstrong.	 He	 is	 someone	 we	 can	 do	 business	 with,	 I think.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 what	 news	 from	 anywhere	 else?	 Are	 they	 in	 contact	 with	 other</p>
<p class="calibre1">groups?”	asked	Jack	hopefully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 did	 not	 say,”	 said	 Victor	 curtly	 with	 a	 dismissive	 wave.	 “I	 did	 not	 ask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 were	 too	 busy	 talking	 about	 other	 things.”	 Victor	 leaned	 back	 in	 his	 seat, looking	relaxed	and	smug,	like	the	cat	that	got	the	cream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anders	 took	 over	 again.	 “You	 tease	 them	 too	 much,	 Victor.	 Look,	 we	 have something,	maybe,	you	might	be	interested	in,	Jack.	Something	good.	You	want</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	look?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 looked	 intrigued	 and	 nodded.	 They	 rose	 as	 a	 group	 and	 Jack	 and	 Sam followed	 the	 other	 two	 men	 down	 a	 narrow	 corridor,	 under	 strip	 lighting	 that flickered	from	time	to	time.	They	entered	a	larger	hold	below	the	main	deck.	In</p>
<p class="calibre1">boxed	 wooden	 crates,	 their	 lids	 already	 crowbarred	 open,	 lay	 what	 looked	 like rifles	secured	in	grey	cut-out	foam	to	protect	them	in	transit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anders	reached	in	and	lifted	one	out.	Turning	it	over	to	inspect	the	sights	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">stock,	 he	 pulled	 back	 the	 firing	 pin	 and	 inspected	 the	 empty	 chamber.	 Jack recognised	them	instantly	from	his	time	in	the	service.	They	were	standard-issue</p>
<p class="calibre1">SA80s	used	throughout	the	British	military.	What	he	wouldn’t	give	for	a	few	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">those	 for	 the	 guys	 back	 at	 the	 castle,	 rather	 than	 farmers’	 shotguns	 and	 barely functioning	museum	pieces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 also	 have	 ammunition,	 9mm	 pistols,	 grenades	 and	 this	 beauty.”	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">reached	 down	 and	 patted	 a	 larger	 tripod	 mounted	 machine	 gun,	 with	 boxes	 of ammunition	 stacked	 next	 to	 it.	 “Quite	 a	 haul,	 yes?”	 Anders	 looked	 incredibly</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>pleased	with	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Impressive,	Anders.	How	much	did	that	little	lot	cost	you?”	asked	Jack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	pretty	penny.	But	worth	it.	Your	Royal	Navy	was	very	willing	to	trade.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">took	 a	 bit	 of	 persuasion	 of	 course,	 but	 they	 have	 hundreds	 and	 hundreds	 of weapons	 and	 no	 one	 left	 to	 fire	 them.	 They	 are	 as	 useless	 as	 ice	 cream	 to	 an Eskimo.	Is	that	the	expression?	Or	coals	to	Newcastle,	I	like	better.	Meanwhile</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 have	 no,	 shall	 we	 say,	 creature	 comforts.	 Food,	 yes,	 but	 hardly	 any cigarettes,	 drink,	 and	 certainly	 no	 recreational	 drugs.	 What	 can	 I	 say?	 The captain	 likes	 his	 Russian	 vodka.	 We	 let	 him	 have	 half	 a	 dozen	 cases,	 for	 now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	enough	pills	to	make	them	forget	all	about	the	virus.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 eyed	 the	 merchandise	 greedily,	 stroking	 his	 chin	 thoughtfully.	 “But, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anders,	 we	 both	 know	 he	 doesn’t	 have	 what	 I	 have.	 Fresh	 vegetables,	 bread baked	 this	 morning,	 home-grown	 apples	 picked	 yesterday	 from	 our	 orchard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Very	 hard	 to	 come	 by.	 I	 have	 your	 usual	 delivery	 if	 your	 men	 can	 give	 me	 a hand.	In	exchange	for,	shall	we	say,	five	of	those	rifles	and	a	couple	of	pistols? </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’ll	take	as	much	ammunition	as	you	can	spare.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anders	 wagged	 his	 finger.	 “Well,	 it	 is	 true,	 we	 are	 very	 fond	 of	 Hurst potatoes	and	cabbage.	Not	so	much	the	carrots,	too	sweet.	Makes	a	change	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">tinned	vegetables.	Keeps	us	healthy,	no?”	He	laughed,	stroking	his	paunch.	“We</p>
<p class="calibre1">grow	fat	and	lazy	here.	Not	like	you,	Jack.	While	you	work,	we	have	little	to	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">here	but	eat	and	drink	all	day	long.	It	is	very	tiresome.”	He	chortled	at	his	own</p>
<p class="calibre1">joke	and	considered	Jack’s	proposal,	moving	his	head	from	side	to	side.	“But	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 and	 me	 we	 are	 old	 friends,	 why	 don’t	 we	 say	 three	 rifles,	 two	 pistols	 and bullets	for	both?	When	you	bring	me	more,	we	can	trade	again.	There	are	plenty</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	 where	 these	 came	 from.	 And	 our	 new	 friends	 at	 the	 Royal	 Navy	 have unlimited	stores	to	equip	a	whole	army.	I’m	sure	if	we	asked	nicely	we	could	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 a	 helicopter,	 perhaps.	 He	 has	 a	 whole	 store	 of	 engine	 parts	 and	 electrical spares.	You	name	it.	Victor	has	seen	it.	They	have	a	set-up	to	die	for.	They	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	hospital,	accommodation	for	hundreds,	fences	and	soldiers	to	keep	them	safe, </p>
<p class="calibre1">cooks	and	kitchens.	It	is	sanctuary,	my	friend.	They	could	take	all	of	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	why	are	you	still	here,	Anders?	Why	did	Victor	come	back?	Sounds	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	found	something	better.	A	way	out	of	all	this.	A	return	to	normality.	A	new</p>
<p class="calibre1">start.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because…”	Anders	paused,	wagging	his	finger	at	Jack.	“I	do	not	trust	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	besides,”	he	went	on,	stretching	both	arms	wide,	looking	around	him,	“how</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	I	leave	the	 <i class="calibre4">Charlotte</i>?	This	is	my	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 drained	 his	 cup	 and	 nodded.	 He	 knew	 exactly	 what	 Anders	 meant.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt	 the	 same	 way	 about	 Hurst.	 It	 would	 take	 something	 special	 to	 make	 him leave	his	adopted	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Eleven</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	and	Sam	unloaded	the	share	of	their	cargo	that	belonged	to	Anders	in	return</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 the	 rifles,	 boxes	 of	 ammunition	 and	 a	 few	 other	 assorted	 items,	 including personal	gifts	from	Anders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 Anders’	 “thing”,	 an	 indulgent	 and	 entirely	 sentimental	 act	 he	 always undertook	when	he	knew	Jack	was	coming.	He	took	great	care	in	selecting	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">toys	for	the	Hurst	children,	whom	he	knew	by	name.	Boxed	 <i class="calibre4">Transformers</i>	for	the boys,  <i class="calibre4">Toy	Story</i>	figurines	for	the	girls.	He	normally	added	a	couple	of	bottles	of vodka	and	cigarettes	for	the	grown-ups. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	shook	hands	with	Anders,	the	two	of	them	standing	on	the	bottom	step</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	stairway	exchanging	warm	farewells.	Sam	uncleated	the	bowline	and	left</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 on	 a	 slip,	 ready	 to	 cast	 off	 as	 soon	 as	 Jack	 was	 back	 on	 board.	 There	 was	 a strong	swell	running	that	made	the	 <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>’s	gunwale	rise	and	fall	two	metres	as each	wave	surged	past.	The	small	fishing	boat	yawed	from	side	to	side,	making</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	jump	treacherous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	stood	poised	on	the	narrow	platform,	waiting	for	the	optimum	moment</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 step	 aboard.	 When	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>	 rose	 on	 an	 approaching	 wave,	 he	 balanced gracefully	on	the	raised	gunwale	and	jumped	the	last	few	feet	to	the	deck	next	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	fishing	nets.	Sam	cast	off	the	stern	and	raced	the	length	of	the	boat	to	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	same	at	the	bow.	They	drifted	back	along	the	towering	hull	of	the	 <i class="calibre4">Charlotte,</i> angling	away	and	heading	west,	onwards	on	the	last	leg	of	their	journey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	 final	 destination	 on	 this	 morning’s	 excursion	 was	 Spitbank	 and	 No</p>
<p class="calibre1">Man’s	 Land	 forts.	 The	 two	 forts,	 passive	 sentinels	 for	 some	 one	 hundred	 and fifty	years,	stood	guard	over	the	shipping	lanes	at	the	eastern	end	of	the	Solent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 were	 both	 accessible	 by	 boat	 from	 the	 mainland	 via	 Gosport	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Portsmouth,	 or	 from	 the	 island	 via	 Ryde.	 Together	 with	 Hurst	 and	 the	 other Solent	forts,	they	made	up	a	formidable	chain	of	castles,	forts	and	shore	batteries constructed	during	Napoleonic	times	to	defend	Portsmouth	against	the	threat	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">invasion	 by	 the	 French.	 The	 fortifications	 had	 made	 this	 stretch	 of	 English coastline	one	of	the	most	heavily	defended	in	the	world.	In	the	end,	the	forts	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">fallen	victim	not	to	attack	but	to	the	advance	of	naval	weaponry.	Modern,	longer-</p>
<p class="calibre1">range	 cannon,	 not	 to	 mention	 the	 advent	 of	 peace,	 had	 combined	 to	 ensure	 the forts'	obsolescence,	soon	after	completion. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>Today,	 the	 forts	 stood	 isolated	 and	 windswept.	 Yet	 they	 had	 lost	 nothing	 of their	imposing	grandeur. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	 Hurst,	 the	 inaccessibility	 of	 Spitbank	 and	 No	 Man’s	 Land	 was	 both	 a tonic	 and	 a	 boon	 to	 the	 survivor	 groups	 that	 occupied	 them.	 On	 one	 hand,	 the forts	 provided	 a	 sanctuary	 from	 the	 chaos	 and	 disorder	 that	 had	 befallen	 towns and	villages	on	the	mainland.	On	the	other,	their	inaccessibility	was	a	curse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 said	 that	 the	 occupants	 of	 the	 forts	 had	 watched	 the	 events	 on	 the mainland	unfold	with	a	strange	detachment.	Huddled	round	their	single	working</p>
<p class="calibre1">radio	set,	they	listened	to	the	news	reports	of	spreading	sickness	and	widespread</p>
<p class="calibre1">rioting	from	the	relative	safety	of	the	forts.	It	reminded	the	older	members	of	the group	of	the	Blitz,	so	many	years	before.	They	shook	their	heads	with	growing</p>
<p class="calibre1">concern	until,	several	days	later,	all	live	broadcasts	ceased	transmission.	Looped</p>
<p class="calibre1">public	 safety	 announcements	 were	 all	 that	 remained,	 telling	 people	 to	 stay indoors.	When	the	power	grid	failed,	all	they	heard	was	white	noise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fuel	for	the	forts'	generators	ran	dangerously	low,	and	was	held	in	reserve	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">winter.	When	the	oil	ran	out,	they	became	wholly	dependent	on	scavenging	trips</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 fuel	 and	 food.	 Their	 first	 choice	 was	 to	 head	 to	 the	 island	 where	 the	 lower population	density	made	things	a	little	safer.	Scavenging	trips	to	Portsmouth	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gosport	were	more	lucrative	but	considered	too	dangerous.	The	forts’	occupancy</p>
<p class="calibre1">numbers	had	dwindled	as	supplies	grew	increasingly	scarce,	driving	many	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today,	 only	 a	 small	 group	 could	 be	 sustained	 at	 both	 sites,	 of	 some	 twenty	 or thirty	souls	each. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 stopped	 first	 at	 No	 Man’s	 Land	 and	 stood	 on	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>’s	 foredeck exchanging	pleasantries	with	Shannon,	a	fisherman’s	widow	and	formerly	a	café</p>
<p class="calibre1">owner	from	Cowes	before	the	breakdown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	 secured	 the	 large	 lifting	 hook	 from	 the	 pulley	 to	 hoist	 the	 last	 of	 the sacks	while	a	young	man	above	directed	proceedings.	Sam	held	the	sack	steady</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	first	part	of	its	ascent	as	it	swung	out	over	the	water	in	the	light	breeze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 grey	 foam	 clung	 to	 the	 lower	 rungs	 of	 the	 ladder.	 Waves	 lapped</p>
<p class="calibre1">rhythmically	 against	 the	 base	 of	 the	 fort,	 alternately	 exposing	 and	 covering	 the green	and	brown	seaweed	that	clung	to	the	stone.	When	the	last	of	the	sacks	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">lifted	off	the	deck,	they	lowered	two	large	fuel	drums	full	of	diesel	and	a	small</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kawasaki	portable	generator	being	offered	in	exchange	before	casting	off.	Jack</p>
<p class="calibre1">steered	the	 <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>	the	short	distance	to	Spitbank,	as	a	strengthening	wind	drove them	onwards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 had	 made	 this	 trip	 a	 dozen	 times.	 The	  <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>	 came	 surging	 up	 to	 the rusted	 iron	 and	 steel	 stairwell	 that	 stretched	 from	 the	 very	 top	 of	 the	 wall	 and plunged	fifteen	feet	into	the	murky	depths	below	the	waterline.	The	waves	here</p>
<p class="calibre1">rolled	in	from	the	Channel,	smashing	against	the	stone	and	sloshing	between	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>supporting	columns.	At	the	last	minute,	Jack	jammed	the	engine	astern	and	the <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>	slowed	abruptly	to	a	complete	stop,	two	or	three	feet	from	the	platform. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	 looped	 a	 line	 round	 an	 iron	 ring	 as	 the	 boat	 began	 drifting	 back	 in	 the current. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Spitbank	fort	was	circular	in	shape.	Its	thick	stone	walls	were	reinforced	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">iron,	 built	 to	 withstand	 cannon	 fire	 from	 the	 marauding	 French.	 Its	 own	 gun ports	 now	 stood	 vacant	 and	 bricked	 up,	 where	 cannon	 would	 have	 faced</p>
<p class="calibre1">seawards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	reached	up	at	head	height	and	heaved	himself	off	the	 <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>,	climbing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 stairwell	 towards	 the	 main	 entrance	 set	 thirty	 feet	 clear	 of	 the	 waves.	 He stopped	 midway	 up	 to	 look	 back	 and	 admire	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>	 from	 above.	 The reinforced	 glass	 in	 her	 small	 wheelhouse	 reflected	 the	 morning	 sun	 as	 she wallowed	 in	 the	 light	 swell.	 Sam	 was	 busy	 tidying	 ropes	 and	 putting	 out	 extra fenders	to	protect	the	bow	from	scraping	against	the	jetty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 the	 top	 of	 the	 stairwell,	 Jack	 found	 the	 place	 deserted,	 its	 heavy	 doors closed	to	visitors.	He	had	grown	used	to	a	welcome	party,	half	a	dozen	smiling</p>
<p class="calibre1">faces,	waving	as	they	approached	the	fort.	There	were	around	thirty	residents	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	last	count,	four	of	five	families,	a	few	children	he	had	grown	fond	of.	Nice</p>
<p class="calibre1">bunch,	 Jack	 thought	 to	 himself.	 This	 morning	 there	 were	 no	 children’s	 faces pressed	to	the	glass,	no	lookout	in	the	main	building,	nothing.	Perhaps	they	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	inside	having	a	late	breakfast.	He	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 tried	 the	 door	 handle	 but	 found	 it	 locked.	 Where	 was	 everyone?	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">cupped	his	hands	to	the	glass	trying	to	peer	inside,	scanning	for	movement.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">tried	 to	 wipe	 away	 the	 salt	 and	 spray	 from	 the	 glass	 but	 realised	 it	 was condensation	 on	 the	 inside.	 He	 rattled	 the	 door	 and	 knocked	 to	 get	 their attention,	 listening	 at	 the	 glass	 for	 the	 sound	 of	 footsteps.	 The	 dark	 shape	 of	 a woman	near	the	door	startled	him	as	she	rose	slowly	from	the	shadows,	adjusting</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	hair	and	wiping	tears	from	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	recognised	the	face	instantly.	Susan,	or	Susie,	as	he	liked	to	call	her.	Her</p>
<p class="calibre1">appearance	was	altered.	She	looked	pale	and	drawn,	dried-up	tears	had	left	dirty</p>
<p class="calibre1">tracks.	Her	eyes	were	dull	and	lifeless.	She	was	no	more	than	thirty,	but	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">older,	her	face	weathered,	pressed	up	close	against	the	glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	reinforced	window	was	built	to	withstand	the	worst	of	the	winter	storms, </p>
<p class="calibre1">thick	enough	to	muffle	her	voice.	He	cupped	his	ear	to	the	crack,	trying	to	make</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	what	she	was	saying	against	the	waves	and	wind	swirling	around	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	let	you	in,	Jack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	words	sent	an	icy	chill	down	his	spine.	She	repeated	them,	shaking	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">head	until	he	understood.	Jack	gulped	and	took	an	involuntary	step	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	did	this	happen?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>“Last	week.	One	of	the	children	got	it	first,	we’re	not	sure	how.	Little	Grace coughed	all	night	and	the	following	morning,	two	more	had	come	down	with	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	were	too	slow,	Jack,	we	didn’t	isolate	them	fast	enough.”	She	shook	her	head</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	tears	started	again.	“In	three	days,	half	of	us	had	it,	and	by	then	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">too	late.	It	spread	so	fast.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	so	sorry,	Susie.	Is	there	anything	we	can	do	for	you?	We	have	food	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">supplies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Save	it,”	she	said	bitterly,	forcing	a	smile.	“Don’t	waste	it	on	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 pressed	 her	 moist	 palm	 to	 the	 glass	 and	 looked	 mournfully	 into	 Jack’s eyes.	He	put	his	own	hand	up	to	mirror	hers.	The	glass	was	cold,	but	he	thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	could	feel	the	faint	warmth	of	her	skin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pray	for	us.	But	don’t	come	back,”	she	called	out,	her	voice	breaking	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">emotion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	managed	a	weak	smile.	“We	will,”	he	mouthed,	nodding	his	head	gently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned,	closing	his	eyes	for	a	moment	and	then	hurried	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	top	level	of	the	stairwell,	he	scratched	a	large	skull	and	crossbones	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 stone	 with	 his	 knife,	 warning	 others	 never	 to	 approach	 this	 cursed	 place again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Twelve</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Picking	 their	 way	 along	 the	 main	 road	 at	 walking	 pace,	 the	 Hurst	 convoy rounded	 abandoned	 cars	 and	 other	 detritus	 that	 littered	 their	 path.	 The	 lead vehicle,	 a	 bulky	 Mitsubishi	 Land	 Cruiser,	 carrying	 Mila	 and	 Riley,	 bumped heavily	over	some	loose	rubble.	With	a	loud	hiss,	their	back	right	tyre	deflated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Mitsubishi	rumbled	over	to	the	side	of	the	street	and	stopped,	scraping	on	its</p>
<p class="calibre1">rims. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 pulled	 in	 behind	 them	 and	 switched	 off	 the	 Land	 Rover’s	 ignition.	 He leaned	forward	over	the	steering	wheel	and	peered	at	the	buildings	to	the	left	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">them,	 scanning	 for	 movement.	 A	 row	 of	 suburban	 houses	 on	 the	 outskirts	 of town	 overlooked	 what	 would	 once	 have	 been	 tidy	 flowerbeds	 full	 of	 roses	 and hydrangea	 bushes	 and	 manicured	 lawns.	 Today,	 those	 same	 gardens	 were	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">impassable	tangle	of	weeds	and	bushes,	grass	growing	lush	and	long.	He	shook</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	head,	muttering	to	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	 what?”	 said	 Sean,	 sat	 in	 the	 passenger	 seat.	 He	 shrugged	 his	 shoulders, oblivious	to	the	danger.	“We	got	a	spare,	yeah?	We	fix	it	and	be	on	our	way.	It’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">take	ten	minutes.	Tops.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 shook	 his	 head.	 “Not	 here.	 Not	 now.	 In	 broad	 daylight?	 If	 that	 convoy comes	through	here	we’ll	be	sitting	ducks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	jumped	out	of	the	car	and	closed	the	driver’s	door	quietly,	not	wanting	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">attract	 any	 unwanted	 attention.	 They	 were	 vulnerable	 here	 and	 needed	 to	 get moving	 fast.	 Riley	 was	 already	 out,	 inspecting	 the	 damage,	 hands	 on	 hips, shaking	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 got	 down	 on	 his	 hands	 and	 knees	 and	 felt	 around	 the	 circumference	 of the	tyre,	feeling	for	a	hole.	He	found	it	quickly.	There	was	a	large	gash	made	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 fallen	 piece	 of	 sharp	 masonry	 and	 glass.	 He	 picked	 out	 a	 couple	 of	 smaller shards	and	dropped	them,	clinking	on	the	tarmac.	He	sat	back	on	his	haunches, </p>
<p class="calibre1">scratching	the	back	of	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sean	stood	behind	him.	“What	do	you	want	to	do,	boss?	Fix	it	or	come	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">later	when	it’s	dark?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 hide	 it	 someplace	 safe	 and	 come	 back.	 There’s	 a	 lock-up	 round	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">corner	we	can	use.	Transfer	all	the	gear	to	the	Land	Rover	and	get	out	of	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	sure	about	this?”	asked	Riley.	“What	with	Bob	and	Will,	and	now	this? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>It’s	not	our	lucky	day.	I	say	we	cut	our	losses	and	come	back	tomorrow	and	start again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	leaving	Will	out	here.	We	find	out	where	they	took	him	and	then	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	the	call.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	unholstered	his	revolver	and	put	another	couple	of	rounds	from	his	breast</p>
<p class="calibre1">pocket	into	the	empty	chambers.	He	spun	the	wheel	and	snapped	it	shut	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">tilt	of	his	wrist.	A	boyish	grin	illuminated	his	face.	Life	felt	better	with	a	loaded gun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Boys	and	their	toys,”	mocked	Riley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	looked	back	at	her,	his	head	cocked	to	one	side.	“We	owe	it	to	Will	to	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">least	try,	don’t	we?	You’d	do	it	for	me,	right,	Riley?”	He	smirked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	shook	her	head	and	walked	away.	They	both	knew	the	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mila	 and	 Sean	 helped	 transfer	 their	 gear	 to	 the	 other	 vehicle.	 Cardboard boxes	and	rucksacks	were	packed	full	of	the	stuff	they	had	scavenged	from	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning’s	 house	 searches.	 It	 was	 food	 mostly,	 plus	 a	 few	 other	 assorted	 items, CDs,	books	and	tools.	The	back	of	the	Land	Rover	was	packed	to	bursting.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	stacked	a	couple	of	boxes	on	the	back	seat,	making	things	a	little	cramped</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	they	all	climbed	back	in,	shoulders	touching.	Zed	was	suddenly	aware	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	warmth	of	Mila’s	wrist	resting	on	his	shoulder.	Her	hand	was	trembling	ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	 slightly.	 He	 grabbed	 her	 hand	 and	 held	 it	 tightly.	 She	 squeezed	 back	 and whispered,	“I’m	scared,	Zed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	forced	a	smile.	“We’ve	been	in	worse	scrapes	than	this.	We’ll	be	fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 had	 driven	 the	 Mitsubishi	 around	 the	 corner,	 its	 back	 tyre	 deflated, bumping	along	on	the	rubber	and	rim.	He	was	gone	for	a	couple	of	minutes,	long</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough	for	Riley	to	worry,	watching	the	street	the	way	he’d	gone.	She	was	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	 to	 follow	 when	 he	 jogged	 back	 into	 view.	 He’d	 parked	 in	 a	 small</p>
<p class="calibre1">residential	cul-de-sac	that	ran	parallel	to	the	main	road.	It	was	well	hidden	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">carport	attached	to	a	semi-detached	retirement	bungalow.	It	would	be	safe	there. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Zed	 climbed	 back	 into	 the	 driver	 seat	 and	 slowly	 pulled	 away.	 If	 his	 hunch was	 right	 they	 were	 no	 more	 than	 a	 mile	 from	 where	 they	 were	 heading, </p>

<p class="calibre1">Road	surfaces	had	degenerated	quickly	without	anyone	to	repair	them.	From</p>
<p class="calibre1">smaller	 potholes,	 vegetation	 spreading	 out	 from	 verges	 and	 walkways,	 weeds and	tree	roots	pushing	through	the	tarmac	and	whole	sections	collapsing,	it	was</p>

<p class="calibre1">heard	talk	of	another	group	holed	up	there	and	thought	he	recognised	one	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">men	 who’d	 taken	 Will.	 He	 knew	 him	 by	 reputation	 only.	 A	 former	 policeman, given	 the	 imaginative	 nickname	 “Copper”	 by	 those	 who	 knew	 him	 locally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Supposedly	one	of	the	good	guys.	Or	at	least	he	used	to	be.	Who	knew	what	he</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Thirteen</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	woke	up	and	blinked	rapidly,	rubbing	his	eyes.	His	sleepy	gaze	fixed	on	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">poster	promoting	safe	sex	with	a	picture	of	two	teenagers	holding	hands.	Above</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 young	 couple	 was	 a	 list	 of	 clinical	 conditions	 and	 names	 for	 sexually transmitted	 diseases,	 superimposed	 on	 a	 fluffy	 cloud.	 Will	 recognised	 some	 of them	but	puzzled	over	others.	Chlamydia?	What	the	hell	was	that?	His	head	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	pounding	and	the	words	danced	a	little,	making	his	vision	swim.	He	shook</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	head	to	try	to	clear	his	thoughts.	A	sharp	pain	made	him	reach	up	and	touch</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	back	of	his	scalp.	His	fingers	came	away	damp	with	blood	that	was	leaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 the	 crude	 gauze	 and	 tape,	 surrounded	 by	 matted	 hair	 crusted	 with	 dried blood.	 He	 tried	 to	 raise	 his	 other	 hand	 but	 it	 jerked	 back,	 handcuffed	 to	 the bedpost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Memories	 of	 earlier	 events	 came	 flooding	 back	 into	 focus.	 The	 scavenging</p>
<p class="calibre1">trip.	Being	discovered	by	the	other	group.	How	had	they	found	them	hiding?	Of</p>
<p class="calibre1">course,	Will,	you	idiot.	The	cigarette	butt.	Stupid	schoolboy	error,	he	thought	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself.	He	remembered	the	hood	over	his	head.	A	short	drive	in	a	large	diesel</p>
<p class="calibre1">vehicle.	 Yes,	 he	 was	 sure	 it	 was	 diesel	 from	 the	 sound	 of	 the	 engine	 and	 the distinctive	smell.	They	had	taken	him	to	a	large	building,	which	he	assumed	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 hospital	 from	 the	 overpowering	 stink	 of	 disinfectant	 that	 masked	 something else	he	couldn’t	place.	His	hunch	was	quickly	confirmed	by	the	sound	of	boots</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	linoleum	tiles	and	what	little	décor	he	could	see	through	the	hood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 closed	 his	 eyes	 and	 tried	 to	 remember.	 It	 was	 all	 a	 jumble.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">interrogation.	 The	 man	 they	 called	 “Copper”	 slapping	 him	 hard	 whenever	 he failed	to	answer	their	incessant	questions,	one	after	the	other	in	quick	succession. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	had	asked	him	about	Hurst,	how	many	people	were	there,	how	they	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">armed.	 So	 many	 questions.	 They	 had	 injected	 him	 with	 something.	 That</p>
<p class="calibre1">explained	why	he	was	still	a	little	light-headed.	His	thoughts	remained	muddled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	sat	bolt	upright	as	one	painful	memory	broke	through	the	fog.	They	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">killed	 Bob.	 Shot	 him	 in	 the	 head.	 The	 neat	 circle	 in	 his	 forehead,	 the	 blood	 on the	 carpet.	 Why?	 They	 didn’t	 need	 to	 kill	 him.	 His	 anger	 boiled	 over	 and	 he slammed	 his	 fist	 down	 against	 his	 knee.	 The	 self-induced	 pain	 helped	 clear	 his head	and	brought	his	situation	in	to	sharper	focus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 hospital	 room	 was	 virtually	 bare,	 a	 private	 overnight	 room	 for	 one</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>person.	Other	than	a	tired-looking	hospital	bed,	there	was	a	cheap	pine	wardrobe and	a	side	table	with	flowers	in	a	vase	that	had	long	since	wilted	and	died,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">water	 green	 and	 stagnant.	 In	 the	 corner	 was	 a	 plastic-looking	 chair	 with	 brown vinyl	upholstery	with	ridges	running	vertically.	A	grey	metal	wall	bracket	for	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">TV	screen,	and	an	aerial	socket	were	the	only	evidence	that	remained	of	creature</p>
<p class="calibre1">comforts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 checked	 the	 drawers	 of	 the	 bedside	 cabinet.	 There	 wasn’t	 even	 a	 Bible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 wait,	 was	 he	 getting	 confused?	 Maybe	 only	 hotels	 had	 Bibles	 next	 to	 the bed?	He	couldn’t	remember,	it	was	all	such	a	long	time	ago	since	he’d	stayed	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	hotel	on	holiday.	The	clean	sheets,	the	buffet	breakfasts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 thin	 layer	 of	 dust	 covered	 the	 whole	 place.	 The	 broken	 blinds	 allowed through	 a	 few	 shafts	 of	 sunlight	 that	 struck	 the	 whitewashed	 walls	 next	 to	 the door.	 Dust	 hung	 heavy	 in	 the	 stale	 air.	 Other	 than	 the	 pervasive	 smell	 of disinfectant,	there	was	something	else	that	lingered.	He	couldn’t	quite	place	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	mind	wandered	as	he	thought	back	to	his	first	job	helping	out	in	a	meat</p>
<p class="calibre1">processing	 plant	 in	 Sandton,	 back	 in	 South	 Africa,	 working	 with	 chicken</p>
<p class="calibre1">carcasses.	 It	 was	 the	 smell	 of	 death	 and	 it	 made	 his	 mouth	 suddenly	 dry	 and devoid	of	saliva. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	window	rattled	a	little	on	its	hinges,	not	quite	closed,	cool	air	seeping	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	got	to	his	feet	and,	leaning	as	far	as	the	cuffs	would	allow	him,	he	managed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	flick	the	corner	of	the	white	aluminium	blinds,	allowing	a	fleeting	glimpse	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	outside	world.	He	was	on	the	second	floor,	and	down	below	he	could	make</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	a	series	of	heaps	on	the	tarmac.	The	blinds	fell	back	into	position	again	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	stretched	and	flicked	them	again.	The	hairs	on	the	back	of	his	neck	stood	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	he	realised	that	one	of	the	heaps	was	piled	with	shoes.	There	were	hundreds	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoes,	of	all	shapes	and	sizes	and	colours.	Children’s	shoes,	high	heels,	brogues, </p>
<p class="calibre1">slippers.	So	many	shoes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 flicked	 the	 blinds	 again,	 leaning	 as	 far	 as	 he	 could.	 The	 next	 heap	 was even	 larger,	 towering	 precariously	 with	 what	 looked	 like	 clothes	 of	 every description.	There	were	trousers,	shirts,	dresses,	coats,	hospital	dressing	gowns, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	socks.	It	reminded	him	of	a	scene	from	a	war	movie	he	had	seen.	What	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 called?	 Allied	 soldiers	 liberating	 prisoner	 camps	 in	 1945,	 finding	 piles	 of clothes	 and	 shoes,	 gold	 teeth,	 reclaimed	 from	 the	 bodies,	 surplus	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">requirements.	 It	 made	 Will	 shudder	 remembering.	 He	 looked	 again	 beyond	 the heaps	where	smoke	was	billowing	from	a	fire	pit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	away	as	the	blinds	fell	back	into	place.	He	realised	with	horror	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 discernible	 shapes	 he	 could	 make	 out	 in	 the	 smouldering	 remains	 were human. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	 closed	 his	 eyes	 and	 wept	 at	 what	 the	 world	 had	 become.	 A	 haphazard</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>descent	 into	 savagery.	 The	 remaining	 vestiges	 of	 civilisation	 falling	 away	 like leaves	from	a	tree.	What	remained	was	barren	and	brittle. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Fourteen</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	 wasn’t	 sure	 how	 long	 he	 had	 slept.	 He	 had	 only	 closed	 his	 eyes	 for	 a second.	His	head	had	stopped	throbbing	so	much.	There	was	a	light	tap	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">door	and	the	sound	of	keys	rattling	in	the	lock.	The	heavy	fire	door	with	a	small</p>
<p class="calibre1">viewing	 window	 swung	 open	 and	 the	 large	 frame	 of	 a	 bearded	 man	 filled	 the doorway.	He	had	a	rifle	with	a	wooden	stock	slung	just	visible	behind	his	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 stepped	 inside	 and	 glanced	 around	 the	 room,	 checking	 that	 Will	 was	 still cuffed	 to	 the	 bed.	 He	 moved	 aside	 for	 a	 young	 man	 wearing	 a	 white	 coat, glasses,	thin	stubble	on	his	chin.	He	was	moderately	tall	with	black	hair,	Indian</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 Pakistani.	 Will	 studied	 him	 closely	 as	 he	 whispered	 with	 the	 guard,	 their exchanges	 awkward,	 as	 if	 the	 doctor	 was	 somehow	 uncomfortable	 in	 his	 own skin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guard	swung	the	heavy	metal	door	closed	behind	him,	sealing	them	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 the	 bustle	 of	 the	 hospital	 beyond.	 Will	 heard	 the	 key	 turn	 and	 heavy footsteps	walk	away	down	the	corridor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	 are	 you	 feeling?”	 asked	 the	 doctor,	 his	 hands	 thrust	 deep	 in	 his	 coat pockets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	 sized	 him	 up	 before	 answering.	 “You	 don’t	 look	 old	 enough	 to	 be	 a doctor,”	he	barked	as	he	swung	his	legs	back	up	on	to	the	bed,	putting	his	hands</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind	his	head,	ignoring	the	doctor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	listen,	if	you	don’t	want	me	to	take	a	look	at	that	cut	on	your	head,	fine</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	me.	I’m	just	doing	my	job.”	He	made	to	leave,	turning	his	back	on	Will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	kid	yourself,	yah.	You’re	as	bad	as	the	rest	of	them.	First	you	beat	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">crap	out	of	me,	and	now	you	want	to	fix	me	up?	What	kind	of	hospital	is	this? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don’t	tell	me,	you	were	just	‘following	orders’,”	he	mocked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whoa	there,	mister.	I’m	one	of	the	good	guys.	Don’t	lump	me	in	with	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	lot.	Those	new	guys	are	off	their	rockers.	Nut	jobs.	I’ve	been	here	since	the beginning,	before	those	guys	took	over.	We	could	have	got	out,	they	gave	us	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">chance,	but	we	chose	to	stay.	They	made	this	place	secure	and	for	that	they	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	gratitude.	For	the	record,	that	doesn’t	mean	I	like	what	they	do	or	how	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	 shrugged	 his	 shoulders	 and	 looked	 back,	 unrepentant.	 The	 young	 man</p>
<p class="calibre1">dumped	his	bag	on	the	floor,	strode	over	to	the	chair	and	unrolled	the	tools	of	his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>trade	 on	 the	 bedside	 cabinet.	 The	 surgical	 kit	 contained	 scalpels,	 scissors,	 and what	 looked	 like	 a	 sewing	 kit	 with	 syringes	 all	 neatly	 secured	 in	 their	 Velcro holders	 and	 fabric	 loops.	 Will	 eyed	 the	 scalpel	 and	 imagined	 the	 damage	 he would	do	to	his	torturers	if	he	got	the	chance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	 inclined	 his	 head	 submissively	 towards	 the	 doctor.	 He	 ripped	 off	 the gauze	 and	 tape	 without	 warning,	 ignoring	 the	 patient’s	 howls	 of	 protest.	 He leaned	 in	 close	 to	 get	 a	 proper	 look,	 peering	 through	 the	 glasses	 at	 the	 nasty-looking	cut	behind	Will’s	left	ear.	Some	heavy	bruising	surrounded	the	wound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	donned	a	pair	of	disposable	surgical	gloves	and	gently	pressed	either	side	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	long	gash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	you’ll	definitely	need	stitches.	How	did	you	get	this,	dare	I	ask?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	 of	 your	 boys	 hit	 me	 from	 behind.	 Won’t	 forget	 him	 in	 a	 hurry.	 The others	called	him	‘Copper’.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.	I	know	who	you’re	talking	about.	Friendly	chap.	Like	I	said,	I	don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">condone	 violence.	 I	 just	 get	 to	 patch	 people	 up.	 More	 work	 for	 me,	 you	 might say.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	 winced	 as	 the	 doctor	 worked,	 gasping	 a	 couple	 of	 times	 when	 gloved fingers	pressed	too	hard.	For	a	big	hardy	builder,	who	had	been	a	labourer	all	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">life,	he	hated	needles	and	blood.	At	school,	he	was	forever	the	boy	who	fainted</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 playground	 after	 slicing	 his	 shin	 open	 on	 a	 rusted	 nail.	 He’d	 been balancing	 on	 a	 wooden	 plank	 when	 he	 slipped	 and	 fell.	 His	 classmates	 knew better	 than	 to	 make	 fun	 of	 him.	 Will	 had	 always	 been	 just	 a	 little	 taller	 and heavier-set	growing	up	which	made	others	fear	him.	His	physique	and	imposing</p>
<p class="calibre1">presence	had	made	him	a	promising	rugby	player	until	he	clean	broke	his	wrist</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	he	was	barely	twelve	and	never	played	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking	 down	 at	 his	 feet,	 Will	 mumbled	 into	 his	 chest,	 his	 voice	 sounding awkward	 and	 strained.	 “You’re	 Indian,	 right?	 Never	 been	 treated	 by	 an	 Indian doctor	before.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 you	 clearly	 haven’t	 lived	 long	 in	 this	 country	 then.	 My	 father	 was	 a dentist,	my	brother	a	surgeon,	my	sister	a	paediatrician.	You	could	say	it	runs	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	family.	Anyway,	I’m	British,	born	and	bred.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fair	enough.	I	don’t	have	a	problem	with	it.	I	was	just	making	conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	what	do	you	know	about	this	virus?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 asking	 the	 wrong	 person,	 I’m	 afraid.	 I	 mostly	 get	 to	 look	 after	 old people	here.	Routine	stuff	really.	Dementia,	Alzheimer’s,	Parkinson’s,	palliative</p>
<p class="calibre1">care.	Don’t	get	to	see	many	killer	viruses	or	tropical	diseases	on	the	south	coast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Big	city	hospitals	get	the	high-profile	cases.	Ebola,	malaria.	Shame	really.	Might</p>
<p class="calibre1">spice	things	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be	careful	what	you	wish	for.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>“My	 knowledge	 of	 viruses	 is	 really	 dated,	 goes	 back	 to	 medical	 school	 and stuff	I	picked	up	from	the	press	and	journals	they	had	in	the	staffroom.	I	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">bits	and	pieces,	but	nothing	of	any	use.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	as	a	doctor,	you	must	have	some	idea	what	we’re	dealing	with.	What	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	had	to	make	an	educated	guess?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 pondered	 the	 question	 thoughtfully	 and	 then	 launched	 in	 to	 his	 answer with	 growing	 confidence.	 “Well,	 it	 sounds	 a	 lot	 like	 the	 Spanish	 flu	 pandemic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	outbreak	after	the	First	World	War	killed	millions,	more	than	the	war	itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 the	 Millennial	 Virus	 is	 more	 deadly	 and	 spreads	 quicker.	 Of	 course,	 cheap airline	travel	and	tourism	probably	accelerated	all	that.	Based	on	the	patients	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw	and	treated,	I’d	say	around	one	in	ten	people	have	some	degree	of	immunity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	were	worse	affected	than	others,	but	most	died	within	three	to	five	days, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 very	 few	 got	 better.	 We	 threw	 everything	 we	 had	 at	 it.	 We	 did	 little	 more than	 prolong	 their	 agony	 for	 a	 few	 hours	 or	 days.	 The	 outcome	 was	 almost always	the	same.	It’s	a	very	effective	killer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	sounds	like	you	admire	the	virus?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	you?	Mother	Nature	has	been	perfecting	the	flu	virus	over	millions	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">years	and	it	looks	like	she’s	cracked	the	code	this	time.	Of	course,	if	the	CDC, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 know,	 the	 Centre	 for	 Disease	 Control	 in	 the	 States,	 or	 the	 World	 Health Organization	 are	 still	 functional,	 then	 they	 may	 have	 developed	 a	 vaccine.	 By now	you	might	expect	them	to	have	inoculated	health	workers	and	the	military. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Right	now	they	may	well	be	mounting	a	rescue	mission	to	save	us	‘Brits’.	Who</p>
<p class="calibre1">knows?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	could	it	be	done	if	they	have	the	right	resources?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure.	We	already	have	a	lab	here	with	all	the	kit.	If	you	got	hold	of	samples</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 virus,	 an	 electron-microscope,	 biohazard	 suits,	 air	 purifiers,	 then	 no question,	we	could	keep	trying	till	we	found	something	that	worked.	Might	take</p>
<p class="calibre1">decades	though.	All	we’d	need	would	be	an	army	of	scientists,	unlimited	money</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 resources.	 Hey,	 throw	 in	 someone	 with	 immunity,	 patient	 zero…while</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re	at	it,	perhaps	find	me	Elvis	and	Lord	Lucan.	But	take	a	look	around	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’re	mostly	working	in	the	dark	ages	here.	We	barely	have	enough	power	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	emergency	generator	to	keep	the	lights	on,	let	alone	anything	discretionary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	have	a	skeletal	team,	and	the	man	in	charge	is	a	psychopath,	but	apart	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">that,	we	have	everything	we	need.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	young	doctor	finished	up	the	stitches	behind	Will’s	ear	and	patted	him	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	head	like	a	dog.	“There	you	go.	Good	as	new.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you.	I	owe	you	one.	What’s	your	name?”	asked	Will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	doctor	smiled.	“Doctor	Ganesh,	but	you	can	call	me	Raj.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	Raj,	if	I	figure	out	how	to	get	out	of	this	hellhole,	I’ll	come	and	find</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 doctor	 packed	 up	 the	 plastic	 case	 with	 the	 syringe,	 scissors,	 bandages and	other	assorted	items,	paused	at	the	door	to	say	something	and	thought	better</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 it.	 He	 knocked	 twice	 and	 heard	 the	 guard	 jangle	 his	 keys.	 The	 rotund	 guard opened	the	door	just	wide	enough	to	let	him	pass.	Will	sat	on	the	side	of	the	bed</p>
<p class="calibre1">smiling,	opening	and	closing	his	fingers	in	a	childlike	goodbye.	The	guard	curled</p>

<p class="calibre1">every	 rooftop	 around	 the	 camp	 were	 close	 to	 empty.	 Nathan	 walked	 everyone through	 the	 rotas	 for	 night	 watches	 and	 scavenging	 duties	 for	 the	 following week. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 other	 heads	 of	 department	 took	 it	 in	 turns	 to	 give	 their	 own	 quick updates,	 going	 round	 the	 table,	 sharing	 their	 questions	 and	 concerns	 before Nathan	handed	things	back	to	Terra. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 leaned	 forward,	 blinking	 rapidly	 as	 she	 tried	 to	 organise	 her	 thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each	 of	 the	 council	 members	 were	 loyal	 and	 true,	 hand-chosen	 by	 her	 or	 Jack, selected	 as	 much	 for	 their	 competence	 as	 for	 their	 alternative	 viewpoints, unafraid	to	challenge	when	opinions	differed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	is	one	other	matter	I	need	to	raise,”	she	began.	“Last	night,	the	door	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	food	store	was	forced	and	a	number	of	items	taken.”	There	was	a	small	gasp</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	two	women	at	the	far	end.	“The	inventory	we	took	last	week	confirms</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	we	are	missing	the	following…”	Nathan	passed	her	the	yellow	pad	and	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">fumbled	 with	 the	 spectacles	 that	 hung	 around	 her	 neck.	 She	 peered	 down	 past her	nose,	running	her	finger	along	the	listed	items:	“two	packets	of	biscuits,	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">bar	of	chocolate,	three	bags	of	crisps	and	one	tin	each	of	pineapple	and	tuna.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 two	 women	 at	 the	 far	 end	 exchanged	 glances	 and	 one	 of	 them,	 Liz, </p>
<p class="calibre1">mumbled	something	Terra	didn’t	catch.	It	was	Liz	who	ran	the	kitchen	and	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>more	than	a	little	protective	of	the	meagre	stores	and	ingredients	her	team	had	at their	disposal.	Perhaps	she	had	her	suspicions	already.	There	were	several	likely</p>
<p class="calibre1">suspects;	new	arrivals	who	had	not	yet	earned	Terra’s	trust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz	leaned	forward	and	whispered	conspiratorially	with	the	woman	to	her	left</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	flowing	blonde	hair	that	reached	down	to	her	shoulders,	which	she	wore	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">plaits.	 Terra	 guessed	 Greta	 was	 around	 thirty.	 She	 spoke	 with	 only	 a	 hint	 of	 a Swedish	accent	in	otherwise	flawless	English.	Her	short	unsuccessful	stint	as	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">trainee	detective	in	Gothenburg	had	earned	her	the	position	as	keeper	of	keys	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hurst.	 That	 made	 investigating	 the	 theft	 her	 responsibility,	 but	 she	 looked affronted	 that	 Terra	 had	 not	 spoken	 to	 her	 first	 before	 speaking	 to	 the	 council. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let	them	sweat	for	a	while,	Terra	thought,	smiling	to	herself.	She	ignored	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">private	discussion	and	continued	undeterred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	you	all	know,	theft	is	a	very	serious	offence	and	one	that	must	carry	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">most	severe	penalty.	I	want	the	whole	place	searched.	Leave	no	stone	unturned</p>
<p class="calibre1">until	these	items	are	found	and	the	culprit	apprehended.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	I	ask	why	I	was	not	consulted	first,	Terra?”	asked	Liz	indignantly.	“Last</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	I	checked,	the	kitchen	and	stores	were	my	responsibility.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	isn’t	the	first	time	food	has	gone	missing,	is	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz	blushed,	her	eyes	narrowed	at	this	veiled	slur,	but	she	knew	better	than	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">push	 Terra	 too	 far,	 taking	 a	 moment	 to	 compose	 herself.	 “And	 what	 do	 you intend	to	do	with	them	when	you	find	them?”	she	asked	instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terra	deflected	the	question	to	Nathan.	“The	rules	are	clear.	Punishment	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">theft	is	banishment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz	 stared	 back	 at	 Greta	 and	 then	 Nathan.	 “I	 agree,	 but,	 Terra,	 banishment means	almost	certain	death	for	the	perpetrator.	Should	the	council	not	be	granted</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	opportunity	to	vote	once	the	party	responsible	is	discovered?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz’s	 tilted	 head	 reminded	 Terra	 momentarily	 of	 Bella,	 her	 old	 Labrador. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	she	missed	the	dog	she	had	raised	from	a	puppy.	Bella	had	been	at	the	vet</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	an	overnight	stay	when	Terra	got	caught	up	in	the	evacuation.	She	spent	three</p>
<p class="calibre1">hours	stuck	in	a	line	of	traffic	that	crawled	to	a	halt	and	then	never	moved	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 wondered	 whether	 someone	 had	 let	 Bella	 out	 of	 that	 kennel.	 Best	 not	 to think	 about	 it.	 Lock	 it	 away	 with	 all	 the	 other	 unpleasant	 memories	 from	 that time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz	went	on,	undeterred	by	Terra’s	vacant	expression.	“There	is	a	precedent</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	 all.	 Remember	 that	 guy	 from	 Bournemouth?	 Robbie.	 The	 one	 who	 hit</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 with	 the	 piece	 of	 driftwood.	 Needed	 nine	 stitches.	 Jack	 didn’t	 banish him,	he	just	locked	him	up	for	three	days,	taught	him	a	lesson.	It	was	all	handled</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 a	 handshake	 and	 an	 apology.	 So	 why	 do	 you	 think	 theft	 warrants</p>
<p class="calibre1">banishment?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>Nathan	cleared	his	throat.	“It’s	the	code,	that’s	why.	The	code	exists	for	this very	purpose.	It	is	written.	It	is	known	and	public.	All	those	who	choose	to	stay</p>
<p class="calibre1">within	these	walls	and	accept	the	sanctuary	and	security	this	community	offers, </p>
<p class="calibre1">agree	 to	 abide	 by	 the	 code.	 There	 can	 be	 no	 order	 without	 the	 code.	 Surely,	 as council	members,	we	all	understand	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	heads	turned	towards	Cedric,	or	Scottie	as	he	was	affectionately	known, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 he	 roared	 with	 laughter,	 banging	 his	 coffee	 mug	 on	 the	 table	 with	 some theatricality.	 He	 had	 been	 silent	 to	 this	 point,	 listening	 absent-mindedly	 with	 a smile	spreading	across	his	face.	He	shook	his	head.	“Your	petty	bureaucracy	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">laughable.	 People	 out	 there	 are	 dying	 by	 the	 thousands.	 Law	 and	 order	 have failed.	 Gangs	 roam	 the	 towns	 raping	 and	 murdering	 while	 we	 sit	 here	 arguing about	stolen	biscuits.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terra	gripped	her	armrest	a	little	tighter.	This	wasn’t	the	first	time	Scottie	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">undermined	 her	 authority.	 After	 a	 life	 on	 the	 stage,	 he	 was	 a	 consummate performer,	 intent	 on	 grabbing	 the	 limelight.	 It	 was	 said	 he	 had	 cut	 his	 teeth	 in Scotland’s	 smallest	 and	 pokiest	 theatres,	 treading	 the	 boards	 to	 a	 handful	 of spectators	 before	 getting	 his	 big	 break.	 Signed	 to	 play	 Macduff	 in	 a	 Royal Shakespeare	Company	production	of	 <i class="calibre4">Macbeth</i>	in	a	nationwide	tour	that	finished in	Southampton,	he	had	fallen	madly	in	love	with	a	local	girl	who	worked	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">foyer	at	the	Mayflower	Theatre	and	never	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Scottie,”	interrupted	Terra,	“we	have	survived	this	far	because	of	the	code. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	law,	there	is	chaos.	The	code	is	what	binds	us	together.	Without	it	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	anarchy.	Is	that	what	you	prefer?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	 course	 not,	 but	 we	 are	 a	 civilised	 society,	 are	 we	 not?	 Context	 must	 be considered	 before	 sentence	 is	 passed.	 When	 all	 the	 facts	 are	 known	 should	 the matter	 not	 come	 before	 the	 council	 again?	 Whoever	 said	 that	 the	 code	 was absolute?	 It	 should	 be	 a	 guide,	 to	 be	 interpreted,	 with	 flexibility	 if	 needed.	 If extenuating	circumstances	exist,	then	some	degree	of	leniency	is	called	for.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 must	 make	 an	 example	 of	 whoever	 did	 this.	 The	 council	 demands	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Punishment	is	due.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nathan’s	intransigence	provoked	another	melodramatic	outburst	from	Scottie, </p>
<p class="calibre1">throwing	his	hands	up	in	despair.	He	pushed	back	his	chair	and	stood	up,	pacing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 room	 in	 frustration.	 “I’m	 warning	 you.	 This	 will	 not	 play	 well	 with	 the people.	Justice	must	be	seen	to	be	done.	I	put	it	to	the	vote	that	once	the	culprit	is discovered,	we	assemble	a	court	and	a	fair	verdict	reached	by	a	jury	of	peers	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">equals.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terra	 considered	 the	 request	 and	 glanced	 at	 Nathan	 and	 the	 others	 sitting around	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very	 well.	 Those	 in	 favour	 of	 holding	 a	 trial	 raise	 your	 hands.”	 Terra</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>counted	 the	 hands	 just	 to	 be	 one	 hundred	 per	 cent	 certain.	 “Motioned	 carried.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 shrugged.	 “So	 be	 it.	 Greta,	 I’ll	 leave	 it	 to	 you	 to	 find	 the	 individual	 or individuals	responsible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Sixteen</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	helped	Simon	grab	the	last	of	the	cardboard	boxes	stacked	on	the	roof	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	boat’s	small	cabin.	Keeping	one	foot	planted	on	the	wide	wooden	slats	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pontoon,	 Simon	 raised	 his	 leg	 awkwardly	 as	 if	 he	 were	 practising	 t’ai	 chi,	 but without	the	grace	or	balance,	tottering	ungainly	as	the	boat	lurched	towards	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	straddled	the	guardrail	and	reached	for	the	box. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Toby	 stood	 silently	 with	 his	 back	 to	 his	 father,	 hands	 thrust	 deep	 in	 the pockets	 of	 his	 blue	 shorts.	 He	 was	 watching	 red	 mullet	 swim	 lazily	 around	 the polystyrene	 float	 of	 the	 jetty.	 The	 mullet	 sucked	 greedily	 at	 the	 seaweed	 that clung	 to	 the	 boat’s	 rudder.	 The	 brass	 propeller	 glinted	 invitingly,	 reflecting	 the beams	of	sunlight	that	danced	in	the	flowing	tide,	a	few	feet	below	the	surface. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Lady	Lucy	III</i>	was	stencilled	in	large	green	letters	on	the	stern	of	the	thirty-two-foot	Contessa	yacht,	her	home	port	of	“Falmouth”	written	underneath	in	italics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chipped	 and	 weather-worn,	 there	 was	 an	 incongruous	 graphic	 of	 a	 bath-time duck,	faded	as	it	was	by	sun	and	seawater,	smiling	bashfully,	waddling	through	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cartoon	puddle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 main	 halyard	 that	 stretched	 from	 the	 top	 of	 the	 mast	 tapped	 out	 a	 light rhythm	 in	 the	 morning	 breeze.	 Small	 waves	 lapped	 against	  <i class="calibre4">Lady	 Lucy</i>’s	 hull, sending	 ripples	 radiating	 outwards.	 Toby	 watched	 as	 a	 long	 tail	 of	 seaweed tethered	to	the	jetty	float	swam	back	and	forth	in	the	tidal	flow.	From	the	engine</p>
<p class="calibre1">outlet,	 a	 thin	 slick	 of	 oil	 spawned	 multicoloured	 shapes	 and	 patterns	 on	 the surface	of	the	water.	A	large	bubble	span,	skating	against	the	tide	in	the	breeze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon	 passed	 Tommy	 the	 box	 containing	 the	 last	 of	 their	 tinned	 food,	 rice and	 pasta	 over	 the	 guardrail.	 Stepping	 back	 down	 on	 to	 the	 jetty,  <i class="calibre4">Lady	 Lucy</i> rolled	back	into	equilibrium,	its	fenders	and	warps	groaning	their	farewell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,	Toby,”	Simon	called	over	his	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Toby	 lifted	 his	 head,	 looked	 out	 across	 the	 salt	 marshes	 towards	 Keyhaven, kicked	a	small	pebble	into	the	water	and	ran	after	his	dad.	He	fell	into	step,	part supporting	the	weight	of	the	box.	Toby	looked	up	wide-eyed,	searching	out	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">father’s	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 walked	 over	 a	 small	 wooden	 slatted	 bridge	 that	 spanned	 what	 would</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 been	 the	 original	 moat	 of	 the	 castle,	 now	 bone	 dry	 and	 no	 more	 than	 a grassy	ditch.	Above	the	rounded	arch	gateway	was	a	large	royal	crest	painted	red</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>with	 the	 monarch’s	 coat	 of	 arms	 and	 “V.R.	 1873”	 in	 gold	 letters	 underneath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Toby	paused	to	wonder	what	the	initials	stood	for	before	skipping	after	Tommy</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 his	 father.	 An	 old-fashioned	 lantern	 in	 black	 gunmetal	 swung	 over	 the entrance.	 Toby	 tiptoed	 precariously	 along	 the	 narrow-gauge	 railway	 tracks	 that ran	 straight	 through	 the	 tunnel	 and	 into	 the	 courtyard	 beyond.	 They	 passed	 the guardhouse	 on	 the	 right-hand	 side,	 formerly	 a	 gift	 shop	 where	 visitors	 to	 the castle	bought	their	entrance	tickets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz	was	waiting	for	them	in	the	storeroom.	She	examined	each	item,	calling</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	its	contents	to	be	noted	in	their	inventory,	sorting	the	tins	and	pasta	onto	one of	the	long	trestle	tables	stacked	high	with	supplies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Horse	 chestnuts?”	 said	 Tommy,	 picking	 up	 one	 of	 the	 more	 exotic-looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">tins	and	reading	the	English	translation	on	what	looked	like	a	Thai	label.	“Been	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">while	 since	 we	 had	 foreign	 food	 eh?	 Can’t	 say	 I’m	 a	 fan,	 always	 gives	 me	 the runs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	 listen	 to	 him,”	 said	 Liz,	 snatching	 the	 tin	 from	 Tommy	 and	 nudging him	out	of	the	way	with	her	shoulder.	“What	would	you	know?	No	taste,	you	lot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	wouldn’t	know	haute	cuisine	if	it	bit	you	on	the	nose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	whole	ocean	of	fish	right	on	our	doorstep.	But	we	eat	what	we’re	given, </p>
<p class="calibre1">ain’t	that	right,	Liz?	Give	me	a	nice	piece	of	haddock	any	day	of	the	week.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	you	remember	it,”	she	responded	defiantly,	turning	over	the	next	tin	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 short	 stubby	 fingers.	 “Baby	 carrots,”	 she	 called	 out	 to	 Connie,	 one	 of	 the teenagers	who	helped	her	in	the	kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon	and	Toby	watched	their	exchanges	in	mild	amusement,	looking	around</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 canteen.	 It	 was	 basic	 but	 functional.	 Liz	 knelt	 down	 so	 her	 face	 was	 level with	Toby’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	bet	you	didn’t	know	that	a	small	garrison	of	soldiers	lived	here	during	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">war.	 They	 were	 responsible	 for	 guarding	 the	 Solent	 against	 attacks	 by	 German U-boats	or	motor	torpedo	boats.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Toby	listened,	enthralled	as	Liz	told	him	more	about	the	history	of	the	castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,	I’ll	show	you	the	old	theatre,”	said	Tommy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz	called	out	after	them:	“Thanks	for	the	Thai	goodies.	I’ll	have	a	think	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	can	make	with	chestnuts.	Perhaps	we’ll	have	a	curry	then	tonight,	Connie.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	gave	them	a	walking	tour	of	the	castle,	pointing	out	the	dining	hall, </p>
<p class="calibre1">library,	 and	 the	 small	 shared	 dormitory	 where	 they	 could	 sleep	 tonight.	 He introduced	them	to	various	people	as	they	went. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 stopped	 at	 the	 theatre	 and	 Tommy	 explained	 all	 about	 their	 busy</p>
<p class="calibre1">schedule	 of	 upcoming	 shows.	 Scottie’s	 performances	 ranged	 from	 recitals	 of Shakespearean	 soliloquies,	 sonnets	 and	 longer	 passages	 he	 performed	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1">memory.	He	was	somewhat	of	a	Hurst	treasure,	greeted	with	a	mixture	of	mild</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>amusement	from	the	young,	and	muted	rapture	from	the	more	senior	members	of the	group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Standing	next	to	the	stage,	Tommy	passed	Toby	an	inflatable	parrot	they	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">using	as	a	prop.	“They’re	just	auditioning	for	parts	in	 <i class="calibre4">Treasure	Island</i>,	if	you’re interested	 in	 having	 a	 go.	 You’d	 make	 a	 great	 Jim	 Hawkins.	 I	 wanted	 to	 be	 a pirate	but	they	won’t	let	me	have	a	speaking	part.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon	 ruffled	 Toby’s	 hair.	 The	 boy	 looked	 suitably	 embarrassed	 at	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">unwanted	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Scottie	 adapted	 the	 script	 from	 the	 original	 book.	 Riley	 found	 him	 a	 copy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	should	have	seen	the	look	in	his	eyes	when	he	was	presented	with	this	dusty</p>
<p class="calibre1">old	copy.	Clutched	it	to	his	chest	like	it	was	treasure	itself.	To	think	a	book	could have	 that	 kind	 of	 effect	 on	 a	 grown	 man,”	 mocked	 Tommy,	 shaking	 his	 head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	 something	 of	 an	 acquired	 taste,	 I	 suppose.	 He	 never	 fails	 to	 draw	 a crowd.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 truth,	 Scottie	 revelled	 in	 his	 role	 as	 Hurst’s	 resident	 entertainer.	 Most evenings	 he	 organised	 public	 readings	 from	 well-known	 works.	 A	 genius	 with voices,	 accents	 and	 bringing	 the	 words	 on	 the	 page	 to	 life	 in	 a	 way	 that captivated	 young	 and	 old.  <i class="calibre4">Charlie	 and	 the	 Chocolate	 Factory</i>	 for	 the	 youngest children	before	bedtime,  <i class="calibre4">Harry	Potter</i>	 for	 the	 teens,	 and	 even	 the	 adults	 would sit	enthralled	by	readings	from	Dickens,	Hardy	or	Hemmingway.	He	was	forever</p>
<p class="calibre1">nagging	the	scavenging	parties	to	find	them	more	books.	Books,	books,	books, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 if	 that	 was	 more	 important	 than	 food.	 Riley	 dutifully	 obliged	 and	 usually brought	home	a	paperback	or	two.	Occasionally	she	found	a	first	edition	or	rare</p>
<p class="calibre1">tome	 that	 had	 Scottie	 stroking	 its	 cover,	 enthralled	 by	 dedications	 or	 author signatures.	He	was	something	of	a	collector. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	 just	 sounded	 a	 little	 bit	 better	 when	 Scottie	 read	 it.	 He	 added	 a vocal	 range	 and	 dramatic	 delivery	 to	 even	 the	 most	 boring	 of	 roll	 calls	 and memos.	He	had	a	knack	of	making	anything	sound	more	interesting.	It	reminded</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	of	how	TV	commercials	used	to	get	well-known	Hollywood	actors	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">Michael	Douglas	or	Harvey	Keitel	to	do	voice-overs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 walked	 them	 back	 outside	 to	 the	 courtyard,	 pointing	 to	 a	 large</p>
<p class="calibre1">whitewashed	section	of	the	castle	wall	where	he	told	them	they	projected	feature</p>
<p class="calibre1">films	for	“Movie	Night”	every	third	Friday	in	the	month.	It	made	for	one	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	 popular	 and	 social	 evenings	 at	 Hurst.	 He	 remembered	 one	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">scavenging	 teams	 bringing	 back	 an	 old-fashioned	 reel	 projector	 and	 two	 boxes of	 8mm	 films	 they’d	 found	 while	 searching	 the	 attic	 of	 a	 house	 owned	 by	 a movie	fanatic	or	someone	working	in	the	business.	They	told	how	the	house	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	cluttered	with	film	props	and	memorabilia,	photos	of	movie	stars,	past	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">present. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>It	 was	 the	 same	 with	 the	 Hurst	 museum.	 Scottie	 made	 a	 habit	 of	 collecting similar	 trophies	 recovered	 from	 the	 local	 area.	 From	 paintings	 and	 books	 to statues	 and	 even	 larger	 antiques,	 he	 considered	 it	 their	 duty	 to	 salvage	 art	 and preserve	 it	 for	 future	 generations.	 The	 walls	 of	 the	 museum	 were	 now	 adorned with	 old	 masters,	 a	 Constable	 together	 with	 several	 impressionist	 works	 from Cezanne,	Monet	and	a	Pissarro.	They	even	had	a	piece	by	Damien	Hirst,	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">divided	opinion,	but	Scottie	loved	it	all	the	same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	movies	they	showed	on	those	special	evenings	were	mostly	classic	war</p>
<p class="calibre1">films	 and	 Westerns.	 There	 was	 nothing	 more	 modern	 in	 the	 collection,	 but	 it didn’t	 seem	 to	 matter.	 They	 would	 sit	 outside	 on	 milder	 spring	 or	 summer evenings	 under	 the	 stars.	 Lying	 on	 picnic	 blankets	 or	 deckchairs	 late	 into	 the night,	 Scottie	 would	 operate	 the	 projector,	 changing	 reels	 to	 the	 groans	 of audiences.	 The	 changes	 always	 seemed	 to	 come	 at	 a	 particularly	 gripping</p>
<p class="calibre1">cliffhanger	 moment,	 scrambling	 around	 to	 locate	 and	 mount	 the	 next	 reel.	 His regulars	 would	 never	 tire	 of	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Magnificent	 Seven</i>	 or	  <i class="calibre4">The	 Guns	 of	 Navarone</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 knew	 every	 scene,	 every	 line,	 every	 word.	 He	 annoyed	 the	 hell	 out	 of whoever	he	sat	next	to	by	mouthing	the	words	and	telling	people	his	favourite	bit</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	just	coming	up. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The	 room	 was	 silent	 other	 than	 the	 sound	 of	 the	 ink	 pen	 scratching	 on	 the yellow	 pad	 and	 Nathan’s	 shallow,	 efficient	 breaths.	 Terra	 noticed	 his	 tongue peeping	out	furtively	between	his	lips	as	he	concentrated	on	the	task	at	hand.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 still	 troubled	 by	 the	 question	 of	 the	 missing	 food	 and	 curious	 about	 the council’s	 response.	 She	 didn’t	 trust	 Liz,	 but	 it	 seemed	 unlikely	 that	 she	 was implicated	in	any	way.	Sloppy	and	careless	perhaps,	but	she	wasn’t	dishonest.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">took	 a	 liar	 to	 spot	 another.	 Liz	 didn’t	 have	 the	 brains	 or	 the	 imagination	 for	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Certainly	no	match	for	Terra.	Riley	on	the	other	hand…	She	didn’t	trust	her	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	as	far	as	she	could	throw	them,	which	was	why	she	had	one	of	her	people</p>
<p class="calibre1">watching	them	and	reporting	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside,	the	early	evening	rain	had	eased	and	grey	clouds	were	being	chased</p>
<p class="calibre1">away,	 replaced	 by	 clearer	 skies	 and	 the	 faint	 streak	 of	 a	 rainbow	 in	 the	 dying light	of	the	setting	sun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nathan	collected	the	papers,	pulling	the	heavy	oak	door	closed	behind	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	a	metallic	clank	as	the	locking	mechanism	engaged.	They	slowly	descended</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	uneven	stone	steps,	treading	carefully	to	avoid	grooves	dug	over	hundreds	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">years,	where	heavy	crates	had	been	dragged	to	the	courtyard	below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	 children	 raced	 up	 the	 stairs	 past	 them.	 The	 first	 nearly	 barged	 into Nathan.	The	second	one	feinted	left	then	right	before	squirming	past,	head	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nathan	grabbed	the	lopsided	pile	of	papers	before	they	could	slip	from	his	grasp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terra	stopped	and	watched	the	children	go	with	a	wry	smile,	shaking	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	froze	mid-step,	and	they	both	looked	up	at	the	sky.	Echoing	off	the	walls</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	a	familiar	rhythmic	hum	that	made	them	stare	at	each	other.	It	was	a	sound</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 had	 not	 heard	 for	 many	 months.	 A	 helicopter.	 But	 that	 seemed	 totally incongruous,	implausible	even	after	all	this	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 hurried	 down	 to	 the	 courtyard,	 looking	 in	 every	 direction,	 trying	 to place	the	sound	that	echoed	off	the	old	brick	and	stone.	The	metallic	throbbing</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>got	a	fleeting	glimpse	only	as	it	swept	over	the	castle	and	banked	round,	making several	passes,	perhaps	scanning	for	movement	and	a	place	to	land	below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dozens	 of	 people	 dropped	 whatever	 they	 were	 doing	 and	 headed	 out	 of	 the main	 gate,	 some	 still	 holding	 tools.	 In	 a	 few	 short	 seconds,	 the	 whole	 of	 Hurst had	 emptied	 out	 on	 to	 the	 flat	 grassy	 area	 outside	 the	 main	 walls	 and	 stood staring	up	into	the	dying	light.	A	young	girl	was	pointing	up	to	the	evening	sky, </p>
<p class="calibre1">following	 the	 movement	 of	 the	 helicopter	 with	 her	 finger.	 Its	 red	 navigation lights	started	blinking	on	and	off	as	it	circled	the	castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terra	didn’t	recognise	the	make	of	helicopter	at	first.	It	was	long	and	angular, </p>
<p class="calibre1">stealthy	and	graceful	at	the	same	time.	Bit	like	a	Lynx.	But	definitely	not	like	the more	portly	Sea	Kings	she	had	grown	used	to	seeing	on	rare	occasions	shuttling</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	and	out	of	the	Royal	Navy	base	at	Portsmouth.	It	was	shark-like,	powerful	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">menacing.	She	had	never	seen	one	like	this	in	real	life,	but	had	watched	enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">war	 movies	 and	 the	 like	 to	 know	 that	 this	 must	 be	 a	 Blackhawk	 or	 something very	similar,	which	meant	only	one	thing:	it	had	to	be	American. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nathan	 shouted	 something	 she	 didn’t	 catch.	 He	 paced	 over	 and	 shouted</p>
<p class="calibre1">again,	 directly	 into	 her	 ear:	 “We	 shouldn’t	 take	 any	 chances.	 We	 should	 break out	the	weapons,	just	in	case.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terra	nodded	and	Nathan	ran	off	to	tell	the	guards	to	be	ready	for	anything. </p>

<p class="calibre1">illuminating	 the	 landing	 zone	 behind	 the	 gathering	 horde.	 It	 came	 into	 a	 hover over	the	flat	grassy	area,	sending	dust	and	loose	debris	swirling	in	all	directions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	crowd	that	had	assembled,	tightly	packed	together,	retreated	a	few	yards, </p>

<p class="calibre1">The	Seahawk	landed,	its	twin	engines	powering	down.	Its	rotor	blades	began</p>

<p class="calibre1">A	well-groomed	officer	in	military	fatigues	appeared	behind	them.	He	strode</p>
<p class="calibre1">confidently	 towards	 the	 group,	 pulling	 up	 around	 ten	 metres	 short,	 keeping	 his distance.	 He	 cupped	 one	 hand	 to	 the	 side	 of	 his	 mouth	 and	 shouted	 over	 the dying	engine	noise	to	make	himself	heard.	“Who’s	in	charge	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 voice	 was	 a	 little	 muffled	 by	 the	 surgical	 mask	 covering	 his	 nose	 and mouth.	There	was	a	slight	pause	as	eyes	turned	towards	Nathan	and	Terra.	The</p>

<p class="calibre1">Terra	gestured	towards	the	lighthouse.	“Yes,	of	course.	Follow	me.”	Nathan</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	American	turned	his	back	on	the	crowd,	relaying	commands	to	the	two</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>tightly	 into	 his	 ear,	 listening	 for	 their	 response.	 They	 took	 up	 position	 by	 the helicopter,	alert	to	any	danger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nathan	and	the	rest	of	the	Hurst	group	watched	Terra	and	the	officer	leave	in</p>

<p class="calibre1">Toby	 held	 his	 father’s	 hand	 tightly,	 trying	 to	 read	 his	 expression.	 It	 was	 a mixture	of	hope	and	excitement.	His	father	reassuringly	squeezed	his	hand,	but</p>

<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 windscreen	 that	 joined	 together	 in	 the	 buffeting	 wind	 to	 make	 tiny rivulets.	 A	 sudden	 rainsquall	 lashed	 against	 the	 glass,	 as	 the	 single	 wiper struggled	to	clear,	half	of	its	rubber	blade	missing.	It	did	little	better	than	smear the	glass	every	few	seconds	in	jerky	motions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	 made	 some	 tea	 for	 them	 and	 put	 some	 music	 on	 to	 lighten	 the	 mood. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Jack	 drained	 the	 last	 of	 the	 tea	 from	 his	 stained	 coffee	 cup.	 Its	 outside	 was decorated	with	a	faded	photo	of	his	six-year-old	godson	in	his	pyjamas.	The	tea</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 warm	 and	 wet,	 but	 tasted	 of	 nothing	 much	 as	 the	 bags	 had	 been	 used multiple	 times.	 The	 powdered	 milk	 was	 borderline	 revolting.	 Jack	 sighed	 and wondered	what	had	happened	to	his	godson	and	his	sister	Pauline.	Whether	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	any	chance	they	had	got	out	of	Winchester	in	time.	He	doubted	it.	There	was</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	  <i class="calibre4">Best	 of	 the	 Bee	 Gees</i>	 compilation	 moved	 on	 to	 “Staying	 Alive”.

<p class="calibre1">Jack	was	deep	in	thought,	shaken	by	what	he’d	seen	at	Spitbank.	He	refused</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 allow	 himself	 to	 pity,	 to	 mourn.	 To	 indulge	 the	 suffocating	 sense	 of	 sorrow and	despair	that	lurked	like	a	shadow	just	out	of	sight.	It	was	up	to	him	to	set	an example,	 wasn’t	 it?	 He	 couldn’t	 afford	 to	 show	 weakness	 or	 self-pity.	 He	 was their	rock.	They	looked	up	to	him.	He	wasn’t	a	religious	man,	but	it	made	him</p>

<p class="calibre1">His	private	anger	was	interrupted	by	a	question	from	Sam.	He	shook	his	head</p>

<p class="calibre1">Jack	glanced	at	Sam	and	noticed	tears	welling	in	his	eyes.	He	looked	out	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 sea	 towards	 Cowes,	 and	 Yarmouth	 beyond,	 taking	 a	 deep	 breath	 before</p>
<p class="calibre1">answering.	 “That’s	 up	 to	 us,	 Sam.	 That’s	 why	 we	 take	 precautions,	 right?	 We can't	 let	 it	 happen.	 The	 quarantine	 zone,	 the	 code,	 the	 rules	 we	 live	 by?	 We've fought	too	hard	to	make	it	this	far.	We	owe	it	to	ourselves	and	to	each	other	to</p>

<p class="calibre1">“But	 we	 can’t	 live	 like	 this	 forever,	 can	 we?	 How	 long	 before	 they	 come? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	someone	comes	to	rescue	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	makes	you	think	anyone’s	coming?”	Jack	replied	indignantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 it	 stands	 to	 reason	 that	 others	 must	 have	 survived.	 Did	 as	 we	 did.	 Not just	here,	but	everywhere.	Maybe	other	countries	weren’t	affected.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	 talked	 about	 this	 a	 hundred	 times	 though,	 haven’t	 we?	 If	 they	 were coming,	they’d	have	come	already.	Why	wait	till	now?	We’ve	watched	every	day</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 ships,	 listened	 to	 the	 radio.	 We	 shouldn’t	 give	 up	 hope,	 but	 chances	 are	 no one's	coming	to	rescue	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 regretted	 that	 last	 sentence,	 noticing	 Sam’s	 lip	 quiver	 as	 he	 fought	 back tears.	Who	knew?	After	all,	maybe	Sam	was	right? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	refuse	to	believe	that,”	said	Sam,	shaking	his	head.	“They	can’t	all	be	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	about	people	in	Africa	or	Australia?	Maybe	there	are	whole	countries	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">survived.	I	reckon	someone	somewhere	has	figured	this	all	out.	Found	the	cure</p>

<p class="calibre1">Jack	 nodded	 and	 smiled	 weakly.	 “That	 I	 don’t	 know,	 Sam.	 But	 we	 can’t</p>

<p class="calibre1">“But,	 it	 could	 be	 years,	 right?	 Or	 maybe	 they	 never	 come,	 what	 then?”	 His voice	sounded	brittle	again.	It	had	been	a	long	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	put	an	arm	around	his	shoulder,	looking	him	steadfastly	in	the	eye,	with</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>He	snatched	the	handset	from	its	cradle,	bolted	to	the	wall	at	head	height.	He depressed	the	receiver	to	speak:	“Jack	here.	Go	ahead,	Terra.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	far	out	are	you,	Jack?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	up?	Why	the	urgency?” </p>

<p class="calibre1">Well,	that’s	a	turn-up	for	the	books.	Wonder	where	he’s	come	from.	And	what	he</p>

<p class="calibre1">With	 the	 extra	 encouragement,	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>	 surged	 powerfully	 through	 the waves	with	the	tide	now	behind	them,	sweeping	them	back	towards	Hurst. </p>

<p class="calibre1">pouches.	Underneath	was	what	looked	like	body	armour,	metal	plates	protecting</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 chest	 and	 abdomen.	 He	 reminded	 Tommy	 of	 an	 American	 footballer	 in	 all that	gear,	accentuating	his	size.	The	soldier	was	enormous,	several	inches	taller</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	Tommy,	who	himself	was	no	midget.	He	gulped	as	he	noticed	the	sleeves	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 shirt	 bulging	 with	 what	 Tommy	 imagined	 must	 be	 heavily	 tattooed	 biceps like	 Arnold	 Schwarzenegger.	 A	 proper	 corn-fed	 American	 redneck,	 he	 thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 laughed	 nervously,	 looking	 down	 at	 the	 soldier’s	 boots	 and	 back	 up	 at	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>face,	taking	in	his	size	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	something	about	the	soldier’s	attitude	and	unfriendliness	that	got</p>
<p class="calibre1">right	 up	 his	 nose.	 Weren’t	 they	 meant	 to	 be	 on	 the	 same	 side?	 He	 felt emboldened,	staring	in	to	the	mask,	trying	to	eyeball	the	guy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 soldier	 remained	 static,	 motionless,	 like	 one	 of	 the	 Queen's	 guards	 at Buckingham	Palace	facing	a	tourist.	He	repositioned	the	semi-automatic	weapon</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 little	 on	 his	 shoulder,	 glanced	 at	 his	 partner	 and	 made	 sure	 Tommy	 saw	 him check	the	safety	was	on.	He	flexed	his	trigger	finger	before	straightening	it	again and	resting	it	back	on	the	outside	of	the	trigger	guard.	Tommy	got	the	message</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	stepped	back,	his	arms	raised,	head	down	submissively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	 him	 there	 was	 a	 palpable	 sense	 of	 excitement,	 mixed	 with	 anxiety. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	so	many	questions	they	each	wanted	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scottie	was	the	first	to	break	the	silence.	“So	where	have	you	come	from?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	 the	 soldiers	 had	 time	 to	 answer,	 Scottie’s	 question	 was	 quickly</p>
<p class="calibre1">followed	by	a	flurry	of	others	as	they	each	gave	voice	to	their	hopes	and	fears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	did	you	get	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	there	more	of	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s	your	ship?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	here	to	save	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	many	survived?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 soldiers	 ignored	 their	 questions,	 but	 Scottie	 answered	 on	 their	 behalf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	cannae	say.	They’ve	been	told	not	to	speak	to	us.	Isn’t	it	obvious?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	we	were	all	on	the	same	side,”	said	Tommy	hopefully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Clearly	not,”	shouted	one	of	the	others,	frustrated	at	the	soldiers’	refusal	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">cooperate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	 just	 taking	 precautions.	 They	 dinnae	 know	 we’re	 not	 sick,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">conceded	Scottie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	the	States	didn’t	get	the	sickness	like	we	did,”	said	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scottie	 shouted	 back.	 “Naw,	 Sarah,	 I	 wish	 that	 were	 true.	 Don’t	 you</p>
<p class="calibre1">remember?	 It	 was	 everywhere.	 You	 must	 remember.	 Every	 major	 city</p>
<p class="calibre1">experienced	outbreaks.	New	York,	Washington,	Chicago,	Los	Angeles.	Everyone</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	everywhere.	There	was	nowhere	to	hide.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	why	would	they	come	if	they’re	not	here	to	save	us?	Perhaps	we’ve	got</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	 all	 the	 wrong	 way	 round.	 Maybe	 it’s	 them	 that	 need	 our	 help?”	 Tommy laughed	and	those	around	him	joined	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	a	very	good	question,”	repeated	Scottie.	“Why	are	they	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	distance,	they	could	hear	the	low	chugging	of	the	 <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>’s	engine	just before	 she	 rounded	 the	 headland	 and	 hove	 into	 view.	 Tommy	 ran	 down	 to	 the jetty	 and	 waited	 patiently	 to	 catch	 the	 bowline	 from	 Sam.	 Jack	 turned	 off	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>ignition,	grabbed	his	bag	and	stepped	ashore.	Tommy	fell	into	step	beside	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 they	 walked	 towards	 the	 lighthouse,	 he	 brought	 Jack	 up	 to	 speed	 on	 the events	thus	far	and	led	him	to	where	Terra	and	the	American	were	waiting	inside</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	lighthouse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	knocked	lightly	on	the	sun-blistered	wooden	door,	its	off-white	paint</p>
<p class="calibre1">peeling	 and	 flaking.	 They	 heard	 footsteps	 inside	 and	 the	 door	 opened	 wide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lieutenant	 Peterson	 was	 sitting	 upright	 and	 alert	 at	 the	 kitchen	 table,	 his	 face dimly	lit	by	a	single	kerosene	lamp.	He	held	a	steaming	cup	of	black	tea	in	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	like	one	of	Jack’s	camping	mugs	he	used	for	fishing	trips.	The	American</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	 to	 stand	 and	 his	 chair	 scraped	 back	 on	 the	 slate	 floor.	 He	 strode	 over	 to greet	 Jack,	 brushing	 past	 Terra	 who	 stood	 warming	 her	 back	 on	 the	 stove.	 The door	swung	closed	behind	him,	leaving	Tommy	out	in	the	cool	damp	evening	air</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	approaching	nightfall. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Twenty-one</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	crest	of	a	man-made	bank	overlooking	the	hospital,	Zed	and	Riley	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">lying	flat	on	their	fronts	on	the	grass.	Zed	scanned	the	outside	of	the	buildings</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	some	pocket-sized	Zeiss	binoculars.	They	were	both	watching	carefully</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	any	movement,	hidden	from	view	beside	a	small	coniferous	tree,	a	scattering</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	daffodils	at	its	base. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 had	 parked	 the	 Land	 Rover	 a	 discrete	 distance	 away	 in	 a	 quiet	 back street	and	walked	the	remaining	quarter	mile.	Keeping	to	the	shadows,	stealing</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	cover,	they	had	raced	across	open	ground	one	person	at	a	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	passed	the	binoculars	to	Riley	and	whispered,	“What	do	you	think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 took	 them,	 put	 the	 strap	 round	 her	 neck	 and	 slowly	 brushed	 aside	 the daffodils	with	her	free	arm	to	clear	her	field	of	view.	She	did	a	slow	sweep	of	the hospital	buildings,	lingering	a	couple	of	times	before	continuing	her	scan.	“You</p>
<p class="calibre1">already	know	what	I	think.”	There	was	an	edge	to	her	voice.	“I	told	you.	This	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	suicide	mission.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	not	leaving	Will	here,”	responded	Zed	tersely,	tired	of	Riley	second-</p>
<p class="calibre1">guessing	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shot	him	a	look	loaded	with	thinly	disguised	scorn.	“You’re	putting	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">entire	 group	 at	 risk,	 and	 for	 what?	 We	 don’t	 even	 know	 for	 sure	 he’s	 in	 there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	 want	 to	 know	 what	 I’m	 thinking?	 Is	 this	 a	 rescue	 mission	 or	 some	 weird macho	bullshit?	Because	that’s	what	it	feels	like.	Take	a	look	around	you.	Your</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	‘band	of	brothers’	doesn’t	stand	a	chance	against	these	guys.	They’re	better armed	and	there’s	probably	a	whole	army	of	them	down	there.	We	go	in,	there’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	strong	chance	we	don’t	come	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 swallowed	 hard,	 trying	 to	 master	 his	 emotions.	 He	 let	 out	 a	 deep	 sigh, shaking	 his	 head.	 “Riley,	 you’re	 not	 listening	 to	 me.	 We’re	 not	 going	 in	 guns blazing,	okay?	We	wait	till	it’s	nice	and	dark	and	creep	in	ninja-like	around	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	 where	 no	 one’s	 watching.	 We’ll	 be	 in	 and	 out	 again	 before	 anyone	 even realises	we	were	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	laughed	sarcastically,	but	the	look	in	her	eyes	was	deadly	serious.	“Zed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s	your	call.	I’m	not	going	to	argue	with	you	in	front	of	the	others.	But	I’m	just telling	you,	I	don’t	like	this.	It’s	risky.	And	it’s	not	too	late	to	change	your	mind and	turn	back.	No	one	will	think	less	of	you.	For	all	we	know,	Will	could	already</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>be	 dead	 or	 moved	 someplace	 else.	 It’s	 a	 big	 call.	 What	 if	 more	 of	 us	 get captured,	or	one	of	those	psychos	decides	to	start	shooting?	What	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 looked	 down	 for	 a	 second,	 clenching	 his	 fist,	 bristling	 at	 Riley's</p>
<p class="calibre1">condescension.	 He	 tore	 out	 a	 handful	 of	 grass	 and	 held	 the	 blades	 up	 to	 his nostrils,	 inhaling	 deeply.	 It	 was	 intoxicating,	 like	 pure	 bottled	 summer.	 It reminded	 him	 of	 happier	 times.	 Mowing	 the	 lawn	 on	 a	 hot	 mid-August	 day, collecting	 the	 clippings,	 sitting	 in	 a	 deckchair	 reading	 the	 paper,	 T-shirt	 off, enjoying	 the	 sunshine.	 He	 closed	 his	 eyes,	 savouring	 the	 memory.	 He	 looked down	for	a	second,	weighing	Riley's	words,	letting	the	grass	fall	slowly	from	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">fingers.	 He	 couldn't	 risk	 losing	 another	 team	 member,	 could	 he?	 There	 was	 no way	he	could	guarantee	their	safety.	He	nodded,	his	mind	made	up.	With	a	raised</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyebrow	he	answered	in	barely	above	a	whisper.	“We	just	have	to	make	sure	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t	get	caught.	When	have	I	ever	let	you	down?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	winked	playfully	and	instantly	regretted	it.	Riley	wasn’t	in	the	mood.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">muttered	 something	 under	 her	 breath	 and	 handed	 the	 binoculars	 back	 to	 Zed, sliding	down	the	bank	to	join	the	others	who	were	relaxing	against	a	crumbling</p>
<p class="calibre1">old	brick	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 looked	 over	 his	 shoulder	 and	 watched	 her	 go	 before	 continuing	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">surveillance.	 He	 swept	 the	 maintenance	 area	 of	 the	 hospital	 once	 more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Industrial	 bins	 overflowed	 with	 hospital	 waste.	 A	 ten-feet-high	 fence	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">flecked	with	bits	of	newspaper	caught	in	the	mesh	like	a	fishing	net. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	gust	of	wind	toyed	with	sheets	of	newspaper,	dancing	in	the	air,	sending	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cardboard	box	scraping	across	the	tarmac.	Litter	carpeted	the	whole	area.	In	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">corner,	 several	 vehicles	 had	 been	 abandoned,	 windows	 smashed	 in.	 An</p>
<p class="calibre1">ambulance	sat	with	its	contents	disgorged	around	it,	tyres	deflated,	its	bay	doors</p>
<p class="calibre1">swinging	 open	 in	 the	 breeze.	 He	 moved	 twenty	 metres	 to	 his	 right	 so	 he	 could get	a	better	look	round	the	corner	into	the	staff	parking	area.	The	chimney	for	the incinerator	towered	over	the	main	building,	a	wisp	of	grey	smoke	escaping	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 rim.	 There	 were	 about	 twenty	 vehicles,	 a	 few	 of	 them	 abandoned	 wrecks, harvested	for	parts	or	fire	damaged.	Parked	in	a	line	closer	to	the	main	entrance, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 saw	 several	 serviceable	 cars,	 trucks	 and	 a	 Tesco	 lorry	 backed	 up	 for unloading.	Further	away,	he	could	make	out	a	pair	of	Range	Rovers	like	the	ones</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	had	seen	on	the	high	street,	parked	up	under	an	awning.	His	hunch	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">right	all	along. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	shook	his	head.	The	fence	was	the	problem.	It	protected	the	whole	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	 of	 the	 hospital.	 He	 had	 to	 assume	 this	 whole	 area	 was	 regularly	 patrolled with	 a	 lookout	 on	 the	 roof.	 This	 crew	 was	 well	 organised	 and	 not	 to	 be underestimated.	They	worked	with	an	almost	military	efficiency.	On	his	own	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">backed	 himself	 to	 infiltrate	 the	 facility,	 but	 with	 a	 couple	 of	 inexperienced</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>teenagers	 in	 tow,	 he	 was	 less	 sure.	 Perhaps	 Riley	 was	 right	 after	 all.	 Was	 he putting	the	whole	team	in	danger	to	save	one	man?	It	was	a	big	call. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	best	chance	of	entry	was	via	a	tree	whose	branches	overhung	part	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fence.	If	they	could	climb	the	tree	and	shuffle	along	a	sturdy-looking	branch	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	was	confident	they	could	make	it	over.	Their	next	challenge	was	going	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">getting	in	unseen	and	finding	where	they	were	holding	Will.	They	needed	to	find</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	door	or	window,	somewhere	quiet	and	unseen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	found	what	he	was	looking	for	on	his	final	sweep:	a	fire	door	behind	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 industrial	 waste	 bins.	 He	 doubted	 it	 was	 still	 alarmed.	 It	 would	 be protected	 by	 a	 simple	 metal	 rod	 that	 locked	 in	 place	 top	 and	 bottom.	 The doorway	 was	 almost	 completely	 hidden	 from	 view	 by	 the	 waste	 bin	 and	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">burned-out	estate	car.	They	could	work	on	the	lock	without	fear	of	interruption. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	one	hour	of	observation,	he	was	satisfied	that	there	were	no	patrols.	If</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	could	get	over	the	fence,	they	had	a	good	chance	of	getting	in	without	being</p>
<p class="calibre1">discovered.	He	crept	back	down	on	his	hands	and	knees	to	find	the	others	talking</p>
<p class="calibre1">quietly,	hidden	from	sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	would	need	to	sit	tight	for	another	hour	waiting	for	dusk,	though	not	too</p>
<p class="calibre1">dark	 that	 they	 couldn’t	 see	 what	 they	 were	 doing.	 Torches	 were	 a	 bad	 idea	 as they	could	be	seen	from	miles	away	and	would	attract	unwanted	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 hospital	 was	 a	 prime	 site	 and	 could	 comfortably	 host	 several	 hundred people,	a	much	bigger	group	than	Hurst.	Its	location	in	the	town	made	access	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">food	 and	 stores	 relatively	 simple.	 Zed	 didn’t	 fancy	 his	 chances	 in	 a	 fire	 fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stealth	was	their	best	option. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	 inside,	 Sean	 said	 he’d	 been	 to	 this	 hospital	 before	 so	 knew	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">approximate	 layout.	 The	 maintenance	 area	 was	 unlikely	 to	 be	 occupied,	 and from	 what	 they’d	 observed,	 the	 overnight	 patient	 wards	 on	 the	 first	 or	 second floor	of	the	east	wing	were	the	most	likely	places	they’d	be	holding	Will.	And	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">not,	that	was	a	good	place	to	start	their	search. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	each	checked	their	equipment.	As	well	as	the	revolver	and	the	shotgun, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they	had	an	eclectic	assortment	of	weapons	laid	out	on	the	grass	from	a	machete</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 an	 ivory-handled	 dagger	 to	 the	 double-headed	 mace	 which	 Zed	 still	 had strapped	between	his	shoulder	blades.	Riley	uncocked	the	sawn-off	shotgun	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">carried,	peered	down	the	barrels	to	make	sure	they	were	clear,	loaded	two	shells</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	snapped	the	barrels	closed	with	a	satisfying	click.	In	the	side-pocket	of	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">rucksack	 she	 placed	 a	 further	 box	 of	 shells	 and	 made	 sure	 she	 had	 a	 couple	 of spares	in	her	hip	pocket	for	easy	access.	Sean	was	lying	on	his	back	against	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rucksack,	meticulously	sharpening	the	blade	on	the	ceremonial	sword	he’d	found</p>
<p class="calibre1">earlier	 with	 a	 small	 metal	 file.	 He	 tested	 the	 edge	 with	 his	 finger	 every	 few minutes	to	check	its	sharpness	before	continuing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>Mila	 sat	 cross-legged,	 watching	 the	 others,	 her	 back	 to	 a	 tree.	 Her	 khaki shorts	had	ridden	up,	exposing	a	three-inch	scar	on	her	right	thigh.	She	tied	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">hair	 back	 and	 picked	 a	 blade	 of	 grass	 out	 of	 her	 mouth,	 wiping	 it	 on	 her	 knee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	sat	opposite	her	and	took	a	long	swig	from	his	canteen	before	offering	it	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	others.	Despite	their	meagre	diet,	Joe’s	early	middle-aged	spread	had	proven</p>
<p class="calibre1">hard	to	shift.	Everyone	else	seemed	to	be	losing	weight	but	him.	He	was	fed	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	being	the	butt	of	their	jokes.	Lard-ass,	fat-boy,	tubby.	He	had	heard	them	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 told	 him	 he	 was	 thick-skinned.	 Deep	 down,	 Joe	 was	 hurting	 but	 too proud	to	let	them	know	they	had	landed	a	punch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	 had	 been	 watching	 Mila	 all	 day;	 he	 couldn’t	 take	 his	 eyes	 off	 her.	 Ever since	 she’d	 arrived	 at	 Hurst,	 he’d	 been	 mesmerised.	 She	 was	 at	 least	 fifteen years	his	junior,	but	she	had	so	much	vitality.	She	was	athletic	and	slim-hipped</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 knew	 the	 effect	 she	 had	 on	 men.	 Zed	 hadn’t	 figured	 out	 whether	 Mila	 and Sean	were	just	friends	or	something	more.	It	had	been	bugging	him	for	days.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">caught	Joe	staring	absent-mindedly	and	he	looked	away	embarrassed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	you	looking	at,	Joe?	Seen	anything	you	like?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	mumbled	something	back,	struggling	to	hide	his	blushes.	Sean	grinned	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 pair	 of	 them	 and	 mischievously	 threw	 a	 small	 stone	 at	 Mila,	 hitting	 her	 on her	ankle.	She	looked	up	angrily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 ignored	 her	 protest	 and	 whispered,	 “Don’t	 waste	 your	 time.	 She	 ain’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">worth	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	 because	 I	 don’t	 fancy	 you,	 Sean,	 don’t	 mean	 nothing.	 Perhaps	 you’re just	not	my	type,”	said	Mila	coquettishly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	shushed	them	and	they	fell	silent.	“Let's	cut	the	chat	and	switch	on.	Do</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	want	me	to	run	through	the	plan	one	more	time?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	all	shook	their	heads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	Zed,	we	get	it,”	sighed	Riley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 we’ll	 keep	 going	 over	 it	 until	 it’s	 locked	 and	 loaded.”	 Zed	 looked around	 each	 of	 the	 group,	 lingering	 on	 the	 two	 teenagers,	 Sean	 and	 Mila. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Planning	is	what	keeps	us	safe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	unfolded	the	piece	of	paper	with	Sean's	crude	sketch	of	the	hospital	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">its	layout.	“So,	let's	go	over	this	one	more	time.	I’m	on	point.	Riley	is	bringing</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	the	rear.	The	rest	of	you	stay	alert	and	focused.	Two	teams	sweeping	the	first</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	second	floors,	here,	here	and	here,”	he	said,	pointing	to	the	overnight	wards</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 map.	 “Hand	 signals	 only.	 We	 can’t	 afford	 to	 make	 any	 noise.	 If	 we	 see anyone,	 we	 hide.	 Don’t	 take	 any	 chances.	 Okay?	 Now	 everyone	 get	 some	 rest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	move	out	in	thirty	minutes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 all	 nodded.	 Mila	 closed	 her	 eyes	 and	 started	 humming	 an	 old	 Aretha</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a>Franklin	tune,	“Respect”.	She	finished	tying	back	her	long	dark	hair	in	a	ponytail that	 reached	 down	 past	 her	 shoulders	 and	 part	 way	 down	 her	 back.	 When	 she was	done,	she	put	on	a	grey	baseball	cap	from	her	rucksack	that	cast	a	shadow</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	her	petite	nose	and	narrow	lips.	She	wore	no	make-up	and	had	a	smear	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">mud	 or	 grease	 across	 her	 left	 cheek.	 It	 didn’t	 matter	 much.	 She	 still	 looked beautiful.	Joe	followed	her	lead	and	put	his	cap	over	his	face,	resting	his	eyes	for a	few	minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	sat	back	against	a	telegraph	post	and	tried	to	relax.	Inside,	his	heart	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">beating	 unusually	 fast.	 This	 was	 a	 big	 call	 taking	 an	 inexperienced	 team	 into	 a well-defended	 and	 densely	 populated	 environment	 that	 he	 knew	 virtually</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing	about.	They	would	need	luck	on	their	side.	He	looked	around	the	group, </p>
<p class="calibre1">weighing	 up	 their	 strengths	 and	 weaknesses.	 From	 what	 he’d	 seen	 of	 the	 new arrivals,	they	were	both	fit	and	able.	If	they	had	to	get	out	of	there	quickly,	Joe was	 the	 weak	 link,	 heavy	 and	 slow.	 He	 had	 taught	 them	 all	 what	 little	 he remembered	 about	 self-defence	 and	 hand-to-hand	 combat.	 Joe	 was	 powerful, </p>
<p class="calibre1">threw	a	good	punch.	Riley	and	Sean	showed	some	skill	with	a	knife.	As	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rest,	he	had	no	idea.	Did	they	even	know	what	they	were	letting	themselves	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">for?	Riley	did,	Mila	looked	terrified	but	was	hiding	it	well	from	the	others.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">others	were	hard	to	read,	but	chances	were	they	were	all	terrified.	If	they	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">find	 out	 where	 they	 were	 holding	 Will,	 then	 maybe,	 just	 maybe	 they	 could	 get him	 out	 from	 right	 under	 their	 noses	 without	 anyone	 noticing.	 They	 owed	 it	 to Will	to	at	least	try. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	closed	his	eyes	and	ran	through	the	plan	once	more	in	his	head.	It	was	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	him	to	get	them	in	and	out	safely,	without	casualties.	There	was	no	margin	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">error	tonight. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Twenty-two</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 was	 the	 last	 over	 the	 fence.	 The	 sleeve	 of	 her	 jacket	 caught	 on	 some barbed	 wire	 and	 ripped.	 Off	 balance,	 she	 landed	 heavily	 on	 the	 grass	 verge below,	twisting	her	ankle	a	little.	The	fence	rattled	behind	her.	“Nice	one,	Riley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Get	it	together,”	she	muttered	to	herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 rest	 of	 the	 group	 was	 already	 at	 the	 fire	 door.	 Zed	 started	 loosening	 up the	frame	with	a	crowbar,	splintering	the	wood	around	the	locking	mechanism.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">took	around	ten	minutes	for	the	reinforced	surround	to	cave	in,	and	with	a	loud</p>
<p class="calibre1">creak	Zed	levered	open	the	door	a	crack.	He	got	his	fingers	inside	and	wrenched</p>
<p class="calibre1">open	the	door	wider,	its	rotten	base	scraping	against	the	concrete	floor.	Inside,	it took	 a	 moment	 for	 their	 eyes	 to	 adjust	 to	 the	 gloom.	 They	 picked	 their	 way carefully	around	some	machinery	and	shelving	units.	The	room	was	completely</p>
<p class="calibre1">dark,	 other	 than	 a	 rectangle	 of	 light	 from	 the	 doorway	 and	 from	 two	 narrow skylights	that	cast	fading	shadows	across	the	machinery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Double	doors	led	through	to	one	of	the	main	corridors	running	north	to	south</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 far	 as	 the	 eye	 could	 see.	 From	 Sean’s	 crude	 drawing	 of	 the	 hospital	 layout, Zed	figured	this	would	take	them	to	the	stairwell	that	led	to	the	upper	floors.	The corridor	was	eerily	quiet.	There	was	not	a	soul	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 regrouped	 in	 a	 consultation	 room	 off	 to	 their	 left,	 huddling	 together around	Zed.	He	crouched	down,	one	knee	on	the	linoleum	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	the	hell	is	everyone?”	asked	Riley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 shrugged	 his	 shoulders.	 “Looks	 like	 no	 one’s	 home.	 So	 let’s	 make	 the most	of	it.	According	to	Sean’s	map	there’s	a	stairwell	just	up	here,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sean	leaned	in,	angling	the	piece	of	paper	towards	him	to	check	and	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.	So	let’s	head	up	to	the	next	floor.	Mila,	you	stay	with	me.	The	rest	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	go	with	Riley.	Stay	together.	Let’s	get	this	done	quickly	and	get	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	led	the	way	back	into	the	corridor,	keeping	to	the	left	side	and	pausing	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">each	doorway	to	listen.	Where	the	walkway	opened	out	into	a	lobby	area,	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	a	lone	flickering	candle	in	a	saucer,	but	still	no	sign	of	anyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	pointed	to	a	blue	sign	directing	them	to	the	stairwell.	She	put	her	hands</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 heavy	 door	 and	 put	 her	 weight	 against	 it,	 easing	 it	 open	 silently.	 At	 the foot	of	the	stairs,	she	craned	her	neck	to	peer	between	the	railings,	making	sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	was	no	one	coming.	Zed	was	already	suspicious.	It	was	all	going	a	little	too</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>well.	Were	they	walking	into	a	trap? </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	top	of	the	stairs,	Riley	cracked	open	the	door	to	the	first	floor,	listening carefully.	She	crouched	down,	her	fingers	pressed	to	her	lips.	They	could	all	hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">voices.	She	opened	the	door	wider	and	stuck	her	head	around	the	corner.	About</p>
<p class="calibre1">thirty	metres	away	she	could	see	half	a	dozen	people,	with	their	backs	to	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 stole	 across	 the	 corridor	 and	 waited	 out	 of	 sight.	 Zed	 waved	 Riley forward,	 encouraging	 her	 group	 to	 start	 their	 search,	 while	 he	 and	 Mila	 stood guard	 and	 spied	 on	 the	 hospital	 group.	 They	 had	 no	 trouble	 keeping	 to	 the shadows.	The	first	floor	was	poorly	lit	with	candles	and	kerosene	lamps.	Skirting</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	the	back	of	the	group,	they	followed	the	U-shape	until	it	opened	out	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	large	atrium	that	overlooked	a	lobby	area.	Below	them	they	could	hear	voices</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 the	 unmistakeable	 sounds	 of	 a	 large	 gathering,	 bodies	 pressed	 tightly together,	feet	shuffling	and	a	man	coughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	took	up	position	next	to	a	large	pot	plant,	his	senses	alert.	To	their	right, </p>
<p class="calibre1">around	a	dozen	doctors	and	medical	staff	were	leaning	over	the	railing	listening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	of	the	doctors	had	their	arms	crossed.	Their	body	language	seemed	hostile</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	if	they	were	removed	from	whatever	was	being	discussed	below.	Two	men	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">white	lab	coats	whispered	conspiratorially,	but	he	couldn’t	catch	what	they	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">saying	from	this	distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 crept	 forward,	 Mila	 beside	 him,	 and	 peered	 between	 the	 railings	 at	 the sea	of	faces	gathered	on	the	ground	floor.	A	couple	of	hundred	heads	were	facing</p>
<p class="calibre1">away	from	him,	craning	necks	and	squinting	into	the	relative	gloom	to	see	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	going	on	at	the	far	end	of	the	lobby.	He	crouched	low	but	still	couldn’t	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	they	were	looking	at. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	crowd	fell	silent	as	a	man’s	voice	carried	across	the	room.	It	was	a	voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	recognised	from	earlier	in	the	day.	Clipped,	Mancunian,	slightly	nasal	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">hard	edge.	The	hairs	at	the	back	of	his	neck	prickled	as	he	remembered	the	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 black's	 face	 across	 the	 street	 from	 earlier,	 his	 fists	 clenching	 tight, remembering	what	they	had	done	to	Bob. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 all	 know	 how	 hard	 we’ve	 fought	 to	 get	 this	 far.	 It	 hasn’t	 been	 easy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’ve	all	lost	someone	or	something.	But	together	we’re	getting	stronger	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">day.	 Look	 around	 you.	 We	 have	 food,	 a	 roof	 over	 our	 heads,	 weapons,	 and security.	We	even	have	our	own	doctors	to	treat	us	when	we	get	sick.	But	if	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	going	to	do	more	than	just	survive,	we	need	to	expand	our	operation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	murmurs	of	approval	and	nods	from	a	few	of	the	heads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Every	 day	 our	 patrols	 bring	 back	 men,	 women	 and	 children	 from	 places</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	 here.	 Every	 day	 we	 learn	 about	 other	 survivor	 camps	 throughout	 this area.	 Dozens	 of	 them,	 big	 and	 small.	 Beyond	 the	 New	 Forest,	 there	 may	 be hundreds	 more	 groups	 like	 us,	 surviving,	 holding	 on,	 waiting.	 We	 have	 a	 good</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>set-up	here.	We	have	everything	we	need.	So	why	do	we	need	to	change?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	paused,	letting	the	question	resonate	with	his	audience.	“Let	me	tell	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">why.	 We	 have	 a	 chance	 to	 become	 something	 more.	 To	 take	 a	 lead.	 To	 build	 a new	world	order	based	on	our	rules.	No	one	can	tell	us	what	to	do	any	more	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">how	to	think	or	how	to	act.	We	don’t	have	to	go	back	to	the	way	things	were.	We</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	build	something	new,	something	better.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 found	 himself	 nodding.	 He	 sounded	 a	 lot	 like	 the	 man	 he	 wished	 Jack would	be.	He	was	right.	Survival	was	not	enough,	but	Jack	didn't	think	like	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 in	 black’s	 speech	 crystallised	 some	 of	 Zed's	 unspoken	 thoughts	 and hopes	for	Hurst. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 whispers	 below	 grew	 to	 a	 louder	 discussion,	 and	 another	 man’s	 voice, deeper	 and	 menacing,	 appealed	 for	 quiet	 in	 vain.	 He	 put	 his	 fingers	 to	 his	 lips and	whistled	sharply	until	the	room	fell	silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even	now,	our	doctors	are	working	hard	to	understand	more	about	the	virus, </p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 find	 a	 cure.	 In	 time,	 we	 hope	 to	 synthesise	 a	 vaccine,	 however	 long	 that takes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	louder	murmurs	of	approval	as	if,	for	a	delicious	moment,	several</p>
<p class="calibre1">amongst	them	dared	to	hope	that	such	a	vaccine	was	within	reach.	He	waited	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	crowd	to	fall	silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	don’t	yet	know	why	but	certain	individuals	have	natural	immunity	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">virus.	We’re	getting	closer	to	finding	out	every	day.	With	the	right	resources	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">support,	there’s	no	reason	we	can’t	find	the	answer	and	mass-produce	a	vaccine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	can	start	inoculating	hundreds,	maybe	thousands,	of	survivors.	Spreading	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">word,	spreading	the	cure,	not	just	to	the	New	Forest	but	also	to	the	whole	region. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps	even	the	whole	country.	Imagine	for	a	second	the	power	and	influence</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	discovery	would	deliver.	Starting	tomorrow,	we	begin	reaching	out	to	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">groups.	We	invite	them	to	join	forces	with	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	dissenting	voice	from	the	back	shouted	out,	“What	if	they	don’t	want	to? </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	can’t	make	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 in	 black	 laughed	 dismissively,	 pointing	 in	 his	 direction.	 “You’re right.	No	one	can	force	them	to	join	us.	But…”	He	paused	for	a	moment.	“They</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	be	foolish	to	stand	against	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 were	 hoots	 of	 derision	 from	 those	 members	 of	 the	 audience	 who</p>
<p class="calibre1">distrusted	the	man	in	black	and	his	thinly	disguised	ambition.	He	was	forced	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">wait	until	the	raucous	noise	from	the	increasingly	partisan	crowd	abated	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	could	continue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	will	be	those	that	disagree	with	our	methods.	Let	them.	When	they	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	we	are	building,	when	they	hear	that	we	have	the	cure,	when	they	see	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 future	 holds,	 then	 they	 will	 understand.	 Our	 way	 of	 life	 means	 growth	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>prosperity.	 Security	 for	 all.	 If	 they	 join	 us,	 then	 we	 all	 stand	 together,	 united. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	are	either	with	us,	or	against	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	clear	to	Zed	that	the	assembled	crowd	was	deeply	divided.	The	whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">room	seemed	to	erupt,	catalysed	by	the	emotive	discussion.	It	seemed	like	all	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 anger,	 their	 hopes	 and	 fears	 boiled	 over	 with	 factions	 shouting	 at	 each other.	 There	 was	 some	 pushing	 and	 shoving.	 Men	 squared	 up	 to	 each	 other, fingers	 jabbed	 in	 faces.	 A	 couple	 of	 punches	 were	 thrown,	 as	 order	 rapidly degenerated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 had	 heard	 and	 seen	 enough.	 It	 reminded	 him	 of	 the	 early	 days	 at	 Hurst before	 the	 community	 coalesced	 around	 a	 common	 vision	 for	 the	 future.	 He slipped	 away	 from	 the	 railing,	 beckoning	 Mila	 to	 follow	 him.	 Together	 they joined	the	others,	searching	the	rest	of	the	first	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	 of	 the	 rooms	 were	 either	 locked	 or	 empty.	 Double	 doors	 to	 a	 larger overnight	ward	were	barred	from	the	outside	with	a	piece	of	wood	padlocked	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">place.	There	was	a	good	chance	that	this	was	where	they	were	holding	Will.	Two</p>
<p class="calibre1">small	 square	 observation	 windows	 were	 papered	 over	 with	 dried	 tissue.	 Riley scratched	some	off	with	her	fingernail.	She	heard	a	chair	scrape	from	the	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">side	and	muffled	voices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	peeled	off	more	paper,	trying	to	see	inside.	Riley	jumped	back	startled	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	bearded	face	filled	the	square	window.	He	looked	dishevelled,	his	hair	grey	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">unkempt.	He	started	banging	his	fists	on	the	door	weakly.	She	gestured	for	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	stop,	afraid	that	the	noise	would	attract	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 old	 man	 put	 his	 face	 to	 the	 crack	 and	 whispered,	 “Please	 help	 us.”	 He rattled	the	handle	on	the	double	doors,	but	they	were	securely	fastened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	looked	around	the	door	frame	for	a	key	but	saw	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	joined	her	at	the	double	doors,	thinking	Will	might	be	inside.	He	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	 out	 about	 a	 dozen	 beds	 with	 every	 inch	 of	 floor	 space	 occupied	 by	 men and	women.	Who	knew	how	long	they	had	been	kept	there?	Judging	by	the	filth</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	foul	stench	it	had	been	some	time.	They	looked	malnourished.	Some	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">barely	stand.	They	huddled	close	to	the	door,	appealing	weakly	to	Riley	and	Zed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	get	them	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	 looking	 for	 Will.	 South	 African	 guy?”	 whispered	 Zed	 as	 loud	 as	 he dared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 old	 man	 shook	 his	 head.	 “There’s	 no	 one	 of	 that	 name	 or	 nationality here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 turned	 to	 go,	 but	 the	 old	 man	 called	 him	 back.	 “Please.	 Don’t	 leave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’ve	got	to	help	us.	You	need	to	understand	what’s	really	going	on	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	talking	about?”	He	frowned	at	Riley.	“Look,	we'd	like	to	help</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	but	without	the	key…” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a>“Wait,	please.	You	need	to	get	word	to	the	others.	They’re	experimenting	on us.	Sometimes	we	can	hear	their	screams.	No	one	ever	comes	back.	Every	day, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they	take	one	more	of	us	away…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	looked	at	 Riley,	struggling	to	 understand.	What	kind	 of	hospital	locked</p>
<p class="calibre1">people	up	and	treated	them	like	lab	rats?	He	rattled	the	padlock	and	heavy	chain</p>
<p class="calibre1">securing	the	makeshift	bar,	blocking	the	doors	from	being	opened.	“Believe	me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">we	want	to	help	you,	but	there’s	nothing	we	can	do.	The	door	is	padlocked.	I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">sorry.	Unless	you	know	where	they	keep	the	key?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 fat	 man	 always	 has	 the	 key	 on	 a	 chain	 around	 his	 neck.	 He	 always keeps	it	locked.”	He	slammed	the	door	again	in	frustration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,	we’ll	come	back	if	we	can	and	try	and	get	you	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	backed	away	from	the	door.	Zed	felt	bad	leaving	them	here	like	this.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew	 they	 were	 leaving	 them	 here	 to	 die,	 to	 face	 torture,	 experiments,	 heaven knows	 what.	 He	 hurried	 down	 the	 corridor	 to	 rejoin	 Riley	 and	 the	 others	 who were	checking	the	rest	of	the	rooms	on	this	floor.	He	couldn't	shake	the	feeling</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 they	 had	 stumbled	 upon	 something	 significant,	 but	 the	 truth	 was	 eluding him.	What	were	they	doing	to	them?	What	did	the	old	man	mean	when	he	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	were	experimenting	on	them? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	 on,	 let’s	 find	 Will	 and	 get	 out	 of	 this	 place,”	 said	 Riley,	 pulling	 at Zed’s	sleeve,	eager	to	leave. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Twenty-three</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 the	 next	 floor,	 the	 two	 teams	 split	 up	 and	 set	 off	 in	 opposite	 directions, sweeping	silently	from	room	to	room.	There	was	still	no	sign	of	Will,	and	Riley</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	beginning	to	lose	hope.	She	had	made	the	grim	discovery	of	a	waiting	room</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	used	as	a	mortuary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five	bodies	were	laid	out	in	an	orderly	row	with	a	sheet	over	each	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 pulled	 her	 sweater	 up	 over	 her	 mouth	 and	 tried	 to	 avoid	 breathing	 in	 the stench.	She	lifted	up	the	corner	of	a	sheet	covering	the	body	closest	to	her	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">recoiled	at	the	sight	of	a	body	ravaged	by	sickness.	A	young	woman’s	blue	eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">stared	 blankly	 up	 at	 the	 ceiling.	 The	 victim	 could	 have	 been	 no	 more	 than eighteen.	Her	face	was	gaunt,	her	skin	drawn	tight.	Dried	blood	crusted	around</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 nose	 and	 ears.	 She	 wore	 a	 pale	 yellow	 dress	 with	 a	 plunging	 neckline,	 her bra	 strap	 exposed.	 Along	 her	 alabaster-white	 left	 arm	 was	 a	 crop	 of	 needle marks,	 many	 in	 small	 red	 circles.	 Riley	 had	 seen	 her	 fair	 share	 of	 death,	 but seeing	 one	 so	 young,	 in	 the	 prime	 of	 her	 life,	 chilled	 her	 to	 the	 very	 bone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Judging	by	the	girl’s	face,	she	had	died	only	very	recently,	probably	in	the	last</p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty-four	 hours.	 She	 was	 surprised	 they	 hadn’t	 moved	 the	 bodies	 already. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back	at	Hurst,	they	burned	the	dead	to	reduce	the	risk	of	contamination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	moved	to	the	next	section	through	a	heavy	security	door	with	a	keypad</p>
<p class="calibre1">entry	 system	 whose	 screen	 was	 inactive.	 The	 sign	 above	 the	 doorway	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">marked	 “Restricted	 Access	 –	 No	 Admittance”.	 To	 her	 surprise	 she	 found	 the door	 unlocked.	 She	 pushed	 on,	 her	 senses	 alert,	 checking	 behind	 her,	 making sure	no	one	was	following. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	whipped	her	head	around	at	the	sound	of	a	light	tapping	from	one	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rooms	at	the	end	of	the	corridor.	Treading	lightly,	controlling	her	breaths	as	best she	could,	she	leaned	against	the	painted	wooden	door,	listening	carefully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	is	there	somebody	there?”	came	a	child’s	voice	from	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl	sounded	very	young	and	frightened.	Zed	had	been	very	clear.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	here	for	Will.	They	couldn’t	save	everyone.	The	girl’s	voice	interrupted	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment	of	indecision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	hear	you	breathing.	Please,	can	you	get	me	out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 tried	 the	 handle	 but	 the	 door	 was	 locked.	 She	 got	 down	 on	 one	 knee and	looked	through	the	keyhole.	A	green	eye	with	long	lashes	close	to	the	hole</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a>blinked	 back	 at	 her.	 The	 top	 lock	 was	 basic,	 the	 kind	 Riley	 knew	 how	 to	 open with	a	credit	card,	providing	the	lower	mortise	lock	wasn't	engaged.	She	checked</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	pockets	but	found	nothing.	There	wasn’t	much	call	for	credit	cards	any	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	around	her	and	noticed	a	door	open	to	what	looked	like	a	staffroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 nurse’s	 uniform	 hung	 next	 to	 a	 cheap	 white	 desk	 with	 a	 grey	 computer monitor,	its	screen	lifeless.	She	checked	the	pockets	before	finding	a	set	of	keys</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	a	“lucky	eight	ball”	attached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	third	attempt,	the	key	turned.	Before	she	knew	it,	a	little	girl	wrenched</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	door	open	from	her	grasp	and	brushed	past	her.	She	was	no	more	than	ten	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">eleven,	 with	 long	 dark	 hair,	 dressed	 in	 clothes	 that	 looked	 a	 size	 too	 small	 for her.	She	hugged	Riley	and	stepped	back	to	get	a	proper	look.	Riley	checked	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	sure	there	was	no	one	else	hiding	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl	said	her	name	was	Adele.	She	had	been	brought	here	a	few	days	ago</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	her	older	brother	Jamie.	They	had	been	separated	and	she	hadn’t	heard	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">seen	him	since.	She	rolled	up	her	sleeve	and	showed	Riley	a	series	of	pinprick-</p>
<p class="calibre1">marks	on	her	skin	where	they	had	injected	her	and	taken	her	blood.	For	the	last</p>
<p class="calibre1">two	 weeks	 she	 had	 been	 held	 in	 isolation.	 She	 wasn’t	 sure	 why,	 but	 it	 meant better	food	and	daily	injections. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	studied	the	marks	on	her	arm,	too	many	to	count.	Who	would	do	this	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	child?	she	asked	herself.	She	had	worked	in	the	health	system	long	enough	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognise	what	looked	like	the	arm	of	a	junkie,	but	why	would	they	repeatedly</p>
<p class="calibre1">inject	a	child?	Adele	didn’t	look	ill.	Why	keep	her	in	isolation?	Why	would	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	that?	There	was	no	way	she	was	leaving	a	child	to	die	in	this	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 coming	 with	 us,”	 said	 Riley,	 with	 a	 smile.	 The	 little	 girl	 grinned, revealing	a	couple	of	missing	teeth.	Riley	dropped	down	on	to	her	knees	so	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">faces	 were	 level.	 “First,	 I	 have	 something	 very	 important	 to	 ask	 you.	 We’re looking	for	a	friend.	His	name	is	Will.	He’s	South	African.	Do	you	know	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	might	find	him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl	shook	her	head	and	balanced	on	tiptoes	to	make	herself	taller,	taking</p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley’s	hand	to	steady	herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sean	 reappeared	 from	 his	 sweep	 of	 the	 other	 corridor.	 He	 looked	 Adele	 up and	 down,	 shaking	 his	 head.	 “Who	 the	 hell’s	 this?	 We	 can’t	 take	 a	 kid,	 Riley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’ll	only	slow	us	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	want	to	hear	about	it,	Sean.	She’s	coming	with	us.	We’re	not	leaving</p>
<p class="calibre1">her,	okay?	End	of	story.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine.	She’s	your	baggage.”	He	tutted	to	himself	and	wandered	off	to	check</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	last	of	the	rooms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	okay	when	you	get	to	know	him,”	said	Riley,	reassuringly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	made	to	leave	but	the	little	girl	pulled	her	back.	“Wait.	There’s	someone</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>else.	She’s	like	me,	Riley,	but	older.	Her	name’s	Stella.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	dragged	Riley	along.	Her	delicate	soft	fingers	laced	through	Riley's,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 stood	 outside	 the	 last	 door.	 They	 tried	 all	 the	 keys,	 but	 none	 of	 them worked.	Riley	shrugged	her	shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,	kiddo.	We	could	go	back	to	the	nurse’s	station	and	try	the	drawers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Adele	 stared	 down	 at	 the	 floor.	 Her	 whole	 body	 seemed	 to	 sag.	 She</p>
<p class="calibre1">straightened	suddenly	as	if	electrified	by	a	thought.	She	tried	the	handle	and	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">both	of	their	surprise	the	door	swung	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 the	 sound	 of	 coughing,	 and	 a	 young	 woman	 sat	 up	 in	 bed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">clutching	 a	 brown	 hospital	 blanket	 to	 her	 bare	 chest.	 She	 glowered	 at	 Riley, clearly	annoyed	at	the	intrusion.	Her	eyes	darted	furtively	across	to	Adele.	There</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 a	 flicker	 of	 recognition,	 but	 her	 expression	 remained	 the	 same:	 a	 curious blend	of	defiance	and	vulnerability.	She	looked	back	at	Adele,	confused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	 is	 she,	 Adele?”	 she	 said,	 before	 addressing	 Riley	 directly.	 “What	 do you	want?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	here	to	rescue	us,”	said	the	girl	brightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	exactly,”	corrected	Riley.	“We’re	looking	for	our	friend	Will	and	found</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 two	 instead.”	 There	 was	 something	 about	 the	 girl	 that	 Riley	 didn’t	 trust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 pointed	 to	 the	 door.	 “All	 the	 other	 rooms	 were	 locked.	 How	 come	 yours isn’t?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	young	woman	yawned	and	swung	her	legs	off	the	bed.	She	reached	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	grabbed	a	top	that	lay	crumpled	on	a	blue	plastic	chair	by	the	wall.	Facing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	wall,	she	dropped	the	blanket.	She	was	underdeveloped	for	her	age	with	slim</p>
<p class="calibre1">hips	and	a	narrow	waist.	Her	pale	shoulders	and	back	were	covered	in	small	red</p>
<p class="calibre1">marks	 and	 dark	 bruises.	 Her	 spine	 and	 rib	 cage	 were	 clearly	 visible	 as	 she hunched	over.	Riley	noticed	her	wrists.	They	looked	raw	and	swollen	where	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">must	 have	 been	 tied	 up	 previously.	 The	 girl	 threaded	 her	 arms	 through	 the sleeves	of	a	grey-white	sweatshirt	with	a	faded	Mickey	Mouse	on	the	front. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	glanced	back	at	them,	her	face	half-hidden	again	by	reddish-blonde	hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 looked	 like	 a	 frightened	 animal,	 wild	 and	 untamed.	 “They	 leave	 mine</p>
<p class="calibre1">unlocked	because	they	know	I	won’t	leave.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	a	prisoner	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	wouldn’t	understand.	It’s	not	as	simple	as	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Try	me,”	said	Riley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They…they	keep	me	here,”	continued	the	girl.	“I	can’t	leave.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 looked	 puzzled.	 “In	 what	 way?	 Are	 you	 a	 patient	 or	 a	 prisoner?”	 she said	scornfully	and	regretted	it.	The	words	just	slipped	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	like	that.”	Her	cheeks	flushed	red.	“Look,	if	I	do	what	they	say	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything’s	fine.	They	bring	me	food,	treat	me	nice.	But	if	I	don’t	then	they	beat</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>me.	At	first	I	fought	back,	but	now	I’ve	learned	to	just	shut	up	and	let	them…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	voice	trailed	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl	looked	down	at	her	bare	feet,	wiggling	her	toes	childishly.	She	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	Mila’s	age,	but	pale	and	thin.	Riley	walked	over	and	put	an	arm	around	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">waist.	“Come	on.	Let’s	get	you	out	of	here.	You’re	coming	with	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stella	 seemed	 uncertain.	 “Please,	 just	 leave	 me	 here.	 If	 they	 find	 me	 out	 of my	room,	they’ll	only	beat	me	again…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 insisted.	 “We’re	 getting	 you	 out	 of	 here.	 Someplace	 safe.	 Where	 you don’t	have	to	live	like	this	any	more.	How	did	you	end	up	here	anyway?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stella	told	them	her	story	in	barely	above	a	whisper,	stopping	several	times	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">compose	 herself.	 They’d	 captured	 her	 and	 two	 of	 her	 friends	 a	 few	 miles	 from here	almost	a	month	back.	Her	friends	had	refused	to	cooperate	and	were	badly</p>
<p class="calibre1">beaten.	They	took	them	away;	she	didn’t	know	where.	One	of	the	men	was	kind</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 her	 and	 protected	 her	 from	 the	 others.	 She	 ended	 up	 here	 in	 this	 room, sleeping	for	most	of	the	day,	reading	books,	waiting	for	the	man	to	visit	her.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">started	to	cry,	beginning	to	remember	the	pain	and	horror	she	had	been	subjected</p>
<p class="calibre1">to.	Riley	had	seen	this	defence	mechanism	before	in	victims	of	abuse.	The	mind</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	 disconnected.	 Adele	 started	 shivering	 as	 suppressed	 memories	 came</p>
<p class="calibre1">flooding	 back.	 Adele	 walked	 up	 to	 her	 and	 hugged	 her	 tightly.	 Nevertheless, Stella	 seemed	 uncertain	 about	 leaving.	 They	 each	 grabbed	 a	 hand	 and	 half supported	her	as	her	legs	grew	weak	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sean	 was	 speechless	 when	 they	 found	 him.	 He	 shook	 his	 head	 at	 the	 latest addition	to	Riley’s	entourage	and	walked	away.	There	was	still	no	sign	of	Will</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	they	were	out	of	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stella	 pleaded	 with	 them	 to	 finish	 up	 and	 get	 out	 of	 there.	 She	 stood</p>
<p class="calibre1">nervously	gnawing	her	fingernails.	The	“monsters”	would	be	back	soon	and	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t	want	to	be	around	when	they	came	back.	Just	then	a	piercing	alarm	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	all	flinch,	splitting	the	air	close	to	their	heads.	They	looked	at	each	other, confused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	footsteps	coming	towards	them	along	the	corridor.	Riley	ushered</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 group	 into	 the	 nurse’s	 station	 to	 the	 right	 and	 took	 a	 deep	 breath.	 She unhooked	 the	 strap	 securing	 the	 shotgun	 to	 her	 backpack	 and	 readied	 herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 braced	 the	 stock	 against	 her	 shoulder	 like	 Zed	 had	 shown	 her	 and	 waited, half-hidden	 behind	 the	 doorway.	 As	 the	 footsteps	 grew	 louder	 she	 released	 the safety	catch	and	put	her	finger	lightly	on	the	trigger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	her	relief,	Zed	and	Mila	appeared	around	the	corner.	They	stood	staring	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 wide-eyed,	 trying	 to	 catch	 their	 breath.	 Mila	 leaned	 against	 the	 wall, fighting	for	air.	“They’re	coming,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	was	cradling	his	left	wrist,	grimacing	with	pain.	“We	need	to	leave	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>Stella	tugged	at	Riley’s	sleeve.	“There’s	another	way	out.	Follow	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	exchanged	glances	with	Sean.	“Who	are	these	two?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sean	 shrugged	 his	 shoulders.	 “Don’t	 ask.	 Riley’s	 waifs	 and	 strays,”	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">responded	sarcastically	and	followed	the	girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Twenty-four</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Stella	led	the	way	as	the	group	threw	caution	to	the	wind	and	hurried	down	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">stairs	 to	 ground	 level.	 She	 was	 light	 on	 her	 feet	 and	 seemed	 to	 know	 her	 way around	the	maze	of	passages	and	waiting	rooms.	Riley	had	to	shout	louder	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	dared	to	get	Stella	to	slow	down.	Zed	and	Sean	were	bringing	up	the	rear	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 danger	 of	 losing	 contact	 with	 the	 lead	 group.	 Behind	 them	 they	 could	 hear raised	voices.	They	didn’t	have	time	to	lose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed’s	 arm	 was	 in	 a	 bad	 way.	 It	 had	 all	 happened	 so	 quickly.	 Mila	 had	 been grabbed	 from	 behind	 and	 in	 the	 scuffle	 to	 free	 her,	 Zed	 had	 fallen.	 In	 the resulting	 wrestle	 with	 one	 of	 the	 guards,	 his	 hand	 and	 wrist	 were	 badly	 cut	 by shards	of	glass	from	a	glazed	partition	wall.	Mila	had	undertaken	some	running</p>
<p class="calibre1">repairs.	She	had	torn	off	a	strip	of	her	shirt	and	bandaged	the	injured	arm	as	best she	could.	As	they	ran,	blood	soaked	through	the	cotton	material	and	dripped	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	grey	linoleum	tiles,	leaving	a	clear	path	for	their	pursuers	to	follow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	bottom	of	the	last	flight	of	stairs,	they	regrouped.	Riley	counted	heads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 noticed	 Zed	 cradling	 his	 left	 arm	 and	 wincing	 in	 pain.	 He	 nodded.	 “Don’t slow	down	on	my	account.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	doorway	to	the	main	corridor,	she	nudged	open	the	heavy	fire	door	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">checked	the	path	ahead.	There	were	voices	off	to	the	left	and	torchlight	dancing</p>
<p class="calibre1">along	 the	 walls.	 To	 their	 right	 there	 was	 silence.	 In	 all	 the	 commotion,	 Riley couldn’t	be	sure	whether	it	was	left	or	right.	Which	way	led	back	to	their	point	of entry? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	caught	up	with	her	and	pointed	right	and	they	wasted	no	time	in	making	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	 to	 the	 way	 out	 through	 the	 maintenance	 area.	 They	 passed	 the	 machinery and	 out	 through	 the	 fire	 door,	 which	 hung	 broken	 on	 its	 top	 hinge.	 Stepping outside	into	the	cool	night	air,	it	was	pitch	black.	A	light	mist	hung	in	the	trees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	evening	dew	had	transformed	the	grassy	slope	ahead	of	them	into	a	sparkling</p>
<p class="calibre1">carpet	of	water	droplets	hanging	from	every	blade.	Out	here,	the	alarm	sounded</p>
<p class="calibre1">distant	 and	 strangely	 muted.	 Their	 eyes	 adjusted	 quickly	 to	 the	 darkness.	 They couldn’t	risk	using	one	of	the	torches	they	carried	as	it	would	only	reveal	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	pointed	towards	the	large	oak	tree	overhanging	the	fence.	Sean	reached</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 first	 but	 found	 the	 lowest	 branch	 was	 out	 of	 reach,	 almost	 ten	 feet	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>ground.	He	got	down	on	his	hands	and	knees	and	waited	for	Riley.	She	straddled his	shoulders	and	with	a	grunt	he	lifted	up.	Once	she’d	manoeuvred	herself	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 secure	 position,	 gripping	 the	 branch	 with	 her	 thighs,	 she	 reached	 down	 with her	 right	 hand	 and,	 with	 Sean’s	 help,	 she	 levered	 Adele	 and	 then	 Stella	 to	 join her.	Joe	was	next.	It	took	a	couple	of	attempts	before	Sean	took	a	deep	breath, </p>
<p class="calibre1">changed	 position	 and	 tried	 something	 different.	 Offering	 his	 cupped	 hands</p>
<p class="calibre1">instead,	 Sean	 braced	 with	 one	 knee	 and	 manhandled	 Joe	 high	 enough	 for	 the others	to	pull	him	up,	puffing	and	soaked	in	sweat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	the	others	shuffled	along	the	branch	and	over	the	fence	to	safety,	Riley</p>
<p class="calibre1">kept	watch	on	the	fire	door.	They	were	out	of	time.	In	the	distance,	near	the	front entrance,	 she	 could	 already	 see	 a	 small	 crowd	 gathering,	 squinting	 in	 to	 the darkness,	their	lanterns	held	high.	Mila	went	next,	which	just	left	Zed	and	Sean. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fire	door	to	the	hospital	burst	open	and	three	men	emerged	into	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beams	 of	 light	 from	 their	 powerful	 torches	 arced	 round	 in	 opposite	 directions trying	to	locate	the	Hurst	group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning	to	Zed,	Sean	insisted,	“You’re	first,	big	man.	With	that	busted	arm, </p>
<p class="calibre1">there’s	 no	 way	 you	 can	 pull	 yourself	 up	 on	 your	 own.	 We	 don’t	 have	 time	 to argue.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	leaving	you	behind,	Sean.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	lighter	and	I	can	jump	higher.	Come	on,	quickly.”	He	stooped	down	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">cupped	his	hands	together.	Zed	didn’t	like	it	but	Sean	was	right.	He	planted	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">right	 boot,	 and	 with	 one	 hand,	 he	 reached	 up	 as	 high	 as	 he	 could	 manage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Between	 Joe	 and	 Riley	 they	 heaved	 Zed’s	 large	 frame	 up	 and	 onto	 the	 branch, which	 creaked	 loudly	 under	 their	 combined	 weight.	 Zed	 gasped	 in	 pain	 as	 his body	weight	rested	briefly	on	his	busted	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	torches	flashed	up	to	their	position,	homing	in	on	the	noises,	and	two	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 men	 hurtled	 across	 the	 parking	 area	 towards	 them.	 A	 wild	 shot	 rang	 out, going	high	and	wide.	It	was	enough	to	get	the	rest	of	the	group	scurrying	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	urgency	along	the	branch	and	jumping	down	the	other	side	of	the	fence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sean	 stood	 underneath	 the	 branch	 swinging	 his	 arms,	 looking	 up	 hopefully, readying	himself	to	jump.	Riley	and	Joe	reached	down	as	far	as	they	could,	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">fingers	 splayed	 wide.	 Sean	 looked	 back	 over	 his	 shoulder	 at	 their	 pursuers.	 It was	now	or	never. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	leapt	as	high	as	he	could	but	only	managed	to	touch	fingers	with	Joe,	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t	 grab	 hold.	 He	 landed	 heavily	 and	 readied	 himself	 for	 another	 go.	 The armed	 men	 were	 close	 now	 and	 a	 volley	 of	 automatic	 fire	 peppered	 the	 tree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 and	 Joe	 lay	 flat	 against	 the	 branch	 and	 were	 unharmed.	 Adrenaline</p>
<p class="calibre1">pumping	 through	 his	 veins,	 Sean	 leapt	 as	 high	 as	 his	 tired	 legs	 would	 allow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	managed	to	grab	hold	of	his	wrist	as	Joe	reached	down	and	held	the	sleeve</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>of	his	jacket.	They	hoisted	him	up	slowly,	straining,	every	sinew	bursting.	Sean reached	up	and	got	a	hand	on	Joe’s	back,	a	smile	forming	on	his	face.	He	relaxed</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	a	fraction,	sensing	safety	within	his	grasp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	felt	Sean’s	whole	body	tense	as	a	shot	found	its	mark	in	his	lower	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 grip	 weakened	 and	 his	 arm	 went	 limp	 as	 his	 life	 force	 drained	 rapidly.	 As best	 they	 tried,	 they	 couldn’t	 pull	 him	 up.	 He	 became	 a	 dead	 weight	 in	 their hands.	 They	 tried	 one	 last	 time,	 but	 his	 eyes	 were	 closing	 and	 with	 a	 shriek	 of despair	from	Riley,	Sean’s	clammy	fingers	slipped	from	her	grasp	as	he	fell	on	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	grass	below.	His	limbs	crumpled	awkwardly	underneath	him,	lifeless.	Riley</p>
<p class="calibre1">stared	after	him,	shaking	her	head	in	disbelief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	gone,	Riley.	Come	on,”	shouted	Joe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	sobbing	lightly	and	he	had	to	drag	her	away.	Gunshots	splintered	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wood	over	their	heads	but	they	were	well	hidden	in	the	foliage.	Zed	stood	next	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 fence,	 his	 revolver	 raised,	 taking	 careful	 aim	 at	 the	 approaching	 group.	 He fired	a	single	shot	but	didn’t	stay	to	see	if	he’d	hit	his	target.	The	others	followed Zed	up	the	bank	and	away	to	their	rendezvous	point	in	the	dip	by	the	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	paused	on	the	crest	of	the	bank	and	counted	the	others	in.	As	they	passed</p>
<p class="calibre1">him,	he	put	his	hand	on	each	shoulder,	a	weak	smile	on	his	face	as	he	welcomed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	new	arrivals,	Stella	and	Adele.	Riley	was	the	last	to	arrive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	reached	out	to	pull	her	up	the	bank,	but	she	ignored	his	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	touch	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shrugged	and	took	one	last	look	at	the	hospital	before	turning	away.	Their</p>
<p class="calibre1">pursuers	 hadn’t	 tried	 to	 follow	 them	 over	 the	 fence,	 but	 he	 could	 be	 sure	 they would	 assemble	 a	 search	 party	 to	 hunt	 them	 down	 at	 first	 light.	 There	 was	 no time	to	waste. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Twenty-five</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Will’s	eyes	flickered	open	and	he	sat	bolt	upright,	gathering	his	senses.	The	fire</p>
<p class="calibre1">alarm	was	real,	not	part	of	his	restless	dream.	It	must	be	running	off	a	back-up</p>
<p class="calibre1">system.	There	was	a	commotion	outside	his	room.	He	was	still	handcuffed	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bedpost,	but	stood	up	as	best	he	could,	straining	to	hear	the	raised	voices	outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	it	was	a	fire,	someone	would	come	and	let	him	out.	They	wouldn’t	just	leave</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	in	here,	would	they?	Unless	someone	had	deliberately	activated	the	alarm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	tried	to	ease	the	handcuffs	over	his	balled	fist,	but	it	was	no	good.	He	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">tried	a	hundred	times	already.	How	did	they	manage	it	in	the	movies?	Was	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 trick	 to	 it?	 He	 spent	 a	 couple	 of	 minutes	 hawking	 up	 some	 spit	 from	 an otherwise	 parched	 mouth	 and	 throat.	 He	 spat	 on	 his	 wrists	 for	 lubrication,	 but however	he	contorted	his	thumb	and	fingers,	the	result	was	the	same.	His	thumbs</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	red	raw	from	his	repeated	efforts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Footsteps	 in	 the	 corridor	 were	 followed	 by	 the	 familiar	 jangle	 of	 keys.	 The handle	turned	slowly	and	the	door	was	flung	open.	The	shrill	wail	of	the	alarm</p>
<p class="calibre1">alternated	 pitch	 every	 second.	 He	 shielded	 one	 side	 of	 his	 head	 with	 his	 free hand.	 Three	 men	 surged	 into	 the	 room.	 The	 first	 had	 a	 swagger	 about	 him,	 an automatic	rifle	held	at	the	stock,	pointing	towards	the	ceiling.	Behind	him	stood</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	man	in	black.	He	pushed	the	door	closed,	his	head	cocked	to	the	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks	 like	 your	 friends	 from	 Hurst	 have	 come	 to	 rescue	 you.	 Shame	 they won’t	find	you,”	he	mocked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	henchmen	laughed	sycophantically.	The	thug	at	the	rear	of	the	group</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	on	menacingly,	chewing	gum,	with	a	fixed	snarl	on	his	face.	He	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	a	down-on-his-luck	bouncer	from	an	after-hours	club.	He	was	dressed	head</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 toe	 in	 paramilitary	 black.	 They	 all	 were.	 Perhaps	 it	 was	 the	 fashion	 round these	parts.	Paramilitary	black	was	the	“new	black”. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	thuggish	man’s	cold	impassive	eyes	stared	straight	through	Will	as	if	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t	there.	On	his	shoulder	was	a	discoloured	patch	where	an	epaulette	or	rank</p>
<p class="calibre1">insignia	 would	 have	 normally	 been.	 This	 had	 to	 be	 the	 man	 they	 called</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Copper”,	 though	 he’d	 never	 seen	 his	 face	 until	 now.	 He	 was	 barrel-chested, with	a	thick	neck,	the	hint	of	a	colourful	tattoo	just	visible	above	the	collar	and heavy	 stubble	 on	 his	 chin	 that	 had	 been	 shaped	 into	 a	 goatee.	 He	 shaved	 his scalp	to	within	a	millimetre.	Will	could	smell	the	man	from	where	he	sat.	There</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>was	a	heady	blend	of	sweat,	alcohol	and	unbridled	aggression.	He	was	a	powder keg	 of	 testosterone	 with	 a	 short	 fuse,	 just	 ready	 to	 go	 off.	 The	 back	 of	 Will’s neck	throbbed	as	a	timely	reminder	of	why	not	to	provoke	a	psychopath	without</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 your	 friends	 have	 made	 a	 wasted	 journey.	 They	 won’t	 find	 you	 up</p>
<p class="calibre1">here.	They’re	looking	in	the	wrong	place,	for	starters.	Don’t	worry,	Will.	We’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">catch	 them,	 that’s	 what	 these	 guys	 do,	 catch	 people.	 Isn’t	 that	 right,	 Copper? </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’ll	hunt	them	down	wherever	they’re	hiding.	And	when	we	do,	we’ll	send</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	back	to	Hurst	in	pieces.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	struck	Will	that	the	man	in	black	was	trying	just	a	little	too	hard.	Trying	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">appear	 tough	 and	 ruthless.	 Playing	 a	 part	 and	 living	 up	 to	 the	 expectations	 of those	around	him,	but	not	altogether	convincingly.	He	tried	to	imagine	what	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	 might	 have	 been	 before	 the	 breakdown,	 before	 the	 world	 had	 collapsed	 in short	order,	like	a	house	of	cards.	He	imagined	a	downtrodden	middle	manager</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	a	regional	sales	office.	Years	of	frustration	heaped	upon	him,	of	being	talked</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	 to.	 A	 broken	 family.	 Absent	 parents.	 A	 messy	 divorce.	 Children	 taken away	from	him	by	court	order.	A	lifetime	of	bitterness	and	disappointments	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 led	 to	 this	 point:	 the	 birth	 of	 a	 sociopath.	 Will	 pitied	 and	 despised	 him	 in equal	 measure.	 Wasn’t	 he	 just	 the	 product	 of	 a	 dysfunctional	 society,	 one	 that had	deserved	to	collapse?	Or	maybe	he	was	just	born	an	evil	bastard.	Nature	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">nurture,	he	wasn’t	sure	which. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	in	black	half	turned	towards	Copper,	but	didn’t	look	directly	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take	your	squad	and	go	set	up	a	little	surprise	party	for	them.	A	roadblock</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	main	road.	Don't	bother	bringing	me	prisoners.	I	want	them	all	dead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	got	it.”	Copper	turned	and	left	with	a	final	dead-eyed	glance	at	Will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	he	really	likes	you,”	said	the	man	in	black.	“I	think	he’s	dreaming	up	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fitting	demise.	Something	truly	monstrous	for	you	when	your	time	comes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	I’m	saving	something	special	for	him	too.”	Will	blew	him	a	kiss,	but	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	too	late.	Copper	didn’t	look	round	and	kept	walking	out	the	door	and	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	corridor,	his	rifle	slung	over	the	shoulder	at	his	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	not	learning,	are	you?	Didn’t	we	teach	you	some	manners	last	time?	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	forgive	rudeness	once,	but	if	it’s	repeated,	well,	then…”	He	wandered	closer</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	caressed	the	back	of	Will’s	head,	lingering	around	the	fresh	dressing	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 already	 stained	 a	 light	 brown.	 He	 pressed	 his	 fingers	 into	 the	 wound, enjoying	Will’s	discomfort.	“We	wouldn’t	want	those	stitches	opening	up	again, </p>
<p class="calibre1">would	we?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 grabbed	 a	 fistful	 of	 Will’s	 hair	 and	 jerked	 his	 head	 backwards.	 Will looked	 up	 undaunted	 as	 the	 man	 in	 black	 sneered.	 “You	 people	 are	 pathetic, holed	 up	 in	 that	 big	 castle,	 cowering	 behind	 your	 high	 walls.	 You	 really	 think</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a>they’re	going	to	stop	my	men	from	barging	in	there	and	taking	it	for	ourselves? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve	 always	 fancied	 myself	 living	 in	 a	 castle.	 Perhaps	 I’ll	 choose	 a	 wife	 from your	group,	eh?	Or	maybe	I’ll	just	slaughter	the	whole	lot	of	them.”	He	pointed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 handcuffs	 and	 gestured	 to	 the	 other	 man.	 “Unlock	 him	 from	 the	 bed	 but keep	the	cuffs	on.	We’re	going	for	a	little	drive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you’re	going	to	try	and	make	me	talk	about	Hurst	again,	forget	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	need.	You	told	us	everything	we	need	to	know,	not	that	you’d	remember. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	doctors	here	injected	you	with	a	potent	cocktail	of	drugs	that	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 made	 a	 condemned	 man	 sing	 like	 a	 canary.	 Let’s	 just	 say	 you	 were	 more than	helpful.	I’ll	be	sure	to	tell	all	your	friends	before	I	kill	them	that	you	were the	one	who	gave	up	all	of	Hurst’s	secrets.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	looked	confused.	He	had	absolutely	no	memory	of	what	he’d	said,	but	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 back	 of	 his	 mind,	 he	 was	 beginning	 to	 think	 he’d	 told	 them	 exactly	 what they’d	 wanted	 to	 know.	 He	 knew	 Hurst’s	 defences	 like	 the	 back	 of	 his	 hand, having	 repaired	 walls,	 fixed	 drains	 and	 leaking	 roofs,	 even	 fortified	 doorways over	the	last	few	weeks.	There	were	a	couple	of	places	where,	with	a	grappling</p>
<p class="calibre1">hook	and	some	climbing	skills,	you	could	get	over	the	castle	walls	unseen.	Once</p>
<p class="calibre1">inside	 the	 main	 wall,	 a	 single	 person	 could	 get	 in	 and	 open	 the	 main	 gate	 to	 a larger	 force.	 There	 were	 only	 ever	 a	 couple	 of	 guards	 at	 night,	 a	 single	 patrol every	 hour.	 The	 castle	 would	 fall.	 There	 was	 no	 question.	 Unless.	 Unless	 he could	 get	 a	 message	 to	 them	 first	 and	 make	 sure	 they	 were	 ready	 to	 repel	 the attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whatever	you	think	you	found	out,	whatever	you	think	I	told	you,	you	don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">stand	a	chance.	Your	plan	will	never	work.	Hurst	has	never	fallen	in	more	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">five	hundred	years.	It’s	a	fortress.	Don’t	go	thinking	you	can	just	waltz	in	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	everyone	will	lay	down	their	arms	and	surrender.	They’ll	fight	to	the	death</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	protect	what’s	theirs.	I	can	assure	you,	they’re	heavily	armed	and	the	castle	is well	defended.	Your	men	will	die	and	you	will	lose.	My	life	is	unimportant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 in	 black	 was	 puzzled	 by	 Will’s	 bravado.	 He	 studied	 the	 side	 of Will’s	head,	leaning	closer.	There	was	almost	a	tenderness	to	his	voice.	“I	admire</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	 spirit,	 Will,	 really	 I	 do.	 In	 fact,	 that’s	 exactly	 why	 you’ll	 be	 my	 personal guide.	I	want	you	to	see	the	whole	thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	heard	footsteps	in	the	hall.	A	man	in	a	white	coat	was	running	down	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">long	hallway	towards	them.	It	was	the	same	Indian	doctor	who	had	treated	Will</p>
<p class="calibre1">earlier.	The	guard	stepped	into	his	path,	blocking	the	doorway	and	motioned	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	to	slow	down.	Raj	skidded	to	a	halt,	bent	over,	hands	on	knees,	just	outside</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 door,	 trying	 to	 get	 his	 breath.	 Just	 then	 the	 alarm	 fell	 silent	 and	 a	 sense	 of normality	returned.	The	guard	glanced	at	the	man	in	black,	who	nodded,	and	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">stepped	aside	to	allow	the	doctor	to	pass. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>“The	girls	are	gone,”	said	Raj,	his	voice	trembling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	girls?”	asked	the	man	in	black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	test	subjects	for	the	clinical	trials.	Adele	and	Stella.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	weren’t	they	locked	up	like	the	rest	of	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Raj	 looked	 uneasy,	 unsure	 how	 to	 respond.	 “Perhaps	 the	 guards	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">listening	to	your	address,	like	the	rest	of	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Amateurs,”	he	spat	in	disgust.	“How	many	times	have	I	told	them?”	He	ran</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	fingers	threw	his	hair,	and	scratched	the	back	of	his	neck,	lost	in	thought	for	a few	seconds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	 seized	 on	 this	 setback.	 “What’s	 so	 special	 about	 those	 girls?	 You	 have hundreds	of	prisoners	here.	Why	them?”	he	asked	provocatively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 whipped	 around	 in	 a	 flash.	 He	 drew	 a	 knife	 and	 held	 it	 to	 Will’s throat.	The	blade	nicked	the	skin	so	that	a	tiny	pinprick	of	blood	trickled	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	have	something	to	do	with	this?	We	thought	they	were	here	for	you, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	perhaps	you	were	the	diversion	all	along.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	shook	his	head,	breathing	heavily,	leaning	his	head	away	from	the	point</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	blade.	“I	assure	you,	I	had	nothing	to	do	with	this,”	he	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	in	black	slapped	Will	hard	across	the	face	with	the	back	of	his	hand, </p>
<p class="calibre1">knocking	 him	 backwards	 on	 to	 the	 bed.	 Turning	 back	 to	 face	 the	 guard	 and doctor,	his	face	was	red,	his	throat	and	chest	blotchy	with	rage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Those	girls	are	critical	to	our	research.	We’ve	got	to	find	them.	Do	whatever</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	takes!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	 worry,	 sir,	 we’ll	 get	 them	 back.	 We	 know	 where	 they’re	 heading	 at least,”	said	the	henchmen,	attempting	to	calm	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	 can’t	 have	 any	 idea	 how	 important	 those	 girls	 are	 to	 our	 research,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">added	the	doctor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hurst	will	pay	for	this,”	swore	the	man	in	black. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Twenty-six</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 Stella’s	 idea	 to	 head	 to	 New	 Milton.	 They	 couldn’t	 risk	 going	 back	 to Hurst	 that	 night.	 Chances	 were	 their	 pursuers	 would	 try	 to	 follow	 them,	 or worse,	 set	 an	 ambush.	 Now	 they	 all	 knew	 full	 well	 what	 “being	 a	 prisoner” </p>
<p class="calibre1">really	 meant	 at	 the	 hospital,	 none	 of	 them	 wanted	 to	 see	 the	 place	 again.	 New Milton	 was	 as	 good	 a	 route	 as	 any.	 It	 was	 a	 longer	 way	 round,	 but	 the	 road through	the	forest	would	be	deserted	and	safe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stella	 sat	 in	 the	 back	 seat	 of	 the	 Land	 Rover	 Defender	 with	 Mila’s	 head cradled	in	her	lap.	Mila	was	inconsolable	at	having	left	Sean	behind.	Every	few</p>
<p class="calibre1">minutes	she	repeated,	“I	can’t	believe	he’s	gone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stella’s	 own	 relief	 at	 escaping	 the	 clutches	 of	 her	 captors	 had	 given	 way	 to what	Riley	said	was	post-traumatic	shock.	As	a	precautionary	measure,	Stella’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind	seemed	to	have	disconnected	itself	from	the	vivid	memories	of	her	ordeal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	a	semi-catatonic	state	she	mechanically	stroked	Mila’s	hair,	staring	unblinking</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	 of	 the	 passenger	 window.	 She	 gave	 no	 indication	 that	 she	 was	 listening	 as they	 replayed	 every	 moment	 of	 their	 escape	 and	 debated	 their	 options	 for	 the night.	Staying	out	in	the	open	was	high-risk.	They	could	break	into	a	farmhouse</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	 the	 main	 road	 and	 hope	 it	 was	 unoccupied,	 or	 drive	 through	 the	 night	 on unfamiliar	roads	to	make	it	back	for	dawn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chewton	Glen.”	Stella’s	voice	startled	them	and	they	all	looked	round. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	mean	 <i class="calibre4">the</i>	Chewton	Glen?”	asked	Riley.	“It’s	a	big	country	hotel	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">far	from	here.	Is	that	the	one	you	were	staying	at	before	you	were	caught?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stella	 nodded,	 avoiding	 eye	 contact,	 preferring	 to	 look	 out	 the	 window	 into the	 forest.	 “They’re	 good	 people.	 They	 know	 me.	 We’ll	 be	 safe	 there.	 They’ll take	us	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	looked	at	Riley	and	Joe	who	both	nodded.	No	one	had	a	better	plan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Works	for	me,”	said	Joe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 drove	 in	 silence,	 hunched	 over	 the	 wheel	 trying	 to	 see	 where	 he	 was going	in	near	darkness.	He	couldn’t	risk	headlights,	but	a	crescent	moon	cast	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">pale	light	where	it	pierced	the	tree	canopy.	The	Land	Rover	bumped	along	at	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">slow	crawl,	heading	away	from	Lymington.	He	found	his	eyes	adjusted	quickly</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	if	he	took	it	really	slow	then	driving	in	the	dark	was	just	about	manageable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	a	couple	of	places	the	road	surface	had	been	washed	away	or	badly	broken	up</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>by	 tree	 roots.	 Several	 fallen	 trees	 blocked	 their	 route,	 but	 they	 were	 able	 to	 go round	 them	 where	 the	 forest	 floor	 was	 dry	 and	 firm.	 In	 a	 few	 more	 years,	 this whole	 heavily	 wooded	 section	 might	 be	 completely	 impassable.	 Littered	 with fallen	branches	and	storm	debris,	it	already	looked	more	like	a	farm	track	than	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">major	highway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	past	midnight	and	while	the	rest	of	them	dozed	in	the	back,	Zed	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	took	it	in	turns	to	drive.	Travelling	at	walking	pace,	it	took	them	more	than an	hour	to	reach	the	outskirts	of	New	Milton.	They	skirted	the	main	town	centre, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sticking	 to	 smaller	 country	 lanes,	 completely	 deserted	 as	 they	 had	 hoped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Approaching	 New	 Milton	 from	 the	 west,	 Zed	 stopped	 the	 car	 in	 the	 middle	 of the	 road	 by	 a	 small	 bridge	 over	 a	 brook	 and	 switched	 off	 the	 engine.	 In	 the silence,	they	could	hear	the	sounds	of	the	stream	and	a	light	breeze	that	made	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tall	 trees	 to	 their	 right	 sway	 gently.	 They	 were	 not	 far	 from	 the	 entrance	 to	 the hotel,	and	Zed	put	his	hand	on	Stella’s	shoulder	to	wake	her.	She	startled,	crying</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	in	alarm	before	remembering	where	she	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	we	there	already?”	Stella	looked	around	her	in	the	darkness,	but	didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	anything	she	recognised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Christchurch	Road	entrance	is	just	up	here	on	the	left,”	he	said,	pointing</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	the	roadway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	 do	 you	 want	 to	 play	 this,	 Stella?	 We	 don’t	 want	 to	 go	 surprising</p>
<p class="calibre1">anyone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	turn	your	lights	on	and	approach	the	gate	so	they	know	you’re	coming,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said	Stella	naively	as	if	it	was	the	most	normal	thing	in	the	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,	that	might	work,”	said	Riley	sarcastically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stella	stared	back	at	her,	puzzled.	“Why	wouldn’t	it?	Isn’t	that	what	normal</p>
<p class="calibre1">people	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	shrugged	and	nodded	at	Zed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	you	know	these	people.	Let’s	do	it	your	way	and	see	what	happens.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 sounded	 exhausted.	 He’d	 lost	 a	 lot	 of	 blood	 and	 was	 struggling	 to	 stay awake.	 The	 thought	 of	 a	 good	 meal	 and	 a	 bed	 for	 the	 night	 sounded	 worth	 the risk.	 “But	 if	 this	 doesn’t	 work,	 let’s	 make	 sure	 we’re	 ready	 to	 return	 fire	 and hightail	it	out	of	here,	yeah?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These	 are	 my	 friends,”	 reassured	 Stella,	 who	 seemed	 to	 have	 perked	 up	 a bit,	so	close	to	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 powered	 up	 the	 spotlights	 mounted	 on	 the	 roof	 of	 the	 Land	 Rover	 to ensure	even	a	half-blind	person	would	see	them	coming.	He	revved	the	engine	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">couple	 of	 times,	 its	 diesel	 notes	 straining	 and	 insistent,	 just	 to	 make	 sure	 they could	hear	them	too.	Stella	leaned	forward	in	her	seat,	recognising	the	high	brick</p>
<p class="calibre1">wall	that	surrounded	the	stately	grounds	to	her	former	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>A	large	grey	delivery	truck	was	parked	in	front	of	the	main	gates,	completely blocking	 the	 way	 in.	 Zed	 left	 the	 engine	 running	 and	 half	 opened	 his	 door peering	out	to	see	if	there	was	anyone	around.	The	entrance	looked	disused	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 was	 about	 to	 suggest	 they	 try	 the	 other	 entrance	 when	 he	 got	 the	 distinct impression	they	were	being	watched.	A	powerful	searchlight	clicked	on,	nearly</p>
<p class="calibre1">blinding	 everyone	 in	 the	 Land	 Rover.	 The	 passengers	 sat	 shielding	 their	 eyes with	their	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	female	voice	on	a	megaphone	cleared	her	throat	and	instructed	them	to	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	 of	 the	 car.	 The	 four	 doors	 opened	 wide,	 and	 very	 slowly	 Zed	 and	 Riley stepped	 away	 from	 the	 protection	 offered	 by	 the	 door.	 They	 squinted	 into	 the light,	hands	above	their	heads,	trying	to	make	out	the	silhouette	of	a	person	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">top	of	the	truck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 rear	 passenger	 door	 opened	 and	 Stella	 jumped	 out	 with	 a	 big	 smile</p>
<p class="calibre1">spreading	across	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that	you,	Stella?	You	have	got	to	be	kidding,”	said	the	surprised	voice	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	megaphone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stella	could	barely	contain	her	excitement,	hopping	from	foot	to	foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	made	it	back.	I	don’t	believe	it.	We	thought	you	were	dead.	Wait,	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	the	others?	Are	Tabs	and	Martha	with	you	too?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stella	 shook	 her	 head.	 “They’re	 still	 at	 the	 hospital.	 They	 captured	 us	 a couple	 of	 weeks	 back.	 Four	 guys	 jumped	 us.	 These	 guys	 got	 me	 out	 and	 we came	straight	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 searchlight	 powered	 down	 and	 for	 a	 moment	 the	 entrance	 plunged	 into</p>
<p class="calibre1">semi-darkness	 again	 before	 some	 lower	 level	 sodium	 flood	 lights	 flickered	 on, bathing	the	group	in	a	soft	orange	glow.	The	woman	disappeared	from	view	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	climbed	down	the	back	of	the	truck,	squeezed	through	a	small	gap	between</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	wall	and	the	bumper	and	strode	over	to	Stella.	Standing	a	few	feet	apart	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	her	up	and	down	before	throwing	her	arms	round	her.	“It’s	so	good	to	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">you.	 Welcome	 back,	 girl.”	 She	 slapped	 her	 a	 few	 times	 on	 the	 back	 for	 good measure.	They	did	a	little	dance	together,	jumping	up	and	down,	clutching	each</p>
<p class="calibre1">other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,	Mary.	These	are	my	friends.	Joe,	Zed,	Riley,	Mila	and	the	little	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	is	Adele.	They	rescued	me.	I	promised	them	shelter	for	the	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary	strode	over	to	the	rest	of	the	group	and	shook	each	of	their	hands.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">warmth	 of	 her	 welcome	 cooled	 somewhat	 when	 it	 came	 to	 Zed	 and	 Joe.	 She looked	 them	 up	 and	 down	 and	 shook	 her	 head.	 “The	 boss	 ain’t	 gonna	 like	 you being	here.	Let’s	leave	that	till	the	morning.	Any	friend	of	Stella’s	is	a	friend	of mine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	fished	the	keys	to	the	truck	out	of	her	breast	pocket	and	climbed	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>cab	to	move	it	out	of	the	way.	Winding	down	the	window,	she	shouted	over	the noise	of	the	engine	starting	up.	“I’ll	meet	you	by	the	main	entrance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	truck	rolled	a	few	yards	back,	just	wide	enough	to	allow	the	Land	Rover</p>
<p class="calibre1">through.	Mary	leaned	out	of	the	window	and	waved	them	through.	Zed	headed</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	the	long	gravel	drive	towards	the	main	hotel	building	in	front	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	figures	stood	warming	their	hands	in	the	cold	night	air,	rifles	slung	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	shoulders.	One	wore	a	long	winter	coat	and	a	beanie	hat,	with	leggings	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">trainers.	 The	 other	 had	 a	 Russian-style	 fur	 hat	 with	 flaps	 covering	 her	 ears.	 It was	nearing	the	end	of	their	shift	and	they	both	looked	chilled	to	the	bone.	It	was still	 very	 early.	 They	 paced	 around,	 stamping	 their	 feet,	 waiting	 for	 the	 Hurst group	to	unload	their	rucksacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	get	you	inside	before	we	all	freeze	to	death,”	said	the	girl	in	the	fur	hat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Emily	will	find	you	a	place	to	sleep	for	tonight.”	She	looked	back	at	Zed	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">mild	 surprise,	 like	 she	 hadn’t	 seen	 a	 man	 in	 a	 long	 time.	 “You’ll	 need	 to surrender	those	weapons.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside	 they	 stood	 next	 to	 the	 reception	 desk	 lit	 by	 a	 large	 kerosene	 lamp, waiting	to	be	patted	down.	When	it	was	Riley’s	turn,	the	sheer	volume	of	knives</p>
<p class="calibre1">secreted	 about	 her	 person	 raised	 eyebrows.	 For	 the	 first	 time	 in	 as	 long	 as	 she could	 remember	 she	 felt	 naked	 without	 a	 weapon,	 other	 than	 a	 small	 blade hidden	behind	her	belt	buckle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stella	 led	 the	 group	 through	 the	 hotel,	 holding	 high	 a	 Tilley	 lantern	 to	 light their	way	to	an	extravagantly	furnished	drawing	room	hung	with	gilded	framed</p>
<p class="calibre1">paintings	 showing	 Victorian	 watercolour	 scenes.	 Zed	 collapsed	 on	 the	 nearest leather	 sofa	 and	 swung	 his	 legs	 up,	 not	 even	 bothering	 to	 unlace	 his	 boots.	 He was	dead	on	his	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stella	 handed	 Riley	 the	 lantern	 together	 with	 a	 pile	 of	 folded	 grey	 blankets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	see	you	all	in	the	morning	for	breakfast.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	not	staying	with	us?”	asked	Adele. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	 tonight.	 I’ve	 got	 a	 lot	 of	 catching	 up	 to	 do.	 You’ll	 be	 fine	 here.	 Sleep well,”	said	Stella,	before	turning	to	leave,	locking	the	door	behind	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 shrugged.	 Perhaps	 it	 was	 just	 a	 precaution	 to	 stop	 them	 roaming	 the hotel	in	the	night.	She	draped	a	blanket	over	Zed	who	was	already	snoring,	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mouth	 open,	 and	 bedded	 down	 for	 the	 night	 in	 an	 armchair.	 She	 pulled	 the blanket	up	around	her	chin	and	was	asleep	within	seconds. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Twenty-seven</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	was	the	first	awake.	She	watched	the	others	sleeping,	enjoying	the	silence</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	sunshine	streaming	through	the	window.	Mila	looked	so	peaceful,	curled</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	 in	 a	 ball	 in	 the	 corner.	 Riley’s	 attention	 flicked	 back	 to	 Zed,	 his	 forehead damp	 with	 perspiration.	 With	 a	 sharp	 intake	 of	 breath,	 Adele	 sat	 up,	 her	 eyes wild. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bad	dream?”	asked	Riley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Every	night,	I	have	the	same	dream,”	replied	Adele,	blushing	as	if	this	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	admission	of	weakness.	“I	always	wake	up	just	as	I’m	about	to	find	out	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">happens.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	frustrating.	What’s	the	dream	about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	my	dream	I	can	fly,	soaring	above	a	city,	reaching	out	to	touch	the	clouds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 swoop	 down	 just	 above	 the	 rooftops,	 skimming	 the	 grass,	 dancing	 in	 the	 air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 all	 these	 people	 start	 coming	 out	 of	 the	 houses.	 Families	 and	 children pointing	up	at	me,	laughing.	It’s	like	all	their	prayers	have	been	answered.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	 this	 fire	 starts	 burning	 me	 up	 from	 inside	 and	 I’m	 being	 pulled	 towards	 a black	hole	in	the	sky.	I	have	no	way	of	stopping	it.”	There	was	a	pained	look	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Adele’s	 face	 as	 if	 she	 was	 still	 troubled	 by	 the	 vivid	 images	 intruding	 into	 her waking	thoughts.	“What	do	you	think	it	means?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dreams	 are	 funny	 things.”	 Riley	 shrugged.	 “They’re	 your	 subconscious</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind	 making	 sense	 of	 what’s	 been	 going	 on,	 replaying	 images,	 sounds,	 things that	 troubled	 you.	 Remember,	 you’ve	 seen	 a	 lot	 of	 weird	 stuff	 for	 someone	 so young.	 Your	 time	 in	 the	 hospital,	 the	 drugs	 they	 were	 giving	 you,	 maybe	 even what	happened	to	your	family	during	the	outbreak.	Heck,	I	wouldn’t	worry	too</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	about	it.	We	all	have	bad	dreams	from	time	to	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 a	 momentary	 look	 of	 alarm	 as	 Adele	 hunted	 for	 something	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	no	longer	in	her	pocket.	Searching	around	her	in	the	folds	of	the	blanket,	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">found	a	treasured	memento	of	home	and	family.	She	clutched	the	key	ring	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shape	of	a	rabbit’s	foot	to	her	breast,	closing	her	eyes	and	mouthing	a	few	words</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 gratitude,	 before	 inserting	 it	 deep	 into	 a	 jean	 pocket	 for	 safe	 keeping.	 Riley looked	over	at	Zed	who	was	still	dead	to	the	world,	but	the	others	were	stirring, </p>
<p class="calibre1">yawning	and	stretching,	taking	in	their	unfamiliar	surroundings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking	 outside,	 a	 flower	 bed	 ran	 directly	 beneath	 the	 window.	 Pink	 roses</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>brushed	 against	 the	 lower	 half	 of	 the	 glass.	 There	 was	 a	 red	 dawn,	 scattered clouds	 hurrying	 across	 the	 horizon.	 Was	 red	 sky	 a	 good	 or	 bad	 omen?	 Riley could	never	remember. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	quick-fire	rap	at	the	door.	Adele	was	there	first.	She	rattled	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">round	brass	handle	but	found	it	locked.	Stella’s	voice	from	the	outside	sounded</p>
<p class="calibre1">flustered	 and	 told	 them	 to	 stay	 put	 while	 she	 ran	 back	 to	 grab	 the	 key	 from reception.	 The	 white	 panelled	 door	 swung	 inwards	 to	 reveal	 Stella	 standing there,	 smiling.	 She	 picked	 Adele	 up	 off	 the	 floor	 and	 hugged	 her	 tightly	 while apologising	to	the	group	for	locking	them	in	overnight.	The	sisters	who	ran	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">place	were	very	particular	about	their	rules,	she	explained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stella	showed	them	to	a	large	bathroom	on	the	ground	floor	where	there	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 chemical	 toilet,	 buckets	 of	 fresh	 water	 from	 the	 stream	 and	 towels	 that	 were clean	if	not	exactly	fluffy	by	hotel	standards.	The	Hurst	group	took	it	in	turns	to wash,	relaxed	in	each	other’s	company.	Joe	averted	his	gaze	as	Mila	stripped	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 underwear.	 Riley	 unwrapped	 a	 bar	 of	 lavender	 soap,	 releasing	 the	 sweet smell	 from	 its	 waxy	 cover,	 stopping	 to	 inhale	 the	 fragrance.	 It	 had	 been	 some time	since	she’d	smelled	anything	so	delicious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	they	all	had	finished	scrubbing	their	hands	and	faces,	Riley	dressed	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	same	clothes,	stiff	and	scratchy	against	her	skin.	They	trooped	back	out	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 hallway	 where	 Stella	 was	 waiting	 to	 take	 them	 to	 the	 main	 dining	 room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There,	they	found	almost	a	hundred	people	eating	their	breakfast,	tightly	packed</p>
<p class="calibre1">together	at	tables	set	for	four	or	eight	diners.	Something	seemed	odd	to	Riley	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	squeezed	between	chairs.	All	the	eyes	in	the	room	followed	their	progress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	room	fell	quickly	silent.	One	person	dropped	a	knife	clattering	onto	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">floor,	but	didn’t	reach	to	pick	it	up,	a	look	of	surprise	frozen	on	her	face.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	to	be	staring	at	Zed	and	Joe	in	particular.	Riley	was	puzzled.	Had	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	seen	strangers	before? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stella	 knocked	 at	 a	 door	 with	 a	 frosted	 glass	 panel	 that	 led	 into	 a	 private dining	 room.	 Warm	 sunlight	 bathed	 this	 end	 of	 the	 hall	 which	 looked	 out	 over orderly,	well-maintained	flower	beds	bordering	freshly	mowed	lawns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 the	 opposite	 side	 of	 the	 table	 facing	 the	 door	 they	 found	 the	 Mother Superior	Stella	had	warned	them	about.	The	description	was	spot	on.	She	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">formidable	 woman	 with	 a	 handsome	 face,	 that	 some	 might	 say	 was	 a	 little	 too masculine,	 long	 and	 angular.	 The	 sister	 reminded	 Riley	 of	 Princess	 Anne.	 At either	 side	 sat	 two	 nuns,	 studying	 each	 of	 them	 carefully.	 Sister	 Theodora	 was conservatively	dressed	in	a	spotless	black	habit	and	white	wimple.	She	held	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">head	 high,	 peering	 through	 glasses	 perched	 on	 the	 end	 of	 her	 nose.	 Her	 thin, almost	colourless,	lips	were	expressionless	as	she	waited	for	the	group	to	settle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	noticed	clear	intelligent	blue	eyes	that	would	once	have	been	striking.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>found	herself	staring	at	a	wart	on	the	Mother	Superior’s	forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	Stella.	That	will	be	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stella	paused	as	if	she	had	expected	to	stay	with	her	new	friends.	She	smiled</p>
<p class="calibre1">weakly	at	the	group,	did	an	odd	sort	of	curtsy	and	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	 have	 a	 seat.”	 She	 gestured	 to	 the	 six	 seats	 facing	 her.	 “Do	 help yourself	to	coffee.”	She	slowly	stretched	out	her	hand	to	extend	their	hospitality</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	new	arrivals.	“There	is	milk,	flatbread,	apples	and	pears	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	waited	for	them	to	take	their	seats	before	continuing.	“Stella	tells	me	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">owe	 you	 a	 debt	 of	 gratitude	 for	 returning	 her	 to	 us.	 For	 that	 we	 thank	 you.	 As I’m	 sure	 you	 can	 imagine,	 we	 are	 not	 accustomed	 to	 receiving	 strangers	 in	 the dead	of	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	watched	in	silence	as	the	group	gave	in	to	their	hunger.	They	devoured</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	flat	bread	and	fruit,	their	first	meal	in	nearly	twenty-four	hours.	When	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	nothing	left,	they	slumped	back	in	their	chairs,	satiated.	Joe	wiped	his	face</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 a	 frayed	 sleeve	 where	 juice	 and	 milk	 had	 dribbled	 down	 his	 chin	 into	 the folds	of	his	neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sister	Theodora	leaned	forward,	demanding	their	full	attention.	“Now	I	want</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	be	perfectly	clear.	In	these	unusual	circumstances,	we	have	bent	our	rules	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">give	you	food	and	accommodation	before	you	head	back	to	Hurst	Castle.	Stella</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	course	stays	with	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 frowned	 at	 Riley,	 puzzled	 by	 her	 choice	 of	 words.	 “That’s	 up	 to	 Stella, don’t	you	think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sister	ignored	Zed	and	continued	to	address	Riley.	“The	rest	of	you	ladies</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	most	welcome	to	stay.	You	will	find	that	we	are	mostly	self-sufficient.”	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">smiled	 her	 best,	 most	 welcoming	 smile.	 “The	 local	 stream	 provides	 us	 with unlimited	 drinking	 water.	 We	 have	 a	 small	 generator	 for	 electric	 lights	 in	 the winter.	 As	 for	 food,	 we	 grow	 our	 own	 vegetables	 and	 have	 cows,	 chicken	 and sheep.	 We	 even	 have	 a	 swimming	 pool	 we	 fill	 in	 the	 summer.	 Here	 at	 the Chewton	 Glen,	 our	 residents	 are	 free	 from	 the	 worst	 excesses	 of	 man	 and	 the evil	he	has	brought	upon	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	blinked,	her	eyes	narrowing,	not	entirely	sure	she	had	heard	the	sister</p>
<p class="calibre1">correctly.	 “Wait,	 you	 said	 only	 the	 women	 were	 welcome	 to	 stay.	 What	 about these	two?	Are	they	not	welcome?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sister	cleared	her	throat,	her	eyes	remained	fixed	on	Riley,	piercing	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">cold.	 “Oh	 dear.	 Perhaps	 Stella	 did	 not	 explain.	 This	 is	 a	 sanctuary	 for	 women. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	do	not	usually	allow	men	here	at	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Since	when	did	men	become	the	root	of	all	evil?”	asked	Zed	accusingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sister	laughed,	seemingly	amused	by	the	naivety	of	the	question.	“Since</p>
<p class="calibre1">men	 began	 subjugating	 women	 to	 their	 will.	 Since	 the	 dawn	 of	 time.	 Since</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>Adam	 corrupted	 Eve.	 We	 have	 chosen	 a	 life	 free	 from	 violence,	 brutality,	 rape and	murder.	Men	have	no	place	in	our	lives	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	nuns	on	either	side	nodded	their	approval,	but	remained	silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	while	men,	women	and	children	are	dying	in	their	millions	outside	these</p>
<p class="calibre1">walls,	 you	 dare	 pass	 judgement	 on	 half	 the	 population?”	 continued	 Zed</p>
<p class="calibre1">incredulously.	 He	 rose	 unsteadily,	 gripping	 the	 table	 for	 support,	 his	 chair scraping	on	the	flagstone	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	we	are	to	survive	and	rebuild,	we	all	must	make	sacrifices.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	hardly	a	balanced	community,	is	it?	How	do	you	expect	to	rebuild?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	assure	you,	we’re	more	than	self-sufficient.	Our	residents	have	learned	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">skills	 they	 need	 from	 books.	 We	 no	 longer	 have	 need	 for	 the	 brute	 strength	 of men.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	very	sustainable	though,	is	it?	What	about	the	next	generation?	How</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	you	expect	to	have	children?”	asked	Riley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Men	 still	 have	 one	 small	 role	 to	 play	 in	 our	 future.	 And	 for	 that	 we	 keep several	for	breeding	purposes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Breeding?”	snorted	Zed.	“We’re	not	animals,	you	know?	You	can’t	just	lock</p>
<p class="calibre1">people	 up	 like	 that,	 like	 you	 would	 a	 bull	 or	 a	 stallion	 and	 let	 them	 out	 when you’re	ready	for	them	to	breed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	ignored	his	attempts	to	provoke	her.	“I	assure	you	that	is	precisely	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	have	chosen	to	do.”	She	smiled,	revealing	even,	white	teeth,	unblemished	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 vices	 of	 nicotine,	 sugar	 or	 alcohol.	 There	 was	 something	 about	 her	 that struck	 Riley	 as	 vaguely	 sinister,	 like	 something	 out	 of	 an	 Alfred	 Hitchcock movie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 off	 your	 rocker,	 you	 are.	 Stark	 raving	 bonkers.”	 Zed	 wagged	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">finger	at	the	sister,	but	his	eyes	had	started	to	glaze	over.	He	seemed	to	sway	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	on	his	feet	and	slumped	back	into	his	chair.	He	winced	with	pain,	cradling</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	wrist.	The	colour	had	drained	from	his	cheeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unmoved	 by	 Zed's	 weakened	 state,	 the	 sister’s	 thin	 lips	 relaxed	 a	 little	 in triumph.	“You	should	get	that	arm	looked	at	immediately.	You	are	clearly	not	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">well	 man.	 In	 the	 circumstances,	 we	 shall	 forgive	 your	 lack	 of	 manners	 and ingratitude.	Tell	Stella	to	take	him	straight	to	the	infirmary.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 was	 shaking	 with	 rage,	 incensed	 by	 the	 sister’s	 condescension	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">intolerance.	“You	really	are	a	piece	of	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	child,	please	don’t	take	this	personally.	The	world	has	changed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Since	 when	 did	 the	 principles	 of	 kindness,	 charity,	 forgiveness,	 generosity and	all	those	other	things	they	teach	you	in	Sunday	school	cease	to	apply?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	all	must	adapt	to	survive.	We	are	in	unchartered	waters.	God	created	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">virus	 to	 punish	 mankind	 for	 centuries	 of	 wickedness.	 Rather	 like	 Noah	 and	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>Ark,	the	sickness	is	simply	God’s	way	of	purging	the	world	of	its	vices:	wealth, power	and	violence.	We	will	all	be	washed	clean,	so	we	can	start	again.	Here	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chewton	Glen	we	are	doing	God’s	work,	building	a	new	Ark,	if	you	will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Those	are	just	Bible	stories,”	interrupted	Adele,	her	childlike	voice	defiant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	no	such	thing	as	God.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Silence,	 you	 impudent	 child.”	 The	 sister	 stiffened,	 ready	 to	 strike	 the	 girl before	she	noticed	Riley	primed,	on	the	edge	of	her	seat.	She	softened	her	tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Children	should	be	seen	and	not	heard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	 you	 see?	 The	 virus	 doesn’t	 discriminate	 between	 good	 and	 evil, </p>
<p class="calibre1">between	black	and	white,	between	men	and	women.	The	virus	doesn't	judge.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">kills	everyone.	The	few	that	survive	run	and	hide,	like	you,	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“God	 watches	 over	 us	 and	 protects	 us.	 We’re	 not	 hiding	 from	 anything	 or anyone.	We’re	simply	waiting	until	the	purge	is	complete	and	we	can	start	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stella	is	very	much	a	part	of	that	regeneration.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don’t	 know	 who	 you	 think	 Stella	 is.	 But	 I	 can	 assure	 you	 she’s	 not	 the person	you’re	making	her	out	to	be.	She’s	seen	things	no	girl	her	age	should	see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 had	 her	 locked	 up	 at	 the	 hospital,	 at	 the	 mercy	 of	 her	 captors.	 She	 was abused,	mistreated,	God	knows	what.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 pulled	 up	 Adele’s	 sleeve,	 revealing	 the	 collection	 of	 red	 marks	 that covered	her	arm.	“They	experimented	on	them,	took	their	blood,	injected	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	had	hundreds	of	prisoners	there.	These	two	are	the	lucky	ones.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	they	do	in	the	name	of	science	is	their	business.	There’s	nothing	I	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	 about	 that,”	 replied	 the	 sister,	 adjusting	 the	 folds	 of	 her	 dress.	 “Now	 she’s back	 with	 us,	 Stella’s	 safety	 and	 wellbeing	 is	 my	 responsibility.	 Stella	 means	 a lot	to	us	here.	She	is	one	of	the	chosen	few,	and	we	are	very	relieved	to	have	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	with	us.	It’s	out	of	the	question	that	she	should	leave	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 leaned	 over	 the	 table	 and	 glowered	 at	 the	 sister.	 “Stella	 is	 free	 to	 do whatever	she	wants.	No	one	is	going	to	stop	her	coming	back	to	the	castle	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">us,”	insisted	Riley,	helping	Zed	to	his	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	 you	 threatening	 me?”	 challenged	 the	 sister,	 seemingly	 amused	 by	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">suggestion.	 “It	 would	 be	 highly	 inadvisable	 for	 a	 girl	 in	 her	 condition	 to	 over-exert	herself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait.	Are	you	saying…?”	Riley	paused,	turning	the	idea	over	in	her	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	mean	to	say,	Stella	is	pregnant?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Precisely.	 She’s	 part	 of	 our	 regeneration	 programme.	 She	 was	 impregnated</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	she	left	and	we	are	most	pleased	to	get	her	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Twenty-eight</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 and	 Stella	 waited	 outside	 the	 infirmary	 for	 the	 nurse	 to	 assess	 Zed’s injuries.	She	asked	about	the	circumstances	of	his	injuries	and	whether	there	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	 chance	 of	 blood	 poisoning,	 perhaps	 from	 a	 rusty	 blade	 or	 metal.	 Riley wasn’t	sure	how	it	had	happened,	but	agreed	that	was	possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	put	him	on	a	drip	to	replace	lost	fluids,	but	I’m	afraid	he’s	much	too</p>
<p class="calibre1">weak	to	move	today.	He’ll	need	bed	rest	for	several	days	to	get	his	full	strength</p>
<p class="calibre1">back,”	explained	the	nurse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	strain	of	the	last	twenty-four	hours	had	crept	up	on	Riley.	She	suddenly</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt	 overwhelmed	 and	 exhausted.	 Stella	 reached	 out	 and	 took	 Riley’s	 hand	 in hers,	 leaning	 her	 head	 on	 Riley’s	 shoulder.	 “I’m	 sure	 he’ll	 be	 fine.	 He’s	 a fighter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	 never	 seen	 him	 like	 this	 before,”	 said	 Riley	 in	 just	 above	 a	 whisper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside	she	was	shaken	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 should	 really	 be	 in	 a	 hospital,	 where	 they	 can	 care	 for	 him	 properly,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">continued	the	nurse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 and	 Stella	 looked	 at	 each	 other	 and	 laughed.	 “We’re	 not	 taking	 him back	to	that	hospital,	don’t	worry	about	that.	He’ll	just	have	to	stay	here	and	get better.	We	appreciate	everything	you’re	doing	for	him.	Is	there	anything	we	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	 dehydrated	 but	 the	 drip	 should	 replace	 some	 of	 those	 lost	 fluids	 and deal	 with	 any	 infection.	 I’m	 doing	 the	 best	 I	 can	 with	 what	 I’ve	 got	 here,”	 she said,	shaking	her	head,	her	eyebrows	raised,	as	if	she	disapproved	of	the	violence</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	had	caused	these	injuries.	“We	should	see	an	improvement	in	the	morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	grimaced	and	put	her	hand	on	the	nurse’s	shoulder.	“You’ve	been	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	to	us.	Thank	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 nurse	 smiled.	 “I’ll	 keep	 an	 eye	 on	 him,	 don’t	 you	 worry.	 You’ll	 be	 the first	to	hear	when	he	comes	round.	I’ll	try	and	let	him	sleep	as	long	as	possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	nice	and	quiet	up	here,	so	he	shouldn’t	be	disturbed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 main	 staircase	 and	 ornately	 carved	 wooden	 banister	 curved	 round	 as	 it descended	 into	 the	 lobby	 area.	 Standing	 on	 the	 bottom	 step	 was	 one	 of	 the sisters,	her	arms	crossed,	as	if	she’d	been	waiting	for	some	time.	Riley	was	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">angry	 from	 their	 earlier	 encounter	 and	 in	 no	 mood	 for	 another	 confrontation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>This	sister	seemed	different;	she	had	a	warmer	disposition	than	the	authoritarian Sister	Theodora.	She	looked	a	few	years	younger	than	Riley.	It	was	hard	to	tell, </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 could	 only	 see	 her	 face,	 but	 Riley	 guessed	 mid-twenties.	 She	 had	 well-proportioned	 features,	 a	 dark	 complexion	 and	 round	 gentle	 eyes.	 Stella</p>
<p class="calibre1">introduced	her	as	Sister	Imelda. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please,	 call	 me	 Sister	 Mel,	 everyone	 else	 does.	 I	 understand	 that	 the	 man you	came	here	with	is	not	well	enough	to	travel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 could	 say	 that.	 He	 is	 on	 a	 drip	 with	 a	 nasty	 fever.	 Needs	 to	 rest	 up before	we	move	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 most	 regrettable.	 Bearing	 in	 mind	 he	 was	 injured	 saving	 Stella, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mother	Superior	has	agreed	that	you	can	all	stay	until	his	strength	recovers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	good	of	you.	Thank	you,”	said	Riley,	genuinely	grateful	but	mindful</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	would	be	conditions	attached.	“What	about	Joe?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sister	cleared	her	throat.	“Sister	Theodora	has	insisted	that…”	Her	voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">trailed	off	as	if	she	didn’t	know	quite	how	to	say	what	had	to	be	said.	“Look,	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	all	grateful	for	everything	you’ve	done,	but…the	Mother	Superior	is	adamant</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 Joe	 be	 confined	 to	 quarters,	 in	 the	 stables	 at	 the	 far	 end	 of	 the	 complex. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sister	 Theodora's	 decision	 is	 final.	 Our	 terms	 are	 non-negotiable,	 I’m	 afraid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sister	Mel’s	bottom	lip	quivered	ever	so	slightly,	revealing	her	discomfort	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">awkward	position	she	found	herself	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doesn’t	 look	 like	 we	 have	 a	 choice,	 right?	 It’s	 the	 sisters’	 way,	 or	 the highway?”	mocked	Riley,	infuriated	by	their	intransigence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	 don’t	 shoot	 the	 messenger,	 Riley.	 I	 don't	 make	 the	 rules.	 Sister Theodora	does.	I	just	get	the	unpopular	job	of	enforcing	them.”	She	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 still	 don’t	 understand	 why	 you	 all	 put	 up	 with	 her.	 You	 could	 leave,	 go someplace	else.	Why	do	you	stay	here?	You	don’t	have	to	live	like	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn't	it	obvious?	Because	followers	need	someone	to	follow.	Sister	Theodora</p>
<p class="calibre1">does	what	she	believes	is	right.	She	is	doing	God’s	work.	And	the	women	here</p>
<p class="calibre1">respect	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 the	 whole	 ‘no	 men’	 thing	 is	 medieval.	 A	 breeding	 programme	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">goodness’	sake?	It’s	inhuman	to	keep	men,	or	anyone	for	that	matter,	locked	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	 that.	 How	 do	 you	 square	 that	 with	 your	 values	 as	 a	 Catholic	 and	 a Christian?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“None	 of	 us	 like	 it,	 Riley,	 but	 we’re	 doing	 this	 for	 the	 greater	 good.	 And Stella	here	is	part	of	that.	She’s	been	chosen	to	become	a	mother,	to	give	birth	to the	next	generation.	To	be	part	of	our	future.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stella	looked	awkward	as	they	talked	about	her,	avoiding	eye	contact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	did	anyone	stop	to	ask	Stella	and	the	other	girls	whether	they	wanted	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 part	 of	 this?	 She’s	 just	 so	 young,	 for	 goodness’	 sake.	 Being	 forced	 to	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a>babies	at	her	age.	They’re	still	kids.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stella	looked	up,	her	eyes	heavy	with	tears.	“I	was	chosen,	Riley.	But	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">also	my	choice.	You	don’t	understand.	I	want	to	help,	to	be	part	of	this,	to	make</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	difference.	Don’t	you	see?	I	volunteered	for	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	guess	not.	I	think	you’re	all	certifiable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	then,	there	was	a	small	commotion	as	Joe	emerged	from	a	corridor	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 hands	 tied	 in	 front	 of	 him.	 The	 guard	 was	 a	 squat	 buxom	 woman	 in	 a	 blue polo	shirt	and	khaki	shorts,	with	a	ruddy	complexion.	She	pushed	him	forcefully</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 behind.	 Joe	 lingered	 for	 a	 second	 beside	 them.	 “This	 is	 ridiculous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently,	 I’m	 a	 danger	 to	 the	 community	 and	 can’t	 be	 trusted	 to	 keep	 my hands	 to	 myself.	 I	 need	 to	 be	 locked	 up,	 Riley,	 in	 the	 stable,	 like	 an	 animal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	people	are	doing	my	head	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	so	sorry,	Joe.	Listen,	it’s	just	for	a	day	or	two	until	Zed’s	better.	Do	it	for Zed,	yeah?	We	don’t	have	a	choice.	I’ll	come	see	you	later	on.	Try	and	stay	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	trouble.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	 was	 led	 away	 still	 grumbling,	 prompting	 another	 poke	 in	 the	 back	 from the	 stocky	 woman.	 He	 glanced	 over	 his	 shoulder	 and	 raised	 an	 eyebrow, </p>
<p class="calibre1">breaking	into	a	low	whistle	mimicking	the	theme	tune	from	 <i class="calibre4">The	Great	Escape</i>, which	 drew	 a	 snigger	 from	 Stella	 and	 Riley.	 The	 guard	 was	 not	 amused	 and hurried	after	him,	tutting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 followed	 Sister	 Mel	 outside	 to	 a	 large	 vegetable	 patch	 where	 three</p>
<p class="calibre1">women,	 with	 large	 wide-brimmed	 straw	 hats	 and	 white	 smocks,	 were	 planting potatoes	 and	 carrots	 in	 neat	 rows	 that	 stretched	 ahead	 of	 them	 in	 newly	 turned earth.	 A	 rusting	 metal	 wheelbarrow	 stood	 next	 to	 them,	 spilling	 over	 with cabbages	and	potatoes,	still	covered	in	earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	still	early	morning,	but	a	spring	sun	was	already	beating	down.	Riley</p>
<p class="calibre1">rolled	 up	 her	 sleeves	 and	 started	 rubbing	 her	 hands	 together.	 She	 tapped	 the nearest	 worker	 on	 the	 shoulder,	 who	 finished	 her	 planting	 before	 removing	 her gloves	and	giving	Riley	her	full	attention.	She	had	a	kind,	gentle	face,	her	eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">glinting	with	the	exertion	of	her	activities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry	 to	 disturb	 you.	 We	 were	 wondering	 if	 we	 can	 maybe	 help	 you.”	 She turned	 to	 Stella	 to	 explain.	 “Listen,	 if	 we’re	 going	 to	 stay	 here	 for	 a	 couple	 of days,	they	may	as	well	give	us	something	to	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	wouldn’t	say	no.	There	are	some	Wellington	boots	and	gardening	gloves</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 that	 shed	 over	 there.	 You	 might	 want	 to	 get	 changed	 first,”	 said	 the	 woman, sitting	back	on	her	haunches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	idea.	Why	don’t	we	go	and	grab	the	others?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	and	Stella	hurried	off	to	the	orchard	to	find	Mila	and	Adele,	where	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	talking	with	two	teenage	girls	in	the	shade	of	a	large	apple	tree.	Mila	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>asking	 them	 a	 flurry	 of	 questions	 about	 life	 at	 Chewton	 Glen.	 The	 older	 of	 the pair	called	herself	Gina,	introducing	her	friend	as	Lexie.	They	were	both	local, </p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 just	 up	 the	 road	 in	 Christchurch,	 and	 had	 known	 the	 sisters	 from	 their church	group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	like	we’re	particularly	religious	or	anything,	it	was	just	something	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">mums	 made	 us	 do	 on	 Sundays.	 Course	 they’re	 not	 around	 to	 tell	 us	 anything these	days.”	Gina	nudged	Lexie	in	the	ribs	and	they	both	giggled	girlishly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	come	on,”	said	Mila.	“Dish	the	dirt	on	the	whole	‘no	boys’	thing.	Two</p>
<p class="calibre1">young	girls	like	you?	Pull	the	other	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gina	 and	 Lexie	 exchanged	 furtive	 looks.	 Lexie	 shook	 her	 head	 at	 Gina, </p>
<p class="calibre1">imploring	her	to	keep	quiet,	but	Gina	couldn’t	help	herself.	There	was	something</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	 Mila,	 a	 sense	 of	 mischief	 that	 made	 it	 all	 right	 to	 tell	 these	 strangers everything,	even	if	it	meant	getting	into	trouble.	Gina	looked	like	she	was	dying</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	tell	someone	and	why	not	these	two	outsiders? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,	 we’ll	 tell	 you	 okay,	 but	 this	 goes	 no	 further.”	 She	 leaned	 in	 close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These	 boys	 we	 know,	 right,”	 she	 gave	 a	 little	 laugh,	 “they	 live	 just	 round	 the back	over	there,	in	that	big	house.	Sister	would	go	mental	if	she	found	out.	One</p>
<p class="calibre1">day,	 we	 saw	 them	 through	 the	 fence	 and	 had	 a	 little	 chat	 with	 them,	 we	 did, didn’t	we,	Lexie?”	 Lexie	nodded	coyly,	 her	fingers	fiddling	 nervously	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">acne	 on	 her	 chin.	 “And,	 we’ve	 met	 them	 for	 a	 drink	 a	 couple	 of	 times.	 They bring	the	booze	and	we	let	them	have	certain	favours	in	return.	Ain’t	that	right, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lex?”	 Lexie	 shook	 her	 head,	 but	 Gina	 was	 emboldened	 and	 wasn’t	 stopping</p>
<p class="calibre1">now.	Her	eyes	blazed	with	brazenness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	sort	of	favours?”	asked	Adele	from	a	distance,	hanging	on	their	every</p>
<p class="calibre1">word.	They’d	forgotten	she	was	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never	you	mind,	little	one,	this	is	grown-up	talk.	Lex	gave	both	of	them	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	kiss	last	time,	didn’t	you,	Lex,	you	little	minx.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lexie	 was	 mortified,	 her	 face	 flushed	 with	 shame,	 but	 there	 was	 a	 defiance about	her,	as	if	she	was	relieved	someone	else	knew	what	they’d	been	up	to.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">secret	had	clearly	been	burning	inside	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 aren’t	 you	 worried	 about	 infection?”	 asked	 Mila	 in	 a	 moment	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">seriousness.	“How	do	you	know	these	boys	haven’t	got	the	sickness?	Aren’t	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">putting	your	whole	community	at	risk?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	ain’t	thought	of	it	like	that.	Suppose	you’re	right.	Still,	if	we	were	going	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	sick,	we’d	have	got	sick	by	now,	wouldn’t	we?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Back	at	Hurst	 we	have	to	 follow	quarantine	procedures,”	 added	Mila.	“It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">dull	 but	 necessary.	 All	 new	 arrivals	 have	 to	 be	 kept	 apart	 for	 forty-eight	 hours before	they’re	allowed	in	to	the	camp.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’d	 be	 in	 so	 much	 trouble	 if	 the	 sisters	 found	 out,”	 said	 Gina,	 clearly</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>worried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Found	 out	 about	 what,	 Gina?”	 said	 a	 disapproving	 voice.	 No	 one	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">noticed	the	silent	approach	of	the	Mother	Superior,	her	hands	thrust	behind	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing,	sister.	We	was	only	talking,”	said	Gina,	blushing	scarlet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	doubt	that	very	much.	You	will	both	come	and	see	me	in	my	office	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">lunch.	 And	 you,”	 she	 said,	 pointing	 at	 Mila	 reproachfully,	 “may	 I	 remind	 you that	you	are	a	guest	here.	I	would	ask	that	you	not	lead	our	girls	astray.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mila	 started	 to	 defend	 herself	 but	 the	 sister	 cut	 her	 short.	 “Stella,	 take	 our guests	back	to	the	house	and	give	them	something	useful	to	do.	The	Devil	makes</p>
<p class="calibre1">work	for	idle	hands.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	were	just	offering	to	help	with	the	planting,”	suggested	Riley,	by	way	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">support. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indeed.	 Or	 you	 could	 try	 the	 kitchen.	 Anna	 could	 use	 your	 help	 peeling potatoes.	Now	off	you	go,”	encouraged	the	sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks	for	nothing.	Getting	me	into	trouble	like	that.”	Gina	tutted,	leaving</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mila	open-mouthed,	protesting	her	innocence. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Twenty-nine</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Four	 vehicles	 parked	 up	 outside	 the	 Ship	 Inn	 on	 the	 quayside	 in	 Lymington. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Around	 a	 dozen	 men	 dismounted,	 unpacked	 their	 gear	 and	 headed	 inside.	 The mood	was	relaxed,	but	they	moved	with	quiet	efficiency	and	purpose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	was	hauled	out	of	the	back	seat,	his	hands	still	tied,	and	made	to	wait	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	VW	van	while	the	guard	finished	his	cigarette.	He	watched	the	man	in	black</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 he	 shooed	 at	 a	 nearby	 seagull.	 The	 seagull	 glided	 a	 few	 yards	 away	 and voiced	 its	 displeasure,	 its	 mocking	 call	 echoed	 back	 from	 the	 row	 of	 buildings that	lined	the	quayside.	Several	other	gulls	swooped	down	and	joined	the	first	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 shrieking	 chorus.	 He	 kicked	 wildly	 at	 the	 nearest	 one	 almost	 losing	 his balance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bloody	seagulls.	Go	on,	get	lost.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 quayside	 was	 much	 changed	 since	 the	 last	 time	 Will	 was	 there.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembered	 visiting	 yachts	 moored	 three-deep	 at	 the	 jetty,	 fishing	 boats</p>
<p class="calibre1">unloading	their	catch	to	waiting	lorries,	children’s	faces	daubed	with	ice	cream</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	old	ladies	sitting	on	park	benches,	feeding	scraps	to	pigeons.	Gone	were	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">days	 of	 easy	 meals	 for	 scavenging	 seagulls.	 Like	 many	 creatures	 grown</p>
<p class="calibre1">dependent	 on	 humans,	 centuries	 of	 learned	 behaviours	 were	 hard	 to	 shift.	 Yet, old	 habits	 die	 hard	 and	 the	 seagulls	 blindly	 followed	 the	 men	 around, </p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunistically	waiting	for	something	dropped,	hoping	for	a	scrap	thrown	their</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	 guard	 stubbed	 out	 his	 cigarette	 and	 pushed	 Will	 through	 the	 doorway</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	 the	 semi-darkness	 of	 the	 pub.	 The	 windows	 were	 boarded	 up	 at	 the	 lower level,	reinforced	with	wooden	batons	nailed	in	place.	Behind	the	bar	counter,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">former	 landlord,	 an	 elderly	 man	 and	 his	 thirty-something	 daughter,	 handed	 out snacks	and	drinks	to	the	group	from	the	hospital. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Copper’s	 squad	 set	 up	 camp	 in	 the	 family	 restaurant	 area	 towards	 the	 back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 were	 already	 discussing	 this	 evening’s	 sortie,	 disassembling	 and	 cleaning their	weapons,	loading	bullets	into	magazines,	unpacking	and	repacking	pouches</p>

<p class="calibre1">surprise	 were	 critical	 to	 their	 success.	 One	 man	 unpacked	 an	 ordnance	 survey map,	marking	up	positions	and	approaches	with	a	red	marker	pen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	in	black	joined	them,	greeting	members	of	Copper’s	group,	slapping</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>one	 on	 the	 back.	 The	 man	 twisted	 round,	 perhaps	 resenting	 the	 unwanted contact,	before	recognising	who	it	was,	and	feigning	a	smile.	Copper	was	over	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	corner,	smoking	a	Cuban	cigar,	a	gift	the	publican	had	welcomed	him	with.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">struck	Will	as	a	small	token	but	an	important	mark	of	respect	for	his	position	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">de	 facto	 leader	 of	 the	 group.	 Copper	 spun	 the	 empty	 cigar	 tube	 between	 his stubby	fingers	on	the	darkly	stained	varnished	surface	and	laughed	at	one	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">men's	bawdy	jokes.	He	never	took	his	eyes	off	his	leader,	studying	his	movement</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	easy	mannerisms	like	a	vulture	watching	its	prey,	biding	his	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Any	sign	of	the	Hurst	team?”	asked	the	man	in	black.	He	stood	in	front	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Copper,	legs	wide	apart,	like	a	cowboy.	Attached	to	his	belt	was	a	large	bowie</p>
<p class="calibre1">knife	in	a	sheath	with	a	black	leather	strap	secured	to	his	thigh.	The	strap	looked uncomfortable	to	Will,	poorly	fitted	and	pulled	too	tight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	nothing.	Complete	waste	of	time.	We	waited	all	night	and	came	here	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">first	light.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	are	they?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	they	went	via	New	Milton.	Or	we	got	there	too	late,	who	knows?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 doesn’t	 matter	 now.	 We’ll	 find	 them	 sooner	 or	 later.	 We	 know	 where</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’re	heading.	Are	the	boats	ready?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	 We’re	 good.	 We’re	 set	 to	 leave	 at	 dusk.”	 He	 snatched	 the	 map	 from the	other	table	and	laid	it	out	in	front	of	them,	smoothing	out	the	creases.	“Our</p>
<p class="calibre1">pilot,	Trevor,	says	it’s	no	more	than	half	an	hour	from	here.”	He	pointed	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fisherman’s	quay	on	the	chart.	“Tide’s	with	us.	We’ll	head	round	in	three	groups. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First	group’s	with	me	in	the	R.I.B.	We’ll	take	a	wide	sweep	past	the	salt	marshes</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 out	 into	 the	 main	 channel	 before	 swinging	 up	 here	 and	 attacking	 from	 the south	 at	 what	 should	 be	 slack	 water.	 We’ve	 got	 all	 the	 gear	 you	 wanted,	 and Griff	here	has	done	some	rock	climbing	in	the	past.	He	says	that	the	castle	wall</p>
<p class="calibre1">shouldn’t	 be	 a	 problem.	 Then	 your	 group	 stays	 inshore	 and	 brings	 the	 main group	via	the	sheltered	Keyhaven	side	and	wait	for	our	signal	by	the	main	gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According	to	our	friend	here,”	he	pointed	at	Will,	“resistance	should	be	minimal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Couple	 of	 guards	 at	 the	 main	 gate,	 two-man	 patrol	 on	 the	 wall.	 Once	 they’re taken	care	of,	the	castle	is	ours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,	good.	Well	done,	Copper.	I	can’t	wait	to	see	the	look	on	their	faces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Remember,	we	need	the	two	girls	alive.	As	for	the	rest	of	them,	well,	I’ll	let	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	boys	have	some	fun.	Let	off	some	steam.	Save	their	leaders	for	me.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1">know	what’s	coming	to	them	after	their	little	jaunt	last	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	other	end	of	the	bar,	next	to	a	smashed-up	cigarette	machine,	there	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	dusty	old	piano.	One	of	the	men	from	the	hospital	wandered	over	and	lifted	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lid.	He	tried	a	couple	of	keys	and	found	the	piano	was	in	relatively	good	working</p>
<p class="calibre1">order.	 Flexing	 his	 fingers,	 he	 took	 a	 moment	 to	 get	 his	 bearings	 and	 launched</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>into	the	introduction	to	 <i class="calibre4">Skyfall</i>	to	the	muted	cheers	of	the	rest	of	the	assembled company.	They	stopped	what	they	were	doing	to	listen	in	awe.	Music	was	such	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">rarity	these	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Copper	 took	 a	 long	 draw	 on	 his	 cigar	 and	 blew	 a	 perfect	 smoke	 ring	 that glided	across	the	table	towards	the	man	in	black.	A	broad	grin	stretched	across</p>
<p class="calibre1">Copper’s	 face.	 He	 must	 be	 relishing	 the	 thought	 of	 flexing	 his	 muscles	 and getting	some	action,	thought	Will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	 made	 himself	 comfortable	 on	 the	 bench	 seat	 under	 the	 window, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wondering	how	on	earth	he	could	get	a	message	to	Hurst	to	warn	them	before	it</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Thirty</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	left	the	lighthouse	and	hurried	after	Jack.	Terra	and	Sam	were	already	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">board	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>,	 stowing	 their	 luggage	 and	 topping	 off	 the	 fuel	 tanks	 from	 a five-gallon	yellow	jerrycan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	emerging	from	their	meeting	with	Lieutenant	Peterson,	Jack	and	Terra</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	both	been	monosyllabic.	Tommy	watched	them	whispering.	What	were	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">keeping	 from	 him?	 He	 already	 had	 a	 hundred	 unanswered	 questions	 buzzing</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 I	 still	 don’t	 understand.	 Why	 is	 Peterson	 gathering	 together	 all	 the leaders	 from	 each	 camp?	 To	 discuss	 what	 exactly?	 Are	 they	 here	 to	 rescue	 us? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Are	they	part	of	a	relief	mission?	Please,	Jack,”	implored	Tommy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 American	 told	 us	 it’s	 all	 classified,	 for	 our	 ears	 only,”	 said	 Jack.	 “He said	it’s	a	matter	of	national	importance.	We’re	not	meant	to	talk	about	it,	even	to you.	 All	 you	 need	 to	 know	 is	 that	 we’ll	 be	 gone	 for	 a	 night.	 That	 there’s	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Summit’	being	held	on	the	Isle	of	Wight	and	that	Terra	and	I	are	invited.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terra	 put	 a	 hand	 on	 Tommy’s	 shoulder.	 He	 was	 almost	 beside	 himself	 with curiosity.	 “Listen,	 I	 know	 this	 is	 killing	 you	 not	 knowing,	 but	 it’s	 for	 the	 best. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 are	 people	 who	 don’t	 want	 this	 meet	 to	 happen.	 People	 who	 would	 do anything	to	stop	this	alliance.	Trust	no	one,	that’s	what	he	said.	There	are	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">forces	at	work	here	that	should	not	be	underestimated.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 other	 forces?”	 asked	 Tommy.	 “Do	 you	 mean	 like	 the	 French?	 Or	 are</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	talking	the	Russians,	or	maybe	the	Chinese?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	didn’t	say,	Tommy.	But	it	stands	to	reason	that	the	Americans’	presence</p>
<p class="calibre1">here	 will	 attract	 others,	 both	 good	 and	 bad.	 Anyway,	 listen,	 we’ve	 already	 told you	 too	 much.	 You’re	 to	 tell	 no	 one	 about	 any	 of	 this.	 If	 people	 ask,	 say	 that we’ve	gone	to	see	Anders	on	the	 <i class="calibre4">Charlotte</i>.	 There	 could	 be	 spies,	 even	 here	 at Hurst.	People	who	would	kill	for	that	information.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	okay.	But,	Jack,	you	know	we	can	be	trusted.	How	long	have	we	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">known	each	other?	Two	years,	give	or	take?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 smiled	 in	 sympathy	 but	 turned	 on	 his	 heels	 and	 started	 walking	 again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 nothing	 more	 to	 say.	 Jack	 climbed	 the	 small	 steps	 covered	 with	 old carpet	 and	 half	 hurdled	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>’s	 gunwale,	 athletically	 for	 a	 man	 of	 his advancing	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>“Trust	 me,	 Tommy.	 This	 is	 good	 for	 Hurst.	 You	 know	 we’ve	 been	 trying	 to broker	an	alliance	with	the	other	survivor	groups	for	months.	This	is	our	chance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	the	Americans	can	pull	it	off,	it	will	ensure	peace,	trade	and	co-operation	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">months,	maybe	years.	Even	if	there’s	the	smallest	chance	of	that,	we	need	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">there,	at	the	negotiating	table	when	that	deal	is	brokered.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	if	it’s	not,	what	then?”	cautioned	Tommy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	got	to	try,	Tommy,	you	must	see	that.	Hurst	is	isolated	and	weak	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">its	own.	Joining	together	would	secure	our	future.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	nodded	but	he	didn’t	look	too	convinced.	Terra	came	up	behind	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 put	 her	 arms	 around	 his	 shoulders.	 “Listen,	 we	 promise	 to	 tell	 you</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything	we	can	when	we	get	back.	Until	then,	you	and	Nathan	are	in	charge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Try	and	keep	a	lid	on	the	rumour	mill,	won’t	you?	We’ll	get	word	to	you	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">we’re	on	our	way	back	tomorrow	morning.	But	remember,	the	transmitter	range</p>
<p class="calibre1">isn’t	great	so	you’ll	probably	see	us	before	you	hear	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy's	body	language	spoke	volumes.	He	hated	being	left	in	the	dark	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">this.	 He	 stood	 shoulders	 slumped,	 forlornly	 watching	 their	 final	 preparations, like	a	scolded	child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	 cast	 off	 the	 bow	 as	 Jack	 unlooped	 the	 mooring	 line	 at	 the	 stern	 and handed	 it	 to	 Tommy.	 The	  <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>’s	 bow	 drifted	 out	 in	 the	 tide	 as	 Jack	 hurried back	 into	 the	 wheelhouse	 and	 put	 the	 engine	 lever	 ahead	 slow.	 The	  <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i> responded	 with	 a	 churning	 of	 water	 astern,	 propelling	 her	 slowly	 out	 into	 the main	 channel,	 heading	 east	 towards	 Cowes	 and	 Osborne	 Bay	 beyond.	 Tommy</p>
<p class="calibre1">raised	 his	 hand	 in	 farewell	 and	 watched	 them	 disappear	 from	 view	 behind	 the lighthouse. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
Jack	knew	the	way	with	his	eyes	closed.	He’d	passed	Osborne	House	a	hundred<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">times,	 the	 former	 residence	 of	 Queen	 Victoria.	 He’d	 visited	 the	 National	 Trust property	 with	 his	 teenage	 son	 many	 years	 ago.	 Back	 then,	 Osborne	 House	 had been	 maintained	 in	 all	 its	 Victorian	 splendour	 and	 open	 to	 the	 public.	 It	 was	 a bygone	 relic	 of	 the	 opulence	 and	 prosperity	 of	 the	 British	 Empire	 preserved	 in aspic	for	future	generations.	Jack	remembered	the	place	well	from	his	previous</p>
<p class="calibre1">visit.	 The	 stately	 home	 encapsulated	 all	 the	 glory	 and	 decadence	 of	 the	 British Empire	at	its	height	in	the	nineteenth	century.	Back	then	the	Empire	had	covered</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	quarter	of	the	entire	globe.	He	remembered	the	tour	guide	telling	them	proudly</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 in	 Victorian	 times	 “the	 sun	 never	 set	 on	 the	 British	 Empire”.	 The	 whole place	 spoke	 volumes	 about	 the	 unbridled	 patriotism	 that	 prevailed	 at	 the	 time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Right	 now,	 he	 snorted,	 the	 British	 could	 barely	 manage	 a	 cup	 of	 tea,	 let	 alone</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a>rule	the	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Until	 the	 breakdown,	 Osborne	 House	 had	 been	 a	 popular	 visitor	 attraction</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 beautiful	 landscaped	 gardens,	 manicured	 lawns	 and	 ornamental	 ponds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Planted	orchards	ran	down	to	a	beach	that	looked	back	across	the	Solent	towards</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 mainland.	 Sam	 and	 Jack	 had	 moored	 off	 that	 beach	 for	 a	 swim	 so	 many times,	sunbathing	on	the	foredeck	of	the	 <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>	on	their	way	back	from	fishing trips	or	visits	to	No	Man’s	Land	Fort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	had	no	idea	what	had	become	of	Osborne	House	itself.	He	imagined	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 likely	 home	 to	 a	 group	 of	 some	 description.	 The	 Isle	 of	 Wight	 and	 its islanders	had	suffered	terrible	hardship	and	total	collapse	of	law	and	order,	same</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	everywhere	else.	They	had	been	hit	hard	by	the	virus,	but	their	isolation	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhat	 insulated	 them	 from	 the	 resulting	 chaos	 and	 violence	 that	 followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sense	of	unity	and	community	afforded	by	its	island	status,	together	with	its</p>
<p class="calibre1">physical	separation	from	the	mainland,	meant	that	rival	groups	were	a	little	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">willing	 to	 work	 together.	 There	 were	 fewer	 raids	 and	 less	 pressure	 from	 a starving	population,	less	competition	for	resources. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 his	 travels,	 Jack	 had	 met	 several	 different	 groups	 on	 the	 island.	 There were	dozens	of	them,	scattered	along	the	coastline	and	inland.	The	Isle	of	Wight</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 rich	 in	 farmland,	 with	 hundreds	 of	 greenhouses	 growing	 tomatoes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">cucumbers,	 and	 other	 vegetables	 and	 fruit.	 It	 had	 its	 own	 vineyards,	 breweries and	dairy	farms,	meaning	there	was	an	abundance	of	food	in	the	early	days,	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">groups	 gathered	 around	 farm	 buildings	 and	 smaller	 villages.	 Yet,	 over	 time	 the crop	 yield	 had	 collapsed.	 Most	 of	 those	 greenhouses	 had	 fallen	 into	 disrepair, growing	 wild	 and	 untended,	 with	 hundreds	 of	 hectares	 of	 vegetables	 rotting	 in the	ground.	Ripened	tomatoes	died	on	the	vine,	with	no	one	left	to	harvest	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	had	heard	whispers	of	a	rising	power,	a	man	they	called	Briggs.	Like	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">many	on	the	mainland,	opportunists	with	a	thirst	for	power,	Briggs	had	formed	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">colony	 of	 former	 inmates	 from	 Parkhurst	 Prison,	 near	 Newport	 at	 the	 centre	 of the	 island.	 He	 had	 begun	 to	 expand	 his	 sphere	 of	 influence,	 forming	 alliances where	 possible.	 He	 gave	 short	 shrift	 to	 those	 who	 stood	 against	 him.	 Would Briggs	 be	 present	 at	 this	 gathering	 of	 leaders?	 It	 seemed	 plausible.	 Jack wondered	which	of	his	friends	would	make	the	trip	to	Osborne	and	which	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">stay	 away,	 suspicious	 of	 change,	 of	 outsiders,	 of	 the	 Americans,	 preferring	 to keep	things	as	they	were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terra	joined	him	in	the	wheelhouse	and	put	an	arm	around	his	waist.	She	put</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 head	 on	 his	 shoulder	 and	 gave	 him	 a	 little	 peck	 on	 the	 cheek.	 Terra	 loved their	 infrequent	 trips	 away	 from	 Hurst	 where	 they	 could	 be	 relaxed	 in	 each other’s	 company,	 free	 from	 the	 prying	 eyes	 and	 expectations	 of	 others.	 At	 the stern,	 Sam	 stood	 coiling	 the	 mooring	 lines	 and	 stowing	 the	 food	 and	 supplies</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>they	 had	 loaded	 in	 the	 lockers.	 He	 watched	 them	 with	 some	 small	 degree	 of affection.	He	had	once	confided	in	Jack	that	Terra	reminded	him	of	his	mother.	A</p>
<p class="calibre1">proud,	 fiercely	 Catholic	 woman,	 resettled	 on	 the	 south	 coast	 of	 England	 from Wexford	in	southern	Ireland.	Jack	knew	Sam’s	father	had	died	when	he	was	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">young,	yet	his	mother	was	stoic	in	her	grief.	She	simply	got	on	with	it,	holding</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	three	cleaning	jobs	and	looking	after	four	children	under	the	age	of	fifteen</p>
<p class="calibre1">without	 complaint.	 Terra	 had	 that	 same	 indefatigability	 and	 quiet	 resilience	 he knew	Sam	admired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	poked	his	head	round	the	doorway	to	the	wheelhouse	and	tapped	Jack	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 shoulder.	 “I've	 been	 wondering	 about	 those	 Americans.	 Why	 do	 you	 think they’re	really	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	shrugged	his	shoulders,	trying	to	bat	away	the	question.	He	wasn't	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mood	 for	 a	 long	 drawn-out	 discussion.	 Sam	 tapped	 him	 on	 the	 shoulder	 again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	was	so	special	about	the	Isle	of	Wight	that	they	would	organise	a	meeting</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	Osborne	House?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	shook	his	head,	claiming	ignorance,	but	he	had	been	thinking	the	same</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing	himself.	He	looked	over	his	shoulder	at	Sam.	“Best	thing	we	can	do	is	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	our	hopes	up	and	get	on	with	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	 nodded	 and	 stooped	 to	 pick	 up	 a	 long	 thread	 of	 seaweed,	 throwing	 it over	the	side,	before	wiping	the	slime	on	his	trousers.	Behind	them	Hurst	grew</p>
<p class="calibre1">smaller	by	the	minute	until,	when	he	looked	back	again,	it	was	just	a	black	line</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	horizon.	A	castle	surrounded	by	the	tidal	waters	of	the	Solent,	and	the	tide was	just	beginning	to	turn. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Thirty-one</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	 engaged	 the	 windlass,	 and	 the	 anchor	 chain	 rattled	 out	 of	 the	 forward locker,	splashing	into	the	sheltered	waters	of	Osborne	Bay.	At	the	stern,	Jack	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">breathing	heavily	as	he	used	a	foot	pump	to	inflate	a	six-person	grey	inflatable</p>
<p class="calibre1">Avon	 dinghy.	 He	 squeezed	 the	 sides,	 gave	 another	 few	 pumps	 and	 secured	 the nozzle	with	a	twist	as	he	detached	the	mouth	of	the	pump	hose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Between	 them	 they	 manhandled	 the	 inflatable	 over	 the	 side.	 Holding	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">painter	loosely,	the	dinghy	flopped	on	to	the	surface	of	the	water,	skating	a	few</p>
<p class="calibre1">metres	before	jerking	back.	Jack	lowered	the	stainless	steel	ladder	and	supported</p>
<p class="calibre1">Terra	as	she	clambered	down,	handing	her	the	rucksack	and	holdall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	 passed	 Jack	 the	 wooden	 oars	 which	 he	 inserted	 one	 at	 a	 time	 into	 the hard	rubber	rowlocks.	Jack	anchored	his	feet	against	the	sides	of	the	inflatable, </p>
<p class="calibre1">took	 a	 quick	 look	 over	 his	 shoulder	 to	 get	 his	 bearings	 and	 started	 pulling	 for shore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Keep	 your	 eyes	 peeled,	 Sam.	 We’ll	 signal	 if	 we	 need	 you.	 First	 sign	 of trouble,	cast	off	and	head	for	deeper	water.	Wish	us	luck.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	 be	 fine.	 Terra	 will	 keep	 you	 on	 the	 straight	 and	 narrow.	 See	 you tomorrow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 blades	 of	 the	 oars	 dived	 gently	 beneath	 the	 surface	 and	 drove	 them</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward.	It	was	no	more	than	fifty	metres	to	row	and,	sheltered	from	the	south-</p>
<p class="calibre1">westerly,	they	surfed	the	shallow	waves,	gliding	gracefully	inwards.	When	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	three	metres	out,	he	stowed	the	oars	and	they	coasted	the	rest	of	the	way	in, </p>
<p class="calibre1">bumping	 gently	 on	 to	 the	 sandy	 beach.	 Jack	 stepped	 ashore	 in	 his	 dark	 blue, leather-lined	 boots,	 standing	 ankle-deep	 to	 help	 Terra	 before	 reaching	 to	 grab their	bags. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 dragged	 the	 dinghy	 above	 the	 tide	 line,	 littered	 with	 seaweed,	 flotsam and	jetsam,	frayed	rope	and	plastic	bottles.	He	tied	the	painter	to	a	large	iron	ring secured	 to	 a	 concrete	 post.	 The	 lower	 branches	 of	 an	 ancient	 oak	 caressed	 the surface	 of	 the	 water	 as	 each	 wave	 came	 to	 a	 gentle	 end,	 swirling	 amongst	 its foliage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 started	 the	 climb	 up	 to	 the	 main	 building,	 passing	 an	 old-fashioned bathing	carriage	where	Queen	Victoria	and	her	ladies	were	said	to	have	changed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 enter	 the	 water,	 their	 modesty	 preserved,	 unseen	 by	 other	 bathers.	 A	 “Punch</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>and	Judy”	booth	was	overturned	by	the	winter	storms,	paint	peeling	from	its	red and	 yellow	 stripes.	 Its	 bright	 red	 wooden	 roof	 was	 holed	 in	 several	 places, revealing	 where	 an	 entertainer	 would	 have	 operated	 multiple	 hand	 puppets	 for the	delight	of	small	children	and	grown-ups	alike.	They	climbed	the	dusty	path</p>
<p class="calibre1">past	 thickly	 wooded	 slopes,	 arboretums	 and	 meadows	 filled	 with	 wild	 flowers, fields	of	poppies	and	daisies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	caught	their	first	glimpse	of	the	grand	Italian-style	palazzo	house	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">its	 twin	 towers	 and	 sweeping	 steps	 leading	 up	 to	 the	 terraces,	 courtyard	 and entrance	 above	 them.	 The	 Victorian	 gardens	 were	 once	 the	 pride	 of	 the	 island, boasting	flowers	from	all	over	Europe,	surrounded	by	shrubs	beautifully	clipped</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 shaped.	 Today	 the	 flower	 beds	 were	 overgrown	 with	 weeds,	 the	 shrubs</p>
<p class="calibre1">yellow	and	bushy.	The	ornamental	ponds	and	fountains	were	dry	or	clogged	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">algae	 and	 weed.	 A	 koi	 carp	 lay	 belly	 up,	 twitching	 on	 the	 surface,	 bloated	 and rigid.	 Jack	 wondered	 why	 no	 bird	 had	 helped	 itself	 to	 a	 ready	 meal	 and	 then noticed	how	silent	it	was	here.	There	were	no	birds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 walked	 past	 magnificent	 statues,	 many	 of	 which	 were	 bullet-ridden; </p>
<p class="calibre1">handy	 targets	 for	 bored	 guards	 with	 nothing	 better	 to	 do.	 Some	 statues	 were missing	arms	or	legs,	others	were	more	or	less	destroyed.	Terra	looked	nervously</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	Jack	but	he	patted	her	on	the	back	reassuringly	as	if	to	say	“It’s	going	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 the	 top	 lawn,	 a	 rusted	 old	 Sikorsky	 helicopter	 perched	 proudly,	 its	 rotor blades	 drooping	 languidly	 towards	 the	 grass.	 It	 barely	 looked	 airworthy,	 and Jack	doubted	whether	it	had	made	it	very	far.	Its	pilot	was	leaning	lazily	against</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	cockpit	door	watching	them	both	climb	the	steps	towards	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 guard	 at	 the	 side	 entrance	 waved	 them	 over	 and	 patted	 them	 down	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">weapons	 or	 anything	 else	 secreted	 about	 their	 person.	 He	 was	 thorough, </p>
<p class="calibre1">thrusting	his	gloved	hand	deep	into	the	furthest	recesses	of	the	rucksack.	When</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	was	satisfied,	he	thanked	them	both	and	pointed	towards	another	guard	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">doorway	 to	 a	 stone-paved	 corridor	 that	 echoed	 with	 their	 footsteps.	 The	 walls were	 lined	 with	 empty	 picture	 hooks	 and	 outlines	 of	 the	 framed	 portraits	 and artwork	that	had	once	hung	there.	Jack	wondered	whether	they	had	been	looted</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	simply	removed	for	storage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	magnificent	reception	room	took	Terra’s	breath	away.	It	was	like	walking</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	an	Indian	palace,	complete	with	ivory	carvings,	shields	and	swords	mounted</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 wall.	 Many	 were	 engraved	 silver	 and	 ornate	 copper	 works.	 Several	 of these	trophies	were	missing,	leaving	dusty	outlines.	Terra	stood	and	stared	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ceiling,	beautifully	sculpted	in	white	plaster.	She	had	never	seen	anything	like	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	tugged	at	Terra’s	sleeve	and	guided	her	towards	the	assembled	group	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	far	end	of	the	room.	The	local	men	were	well	dressed,	beards	trimmed	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>hair	 combed	 or	 brushed	 back.	 They	 were	 talking	 animatedly,	 cut-glass champagne	 flutes	 in	 their	 hands.	 At	 the	 centre	 of	 the	 group	 holding	 court	 was Lieutenant	 Peterson,	 wearing	 full	 dinner	 dress.	 His	 military	 whites	 and	 medals were	resplendent,	his	cap	tucked	under	his	left	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peterson	broke	off	his	conversation	to	welcome	them	both.	“Gentlemen,	I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	 to	 introduce	 you	 to	 Jack	 and	 Terra	 from	 Hurst	 Castle.	 Jack,	 I	 suspect	 you already	know	most	of	these	guys.	This	is	our	host,	John	Simpson.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 nodded	 and	 shook	 hands,	 a	 little	 awkward	 with	 all	 this	 formality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peterson	handed	Terra	and	Jack	glasses	of	champagne	from	a	silver	tray	and	led</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	round	the	rest	of	the	group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	told	you	I	should	have	put	on	a	frock,”	whispered	Terra,	self-conscious	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	tired	woollen	jumper	and	blue	jeans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	look	beautiful,”	he	replied,	squeezing	her	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	didn’t	you	tell	me	we	were	coming	to	a	party?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 wore	 no	 make-up	 other	 than	 the	 lipstick	 she	 had	 the	 foresight	 to	 apply before	 leaving	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>.	 As	 the	 only	 woman	 here,	 Jack	 had	 no	 doubt	 she would	 light	 up	 the	 room.	 Terra	 had	 spent	 most	 of	 her	 life	 surrounded	 by	 men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 thrived	 in	 a	 man’s	 world.	 She	 always	 got	 what	 she	 wanted.	 There	 was something	 self-contained	 about	 her,	 a	 bold	 confidence.	 She	 knew	 just	 when	 to turn	on	the	charm,	to	have	powerful	men	hang	on	her	every	word,	but	also	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 stand	 firm.	 Jack	 had	 never	 met	 anyone	 quite	 like	 her	 before.	 He	 watched	 as she	 flirted	 conspicuously	 with	 their	 host,	 touching	 his	 arm	 and	 laughing	 at	 his laboured	attempts	at	humour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More	 people	 were	 arriving	 all	 the	 time	 and	 the	 room	 reverberated	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversation	 and	 the	 sound	 of	 popping	 champagne	 corks.	 Jack	 stood	 by	 the window,	 observing	 the	 group.	 He	 had	 to	 pinch	 himself	 to	 believe	 what	 he	 was seeing.	People	were	acting	like	the	outbreak	had	never	happened,	getting	swept</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	in	the	moment.	The	champagne	was	going	straight	to	his	head.	The	bubbles, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	fizz,	the	whole	thing	made	him	feel	nauseous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terra	 spotted	 him	 standing	 alone	 and	 made	 her	 excuses,	 breaking	 off	 from conversation	to	join	Jack.	“What’s	up,	Jack?	You	don’t	look	like	you’re	enjoying</p>
<p class="calibre1">yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 eyes	 darted	 around	 the	 room,	 checking	 to	 see	 if	 anyone	 else	 felt	 this whole	 evening	 was	 a	 little	 surreal.	 “This	 all	 feels	 contrived,	 Terra.	 The champagne,	 the	 cheer.	 It’s	 like	 none	 of	 them	 know	 what’s	 going	 on	 in	 the	 real world,	over	there	on	the	mainland.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terra	 smiled,	 but	 recognised	 Jack's	 discomfort.	 “Oh,	 they	 know	 all	 right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’ve	had	it	just	as	bad	as	us.	They’re	just	putting	on	a	little	show	for	our	VIP</p>
<p class="calibre1">American	 friend.	 A	 taste	 of	 British	 razzmatazz.	 That’s	 all.	 Why	 not	 enjoy</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>yourself,	 let	 your	 hair	 down?	 Drink	 their	 fine	 wine,	 enjoy	 their	 canapés,	 hear what	they	have	to	say.	Come	on,	where’s	the	old	Jack	I've	heard	so	much	about? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	one	who	could	drink	the	pub	dry	and	still	ride	a	bicycle	home	to	bed?	Come</p>
<p class="calibre1">on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 playfully	 nudged	 him	 in	 the	 ribs	 and	 reluctantly	 he	 responded	 to	 her encouragement.	 They	 rejoined	 the	 others,	 recharged	 their	 glasses	 and	 forgot themselves,	at	least	for	a	little	while. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	small	commotion	in	the	corridor	as	a	late	arrival	protested	loudly</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	 being	 searched.	 With	 a	 loud	 greeting	 that	 silenced	 the	 whole	 room, Captain	Anders	Bjørklund	from	the	 <i class="calibre4">Maersk	Charlotte</i>	strode	in,	his	arms	raised high,	 First	 Officer	 Victor	 by	 his	 side.	 Anders	 walked	 straight	 up	 to	 Jack	 and slapped	 him	 on	 the	 back	 before	 hugging	 his	 friend.	 He	 ignored	 the	 trickle	 of champagne	that	dribbled	down	his	back	from	Jack’s	glass.	Victor’s	greeting	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	little	cooler.	He	appeared	bored	and	aloof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Last	 to	 arrive	 was	 Captain	 Armstrong,	 accompanied	 by	 two	 other	 Royal</p>
<p class="calibre1">naval	officers.	They	were	formally	attired	in	navy	mess	dress,	dark	blue	dinner</p>
<p class="calibre1">jackets,	 bow	 ties,	 all	 brass	 buttons	 and	 gold	 braid.	 The	 captain	 stiffly	 saluted Lieutenant	 Peterson	 and	 then	 warmly	 shook	 hands	 with	 the	 assembled	 guests, introducing	 himself	 and	 his	 officers.	 Jack	 watched	 this	 incongruous	 exchange over	Anders’	shoulder	and	despite	the	obvious	charade,	he	couldn’t	help	but	feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 renewed	 sense	 of	 hope.	 He	 wondered	 whether	 the	 combination	 of	 these	 two military	organisations	would	be	sufficient	to	restore	some	semblance	of	order	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	 blighted	 region.	 His	 eyes	 narrowed	 as	 he	 studied	 their	 body	 language	 that oozed	bravado	and	confidence.	He’d	been	around	the	block	enough	to	know	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">appearances	 were	 deceptive.	 Most	 military	 men	 he	 knew	 couldn’t	 organise	 a piss-up	in	a	brewery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	officers	did	a	double	take	when	he	spotted	Terra,	excused	himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 his	 group	 and	 tapped	 her	 on	 the	 shoulder.	 She	 turned	 around	 and	 looked surprised.	 He	 seemed	 delighted	 to	 see	 her.	 “Good	 heavens.	 I’m	 sure	 we	 know each	other?	You’re	a	friend	of	Allan’s,	aren’t	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terra	 looked	 back	 at	 him	 blankly,	 regaining	 her	 composure.	 “I’m	 sorry, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you’ve	got	me	there.	I’m	not	sure…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	know,”	he	continued	confidently.	“We	met	at	a	party	a	few	years	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deborah,	no,	Debbie,	isn’t	it?”	he	said,	searching,	trying	to	make	the	connection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terra	blushed	and	glanced	towards	Jack.	“I	think	you	have	me	confused	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone	 else.	 Excuse	 me.”	 She	 drained	 her	 glass	 with	 a	 shaking	 hand	 before rejoining	Jack.	She	feigned	a	smile,	but	looked	decidedly	uncomfortable.	“Silly</p>
<p class="calibre1">fool.	 Thought	 I	 was	 someone	 else.	 Could	 you	 get	 me	 another	 champagne, </p>
<p class="calibre1">please?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>“Sure,	coming	right	up,”	said	Jack,	patting	her	on	the	wrist.	On	his	way	to	the bar,	he	noticed	the	officer	still	staring	in	Terra's	direction.	He	seemed	positively bemused	by	her	failure	to	recognise	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Thirty-two</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 dinner	 had	 been	 delicious.	 Grilled	 trout	 followed	 by	 spit-roasted	 chicken, complete	 with	 all	 the	 trimmings.	 Each	 course	 was	 washed	 down	 with	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">succession	 of	 fine	 wines,	 the	 like	 of	 which	 Jack	 had	 never	 tasted	 before,	 each requiring	 a	 different	 glass.	 Even	 the	 cutlery	 had	 been	 overwhelming.	 Three separate	 forks,	 knives	 and	 spoons,	 all	 of	 different	 shapes	 and	 sizes	 in	 polished silver,	fit	for	a	royal	banquet.	He	had	watched	his	partner	carefully	to	ensure	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">chose	 correctly.	 He	 quickly	 figured	 out	 that	 if	 he	 started	 from	 the	 outside	 and worked	his	way	in,	he	wouldn’t	go	too	far	wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 the	 plates	 had	 been	 cleared,	 their	 host,	 John	 Simpson,	 stood	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">formally	 welcomed	 everyone	 before	 inviting	 Lieutenant	 Peterson	 to	 say	 a	 few words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 American	 officer	 wiped	 the	 sides	 of	 his	 mouth	 with	 a	 napkin,	 touched John	on	the	shoulder	and	shook	his	hand	before	slowly	rising.	He	looked	around</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	room	at	the	forty-plus	guests,	making	eye	contact	with	several	of	them	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">starting	to	speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ladies	and	gentlemen,	you	honour	me	with	your	hospitality	this	evening.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 some	 time	 since	 I	 have	 enjoyed	 an	 evening	 quite	 this	 much,	 in	 surroundings anything	like	as	grand	as	the	former	residence	of	a	King	and	Queen	of	England. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	those	of	you	who	don’t	know	me,	my	name	is	Lieutenant	Peterson.	I	am	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">commanding	officer	of	the	United	States	warship,	the	 <i class="calibre4">Chester</i>,	an	Arleigh-Burke class	 guided	 missile	 destroyer	 currently	 at	 anchor	 just	 off	 Portland	 Bill.	 I’ve spent	the	best	part	of	the	last	twenty	years	serving	my	country,	sailing	the	seven</p>
<p class="calibre1">seas.	My	daddy	was	a	navy	man.	You	could	say	I	have	salt	water	in	my	veins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During	that	time,	I’ve	seen	action	no	less	than	seven	times	in	Iraq,	Afghanistan</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	Syria.	I	had	the	honour	of	serving	alongside	Her	Majesty’s	Royal	Navy	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">countless	 missions	 and	 exercises,	 including	 a	 six-month	 secondment	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">destroyer	  <i class="calibre4">HMS	 Daring</i>.	 I	 have	 visited	 the	 White	 House,	 met	 the	 president, visited	some	of	the	finest	embassies	in	the	world.	I	guess	I	never	thought	I’d	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything	 like	 that	 again,	 so	 this	 evening	 has	 been	 nothing	 short	 of	 spectacular, and	 for	 that	 I	 thank	 each	 and	 every	 one	 of	 you,	 but	 particularly	 our	 host,	 John Simpson.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peterson	invited	the	rest	of	the	room	to	join	him	in	another	round	of	applause. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>He	checked	the	scribbled	notes	he	had	in	front	of	him	on	a	small	jotter	pad	and flipped	to	the	next	page. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	let’s	get	down	to	business.	We	didn’t	come	here	for	a	party.	I	invited	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">here	 to	 discuss	 the	 future.	 I	 know	 a	 lot	 of	 you	 have	 a	 million	 questions,	 and	 I thank	you	for	your	patience	and	for	coming	here	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 took	 another	 sip	 of	 water	 and	 then	 drained	 the	 glass,	 his	 hand	 shaking almost	imperceptibly.	He	proceeded	to	recount	their	story	since	the	 <i class="calibre4">USS	Chester</i> left	 her	 homeport	 of	 San	 Diego	 for	 the	 last	 time	 nearly	 three	 years	 ago.	 Their tour	 of	 duty	 took	 them	 to	 the	 Middle	 East,	 patrolling	 the	 shores	 of	 Yemen	 and Ethiopia,	 protecting	 commercial	 shipping	 against	 pirates.	 They	 had	 made	 stops in	 Egypt,	 Sudan,	 Qatar	 and	 Kuwait.	 When	 the	 first	 outbreak	 occurred,	 the <i class="calibre4">Chester</i>	 was	 ordered	 to	 head	 with	 all	 available	 speed	 to	 Karachi	 in	 Pakistan	 to provide	humanitarian	aid	and	to	airlift	US	service	personnel	from	trouble	zones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	 the	 evacuation	 order	 came,	 it	 came	 too	 late	 for	 my	 crew.	 Many	 had already	 been	 in	 contact	 with	 the	 locals	 in	 the	 performance	 of	 their	 mandated duties.	Much	of	the	local	population	was	already	infected.	By	the	time	the	scale</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	outbreak	became	clear,	it	was	too	late.	Despite	our	best	efforts	to	enforce</p>
<p class="calibre1">quarantine	and	instigate	security	protocols,	the	virus	wreaked	havoc	on	board	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Chester</i>	 and	 there	 were	 one	 hundred	 and	 fifty-two	 fatalities,	 including	 our commanding	officer,	XO	and	chief	engineer.	The	rest	of	the	crew	barely	made	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	of	Karachi	alive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	bowed	his	head	and	paused	to	gather	himself	before	proceeding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	we’ve	all	had	it	bad.	We’ve	all	suffered.	We’ve	all	lost	friends	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">family.	I	have	a	wife	and	two	kids	back	in	California.	I	haven’t	heard	from	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	more	than	two	years	since	the	US	went	dark	and	all	civilian	communication</p>
<p class="calibre1">ceased.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	a	few	whispers	at	this	disclosure.	Many	amongst	them	still	clung</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 belief	 that	 the	 global	 outbreak	 had	 been	 contained	 and	 the	 US	 had	 been better	prepared	and	able	to	immunise	and	stop	the	spread,	at	least	better	than	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	UK.	Peterson	appealed	for	quiet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	reason	we	are	here,	as	I	told	each	of	you	personally	when	I	visited	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	your	camps	and	homes,	is	to	make	a	stand	against	the	virus,	right	here	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Isle	of	Wight.	This	island	is	one	of	the	biggest	in	the	UK	and	was,	until	recently, the	 second	 most	 populous.	 It	 means	 the	 island	 is	 uniquely	 qualified	 for	 our purposes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	paused	to	let	his	audience	digest	his	words.	“Camp	Wight,	as	it	will	now</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 known,	 will	 be	 the	 first	 of	 many	 such	 bases	 we	 will	 need	 to	 build,	 but	 first we’ll	need	to	create	a	virus-free	safe	zone	here	on	the	island	as	a	launch	pad	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	wider	clean-up	of	the	UK	mainland.	None	of	us	should	be	under	any	illusion	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a>the	 scale	 of	 that	 challenge.	 It	 will	 take	 months,	 maybe	 years,	 but	 if	 we	 work together	we	will	succeed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our	 first	 job	 is	 to	 secure	 the	 Isle	 of	 Wight.	 Then	 we	 can	 set	 up	 quarantine zones	 to	 process	 newcomers.	 That	 means	 building	 accommodation,	 providing</p>
<p class="calibre1">humanitarian	aid,	ensuring	security	and	safety,	health	and	hygiene.	Camp	Wight</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	 be	 a	 fresh	 start	 for	 the	 UK	 and	 one	 we’ll	 look	 to	 replicate	 throughout Europe.	 Gibraltar,	 Cyprus,	 Majorca,	 Iceland,	 Sicily.	 To	 be	 successful,	 we	 will need	 to	 train	 civilians	 to	 perform	 the	 roles	 needed	 to	 get	 the	 generators	 back online,	 to	 secure	 running	 water,	 to	 restart	 food	 production,	 to	 plant	 crops,	 to nurture	livestock,	to	build	towards	self-sufficiency	on	the	island.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 dissenting	 voice	 from	 the	 back	 shouted	 out,	 “What	 if	 we	 don’t	 want	 the island	to	change?	Why	give	up	everything	we’ve	worked	so	hard	for?	Why	share</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	with	thousands	of	others	from	the	mainland?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peterson	could	not	quite	make	out	the	person’s	face	but	listened	and	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	understand	your	concern.	And	you’re	right.	What	I’m	asking	you	to	give</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	 is	 substantial.	 But	 the	 opportunity	 it	 presents	 is	 also	 significant.	 Whatever your	private	and	personal	reasons,	this	is	a	huge	chance	to	be	part	of	a	fresh	start for	 your	 country.	 You	 would	 each	 play	 leading	 roles	 in	 the	 reconstruction.	 I’m sure	I	don’t	have	to	spell	it	out	to	you	all.	Ladies	and	gentlemen,	together	we	can relight	the	fires,	kick-start	the	engine	and	broadcast	an	invitation	on	every	radio signal	to	come	and	join	us	here	on	the	island.	This	is	our	chance	to	build	a	new</p>
<p class="calibre1">world.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	several	nods	and	murmurs	of	approval,	one	old-timer	mumbling, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hear	hear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 don’t	 need	 me	 to	 tell	 you	 that	 this	 country	 has	 been	 sent	 back	 to	 the dark	ages.	We	have	no	functioning	government,	no	police,	no	infrastructure,	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">cell	 phones,	 no	 computers,	 no	 electricity.	 Your	 whole	 country	 lies	 in	 ruin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Waiting	for	a	catalyst.	I’m	here	to	tell	you	that	that	catalyst	is	you.	It’s	up	to	all of	us	to	lean	in	and	help	get	this	island	and	this	country	back	online,	to	learn	new skills	 and	 to	 train	 others	 to	 do	 what’s	 needed.	 That	 effort	 starts	 right	 here tonight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anders	 stood	 and	 cheered,	 raising	 his	 half-empty	 glass	 of	 vodka	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lieutenant,	inviting	others	around	him	to	join	in	the	toast.	His	fellow	table	guests remained	seated,	frowning	at	his	drunken	interruption. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	good	friend	Captain	Bjørklund	has	agreed	to	provide	whatever	support</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 can	 offer.	 Through	 God’s	 grace,	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Maersk	 Charlotte</i>	 is	 anchored	 not	 five miles	from	here,	fully	loaded	with	humanitarian	aid	that	was	en	route	to	Sierra</p>
<p class="calibre1">Leone.	 I’m	 told	 the	 ship’s	 manifest	 lists	 temporary	 shelters,	 tents,	 medical supplies,	 rice,	 dried	 food,	 bottled	 water,	 vehicles	 and	 more.	 Of	 course,	 we	 still</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>need	to	find	a	way	to	unload	the	containers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lieutenant	led	a	round	of	applause	for	Anders,	who	acknowledged	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">appreciation	with	a	wobbly	bow	and	his	best	attempt	at	a	salute.	Peterson	turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	attention	to	Captain	Armstrong.	“In	addition	to	the	 <i class="calibre4">Charlotte</i>	we	are	working hand	 in	 hand	 with	 our	 friends	 in	 the	 Royal	 Navy.	 Captain	 Armstrong,	 over	 to you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 British	 officer	 rose	 slowly	 and	 adjusted	 his	 starched	 collar	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">straightened	his	bow	tie.	“Ladies	and	gentlemen,	I	know	we’d	all	like	to	express</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	appreciation	to	Lieutenant	Peterson.	I	am	confident	that	the	arrival	of	the	US</p>
<p class="calibre1">Navy	will	tip	the	balance	back	in	our	favour.	At	Portsmouth	naval	base,	we	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	shortage	of	hardware	but	we	have	very	few	trained	personnel.	With	your	help</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	can	make	use	of	the	vast	resources	that	lie	mothballed	in	our	dockyards	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">stores.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	small	movement	to	Jack’s	right	caught	his	eye.	A	shadow	passing	an	open</p>
<p class="calibre1">doorway,	 a	 face	 darting	 from	 view.	 Jack	 thought	 nothing	 of	 it	 and	 turned	 his attention	back	to	Captain	Armstrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our	first	priority	is	to	establish	Camp	Wight	as	a	refugee	centre	capable	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">accommodating	many	thousands,	if	not	tens	of	thousands,	of	survivors.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 walked	 over	 to	 a	 detailed	 map	 of	 the	 Isle	 of	 Wight	 which	 had	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">crudely	pinned	next	to	a	portrait	of	a	nineteenth-century	nobleman	on	horseback. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	grabbed	a	billiards	cue	that	was	leaning	next	to	the	wall	and	pointed	towards</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	eastern	end	of	the	island. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here	 at	 Ryde,	 the	 British	 will	 be	 responsible	 for	 ferrying	 survivors	 from Portsmouth	and	Gosport	to	our	Processing	Centre	Charlie,	which	will	be	capable</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	processing	up	to	five	hundred	people	at	a	time	in	quarantine	zones	here	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">here,”	he	said,	tapping	the	map	firmly	with	the	cue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 turned	 and	 gestured	 towards	 Peterson.	 “In	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 island	 at Cowes,	the	Americans	will	take	over	the	route	from	Southampton	to	Processing</p>
<p class="calibre1">Centre	Bravo.	And	last	but	not	least,	the	islanders	themselves	will	handle	Camp</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alpha	at	Yarmouth.	We	intend	to	set	up	HQ	at	St	Mary’s	Hospital	with	a	clean</p>
<p class="calibre1">zone	 to	 the	 immediate	 south,	 with	 accommodation	 for	 up	 to	 five	 thousand</p>
<p class="calibre1">people.	 New	 arrivals	 will	 be	 assessed	 based	 on	 their	 experience	 and	 skills	 then assigned	 to	 special	 units	 tasked	 with	 reconstruction,	 logistics,	 food	 production and	security,	to	name	but	a	few.	The	whole	operation	will	remain	under	military</p>
<p class="calibre1">control	until	a	functioning	civilian	government	can	be	formed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 a	 nod	 towards	 his	 British	 counterpart,	 Lieutenant	 Peterson	 took	 over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“None	 of	 us	 should	 be	 under	 any	 illusions	 that	 this	 will	 be	 easy.	 We’ll	 need	 to defend	 Camp	 Wight,	 day	 and	 night,	 to	 ensure	 no	 craft	 approaches	 the	 island without	 authorisation.	 Our	 friends	 at	 Hurst	 will	 set	 up	 a	 blockade	 to	 prevent</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>unauthorised	 vessels	 from	 entering	 the	 protected	 zone,	 while	 the	 eastern approaches	will	be	patrolled	by	the	Royal	Navy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	should	any	other	group	take	an	unwanted	interest	in	Camp	Wight,	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	well	able	to	defend	ourselves.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	host	sitting	at	the	head	of	the	table	led	another	round	of	applause	as	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">guests	nodded	and	murmured	their	approval	of	the	outline	plans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	 Armstrong	 continued,	 “Ladies	 and	 gentlemen,	 we	 start	 work	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning,	 meaning	 tonight	 is	 for	 celebration.	 So	 please	 charge	 your	 glasses.	 I give	you	Camp	Wight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 chairs	 scraped	 back	 and	 everyone	 stood,	 the	 dinner	 guests	 repeated	 in unison,	“Camp	Wight”	before	finishing	their	drinks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terra	caught	Jack’s	eye,	mouthing	“Wow”.	Jack	smiled	and	raised	his	empty</p>
<p class="calibre1">glass	in	a	silent	toast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peterson	 introduced	 a	 scientist	 with	 wiry	 grey	 hair	 from	 the	 University	 of Southampton’s	 Centre	 for	 Biological	 Science.	 Professor	 Nichols	 pushed	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">glasses	 higher	 up	 the	 bridge	 of	 his	 nose	 and	 addressed	 the	 room	 in	 a	 faltering voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“From	 what	 I	 have	 observed,	 the	 Millennial	 Virus	 shares	 many	 similarities with	 the	 Spanish	 flu	 pandemic	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 First	 World	 War.	 Spanish	 flu infected	close	to	one	billion	people	and	was	responsible	for	somewhere	between</p>
<p class="calibre1">fifty	million	to	one	hundred	million	deaths.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	paused	while	his	audience	nodded	and	waited	for	him	to	continue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 latest	 strain	 of	 the	 flu	 virus	 is	 an	 even	 more	 effective	 killer.	 It	 passes quickly	 from	 person	 to	 person.	 Different	 strains	 make	 prevention	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">immunisation	 programmes	 difficult.	 The	 virus	 is	 capable	 of	 adapting	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">bypassing	 the	 body’s	 immune	 system	 and,	 so	 far,	 has	 proven	 resistant	 to	 all known	 treatments.	 Without	 the	 facilities	 or	 staff	 to	 undertake	 a	 proper	 medical study,	our	best	chance	is	to	avoid	all	contact	with	the	virus	and	to	maintain	strict quarantine	 for	 new	 arrivals.	 I’ve	 volunteered	 to	 lead	 a	 newly	 formed	 research team	at	St	Mary’s	Hospital	just	up	the	road	in	Cowes.	Providing	the	military	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">provide	 us	 with	 the	 necessary	 resources	 there	 is	 no	 reason	 why	 we	 can't commence	 trials	 for	 a	 vaccine.	 Although	 I	 would	 caution	 that	 this	 could	 take several	years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly,	 there	 was	 a	 scuffle	 at	 the	 back	 of	 the	 room.	 Raised	 voices	 heard above	the	dinner	table	chatter.	A	muffled	cry	from	one	of	the	guards	as	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">unceremoniously	dumped	on	the	floor.	He	clutched	at	his	throat,	spluttering	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">breath,	 blood	 pouring	 from	 between	 his	 fingers.	 A	 figure	 wearing	 a	 balaclava stepped	from	the	shadows	and	took	up	position	by	the	entrance,	a	knife	glinting</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	his	right	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>Jack	stood	and	shouted	at	the	guards	by	the	other	doorway	but	it	was	already too	late.	They	were	wrestled	to	the	ground	and	dragged	from	sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Thirty-three</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	tall	heavy-set	figure	in	a	grey	T-shirt	advanced	menacingly	towards	Peterson</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 Armstrong.	 Two	 henchmen	 kept	 pace	 just	 behind,	 brandishing	 shotguns	 to deter	 any	 wannabe	 heroes.	 The	 two	 navy	 officers	 were	 unarmed	 and	 stood</p>
<p class="calibre1">perfectly	still. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everybody	shut	up	and	sit	down.	Jamie,	you’re	on	crowd	control.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	British	officer	seemed	undaunted,	studying	his	adversary	as	he	waved	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">matt	 black	 pistol	 lazily	 between	 their	 heads.	 The	 man’s	 arms	 and	 neck	 were richly	 tattooed	 with	 intricate	 patterns,	 passages	 of	 text	 and	 colourful	 scenes	 of snakes,	swords	and	full-breasted	women. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don’t	 remember	 seeing	 your	 name	 on	 the	 guest	 list.	 Who	 are	 you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">challenged	Armstrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never	 you	 mind,	 navy	 boy.”	 He	 looked	 around	 the	 room	 at	 a	 sea	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">frightened	 faces,	 Jack’s	 included.	 A	 few	 of	 the	 guests	 recognised	 the	 heavily tattooed	 man,	 whispering	 his	 name	 under	 their	 breath	 as	 if	 his	 reputation preceded	him.	Briggs	nodded,	pointing	the	gun	towards	the	whispers,	wagging	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">finger	in	disapproval. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	one	thought	to	invite	Briggs,	eh?”	He	tutted.	“Shame	on	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	you’re	Briggs,”	interrupted	Peterson	quietly,	puffing	out	his	chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	found	the	American’s	expression	hard	to	read.	Peterson	had	clearly	met</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	fair	share	of	bullies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Career	criminal,	barrow	boy	turned	gangster.	Your	file	said	you	were	serving</p>
<p class="calibre1">eighteen	 years	 for	 armed	 robbery	 before	 some	 well-meaning	 genius	 cut	 you</p>
<p class="calibre1">loose,	 together	 with	 all	 the	 other	 inmates	 of	 Park	 Hurst	 prison	 who	 survived,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said	Peterson	without	blinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Call	it	time	off	for	good	behaviour.	So	you’re	the	septic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peterson	looked	puzzled,	pretending	to	be	unfamiliar	with	this	provocation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	forgot	you’re	not	from	around	here.	Septic	tank?	Rhymes	with	Yank,”	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">sneered.	“Bit	far	from	home,	aren't	you?	This	ain’t	your	turf,	mate.	You’ve	got</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	 place	 ordering	 people	 around.	 Haven’t	 you	 heard?	 I	 run	 things	 round	 here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	want	something,	then	you	talk	to	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 a	 murmur	 from	 the	 guests	 that	 he	 silenced	 with	 a	 raised	 finger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shut	it.	I’ve	had	enough	of	you	lot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>“Then	may	I	suggest	you	go	back	to	whatever	hole	you	just	crawled	from?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">interrupted	the	captain,	attempting	to	reassert	his	authority.	“This	whole	island	is under	military	control.	You	have	no	right	to	be	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Briggs	laughed,	turning	away	and	shaking	his	head	before	looking	back	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	deadpan	expression.	“Who	put	you	jokers	in	charge,	eh?	I	couldn’t	give	a	toss</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	you	think.	Nothing’s	going	to	happen	on	this	island	without	my	say-so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Briggs	 wandered	 between	 the	 tables,	 eyeballing	 the	 other	 dinner	 guests	 in their	 dusty	 mothballed	 finery.	 He	 stopped	 behind	 one	 of	 the	 island	 leaders,	 a portly	 man	 with	 a	 red	 face,	 and	 reached	 for	 a	 half-eaten	 roast	 potato,	 mopping the	 gravy	 from	 the	 plate.	 He	 chewed	 noisily	 with	 his	 mouth	 open,	 licking	 his fingers.	 He	 placed	 a	 hand	 on	 each	 of	 the	 man’s	 shoulders	 and	 began	 kneading the	 back	 of	 his	 neck.	 The	 islander	 was	 perspiring	 heavily,	 beads	 of	 sweat forming	 on	 his	 forehead.	 He	 glanced	 from	 side	 to	 side	 at	 his	 fellow	 guests, appealing	for	their	support. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Briggs	 grabbed	 a	 fork	 and	 in	 one	 fluid	 movement	 jammed	 it	 down	 into	 the man’s	 hand,	 embedding	 it	 in	 the	 plump	 flesh.	 Briggs	 ignored	 the	 man’s	 high-pitched	 wail	 and	 snaked	 a	 thick	 tattooed	 arm	 around	 his	 neck,	 dragging	 him backwards	off	his	chair.	The	man	kicked	helplessly,	ruffling	an	ornate	rug	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 neatly	 polished	 brogues.	 Briggs	 dumped	 him	 on	 the	 ground	 and	 raised	 his pistol. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Want	 to	 know	 what	 happens	 to	 people	 who	 double-cross	 me?	 You	 lied, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bairstow.	You	think	because	we’re	convicts,	we’re	all	stupid,	do	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fat	man	on	the	ground	was	shaking	his	head,	his	hands	raised	in	defence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	you	do	a	deal	with	Briggs,	you	pay	up,	or	bad	stuff	tends	to	happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	you’re	going	to	get	what’s	coming	to	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	fired	a	single	shot	and	the	man	bent	double,	clutching	at	his	abdomen.	A</p>
<p class="calibre1">sad,	 almost	 disappointed	 expression	 settled	 in	 his	 eyes	 as	 a	 red	 stain	 formed around	his	midriff	and	his	body	went	limp.	There	were	gasps	of	disbelief	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 dinner	 guests,	 who	 recoiled	 in	 horror,	 pushing	 their	 chairs	 away	 from	 the blood	that	began	to	pool	around	his	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	 Armstrong	 stepped	 forward,	 spitting	 with	 indignation,	 pointing</p>
<p class="calibre1">angrily	at	Briggs.	“That’s	brave.	Shooting	an	unarmed	man.	You	coward.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Briggs	parried	his	intrusion,	pistol-whipping	the	naval	officer	across	the	face, </p>
<p class="calibre1">leaving	a	bloody	streak	across	his	cheek.	Armstrong	fished	a	white	handkerchief</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	his	trouser	pocket	and	pressed	it	to	his	face	to	staunch	the	flow	of	blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 and	 who’s	 army?	 All	 your	 men	 are	 dead,	 captain.”	 He	 laughed	 in	 his face.	 “You	 really	 think	 a	 bunch	 of	 sailor	 boys	 can	 match	 my	 army	 of	 street fighters	and	career	criminals?	I	don’t	think	so.	I’d	take	one	of	my	boys	for	ten	of yours.	I’ve	spent	eight	long	years	on	this	bloody	island.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>Peterson	placed	himself	between	Briggs	and	Captain	Armstrong.	“You	should know	 that	 I’ve	 dealt	 with	 Somali	 warlords,	 drug	 barons	 in	 Columbia,	 guerrilla fighters	 in	 Syria,	 Afghanistan,	 and	 Iraq.	 You’re	 a	 bunch	 of	 convicts	 with shotguns,	 nothing	 more.	 I	 have	 a	 Navy	 Seal	 team	 expert	 in	 weapons,	 tactics, counter-terrorism	 and	 explosives	 I	 can	 summon	 at	 a	 moment’s	 notice.”	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">clicked	his	fingers.	“I	have	drones	that	can	hunt	you	down	when	you	least	expect</p>
<p class="calibre1">it.	Precision	weapons	that	can	take	out	a	vehicle	travelling	at	50mph.	Trust	me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">mate,”	he	said	the	word	“mate”	in	as	good	a	cockney	accent	as	he	could	manage, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“you	don’t	have	a	hope	in	hell.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	 take	 my	 chances.	 You	 really	 want	 a	 war	 you	 can’t	 win?	 My	 lot</p>
<p class="calibre1">sabotaging	your	relief	effort	at	every	opportunity?	Smuggling	sick	people	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	mainland	and	letting	them	loose	in	your	precious	Camp	Wight?	Do	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen,	Briggs,	this	virus	is	bigger	than	any	local	feud.	It’s	too	important	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">petty	squabbles	to	interfere.	We’re	facing	an	extinction	event	for	humanity.	Total</p>
<p class="calibre1">annihilation.	 Please,	 lay	 down	 your	 weapons	 and	 join	 us.	 You	 can’t	 win,	 you know	that.	And	there	will	be	plenty	of	other	battles	to	fight.	I’m	sure	we	can	find suitable	jobs	for	your	men	that	would	keep	them,	how	shall	we	say,	entertained.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Briggs	came	and	stood	with	his	nose	almost	touching	the	American’s,	a	snarl</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	his	lips.	“You	really	think	we	want	anything	to	do	with	your	lot?	Don’t	waste</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	breath.	Why	doesn’t	everyone	sit	down	and	make	themselves	comfortable, </p>
<p class="calibre1">shall	we?	We’re	going	to	work	out	a	different	kind	of	deal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Out	of	sight,	within	Lieutenant	Peterson’s	trouser	pocket,	a	micro-transmitter</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 flashing	 red,	 broadcasting	 a	 distress	 signal.	 Every	 sixty	 seconds	 it	 buzzed lightly	against	his	trouser	leg	to	confirm	its	activation.	Even	now	a	rescue	team</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	a	high	state	of	readiness	would	be	scrambling,	ready	to	be	on	site	in	less	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">ten	minutes. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Sam’s	curiosity	had	got	the	better	of	him	and	he’d	ignored	Jack’s	instruction	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">stay	with	the	boat.	He	was	crouched	behind	a	hydrangea	bush,	peering	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	grand	window	of	the	stateroom	where	they	were	holding	Jack	and	the	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	nothing	he	could	do	but	watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	caught	some	of	the	conversation	whenever	the	tattooed	man	in	the	T-shirt</p>
<p class="calibre1">approached	 the	 window	 or	 when	 the	 wind	 dropped	 and	 the	 trees	 grew	 still.	 He noticed	a	guard	bound	and	gagged	by	the	main	entrance	with	a	swarthy-looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">guy	 standing	 over	 him,	 keeping	 an	 eye	 out	 for	 any	 late	 arrivals	 to	 the	 Osborne gathering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	racked	his	brains.	What	could	he	do?	Light	a	fire?	Cause	a	distraction? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Set	off	the	fire	alarm	and	then	try	and	steal	into	the	room	unseen?	He	gripped	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">old	 service	 revolver	 Jack	 had	 entrusted	 him	 with.	 It	 was	 a	 useful	 deterrent	 if nothing	else.	It	deserved	to	be	in	a	museum,	which	ironically	was	exactly	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 had	 found	 the	 weapon,	 along	 with	 muskets,	 suits	 of	 armour,	 swords	 and instruments	of	torture	salvaged	from	nearly	five	hundred	years	of	history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 distance	 Sam	 heard	 a	 faint	 mechanical	 sound	 but	 it	 was	 gone	 again before	he	could	locate	its	source.	It	sounded	close	and	far	away,	all	at	the	same</p>
<p class="calibre1">time.	It	was	nearly	dark	outside	and,	with	his	back	to	the	bush,	he	was	fairly	sure he	 couldn’t	 be	 seen.	 He	 had	 no	 idea	 what	 was	 going	 on	 in	 the	 stateroom,	 but from	 the	 looks	 on	 people’s	 faces,	 they	 were	 scared.	 The	 man	 with	 the	 tattoos paced	around	the	room,	jabbing	his	finger	in	people’s	faces,	lecturing	someone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	kept	watch	for	some	time,	pondering	his	next	move.	He	was	straining	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear	what	was	being	said	when	footsteps	behind	him	made	him	freeze.	Without</p>
<p class="calibre1">disturbing	 the	 flower	 heads,	 all	 he	 could	 make	 out	 from	 his	 cramped	 position, were	dark	shadows	advancing	deliberately	towards	him,	their	faces	obscured	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">helmets	and	goggles.	They	moved	fluidly	as	one	connected	organism,	taking	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">position	with	their	backs	against	the	brick	wall	of	the	building.	Sam	was	only	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">few	feet	away	holding	his	breath,	hoping	he	was	invisible	in	the	half-light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	 of	 the	 men	 walked	 straight	 up	 to	 the	 bush	 where	 Sam	 was	 crouched</p>
<p class="calibre1">within	 and	 put	 his	 finger	 to	 his	 lips.	 He	 removed	 his	 headset	 and	 gestured	 for Sam	 to	 come	 out	 from	 his	 hiding	 place.	 Sam	 dropped	 the	 gun	 and	 came	 out, holding	 his	 hands	 up.	 The	 soldier	 grabbed	 him,	 spun	 him	 round	 and	 roughly</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>pushed	him	down	on	to	his	knees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 drew	 Sam’s	 arms	 behind	 his	 back	 and	 secured	 both	 hands	 together	 with what	 felt	 like	 a	 cable	 tie,	 doing	 the	 same	 with	 his	 legs.	 The	 soldier	 stuffed	 a piece	of	cloth	in	Sam’s	mouth	and	whispered	in	his	ear.	“Stay	down	and	you’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	fine.	Don’t	move,	okay?”	Sam	nodded,	reassured	by	the	American	accent	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	were	friendly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	saw	them	move	off	towards	the	main	entrance.	A	few	seconds	later	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard	 the	 soft	 pop	 of	 a	 silenced	 weapon	 as	 the	 guard	 went	 down.	 One	 of	 the team	caught	the	guard’s	body	and	weapon	before	it	could	clatter	on	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	team	moved	out	of	sight,	heading	inside.	Sam	whispered	a	silent	prayer</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	he	lay	prone	on	the	ground,	incapacitated.	The	grass	was	already	damp	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">evening	 dew.	 A	 loud	 explosion	 made	 the	 windows	 rattle	 but	 not	 shatter.	 An American	voice	shouted,	“Lay	down	your	weapons	and	surrender.”	A	volley	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">small	 arms	 fire	 answered	 their	 demands.	 Sam	 craned	 his	 neck	 towards	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">window,	 desperate	 to	 see	 what	 was	 happening.	 He	 could	 see	 smoke	 and	 bright flashes,	then	all	the	lights	went	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 half-light,	 Briggs’s	 men	 didn’t	 stand	 a	 chance	 against	 highly	 trained soldiers	 with	 night-vision	 goggles.	 The	 window	 nearest	 Sam	 shattered	 into	 a thousand	 pieces	 as	 a	 grenade	 exploded	 nearby.	 He	 was	 stunned	 for	 a	 few</p>
<p class="calibre1">seconds,	his	ears	ringing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 fire	 fight	 seemed	 to	 move	 to	 a	 different	 part	 of	 the	 building	 and	 then grew	louder	outside	beyond	view,	heading	into	the	woods,	away	from	where	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hostages	 were	 being	 held.	 Perhaps	 a	 few	 of	 the	 terrorists,	 if	 that’s	 what	 they were,	had	gotten	away,	thought	Sam.	There	were	several	further	shotgun	blasts</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	inside,	a	heart-rending	scream	and	then	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 what	 seemed	 like	 an	 eternity,	 the	 soldiers	 re-emerged,	 escorting</p>
<p class="calibre1">Peterson	 and	 two	 others	 to	 safety,	 lowering	 them	 down	 next	 to	 the	 wall	 by	 the front	entrance.	Sam	couldn’t	see	their	faces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	soldier	who	had	bound	Sam	jogged	over	and	flashed	a	torch	in	his	face</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	removing	the	gag	from	his	mouth.	“Talk	fast.	Who	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	name’s	Sam,”	he	replied,	his	voice	cracking.	“I’m	one	of	the	good	guys, </p>
<p class="calibre1">came	here	with	Jack	and	Terra	from	Hurst	Castle.	They’re	my	friends.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 soldier	 dumped	 him	 back	 on	 the	 floor	 and	 double-timed	 it	 over	 to	 the main	group,	where	a	medic	was	checking	the	hostages	and	treating	their	injuries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	spoke	in	a	low	voice	with	his	sergeant	and	Lieutenant	Peterson	who	nodded</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	Sam’s	direction.	The	soldier	relaxed	a	little	and	wandered	back,	flicking	open</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 knife	 to	 cut	 the	 ties	 securing	 Sam’s	 hands	 and	 legs,	 hauling	 him	 back	 to	 his feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing	personal,	just	doing	my	job.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>Sam	nodded.	The	blood	was	rushing	back	to	his	extremities	and	he	felt	a	little faint	but	unharmed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	 someone	 over	 here	 wants	 to	 talk	 to	 you,	 will	 you	 come	 with	 me, sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	followed	the	soldier,	his	legs	stiff	and	leaden.	He	spotted	Jack	propped</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	 against	 another	 hostage	 and	 bent	 down	 to	 comfort	 him.	 Jack	 looked	 a	 bit bashed	up,	with	a	blackened	face,	split	lip,	and	blood	soaked	down	his	right	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peterson	interrupted	their	reunion.	“Gentlemen,	I	suggest	you	come	with	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 can’t	 vouch	 for	 your	 safety	 here.	 Briggs’s	 men	 were	 easily	 scared	 off	 but they’re	likely	to	come	back	in	greater	numbers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 looked	 up	 with	 fire	 in	 his	 eyes.	 “Wait,	 what	 about	 Terra?”	 he	 said, seizing	hold	of	Peterson’s	arm,	to	the	protestation	of	the	medic	trying	to	dress	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cut	on	Jack’s	forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peterson	looked	confused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 continued,	 “Terra?	 The	 woman	 I	 came	 here	 with?	 What	 happened	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">her?	We	need	to	go	back	and	look	for	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jack,	there’s	no	time.	Listen…”	He	took	a	deep	breath,	choosing	his	words</p>
<p class="calibre1">carefully.	“I	saw	her.	Briggs	took	her,	along	with	some	of	the	others.	We	couldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	to	her.	I’m	sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	looked	exhausted	and	distressed.	“Will	she	be	okay?	I	couldn’t	take	it	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	did	something	to	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 can’t	 promise	 you	 that,”	 said	 Peterson,	 shaking	 his	 head.	 “But	 if	 they’ve got	any	sense	they’ll	look	after	her	and	make	a	trade.	We’ve	captured	a	couple	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">theirs.	She’s	a	smart	lady,	Jack.	She’ll	do	what	it	takes	to	stay	alive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peterson	turned	towards	the	special	forces	team	leader.	“Sergeant	Jones,	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">team	 stay	 behind	 to	 secure	 the	 area	 and	 help	 with	 the	 clean-up.	 I’ll	 take	 Jack back	to	the	ship	to	get	patched	up.	Sam,	you	want	to	tag	along	and	keep	the	old</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	company?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	 nodded	 enthusiastically	 and	 they	 both	 followed	 Peterson	 and	 his	 men</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	 the	 wood	 behind	 the	 house,	 across	 a	 golf	 course	 and	 down	 a	 slope towards	 a	 hidden	 valley	 where	 the	 helicopter	 had	 landed	 to	 maintain	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">advantage	of	surprise	and	stealth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	 put	 his	 arm	 around	 Jack’s	 shoulders,	 supporting	 his	 weight.	 “I’m	 sure she’ll	be	fine.	Have	faith.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 shook	 his	 head.	 “You	 didn’t	 see	 this	 guy,	 Sam.	 He’s	 delusional,	 thinks the	island	belongs	to	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	a	survivor,”	reassured	Sam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack’s	 chest	 was	 wracked	 by	 another	 coughing	 fit.	 The	 medic	 said	 it	 was smoke	 inhalation.	 They	 limped	 a	 few	 feet	 behind	 the	 others	 to	 find	 their	 ride</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a>back	to	the	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Thirty-five</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	was	dreaming.	It	was	a	fitful,	restless	sort	of	sleep	he’d	been	trying	to	wake</p>
<p class="calibre1">from.	 It	 was	 as	 if	 he	 was	 trying	 to	 climb	 out	 of	 a	 giant	 Petri	 dish	 with	 smooth slippery	sides.	Every	time	he	nearly	reached	the	top,	he’d	lose	his	grip	and	slide</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	down	again.	The	pit	was	an	inferno,	sweat	dripped	from	the	tip	of	his	nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drip,	 drip,	 drip.	 It	 wouldn’t	 stop.	 His	 skin	 was	 prickling,	 pulsating	 with	 sores that	appeared	and	disappeared	on	his	hands	and	forearms.	He	steeled	himself	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	time	and	clambered	up	the	contour-less	surface.	His	palms	were	damp	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">perspiration.	 There	 was	 a	 tingling	 sensation	 in	 his	 fingertips.	 Just	 as	 he	 felt himself	begin	to	slide	back	down,	he	thrust	his	hand	into	the	air,	stretching	every sinew.	A	woman’s	hand	grabbed	his	and	pulled	him	clear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 opened	 his	 eyes	 and	 found	 Riley	 sitting	 patiently	 by	 his	 bedside.	 She looked	so	peaceful.	Her	eyes	were	closed.	He	gingerly	flexed	his	fingers	and	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">wave	 of	 pain	 shot	 up	 to	 his	 shoulder,	 making	 him	 wince.	 The	 bandages	 were clean	and	blood-free.	The	pain	felt	strangely	reassuring.	A	reminder	he	was	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">alive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 placed	 Zed’s	 hand	 back	 down	 on	 the	 bed	 sheet	 and	 went	 to	 find	 the nurse.	His	throat	was	parched,	his	lips	cracked	and	blistered.	There	was	a	glass</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	water	on	the	bedside	table	which	he	drained	in	one	gulp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 nurse	 bustled	 back	 into	 the	 room.	 She	 fumbled	 in	 her	 top	 pocket	 and inserted	a	digital	thermometer	into	his	right	ear,	waiting	for	the	electronic	beep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	99.4	degrees,”	said	the	nurse,	showing	the	read-out	to	Riley.	“His	fever	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">come	right	down.	We’ll	keep	you	in	one	more	night.	You’ll	be	back	on	your	feet</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	morning,	dear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 thanked	 the	 nurse	 who	 seemed	 distracted,	 staring	 blankly	 over	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulder	before	turning	brusquely	to	leave.	Riley	poured	another	glass	of	water</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	handed	it	to	Zed,	waiting	for	him	to	drain	it	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	gave	us	quite	a	scare	collapsing	like	that.	Looks	like	you’re	not	quite	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">indestructible	as	we	thought.	Human	after	all	then?”	joked	Riley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	remember	much	after	we	got	here.	How	long	was	I	out?”	asked	Zed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 checked	 her	 watch,	 a	 black	 plastic-looking	 Casio	 she	 never	 took	 off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	been	asleep	for	about	eighteen	hours	straight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	raised	a	single	eyebrow	quizzically.	The	dividing	lines	between	dream	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>reality	had	become	blurred.	With	the	drugs,	he	was	no	longer	sure	what	was	real and	what	was	imagined.	It	was	all	rather	disconcerting.	“The	fever	gave	me	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">worst	 dreams.	 I’m	 sincerely	 hoping	 that	 the	 three	 witches	 who	 have	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">tormenting	me	in	my	sleep	are	not	real.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 the	 sisters	 are	 all	 too	 real,	 I’m	 afraid.	 You	 don’t	 know	 the	 half	 of	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone’s	 terrified	 of	 them.	 They’re	 trying	 to	 force	 Stella	 to	 stay.	 They	 say she’s	part	of	some	weird	cult	breeding	programme,	that	she’s	pregnant.	Oh,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	they’ve	got	Joe	locked	up	because	he	can’t	be	trusted	around	all	these	sex-</p>
<p class="calibre1">starved	women.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’ll	be	loving	all	the	attention.	He’s	never	had	much	luck	with	the	ladies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	tried	to	sit	up	straight	but	the	strain	on	his	face	was	palpable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	 hey,	 easy,	 fella.	 You	 need	 to	 rest	 up.	 Avoid	 tiring	 yourself	 out.	 I brought	some	reading	material	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	dumped	the	small	pile	of	well-thumbed	magazines	on	the	bedside	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 picked	 up	 the	 top	 one.	 Its	 cover	 was	 ringed	 with	 stains	 from	 half	 a	 dozen coffee	cups.	He	flicked	through	grainy	images	of	half-remembered	celebrities	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">swimwear	 photos,	 shot	 through	 telephoto	 lenses	 by	 the	 paparazzi.	 Page	 after page	of	smug	fake-tan	couples	posing	in	front	of	replica	Greek	columns	outside</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 country	 houses,	 dripping	 in	 gold	 jewellery.	 Precocious	 young	 children dressed	in	Ralph	Lauren.	The	upper	classes	playing	polo	on	horseback	watched</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	minor	royalty.	He	turned	on	his	side,	shaking	his	head	in	disgust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	it’s	better	than	nothing,”	said	Riley.	“The	only	other	thing	I	could	find</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	copies	of	the	Bible	and	I	didn’t	think	you’d	want	that.”	She	went	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 stack	 and	 found	 what	 she	 was	 looking	 for,	 a	 vintage	  <i class="calibre4">Top	 Gear</i>	 magazine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 is	 probably	 more	 your	 thing.	 Nuns	 on	 bikes,	 special	 on	 the	 Stig	 and	 an interview	with	Richard	Hammond	himself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed’s	 face	 was	 pale,	 his	 skin	 drawn	 and	 paper-thin.	 He	 looked	 much	 older with	grey	circles	under	his	clear	blue	eyes	and	two	days’	worth	of	stubble,	giving</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	a	lived-in	look	that	Riley	said	she	found	pleasing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	flicked	through	the	pages	of	Ferraris	and	Lamborghinis,	reasonably	priced</p>
<p class="calibre1">cars	 and	 beautiful	 landscapes,	 burned	 rubber,	 winding	 roads,	 tarmac	 stretching into	the	distance.	The	colour	seemed	to	flood	back	into	his	cheeks	as	memories</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	rushing	back	like	soothing	waves	of	sound.	The	corner	of	his	mouth	turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">upwards.	“I	used	to	love	that	show.	Seems	like	a	long	time	ago,	doesn't	it?”	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaned	 back	 and	 sighed.	 “To	 think	 people	 back	 then	 were	 so	 obsessed	 with material	 possessions	 like	 cars,	 houses,	 clothes	 and	 gadgets.	 Remember	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shopping	channels	on	TV?	Full	of	chintz.	How	could	normal	sane	people	spend</p>
<p class="calibre1">hours	gossiping	about	celebrities,	who’s	dating	who,	who’s	wearing	what?	It	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	so	trivial,	just	tittle	tattle	for	the	masses.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>He	 rolled	 on	 his	 back	 and	 turned	 towards	 Riley,	 suddenly	 aware	 of	 how heavy	his	head	felt,	leaning	back	against	the	pillow.	He	gazed	deep	into	her	grey-green	eyes,	a	serious	world-weary	look	on	his	face.	It	was	like	the	accumulated</p>
<p class="calibre1">strain	of	the	last	few	months	had	caught	up	with	him	and	he	had	given	in	to	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">exhaustion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	everything	I	detested,	Riley.	It	was	all	so	superficial.	Don’t	you	look</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	 now	 and	 wonder	 what	 it	 was	 all	 about?	 None	 of	 it	 mattered.	 It	 was	 just stuff.	 It	 felt	 like	 some	 people’s	 lives	 were	 a	 shallow	 veneer,	 a	 topcoat	 that masked	 something	 rotten	 just	 below	 the	 surface.	 Scratch	 your	 fingernail	 across the	paint	and	the	truth	revealed	itself.	You	realised	that	your	whole	existence	was skin-deep.	 Beyond	 the	 routine	 of	 work	 and	 life,	 there	 was	 just	 a	 hollow emptiness.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	had	never	heard	him	talk	like	this.	They	had	spent	a	lot	of	time	together</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 road	 or	 back	 at	 camp.	 Zed	 was	 not	 normally	 one	 for	 soul-searching	 or philosophising. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everyone	 needs	 someone	 or	 something,”	 agreed	 Riley.	 “If	 you	 don’t	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">that,	then	sure,	life	can	feel	quite	empty	at	times.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 encouraged	 him	 to	 go	 on.	 After	 a	 short	 pause,	 lost	 in	 his	 thoughts,	 he continued	 staring	 up	 at	 a	 stain	 on	 the	 ceiling	 where	 water	 had	 discoloured	 the paintwork. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Back	then	I	had	a	wife	and	family,	you	know.	Living	in	Croydon.	It	was	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">own	fault.”	He	paused,	swallowing	hard.	“I	made	some	poor	choices,	took	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 granted,	 put	 my	 work	 first.	 I	 came	 home	 one	 day	 and	 they	 were	 gone.	 No note,	no	forwarding	address.	I	had	no	idea	she	was	even	unhappy.	Should	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">realised.	 Then	 all	 this	 happened	 with	 the	 virus.	 Times	 like	 this,	 I	 find	 myself thinking	 about	 them,	 where	 they	 ended	 up,	 wondering	 what	 I	 would	 do</p>
<p class="calibre1">differently.	Whether	they’d	still	be	alive	if	we’d	all	stayed	together.	But	it’s	too painful.	Knowing	I	wasn’t	there	when	it	mattered…”	His	voice	faded	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	 we’ve	 all	 lost	 people,	 yeah?	 It’s	 best	 not	 to	 think	 about	 it.	 Anyway, you’ve	got	a	new	family	now	at	Hurst.	A	new	start.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 nodded	 weakly,	 still	 lost	 in	 his	 memories.	 “You	 think	 everything’s	 fine, until	 it’s	 not.”	 He	 took	 another	 sip	 of	 water,	 swallowing	 painfully.	 “Do	 you remember	 the	 London	 riots	 back	 in	 2011	 just	 before	 the	 Olympics?”	 he	 asked, pausing	 before	 continuing.	 “People	 I	 knew	 thought	 that	 was	 the	 start	 of	 the revolution,	 that	 the	 working	 classes	 were	 ready	 to	 rise	 up	 and	 tear	 it	 all	 down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Take	back	the	streets	for	the	people.	Fight	back	against	the	ruling	classes.	Reject a	life	of	poverty,	mediocrity,	subservience.	Did	I	ever	tell	you	I	was	there,	Riley? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	riot	in	Croydon,	for	God’s	sake.	I	saw	it	on	my	doorstep,	and,	suddenly,	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	 just	 so	 tangible.	 The	 social	 fabric	 stretched	 to	 breaking	 point,	 there	 within</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>touching	distance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 had	 been	 some	 time	 since	 he	 had	 thought	 about	 that	 time	 in	 his	 life.	 The world	had	been	different	back	then.	Life	had	meaning.	Between	family	and	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">work	as	a	contractor	for	the	Ministry	of	Defence,	he	had	real	purpose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 was	 living	 in	 America	 then,”	 said	 Riley,	 “but	 I	 remember	 seeing	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">summer	riots	on	the	news	and	thinking	‘How	did	that	happen?’	No	one	saw	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">coming.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 was	 terrifying	 and	 exciting	 all	 at	 the	 same	 time.	 Bit	 like	 9/11	 and	 the attack	 on	 the	 Twin	 Towers.	 A	 slow-motion	 car	 crash.	 You	 couldn’t	 look	 away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	witnessing	a	fold	in	history,	live	and	televised.	The	earth’s	rotation	knocked off	its	axis,	albeit	for	a	second.	It	was	the	same	with	the	riots,	a	moment	in	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 it’s	 gone,	 it’s	 hard	 to	 explain.	 But	 in	 the	 end	 that	 passion	 and	 fervour melted	away.	The	crowds	went	home	and	the	status	quo	resumed,	more	or	less.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 all	 just	 forgotten.	 Everything	 changed	 and	 yet	 everything	 stayed	 the	 same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No,	 I’m	 wrong,	 something	 did	 change.	 CCTV	 saw	 to	 it	 that	 all	 those	 hooded figures	 who	 helped	 themselves	 to	 the	 latest	 sportswear,	 all	 those	 ringleaders throwing	 stones	 at	 the	 police,	 all	 those	 looters	 smashing	 down	 shop	 windows and	helping	themselves	 to	flat-screen	TVs,	 were	rounded	up	 and	prosecuted.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	an	unprecedented	triumph	for	Big	Brother	and	the	state.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that	what	you	did	before	all	this	then?	Worked	for	the	government?”	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">waited	for	him	to	respond,	but	he	ignored	the	question.	“You’re	deluded	if	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">think	revolution	was	ever	going	to	happen	in	this	country.	Dream	on,	comrade.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 that’s	 where	 you’re	 wrong,	 Riley.	 This	 country	 may	 have	 the	 longest history	 of	 democracy	 of	 any	 nation,	 but	 one	 thing	 that	 made	 it	 robust	 was	 a pressure	 valve	 of	 strike	 action,	 rioting	 and	 civic	 protest.	 In	 my	 book,	 those	 are the	 hallmarks	 of	 a	 high	 functioning	 democracy.	 But	 that	 discontent	 and	 civil disobedience	 always	 fell	 short	 of	 revolution	 because	 boring	 old	 British	 reserve got	in	the	way.	Things	never	reached	their	necessary	conclusion:	a	change	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">status	 quo.	 The	 closest	 this	 country	 ever	 came	 to	 revolution	 was	 tearing	 down the	 railings	 outside	 parliament	 in	 the	 nineteenth	 century.”	 He	 shook	 his	 head with	an	ironic	smile.	“Funny	to	think	that	the	virus	did	more	to	change	the	world</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	 a	 lifetime	 of	 campaigning	 by	 socialists.	 It	 tore	 down	 the	 social	 fabric	 and replaced	it	with	mob	rule.	Who	knows	what	comes	next?	The	virus	pressed	reset</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	world	order.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 bent	 forward	 and	 straightened	 his	 pillow	 as	 he	 obligingly	 leaned</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward.	“Hey,	big	man,	less	of	the	doom	and	gloom.	All	you	need	to	do	is	focus</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	here	and	now.	That	other	stuff	will	drive	you	mad.	Concentrate	on	getting</p>
<p class="calibre1">better.	Let	someone	else	worry	about	that	other	stuff.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>“I’m	done	working	for	those	people.	They	chewed	me	up	and	spat	me	out.	I was	 just	 meat	 for	 the	 grinder.	 After	 all	 this	 time,	 I’ve	 come	 to	 realise	 that	 it’s man’s	prerogative	to	crave	power	and	to	exploit	the	weak.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	sure.	Have	you	never	wondered	where	the	virus	came	from?	Someone, </p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhere	must	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	mean	the	government?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">”There’s	a	whole	military	and	civilian	infrastructure	that	tracks	outbreaks	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">these.	 Ever	 heard	 of	 Porton	 Down?	 Up	 near	 Salisbury.	 It’s	 not	 far	 from	 here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hundreds	 of	 scientists.	 Bit	 like	 the	 CDC	 in	 Atlanta	 or	 the	 World	 Health Organization.	What	they	don’t	know	isn’t	worth	knowing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyway,	 who’s	 to	 say	 that	 the	 future	 will	 be	 the	 same	 as	 the	 past?	 The slate’s	been	wiped	clean,”	suggested	Riley,	trying	to	lighten	the	mood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“True,	but	you	can	bet	that	the	same	operating	system	reboots	and	the	status</p>
<p class="calibre1">quo	is	restored.	Everything	changes,	but	everything	stays	the	same.	What	hope	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	for	people	like	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You,	 my	 friend,	 need	 to	 get	 some	 rest.	 We’ve	 all	 been	 through	 rough</p>
<p class="calibre1">patches.	I	remember	this	one	time	when	I	was	a	teenager,	I	got	followed	home</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	school.	This	guy	came	up	behind	me	and	tried	to	throttle	me,	drag	me	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhere,	but	I	fought	back.	I	stamped	on	his	foot,	kneed	him	in	the	groin	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	ran	and	ran	until	I	got	home.	For	weeks	I	didn’t	leave	the	house.	But	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">end	I	figured	that	it	was	up	to	me.	I	never	wanted	to	feel	afraid	again,	so	I	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-defence	classes.	I	kept	fit	and	strong.	Made	sure	I	could	look	after	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	 one	 else	 is	 going	 to	 do	 that	 for	 you.	 I’ve	 never	 looked	 back.	 That	 day changed	me.	It	was	an	awakening.	Maybe	this	is	yours.	Trust	me,	the	world	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">look	a	whole	lot	better	after	a	good	night’s	sleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	forced	a	smile	and	yawned,	leaning	his	head	back	on	the	freshly	plumped</p>
<p class="calibre1">pillow.	“Maybe	you’re	right.	This	is	my	wake-up	call.	Makes	you	realise	what’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">important	and	what’s	not.	Thanks,	Riley.	For	everything.	I	owe	you.”	He	patted</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	hand	and	turned	on	his	side,	closing	his	eyes	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	 some	 sleep	 and	 shake	 off	 this	 neg-head	 bullshit.	 We	 need	 you.	 I	 need you,”	she	whispered,	but	he	was	already	fast	asleep. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
Riley	closed	the	door	quietly	behind	her.	She’d	never	seen	him	like	this.	He	had<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">been	running	on	empty	and	letting	things	get	on	top	of	him.	It	was	like	the	last</p>
<p class="calibre1">few	days	had	drained	all	that	remained	of	his	hope.	She’d	seen	it	before	during</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 time	 as	 a	 physiotherapist	 working	 with	 combat	 veterans.	 Physical	 injury</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>sometimes	impacted	a	person’s	outlook	on	the	world.	She	reassured	herself	that the	condition	was	normally	temporary.	Normally.	The	sooner	they	got	out	of	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">place,	the	better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 dinnertime	 downstairs	 and	 one	 of	 the	 sisters	 was	 ringing	 an	 old-</p>
<p class="calibre1">fashioned	brass	handbell,	summoning	all	the	residents	to	the	hall	where	they	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">laid	 out	 a	 buffet	 dinner.	 Two	 enormous	 stainless	 steel	 receptacles	 sat	 steaming, fresh	 from	 the	 kitchen.	 The	 smell	 was	 sensational.	 Fresh	 vegetable	 soup	 and	 a rich	beef	chilli	served	with	fluffy	white	basmati	rice.	Any	hot	dinner	was	one	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	savoured. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	 scrawny-looking	 women,	 with	 mean	 faces	 and	 skin	 wrinkled	 like	 old</p>
<p class="calibre1">leather,	were	slopping	generous	portions	onto	bowls	held	out	in	turn	by	the	next</p>
<p class="calibre1">person	in	line.	They	reminded	Riley	of	the	school	dinner	ladies	at	her	secondary</p>
<p class="calibre1">school,	 with	 grey	 checked	 aprons	 and	 unfashionable	 hairnets.	 One	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">younger	 girls	 was	 in	 charge	 of	 rationing	 one	 piece	 of	 bread	 and	 one	 slice	 of Victoria	 sponge	 cake	 for	 dessert.	 Apparently	 the	 cake	 was	 a	 rare	 treat,	 it	 being one	 of	 the	 women’s	 birthday	 today.	 Adele	 ran	 up	 and	 joined	 Riley	 from	 where she’d	been	sitting	with	two	other	young	girls	about	her	own	age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	 kiddo.	 What	 ya	 been	 doing?	 Staying	 clear	 of	 the	 God	 squad?”	 asked Riley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Adele	looked	puzzled.	“I	suppose.	When	are	we	getting	out	of	this	dump?	It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">so,	so	boring	here.	No	one	lets	you	do	anything.	It’s	all	‘do	this,	do	that,	don’t	do this,	 don’t	 do	 that’.	 Work,	 work,	 work.	 My	 fingers	 are	 red	 raw	 from	 peeling potatoes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	poor	thing.	Sounds	terrible.	Have	you	eaten	already?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	although	the	food’s	disgusting,”	she	said	too	loudly,	to	the	scorn	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	 of	 the	 dinner	 ladies.	 Adele	 stared	 back	 defiantly	 but	 then	 turned	 away,	 her cheeks	flushed.	Riley	carried	her	tray	to	the	far	end	of	a	long	table	where	a	group of	women	was	deep	in	conversation,	ignoring	their	presence	until	they	sat	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	saw	Zed.	He’s	feeling	a	lot	better.	Reckon	he’ll	be	fit	enough	to	move	first</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing	in	the	morning.	Have	you	seen	the	others?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stella	was	at	evening	prayers.	I	saw	Mila	outside	helping	in	the	garden.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Out	of	the	corner	of	her	eye,	she	noticed	the	Mother	Superior	heading	in	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">general	 direction.	 Her	 habit	 was	 so	 long	 she	 appeared	 to	 glide	 between	 the tables,	 pausing	 to	 make	 small	 talk,	 doing	 her	 bit	 for	 community	 relations.	 She paused	at	Riley	and	Adele’s	table,	aware	of	eyes	watching	furtively	from	all	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">surrounding	groups. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 do	 hope	 you’re	 settling	 in	 well.	 In	 time,	 I’m	 sure	 you	 will	 come	 to appreciate	how	we	run	things	round	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>“We’re	not	staying.	As	soon	as	Zed’s	better,	we’re	leaving.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	were	rather	hoping	that	you’d	decide	to	stay	for	a	little	bit	longer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	 unless	 you’ve	 softened	 your	 views	 on	 men	 in	 the	 last	 twenty-four</p>
<p class="calibre1">hours?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually,	quite	the	opposite.	Their	presence	has	provided	a	useful	reminder</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	why	we	established	this	commune	in	the	first	place:	to	provide	sanctuary	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">oppression.	Nothing	has	changed	for	any	of	us,	nor	will	it	any	time	soon,	if	that’s what	you’re	hoping.	It	was	only	your	kindness	towards	Stella	that	made	us	bend</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	 rules.	 As	 soon	 as	 your	 friend	 is	 well	 enough,	 the	 men	 must	 leave.	 As	 I’m sure	you	can	understand…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	understand,”	Riley	interrupted,	infuriated	by	the	high-handedness	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 sister.	 “I’ll	 never	 understand.”	 Those	 around	 them	 fell	 silent,	 turning	 their attention	to	their	conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	in	that	case,	perhaps	it’s	better	that	you	are	leaving.	We	have	tried	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">open	your	eyes,	but	if	you	choose	not	to	see,	then	I	cannot	help	you.	My	dear, </p>
<p class="calibre1">turning	 a	 blind	 eye	 to	 evil	 doesn’t	 make	 evil	 disappear.	 By	 ignoring	 something you	 sustain	 it.	 Until	 you	 take	 a	 stand,	 men’s	 brutality	 will	 only	 get	 worse.	 The only	 person	 you	 are	 fooling	 is	 yourself.”	 She	 turned	 and	 with	 a	 swish	 of	 her starched	habit,	she	brushed	past	them	and	was	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 clenched	 her	 fists,	 ready	 to	 explode,	 aware	 of	 others	 watching	 her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 she	 had	 regained	 control	 of	 her	 emotions	 she	 glanced	 across	 the	 table	 at Adele	 who	 was	 pulling	 a	 face	 at	 her,	 eyes-crossed	 and	 tongue	 lolling	 on	 her bottom	 lip,	 trying	 to	 make	 Riley	 laugh.	 It	 worked.	 Riley	 shook	 her	 head	 and leaned	in	to	whisper	“Silly	woman.	Who	does	she	think	she	is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 dinner,	 they	 stacked	 their	 plates,	 put	 their	 trays	 back	 in	 the	 rack	 and wandered	 outside,	 engrossed	 in	 conversation.	 Riley	 was	 telling	 Adele	 all	 about life	 at	 Hurst,	 their	 routines,	 the	 people	 she	 would	 meet,	 the	 views	 over	 the	 sea and	surrounding	coastline.	It	was	a	beautiful	clear	evening,	their	shoes	crunching</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	gravel	as	they	walked	together,	side	by	side,	Adele’s	hand	finding	Riley’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	falling	into	step	with	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 headed	 through	 the	 courtyard	 past	 several	 parked	 vehicles	 looking	 for Joe	who	was	said	to	be	in	one	of	the	outbuildings,	locked	up	with	the	other	men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 guard	 from	 earlier	 was	 sat	 outside	 the	 stable	 block,	 reading	 a	 paperback novel	 with	 embossed	 lettering	 on	 the	 front,	 some	 trashy	 romance.	 She	 raised	 a single	 finger	 to	 acknowledge	 their	 presence	 as	 she	 finished	 her	 page.	 Without saying	a	word,	she	got	slowly	to	her	feet,	beckoning	them	to	follow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 the	 back	 of	 the	 building	 block,	 along	 a	 crumbling	 old	 brick	 wall	 were some	 gabled	 doors.	 She	 wrestled	 with	 the	 padlock	 before	 unhooking	 the	 latch and	 swinging	 the	 door	 open	 just	 wide	 enough	 for	 the	 two	 visitors	 to	 squeeze</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a>through.	 As	 she	 closed	 and	 locked	 it	 again,	 she	 called	 out	 in	 a	 gruff	 voice	 that they	were	to	knock	when	they	were	done	and	she’d	come	back	and	let	them	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside	it	was	surprisingly	dark.	A	single	window	was	covered	with	cobwebs</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 years	 of	 accumulated	 grime.	 It	 took	 a	 couple	 of	 seconds	 for	 their	 eyes	 to adjust	before	locating	Joe	in	the	darkness.	He	was	lying	on	a	low	camp	bed	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	arms	behind	his	head	daydreaming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	 you	 doing,	 trouble?”	 asked	 Riley.	 She	 sat	 on	 the	 side	 of	 the	 bed, leaning	back	against	the	bare	brickwork.	A	shiver	rippled	through	her	back	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulders.	 She	 hugged	 her	 knees	 tightly.	 Adele	 kept	 her	 distance,	 seemingly unsure	of	herself	in	Joe’s	company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can’t	 complain,”	 said	 Joe	 with	 a	 sigh,	 pulling	 his	 sweater	 down	 over	 his bulging	stomach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	someone	who’s	been	locked	up	in	a	dingy	stable	you	sound	surprisingly</p>
<p class="calibre1">cheery.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiled	and	rolled	on	his	side.	There	was	an	unexpected	glow	about	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 can’t	 say	 I’ve	 ever	 been	 anywhere	 like	 this	 before.	 Not	 sure	 I	 want	 to leave	so	soon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	talking	about?	We	can’t	wait	to	get	out	of	this	dump.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 women	 here	 are	 not	 like	 any	 I’ve	 met	 before,	 just…to	 die	 for.”	 He sounded	dreamy,	as	if	he’d	just	woken	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have	you	gone	soft	in	the	head?	What	are	you	talking	about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 they’ve	 kept	 me	 pretty	 busy.	 I’ve	 barely	 had	 a	 moment	 to	 myself.	 I’m now	a	fully	signed-up	member	of	their	breeding	programme.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	laughed	in	shock.	“Please	tell	me	you’re	kidding?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope,	 not	 a	 bit	 of	 it.	 Two	 visitors	 today	 already.	 All	 wanting	 the	 same thing.”	He	put	his	arms	behind	his	head,	looking	very	pleased	with	himself.	“No</p>
<p class="calibre1">complaints	from	me.	I’ve	been	more	than	happy	to	oblige.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gross,”	said	Adele.	“That’s	disgusting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	to	me,”	said	Joe	defiantly.	“Best	thing	that’s	ever	happened.	I	feel	like	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">gigolo.	Never	had	such	fun.	Never	want	to	leave.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 look	 like	 you’ve	 died	 and	 gone	 to	 heaven,	 you	 dirty	 dog,”	 said	 Riley, laughing.	“It’s	grim,	Joe.	Don’t	you	find	it	demeaning?	It’s	borderline	inhumane</p>
<p class="calibre1">keeping	you	and	the	others	locked	up	like	this	and	being	forced	to	mate.”	He	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">smiling,	 enjoying	 her	 superciliousness,	 listening	 intently	 to	 her	 protestations	 of injustice	and	morality.	“But	hey,	I	can	see	it’s	pointless	arguing	with	you.	You’re like	a	cat	that’s	got	the	cream.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Too	right.	Beyond	my	wildest	dreams.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed,	in	spite	of	her	feelings.	Riley	told	him	about	Zed	and	the	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>“As	soon	as	Zed	is	fit	enough	to	walk,	we’re	out	of	here.	With	or	without	you.	If you	 want	 to	 stay	 here	 and	 live	 like	 this,	 fair	 play.	 But	 we	 need	 to	 get	 back	 to Hurst.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	nodded.	It	felt	like	days	since	they’d	left	Hurst,	but	in	reality	it	was	less</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	forty-eight	hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 became	 pensive,	 thinking	 about	 their	 friends	 back	 at	 the	 castle, </p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly	worried	at	how	long	they	had	been	gone.	“They’ll	be	wondering	what’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened	to	us	by	now.	Those	guys	from	the	hospital	are	sure	to	come	looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	us,	whether	they	follow	the	trail	here	or	go	straight	to	Hurst.	If	this	place	gets attacked,	we’re	all	too	vulnerable.	It’s	a	miracle	they’ve	lasted	this	long,	unless someone	is	protecting	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can’t	we	stay	a	few	more	days?	I’m	just	beginning	to	like	it	here,”	pleaded</p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can’t	live	like	this.	You’ve	got	a	job	to	do.	Back	in	the	real	world.	Hurst</p>
<p class="calibre1">needs	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	didn’t	respond,	but	he	knew	she	was	right.	“Okay,	okay.	Just	come	and	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	in	the	morning	when	you’re	ready	to	leave.	If	I’m	not	too	busy,	I	suppose	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	come	with	you,	tear	myself	away	from	all	this	hard	labour.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	the	spirit.	Enjoy	it	while	it	lasts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	patted	Joe	on	the	calf	and	sauntered	over	to	the	door.	She	lingered	for	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">second,	 taking	 in	 the	 squalor	 of	 Joe’s	 confinement,	 light	 streaming	 through	 a large	hole	from	a	knot	in	the	wood.	She	rapped	her	knuckles	loudly	on	the	stable</p>
<p class="calibre1">door	and	waited	for	the	guard	to	let	them	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See	you	tomorrow,	stud.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Thirty-six</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 ten	 o’clock	 sharp,	 the	 bell	 for	 curfew	 rang	 and	 Riley,	 Mila	 and	 Adele	 were escorted	back	to	the	drawing	room	that	served	as	their	dormitory.	Every	resident</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 expected	 to	 be	 in	 her	 own	 room,	 with	 lights	 out	 by	 ten	 thirty.	 It	 reminded Riley	of	the	summer	activity	camps	her	parents	had	sent	her	on,	but	without	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	fun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	had	been	an	enjoyable	evening	with	Riley	and	Mila	as	guests	of	honour	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 whole	 programme	 of	 entertainment	 organised	 by	 the	 Chewton	 Glen	 social</p>
<p class="calibre1">committee.	 A	 general	 knowledge	 quiz	 was	 followed	 by	 an	 open-microphone</p>
<p class="calibre1">style	 session,	 rounded	 off	 with	 a	 reading	 from	 Charles	 Dickens’s	  <i class="calibre4">Great</i> <i class="calibre4">Expectations</i>	by	a	young	girl	with	an	accomplished	theatrical	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Adele	 fell	 asleep	 on	 a	 sofa	 waiting	 for	 the	 grown-ups	 to	 finish	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversations.	Riley	struggled	to	lift	her	limp	body.	Her	skin	was	the	colour	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">milk,	 almost	 translucent	 in	 the	 dim	 light	 of	 the	 candle	 Stella	 carried,	 leading them	 back	 to	 the	 drawing	 room	 where	 they	 were	 sleeping.	 She	 made	 sure	 they still	had	blankets	and	pillows	and	then	stood	aside	as	one	of	the	guards	locked</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	in	for	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 covered	 Adele	 with	 a	 blanket	 and	 settled	 down	 into	 the	 armchair, </p>
<p class="calibre1">adjusting	 the	 cushions	 behind	 her	 head.	 She	 stared	 at	 the	 empty	 leather	 sofa where	Zed	had	slept	the	previous	night.	She	had	checked	in	on	him	again	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">dinner	 but	 he	 was	 still	 spark	 out.	 A	 plasma	 drip	 was	 attached	 to	 his	 arm, replenishing	lost	fluids.	His	complexion	was	regaining	some	of	its	usual	colour</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	the	medicine	worked	its	magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	closed	her	eyes	and	was	just	drifting	off	when	someone	started	ringing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	dinner	bell	with	an	unmistakeable	degree	of	urgency. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	going	on?”	asked	a	startled	Mila,	sitting	bolt	upright. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	raced	over	to	the	door	and	started	banging	on	it,	rattling	the	handle	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">shouting	at	the	top	of	her	voice,	but	there	was	no	answer.	They	were	in	a	remote</p>
<p class="calibre1">part	 of	 the	 hotel,	 way	 down	 a	 long	 corridor,	 far	 from	 the	 main	 living	 quarters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mila	 joined	 her,	 peering	 through	 the	 keyhole	 but	 all	 she	 could	 see	 was	 the	 far wall	 and	 a	 doorway	 to	 another	 room.	 Riley	 pushed	 her	 out	 the	 way	 to	 see	 for herself.	If	it	wasn’t	her	imagination,	there	was	a	thin	veil	of	smoke	beginning	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">form,	drifting	along	the	corridor,	just	under	the	ceiling.	She	banged	harder	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>door.	In	the	room	above,	they	heard	footsteps	and	something	heavy	falling	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mila	unfastened	the	latch	on	the	sash	window	and	tried	to	heave	it	open	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">noticed	security	bolts	held	it	locked	in	place.	Their	only	option	was	to	smash	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">glass.	Meanwhile,	Adele	beat	out	a	rhythm	at	the	door.	She	said	the	smoke	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hallway	 was	 hanging	 heavier	 from	 the	 ceiling,	 slowly	 filling	 all	 skylights, apertures	 and	 recesses	 moving	 towards	 them	 down	 the	 corridor.	 The	 smell	 of burning	wood	and	plastic	reached	them	for	the	first	time.	Someone	was	ringing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 bell	 again,	 more	 insistent,	 this	 time	 more	 distant.	 Had	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 hotel residents	forgotten	all	about	them? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	picked	up	a	plastic	chair	and	tested	its	weight.	“Stand	back,	I’m	going</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 break	 the	 glass.”	 She	 had	 a	 practice	 swing	 and	 then	 threw	 the	 chair	 with	 all her	might	towards	the	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	chair	legs	folded	inwards,	coming	off	second	best	in	the	collision</p>
<p class="calibre1">against	 the	 frame	 of	 the	 original	 sash	 window.	 It	 bounced	 back	 harmlessly without	 making	 any	 impact	 on	 the	 glass	 itself.	 She	 tried	 again,	 this	 time	 with Mila’s	 help.	 Instead	 of	 throwing	 it,	 they	 used	 the	 chair	 leg	 as	 a	 battering	 ram. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 the	 first	 attempt,	 the	 glass	 cracked	 diagonally,	 but	 did	 not	 break.	 Their second	 effort	 shattered	 the	 glass	 into	 a	 dozen	 pieces	 and	 the	 lower	 half	 of	 the pane	 broke	 on	 to	 the	 thick	 pile	 of	 the	 carpet	 and	 flowerbed	 outside.	 They knocked	out	the	remaining	pieces	and	laid	a	blanket	over	the	frame	to	cover	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">remaining	 shards.	 They	 lifted	 Adele	 through	 the	 empty	 window,	 still	 groggy from	sleep,	passing	her	with	some	difficulty	to	Riley	standing	on	the	other	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 the	 extra	 weight	 of	 her	 load	 Riley's	 feet	 sank	 deep	 into	 the	 earth,	 as	 the pointed	thorns	of	a	rose	bush	scratched	at	her	arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 cool	 night	 air,	 it	 was	 strangely	 quiet	 on	 this	 far	 side	 of	 the	 building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	light	was	eerily	bright	and	strangely	incongruous.	An	orange	glow	lit	up	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sky	 that	 reminded	 Riley	 of	 the	 fifth	 of	 November,	 fireworks	 night.	 She	 half expected	 to	 find	 a	 towering	 bonfire,	 explosions	 in	 a	 million	 colours	 and shimmering	sparkles	raining	down	above	their	heads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	grabbed	Adele’s	hand	and	together	they	raced	round	to	the	other	side	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	building	to	find	a	hive	of	activity.	Smoke	was	pouring	from	two	of	the	upper</p>
<p class="calibre1">windows	on	the	second	floor,	curling	into	the	night	sky.	Fire	had	broken	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 roof	 in	 one	 section	 further	 down.	 Twenty	 women	 passed	 bucketload	 after bucketload	of	water	hand	over	hand	down	a	human	chain.	Each	bucket	was	sent</p>
<p class="calibre1">slopping	towards	the	French	doors	that	led	towards	the	lobby	area	and	staircase</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	upper	floors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 a	 shudder,	 Riley	 remembered	 Zed.	 He	 was	 likely	 still	 in	 the	 infirmary on	 the	 second	 floor.	 In	 his	 weakened	 state,	 he	 couldn’t	 possibly	 get	 out	 on	 his own.	 As	 she	 hurried	 inside	 heading	 towards	 the	 staircase,	 Sister	 Georgina	 held</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>her	hand	up	to	stop	her.	“It’s	too	dangerous.	No	one’s	allowed	up	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sister	was	right.	From	Riley’s	brief	stint	as	the	volunteer	fire	marshal	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 physiotherapy	 centre	 for	 veterans,	 rule	 one	 was	 to	 get	 everyone	 out	 safely and	wait	for	the	fire	brigade.	The	only	problem	was	no	one	was	coming	to	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Either	she	went	in	herself	or	Zed	would	die.	She	made	up	her	mind.	She	had	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">reach	him.	It	was	up	to	Riley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Try	 and	 stop	 me,”	 she	 said,	 pushing	 past.	 The	 sister	 lunged	 for	 Riley’s sleeve	but	it	was	too	late.	Riley	took	the	stairs	two	at	a	time.	She	passed	a	gaggle of	women	coming	back	down,	their	buckets	empty,	ready	to	be	refilled	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ornamental	ponds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 the	 first-floor	 landing,	 the	 line	 of	 women	 bent	 right	 towards	 the	 crackle and	roar	of	the	fire.	She	could	hear	raised	voices	shouting	instructions,	a	note	of panic	as	they	fought	to	regain	control.	Riley	shielded	her	face	against	the	stifling heat.	She	could	see	flames	not	twenty	metres	away	down	the	corridor	in	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 bedrooms	 on	 the	 first	 floor.	 The	 infirmary	 was	 on	 the	 next	 floor	 up.	 The stairs	 were	 deserted	 and	 dark.	 She	 knew	 she	 had	 to	 be	 quick.	 The	 flames	 had already	broken	through	between	floors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	halfway	up	the	next	staircase	when	she	stopped	dead,	overcome	by	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">powerful	sense	of	déjà	vu.	Instinct	told	her	what	she	needed	to	do.	Diving	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	of	the	bathrooms	she	grabbed	a	bath	towel,	soaked	it	in	a	bowl	of	grey	water</p>
<p class="calibre1">left	out	for	washing	hands.	Wrapping	the	towel	around	her	head	and	shoulders, </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 poured	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 bowl	 over	 her,	 soaking	 her	 clothes	 to	 give	 her	 some protection	against	the	heat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowing	her	pace,	she	tested	her	weight	on	each	of	the	steps,	unsure	of	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">lay	 ahead.	 There	 was	 a	 heavy	 fire	 door	 that	 gave	 access	 towards	 the	 infirmary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside,	it	was	suspiciously	quiet.	There	was	no	sign	of	flames,	but	thick	smoke</p>
<p class="calibre1">hung	 heavy	 from	 the	 ceiling	 all	 the	 way	 down	 to	 waist	 height.	 There	 was	 an impenetrable	wall	of	heat	and	cloying	fumes.	She	could	feel	the	smoke	catch	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	throat,	as	she	struggled	to	breathe.	The	cool	towel	wrapped	around	her	head</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 already	 steaming.	 She	 hesitated,	 painfully	 aware	 of	 the	 danger	 if	 she continued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 remembered	 her	 fire	 marshal	 training	 and	 got	 down	 on	 her	 hands	 and knees,	 staying	 low,	 just	 underneath	 the	 layer	 of	 smoke	 where	 the	 heat	 was	 less intense.	 She	 crawled	 along	 the	 carpet,	 clutching	 the	 damp	 towel	 to	 her	 mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 air	 was	 acrid	 and	 burned	 her	 throat.	 She	 started	 coughing,	 gulping	 air greedily	and	feeling	the	panic	begin	to	rise	in	her	throat.	She	felt	nauseous	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">retched	on	the	carpet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Focus,	 Riley,	 she	 told	 herself,	 you	 have	 to	 do	 this.	 She	 continued	 onwards, feeling	for	the	doorways	to	her	left.	The	first	door	was	locked,	the	second	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a>the	 nurse’s	 station	 but	 the	 room	 was	 empty.	 Perhaps	 the	 nurse	 had	 taken	 Zed with	her.	She	had	to	be	sure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Putting	 her	 weight	 against	 what	 she	 assumed	 was	 Zed’s	 door	 she	 levered	 it open	with	some	difficulty.	It	felt	as	if	she	was	fighting	against	an	invisible	force, pressure	sealed	against	the	smoke	and	heat.	Zed	was	beginning	to	stir,	oblivious</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 drama	 that	 was	 unfolding	 all	 around	 him.	 As	 the	 door	 began	 to	 close behind	her,	it	felt	like	all	the	air	was	being	sucked	from	the	room,	as	if	a	vacuum had	been	broken.	She	noticed	the	top	window	was	ajar.	The	fire	sucked	greedily</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	this	fresh	source	of	oxygen.	In	the	corridor,	she	heard	a	funnelling	of	air	as	the flames	leapt,	rejuvenated.	She	didn’t	have	much	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 shook	 Zed	 by	 the	 shoulders,	 whispering	 his	 name	 softly.	 His	 eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">flickered	 open,	 groggy	 and	 disoriented,	 then	 closed	 again.	 She	 tried	 again, shouting	 this	 time,	 an	 edge	 of	 panic	 creeping	 into	 her	 voice,	 “Zed,	 wake	 up, wake	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stirred,	his	eyes	wide,	blinking	at	her,	still	vacant	and	far	away.	The	nurse</p>
<p class="calibre1">must	 have	 given	 him	 something	 for	 the	 pain.	 She	 slapped	 him	 hard	 across	 the face,	shaking	him	by	the	shoulders.	She	raised	her	hand	to	strike	him	again	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	free	hand	grabbed	her	wrist	before	she	made	contact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	Riley.	I’m	awake.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	no	time	to	explain.	We	need	to	go	right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	got	gingerly	to	his	feet,	his	legs	weak	and	unbalanced.	She	supported	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">large	 frame,	 manoeuvring	 him	 towards	 the	 closed	 door.	 At	 first	 the	 door</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared	locked,	vacuum	sealed	by	the	difference	in	air	pressure,	but	she	hauled</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	open	with	all	her	might.	As	she	did	so	the	roar	of	flames	grew	suddenly	louder</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	from	the	far	end	of	the	corridor	came	a	surge	of	heat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 pushed	 Zed	 down	 to	 the	 ground	 and	 collapsed	 on	 top	 of	 him.	 An</p>
<p class="calibre1">explosion	 of	 heat	 and	 flame	 enveloped	 them	 and	 swept	 past	 them	 into	 the infirmary,	blasting	the	door	half	off	its	hinges.	Riley	could	taste	soot	and	burning hair	in	her	mouth	and	nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	pulled	Zed	on	to	his	hands	and	knees	and	they	started	crawling	side	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">side	 towards	 the	 stairwell.	 The	 smoke	 was	 cloying	 and	 darker	 now,	 only	 a	 few inches	from	the	carpet.	It	was	hopeless.	She	couldn’t	see	anything,	tears	rolling</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	 her	 cheeks.	 The	 heat	 behind	 them	 was	 intense.	 Zed’s	 whole	 body</p>
<p class="calibre1">convulsed	 with	 coughing	 but	 she	 encouraged	 him	 onwards,	 grabbing	 his	 good arm	and	half	hauling	him	a	few	more	inches	towards	safety. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 fire	 door	 stood	 resolute	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 corridor.	 A	 small	 rectangle	 of light	just	visible	through	the	smoke.	The	whole	space	was	now	completely	dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	only	by	feeling	her	way	along	the	wall	and	counting	the	doorways	that	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">realised	they	must	be	within	touching	distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a>Her	 breathing	 was	 coming	 in	 short	 rasps.	 Zed	 had	 collapsed	 beside	 her, unable	 to	 go	 further.	 It	 seemed	 to	 be	 growing	 hotter	 by	 the	 second.	 The	 carpet fibres	 were	 sticky	 to	 the	 touch	 from	 the	 heat	 below.	 The	 whole	 corridor	 had become	 a	 furnace.	 Unless	 they	 got	 moving	 again,	 it	 would	 soon	 become	 their tomb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	thrust	her	hand	out	one	last	time	and	touched	the	flat	painted	surface	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	fire	door,	its	paint	felt	like	it	was	beginning	to	blister.	Her	fingers	found	the edge	of	the	door	and	she	managed	to	prise	it	open,	forcing	it	outwards.	The	rush</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	cooler	air	was	delicious	and	intoxicating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 stood	 and	 fell	 outwards	 on	 to	 the	 landing,	 reaching	 back	 to	 pull	 Zed through.	They	both	lay	there	for	a	few	seconds	with	their	chests	heaving,	panting</p>
<p class="calibre1">hard,	trying	to	get	their	breath	back	before	a	darkness	enveloped	Riley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 was	 dimly	 aware	 of	 voices	 on	 the	 stairs.	 Hands	 helping	 them	 back	 up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	barely	conscious	as	they	supported	her	down	the	stairs.	Her	head	rolled</p>
<p class="calibre1">against	 a	 supporting	 shoulder	 as	 they	 half	 dragged	 her	 down	 towards	 ground-floor	 level.	 She	 was	 carried	 through	 a	 conservatory	 filled	 with	 pot	 plants	 and acres	 of	 glass	 and	 finally	 outside	 to	 be	 lowered	 gently	 on	 to	 the	 grass.	 It	 felt deliriously	 cool	 and	 moist	 on	 the	 back	 of	 her	 bare	 arms,	 soothing	 the	 burning sensation	on	exposed	flesh	at	her	wrists	and	knees	through	ripped	jeans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	 of	 the	 last	 things	 Riley	 remembered	 was	 Adele	 hugging	 her	 tightly</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	 her	 neck.	 She	 lay	 there	 staring	 up	 into	 the	 night	 sky,	 watching	 clouds drifting	 lazily	 over	 their	 heads.	 She	 was	 a	 spent	 force,	 every	 last	 ounce	 of strength	gone.	The	flames	from	two	upper	windows	bathed	the	trees	and	grass	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	her	in	light,	casting	a	warming	orange	glow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 she	 drifted	 in	 and	 out	 of	 consciousness,	 the	 upstairs	 windows	 began	 to resemble	 demonic	 eyes	 flaring	 wildly.	 The	 flames	 licked	 the	 outside	 of	 the building,	 making	 the	 iron	 gutters	 and	 fixings	 glow	 and	 spark.	 Alongside	 her, Zed’s	body	lay	motionless,	as	one	of	the	women	pumped	his	chest	with	the	palm</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	her	hand,	trying	to	resuscitate	him.	Riley	grasped	his	hand,	squeezing	it	hard</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	then	passed	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Thirty-seven</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 dawn	 broke	 at	 the	 Chewton	 Glen	 hotel,	 the	 fire	 had	 burned	 itself	 out.	 The southern	 end	 of	 the	 main	 building	 was	 a	 scarred,	 smoking	 wreck,	 blackened timbers	 exposed	 to	 the	 pale	 light	 of	 the	 new	 day.	 Laid	 out	 on	 the	 lawn	 were	 a dozen	bodies	covered	in	blankets	and	sheets	or	whatever	they	could	find	to	hide</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	faces.	Most	of	the	victims	had	been	overcome	by	smoke,	as	they	waited	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	rescued,	trapped	in	upstairs	rooms	by	the	rampaging	flames. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	sat	consoling	Stella,	her	face	blackened,	hair	singed	in	places.	Judging</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 people’s	 reaction	 to	 Riley’s	 appearance,	 she	 concluded	 she	 must	 look	 as awful	 as	 she	 felt.	 Stella	 had	 her	 head	 in	 her	 hands,	 sobbing.	 So	 many	 of	 her friends	were	gone,	their	lives	extinguished.	It	seemed	so	wrong	that	they	should</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	survived	the	virus,	only	to	be	killed	by	something	innocuous	like	a	candle</p>
<p class="calibre1">left	 to	 burn.	 Sister	 Imelda	 said	 the	 candle	 might	 have	 fallen	 over,	 out	 of	 its saucer	 and	 on	 to	 a	 carpet	 or	 against	 a	 drape.	 In	 a	 few	 minutes,	 the	 whole bedroom	would	have	been	ablaze	and	then	from	there,	a	fire	uncontained	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	spread	rapidly	to	the	other	rooms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stella	looked	up,	tears	streaming	down	her	face.	Mila	sat	cross-legged	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">picnic	blanket,	hugging	Stella	tightly.	There	was	nothing	that	anyone	could	say</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	make	it	better,	so	she	said	nothing.	The	three	of	them	stared	back	at	the	hotel, as	it	smouldered	quietly,	the	fire’s	energy	spent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sister	Theodora	was	busying	herself	organising	others,	handing	round	cups	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">tea,	 cut-up	 fruit	 and	 blankets	 for	 those	 who	 had	 fought	 so	 hard	 throughout	 the night	to	save	the	hotel	and	rescue	the	trapped	women.	Mila	stroked	Adele’s	hair</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	 last	 time	 and	 kissed	 her	 gently	 on	 the	 forehead.	 She	 rose	 to	 go	 find	 the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	nurse	had	set	up	a	temporary	surgery	in	one	of	the	outbuildings	that	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">once	been	a	soft-play	gym	for	toddlers.	Its	padded	floors	were	bright	blues	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">reds	 that	 made	 for	 comfortable	 mattresses	 to	 treat	 the	 walking	 wounded	 and those	 more	 seriously	 injured	 by	 the	 fire.	 In	 the	 corner,	 on	 the	 far	 side,	 Riley found	 Zed	 wrapped	 in	 a	 blanket,	 clutching	 a	 steaming	 mug	 of	 milky	 tea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	had	cleaned	his	face,	but	around	his	eyes	and	ears	there	were	streaks	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">dirt	 and	 singed	 hair	 that	 reminded	 Riley	 of	 the	 7/7	 bombing	 victims	 on	 the London	Underground	all	those	years	ago.	There	was	a	look	of	terror	etched	on</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>his	face,	staring	blankly	with	unseeing	eyes.	He	was	alive,	but	had	needed	CPR</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	get	him	breathing	again,	overcome	by	fumes.	He	nodded	wearily	at	Riley	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">blinked	his	eyes	rapidly	as	she	approached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looking	good,	Zed.	You	just	can’t	stay	out	of	trouble.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 tried	 to	 sit	 up	 but	 the	 strain	 was	 too	 much	 and	 he	 slumped	 back.	 Mila helped	 him	 upright.	 She	 leaned	 him	 back	 against	 the	 bright	 red	 cushions	 that smelled	of	a	nursery.	The	disinfectant	did	a	poor	job	of	masking	a	heady	blend	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">nappies	and	rancid	milk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	are	the	others?”	asked	Zed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stella	got	out	early.	She	was	lucky.	Some	of	them	didn’t	make	it	out	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Six	died	in	their	sleep.	They	just	never	woke	up.	There	wasn’t	a	mark	on	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 shook	 her	 head,	 still	 trying	 to	 dispel	 the	 mental	 image	 of	 those	 women lying	dead	in	their	beds.	“If	I	was	going	to	die,	that’s	how	I’d	like	to	go.	In	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">bed,	dreaming	of	being	on	a	beach	somewhere	hot.”	Her	voice	trailed	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	need	to	get	out	of	this	place,”	said	Zed,	his	voice	croaky.	He	reached	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	glass	of	water,	clearing	his	throat	before	continuing.	“We	need	to	get	back	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hurst,	to	our	own	people.	We’ve	been	gone	too	long	already.	They’ll	be	worried</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	us.	What	if	they	sent	a	rescue	party	or	followed	our	trail	into	town?	They’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">go	straight	to	the	hospital.	We’ve	got	to	get	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	till	you’re	well	enough	to	move.	Remember	what	the	nurse	said,”	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	don’t	have	time	enough	to	wait	around	here,”	said	Zed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 we	 can’t	 just	 leave	 these	 people	 in	 their	 hour	 of	 need.	 Look	 around.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 extended	 her	 arm	 towards	 the	 twenty	 or	 so	 people	 stretched	 out	 around them.	 Some	 were	 fighting	 for	 breath	 from	 smoke	 inhalation,	 others	 were	 in agony	 from	 burns.	 The	 nurse	 was	 bustling	 between	 them,	 bathing	 limbs	 and foreheads	with	wet	towels.	“They	need	us.	We	can’t	just	ship	out	after	all	they’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">done	for	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	nothing	we	can	do	for	them.	They	brought	this	on	themselves.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?	 You	 can’t	 seriously	 be	 suggesting	 that	 none	 of	 this	 would	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened	if	men	had	been	around	to	save	the	day?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	twist	my	words,	Riley.	I’m	just	saying	that	what	comes	around	goes</p>
<p class="calibre1">around.	Let’s	not	forget	that	Joe	is	still	locked	up	in	the	stables.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	tell	me	you’re	joking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	 seen	 it	 before.	 Cosmic	 forces.	 Karma.	 Call	 it	 what	 you	 like.”	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">glanced	 up	 and	 raised	 his	 eyebrows.	 “What	 would	 the	 sisters	 say:	 ‘The	 Lord moves	in	mysterious	ways.’	I’m	just	saying	that	natural	forces	are	at	work	here, </p>
<p class="calibre1">rebalancing.  <i class="calibre4">Honi	soit	qui	mal	y	pense</i>	and	all	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	does	that	even	mean?”	asked	Mila,	puzzled. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a>“You	know,	the	Order	of	the	Garter.	Evil	comes	to	those	who	think	evil.	You must	have	heard	that	before,	right?	Jack’s	forever	banging	on	about	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope.	I	swear	you	make	this	stuff	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	just	means	that	life	has	a	funny	sort	of	way	of	getting	its	own	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whatever	 the	 sisters	 think	 or	 believe,	 no	 one	 deserves	 to	 die.	 Just	 because they	have	strong	views	about	men,	doesn’t	mean	they	deserved	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	saying	that	at	all.	Don’t	re-imagine	what	the	sisters	have	done	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 isn’t	 the	 fulfilment	 of	 some	 weird	 feminist	 crusade	 for	 female</p>
<p class="calibre1">empowerment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“People	are	entitled	to	create	a	new	community	based	on	different	values.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whatever	happened	to	sexual	equality	being	the	goal?	Whoever	said	that	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 happy	 and	 prosperous	 required	 that	 someone	 else,	 an	 entire	 sex,	 had	 to	 be subjugated?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	people	don’t	like	what	they’ve	done	here,	then	they	should	leave.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 mean,	 if	 men	 don’t	 like	 it,	 they	 should	 leave?	 Careful,	 Riley.	 You’re beginning	to	sound	like	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	 get	 me	 wrong.	 I	 don’t	 want	 to	 stay	 any	 more	 than	 you	 do.	 But	 you can’t	say	it’s	not	refreshing	to	see	the	boot	on	the	other	foot	for	a	change.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	just	goes	to	prove	that,	given	half	a	chance,	women	can	be	just	as	abusive</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	prejudiced	as	men.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 looked	 back	 mockingly.	 “Prejudiced	 maybe,	 but	 I	 wouldn’t	 say	 evil, </p>
<p class="calibre1">would	you?	It’s	not	like	we’re	depriving	you	of	basic	human	rights,	forcing	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	stay	indoors	and	never	show	your	face	in	public.	We're	not	saying	you	can’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">drive	a	car,	vote,	have	a	job,	or	any	of	the	other	stuff	that	women	were	routinely</p>
<p class="calibre1">denied	 in	 some	 countries.	 Women	 will	 always	 have	 more	 of	 a	 bias	 towards nurturing	than	men.	Call	it	oestrogen	trumping	testosterone	any	day	of	the	week. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	don’t	see	women	slaughtering	each	other	for	bragging	rights.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 I	 wouldn’t	 say	 locking	 a	 man	 up	 in	 a	 stable	 as	 part	 of	 some	 cult breeding	programme	is	very	progressive	either.	Would	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	see	Joe	complaining.	He’s	like	a	pig	in	mud,”	added	Riley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 surely	 you	 can’t	 defend	 what	 they’re	 doing	 here?	 This	 nightmarish</p>
<p class="calibre1">version	 of	 feminism	 is	 abhorrent.	 It’s	 like	 a	 social	 experiment	 gone	 wrong.	 It deserves	to	fail.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Adele	popped	her	head	around	the	doorway	and	spotted	the	three	of	them	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	corner.	She	skipped	over	and	sank	down	on	top	of	Riley,	wrapping	herself	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 blanket	 and	 snuggling	 down	 in	 its	 folds.	 Adele’s	 arrival	 defused	 the escalating	hostility	between	them.	Mila	shrugged	her	shoulders	watching	the	pair</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 them	 go	 at	 it.	 They	 could	 fight	 for	 hours,	 going	 back	 and	 forth	 like	 this, evenly	 matched,	 exploring	 idea	 and	 counter-idea.	 Mila	 couldn't	 see	 the	 point; </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a>both	of	them	were	so	stubborn,	they	were	never	going	to	change. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing	Adele,	Riley’s	whole	face	seemed	to	relax	into	a	smile.	“How’re	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">doing,	kiddo?	Making	yourself	useful?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	 Sister	 Mel	 made	 me	 make	 like	 a	 hundred	 flatbreads.”	 She	 wriggled</p>
<p class="calibre1">round	 to	 face	 Riley,	 her	 eyes	 wide,	 her	 expression	 mischievous.	 “Hey,	 guess what	I	just	heard?	Joe	and	the	other	men	have	escaped.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	sat	bolt	upright,	her	fatigue	suddenly	evaporated.	It	was	like	an	electric</p>
<p class="calibre1">shock	 had	 passed	 through	 her	 body.	 “Escaped	 where?”	 She	 grabbed	 Adele’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulders.	 “This	 is	 important,	 Adele.	 You	 need	 to	 tell	 me	 exactly	 what	 you heard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Adele	looked	puzzled	but	realised	this	was	not	just	another	game.	She	sighed</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 told	 her	 what	 she	 knew.	 “Just	 that	 when	 the	 guard	 went	 to	 check	 on	 them after	the	fire,	the	stables	were	empty,	the	doors	were	wide	open.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	and	Zed	looked	at	each	other	in	confusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	 would	 Joe	 escape	 when	 they	 promised	 to	 release	 him	 tomorrow?	 It</p>
<p class="calibre1">doesn’t	make	any	sense.	The	finger	of	suspicion	is	going	to	point	squarely	at	us,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">said	Zed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	can’t	have	gone	very	far.	All	the	cars	are	still	parked	outside,”	added</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mila. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 if	 it	 wasn’t	 one	 of	 us	 who	 let	 them	 out,	 then	 who	 the	 hell	 was	 it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">wondered	Zed	out	loud. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Thirty-eight</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	sun	burst	through	the	trees	on	the	far	side	of	the	wood,	Joe	and	the	others</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 already	 two	 miles	 away,	 putting	 as	 much	 distance	 between	 them	 and	 the hotel	as	they	could	before	the	alarm	was	raised.	They	were	fairly	certain	that	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sisters	wouldn’t	send	their	guards	after	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	had	wanted	to	stay	behind,	to	wait	for	his	friends.	It	seemed	pointless	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">escape.	He	only	had	another	day	before	Zed	was	well	enough	and	the	Hurst	team</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 go	 home.	 Seamus	 had	 insisted	 he	 came	 with	 them.	 He	 told	 Joe	 that	 he would	 get	 the	 blame.	 Perhaps	 Seamus	 simply	 didn’t	 trust	 Joe	 to	 keep	 quiet.	 In the	end	he	felt	he	had	no	choice	but	to	go	with	them.	He	would	bide	his	time	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">wait	for	an	opportunity	to	slip	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 small	 group	 stayed	 as	 far	 as	 they	 could	 from	 roads,	 crossing	 fields	 and following	 footpaths	 through	 turnstiles,	 along	 fences	 and	 hedgerows	 that	 grew wild	and	impassable	in	places.	The	dawn	chorus	of	crows	and	rooks	masked	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">noise	 they	 made	 as	 they	 hurried	 away.	 Speed	 was	 more	 important	 than	 stealth right	now.	Besides,	they	reckoned	there	was	no	one	around	to	hear	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	had	Jean	to	thank	for	their	escape.	She	was	a	mousey	little	thing,	small</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 her	 age,	 Joe	 reckoned	 no	 more	 than	 sixteen.	 She	 had	 the	 responsibility	 of bringing	 the	 men	 food	 and	 water	 twice	 a	 day.	 Joe	 had	 warmed	 to	 her	 almost immediately.	She	was	naive	and	impressionable,	sympathetic	to	their	plight.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	agreed	to	help	them	should	the	opportunity	arise.	All	they	had	needed	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">diversion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	had	been	Seamus	who	had	talked	her	into	helping.	He	was	always	going	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	the	injustice	of	their	captivity	and	how	the	right	thing	to	do	was	to	release them	 and	 help	 them	 escape.	 He	 had	 nurtured	 this	 idea	 almost	 daily	 for	 the	 last four	 months,	 or	 so	 he	 said,	 twisting	 the	 conversation,	 moulding	 her	 to	 his purpose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lying	 on	 his	 bed	 in	 the	 evenings,	 Joe	 had	 listened	 to	 Seamus	 whispering kindnesses	to	Jean,	engaging	her	in	conversation,	trying	to	build	her	trust,	gain</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 confidence,	 then	 bad-mouthing	 her	 as	 soon	 as	 she	 had	 left,	 his	 guile	 and artifice	laid	bare.	Joe	didn’t	like	Seamus’s	methods	but	figured	the	end	justified</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	means. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	 I	 ever	 tell	 you	 what	 I	 was	 doing	 before	 all	 this?”	 asked	 Seamus.	 Joe</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>realised	he	was	fond	of	the	sound	of	his	own	voice,	as	if	he	was	afraid	of	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	labouring	on	this	farm	just	north	of	New	Milton	with	these	Polish	lads.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	ever	intended	to	stay	in	England	for	the	summer	months	till	harvest	time.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	trying	to	earn	enough	money	to	travel.	Me	and	a	couple	of	mates	planned	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">spend	 the	 winter	 in	 Athens,	 doing	 bar	 work	 and	 sleeping	 above	 a	 fast-food restaurant	we	knew,	near	the	Acropolis.	But	I	never	made	it	out	of	England.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	happened?”	Joe	prompted,	keen	to	keep	him	talking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,	I	remember	like	it	was	yesterday.	I	woke	at	first	light	with	the	mother</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	all	hangovers.	They	took	the	money	and	my	car,	but	they	wouldn’t	have	got</p>
<p class="calibre1">far.	 That	 car	 was	 only	 held	 together	 with	 fibreglass.	 I	 rewelded	 that	 chassis	 so many	times	it	was	a	death	trap.	The	rest	of	the	farm	buildings	were	deserted.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">family	must	have	left	in	the	night.	I	stuck	around	for	a	couple	of	days	but	when	it was	 clear	 that	 no	 one	 was	 coming	 back	 I	 broke	 in	 to	 the	 farmhouse	 and	 lived there	on	my	own	until	the	food	ran	out.	After	that	I	suppose	I	began	a	nomadic</p>
<p class="calibre1">existence,	living	on	my	wits,	until	the	day	those	bitches	from	the	Chewton	Glen</p>
<p class="calibre1">captured	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jean	glared	back	at	Seamus	but	her	words	of	reproach	froze	on	her	lips,	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	every	other	time	he	criticised	the	sisters.	Joe	watched	their	silent	exchange. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	hated	the	way	Seamus	manipulated	her.	How	he	would	feign	interest	in	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">teenage	 life,	 commenting	 on	 the	 clothes	 she	 wore,	 how	 she	 wore	 her	 hair, ingratiating	himself	slowly	but	surely	into	her	favours.	Joe	had	to	admit	Seamus</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	a	good	listener.	Jean	would	hang	around	late	into	the	night	at	least	until	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">guard	told	her	to	leave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	end	Seamus	had	convinced	Jean	to	make	the	leap	from	sympathiser	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">collaborator.	 When	 the	 commotion	 of	 the	 fire	 distracted	 the	 guards	 and	 drew them	from	their	posts,	she	crept	back	to	the	stable	block.	She	stole	the	keys	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	hook,	released	the	men	from	their	captivity.	Together	they	ran	down	the	drive</p>
<p class="calibre1">towards	 open	 fields	 and	 freedom	 beyond.	 Jean	 had	 remembered	 to	 bring	 what little	 food	 she	 could	 conceal	 over	 the	 last	 few	 days.	 In	 Tupperware	 containers, she	kept	biscuits	and	leftover	rice,	already	desiccated	and	stale.	In	her	rucksack</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	had	a	metal	flask	for	water,	a	torch	and	a	pocketknife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	wasn’t	sure,	but	he	was	beginning	to	think	that	the	fire	was	no	accident. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps	Seamus	had	put	her	up	to	that	too.	He	had	to	admit,	it	was	fortuitous	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 purposes,	 to	 say	 the	 least.	 Judging	 by	 the	 smoke	 that	 rose	 high	 into	 the dawn	behind	them,	the	fire	had	been	devastating.	He	felt	terrible	leaving	Zed	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 rest	 of	 them	 behind.	 His	 best	 option	 was	 to	 wait	 for	 an	 opportunity	 to	 slip away.	 He	 felt	 a	 responsibility	 to	 Jean,	 despite	 what	 she	 may	 or	 may	 not	 have done.	Without	him	there,	he	feared	for	her	safety.	He	determined	to	take	her	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	him	to	Hurst. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>When	they	were	several	miles	from	the	hotel,	Seamus	held	up	his	hand	and they	 gathered	 round	 a	 lonely	 bench	 on	 a	 country	 lane	 where	 the	 landscape opened	out.	Views	stretched	across	fields	of	rapeseed,	swaying	bright	yellow	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	sunshine.	The	four	men	took	it	in	turns	to	drink	from	the	flask	of	water	Jean</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	brought.	They	shared	a	joke,	hands	on	hips,	wiping	sweat	from	their	brows, </p>
<p class="calibre1">before	finally	allowing	Jean	and	Joe	to	share	the	last	drops. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	 are	 we	 heading?”	 asked	 Joe,	 interrupting	 a	 private	 conversation</p>
<p class="calibre1">between	Seamus	and	one	of	the	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	 much	 further	 now.	 Maybe	 another	 mile.	 There’s	 a	 house	 not	 far	 from here,	 very	 secluded.	 Big	 place	 with	 an	 orchard	 and	 greenhouses,	 full	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">vegetables.	We	used	to	deliver	animal	feed	there.	Seems	like	a	lifetime	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	you	know	there	won’t	still	be	someone	there?”	challenged	Joe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seamus	spat	something	on	the	ground	and	kicked	the	earth	with	his	boot.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	up	with	a	smile,	squinting	in	to	the	sun.	“I	don’t,	but	I’ve	a	feeling	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	farmer’s	daughter	will	remember	me.	Either	that,	or	they’ll	be	long	gone	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">now.	It	was	a	couple	of	years	ago.	If	you’ve	got	a	better	idea,	I’m	all	ears.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 an	 edge	 to	 his	 voice	 that	 made	 Joe	 pause.	 It	 wasn’t	 worth	 an argument.	 After	 all,	 he	 had	 no	 intention	 of	 staying	 with	 the	 group.	 His	 instinct was	 screaming	 that	 prime	 sites	 like	 these	 were	 normally	 occupied.	 If	 they	 still had	stores	and	food,	then	they	would	not	welcome	the	arrival	of	strangers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	they	approached	 the	farm,	they	 stopped	at	the	 boundary	fence,	watching</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 house	 and	 outbuildings	 for	 any	 movement	 or	 other	 signs	 of	 recent</p>
<p class="calibre1">occupation.	Seamus	told	the	others	to	stay	hidden	while	he	scouted	ahead.	After</p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty	 minutes,	 lying	 on	 a	 grassy	 bank	 under	 a	 sycamore	 tree,	 basking	 in	 the mid-morning	 sunshine,	 they	 heard	 footsteps	 approaching	 down	 the	 lane	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">readied	 themselves.	 Joe	 grabbed	 a	 small	 log,	 holding	 it	 high	 above	 his	 head, ready	to	strike.	The	others	shifted	uneasily	from	one	foot	to	the	other,	waiting	to grab	 whoever	 emerged	 from	 around	 the	 corner.	 They	 all	 breathed	 a	 collective sigh	of	relief	as	Seamus	whistled	a	prearranged	greeting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walking	 up	 the	 rough	 track	 that	 led	 to	 the	 farm,	 there	 were	 no	 signs	 of vehicles.	A	tree	had	fallen	right	across	the	track,	blocking	the	road.	They	passed</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	sign	for	a	local	construction	firm	and	immediately	understood	why.	The	whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">place	 was	 mid-renovation.	 Scaffolding	 framed	 the	 far	 end	 of	 the	 farmhouse, where	 the	 original	 red	 brick	 building	 was	 being	 extended.	 A	 large	 modern kitchen	with	a	conservatory,	patio	area	and	stone	steps	led	down	to	a	landscaped</p>
<p class="calibre1">slope	thinly	covered	with	what	looked	like	newly	sewn	grass,	stretching	towards</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	stream	that	ran	through	the	back	of	the	property. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	took	a	minute	to	refill	the	flask	in	the	lazy	flow	of	the	cool	water,	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">cautiously	 approaching	 the	 front	 porch.	 There	 was	 a	 beaten-up	 old	 estate	 car</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a>parked	outside	with	three	flat	tyres. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seamus	 tried	 the	 handle,	 but	 found	 the	 oak	 panelled	 door	 locked.	 Its	 white paint	 had	 peeled	 away,	 revealing	 knotted	 wood	 and	 sturdy	 iron	 hinges.	 He kicked	at	the	door	a	couple	of	times,	grunting	as	he	came	off	worse	for	wear.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">others	 watched	 him,	 arms	 crossed,	 faintly	 amused	 by	 his	 bravado.	 The	 hinges and	 lock	 refused	 to	 budge.	 Seamus	 directed	 the	 group	 to	 split	 up	 and	 head	 in opposite	directions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	and	Jean	set	off	together,	testing	each	of	the	shutters	and	windows	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ground-floor	 windows	 but	 found	 them	 each	 securely	 fastened.	 Jean	 froze, </p>
<p class="calibre1">hearing	 footsteps	 coming	 around	 the	 house	 towards	 them.	 They	 pressed</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves	 against	 the	 wall	 and	 crouched	 down	 only	 to	 see	 Seamus	 and	 the others	 rounding	 the	 corner,	 completing	 their	 search.	 The	 extension	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">conservatory	proved	more	rewarding.	They	found	an	empty	window	frame	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	glass.	Seamus	punched	one	of	the	other	men	on	the	shoulder,	laughing	at	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	fortune. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside	was	a	half-finished	kitchen	stacked	with	pallets	of	floor	tiles	and	flat-</p>
<p class="calibre1">packed	 furniture,	 including	 various	 tools	 left	 out	 at	 the	 end	 of	 a	 shift.	 Seamus smashed	a	small	pane	of	semi-opaque	glass	with	his	elbow	and	reached	through, </p>
<p class="calibre1">groping	 for	 the	 catch.	 He	 found	 the	 key	 still	 in	 the	 lock.	 Seamus	 paused	 as	 he and	Joe	had	the	same	thought.	If	the	house	was	all	locked	up	from	the	inside,	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	mean	someone	was	still	living	here?	Seamus	raised	his	finger	to	his	lips	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	 sure	 everyone	 had	 understood	 his	 instruction	 before	 continuing	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">search. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	squeaked	in	protest	as	he	wrenched	it	open,	stepping	into	the	cool</p>
<p class="calibre1">darkness	beyond.	The	main	reception	room	looked	untouched,	dust	layered	grey</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	every	surface.	There	were	no	signs	of	disturbance.	A	vase	in	the	middle	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">long	mahogany	table	held	what	remained	of	wilted	flowers,	the	water	brown	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">mouldy	 in	 its	 base.	 There	 was	 a	 musty	 smell	 about	 the	 place.	 Disturbed	 dust drifted	 in	 shafts	 of	 sunlight	 that	 penetrated	 through	 gaps	 in	 the	 shutters.	 It	 was like	stepping	into	a	tomb,	frozen	in	time,	untouched	by	human	hand	for	months, </p>
<p class="calibre1">maybe	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next	 door,	 there	 was	 a	 snug-room	 with	 whitewashed	 walls	 and	 a	 large</p>
<p class="calibre1">fireplace,	 its	 grate	 covered	 in	 grey	 ash,	 from	 a	 fire	 long	 since	 cold.	 Either	 side there	were	bookshelves	set	deep	into	the	wall.	Behind	the	door,	Joe	could	see	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">high-sided	 armchair	 facing	 an	 old-fashioned	 television	 set.	 Joe	 had	 not	 seen	 a TV	 like	 this	 since	 his	 childhood	 staying	 at	 his	 grandparents’	 house	 up	 near Scarborough,	 in	 north	 Yorkshire.	 Televisions	 with	 cathode-ray	 tubes	 predated plasma	and	flat-screen	technologies	by	some	twenty	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 sixth	 sense	 made	 the	 hairs	 on	 Joe’s	 neck	 prickle.	 Was	 his	 mind	 playing</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>tricks	 or	 was	 there	 someone	 sitting	 in	 the	 chair?	 He	 signalled	 to	 the	 others behind	 him	 and	 leaned	 his	 head	 further	 around	 the	 door.	 His	 instincts	 proved right.	 He	 could	 see	 a	 pair	 of	 shoes	 resting	 on	 a	 footstool.	 He	 readied	 himself, gulping	air.	He	picked	up	a	glass	paperweight	from	the	side	table	and	advanced</p>
<p class="calibre1">further	into	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slumped	 in	 the	 armchair	 was	 an	 emaciated	 old	 man.	 His	 eyes	 were	 open, </p>
<p class="calibre1">staring	 lifelessly	 at	 the	 TV,	 his	 mouth	 wide,	 with	 prune-like	 skin	 drawn	 tight across	his	jaw,	discoloured	and	ravaged	by	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	 had	 gotten	 used	 to	 seeing	 death	 at	 close	 quarters.	 It	 no	 longer	 bothered him.	 In	 fact	 he	 had	 developed	 a	 whole	 vocabulary	 around	 death	 that	 helped	 to dehumanise	the	victims.	Jack	had	once	told	him	it	was	a	coping	strategy	and	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	 one	 ever	 got	 used	 to	 seeing	 dead	 people.	 They	 just	 found	 a	 way	 of	 dealing with	it	so	it	no	longer	held	the	power	to	shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	 leaned	 in	 closer,	 inspecting	 the	 corpse.	 There	 was	 no	 sign	 of	 illness,	 no flecking	in	the	eyes,	no	dried	blood	around	the	nose	or	ears.	This	man	had	died</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 old	 age,	 plain	 and	 simple.	 He	 had	 simply	 sat	 there	 and	 waited	 to	 die,	 an empty	 mug	 perched	 on	 a	 nested	 table	 beside	 him.	 Perhaps	 the	 old	 man	 had nowhere	 else	 to	 go,	 watching	 the	 news	 broadcasts	 until	 they	 went	 off	 air, replaced	by	the	pre-recorded	public	service	announcements	that	told	everyone	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">stay	indoors,	avoid	contact	with	others	and	wait	for	further	instructions.	He	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">died	alone,	on	his	own	terms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	seemed	to	Joe	a	better	way	to	go	than	the	panic	and	disorder	in	the	cities, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	chaos	at	the	hospitals	and	treatment	centres	overrun	with	the	sick.	In	the	end</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	hospitals	had	simply	locked	their	doors	and	turned	new	arrivals	away.	Fearful</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 further	 contamination,	 poorly	 resourced	 to	 deal	 with	 the	 flood	 of	 humanity, they	were	unable	to	do	anything	but	reserve	them	floor	space	to	curl	up	and	die. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	jolted	back	to	the	present	by	a	scream.	Jean	hid	her	face	against	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulder,	 shielding	 her	 eyes	 with	 her	 hands.	 She	 looked	 through	 clenched</p>
<p class="calibre1">fingers,	 a	 morbid	 fascination	 beginning	 to	 replace	 the	 initial	 horror.	 “That’s disgusting,”	she	said,	unable	to	look	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	evidence	of	infection.	This	one	died	of	old	age.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seamus	gave	the	body	a	cursory	look	before	turning	his	back.	“The	rest	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">place	is	deserted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	 was	 still	 staring	 at	 the	 old	 man’s	 face,	 studying	 his	 features.	 There	 was something	 about	 him	 that	 looked	 familiar.	 He	 clicked	 his	 fingers,	 pleased	 with himself	as	the	penny	finally	dropped.	“David	Jason.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jean	looked	up	at	him	confused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know.	Don’t	you	think	he	looks	a	bit	like	David	Jason?”	Jean	was	none</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	wiser.	“You	remember?	The	actor?	Played	Del	Boy	off	that	BBC	sitcom	 <i class="calibre4">Only</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a> <i class="calibre4">Fools	and	Horses</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jean	looked	again	but	shook	her	head.	She	had	never	heard	of	 <i class="calibre4">Only	Fools	and</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Horses</i>	though	she	liked	the	name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Suppose	 you	 never	 had	 just	 the	 four	 broadcast	 channels	 to	 choose	 from. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your	generation	was	all	reality	TV	and	box	sets,	YouTube	and	watching	stuff	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	 phone.”	 Joe	 sighed,	 nostalgic	 for	 a	 forgotten	 time	 when	 families	 would watch	 live	 broadcasts	 together	 on	 a	 Saturday	 evening.  <i class="calibre4">Doctor	 Who</i>,  <i class="calibre4">X	 Factor</i>, <i class="calibre4">Strictly</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	talk	funny.”	Jean	frowned,	pushing	past	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seamus’s	 voice	 from	 the	 wood-panelled	 corridor	 outside	 interrupted	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">exchange.	 “Jean,	 go	 make	 yourself	 useful	 and	 get	 a	 fire	 lit.	 There’s	 a	 whole larder	full	of	cans	and	pasta	in	there.	We’ve	hit	gold,”	he	said,	clapping	his	hands together	in	delight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	a	sigh,	Jean	mumbled	something	under	her	breath	and	dutifully	headed</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	to	grab	logs	from	the	stack	of	chopped	wood	in	the	garage,	together	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">firelighters	and	matches	Joe	had	found	above	the	fireplace	in	the	snug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Together	 the	 men	 carried	 the	 old	 man’s	 body	 outside	 and	 dumped	 his	 frail desiccated	 corpse	 head	 first	 in	 a	 large	 green	 recycling	 bin.	 Joe	 rushed	 out	 to remonstrate	with	the	men,	berating	them	for	their	lack	of	respect,	insisting	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">bury	him	properly.	The	other	men	looked	at	each	other	and	walked	off,	laughing</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	Joe’s	protestations.	“If	that’s	what	you	want,	then	you	do	it,”	said	the	larger	of the	two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	rummaged	in	 the	shed	amongst	 an	assortment	of	 gardening	tools	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 found	 what	 he	 was	 looking	 for.	 He	 grabbed	 a	 shovel	 and	 started	 digging	 a shallow	 grave	 under	 an	 olive	 tree.	 Considering	 they	 were	 taking	 the	 old	 man’s house	and	eating	his	food,	it	was	a	small	sign	of	respect,	but	an	important	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	hoped	that	others	would	do	the	same	for	him	when	the	time	came. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 hard	 work	 and	 within	 minutes	 his	 clothes	 were	 soaked	 in	 sweat.	 The resulting	hole	was	only	a	few	inches,	but	deep	enough	for	its	purpose.	When	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">stood	back,	leaning	on	the	shovel,	a	half-smile	formed	on	his	lips.	He	felt	a	glow</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	respectability. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 sat	 in	 silence	 over	 dinner,	 sharing	 cans	 of	 baked	 beans	 and	 chicken curry	that	Jean	had	heated	up	for	them	over	a	fire.	They	washed	it	down	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">full	bottle	of	sherry,	the	first	proper	drink	the	men	had	had	in	many	months.	By</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	of	dessert,	they	passed	round	a	half-full	bottle	of	Baileys,	listening	to	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 Seamus’s	 stories	 of	 growing	 up	 in	 Ireland	 and	 tall	 tales	 of	 personal	 triumph and	good	fortune.	Joe	was	sick	of	hearing	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seamus	 yawned	 and	 stretched:	 “Think	 I’ll	 turn	 in.	 I’ll	 take	 the	 master</p>
<p class="calibre1">bedroom,	the	rest	of	you	can	fight	over	the	rest.	I	found	this	place,	didn’t	I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>No	 one	 argued.	 He	 grabbed	 Jean’s	 wrist	 and	 hauled	 her	 up	 forcefully.	 She looked	confused	and	tried	to	snatch	back	her	arm,	but	he	held	tight.	“Come	on, </p>
<p class="calibre1">let’s	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 pulled	 away	 from	 him,	 her	 hand	 slipping	 from	 his	 moist	 palms.	 “What are	you	doing?”	said	Jean. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	moment,	she	looked	like	a	defenceless	animal,	caught	in	the	headlights, </p>
<p class="calibre1">painfully	unaware	of	the	danger	right	in	front	of	her,	but	paralysed	and	unable	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">move.	 She	 looked	 at	 the	 others	 imploring	 for	 their	 help,	 but	 they	 seemed complicit	in	whatever	was	happening	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seamus	 smiled	 a	 lascivious	 smile,	 his	 movements	 were	 slow	 and	 imprecise</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 the	 booze.	 Hunched	 over	 in	 the	 semi-darkness,	 the	 man	 on	 the	 crate grinned	 back,	 enjoying	 the	 drama.	 His	 teeth	 were	 a	 dull	 yellow,	 several	 were missing.	He	took	another	long	swig	from	the	bottle,	never	taking	his	eyes	off	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">girl.	Seamus	turned	back	to	face	Jean.	His	smile	was	gone.	“Let’s	go,	I	said.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 tone	 towards	 her	 was	 different,	 more	 insistent	 somehow.	 Gone	 was	 the charming,	 affable	 Seamus	 who	 looked	 out	 for	 Jean,	 cared	 for	 her,	 the	 man	 she probably	had	a	secret	crush	on.	The	person	standing	in	front	of	her	wanted	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing	only.	Wide-eyed,	she	suddenly	saw	him	properly	for	the	first	time	and	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	 afraid.	 How	 could	 she	 have	 been	 so	 blind,	 thought	 Joe?	 He	 looked	 like	 a predator	circling	his	prey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 backed	 towards	 the	 door,	 her	 eyes	 darting	 between	 Joe	 and	 Seamus, </p>
<p class="calibre1">panic	building.	She	still	had	time	to	run	if	she	was	quick.	She	tried	to	stall.	“I’m not	tired.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Neither	am	I.”	Seamus	shook	his	head,	emboldened	by	the	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	started	to	intervene:	“Listen,	Seamus,	I	don’t	think…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seamus	whipped	his	head	round	and	silenced	him	before	he	could	finish.	“I</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t	give	a	monkey’s	what	you	think.	Stay	out	of	this,	fat	boy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jean	 suddenly	 grasped	 what	 was	 happening	 and	 started	 to	 cry.	 “Please,	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t…I	don’t	want	to.	Joe,	please,	don’t	let	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	 rose	 quickly	 and	 stood	 between	 them,	 blocking	 his	 path.	 He	 raised	 his hands	in	front	of	him	to	try	to	defuse	the	situation,	appealing	for	Seamus	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">sensible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seamus	 shook	 his	 head.	 “Don’t	 be	 a	 mug.	 We	 all	 know	 what’s	 going	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">happen	here.	Don’t	try	and	get	in	my	way.	I’m	warning	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	has	gone	far	enough.	If	you	do	anything	to	that	girl	you’ll	have	me	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">answer	for,”	cautioned	Joe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 thought	 you	 were	 one	 of	 us.”	 Seamus	 looked	 around	 the	 others,	 making eye	contact	with	each	of	them.	“Such	a	disappointment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	nothing	like	you,	Seamus.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a>“Locking	 us	 up	 in	 that	 place,	 for	 all	 that	 time,	 they	 treated	 us	 like	 animals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sure,	you	were	only	there	a	few	days,	but	us,	we	were	there	for	weeks	on	end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	has	to	pay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doesn’t	mean	we	have	to	behave	like	animals.	We’re	better	than	that,	aren’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">we?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 may	 be,	 Joe,	 but	 I’m	 not.	 Treat	 me	 like	 an	 animal	 and	 sooner	 or	 later that’s	what	I	become.	I’ve	been	waiting	for	this	day	for	a	long	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jean’s	chest	was	heaving	as	her	terror	mounted,	adrenaline	pumping	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	veins,	her	fists	clenched.	She	made	a	break	for	the	open	doorway,	but	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	men	grabbed	her	wrist	and	pushed	her	back	into	the	middle	of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seamus	nodded	at	his	former	cellmate.	Joe	never	heard	or	saw	it	coming,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	only	vaguely	conscious	of	movement	behind	him	and	a	severe	blow	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	of	his	head.	He	collapsed	on	to	the	floor	and	the	world	went	dark.	He	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">dimly	 aware	 of	 voices	 and	 snatched	 fragments	 of	 conversations.	 A	 strangled scream,	hurried	footsteps	going	up	the	stairs,	then	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 he	 woke,	 it	 was	 dark	 with	 only	 the	 flickering	 light	 of	 a	 candle	 in	 a saucer.	His	hands	and	feet	were	tied	with	what	felt	like	bungee	cord,	lying	on	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cold	limestone	floor.	Jean	and	the	others	were	nowhere	to	be	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Thirty-nine</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	squinted	up	into	the	beam	of	sunlight	that	struck	the	paving	stone	next	to	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">head.	 A	 dirty	 J-cloth	 had	 been	 stuffed	 in	 his	 mouth	 to	 stop	 him	 shouting	 out, which	made	breathing	difficult.	There	was	a	metallic	taste	to	the	cloth	as	if	it	had once	been	used	to	clean	paint	brushes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	been	down	here	for	two	days	now	in	a	state	of	squalor	that	made	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">gag	 each	 time	 he	 woke.	 His	 underwear	 was	 heavily	 soiled	 and	 despite	 his	 best efforts	to	wriggle	clear	of	the	wet	patch	on	the	floor,	he	had	been	unable	to	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	 real	 sleep	 for	 the	 last	 few	 hours.	 He	 was	 dangerously	 dehydrated	 and exhausted.	 Conserving	 his	 remaining	 energy,	 he	 listened	 helplessly	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shouting	and	intermittent	screams	from	above.	In	part	as	a	subconscious	defence</p>
<p class="calibre1">mechanism,	his	thoughts	were	miles	away.	He	had	been	filling	the	interminable</p>
<p class="calibre1">hours	 reflecting	 on	 a	 happier	 time	 before	 the	 outbreak,	 escaping	 from	 the hopelessness	 of	 his	 current	 predicament.	 The	 smell	 of	 paint	 and	 the	 unpleasant taste	in	his	mouth	somehow	reminded	him	of	his	old	neighbour	Howard	and	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">part-time	 work	 for	 a	 decorating	 business	 run	 by	 a	 friend.	 Paint	 brushes	 left	 to soak	 in	 white	 spirit	 on	 his	 windowsill	 overnight.	 How	 he	 wished	 his	 best	 mate was	here	with	him	right	now.	He	could	have	done	with	the	company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	 coming	 to	 Hurst,	 Joe	 had	 spent	 several	 months	 holed	 up	 in	 a	 tower block	 in	 Shirley,	 on	 the	 outskirts	 of	 Southampton.	 The	 two	 friends	 shared	 a passion	for	bad	sci-fi,	Southampton	football	club,	Britpop	and	video	games	–	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	gore	and	violence	the	better.	They	took	it	in	turns	to	car	share	into	town	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 same	 multi-story	 car	 park	 down	 near	 the	 docks.	 Howard	 was	 a	 crane</p>
<p class="calibre1">operator,	responsible	for	unloading	large	shipping	containers	on	tight	schedules</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 rewarded	 for	 hitting	 daily	 targets.	 It	 was	 dull	 work,	 but	 paid	 well	 and	 it meant	he	got	to	spend	the	day	listening	to	music	or	daydreaming,	with	a	window</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	commercial	world	overlooking	the	port.	By	comparison,	Joe’s	days	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	mundane,	working	in	the	kiosk	at	the	local	cinema	in	Ocean	Village.	After</p>
<p class="calibre1">work,	 they	 would	 sneak	 in	 and	 catch	 the	 latest	 releases,	 enjoying	 unlimited refills	of	Coke	and	popcorn	till	their	bellies	were	full,	belching	on	the	front	row in	the	darkness,	laughing	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 the	 first	 news	 reports	 of	 isolated	 outbreaks	 of	 the	 virus	 began	 in earnest,	 people	 left	 the	 cities	 in	 their	 droves,	 carrying	 what	 they	 could.	 Those</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>that	 remained	 took	 full	 advantage	 of	 unprotected	 stores	 and	 shopping	 centres. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 the	 numbers	 of	 rioters	 swelled,	 sweeping	 away	 the	 thin	 blue	 line	 of	 law and	order,	large	segments	of	the	urban	population	formed	ant-trails	to	electronics</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 clothing	 stores	 for	 the	 latest	 gear.	 They	 had	 staggered	 home	 happy	 with wide-screen	 televisions	 and	 DVD	 players,	 unaware	 that	 the	 days	 of	 widely</p>
<p class="calibre1">available	 electricity	 were	 soon	 coming	 to	 an	 end.	 Blackouts	 swiftly	 ensued, leaving	displays	lifeless	and	obsolete. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	had	the	foresight	to	borrow	a	Transit	van	from	his	downstairs	neighbour, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	drove	to	the	local	cash	and	carry	a	few	blocks	away.	They	had	avoided	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">supermarkets.	By	then	larger	stores	were	surrounded	by	private	security	guards</p>
<p class="calibre1">equipped	with	riot	shields	and	batons	to	deter	the	hungry	crowds.	With	Howard’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">help,	 Joe	 loaded	 up	 on	 multipacks	 of	 fruit	 juice	 and	 mineral	 water,	 boxes	 of biscuits,	 nuts	 and	 crisps,	 dried	 fruit	 and	 Biltong,	 sacks	 of	 rice	 and	 pasta,	 and anything	else	that	would	last	without	refrigeration.	By	the	time	they	were	done, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they	had	ferried	seventeen	brim-full	shopping	trolleys	to	the	van	parked	in	a	side</p>
<p class="calibre1">alley.	 It	 took	 them	 the	 best	 part	 of	 a	 day	 to	 manhandle	 box	 after	 box	 up	 the eleven	 flights	 of	 stairs	 to	 their	 bedsits,	 the	 lift	 broken	 for	 the	 third	 time	 that month.	It	was	a	small	block	and	they	shared	the	floor	with	two	larger	flats,	both</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	whose	occupants	were	away	on	holiday	or	business,	they	weren’t	sure	which. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 remembered	 the	 day	 a	 convoy	 of	 army	 trucks	 arrived	 to	 reinforce	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">police.	Hundreds	of	soldiers	did	their	best	to	wrestle	back	control	with	tear	gas</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	rubber	bullets,	before	they	were	overwhelmed	and	forced	to	retreat,	leaving</p>
<p class="calibre1">gangs	 of	 youths	 to	 slaughter	 each	 other	 in	 a	 mad	 scramble	 for	 what	 little	 food and	water	remained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	 and	 Howard,	 along	 with	 a	 family	 from	 downstairs,	 watched	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">increasing	alarm.	They	decided	to	take	matters	into	their	own	hands,	barricading</p>
<p class="calibre1">shut	 the	 ground-floor	 stairwell	 door	 with	 two	 sofas	 and	 a	 kitchen	 table	 hurled from	 the	 floor	 above.	 They	 reinforced	 the	 metal	 doors	 with	 two	 heavy-looking curtain	 rods,	 top	 and	 bottom.	 It	 would	 keep	 the	 more	 curious	 scavengers	 away but	 they	 both	 knew	 it	 was	 unlikely	 to	 stop	 any	 concerted	 effort.	 If	 the	 gangs thought	there	was	anything	of	value	inside,	they	would	find	a	way.	It	was	just	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter	of	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	family	downstairs	got	sick	first.	There	was	nothing	Joe	or	Howard	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	for	them.	Through	the	air	vents,	they	heard	the	children	coughing	through	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">night.	 The	 next	 day	 when	 they	 went	 to	 check	 on	 them,	 there	 was	 no	 response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	was	silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	a	smile,	Joe	remembered	spending	their	days	reading	fiction,	sometimes</p>
<p class="calibre1">aloud.	Howard	thought	it	was	important	to	stay	fit,	so	they	took	it	in	turns	to	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">press-ups	 and	 sit-ups,	 running	 relays	 up	 and	 down	 the	 stairs.	 Hours	 passed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>slowly,	lost	in	conversation,	arguing	about	the	most	pointless	stuff,	like	you	did when	you	no	longer	had	TV,	work	or	social	media	to	occupy	your	every	waking</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought.	Who	was	the	best	James	Bond	villain?	Whether	there	really	was	extra-</p>
<p class="calibre1">terrestrial	life?	Who	was	the	best	English	striker	of	all	time?	Which	members	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 latest	 boy-band	 sensation	 could	 actually	 carry	 a	 tune	 without	 the	 help	 of	 a mixing	deck? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	still	treasured	the	handwritten	diary	he	kept	to	record	what	they	saw	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 eleventh-storey	 panoramic	 view	 of	 the	 city.	 He	 tracked	 the	 movement	 of police	vehicles.	Counted	the	helicopters	ferrying	personnel	in	and	out.	The	day</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	army	arrived	and	started	knocking	on	doors	to	evacuate	whoever	remained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	remembered	the	day	they	first	noticed	that	passenger	jets	had	stopped	taking</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	from	Southampton	airport	a	few	miles	away.	The	unrelenting	silence,	broken</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	by	car	alarms	set	off	by	the	last	of	the	looters.	Each	event	noted	with	times</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	approximate	locations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	had	debated	whether	to	leave	the	city,	afraid	of	contracting	the	sickness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Howard	 talked	 of	 other	 dangers.	 Cholera	 and	 worse.	 Too	 many	 bodies	 left</p>
<p class="calibre1">unburied,	 he	 said.	 Rats	 would	 spread	 disease.	 It	 was	 only	 a	 question	 of	 time before	 things	 deteriorated	 further.	 In	 the	 bedsit,	 they	 had	 been	 safe,	 rationing their	food	and	water	for	as	long	as	possible.	In	a	few	weeks,	they	hoped	the	virus</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	die	out,	along	with	most	of	those	infected,	giving	them	safe	passage	out	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 city.	 They	 planned	 to	 head	 south-west	 towards	 Lymington	 where	 his	 aunt lived	and	try	to	find	a	fishing	boat	or	a	yacht	to	take	them	to	France. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 nights	 had	 been	 long	 and	 spent	 in	 total	 darkness.	 They	 conserved	 their candles	 and	 torch	 batteries	 for	 when	 they	 were	 preparing	 meals.	 When	 it	 got dark,	 there	 was	 nothing	 to	 do	 but	 sleep.	 They	 watched	 the	 stars	 from	 their balcony	window,	telling	stories,	reminiscing	about	school	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	fifty-five	days	the	food	ran	out.	They	searched	the	other	flats	for	tinned</p>
<p class="calibre1">goods,	 or	 anything	 that	 was	 still	 edible,	 exhausting	 all	 that	 remained.	 Hungry and	 thirsty,	 they	 waited	 as	 long	 as	 they	 dared	 before	 setting	 out	 for	 Aunt Harriet’s	town	house	in	Lymington.	He	hadn’t	been	sure	whether	she	would	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	there,	but	it	was	as	good	a	place	as	any	to	head	for.	He	could	still	picture	the views	over	the	estuary	and	glimpses	of	the	Solent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	remembered	the	day	they	left	the	tower	block	for	the	last	time,	lowering</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 kit	 down	 a	 rope	 from	 a	 second-floor	 window	 before	 clambering	 after	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	loaded	the	Transit	van	in	silence	with	what	remained	of	their	supplies	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">set	out	along	back	streets	and	alleyways,	choked	with	abandoned	vehicles.	After</p>
<p class="calibre1">several	 miles	 of	 slow	 progress	 heading	 out	 of	 the	 city,	 they	 had	 swung	 south towards	Hythe,	hugging	the	coastline,	avoiding	the	main	roads	through	the	New</p>
<p class="calibre1">Forest.	 Rounding	 two	 vehicles	 locked	 together	 in	 a	 head-on	 collision,	 they	 got</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a>the	van	stuck	in	a	deep	ditch,	its	front	wheels	spinning	uselessly	in	muddy	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	a	winch	and	a	truck,	there	had	been	no	way	of	getting	it	out	again,	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	continued	the	rest	of	their	journey	on	foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	further	than	they	realised.	They	had	no	map	and	only	a	pocket	compass</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 a	 mind	 of	 its	 own,	 but	 figured	 that	 if	 they	 stayed	 close	 to	 the	 coast,	 they would	 get	 there	 eventually.	 It	 took	 them	 the	 best	 part	 of	 two	 days.	 Keeping	 to footpaths	 that	 sometimes	 ran	 deep	 into	 the	 forest,	 crossing	 fields	 left	 to	 grow wild,	 sleeping	 in	 deserted	 farmhouses.	 When	 they	 finally	 reached	 Lymington River,	 they	 found	 themselves	 opposite	 the	 ferry	 port	 and	 single-track	 railway station.	 Walking	 into	 town,	 they	 caught	 sight	 of	 other	 survivors	 and	 kept	 their distance.	 Their	 large	 backpacks	 caught	 the	 attention	 of	 those	 they	 passed	 who chased	them	into	nearby	fields. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lying	 on	 the	 cold	 stone	 floor,	 Joe’s	 memory	 jumped	 forward	 to	 the	 fateful night	of	the	attack.	Raised	voices	in	the	street,	someone	banging	relentlessly	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 door.	 Somehow	 they	 had	 found	 a	 way	 in,	 smashing	 through	 a	 ground-floor window,	even	though	it	was	shuttered	and	padlocked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 had	 replayed	 the	 following	 minutes	 again	 and	 again	 in	 his	 head.	 Stupid and	careless.	They	had	fallen	asleep	with	the	candle	burning.	Somehow	the	light</p>
<p class="calibre1">must	 have	 been	 visible	 from	 the	 street	 below	 through	 closed	 curtains.	 They didn’t	 stand	 a	 chance,	 there	 were	 too	 many	 of	 them,	 torches	 flashed	 in	 faces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Howard	 fought	 back	 and	 was	 stabbed	 in	 the	 stomach,	 Joe	 was	 badly	 beaten. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	took	their	rucksacks	and	left	them	for	dead.	Joe	held	Howard’s	hand	as	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">colour	 drained	 from	 his	 face.	 His	 pulse	 grew	 fainter	 until	 the	 touch	 of	 his	 skin grew	cold	and	his	body	stiffened.	After	that,	Joe	must	have	passed	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	Zed	who	found	Joe	with	broken	ribs	and	a	fractured	jaw.	They	pulled</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	 out,	 cleaned	 him	 up,	 carried	 him	 to	 the	 Land	 Rover.	 Riley	 tended	 to	 his wounds,	 whispering	 soothing	 words	 to	 keep	 him	 conscious.	 He	 could	 still</p>
<p class="calibre1">picture	Riley’s	face,	her	long	brown	hair,	her	even	smile,	her	green	eyes.	In	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">permanent	half-light	of	the	cellar,	he	felt	he	could	reach	out	and	touch	her,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 image	 was	 temporary.	 The	 rest	 of	 his	 group	 was	 most	 likely	 back	 at	 the castle	by	now,	wondering	where	he	was.	He	shuddered,	remembering	that	no	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew	what	had	become	of	him.	He	was	on	his	own.	This	time	there	would	be	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">chance	of	rescue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 looked	 deep	 within	 himself,	 wondering	 whether	 he	 had	 the	 courage	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">strength	to	carry	on.	His	second	incarceration	in	a	week.	Out	of	the	frying	pan</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	into	the	fire.	Was	this	his	punishment	for	finally	giving	in	to	carnal	pleasure at	 the	 hotel?	 His	 first	 time,	 after	 so	 much	 anticipation,	 had	 been	 purely functional.	 No	 talking.	 Watched	 by	 the	 guard.	 Then	 his	 first	 was	 quickly followed	 by	 several	 more.	 Each	 partner	 different	 and	 exciting,	 yet	 devoid	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a>emotional	 connection.	 An	 exchange	 of	 services.	 Few	 words.	 The	 guard	 had called	 him	 a	 breeder.	 An	 underclass	 to	 the	 women	 who	 used	 him.	 To	 them	 he was	 no	 better	 than	 an	 animal.	 He	 wondered	 what	 real	 love	 would	 feel	 like	 and whether	 he	 would	 live	 long	 enough	 to	 experience	 it.	 Mila.	 He	 thought	 of	 his beautiful	Mila,	a	smile	forming	on	his	lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	twisted	his	body,	rolling	over	on	his	back	as	his	thoughts	turned	to	Jean, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	young	girl	he	had	come	here	with.	The	girl	he	had	put	his	life	on	the	line	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">try	and	protect.	Look	where	that	had	got	him.	An	idea	began	to	form	in	his	mind, </p>
<p class="calibre1">building	slowly	like	a	ray	of	light	barely	visible,	half	imagined.	Jean	and	he	were partners	 now,	 they	 both	 shared	 a	 common	 enemy.	 Seamus	 would	 get	 what	 was coming	 to	 him.	 He	 would	 teach	 that	 bastard	 a	 lesson.	 He	 was	 suddenly	 filled with	 hope.	 Jean	 would	 find	 a	 way.	 She	 was	 young	 but	 also	 resourceful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow	 he	 had	 to	 believe	 she	 would	 get	 him	 out	 of	 here.	 He	 just	 needed	 to hold	on	and	stay	strong,	whatever	happened.	Right	now,	hope	and	faith	were	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	had	left.	He	had	come	so	far	to	get	to	this	point.	He	owed	it	to	Howard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	 the	 kitchen	 above	 came	 the	 sound	 of	 raucous	 laughter	 and	 a	 chair</p>
<p class="calibre1">scraping	on	the	stone	floor.	The	door	at	the	top	of	the	stairs	swung	open	on	its</p>
<p class="calibre1">hinges	 and	 he	 heard	 the	 heavy	 clump	 of	 boots	 coming	 down	 the	 narrow	 steps towards	 the	 cellar.	 Joe	 looked	 back	 up	 into	 the	 light	 from	 the	 small	 window shrouded	 in	 foliage	 and	 whispered	 a	 silent	 prayer,	 repeating	 over	 and	 over:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Forgive	us	our	trespasses	–	deliver	us	from	evil”. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	rolled	over	and	managed	to	get	himself	up	into	a	kneeling	position.	If	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 could	 get	 to	 his	 feet,	 he	 could	 try	 something.	 His	 legs	 were	 numb	 and unresponsive.	The	renewed	blood	flow	caused	agonising	shooting	pains. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Footsteps	 stopped	 outside	 the	 door	 as	 he	 heard	 the	 rattle	 of	 keys.	 With	 a grimace	he	levered	himself	into	a	crouch,	using	the	chair	to	support	his	weight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	rocked	back	uncomfortably	on	to	the	tips	of	his	toes	and	as	the	door	opened</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	launched	himself	forward	with	all	his	might,	catching	his	abuser	completely</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	surprise,	barging	him	backwards.	The	man	smashed	his	head	back	against	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">brick	wall.	Joe	was	on	him	quickly	before	he	could	recover.	Pressing	his	elbow</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	the	man’s	throat,	throttling	him	until	he	lay	still.	Joe	wasn’t	sure	if	he	was dead	or	just	unconscious.	It	didn’t	matter	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 a	 call	 from	 the	 kitchen	 above.	 A	 question	 left	 unanswered.	 The voice	was	slurred	and	uncertain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	checked	the	man’s	pockets	and	found	a	small	kitchen	knife.	He	stopped</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 a	 second,	 listening	 carefully	 for	 any	 further	 movement	 on	 the	 floor	 above. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 several	 attempts,	 dropping	 the	 knife	 on	 the	 floor,	 he	 held	 the	 blade between	 his	 knees	 and	 moved	 his	 wrists	 backwards	 and	 forwards	 against	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a>serrated	 edge	 as	 the	 bungee	 cord	 began	 to	 fray.	 He	 freed	 his	 legs	 and	 stood painfully,	 braced	 against	 the	 wall.	 He	 looked	 up	 the	 stairwell	 to	 the	 kitchen, trying	to	remember	the	layout.	With	the	knife	in	his	right	hand,	he	climbed	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">stairs	looking	for	Jean	and	Seamus. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Forty</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It	had	been	a	frustrating	night	for	Copper	and	his	men.	Ahead	of	their	attack	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hurst	Castle	later	that	evening	the	weather	had	deteriorated	rapidly.	A	local	man, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 called	 Trevor,	 stood	 at	 the	 doorway,	 sniffing	 at	 the	 wind,	 making	 faces	 at the	 darkening	 sky,	 where	 grey	 clouds	 were	 gathering	 over	 the	 Ship	 Inn	 on Lymington	quay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trevor	reckoned	it	was	blowing	a	force	six,	but	gusting	seven	or	eight,	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">big	sea	swell	to	go	with	it.	It	was	also	a	south-westerly	wind,	far	from	ideal	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	intended	beach	landing	on	the	exposed	spit	facing	the	Needles	rocks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	 watched	 from	 the	 shadows	 as	 the	 two	 leaders	 conferred	 for	 several</p>
<p class="calibre1">minutes	 in	 heated	 debate.	 The	 man	 in	 black	 finally	 gave	 in	 to	 common	 sense, postponing	the	attack	until	the	following	night,	providing	the	weather	improved</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 meantime.	 Copper	 seemed	 impatient,	 perhaps	 realising	 his	 men	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">psyched	and	ready	to	go.	Will	knew	from	bitter	experience	that	delays	weakened</p>
<p class="calibre1">resolve	 and	 would	 dull	 the	 men’s	 edge	 as	 a	 fighting	 force.	 They	 had	 all	 been cooped	 up	 in	 the	 pub	 for	 most	 of	 the	 day.	 They	 were	 restless	 and	 baying	 for blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Copper	strode	back	into	the	bar	with	confirmation	of	the	bad	news.	“Attack’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">off,	 boys.”	 There	 was	 a	 chorus	 of	 disapproval	 and	 disappointment.	 “No,	 listen, he’s	right,	it’s	too	dangerous	for	a	beach	assault	tonight.	We	wouldn’t	be	able	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">land	where	we	need	to.	And	with	the	swell,	someone’s	going	to	drown,	and	I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather	it	wasn’t	one	of	you	lot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will’s	 wrists	 were	 still	 cuffed	 behind	 his	 back.	 The	 plastic	 ties	 were	 biting and	chafing	but	if	he	sat	very	still,	leaning	forward,	he	found	the	pain	lessened</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	he	could	get	the	blood	flowing	all	the	way	to	his	fingers	if	he	wiggled	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">slowly.	 He	 was	 racking	 his	 brains	 to	 figure	 out	 a	 way	 to	 get	 a	 message	 to	 his friends	 at	 Hurst	 to	 warn	 them	 of	 the	 impending	 attack.	 He	 had	 been	 trying	 to make	eye	contact	with	the	landlord	and	his	daughter,	but	they	had	not	looked	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">way.	Will	was	watching	them	carefully,	observing	their	interactions	with	Copper</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	others,	trying	to	determine	whether	their	loyalty	to	Copper	was	feigned</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	real. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	landlord’s	daughter	collected	the	empty	bowls	from	the	dinner	they	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">served	 the	 hungry	 men.	 It	 wasn’t	 much,	 just	 some	 soup	 made	 from	 boiled</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a>vegetables,	 followed	 by	 a	 few	 chunks	 of	 “Fruit	 and	 Nut”	 chocolate	 they	 had liberated	from	a	vending	machine.	They	took	it	in	turns	to	swig	from	a	bottle	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cointreau	the	landlord	had	found	behind	a	catering	fridge.	He	was	saving	it	for	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">special	occasion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 the	 girl	 was	 within	 earshot,	 Will	 whispered	 the	 words	 “Help	 me”	 as loudly	 as	 he	 dared.	 She	 looked	 at	 him	 and	 very	 deliberately	 shook	 her	 head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please,”	he	implored.	As	she	approached	his	table,	he	noticed	she	walked	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">slight	limp	in	her	left	leg.	She	reached	across	and	started	wiping	the	table	nearest him	with	a	cloth,	even	though	it	looked	spotless.	She	leaned	close,	looking	past</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	shoulder.	Her	long	brown	hair	brushed	against	his	right	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ll	kill	me	if	I	help	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	they’ll	kill	me	if	you	don’t.”	He	smiled	wanly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	he	could	say	anything	else	she	moved	on	to	the	next	table,	but	glanced</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	at	him	from	behind	the	bar	counter.	He	wasn’t	sure	if	he	could	trust	her,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">right	now,	she	was	his	best	and	only	option. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 the	 attack	 off	 for	 the	 night,	 Copper	 took	 some	 of	 the	 men	 on	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">scavenging	 mission,	 more	 to	 pass	 the	 time	 than	 for	 any	 real	 purpose.	 They already	had	with	them	everything	they	needed.	But	as	Copper	had	said,	it	didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">pay	 to	 have	 the	 men	 stuck	 in	 close	 quarters	 for	 hours	 on	 end.	 Like	 dogs	 and small	 children,	 his	 men	 needed	 daily	 exercise.	 They	 had	 all	 seen	 too	 many arguments	boil	over	into	fistfights	and	worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	 watched	 the	 way	 Copper	 interacted	 with	 the	 others.	 There	 was	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">question:	his	men	respected,	even	liked	him.	Perhaps	there	was	more	to	Copper</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	met	the	eye.	He	seemed	full	of	contradictions	that	kept	Will	guessing.	With</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 men,	 he	 was	 affable,	 humorous,	 even	 charming.	 The	 former	 policeman</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	 to	 defy	 categorisation.	 He	 had	 come	 to	 know	 him	 as	 cruel	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">dispassionate,	adept	at	extracting	information	through	torture.	Copper	could	be	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">vicious	and	vindictive	bastard	who	thought	nothing	of	beating	or	even	killing	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 it	 came	 to	 Copper’s	 interactions	 with	 his	 boss,	 Will	 was	 under	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">illusions	 that	 the	 passive-aggressive	 behaviour	 betrayed	 a	 growing	 sense	 of frustration	 with	 his	 leader.	 Beyond	 the	 adopted	 mask	 of	 ruthlessness	 was	 the man	 in	 black	 simply	 a	 weak	 bully	 playing	 a	 part,	 living	 up	 to	 his	 men’s expectations? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	turned	his	attention	to	the	rest	of	Copper’s	squad.	Their	stab-proof	vests</p>
<p class="calibre1">exaggerated	 their	 size	 and	 bulk,	 but	 underneath	 they	 were	 fit	 and	 lean.	 In	 their adjusted	 roles,	 he	 smiled	 inwardly,	 there	 were	 undoubtedly	 fewer	 opportunities for	 sitting	 on	 their	 backsides	 eating	 donuts.	 His	 second	 in	 command,	 the	 man they	 called	 Sarge,	 like	 Copper	 had	 served	 in	 the	 local	 constabulary	 so	 he	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>familiar	with	police	tactics	and	had	some	basic	training	with	handling	weapons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 were	 barely	 recognisable	 as	 enforcers	 of	 the	 law.	 All	 police	 insignia	 had been	removed.	The	laws	they	followed	were	mostly	of	their	own	making.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	to	live	by	a	code,	a	mutual	respect	of	each	other,	of	hard	work,	discipline</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 determination.	 That	 didn’t	 mean	 that	 they	 had	 suddenly	 become	 bad	 men, but	 their	 frame	 of	 reference	 was	 somewhat	 altered.	 Their	 filters	 had	 been removed	and	the	justice	they	dispensed	was	a	little	more	direct	and	violent.	Their</p>
<p class="calibre1">loyalty	was	now	to	Copper,	pure	and	simple. </p><p class="calibre1">

<p class="calibre1">lying	 on	 one	 of	 the	 padded	 bench	 seats	 under	 the	 blacked-out	 window	 of	 the pub.	He	woke	after	a	couple	of	hours	with	his	right	arm	numb	and	tingling.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">stood	and	stretched	his	legs,	walking	around	the	slumbering	figures	laid	out	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 floor.	 The	 dim	 light	 from	 a	 lone	 candle	 cast	 flickering	 shadows	 round	 the room.	Voices	from	the	other	room	suggested	several	of	the	men	were	still	awake, </p>
<p class="calibre1">keeping	watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	the	bar	Will	spotted	the	landlord’s	daughter.	She	made	as	if	to	leave</p>
<p class="calibre1">but	he	stretched	out	and	grabbed	her	wrist	before	she	could	turn	away.	She	didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">cry	 out	 but	 made	 it	 very	 clear	 that	 she	 didn’t	 want	 anything	 to	 do	 with	 him	 or what	he	had	to	say	to	her.	He	released	her	hand,	and	she	remained	standing	there, </p>
<p class="calibre1">rubbing	her	wrist.	She	made	no	attempt	to	leave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	anyone	sees	us	talking,	I’m	dead.	You’ve	got	two	minutes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	 nodded	 and	 started	 explaining	 how	 in	 a	 few	 hours’	 time	 these	 men</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 launch	 an	 all-out	 attack	 on	 Hurst	 Castle.	 He	 begged	 her	 to	 help	 get	 a message	 to	 his	 friends.	 Their	 lives	 were	 in	 danger.	 He	 had	 to	 warn	 them	 some way,	 somehow,	 so	 that	 they	 could	 prepare	 themselves	 or	 get	 as	 far	 away	 as possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	heard	him	out,	listening	dispassionately	to	his	story.	Her	face	was	hard	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">read.	She	seemed	empathetic	but	eager	not	to	take	sides	in	someone	else’s	fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen.	You	seem	like	a	nice	person.	But	they	will	kill	me	and	my	father	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	find	out	I	helped	you.	I	don’t	have	a	choice.	It’s	too	much	to	ask.	If	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 another	 way,	 then	 maybe,	 but	 short	 of	 me	 going	 there	 myself,	 it	 can’t	 be done.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	knew	she	was	right,	but	that	didn’t	stop	him	from	trying,	for	the	sake	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	friends.	“Then	cut	me	loose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	uncertain,	playing	it	out	in	her	head,	trying	to	figure	out	whether</p>

<p class="calibre1">Will	persisted.	“There	must	be	another	way	out	of	here,	please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 checked	 no	 one	 was	 listening.	 Logic	 and	 reason	 were	 probably</p>
<p class="calibre1">screaming	at	her	not	to	get	involved.	She	struck	him	as	impulsive,	someone	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">liked	to	trust	her	instincts.	Doing	nothing	would	make	her	complicit	in	a	crime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 she	 could	 find	 a	 way	 to	 help	 him	 and	 have	 plausible	 deniability	 when questioned,	then	it	became	a	win-win. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	Copper’s	men	stirred	on	the	floor,	fidgeting	in	his	sleeping	bag,	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned	 over	 and	 went	 back	 to	 sleep.	 She	 waited	 until	 his	 snoring	 resumed	 and turned	back	to	Will,	her	mind	made	up.	She	leaned	her	head	towards	him	across</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	following	morning	the	wind	direction	veered	to	the	south,	and	its	intensity</p>
<p class="calibre1">abated	 sufficiently	 for	 Trevor	 to	 consider	 sanctioning	 the	 boats’	 departure.	 It remained	a	risky	venture,	but	an	acceptable,	calculated	one.	There	would	still	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 strong	 sea	 swell	 to	 contend	 with,	 but	 all	 things	 considered,	 the	 attack	 should proceed	with	all	urgency.	The	attack	on	Hurst	was	back	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Storm	 clouds	 hurried	 across	 the	 horizon.	 The	 bad	 weather	 was	 more	 distant now,	giving	way	to	a	milder	spring	evening	in	Lymington,	overcast	and	dry.	In	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">couple	 of	 hours	 it	 would	 be	 sunset.	 The	 sun	 was	 sinking	 rapidly	 behind	 the mainly	Georgian	houses	and	cottages	that	lined	the	high	street	and	surrounding</p>
<p class="calibre1">roads	leading	down	to	the	cobbled	alleys	and	quayside	of	the	harbour.	It	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 dark	 by	 seven	 thirty.	 A	 half-moon	 meant	 there	 would	 be	 just	 enough	 light, giving	the	attackers	a	further	advantage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">High	 tide	 was	 set	 for	 around	 midnight.	 Their	 plan	 was	 to	 cast	 off	 in	 the failing	light	and	head	down	the	river	estuary.	Trevor	had	sailed	these	waters	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 life.	 He	 was	 well	 aware	 of	 the	 shallower	 waters	 and	 treacherous	 mudflats weaving	their	way	down	river	towards	the	main	channel,	heading	west	towards</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hurst.	 Their	 arrival	 was	 timed	 to	 coincide	 with	 when	 they	 expected	 most	 of Hurst’s	 occupants	 to	 be	 fast	 asleep	 in	 their	 beds.	 A	 nominal	 force	 would	 be protecting	 what	 amounted	 to	 a	 very	 large	 site	 with	 walls	 stretching	 over	 five hundred	metres.	They	 knew	from	the	 intelligence	they	had	 extracted	from	Will</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 Hurst’s	 leaders	 mistakenly	 believed	 that	 the	 site’s	 remoteness	 and	 relative inaccessibility,	with	ten-metre-high	walls,	made	their	base	virtually	impregnable</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	an	attacking	force.	Their	pride	and	arrogance,	said	the	man	in	black,	would	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	downfall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet	history	was	on	their	side.	Will	knew	from	Scottie’s	incessant	stories	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hurst’s	 walls	 had	 never	 been	 breached	 in	 all	 its	 near	 five	 hundred	 years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever	 the	 man	 in	 black	 had	 learned	 from	 the	 interrogation,	 Will	 hoped beyond	hope	that	he	hadn’t	revealed	Hurst’s	security	protocols,	guard	patrols	or</p>

<p class="calibre1">time.	 There	 had	 been	 no	 need	 for	 their	 more	 experimental	 interrogation</p>
<p class="calibre1">techniques	 improvised	 from	 what	 they	 knew	 of	 waterboarding.	 In	 Will’s	 case they	had	simply	injected	him	with	a	cocktail	of	drugs	and	viciously	beaten	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p171"></a>It	was	crude	but	effective.	There	was	no	Geneva	Convention	to	protect	the	many captives	the	hospital	handled	on	a	weekly	basis.	They	had	grown	pretty	good	at</p>

The	man	in	black	congratulated	Copper	and	his	team. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walking	 amongst	 them	 with	 his	 hands	 on	 hips,	 he	 proudly	 inspected	 his	 foot soldiers.	They	were	as	ready	as	they	would	ever	be.	Providing	the	weather	held, </p>

<p class="calibre1">Will	blamed	his	poor	luck	and	bitterly	regretted	his	failure	to	escape	when	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">After	Will’s	midnight	rendezvous	with	the	landlord’s	daughter,	the	guard	shift</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	the	Ship	Inn	changed	and	one	of	Copper’s	most	trusted	men	had	been	charged</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	keeping	watch	over	their	prisoner.	Will	pretended	to	sleep,	running	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 execution	 of	 his	 plan,	 step	 by	 step,	 waiting	 for	 his	 guard	 to	 lose	 interest	 or drop	off.	Copper’s	men	were	professional	and	stuck	to	their	task,	unlike	some	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 others	 from	 the	 hospital	 without	 military	 or	 police	 training.	 He	 had	 learned through	bitter	experience,	they	were	mostly	nihilists	or	thugs	with	a	chip	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulder.	 Definitely	 worth	 avoiding	 eye	 contact.	 They	 tended	 to	 have	 a	 short fuse	and	a	thirst	for	violence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	 seven,	 with	 the	 light	 fading	 and	 the	 moon	 rising	 behind	 distant	 clouds, they	started	loading	up	the	boats	on	the	quay.	Copper	would	take	the	lead	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">first	R.I.B	with	four	of	his	best	men,	forming	the	tip	of	the	spear	of	the	attack.	In the	larger	pleasure	craft,	a	ferryboat	with	covered	main	cabin,	Sarge	would	lead</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 main	 force	 of	 some	 ten	 men,	 including	 Will	 and	 the	 man	 in	 black.	 The ferryboat	had	spent	a	lifetime	shuttling	tourists	to	the	Needles	rocks	and	back,	so was	shallow	draft	but	seaworthy,	ideal	for	their	purposes.	Last	but	not	least	was	a back-up	 team	 of	 four	 men	 in	 a	 second	 fast	 inflatable.	 They	 would	 be	 held	 in reserve	until	the	drawbridge	was	down	and	the	main	force	was	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	was	running	out	of	time.	With	the	attack	certain	to	go	ahead	tonight,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a>somehow	 had	 to	 find	 a	 way	 to	 escape.	 Hurst’s	 future	 hung	 in	 the	 balance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	depended	on	Will	now.	He	could	not	let	his	friends	down.	He	figured</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	would	take	at	least	two	and	a	half	hours	to	walk	back	to	the	castle.	He	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">picture	 the	 coastal	 footpath	 that	 ran	 along	 the	 estuary	 and	 marshlands	 towards Keyhaven.	If	he	jogged	most	of	the	way	then	he	could	probably	shave	an	hour</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	 that,	 but	 the	 thought	 of	 running	 in	 the	 tired	 old	 working	 boots	 he	 was wearing,	 having	 not	 run	 for	 months,	 filled	 him	 with	 dread.	 Years	 of	 unhealthy living,	Cornish	pasty	lunches	and	a	fondness	for	Ringwood	ale,	had	left	him	soft</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	the	middle.	The	last	couple	of	years	living	from	hand	to	mouth	had	done</p>
<p class="calibre1">remarkably	little	to	shift	that	flab.	He	had	at	least	lost	some	weight,	he	was	sure of	 that,	 just	 not	 in	 the	 places	 he	 tended	 to	 pay	 attention	 to.	 The	 chances	 of finding	a	bicycle	or	a	boat	were	slim,	but	he	might	get	lucky.	Lady	Luck	had	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">funny	way	of	smiling	on	him	when	he	least	expected	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 men	 ferrying	 equipment	 to	 the	 waiting	 boats,	 for	 a	 few moments,	 Will	 and	 his	 minder	 were	 the	 only	 people	 left	 in	 the	 pub.	 Will	 was pretending	to	sleep,	his	eyes	closed.	The	guard	was	distracted,	no	longer	paying</p>
<p class="calibre1">attention	to	Will.	The	landlord’s	daughter	was	polishing	glasses	behind	the	bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 had	 changed	 into	 figure-hugging	 jeans	 and	 was	 adjusting	 her	 hair	 in	 a mirror,	 applying	 some	 lipstick.	 She	 dropped	 her	 cloth	 and	 stretched	 down	 to retrieve	it.	Was	she	doing	it	on	purpose?	She	was	certainly	drawing	attention	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself,	whether	deliberate	or	not.	The	guard	now	had	his	back	to	Will.	He	seized</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	chance,	taking	him	completely	by	surprise.	His	body	low	like	a	rugby	tackle</p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 with	 his	 wrists	 still	 tied,	 he	 charged	 at	 the	 man,	 making	 contact	 with	 his shoulder,	barging	him	with	all	his	might.	The	guard	slammed	his	head	hard	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 wall,	 knocking	 over	 one	 of	 the	 tables.	 He	 lay	 still,	 stunned	 for	 a	 few moments.	 Will	 glanced	 back	 towards	 the	 landlord’s	 daughter.	 She	 waved	 him urgently	towards	the	back	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 wiggled	 under	 the	 hatchway	 on	 his	 hands	 and	 knees	 and	 got	 awkwardly</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	to	his	feet	behind	the	bar.	He	needed	to	keep	moving	fast	and	stay	unseen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keeping	 low,	 he	 ducked	 through	 a	 doorway	 that	 led	 to	 a	 corridor	 stacked	 with boxes.	 Empty	 beer	 kegs	 lined	 the	 far	 wall.	 A	 notice	 board	 fluttered	 with	 staff notices,	 and	 fliers	 for	 visiting	 bands.	 Stairs	 to	 the	 right	 led	 up	 to	 where	 he imagined	the	landlord	and	his	daughter	lived	above	the	pub.	She	had	been	good</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	her	word.	A	brick	blocked	the	fire	door	from	closing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside	it	was	pitch	black.	Will	blinked	into	the	darkness.	He	could	just	make</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	 a	 rusting	 iron	 gate	 that	 led	 to	 the	 car	 park.	 Over	 his	 shoulder	 he	 heard	 a woman’s	scream,	raised	voices	and	a	glass	smashing	on	the	ground.	He	only	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	few	moments	to	get	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	quietly	as	he	could	manage	in	all	the	excitement,	he	put	his	weight	against</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a>the	 heavy	 iron	 gate.	 He	 half	 expected	 a	 loud	 screech	 of	 rusted	 metal,	 but	 the mechanism	operated	silently	on	well-oiled	hinges.	Beyond	was	a	small	staff	car</p>
<p class="calibre1">park	at	the	rear	of	the	pub,	leading	to	a	cobbled	alleyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking	the	most	direct	route	was	a	big	risk,	but	he	simply	didn’t	have	time	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">backtrack	 through	 side	 streets.	 With	 a	 final	 look	 over	 his	 shoulder	 he	 raced	 up the	 cobbled	 hill	 to	 the	 bottom	 of	 the	 high	 street,	 his	 hands	 still	 tied	 behind	 his back.	 He	 darted	 left	 and	 jogged	 along	 the	 narrow	 lane	 lined	 with	 rows	 of whitewashed	 cottages	 and	 town	 houses	 running	 down	 towards	 the	 waterfront</p>
<p class="calibre1">marinas.	Turning	the	corner,	a	forest	of	masts	and	rigging	lay	ahead.	To	his	left, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 boatyard	 full	 of	 yachts	 and	 vessels	 lay	 in	 various	 states	 of	 disrepair,	 waiting their	turn	for	the	huge	crane	to	cradle	them	back	into	the	slow	running	waters	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 Lymington	 river.	 Beyond	 the	 boatyard	 and	 yacht	 clubs	 lay	 open	 fields	 and country	lanes.	Will	craved	the	darkness	and	solitude	of	the	asphalt	footpath	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">led	back	towards	Hurst. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Forty-two</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 and	 the	 others	 left	 guarding	 Hurst	 Castle	 had	 still	 not	 received	 word from	 the	 scavenging	 team.	 It	 was	 not	 the	 first	 time	 that	 their	 distance	 from	 the castle	had	required	an	overnight	stay,	but	when	they	still	hadn’t	returned	by	dusk</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 second	 day,	 the	 members	 of	 the	 council	 met	 in	 emergency	 session. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Protocol	 dictated	 that	 a	 search	 party	 be	 mounted	 but	 with	 Jack,	 Terra	 and	 Sam also	not	returned,	they	could	ill	afford	to	further	weaken	their	defences,	when	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	likelihood	they	could	all	be	back	at	any	moment.	Unknowingly,	the	castle	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	its	most	vulnerable	in	some	time,	and	its	occupants	were	dangerously	unaware</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	imminent	threat	to	their	security. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	courtyard,	Tommy	tossed	another	log	into	the	firepit.	The	red-hot	ash</p>
<p class="calibre1">spat	sparks	at	his	bare	ankles.	He	kicked	at	a	few	wood	ends	with	the	toe	of	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">boot	where	the	logs	had	burned	through,	sending	smoke	and	embers	curling	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	 the	 night	 sky.	 Long	 shadows	 danced	 on	 the	 steep	 walls	 of	 the	 castle	 that towered	 over	 the	 small	 group	 as	 they	 sat	 round	 in	 a	 semi-circle,	 telling	 stories and	enjoying	each	other’s	company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 stared	 unblinking	 into	 the	 heart	 of	 the	 fire.	 With	 a	 sigh,	 he	 reached behind	and	grabbed	another	log	from	the	pile	of	wood	they	had	unloaded	earlier</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	trailer.	He	resumed	his	seat	next	to	Liz.	She	handed	him	her	half-empty</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	 of	 lager,	 toasting	 the	 assembled	 company:	 “Here’s	 to	 our	 new	 American friends.	May	they	bring	us	better	food:	hamburgers,	pizzas	and	hot	dogs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	save	us	from	Liz’s	cooking,”	added	Tommy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scottie	 and	 Greta	 raised	 their	 cans	 while	 Liz	 delivered	 a	 two-fingered</p>
<p class="calibre1">response,	adding,	“Very	funny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scottie’s	lilting	voice	from	the	other	side	of	the	fire	added	to	their	toasts.	“To</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hurst.	May	Jack	and	Terra	bring	us	good	fortune,	and,	aye,	better	food.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Remind	 me	 what	 we’re	 really	 celebrating?”	 asked	 Greta,	 toasting	 her	 toes against	the	blazing	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 don’t	 be	 such	 a	 grouch,”	 joked	 Tommy.	 “Do	 we	 really	 need	 a	 reason? </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’re	alive.	Isn’t	that	enough?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	suppose.	When	the	cat’s	away,	the	mice	will	play,”	added	Scottie,	lounging</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	against	Greta’s	bare	legs.	She	stroked	the	back	of	his	head	affectionately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 scowled	 at	 their	 quiet	 intimacy.	 It	 bothered	 him	 that	 Scottie,	 of	 all</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a>people,	 had	 scored	 the	 best-looking	 girl	 at	 the	 castle.	 A	 slightly	 effeminate Scotsman	 at	 that.	 There	 was	 no	 justice.	 Greta	 had	 her	 eyes	 closed,	 her	 head turned	towards	Liz.	It	looked	almost	like	she	was	seeking	her	friend’s	approval. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,	Liz.	What	do	you	miss	most	about	the	way	things	were?”	asked</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scottie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Internet,	for	one.	The	world	seems	so	much	smaller	now.	We’re	so	cut</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	from	the	rest	of	the	world.	I	kind	of	like	that,”	answered	Liz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	 you	 not	 a	 wee	 bit	 curious	 to	 know	 what’s	 going	 on	 out	 there?”	 added Scottie.	 “Don’t	 you	 miss	 that	 feeling	 of	 being	 connected?	 Being	 part	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	bigger.	I	don’t	know,	the	scope	and	scale	of	the	way	things	were.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	miss	the	people,	that’s	for	sure,”	said	Liz.	“My	family,	my	friends.	I	miss</p>
<p class="calibre1">stupid	stuff	like	Sunday	newspapers,	taking	the	day	to	read	all	the	supplements.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">miss	 sitting	 in	 a	 pub	 next	 to	 a	 roaring	 fire,	 drinking	 Ringwood	 ale	 pumped	 by hand.	 I	 miss	 the	 Colemanballs	 column	 in	  <i class="calibre4">Private	 Eye</i>.	 So	 many	 things	 we	 just took	for	granted.	What	about	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	miss	going	to	the	Rose	Bowl	to	see	Test	match	cricket.	I	appreciate	that’s	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">wee	 bit	 odd	 for	 a	 Scotsman	 but	 I	 loved	 it.	 What’s	 not	 to	 like?	 Beer	 snakes, Mexican	 waves	 and	 the	 barmy	 army.	 Anyone	 remember	 stewards	 wading	 into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 crowd	 to	 grab	 ten-feet-high	 stacks	 of	 empty	 plastic	 glasses?	 What	 a	 sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ridiculous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	all	laughed,	lost	in	memories.	Tommy	was	silent	staring	into	the	fire,	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">shapes	and	figures	danced	in	the	flames.	He	let	out	a	deep	sigh	and	lamented,	“I</p>
<p class="calibre1">miss	 summer	 holidays	 to	 Spain	 with	 Laura.”	 The	 others	 shouted	 catcalls	 in	 his direction,	mocking	his	sentimentality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“More	like	holiday	with	your	mum,”	derided	Liz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 spun	 round	 and	 scowled	 in	 her	 direction	 before	 continuing</p>
<p class="calibre1">undeterred,	unable	to	suppress	a	smile.	“No,	seriously,	we	went	this	one	time	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Palma,	 Majorca.	 Sandy	 beaches,	 sunburned	 Brits,	 beer	 bellies	 and	 cheap</p>
<p class="calibre1">cocktails.	It	was	brilliant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Remember	 just	 going	 on	 a	 plane	 to	 somewhere	 far	 away?	 Airports?	 Duty-</p>
<p class="calibre1">free?	Needing	a	passport?”	said	Greta. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scottie	went	next.	“I	miss	live	music,	going	to	see	a	rock	band	at	Wembley</p>
<p class="calibre1">Stadium.	 Seeing	 Rod	 Stewart,	 U2,	 or	 Bruce	 Springsteen.	 Thousands	 of	 fans</p>
<p class="calibre1">packed	together,	dancing,	cheering,	laughing.	Those	were	the	days.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	group	fell	silent,	overwhelmed	by	a	hundred	memories,	each	lost	in	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">own	 private	 reverie.	 Greta’s	 voice	 broke	 the	 silence,	 sounding	 fragile,	 perhaps fearful	 of	 the	 answer.	 “Do	 you	 think	 things	 will	 ever	 get	 back	 to	 the	 way	 they were?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course,”	responded	Scottie,	without	hesitation.	“We	gotta	believe	that.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a>may	 take	 time,	 but	 it’ll	 happen.	 Maybe,	 things	 won’t	 be	 exactly	 the	 same,	 but come	on,	humans	are	a	resilient	bunch.	We’ve	faced	similar	threats	to	our	way	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">life.	 Just	 think.	 The	 bubonic	 plague,	 Spanish	 flu,	 acts	 of	 God	 like	 earthquakes, meteor	 strikes,	 typhoons.	 Then	 there	 was	 the	 Holocaust,	 world	 wars,	 nuclear explosions,	the	list	goes	on,	and	somehow,	life	finds	a	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 dinosaurs	 didn’t	 fare	 too	 well,”	 challenged	 Tommy,	 smirking</p>
<p class="calibre1">mischievously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	 but	 how	 many	 times	 has	 that	 happened	 in,	 like,	 a	 hundred	 billion years	 of	 history	 on	 this	 planet?	 A	 true	 global	 killer?	 Once,	 in	 like,	 ever?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">continued	 Scottie.	 “And	 we’re	 only	 talking	 about	 an	 extinction	 event	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">humans,	not	all	the	other	animals	and	insects	and	life	on	this	planet.	Life	goes	on regardless.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	 knows?	 Maybe	 humans	 are	 the	 next	 lemming,	 or	 dodo,	 driven	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">extinction	by	forces	beyond	their	control?”	added	Liz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	doubt	it,”	reassured	Scottie.	“Humankind	has	a	good	record	of	overcoming</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	odds,	triumphing	in	the	face	of	adversity.	It’ll	be	like	that	again.	Somewhere, somehow	 it	 stands	 to	 reason	 that	 someone	 is	 doing	 better	 than	 us.	 We	 can’t	 be the	only	ones	to	have	survived.	Maybe	whole	populations,	whole	countries	even, </p>
<p class="calibre1">have	immunity.	There	might	be	some	gene	that	protects	them	from	getting	it.	Or</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	warmer	climate	prevented	a	flu-like	virus	from	taking	hold	in	the	first	place? </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	might	be	a	vaccine	already,	a	cure	for	the	virus.	You	never	know,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 wonder	 how	 Jack	 and	 Terra	 are	 getting	 on,”	 said	 Tommy,	 changing	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">subject.	“They	wouldn’t	say	much	about	their	trip	or	why	they	were	going.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	got	to	be	something	to	do	with	the	Americans,”	reckoned	Liz.	“Nathan</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	 it	 was	 all	 top	 secret	 and	 he	 couldn’t	 breathe	 a	 word	 about	 it.	 All	 sounded very	 mysterious.”	 She	 winked	 at	 Scottie.	 There	 was	 playful	 mischief	 between them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	leaned	forward,	animated	and	energised	by	something.	“What	if	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 a	 whole	 convoy	 of	 ships	 heading	 our	 way	 right	 this	 very	 moment?	 Some massive	 rescue	 mission.	 Maybe	 they’re	 evacuating	 Britain	 and	 they	 need	 our help.	Typical	Americans,	always	have	to	save	the	world.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,	trust	the	Americans	to	turn	up	two	years	late.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wouldn’t	go	getting	people’s	hopes,”	cautioned	Scottie.	“There’s	not	going</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 be	 any	 relief	 convoy.	 I	 seriously	 doubt	 there’s	 anyone	 left	 to	 rescue	 us.	 The rest	of	the	world	is	probably	in	just	as	much	of	a	mess	as	we	are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	 one	 knows	 that	 for	 sure,”	 said	 Tommy,	 shaking	 his	 head.	 “The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Americans	always	save	the	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	 been	 watching	 too	 many	 disaster	 movies.	 No	 way	 Will	 Smith	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	to	save	us	this	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a>“When	 the	 Americans	 come,	 they’ll	 do	 it	 in	 style.	 It’s	 normally,	 like	 now, when	 Britain’s	 on	 its	 knees,	 they	 show	 up	 and	 turn	 the	 tide.	 Two	 world	 wars proved	that.”	Tommy	paused,	troubled	by	something	he	remembered.	It	was	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	feeling,	a	hunch	really,	that	had	been	nagging	him.	“There	was	something	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt	wrong	when	they	refused	to	tell	us	anything.	Makes	you	wonder	whose	side</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’re	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 we’re	 on	 the	 same	 side	 all	 right,”	 reassured	 Scottie.	 The	 man	 with	 a thousand	 voices	 and	 accents	 affected	 an	 Alabama	 drawl	 straight	 from	 the	 deep south,	 reprising	 the	 role	 of	 Atticus	 Finch	 from	  <i class="calibre4">To	 Kill	 a	 Mocking	 Bird</i>.	 He continued	in	character:	“Right	now,	there’s	a	whole	task	force	en	route	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">US	 of	 A.	 Ships	 filled	 with	 corned	 beef	 and	 ketchup.	 Frozen	 steaks	 as	 big	 as Frisbees.	Cheerleaders	with	pompoms.	Jet	fighters	streaming	red	white	and	blue</p>
<p class="calibre1">vapour	trails.	Ticker	tape	parades	on	the	docks	as	they	unload	crate	after	crate	of good	ol’	lite	beer,	flowing	from	every	porthole.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 didn’t	 look	 so	 sure.	 “Yeah,	 and	 pigs	 might	 fly.	 If	 you	 ask	 me,	 I reckon	 they’re	 up	 to	 no	 good.	 It's	 a	 land	 grab	 or	 they're	 here	 to	 steal	 all	 our supplies	before	moving	on,	like	locusts.	Don’t	worry,	Liz,	I’m	sure	they’ll	leave</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	stash	well	alone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz	 belted	 Tommy	 with	 the	 back	 of	 her	 hand	 and	 he	 fell	 backwards	 off	 his seat,	clutching	the	side	of	his	face.	“Hey,	there’s	no	need	for	violence,	woman.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’ll	learn	you,	big	mouth,”	said	one	of	the	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 glared	 back	 at	 Liz,	 dusting	 himself	 down.	 Greta	 stretched	 her	 thin arms	high	above	her	head,	sweater	pulled	tight	across	her	chest,	yawning	loudly</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	very	deliberately.	She	fluttered	her	eyelashes	in	Scottie’s	general	direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,	think	I’ll	turn	in.	You	coming?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 made	 to	 join	 her	 but	 she	 wagged	 her	 finger.	 “Not	 you,	 Tommy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scottie?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can’t.	Not	tonight.	I’m	on	watch,	with	this	reprobate.	I’ll	come	and	tuck	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	when	I’m	done.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	on	then,”	said	Liz,	getting	to	her	feet	a	little	slowly,	clutching	her	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	a	hard	day	in	the	kitchen.	“Early	start	tomorrow.	Best	turn	in	and	leave	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">boys	to	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Night,	Liz,	night,	Greta.	See	you	ladies	in	the	morning,”	said	Scottie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	women	wandered	off	into	the	darkness	towards	the	old	castle	keep, </p>
<p class="calibre1">leaving	 the	 remaining	 group	 following	 them	 with	 their	 eyes.	 A	 door	 slammed and	Nathan	appeared	out	of	the	gloom,	jangling	a	large	bunch	of	keys.	Tommy</p>
<p class="calibre1">smuggled	 his	 can	 of	 lager	 behind	 a	 trouser	 leg.	 Nathan	 didn’t	 approve	 of drinking,	particularly	when	someone	was	on	duty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everyone’s	accounted	for.	The	castle	is	yours.	Try	and	keep	it	together	out</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a>there	 tonight,	 yeah?

<p class="calibre1">“So	 these	 are	 quite	 literally	 the	 ‘keys	 to	 the	 castle’,”	 joked	 Tommy.	 “I’ve always	wanted	to	say	that.	You	know	we’ve	done	this	a	hundred	times	before?	I</p>

<p class="calibre1">“That’s	what	I’m	worried	about,	you	sleepwalking	again,”	said	Scottie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	to	see	you	try,”	came	a	voice	from	the	group	around	the	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	much	do	you	want	to	bet?”	boasted	Tommy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gentlemen,	 please.	 Just	 do	 your	 jobs.	 Just	 this	 once,	 try	 and	 behave	 like professionals,”	implored	Nathan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 pair	 of	 them	 burst	 out	 laughing.	 “Aw,	 we’re	 only	 pulling	 your	 leg, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nathan.	 We’ll	 do	 our	 best,	 don’t	 you	 worry.	 We’re	 a	 crack	 team,	 we	 are,	 ain’t we,	 Scottie?	 The	 A	 team.	 Butch	 Cassidy	 and	 the	 Sundance	 Kid,	 Batman	 and Robin,	Bonnie	and	Clyde,”	said	Tommy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bonnie	was	a	woman,	ya	giant	dunderhead,”	corrected	Scottie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,	 I’ll	 leave	 you	 to	 it,”	 said	 Nathan,	 growing	 tired	 of	 their	 levity.	 “No pranks,	 Tommy.	 Keep	 your	 eyes	 peeled	 for	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>	 and	 Zed’s	 team.	 They might	put	in	a	late	appearance.	Unlikely,	but	you	never	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	won’t	let	you	down,	will	we,	Tommy?	Come	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 two	 of	 them	 said	 their	 goodbyes	 and	 left	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 group	 to	 enjoy the	remains	of	the	fire.	Scottie	put	his	arm	around	Tommy,	meandering	unevenly</p>
<p class="calibre1">towards	 the	 armoury	 to	 collect	 a	 rifle	 each	 and	 the	 flare	 gun,	 in	 case	 of emergencies.	No	doubt	it	would	be	another	uneventful	night	like	all	the	others. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p179"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Forty-three</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lead	boat	carrying	Copper	and	his	men	was	making	steady	progress	up	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">channel.	 The	 wind	 had	 died,	 but	 there	 was	 still	 just	 enough	 breeze	 to	 disperse what	little	noise	they	were	making.	The	seventy-five	horse-power	twin	Yamaha</p>
<p class="calibre1">outboard	 engines	 drove	 them	 forward	 against	 the	 incoming	 tide.	 Trevor	 said	 it was	slackening	by	the	minute	as	it	neared	high	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Surprise	was	critical.	Copper’s	plans	depended	on	his	five-man	team	getting</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	the	wall	without	being	seen.	From	there,	they	would	make	their	way	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">main	 gate	 on	 the	 northern	 side	 of	 the	 fortifications,	 knock	 out	 the	 guards	 and secure	the	entrance	for	the	main	attack	group	waiting	for	their	signal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Copper	closed	his	eyes	he	had	a	mental	map	of	the	castle.	He’d	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	 once	 before	 on	 a	 date	 with	 a	 local	 girl	 years	 ago.	 It	 had	 been	 her suggestion,	 a	 boat	 trip	 from	 Keyhaven	 and	 a	 walking	 tour	 of	 the	 castle.	 It	 had rained	 the	 whole	 day	 and	 they	 cut	 their	 losses	 and	 made	 a	 cursory	 tour	 of	 the battlements.	 They	 saw	 the	 museum	 and	 displays,	 walked	 around	 the	 castle	 and took	 the	 early	 ferry	 home	 in	 time	 for	 fish	 and	 chips	 on	 the	 village	 green	 at Milford.	He	couldn’t	remember	her	name.	Sarah	or	Serena,	something	like	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	didn’t	matter	now,	she	was	likely	dead,	along	with	all	the	rest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 berated	 himself	 for	 his	 wandering	 thoughts.	 He	 needed	 to	 get	 his	 mind back	on	the	job	at	hand.	If	what	Will	had	told	them	was	to	be	trusted,	they	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">expect	only	limited	resistance.	Two	guards,	lightly	armed.	It	would	be	a	turkey</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoot.	 Once	 they	 had	 the	 two	 girls,	 Adele	 and	 Stella,	 together	 with	 the	 Hurst leaders,	the	rest	were	expendable.	They	didn’t	need	more	mouths	to	feed.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	all	the	human	specimens	they	needed	for	the	experiments.	Still,	if	there	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">young	 women	 amongst	 them,	 they	 might	 take	 a	 few	 back	 to	 keep	 the	 men</p>
<p class="calibre1">entertained.	After	all,	their	nights	were	long	and	dull.	Play	it	by	ear,	that’s	what he’d	do.	He	was	trusted	to	make	his	own	decisions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	they	passed	a	line	of	yachts	on	river	moorings,	the	rhythmic	throbbing	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">gurgling	 from	 the	 engines	 grew	 louder,	 echoing	 momentarily	 across	 the	 water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	nothing	they	could	do	about	it,	other	than	cut	the	engines	and	paddle</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	rest	of	the	way,	but	that	would	take	too	long.	The	engines	were	a	necessary</p>
<p class="calibre1">evil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trevor	was	keeping	to	the	left	side	of	the	channel,	staying	out	of	the	last	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p180"></a>the	 tide	 and	 keeping	 clear	 of	 the	 mudflats	 marked	 by	 wooden	 posts	 every	 fifty yards	 or	 so,	 leading	 them	 out	 towards	 open	 water	 at	 the	 mouth	 of	 Lymington River. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 R.I.B	 was	 built	 for	 coastguard	 use	 and	 maintained	 with	 the	 latest</p>
<p class="calibre1">equipment.	It	had	a	functioning	radio,	proper	seating	for	its	crew	of	four	to	six,	a powerful	searchlight,	together	with	oars	and	flares.	Copper’s	men	were	relaxed</p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 focused.	 None	 of	 them	 was	 particularly	 enjoying	 being	 out	 on	 the	 water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	a	few	green	faces	amongst	them	as	the	size	of	the	waves	grew	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	craft	began	to	pitch	and	yaw.	The	men	gripped	the	handles	nearest	them	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	 tighter	 as	 they	 were	 tossed	 around,	 bouncing	 off	 waves,	 buffeted	 by	 the wind	 which	 seemed	 to	 strengthen	 now	 they	 were	 beyond	 the	 shelter	 of	 the harbour	and	river	estuary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 distance	 they	 could	 see	 the	 dark	 outline	 of	 the	 castle.	 It	 looked enormous,	 more	 like	 a	 small	 citadel	 than	 a	 castle.	 Beyond	 Hurst	 Spit,	 on	 the other	side	of	the	Needles	channel	they	could	see	the	Isle	of	Wight.	A	shapeless</p>
<p class="calibre1">mass	in	total	darkness,	stretching	as	far	as	the	eye	could	see,	punctuated	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Needles	 rocks	 like	 giant	 jagged	 teeth,	 facing	 Christchurch	 Bay.	 The	 island	 was shielding	them	from	the	worst	of	the	wind,	blowing	in	from	the	Channel	Islands, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cherbourg	 peninsula	 and	 France.	 The	 remnants	 of	 the	 earlier	 storm	 had	 blown itself	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 a	 moment,	 the	 wind	 seemed	 to	 strengthen	 again,	 gusting	 and	 swirling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	 few	 seconds,	 a	 new	 torrent	 of	 water	 broke	 against	 the	 bow	 of	 the	 boat, soaking	 the	 men	 with	 spray.	 The	 engine	 note	 changed	 slightly,	 lost	 against	 the sound	 of	 their	 wash	 and	 waves.	 They	 turned	 their	 faces	 away	 from	 the	 wind, bracing	themselves	each	time	the	boat	pitched	into	a	new	wave.	In	a	few	minutes</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	clothes	and	equipment	were	soaked.	The	men	licked	salt	from	their	lips,	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">water	sloshed	around	their	feet,	making	the	floor	slippery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	castle	came	closer	into	view	and	they	could	make	out	the	battlements	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">towers	of	the	old	fort.	An	outline	of	a	lighthouse	towered	over	the	encampment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	dull	orange	glow	lit	up	the	inside	of	the	castle	walls.	Copper	guessed	it	must</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 a	 campfire.	 He	 smiled	 to	 himself.	 The	 fire	 would	 diminish	 the	 defender’s ability	to	see	anything	in	the	dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rounding	 the	 Hurst	 headland,	 their	 boat	 kept	 its	 distance	 from	 the	 beach, labouring	against	the	incoming	tide	that	flowed	faster	here,	funnelled	over	rocks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Copper’s	men	shrank	lower,	hidden	from	sight.	Copper	kept	his	eyes	focused	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	shoreline.	His	senses	were	alert,	ever	vigilant	for	any	waves	breaking	against</p>
<p class="calibre1">obstructions	in	the	water,	buoys,	posts,	or	fishing	nets.	He	was	fairly	sure	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	no	sea	defences	added	by	the	Hurst	crew	to	protect	against	shore	landings</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	an	invading	force.	The	pilot	checked	his	bearings	and	pointed	the	bow	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p181"></a>R.I.B	towards	the	beach	in	between	two	groynes,	nudging	Copper	to	make	sure he	was	happy	for	them	to	head	in.	Peering	over	the	bow	of	the	boat,	Copper	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	final	scan	and	gave	a	thumbs	up.	It	was	safe	to	proceed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Copper	was	under	no	illusions.	Despite	what	he	knew	of	Hurst’s	defences,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">told	 his	 men	 never	 to	 underestimate	 an	 adversary.	 The	 castle	 would	 be	 well defended.	A	significant	threat	that	needed	eliminating	once	and	for	all.	One	side</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	Copper’s	mouth	curled	upwards.	He	was	looking	forward	to	getting	his	own</p>
<p class="calibre1">back.	 As	 his	 boss	 was	 fond	 of	 saying,	 revenge	 is	 a	 dish	 best	 served	 cold.	 The pilot	killed	the	engines	and	they	surfed	the	rest	of	the	way	in	to	the	beach. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p182"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Forty-four</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	 was	 fairly	 sure	 that	 he	 was	 not	 being	 followed.	 After	 his	 headlong	 dash from	 the	 Ship	 Inn	 to	 the	 outskirts	 of	 Lymington,	 he	 paused,	 gasping	 for	 breath behind	an	abandoned	truck	near	the	town	sailing	club,	or	what	was	left	of	it.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 little	 more	 than	 a	 burned-out	 shell,	 ravaged	 by	 fire	 and	 the	 winter	 storms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 car	 park	 was	 part	 waterlogged,	 scattered	 with	 abandoned	 vehicles.	 They were	 of	 no	 use	 to	 Will.	 Most	 were	 rusting	 heaps,	 their	 batteries	 long	 since	 flat and	their	ignitions	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 the	 green,	 beside	 a	 band	 stand,	 he	 noticed	 a	 large	 mound,	 with	 black plastic	 sheeting	 flapping	 in	 the	 breeze.	 He	 squinted,	 trying	 to	 discern	 its	 shape and	 purpose	 in	 the	 darkness.	 With	 a	 shudder	 of	 realisation,	 he	 recognised	 it	 as man-made,	 like	 dozens	 of	 others	 scattered	 around	 the	 town.	 Bodies	 collected from	 the	 houses	 that	 lined	 the	 riverside,	 ready	 for	 collection	 and	 disposal	 by clean-up	crews	who	never	showed	up.	Perhaps	they	themselves	had	succumbed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 sickness.	 After	 all	 this	 time,	 he	 recognised	 the	 faint	 stench	 of	 decay,	 of bodies	left	to	decompose	above	ground.	A	feast	for	rats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 turned	 away,	 his	 chest	 still	 heaving,	 and	 slumped	 onto	 a	 bench,	 keeping his	eyes	fixed	on	the	road	behind.	He	half	expected	footsteps,	but	there	was	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">movement,	 no	 torchlight	 searching	 out	 their	 quarry.	 Why	 hadn’t	 they	 followed him?	 Wasn’t	 it	 obvious	 he	 would	 head	 this	 way,	 making	 for	 the	 castle?	 His thighs	 were	 burning	 from	 the	 exertion	 of	 jogging	 the	 short	 distance	 from	 the town	quay.	He	had	kept	to	side	streets	as	much	as	possible.	Either	he	had	given</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	men	from	the	hospital	the	slip,	or	else	they	had	decided	it	no	longer	mattered</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether	 he	 lived	 or	 died.	 He	 had	 served	 his	 purpose	 and	 sooner	 or	 later	 they would	have	killed	him,	of	that	he	had	little	doubt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	 was	 just	 getting	 his	 breath	 back	 when	 he	 spotted	 something	 unusual, tucked	 behind	 a	 boat	 trailer.	 Half-buried	 beneath	 nautical	 paraphernalia,	 race buoys	 and	 coiled	 polypropylene	 rope	 were	 the	 handlebars	 of	 a	 bicycle.	 He debated	whether	it	was	worth	burning	time	trying	to	free	his	hands	or	continue</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 three	 long	 minutes,	 half	 crouching,	 he	 gyrated	 his	 whole	 body	 up	 and down,	rubbing	his	wrists	against	the	rusted	metal	edge	of	the	trailer.	The	backs</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 his	 hands	 were	 raw	 from	 the	 friction	 and	 incessant	 scraping,	 but	 eventually</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p183"></a>with	a	final	grimace	and	a	gasp	of	elation,	the	plastic	ties	broke	and	he	pulled	his hands	 free.	 He	 massaged	 his	 shoulders	 and	 biceps,	 manipulating	 his	 painful fingers	 to	 restore	 full	 circulation.	 He	 levered	 the	 trailer	 upright,	 dragged	 the bicycle	out	from	its	hiding	place,	and	let	the	trailer	crash	down	again.	He	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	 half	 expecting	 to	 see	 a	 dozen	 men	 racing	 his	 way.	 Other	 than	 the rhythmic	 percussion	 of	 a	 hundred	 sets	 of	 rigging	 tapping	 against	 masts	 in	 the marina,	there	was	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	mountain	bike	was	in	poor	condition	with	two	flat	tyres,	a	rusting	frame</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	missing	its	saddle.	Someone	had	discarded	the	bike	here	with	good	reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	swung	his	leg	over	and	tested	the	pedals.	The	chain	squeaked	round,	crying</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	for	some	lubrication.	The	brake	pads	had	either	perished	or	were	missing,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t	 tell	 in	 the	 darkness.	 Compared	 to	 running	 another	 ten	 kilometres,	 the bike	was	better	than	nothing,	but	only	just. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pushed	off,	wobbling	unevenly	down	the	tarmac	surface	before	picking	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">speed	 and	 gaining	 some	 improved	 stability.	 He	 didn’t	 risk	 going	 through	 the gears	and	peddled	slowly	on	the	rims	at	little	more	than	walking	pace.	Passing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 last	 of	 the	 boats	 in	 their	 cradles,	 beached	 like	 whales	 stranded	 by	 a	 falling tide,	he	left	the	boatyard.	He	manoeuvred	the	bike	through	a	kissing	gate,	lifting</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 back	 wheel	 through.	 Beyond,	 the	 asphalt	 path	 stretched	 out	 ahead	 of	 him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moonlight	reflected	off	the	Lymington	river’s	undulating	surface. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 picked	 up	 his	 speed	 a	 little	 and	 quickly	 lost	 control,	 veering	 to	 the	 right down	the	bank	and	ending	up	in	a	watery	ditch.	He	picked	himself	up,	relieved</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	be	uninjured,	his	left	side	coated	with	what	felt	like	mud	but	smelled	worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fetid	water	reeked	of	methane	and	sewage.	He	wheeled	the	bike	back	up	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bank,	and	noticed	the	chain	was	hanging	loose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alone	in	the	darkness,	he	shouted	obscenities	into	the	night,	startling	a	pair	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">birds	 nesting	 in	 the	 gorse	 and	 bushes	 below.	 He	 wasted	 a	 couple	 of	 minutes trying	 to	 get	 the	 chain	 back	 on,	 feeling	 the	 teeth	 of	 the	 gear	 wheels	 with	 his fingers.	 He	 tried	 to	 relocate	 the	 chain	 manually,	 but	 each	 time	 the	 tension	 was too	loose.	He	tried	one	last	time,	kneeling	down,	spinning	the	back	wheel	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	chain	could	come	loose	again.	With	a	sigh	of	relief,	he	straddled	the	frame, </p>
<p class="calibre1">standing	high	on	the	pedals	and	pushed	off	once	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 footpath	 meandered	 across	 the	 mudflats,	 jagging	 left	 away	 from	 Hurst</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	looping	round	across	a	small	tidal	lock	with	a	gate	at	each	end.	He	caught</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	first	sight	of	the	castle	in	the	distance.	He	was	still	some	way	away,	perhaps</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	far	as	five	kilometres.	It	looked	like	a	slumbering	dragon,	belching	smoke	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 night.	 Will	 picked	 up	 the	 pace	 again,	 making	 sure	 to	 stick	 to	 the	 middle	 of the	path,	his	confidence	growing	now	he	had	the	measure	of	the	bike,	albeit	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	flat	tyres. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p184"></a>Where	 the	 footpath	 eventually	 rejoined	 a	 narrow	 single-lane	 road	 at Keyhaven,	 he	 recognised	 the	 small	 quay,	 low	 buildings	 of	 the	 sailing	 club	 and car	 park	 beyond.	 Keeping	 the	 water	 on	 his	 left-hand	 side,	 he	 cycled	 down	 the lane	 nearest	 the	 salt	 marshes	 that	 led	 out	 towards	 Hurst	 Spit	 and	 the	 tidal	 road that	 flooded	 in	 spring	 tides.	 The	 roadway	 was	 littered	 with	 seaweed	 and	 other detritus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bicycle	would	be	useless	on	shingle	so	he	dumped	it	in	a	bush	near	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">footbridge	just	in	case	he	needed	it	again.	He	started	running,	his	feet	slipping	on the	loose	pebbles,	reducing	his	progress	to	a	fast	walk.	In	the	distance,	he	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	the	castle.	He	was	so	close	now.	In	no	more	than	a	mile	he	would	see	his	old</p>
<p class="calibre1">friends	and	be	able	to	warn	them,	providing	he	was	not	already	too	late. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It	was	Tommy’s	turn	to	patrol	the	perimeter.	He	took	a	leisurely	stroll	around	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">and	 Cowes,	 scanning	 for	 any	 lights	 in	 the	 darkness.	 The	 channel	 buoys	 were mostly	 still	 lit.	 Others	 without	 solar	 panels	 had	 long	 since	 gone	 dark,	 though with	the	wind	in	the	right	direction	the	bells	of	some	of	the	cardinal	buoys	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	be	heard,	clanging	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 now	 almost	 two	 years	 since	 the	 last	 ship	 had	 arrived	 here.	 A	 coastal steamer,	 seen	 creeping	 in	 under	 cover	 of	 darkness	 through	 the	 deep-water</p>

<p class="calibre1">what	had	happened	to	them.	Being	on	a	ship,	like	the	 <i class="calibre4">Maersk	Charlotte</i>,	sounded like	 the	 best	 place	 to	 wait	 out	 the	 virus,	 heavily	 laden,	 as	 she	 was,	 with	 stores and	 food.

The	  <i class="calibre4">Charlotte</i>	 had	 been	 anchored near	 the	 Brambles	 bank	 in	 Southampton	 Water	 for	 as	 long	 as	 anyone	 could remember,	 waiting	 to	 unload.

<p class="calibre1">The	 Solent	 had	 once	 been	 one	 of	 the	 busiest	 waterways	 of	 the	 world.	 A</p>

<p class="calibre1">motor	 boats,	 gin	 palaces,	 sailing	 vessels	 of	 every	 description	 had	 graced	 the Solent.	 Ferries	 transporting	 day-trippers	 to	 the	 island,	 packed	 with	 foot</p>

<p class="calibre1">he'd	been	drinking,	long	past	its	sell-by	date. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walking	 back	 along	 the	 length	 of	 the	 southern	 wall,	 he	 headed	 over	 to	 the gateway	to	the	central	courtyard	of	the	original	Tudor	fort	and	the	imposing	gun</p>
<p class="calibre1">tower	at	its	heart	that	looked	out	over	the	whole	castle	complex.	This	inner	part</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	castle	was	kept	locked	after	hours.	He	took	a	minute	to	find	the	oversized</p>
<p class="calibre1">key	 with	 ornate	 ironwork	 and	 engraving	 the	 length	 of	 its	 shaft.	 The	 lock	 was original	and	for	a	moment	he	imagined	himself	as	a	Tudor	guard	dressed	rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">differently	 in	 chainmail,	 holding	 a	 lantern,	 opening	 the	 same	 door,	 making	 the same	midnight	patrol	in	service	of	the	king. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	half	of	the	door	swung	open	and	he	stepped	inside,	sliding	the	heavy	bolt</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	 place.	 Crossing	 the	 stone-paved	 inner	 courtyard	 he	 climbed	 the	 outside staircase	 that	 curved	 around	 the	 main	 building	 till	 he	 reached	 the	 first-floor entrance	to	the	main	living	area.	Inside	the	twelve-sided	walls	of	the	tower	it	was cramped	 and	 dark,	 packed	 with	 sleeping	 bodies	 and	 stores.	 The	 doorway	 had once	 been	 a	 first-floor	 Tudor	 window,	 but	 Scottie	 said	 the	 internal	 spiral staircase	had	been	adapted	during	the	reign	of	Queen	Victoria	to	act	as	a	conduit</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	light	for	the	lower	level. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 silently	 as	 possible	 Tommy	 lifted	 the	 latch	 back	 into	 place	 to	 avoid waking	the	pair	nearest	the	entrance.	Treading	lightly	around	a	row	of	camp	beds</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	sleeping	bags,	he	headed	up	the	stairs	to	a	flat	roof.	Pushing	open	the	half-</p>
<p class="calibre1">size	hatchway,	he	crawled	out	on	his	hands	and	knees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	loved	it	up	here.	The	three-hundred-and-sixty-degree	panoramic	views	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 Solent	 were	 unparalleled.	 Even	 in	 the	 darkness,	 the	 sense	 of	 space	 was intoxicating.	 He	 closed	 his	 eyes	 and	 breathed	 in	 deeply,	 savouring	 the	 salt	 and seaweed	 in	 the	 air.	 It	 was	 an	 overcast	 and	 virtually	 moonless	 night.	 The	 strong breeze	 ruffled	 his	 hair	 and	 made	 him	 shiver	 slightly.	 He	 could	 hear	 waves breaking	 against	 the	 groynes	 and	 rocks	 below,	 pebbles	 scraping	 and	 sliding	 in sync	with	the	pull	of	each	receding	wave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Was	it	his	imagination	or	was	there	also	something	else?	He	thought	he	heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 voice	 and	 then	 a	 metallic	 sound	 that	 seemed	 out	 of	 place,	 coming	 from	 just outside	the	castle	walls.	He	was	convinced	his	mind	was	playing	tricks	on	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	so	many	sleeping	under	canvas	in	the	castle	grounds,	it	was	likely	someone</p>
<p class="calibre1">sleep-talking	 or	 knocking	 something	 over.	 With	 a	 shake	 of	 his	 head,	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">continued	on	with	his	sweep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking	 north	 towards	 Keyhaven,	 he	 could	 make	 out	 the	 line	 of	 moored</p>
<p class="calibre1">yachts	in	the	tidal	estuary.	Silhouetted	shapes	and	masts	swayed	in	the	protected</p>
<p class="calibre1">waters,	their	bows	nodding	gently	towards	him.	All	was	quiet,	as	it	should	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p187"></a>He	yawned	and	was	just	about	to	head	back	down	when	he	heard	a	scrape	of metal	 on	 stone.	 It	 sounded	 like	 an	 anchor	 dragged	 along	 the	 quayside.	 He couldn’t	place	its	source,	but	he	thought	it	came	from	the	direction	of	the	beach</p>
<p class="calibre1">facing	the	Needles	passage.	There	it	was	again,	it	was	like	someone	cutting	fish</p>
<p class="calibre1">heads	on	a	stone	slab.	Was	someone	out	fishing	tonight?	Another	shiver	travelled</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	his	spine,	though	he	was	no	longer	cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	hurried	over	to	the	parapet	but	saw	nothing	out	of	place.	He	realised	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	a	blind	spot	beneath	him	where	he	suspected	the	noise	had	come	from.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">shrugged	 his	 shoulders,	 blaming	 an	 overactive	 imagination.	 He	 should	 never have	 drunk	 that	 last	 beer.	 He	 needed	 to	 get	 a	 grip	 and	 head	 back	 to	 the	 gate, before	he	weirded	himself	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 thought	 he	 heard	 the	 sound	 again,	 convinced	 he	 could	 see	 movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First,	a	pair	of	hands	broke	the	straight	line	of	the	wall’s	edge,	followed	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">head	 and	 shoulders	 of	 a	 figure	 clambering	 over	 the	 wall.	 For	 a	 moment,	 the figure	 lay	 prone,	 turning	 its	 head	 slowly	 while	 it	 got	 its	 bearings.	 As	 Tommy looked	on,	pinching	himself	in	disbelief,	another	figure	clambered	over	the	lip	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	wall	and	joined	the	first,	lying	flat,	waiting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 froze,	 unsure	 what	 to	 do	 next.	 If	 he	 moved,	 they’d	 see	 him.	 In	 his rucksack	slung	across	his	back,	he	had	a	flare	gun	and	a	pistol	with	two	loaded</p>
<p class="calibre1">clips.	Very	slowly,	he	sunk	down	behind	the	parapet,	hoping	that	they	were	too</p>
<p class="calibre1">occupied	to	notice	him.	He	rummaged	through	the	bag	and	found	what	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking	for.	He	cocked	open	the	flare	gun,	checked	there	was	a	cartridge	loaded, </p>
<p class="calibre1">released	the	safety,	pointed	it	high	above	his	head	and	fired. </p><p class="calibre1">

On	the	shingle	beach,	making	slow	progress	towards	Hurst,	hands	on	hips,	Will<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">was	spent.	He	had	hardly	eaten	today,	other	than	the	apple	smuggled	out	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 had	 been	 barely	 enough	 food	 at	 the	 pub	 for	 such	 a	 large	 host,	 and	 the unplanned	extra	night’s	stay	at	the	Ship	Inn	had	exhausted	the	landlord’s	meagre</p>

<p class="calibre1">A	 red	 light	 soared	 above	 Hurst	 and	 exploded	 in	 the	 night	 sky,	 bathing	 the whole	of	the	castle	and	its	surroundings	in	an	orange	glow.	Will	froze,	watching</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p188"></a>approaching	the	small	jetty	behind	the	castle.	It	looked	like	he	was	already	too late.	The	attack	on	Hurst	had	begun. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In	the	guardhouse	by	the	main	gate,	Scottie	heard	the	pop	of	the	flare.	He	sat	bolt upright,	dropped	the	book	he	was	reading	and	threw	his	glasses	on	to	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 grabbed	 the	 large	 handbell	 from	 its	 place	 on	 a	 bookshelf	 and	 scrambled through	 the	 doorway,	 peering	 up	 at	 the	 orange	 glow	 as	 the	 small	 blur	 of	 light blazed	in	the	sky	above	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scottie’s	first	thought	was	that	this	had	to	be	one	of	Tommy’s	practical	jokes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 the	 kind	 of	 stunt	 that	 Tommy	 was	 notorious	 for,	 but	 surely	 even	 he wouldn’t	go	this	far,	would	he?	He	dithered	for	a	few	precious	seconds,	suddenly</p>
<p class="calibre1">unsure	whether	it	was	a	false	alarm	or	a	real	emergency.	He	found	it	difficult	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagine	what	could	possibly	be	worth	waking	the	whole	camp	for	in	the	dead	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scottie	was	still	gawping	up	into	the	night	sky,	wide-eyed,	adrenaline	pulsing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">when	 he	 heard	 shouting	 from	 up	 high.	 Suddenly	 gripped	 by	 a	 very	 real	 fear, Scottie	started	ringing	the	bell	as	loudly	as	he	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	around	Hurst,	men,	women	and	children	were	roused	from	their	slumber. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shaken	 awake	 and	 turfed	 out	 of	 their	 beds	 by	 the	 prospect	 of	 an	 imminent though	 unknown	 threat.	 To	 Scottie,	 it	 sounded	 like	 a	 village	 coming	 to	 life	 at once,	 voices	 and	 noises	 in	 the	 darkness.	 He	 grabbed	 the	 rifle	 and	 stood	 alone, alert	and	waiting,	scanning	the	battlements,	watching	the	flare	as	it	drifted	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 head	 towards	 Keyhaven,	 casting	 long	 shadows	 in	 the	 eerie	 silence	 that followed.	 What	 could	 have	 spooked	 Tommy?	 He	 rocked	 backwards	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">forwards	on	his	heels,	looking	around	him,	puzzled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	rifle	crack	splintered	the	stone	close	to	his	head,	and	his	right	ear	seemed	to</p>

<p class="calibre1">down,	 manoeuvring	 himself	 back	 behind	 the	 doorway	 to	 the	 guardhouse.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">bell	 was	 still	 in	 his	 right	 hand	 and	 he	 started	 ringing	 it	 again	 as	 loudly	 as possible.	 He	 clasped	 a	 pocket	 handkerchief	 to	 his	 ear,	 trying	 to	 staunch	 the steady	flow	of	blood.	Who	the	hell	was	firing	at	him? </p><p class="calibre1">

Back	on	the	Gun	Tower,	Tommy	was	still	cowering	behind	the	parapet,	watching<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">the	flare	drift	on	the	wind.	He	steeled	himself,	trying	to	get	a	grip	on	the	surging</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p190"></a>panic	 threatening	 to	 get	 the	 better	 of	 him.	 His	 heart	 was	 pounding	 so	 fast	 he thought	he	might	be	having	an	asthma	attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	poked	his	head	over	the	ledge,	trying	to	get	a	look	at	what	was	going	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">beneath	him.	A	short	burst	of	automatic	fire	made	him	duck	down	again.	Bullets</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	to	ricochet	off	the	lip	of	the	wall,	showering	him	in	stone	fragments	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">dust.	 He	 moved	 to	 his	 right	 and	 tried	 again.	 This	 time	 he	 got	 a	 clear	 view	 of three	 men,	 edging	 slowly	 across	 the	 roof	 towards	 the	 courtyard	 and	 front	 gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	man	took	up	position	behind	a	chimney,	getting	ready	to	provide	covering</p>
<p class="calibre1">fire.	 A	 silhouetted	 figure	 took	 the	 strain	 on	 a	 rope,	 while	 another	 abseiled	 the short	distance	to	ground	level. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Out	in	the	western	wing	of	the	complex,	he	could	see	a	small	crowd	of	people</p>
<p class="calibre1">pointing	 at	 the	 men	 on	 top	 of	 the	 wall.	 Tommy	 shouted	 at	 them,	 realising	 the danger.	For	a	moment,	the	intruder	was	clearly	visible	by	the	fading	light	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">flare.	He	turned	and	brought	his	weapon	to	bear,	aiming	squarely	at	the	group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 heavy-set	 man	 emerged	 from	 a	 doorway,	 gesticulating	 at	 the	 man	 on	 the roof.	A	short	deafening	burst	split	the	air.	The	first	salvo	downed	the	man	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	gunman	moved	on	to	his	next	target.	He	fired	indiscriminately	now.	Standing</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 open,	 they	 were	 like	 fish	 in	 a	 barrel.	 Tommy’s	 warnings	 were	 lost	 as	 a second	gunman	began	firing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	 suddenly	 snapped	 inside	 Tommy,	 an	 anger	 he	 had	 not	 felt	 since</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 father	 died.	 This	 time	 was	 different.	 There	 was	 a	 channel,	 an	 outlet	 for	 his rage.	 Whoever	 these	 men	 were,	 they	 would	 pay	 for	 what	 they	 had	 done.	 He shook	 his	 head	 and	 tried	 to	 blink	 away	 the	 last	 traces	 of	 alcohol	 still	 coursing through	his	veins.	Perhaps	it	would	give	him	the	Dutch	courage	he	needed. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
Tommy	hurried	down	the	stairs	to	join	Nathan	and	Liz	who	were	assembling	a<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">motley	 group	 of	 volunteers.	 One	 man	 wore	 no	 shoes,	 another	 looked	 half-</p>
<p class="calibre1">dressed.	 Despite	 their	 training,	 they	 all	 looked	 terrified.	 Everyone	 looked	 at Tommy	 as	 if	 the	 rifle	 lent	 him	 some	 authority.	 With	 Jack	 and	 Terra	 away,	 and Zed	and	Riley	still	not	back,	it	was	up	to	them	to	rally	the	defence	of	the	castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 cleared	 his	 throat	 and	 stepped	 forward,	 his	 voice	 breathless	 and	 full	 of emotion.	Inside,	he	was	fighting	to	control	the	fear	which	gripped	his	chest	like	a vice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen	 up.”	 His	 voice	 sounded	 weird	 in	 his	 head,	 like	 it	 was	 coming	 from someone	else.	His	father’s	voice.	“We	don’t	have	much	time.	I	saw	four	men,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	could	be	others.	We	have	no	idea	how	many	are	already	inside	the	castle</p>
<p class="calibre1">walls	and	how	many	of	them	could	be	waiting	outside.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p191"></a>Nathan	 took	 over	 from	 Tommy,	 his	 voice	 trembling.	 “Jamie	 and	 the	 rest	 of you	with	rifles,	get	back	up	on	the	roof	and	give	us	covering	fire.	We’ve	got	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">stop	them	reaching	the	main	gate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nathan	 handed	 out	 the	 few	 remaining	 guns	 to	 the	 volunteers,	 together	 with the	knives,	swords	and	a	medieval	crossbow	with	a	single	bolt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Greta	stood	ready	by	the	locked	door	to	the	courtyard.	She	drew	back	the	bolt</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 quietly	 as	 she	 dared.	 Nathan’s	 party	 of	 five	 sized	 each	 other	 up	 with	 gritted teeth,	 trying	 to	 hide	 their	 terror.	 None	 of	 them	 were	 fighters	 but	 they	 had	 no choice.	 This	 was	 tantamount	 to	 suicide.	 They	 didn’t	 stand	 a	 chance.	 Tommy noticed	a	wet	patch	appear	on	the	crotch	of	the	man	next	to	him.	His	hand	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">shaking	uncontrollably,	as	a	large	puddle	pooled	next	to	his	left	boot.	He	patted</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	man	on	the	shoulder	before	racing	up	the	stairs	to	join	Jamie	on	the	roof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	Tommy	was	in	position,	he	shouted	to	the	party	below.	On	the	count	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">three,	Greta	unlocked	the	gate	and	the	five	of	them	jostled	through	the	doorway, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with	two	shotguns	at	their	head.	Greta	slammed	the	door	behind	them	and	closed</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	eyes,	saying	a	silent	prayer.	Nathan’s	team	made	a	dash	for	the	guardhouse</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	Scottie	was	waving	them	forward.	He	had	taken	up	position	with	a	rifle, </p>
<p class="calibre1">taking	pot	shots	at	the	two	men	on	the	roof	as	they	advanced	along	the	rooftop</p>
<p class="calibre1">towards	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 Nathan’s	 group	 surged	 forward,	 a	 hail	 of	 bullets	 felled	 two	 of	 the	 Hurst men	in	quick	succession.	One	man	took	a	shot	to	the	leg,	passing	clean	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	calf	and	the	other	went	down	clutching	his	abdomen.	The	rest	of	the	group</p>
<p class="calibre1">promptly	 lost	 their	 nerve	 and	 turned	 tail,	 retreating	 to	 the	 safety	 of	 the	 Tudor archway.	 With	 their	 fists,	 they	 banged	 impotently	 for	 Greta	 to	 let	 them	 back inside.	For	a	few	moments,	they	were	trapped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	and	the	other	Hurst	riflemen	on	the	roof	couldn’t	get	an	angle	of	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	exposing	themselves	to	a	volley	of	return	fire,	no	one	had	a	clean	shot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hidden	 out	 of	 sight	 with	 a	 field	 of	 fire	 covering	 the	 courtyard	 and	 entrance, Copper’s	men	had	Scottie	pinned	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	looked	on	helplessly.	Two	of	Nathan’s	men	writhed	in	agony	just	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 reach.	 Each	 time	 one	 of	 them	 reached	 forward	 to	 try	 to	 pull	 the	 others	 to safety,	the	ground	between	them	seemed	to	explode	with	bullets.	From	round	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">corner,	in	the	archway	leading	to	the	main	entrance,	Tommy	could	hear	Scottie</p>
<p class="calibre1">shouting	for	help.	For	a	few	seconds,	each	side	waited	for	the	other	to	make	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">next	move. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
From	behind	a	 buttress,	Scottie	took	 up	a	kneeling	 position,	firing	sporadically<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p192"></a>towards	 the	 men	 on	 the	 roof	 opposite.	 He	 didn’t	 have	 a	 shot	 and	 was	 running low	on	ammunition.	There	was	still	no	sign	of	reinforcements.	Behind	him	came</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	sound	of	a	rifle	butt	smashing	against	the	raised	drawbridge.	He	smiled	for	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">split	second,	knowing	it	would	take	a	battering	ram. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 whipped	 his	 head	 round	 as	 a	 smoke	 canister	 landed	 just	 in	 front	 of	 his position,	swiftly	followed	by	a	second.	With	a	loud	pop	and	a	hiss,	smoke	began</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	fill	the	courtyard.	In	a	few	seconds,	his	whole	field	of	vision	was	shrouded	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">billowing	clouds	of	choking,	cloying	gas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	of	Copper’s	men	shimmied	down	a	rope	from	above	and	emerged	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">cover,	advancing	towards	Scottie	wearing	gas	masks.	Without	a	clear	target,	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">fired	 controlled	 bursts	 at	 shapes	 and	 shadows.	 Unable	 to	 see	 anything,	 Scottie peered	 into	 the	 cloud.	 As	 the	 smoke	 swirled	 towards	 his	 position,	 he	 stifled	 a cough.	The	smoke	completely	enveloped	the	Tudor	gate,	rendering	Tommy	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	others	blind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scottie	took	his	chance.	Unseen	by	the	invaders,	he	dived	across	the	archway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scrambling	 through	 the	 open	 doorway	 to	 the	 guardhouse,	 he	 slammed	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">locked	 the	 door	 behind	 him.	 He	 was	 safe	 for	 the	 time	 being,	 but	 had	 just	 cut himself	off	from	the	rest	of	the	Hurst	group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile,	Nathan	must	have	seen	or	heard	the	invaders	advancing	towards</p>
<p class="calibre1">him,	hammering	on	the	door	until	Greta	let	them	back	through.	They	collapsed</p>
<p class="calibre1">inside,	 coughing	 and	 spluttering.	 Wisps	 of	 the	 smoke	 dissipated	 slowly	 around them.	 Tommy	 raced	 down	 the	 stairs	 to	 confer	 with	 Nathan.	 They	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">outgunned.	Their	nerves	shredded	by	the	speed	of	their	demise	and	the	ferocity</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	fire	they	had	faced.	Nathan	had	lost	half	his	group	in	a	matter	of	seconds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 battle	 for	 the	 main	 gate	 was	 lost.	 Tommy	 knew	 that	 now.	 And	 yet,	 he consoled	 himself	 with	 the	 fact	 that	 the	 bulk	 of	 Hurst’s	 occupants	 were	 safe	 for now.	Between	them	and	their	attackers	were	stone	walls	from	another	time.	Six</p>
<p class="calibre1">feet	thick	and	built	to	withstand	the	very	worst	the	French	and	Spanish	navies	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">yesteryear	could	hurl	their	way.	Tommy	was	fairly	sure	that	the	castle	could	hold</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	 against	 a	 superior	 force	 for	 many	 days.	 The	 unlucky	 few	 trapped	 on	 the wrong	side	of	the	Tudor	gate	would	have	to	fend	for	themselves.	Unfortunately, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that	included	Scottie. </p><p class="calibre1">

Outside	the	castle	complex,	the	man	in	black	waited	impatiently,	pacing	around. <p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">His	plan	was	working	perfectly,	but	not	knowing	what	was	going	on	inside	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">killing	him.	Why	was	it	taking	Copper	so	long? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 main	 force	 had	 arrived	 unopposed	 in	 the	 small	 harbour	 area.	 They	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p193"></a>silently	approached	the	main	gate,	crossing	what	would	once	have	been	a	moat surrounding	the	original	Tudor	fort.	Today	it	was	little	more	than	a	ditch.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 their	 backs	 pressed	 against	 the	 stone	 walls,	 looking	 up	 nervously	 in	 case there	were	any	sharpshooters	on	the	ramparts	above	them.	They	knew	first-hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	it	paid	to	be	careful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 drawbridge	 was	 still	 raised	 and	 beyond	 the	 formidable	 stone	 and	 wood defences	 they	 were	 listening	 to	 the	 fire	 fight.	 The	 man	 in	 black	 smiled	 and pressed	 his	 cheek	 against	 the	 cold	 of	 the	 stone,	 trying	 to	 interpret	 the	 sounds from	within.	He	seemed	to	be	enjoying	himself	and	started	to	whistle.	When	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard	 the	 pop	 and	 hiss	 of	 the	 smoke	 grenades,	 he	 clicked	 his	 fingers	 and gesticulated	 at	 one	 of	 the	 others	 in	 the	 darkness,	 recognising	 his	 plan	 playing out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	interrogation	of	Will	had	been	decisive.	The	castle	was	indeed	vulnerable</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	would	be	taken	with	minimal	casualties.	Losing	a	few	of	Copper’s	men	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">neither	 here	 nor	 there.	 It	 was	 an	 acceptable	 price	 to	 pay	 for	 this	 jewel	 of	 the Solent.	Hurst	was	to	be	an	important	strategic	pillar	for	his	new	empire. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
Back	 on	 the	 roof	 of	 the	 tower,	 the	 man	 next	 to	 Tommy	 took	 a	 bullet	 to	 the shoulder,	sending	his	rifle	clattering.	Tommy	picked	it	up,	checked	it	was	loaded<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">and	 scanned	 for	 targets.	 The	 smoke	 masking	 the	 movement	 of	 the	 invaders	 as they	fought	their	way	towards	the	gate	parted	suddenly	exposing	a	solitary	figure</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	a	second. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	took	careful	aim,	letting	his	breath	out	slowly	as	Zed	had	taught	him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">before	squeezing	the	trigger.	The	recoil	from	the	rifle	surprised	him	and	he	lost</p>
<p class="calibre1">sight	 of	 the	 figure	 below.	 When	 the	 smoke	 next	 cleared,	 he	 could	 make	 out	 a body	 lying	 prone	 on	 the	 ground,	 then	 the	 smoke	 obscured	 his	 view	 again.	 He punched	 the	 air	 in	 delight	 to	 muted	 congratulations	 from	 the	 man	 next	 to	 him clutching	his	injured	shoulder.	How	many	more	were	there?	Nathan	had	tasked</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	with	stopping	the	men	from	reaching	the	front	gate,	but	with	the	counter-</p>
<p class="calibre1">attack	 over,	 almost	 before	 it	 had	 begun,	 the	 balance	 of	 power	 had	 swung violently	against	them. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
Scottie	could	only	listen	to	the	fire	fight,	wondering	helplessly	what	had	become<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">of	his	friends.	The	door	handle	close	to	his	ear	silently	began	to	turn.	He	heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">whispered	 voices.	 There	 were	 two	 men	 outside.	 Would	 they	 try	 to	 break	 down</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p194"></a>the	 door?	 Or	 would	 they	 leave	 him	 there,	 trapped	 while	 they	 tried	 to	 open	 the drawbridge?	 A	 second	 group	 shouted	 instructions	 from	 outside	 the	 gate.	 He could	 hear	 muffled	 sounds,	 perhaps	 struggling	 with	 the	 release	 mechanism	 for the	 drawbridge.	 Scottie	 smiled,	 remembering	 how	 stiff	 and	 awkward	 it	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">unless	you	knew	how.	The	footsteps	hurried	away	back	to	the	courtyard	and	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">relaxed	 in	 the	 brief	 silence	 that	 followed,	 beginning	 to	 feel	 safe	 behind	 the barricaded	 door,	 jammed	 shut	 with	 a	 heavy	 oak	 desk	 and	 metal	 filing	 cabinet stacked	on	top	of	it.	He	had	his	back	to	the	desk,	ready	to	push	back	if	someone</p>
<p class="calibre1">tried	to	force	their	way	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 silence	 stretched.	 Perhaps	 they	 had	 given	 up.	 Where	 were	 those</p>
<p class="calibre1">reinforcements?	Either	his	friends	had	been	beaten	back	or	they	were	dead.	On</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	own,	stuck	in	the	guardhouse,	there	was	nothing	he	could	do.	He	checked	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">ammunition.	Twelve	more	rounds,	then	he	was	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 searched	 the	 desk,	 looking	 for	 anything	 he	 could	 use,	 but	 the	 drawers were	mostly	full	of	paperwork,	ticket	stubs,	pencils	and	pens.	The	shelves	each</p>
<p class="calibre1">side	of	the	window	were	stacked	with	guidebooks	of	the	castle	and	maps	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">local	area,	together	with	assorted	merchandise	from	when	the	guardhouse	served</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 the	 ticket	 office	 and	 gift	 shop.	 The	 second	 room	 towards	 the	 back	 proved more	 rewarding.	 He	 found	 biscuits	 and	 bottled	 water,	 together	 with	 a	 walkie-talkie	with	working	batteries.	He	turned	the	volume	dial	and	got	a	burst	of	static. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	left	it	on	low	in	case	someone	else	in	the	castle	was	trying	to	contact	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	explosions	a	couple	of	milliseconds	apart	sent	dust	showering	down	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">top	of	him.	The	deafening	noise	echoed	round	the	confined	space.	He	staggered</p>
<p class="calibre1">against	the	wall,	dazed	and	disoriented.	The	ringing	in	his	ears	drowned	out	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	sounds,	including	his	own	cries	of	anguish. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
The	 blast	 from	 the	 two	 charges	 had	 torn	 one	 side	 of	 the	 drawbridge	 from	 its hinges	 and	 its	 wood	 was	 broken	 and	 splintered.	 Copper	 waited	 for	 the	 dust	 to settle.	A	draft	of	wind	through	the	new	opening	slowly	dispersed	the	smoke	from<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">the	explosion.	Scorch	marks	discoloured	the	walls	and	ceiling.	Through	the	blast</p>
<p class="calibre1">hole	clambered	Copper’s	boss,	quickly	followed	by	the	rest	of	his	men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 two	 men	 embraced	 but	 their	 moment	 of	 self-congratulation	 quickly</p>
<p class="calibre1">passed	as	a	bullet	ricocheted	on	the	stone	floor.	Out	of	sight,	in	the	shadows,	the defenders	on	the	roof	of	the	Gun	Tower	were	exchanging	fire	with	the	intruders</p>
<p class="calibre1">below.	A	sniper	had	taken	up	position	behind	a	chimneystack	on	the	roof	of	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	gun	batteries.	In	the	gathering	darkness,	he	was	all	but	invisible,	picking</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	the	Hurst	men	whenever	they	revealed	themselves	above	the	parapet. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p195"></a>Copper’s	team	rounded	the	corner,	staying	close	to	the	wall.	He	attached	the last	remaining	set	of	charges	to	the	inner	gate	leading	to	the	old	Tudor	castle	and the	 eastern	 wing	 beyond,	 where	 the	 bulk	 of	 Hurst’s	 occupants	 were	 now</p>
<p class="calibre1">cowering. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
Inside	the	Tudor	fortress,	Tommy	and	the	others	were	barricading	doorways	and<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">fortifying	 firing	 positions	 with	 anything	 they	 could	 get	 their	 hands	 on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Overturned	beds	and	mattresses	were	dragged	against	windows	overlooking	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">courtyard.	 Tommy	 was	 confident	 that	 if	 the	 invaders	 did	 get	 through	 the	 gate, they	would	be	walking	into	a	kill	zone.	Anything	and	anyone	that	came	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	be	cut	to	shreds.	It	would	be	a	turkey	shoot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	last	of	the	charges	exploded,	the	blast	reverberated	in	the	enclosed</p>
<p class="calibre1">space.	The	deafening	sound	rumbled	throughout	the	Tudor	complex	and	network</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 dark	 tunnels	 and	 chambers	 beneath	 their	 feet.	 For	 a	 few	 long	 seconds following	 the	 explosion,	 nothing	 happened.	 No	 one	 dared	 come	 through	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">doorway.	 Tommy	 and	 the	 others	 stood	 ready,	 guns	 trained	 on	 the	 gap,	 where light	now	streamed	through	from	a	high-powered	torch	or	lantern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	metallic	came	skidding	through	the	doorway,	followed	by	the	now</p>
<p class="calibre1">familiar	pop	and	hiss	of	a	smoke	canister	as	it	came	to	rest	in	the	middle	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">courtyard.	 One	 of	 the	 defenders	 emerged	 from	 the	 shadows	 to	 try	 and	 kick	 the grenade	back	where	it	came	from.	A	hail	of	fire	threw	him	back	against	the	wall</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	he	slid	down,	clutching	a	wound	to	the	chest.	He	disappeared	from	view, </p>
<p class="calibre1">shrouded	in	an	impenetrable	cloud	of	orange	gas	that	began	to	fill	the	courtyard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 cloud	 rose	 inexorably	 towards	 Jamie	 and	 the	 men	 on	 the	 roof	 of	 the	 Gun Tower.	 They	 could	 now	 see	 nothing	 at	 all	 below	 them	 and	 scanned	 for	 any shapes	 or	 movement.	 They	 could	 hear	 footsteps	 and	 one	 man	 fired	 on	 instinct towards	the	source	of	the	noise.	Standing	to	see	if	he’d	hit	anything,	there	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">loud	 crack	 and	 the	 man	 to	 Jamie’s	 right	 went	 down.	 The	 others	 dropped	 lower behind	the	parapet	and	waited.	The	attackers	were	inside	the	Tudor	castle.	There</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	nothing	now	between	them	and	taking	control	of	the	whole	complex.	Only</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Gun	Tower	now	remained	secure. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p196"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Forty-seven</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 fire	 fight	 was	 over.	 For	 a	 few	 minutes,	 there	 was	 an	 eerie	 silence,	 bar	 the cries	for	help	from	the	wounded	on	both	sides.	Tommy	peered	out	the	window</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	the	courtyard	from	behind	a	curtain	in	the	Gun	Tower. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	beyond	the	damaged	gate,	he	heard	a	measured	hand	clap.	One	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">men	below	spoke	in	a	slow	deliberate	voice,	imbued	with	a	calm	authority	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">reminded	Tommy	of	a	high-court	judge	delivering	his	sentence	to	a	condemned</p>
<p class="calibre1">man.	“Bravo,	bravo.	You	have	fought	well.	History	will	remember	your	bravery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 enough	 is	 enough.	 There	 is	 no	 need	 for	 any	 more	 of	 you	 to	 die</p>
<p class="calibre1">unnecessarily.	 Lay	 down	 your	 weapons	 and	 come	 out	 from	 your	 hiding	 places with	your	arms	raised.	This	is	not	a	battle	you	can	win.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	voice	paused,	its	words	echoing	around	the	battlements.	Tommy	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">on,	his	face	hidden,	aware	of	faces	pressed	together	behind	him,	trying	to	get	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">look	at	the	silhouetted	figure	behind	the	disembodied	voice	in	the	darkness.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	over	his	shoulder	and	studied	their	faces.	They	looked	defeated,	the	fight</p>
<p class="calibre1">gone	from	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside,	a	figure	dressed	in	black	emerged	from	the	archway,	marching	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">prisoners	 ahead	 of	 him,	 using	 one	 as	 a	 shield,	 a	 pistol	 held	 to	 the	 side	 of	 his head.	Tommy	recognised	the	human	shield	immediately.	It	was	Jackson,	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 recent	 arrivals.	 Jackson	 stared	 straight	 back	 at	 the	 window	 where	 Tommy was	 hiding	 as	 if	 he	 could	 see	 him	 as	 clear	 as	 day,	 despite	 the	 near	 darkness.	 It chilled	 Tommy	 to	 the	 bone,	 knowing	 that	 they	 would	 have	 to	 choose	 between surrender	and	watching	his	friend	be	executed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	surrender	now,	I	give	you	my	word	that	no	one	else	from	Hurst	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">die	tonight.”	The	speaker’s	sense	of	theatre	was	not	lost	on	others.	He	seemed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	relishing	this	moment	of	drama,	milking	the	tension	on	both	sides,	knowing</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes	were	watching	his	every	move,	wondering	what	he	would	do	next. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 silence.	 Tommy	 stayed	 completely	 still,	 his	 mind	 racing.	 What</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	his	father	have	done	in	this	situation?	A	thought	occurred	to	him	and	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">smiled	in	spite	of	the	circumstances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	 course,	 if	 you	 do	 not	 surrender,	 I	 can	 assure	 you,	 you	 will	 all	 die,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">continued	 the	 voice	 from	 below.	 “Of	 that	 be	 absolutely	 certain.	 Starting	 with these	 two	 right	 here.”	 He	 jabbed	 the	 gun	 in	 Jackson’s	 neck	 and	 kicked	 out	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p197"></a>legs	from	behind	so	that	he	fell	forward	onto	his	hands	and	knees,	gasping	with pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 will	 give	 you	 five	 minutes	 to	 consider	 my	 offer.	 Surrender	 and	 live.	 Or fight	and	die.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 let	 the	 curtain	 fall	 back	 into	 place	 and	 crouched	 down	 below	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">window	 to	 confer	 with	 Nathan,	 their	 backs	 pressed	 against	 the	 wall.	 There seemed	 no	 way	 they	 could	 win	 this	 fight.	 Surrender	 now	 and	 they	 could	 avoid further	bloodshed,	but	could	they	trust	this	man	to	keep	his	word?	What	did	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">want	 anyway?	 To	 seize	 control	 of	 Hurst?	 To	 steal	 their	 food	 and	 supplies?	 Or was	there	some	other	motive? </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	had	put	up	a	good	fight,	Tommy	was	sure	of	that.	Including	the	two	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 killed	 or	 wounded,	 he	 estimated	 at	 least	 ten	 of	 them	 had	 been	 injured,	 but guessed	there	were	at	least	as	many	attackers	again.	All	told,	the	Hurst	defenders</p>
<p class="calibre1">far	 outnumbered	 them,	 but	 were	 poorly	 armed.	 In	 their	 favour,	 however,	 they held	the	high	ground	and	could	pick	off	anyone	who	entered	the	inner	courtyard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	a	bit	of	luck,	they	might	be	able	to	hold	out	here	for	days,	even	weeks	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	food	and	water	they	already	had.	If	they	could	just	get	word	to	their	allies, </p>
<p class="calibre1">then	 perhaps	 they	 could	 survive	 the	 siege	 or	 fight	 their	 way	 out.	 It	 was	 a	 risky move.	If	only	Jack	was	here,	he	would	know	what	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	surveyed	the	faces	of	those	around	him	and	made	up	his	mind.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1">should	play	for	time.	Try	and	reason	with	this	man	holding	Hurst	to	ransom	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">find	out	what	he	wanted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 the	 window	 pushed	 open	 a	 few	 inches,	 Tommy	 called	 out,	 “We</p>
<p class="calibre1">appreciate	the	offer	and	everything.”	He	shook	his	head,	hearing	his	own	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 just	 sounded	 weird.	 Nathan	 patted	 him	 encouragingly	 on	 the	 shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 swallowed	 hard	 before	 continuing.	 “But	 before	 we	 give	 you	 our</p>
<p class="calibre1">response,	we	have	some	questions	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 below	 laughed.	 “Very	 well.	 I	 will	 allow	 you	 three	 questions.	 Use them	wisely.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 closed	 his	 eyes,	 trying	 to	 organise	 his	 thoughts.	 His	 first	 question tripped	out	before	he	could	think	it	through.	“Why	are	you	here?”	He	flinched, </p>
<p class="calibre1">cursing	himself.	It	was	a	dumb	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	 are	 we	 here?”	 he	 repeated	 in	 a	 mocking	 voice,	 mimicking	 Tommy’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">nasal	 twang.	 “Isn’t	 it	 obvious?	 You	 have	 something	 we	 need.	 A	 mutual	 friend told	us	everything.	Need	I	say	more?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	if	you	could	be	a	bit	more	specific,	we	could	come	to	some	kind	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrangement?”	offered	Tommy	tentatively,	beginning	to	relax	a	little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	misunderstand,”	he	replied,	shaking	his	head.	“You	are	in	no	position	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">negotiate.	Hurst	has	a	debt	to	pay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p198"></a>Tommy	 exchanged	 puzzled	 glances	 with	 Nathan,	 who	 was	 mouthing	 the word	“debt”.	What	debt	was	he	talking	about	and	who	was	this	mutual	friend? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps	they	had	captured	Jack	or	Terra	or	even	Zed.	He	opted	to	play	for	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">time,	trying	to	gather	more	pieces	of	the	puzzle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	we	surrender,	what	guarantees	can	you	give	us	that	we	will	be	allowed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">leave	here	in	peace?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 word	 is	 my	 bond.”	 He	 clapped	 his	 right	 hand	 to	 his	 heart</p>
<p class="calibre1">sanctimoniously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	mentioned	a	debt.	What	debt?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	 men	 attacked	 us,	 killed	 my	 men.	 You	 took	 something	 that	 does	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1">belong	to	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	know	nothing	about	an	attack.	I’m	telling	you,	it	wasn’t	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 wagged	 his	 finger.	 “You’ve	 had	 your	 three	 questions.	 I	 need	 your decision.	Do	I	have	your	surrender?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	paused,	remembering	the	many	nights	they	had	played	poker.	“Play</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 man	 opposite	 you,”	 Jack	 would	 say.	 It	 didn’t	 matter	 if	 you	 held	 a	 pair	 of twos.	Tommy	took	a	deep	breath	and	gambled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	suggest	you	look	around	you.	You’re	outnumbered.	Whoever	your	mutual</p>
<p class="calibre1">friend	is,	they	did	not	tell	you	the	whole	truth.	Your	men	have	walked	into	a	trap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Below	 your	 feet	 is	 a	 network	 of	 tunnels.	 Right	 now,	 a	 small	 army	 is	 readying itself	to	fight.	You	caught	us	cold	once,	but	it	won’t	happen	again.	Last	chance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leave	now.	What	debt	could	possibly	be	worth	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	knew	what	was	taken…”	He	paused.	“You’re	bluffing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wouldn’t	count	on	it.	Why	don’t	you	tell	us	what	you	want	and	maybe	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	come	to	an	arrangement.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	in	black	laughed.	“I’m	growing	tired	of	your	childish	games.	Either</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re	 playing	 a	 very	 dangerous	 game,	 or	 you	 really	 have	 no	 idea	 what	 your men	did.”	He	looked	at	his	feet	and	the	hostage	on	his	knees,	a	gun	still	pressed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	side	of	his	head.	“Very	well.	Your	group	broke	into	the	hospital	and	took</p>
<p class="calibre1">two	 patients,	 Adele	 and	 Stella.	 We	 need	 them	 back.	 They’re	 sick	 and	 need treatment.	 There,	 I’ve	 told	 you	 more	 than	 enough.	 Return	 them	 to	 us</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediately	and	we	will	spare	the	rest	of	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	looked	around	the	group	and	saw	only	blank	expressions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	no	one	by	those	names	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	that	case,	you	have	nothing	left	to	bargain	with.	If	you	refuse	to	surrender, </p>
<p class="calibre1">then	you	will	face	the	consequences.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	silence	that	followed,	Tommy	and	Nathan	conferred	quietly	and	passed</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	message	up	the	stairs	to	Jamie	on	the	rooftop.	They	had	a	surprise	or	two	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	sleeve. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p199"></a>Two	rifle	shots	shattered	the	silence.	Jackson	was	hit	in	the	shoulder	and	the other	prisoner	in	the	leg.	Both	men	collapsed	and	lay	gasping	on	the	ground.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	 in	 black	 stepped	 back,	 suddenly	 exposed,	 his	 cheek	 splattered	 with	 blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Calmly,	 he	 took	 a	 handkerchief	 from	 a	 breast	 pocket,	 shook	 it	 open	 and	 wiped the	spots	away,	inspecting	the	stains. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 take	 it	 that’s	 a	 no	 then.	 On	 your	 head	 be	 it.”	 Shaking	 his	 head	 in disappointment,	 he	 slowly	 walked	 backwards	 out	 of	 the	 gate,	 lingering	 for	 a second	to	stare	up	at	Tommy	before	disappearing	out	of	sight. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
In	the	outer	courtyard,	near	the	main	gate,	Copper	had	rounded	up	half	a	dozen<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">prisoners,	 faces	 pressed	 against	 the	 brick	 wall.	 They	 were	 shoeless,	 unarmed, defenceless,	at	the	mercy	of	their	captors.	Several	of	the	women	were	sobbing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pleading	for	their	lives.	Copper	looked	away,	avoiding	eye	contact,	forcing	their</p>

<p class="calibre1">His	 boss	 walked	 down	 the	 line,	 studying	 their	 faces	 without	 a	 flicker	 of empathy.	“Kill	them	all,”	he	commanded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Copper	 heard	 the	 order	 but	 delayed	 a	 few	 seconds,	 remaining	 rooted	 to	 the spot.	 He	 processed	 the	 words	 but	 a	 shadow	 of	 his	 former	 self	 seemed	 to	 reject them	 as	 nonsensical.	 Since	 when	 had	 he	 grown	 a	 conscience?	 The	 moment	 of doubt	passed.	Copper	nodded	and	relayed	the	order	to	his	men,	his	face	calm	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">emotionless.	 They	 raised	 their	 weapons	 and	 fired	 until	 their	 magazines	 were empty	and	no	one	was	left	standing,	bodies	jerking	and	twitching	on	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Copper	turned	his	head	towards	the	man	in	black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	the	rest	of	them?	What	are	your	orders,	sir?”	asked	Copper,	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">unusual	edge	to	his	deference. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Burn	it	down.	Smoke	them	out,	those	little	piglets	in	their	house	of	stone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.”	Copper	gathered	up	a	work	party	and	set	off	to	the	campfire	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">smouldering	in	the	distance.	They	grabbed	firewood	and	piled	it	high	inside	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">canteen,	 storerooms	 and	 living	 quarters	 that	 lined	 the	 castle	 walls	 and	 set	 them alight.	In	a	few	minutes	the	whole	place	went	up	like	a	tinderbox. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p200"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Forty-eight</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	 supported	 Jack	 the	 last	 few	 yards	 from	 Osborne	 House	 through	 the	 long grass	to	the	helicopter	as	its	engines	went	into	their	start-up	cycle	and	the	rotors began	 to	 turn.	 The	 airmen	 hauled	 the	 wounded	 man	 through,	 laid	 him	 flat	 and strapped	 his	 legs	 and	 torso	 down	 tight,	 before	 taking	 a	 pair	 of	 surgical	 scissors and	 cutting	 the	 material	 of	 his	 blue	 woollen	 jumper,	 exposing	 the	 injury	 to	 his shoulder.	 He	 made	 Jack	 comfortable	 for	 the	 journey,	 setting	 up	 a	 drip	 and stabilising	the	wound	before	take-off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 painkillers	 were	 numbing	 his	 senses	 but	 he	 noticed	 Sam	 was	 in	 some</p>
<p class="calibre1">distress.	 He	 guessed	 he	 was	 still	 thinking	 about	 Terra	 and	 what	 could	 have happened	 to	 her.	 She	 was	 like	 a	 mother	 to	 Sam.	 The	 American	 had	 said	 they would	 take	 her	 back	 to	 a	 convict	 camp	 near	 Newport,	 but	 how	 did	 they	 really know? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	was	shown	to	a	jump	seat	just	behind	the	pilot,	facing	backwards.	When</p>
<p class="calibre1">Peterson	 and	 the	 two	 other	 navy	 personnel	 were	 safely	 inside,	 the	 airman	 gave the	nod	and	the	two	Seal	team	members	who	had	been	covering	the	aircraft	left</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	kneeling	positions	and	double-timed	it	to	the	aircraft,	clipped	into	the	safety harnesses	and	sat	on	the	floor	sill,	their	feet	dangling	free,	weapons	poised	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">ready.	Peterson	handed	Jack	what	looked	like	a	large	pair	of	headphones	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">microphone	attached.	He	weighed	the	headset,	turning	it	over	in	his	hands	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">putting	 it	 on.	 The	 cabin	 was	 suddenly	 silent,	 the	 noise	 of	 the	 engine	 almost eliminated	and	he	could	hear	Peterson	talking	to	the	pilot,	relaying	a	message	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 <i class="calibre4">Chester</i>	with	an	update	on	their	status	and	due	warning	that	they	would	be	on deck	in	less	than	fifteen	minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 helicopter,	 a	 MH-60R	 Seahawk,	 achieved	 full	 power	 and	 with	 a	 gentle</p>
<p class="calibre1">tug	on	the	stick	lifted	off	into	the	night	sky.	Its	navigation	lights	remained	off	as it	banked	round	a	few	metres	above	the	tree	tops,	staying	low,	following	the	river</p>
<p class="calibre1">valley	that	led	straight	downhill	back	to	the	open	water	of	the	Solent.	Peterson</p>
<p class="calibre1">spoke	 rapidly	 into	 the	 radio,	 though	 the	 military	 jargon	 was	 hard	 to	 follow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside	it	was	pitch	black.	Jack	craned	his	neck	to	peer	out	of	the	right	side	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 aircraft.	 The	 pilot’s	 night-vision	 goggles	 allowed	 him	 to	 see	 in	 complete darkness.	Jack	could	just	make	out	treetops	and	the	sweep	of	fields	and	farmland</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	they	headed	back	out	to	sea. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p201"></a>Flying	 low,	 they	 banked	 left	 when	 they	 were	 over	 water.	 In	 the	 distance towards	the	mainland,	they	could	just	make	out	the	oil	refinery	at	Fawley	bathed</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 orange	 light	 from	 billowing	 flames	 that	 leapt	 unchecked	 into	 the	 night	 sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Further	 to	 the	 west,	 two	 tower	 blocks	 in	 the	 city	 of	 Southampton	 smouldered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 inferno	 that	 had	 engulfed	 them	 had	 moved	 on,	 spreading	 slowly	 across housing	estates	and	residential	areas,	fanned	by	the	night’s	breeze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Below	 them,	 in	 the	 lee	 of	 the	 land,	 the	 sea	 state	 was	 relatively	 calm,	 but further	 out	 Jack	 could	 make	 out	 white	 horses	 as	 the	 waves	 rose	 and	 fell,	 their crests	foaming	and	breaking	in	the	wind.	The	helicopter	hugged	the	coastline	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 island,	 accelerating	 as	 it	 turned	 west	 towards	 Yarmouth	 and	 Hurst	 Castle, before	 heading	 south-west	 into	 Christchurch	 Bay	 where	 the	  <i class="calibre4">USS	 Chester</i>	 was cruising	towards	them	at	impulse	power.	As	they	flew	towards	the	western	end</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	island,	Peterson’s	voice	came	over	the	headset. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jack,	you	better	take	a	look	at	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 unclipped	 his	 safety	 harness	 and	 levered	 himself	 up	 to	 look	 out	 of	 the cockpit	window,	clinging	on	tight	as	the	aircraft	lurched	violently.	Out	in	front	of them,	 he	 saw	 suddenly	 what	 Peterson	 was	 worried	 about.	 In	 the	 distance,	 they could	make	out	the	sweep	of	the	shingle	spit	that	joined	Hurst	to	the	mainland, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	castle	at	its	eastern	tip.	Part	of	the	castle	was	ablaze,	flames	leaping	up above	the	walls	and	parapet.	Jack	couldn’t	believe	what	he	was	seeing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pleaded	with	Peterson	to	slow	down	and	circle	the	castle	to	see	what	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	 on.	 The	 instruction	 given,	 the	 pilot	 pulled	 the	 nose	 up	 to	 slow	 their airspeed	as	the	helicopter	came	into	a	hover	around	two	hundred	feet	above	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">eastern	 wall,	 circling	 slowly	 around	 the	 gun	 tower,	 its	 searchlight	 picked	 out several	figures	on	the	roof.	Peterson	pointed	towards	the	fire	and	the	helicopter</p>
<p class="calibre1">proceeded	 along	 the	 southern	 wall,	 trying	 to	 make	 out	 what	 was	 going	 on beneath	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 they	 neared	 the	 centre	 of	 the	 complex,	 a	 hail	 of	 gunfire	 pinged	 off	 the underbelly	 of	 the	 aircraft	 as	 the	 pilot	 began	 an	 evasive	 manoeuvre.	 One	 of	 the soldiers	 had	 been	 hit	 and	 was	 hanging	 by	 his	 harness,	 clinging	 on	 to	 the doorway,	 while	 the	 other	 team	 member	 returned	 fire	 towards	 the	 origin	 of	 the muzzle	 flashes.	 As	 soon	 as	 they	 were	 back	 over	 the	 water,	 Sergeant	 Jones reached	a	gloved	hand	down	and	hauled	his	squad	member	back	up,	slamming</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	sliding	door	shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peterson	was	shouting	over	the	intercom	for	the	pilot	to	gain	height	and	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 hell	 out	 of	 there.	 They	 had	 seen	 enough	 action	 for	 one	 night	 and	 now	 had another	casualty	to	bring	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	stared	out	of	the	window,	his	eyes	wide	in	disbelief.	One	of	the	crewmen</p>
<p class="calibre1">put	a	hand	on	his	shoulder	as	his	whole	body	seemed	to	sag.	Head	in	hands,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p202"></a>started	to	sob,	tears	streaming	down	his	face,	his	imagination	running	wild.	The castle	 and	 the	 flames	 slipped	 from	 view	 as	 the	 helicopter	 skimmed	 the	 waves past	the	Needles,	flying	fast	and	low	back	out	to	sea.	The	 <i class="calibre4">Chester</i>	was	cruising north-east	 five	 nautical	 miles	 south	 of	 Portland	 Bill,	 rapidly	 closing	 the	 gap	 to meet	them. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In	the	bowels	of	the	castle,	deep	within	an	alcove	of	one	of	the	dark,	dank	cellars that	had	once	been	a	dungeon	for	prisoners	held	at	Hurst,	Tommy	and	the	others</p>
<p class="calibre1">sat	shivering	under	blankets.	They	were	listening	to	the	faint	sounds	of	the	battle above	them,	with	the	dim	flickering	light	of	a	candle	for	company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	 going	 to	 be	 fine,	 Toby,”	 said	 Simon,	 sat	 to	 his	 right.	 “There’s	 really nothing	to	worry	about.	We’re	all	perfectly	safe	down	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Toby	pulled	the	blanket	tighter	around	his	shoulders,	clasping	the	two	corners</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	his	clenched	fists.	The	boy	nodded,	but	said	nothing.	From	the	first	explosion</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	had	been	terrified,	cowering	behind	his	father	as	they	shielded	their	ears	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">watched	the	dust	rain	down	upon	them.	They	were	not	alone;	there	were	as	many</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	twenty	others	hiding	down	here,	on	the	instructions	of	Liz.	This	was	the	safest</p>
<p class="calibre1">place	in	the	castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 only	 way	 in	 was	 defended	 by	 a	 dozen	 armed	 men,	 not	 to	 mention</p>
<p class="calibre1">countless	feet	of	thick	stone	and	concrete.	It	was	a	bunker	complex	that	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">probably	withstand	any	number	of	direct	hits	from	heavy	weapons	and	certainly</p>
<p class="calibre1">impenetrable	to	small	arms	fire.	And	yet,	knowing	all	that	did	little	to	reassure</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	younger	members	of	the	Hurst	group.	Many	of	them	still	carried	the	very	real</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	psychological	scars	of	the	breakdown.	They	had	each	seen	more	than	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">fair	 share	 of	 death	 and	 destruction.	 They	 had	 witnessed	 sane	 people	 driven	 to madness.	In	the	race	for	survival,	it	had	been	every	man	for	himself.	They	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">seen	 neighbours	 fighting,	 riots	 in	 supermarkets,	 men	 shot	 in	 cold	 blood	 before their	very	eyes.	Hearing	the	explosions	and	fire	fight	above	them	brought	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">memories	flooding	back	in	technicolour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	knew	from	their	stories	that	little	Toby	had	seen	his	mother	die.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 been	 wrenched	 from	 his	 hands,	 not	 by	 the	 virus,	 like	 so	 many	 others,	 but knocked	down	and	killed	by	a	motorbike,	stolen	and	out	of	control.	The	driver</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 been	 hell-bent	 on	 getting	 out	 of	 town.	 Dodging	 stationary	 traffic	 he	 had mounted	 the	 pavement	 and	 clipped	 a	 bench,	 lost	 control	 and	 careered	 into	 two children	 holding	 hands,	 before	 striking	 his	 mother.	 She	 had	 died	 instantly,	 her eyes	 fixed	 with	 a	 look	 of	 surprise	 that	 was	 seared	 into	 Toby’s	 memory	 and nightmares	forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Footsteps	 in	 the	 stairwell	 shook	 Tommy	 from	 his	 melancholy.	 Nathan	 stuck</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p204"></a>his	 head	 around	 the	 corner,	 putting	 on	 a	 brave	 face.	 His	 cheer	 was	 paper-thin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyes	betrayed	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	are	we	all	doing	down	here?”	He	stuck	his	thumbs	up,	trying	to	make</p>
<p class="calibre1">eye	contact	with	Toby	and	some	of	the	other	children,	who	looked	at	their	feet, </p>
<p class="calibre1">nodding	 their	 heads.	 “Good,	 good.	 Simon,	 Tommy,	 Shannon,	 we	 need	 you	 up</p>
<p class="calibre1">top.	 Rest	 of	 you,	 stay	 put,	 we’ll	 bring	 you	 down	 something	 to	 eat	 as	 soon	 as we’re	done,	but	for	now,	this	is	the	safest	place	in	the	castle.	Okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon	and	the	others	got	gingerly	to	their	feet,	exchanging	sheepish	glances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Toby	started	moaning,	clawing	at	his	father’s	leg,	pleading	with	him	not	to	leave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon	 smiled	 back	 at	 him.	 “I’ll	 be	 back	 as	 soon	 as	 I	 can.”	 He	 ruffled	 his son’s	hair	and	steeled	himself	for	the	task	at	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	top	of	the	stairs,	there	was	a	palpable	tension	in	the	air,	with	half-seen</p>
<p class="calibre1">faces	 hurrying	 through	 dimly	 lit	 passageways,	 torchlight	 dancing	 on	 walls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nathan	 handed	 Tommy	 a	 revolver	 and	 deposited	 a	 box-full	 of	 bullets	 in	 his outstretched	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	handed	out	an	antique	sword	and	a	machete	to	the	other	two	and	motioned</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	 to	 huddle	 in	 close.	 “I	 need	 you	 three	 to	 guard	 the	 Drake	 doorway	 on	 the ground	floor.	Barricade	it	with	whatever	you	can	find.	And	if	anyone	or	anything</p>
<p class="calibre1">tries	to	come	through,	shoot	them.	This	is	our	last	line.	We	have	to	defend	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">bit	of	the	castle,	at	all	costs.	All	our	lives	depend	on	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 led	 the	 trio	 down	 to	 their	 station,	 checked	 the	 door	 was	 locked	 and bolted	top	and	bottom	and	started	piling	up	chairs	and	boxes,	with	an	old	carpet</p>
<p class="calibre1">dumped	on	top	to	hold	everything	in	place.	They	stood	back	and	admired	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">handiwork.	It	would	hold.	Tommy	was	sure	of	that.	No	one	was	going	to	push</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 way	 through	 that	 lot,	 especially	 with	 him	 taking	 potshots	 at	 them.	 He loaded	the	revolver	with	six	bullets	and	emptied	the	rest	of	the	box	into	his	waist pocket,	discarding	the	empty	carton. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	froze.	From	just	outside	the	door,	they	could	hear	muffled	voices	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">scuffed	 footsteps	 on	 the	 stone	 floor.	 The	 three	 of	 them	 unconsciously	 stepped backwards,	awkwardly	clutching	their	weapons.	There	was	a	series	of	dull	thuds</p>
<p class="calibre1">against	 the	 door,	 although	 it	 didn’t	 sound	 like	 they	 were	 trying	 to	 force	 entry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	 louder	 thump	 and	 then	 the	 sound	 of	 liquid,	 like	 someone	 relieving themselves	against	the	door.	They	smelled	the	fuel	before	they	saw	it	as	a	rivulet</p>
<p class="calibre1">snaked	 under	 the	 door,	 pooling	 directly	 below	 the	 stack	 of	 chairs	 and	 boxes, soaking	into	the	cardboard.	They	heard	the	strike	of	a	match	and	then	a	whoosh</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	the	fuel	vapour	ignited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 reacted	 first.	 He	 ran	 down	 the	 corridor	 back	 towards	 the	 basement</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	Toby	and	the	other	children	were	cowering.	In	the	corner	of	the	room	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	bucket	that	the	children	had	been	using	as	a	toilet.	It	was	half-full,	stinking	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p205"></a>slopping	 as	 Tommy	 ran	 back	 towards	 the	 doorway.	 When	 he	 reached	 the passageway,	 the	 smoke	 on	 the	 inside	 was	 already	 spreading	 rapidly	 throughout the	complex,	blown	by	drafts	and	air	currents	that	made	the	castle	freezing	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">winter.	He	got	as	close	to	the	door	as	he	could	and	threw	the	bucketload	of	slops</p>
<p class="calibre1">across	the	floor,	trying	to	sluice	the	petrol	away.	It	did	little	more	than	disperse the	fuel	more	widely	around	the	doorway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 other	 three	 had	 raced	 off	 to	 try	 and	 find	 the	 buckets	 of	 sand	 placed around	the	castle	complex,	leaving	Tommy	alone	watching	the	fire	take	hold.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">kicked	at	the	furniture	stack,	trying	to	dislodge	the	nearest	item.	Their	hard	work to	 secure	 the	 door	 had	 turned	 out	 to	 be	 misplaced	 effort.	 The	 chairs	 and	 boxes were	wedged	solid	and	he	was	forced	back	by	the	heat	and	choking	fumes.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">tried	 one	 last	 time,	 grabbing	 hold	 of	 the	 carpet	 balanced	 precariously	 on	 top. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gravity	 did	 the	 rest	 and	 the	 whole	 stack	 collapsed	 against	 the	 opposite	 wall, blocking	 the	 passage.	 The	 initial	 flash	 from	 the	 petrol	 began	 to	 die	 down	 as flames	licked	harmlessly	at	the	stone	walls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 shielded	 his	 face	 from	 the	 heat,	 retreating	 back	 down	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">passageway.	He	stayed	low	until	the	smoke	was	less	dense.	From	all	directions</p>
<p class="calibre1">men	 and	 women	 were	 shouting,	 panicked	 by	 cloying	 fumes	 that	 made	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">chests	heave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nathan	raced	down	the	stairs,	appealing	to	Tommy	and	the	others	to	get	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	their	posts.	“For	God’s	sake,	put	those	fires	out.	Smother	them	in	blankets,	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatever	 you	 can	 find.	 They’re	 trying	 to	 smoke	 us	 out,”	 he	 shouted	 over	 his shoulder,	racing	to	the	next	post. </p><p class="calibre1">

In	 the	 shadow	 of	 the	 castle’s	 western	 wall,	 Will	 was	 making	 slow	 but	 steady progress,	creeping	towards	the	main	gate,	making	as	little	sound	as	possible.	He<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">was	 keeping	 his	 eyes	 on	 the	 vessel	 that	 had	 moored	 up	 a	 few	 minutes	 ago, hoping	he	was	invisible	in	the	darkness.	He	counted	eleven	men	as	one	by	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 dashed	 across	 the	 roadway	 to	 wait	 by	 the	 drawbridge,	 pressed	 against	 the stone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	 crouched	 behind	 a	 gorse	 bush,	 waiting	 for	 them	 to	 make	 their	 move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 he	 heard	 the	 explosions,	 he	 was	 paralysed	 for	 a	 few	 minutes.	 Without	 a weapon,	 he	 stood	 little	 chance	 against	 Copper’s	 heavily	 armed	 paramilitaries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	best	chance	was	to	disarm	a	lone	guard	and	attack	from	the	rear	where	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 least	 expect	 it.	 He	 thought	 he	 glimpsed	 Copper	 giving	 orders,	 but	 he couldn’t	be	sure	from	this	distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	lost	sight	of	the	group	when	Copper’s	men	headed	inside.	There	was	now</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p206"></a>only	a	single	figure	left	guarding	the	entrance.	This	was	the	best	chance	he	was going	to	get.	Will	crept	closer	and	was	now	no	more	than	thirty	metres	away.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognised	the	guard	from	his	time	at	the	hospital:	a	spotty	youth,	seventeen	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">most.	Will	fancied	his	chances	and	readied	himself	to	pounce.	He	was	a	dozen</p>
<p class="calibre1">footsteps	away	when	his	boot	slipped	on	a	rock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	as	if	the	next	few	milliseconds	were	in	slow	motion.	The	kid	whipped</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 head	 around,	 surprised	 to	 see	 Will	 so	 close.	 He	 glanced	 down	 to	 flick	 the safety	off	his	semi-automatic	rifle	before	bringing	it	to	bear.	Will	threw	himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 last	 few	 metres,	 lunging	 at	 the	 weapon,	 trying	 to	 knock	 it	 from	 the	 kid’s grasp.	The	boy	fumbled	for	the	safety	and	was	a	fraction	of	a	second	too	slow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 gun	 fired	 just	 as	 Will’s	 lead	 hand	 knocked	 it	 sideways,	 the	 bullet	 passing harmlessly	through	the	fabric	of	his	shirt.	Will	wrestled	the	gun	from	the	boy’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands	and	brought	the	butt	down	against	the	side	of	his	head,	knocking	the	youth</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	searched	the	boy’s	pockets	and	found	a	torch	and	two	more	clips,	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">climbing	 through	 what	 remained	 of	 the	 gate	 and	 drawbridge.	 Standing	 in	 the covered	 entrance	 were	 two	 more	 of	 Copper’s	 men,	 facing	 away	 from	 him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">oblivious	to	his	approach.	At	the	last	moment,	one	of	the	men	turned	his	head.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 one	 of	 the	 guards	 from	 the	 hospital,	 responsible	 for	 many	 of	 the	 beatings and	blows	Will	had	suffered.	The	other	man	he	had	seen	at	the	pub. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will’s	lip	curled	into	a	snarl,	as	he	squeezed	off	a	short	burst	from	the	hip	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">close	 range,	 propelling	 the	 man	 forward	 against	 the	 wall.	 His	 next	 victim suffered	 a	 similar	 fate,	 slumping	 to	 the	 ground,	 clutching	 at	 the	 wound	 in	 his lower	 back.	 Will	 stepped	 over	 their	 bodies,	 pausing	 to	 meet	 the	 look	 of	 pained surprise	from	eyes	that	were	already	closing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 stood	 with	 his	 back	 against	 the	 wall	 to	 the	 guardhouse,	 catching	 his breath,	 considering	 his	 next	 move.	 Will	 crouched	 down	 suddenly	 as	 a	 face appeared	at	the	window	before	darting	out	of	sight	again.	Will	smiled,	struggling</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	contain	a	laugh.	A	blur	of	red	hair	remained	just	visible.	It	had	to	be	Scottie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	couldn’t	be	more	than	a	thousand	people	left	alive	with	hair	like	that.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">put	his	face	close	to	the	glass	and	whispered	quietly.	“Hey,	Scottie.	It’s	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scottie	 must	 have	 recognised	 the	 friendly	 voice	 instantly,	 but	 remained</p>
<p class="calibre1">hidden,	not	quite	believing	his	ears.	“Will,	is	that	really	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	 else	 would	 it	 be,	 you	 giant	 sporran?	 Get	 this	 door	 open	 will	 you	 and get	out	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	a	few	seconds	of	loud	scraping	and	thumps	as	Scottie	moved	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">desk	and	cabinet	out	of	the	way.	The	key	turned	in	the	lock	and	the	heavy	door</p>
<p class="calibre1">swung	open.	Scottie’s	beaming	smile	greeted	Will	and	they	hugged	each	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,	laddie.	Time	to	get	our	own	back.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">The	helicopter	carrying	Sam	and	Jack	lined	up	astern	of	the	American	destroyer</p>
<p class="calibre1">making	 final	 course	 and	 speed	 corrections	 to	 compensate	 for	 the	 fourteen-knot crosswind.	The	 <i class="calibre4">Chester</i>’s	landing	area	was	fully	floodlit.	The	rest	of	the	ship	was still	 shrouded	 in	 darkness,	 its	 slow	 turning	 radar	 just	 visible.	 A	 forest	 of	 radio masts	and	antennas	were	silhouetted	against	a	grey	skyline,	growing	brighter	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	distance.	On	the	deck	below	them,	an	air	marshal	was	standing	in	the	shelter</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	aft	superstructure,	holding	high	two	illuminated	hand	beacons	to	guide	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pilot.	A	light	sea	swell	required	precision	timing	to	adjust	for	the	rise	and	fall	of the	ship.	To	Sam’s	relief,	they	touched	down	safely	just	off	centre	of	the	“H”	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	landing	area	at	the	stern	of	the	destroyer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	pilot	powered	down	the	engines	as	the	ground	crew	hurried	out	to	slide</p>
<p class="calibre1">open	 the	 side	 door,	 ready	 to	 transfer	 the	 injured	 on	 to	 two	 trolleys	 that	 were brought	out	to	meet	the	aircraft.	Sam	wiped	tears	from	his	eyes,	still	haunted	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	he	had	seen	as	they’d	flown	over	the	castle.	He	unclipped	his	harness,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">helped	the	airmen	lift	the	first	gurney	holding	the	wounded	soldier	on	to	the	deck</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 ship.	 On	 a	 count	 of	 three,	 they	 levered	 Jack's	 barely	 conscious	 body	 up and	 over	 the	 trolley’s	 metal	 rail,	 which	 was	 promptly	 raised	 and	 clamped	 into position.	Two	crewmembers	from	the	 <i class="calibre4">Chester</i>	 took	 over	 the	 care	 of	 the	 injured and	wheeled	them	inside,	towards	the	dim	red	light	of	the	ship’s	hatch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	 followed	 silently	 behind	 Jack’s	 trolley,	 his	 mind	 still	 trying	 to	 make sense	of	the	confused	scenes	he	had	witnessed	on	their	return,	in	particular	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">inferno	burning	in	the	canteen	and	stores.	What	could	have	happened?	He	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	assume	the	castle	was	under	attack,	but	by	whom	and	why? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peterson	 caught	 up	 with	 them:	 “Wait	 up.”	 Sam	 paused	 in	 the	 cramped</p>
<p class="calibre1">confines	of	a	passageway,	just	wide	enough	for	two	men	to	pass,	with	pipes	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">overhead	 cabling	 stretching	 as	 far	 as	 he	 could	 see.	 Peterson	 put	 an	 arm	 around Sam’s	shoulder.	“I’ll	ask	the	master	of	the	watch	to	set	you	up	with	somewhere</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	sleep.	You	hungry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	it’s	okay	with	you,	I’d	like	to	stay	with	Jack,”	said	Sam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’ll	be	well	looked	after.	The	medic	will	patch	him	up.	If	I	were	you,	I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	some	rest.	As	soon	as	it’s	light,	we’ll	take	a	squad	back	to	Hurst	to	find	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	happened.	Petty	Officer	Flannigan	will	take	care	of	you.	Just	tell	him	what</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p208"></a>you	need	and	he’ll	fix	you	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Flannigan	was	standing	ready,	his	hands	behind	his	back.	He	wore	a	blue	T-</p>
<p class="calibre1">shirt	with	the	ship’s	insignia	on	it.	He	acknowledged	the	order	and	invited	Sam</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	follow	him	down	to	the	medical	centre. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
The	surgeon	attended	to	Jack,	dressed	in	green	overalls	and	a	surgical	mask	that<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">obscured	 half	 his	 face.	 He	 looked	 up	 at	 Sam	 with	 smiling	 eyes,	 noting	 his melancholy.	 “You	 must	 be	 Sam.	 People	 call	 me	 Doc.	 I’m	 the	 senior	 medical officer	on	this	ship.	Looks	like	your	friend	Jack	here	has	been	in	the	wars.	Don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">worry.	We’ll	have	him	back	on	his	feet	in	no	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	 thanked	 the	 surgeon	 and	 lingered	 shell-shocked	 as	 a	 female	 nurse</p>
<p class="calibre1">swabbed	the	nasty-looking	wound	to	a	shoulder	that	would	need	several	stitches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Flannigan	 escorted	 him	 back	 to	 a	 waiting	 room	 along	 the	 corridor.	 As	 soon	 as Sam	sat	down	on	the	plastic	chair,	he	was	overwhelmed	with	tiredness.	By	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	 Flannigan	 reappeared	 with	 a	 mess	 tray	 complete	 with	 a	 mug	 of	 coffee,	 a carton	 of	 milk,	 some	 pasta	 with	 tomato	 sauce,	 together	 with	 canned	 fruit	 in syrup,	Sam	had	his	head	back	against	the	whitewashed	wall,	already	fast	asleep. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
Flannigan	 left	 him	 to	 sleep,	 shaking	 him	 awake	 a	 few	 hours	 later,	 the	 tray	 still beside	his	chair,	untouched.	Sam	looked	up,	his	eyes	red	and	swollen,	to	see	the<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">welcome	sight	of	Jack	standing	there,	braced	against	the	doorway.	Jack	wore	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">US	 navy	 grey	 sweatshirt,	 his	 face	 still	 pale,	 his	 arm	 in	 a	 sling,	 but	 with	 a purposeful	look	about	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	 told	 me	 what	 happened,	 Sam.	 About	 Terra.	 About	 Hurst.”	 His	 voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 croaky	 when	 he	 spoke.	 He	 swallowed	 hard,	 before	 continuing	 in	 a	 low voice,	through	gritted	teeth.	“We’ve	got	to	get	back	there.	We	should	never	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">left	our	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 surgeon	 appeared	 behind	 him,	 eavesdropping	 on	 their	 conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	hold	up,	Jack.	When	my	men	found	you,	you	were	in	shock,	in	no	state	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	 anything.	 What	 you	 need,	 my	 friend,	 is	 a	 couple	 of	 days’	 bed	 rest.”	 He paused,	noticing	the	wild	look	in	Jack’s	eyes.	“But	I	can	see	from	the	half-crazed</p>
<p class="calibre1">look	in	your	eyes	that	that’s	not	going	to	happen.	Best	thing	I	can	suggest	is	that I	 take	 you	 straight	 to	 the	 bridge	 and	 you	 talk	 to	 the	 commanding	 officer, Lieutenant	Peterson.	I	think	y’all	have	met.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	appreciate	your	concern,	doctor,	but	I	need	to	get	off	this	ship	and	find	out</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p209"></a>what	happened.	My	place	is	with	my	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very	 well.	 Flannigan,	 can	 you	 take	 these	 gentlemen	 to	 the	 bridge	 and	 find the	CO?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	long	walk	through	countless	corridors,	upstairs	and	along	a	maze	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">passageways	 that	 twisted	 and	 turned	 past	 rooms	 full	 of	 sleeping	 men,	 of	 loud machinery,	 panels	 with	 flashing	 lights,	 knobs	 and	 dials,	 mess	 halls	 and	 store rooms,	 looking	 left	 and	 right.	 It	 was	 a	 busy	 hive	 of	 activity.	 All	 the	 crewmen they	passed	were	polite	and	stepped	out	of	their	way	into	recesses	or	doorways, </p>
<p class="calibre1">staring	after	them.	Jack	could	sense	they	were	being	watched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	possible	they	were	the	first	civilians	they	had	seen	in	quite	some	time, </p>
<p class="calibre1">being	 insulated	 and	 cut	 off	 from	 the	 outside	 world.	 The	 look	 on	 their	 faces masked	 a	 thousand	 questions,	 but	 at	 the	 same	 time,	 they	 were	 wary	 of	 the newcomers.	They	stepped	back;	some	of	them	shielded	their	faces	or	even	held</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 breath.	 Jack	 imagined	 that	 they	 had	 seen	 the	 virus	 at	 close	 quarters	 on board	and	remained	cautious	of	outsiders,	giving	them	a	wide	berth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 approached	 a	 grey	 security	 door	 with	 the	 letters	 “Bridge”	 stencilled across	 its	 centre.	 An	 armed	 guard	 stepped	 into	 their	 path	 and	 asked	 them	 their names.	 Jack	 noticed	 a	 sidearm	 in	 his	 holster.	 He	 eyed	 the	 two	 civilians suspiciously,	 glancing	 from	 one	 to	 the	 other	 and	 back	 at	 Flannigan,	 before pressing	the	intercom	to	announce	their	arrival.	The	door	was	buzzed	open	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	group	stepped	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 bridge	 reminded	 Jack	 of	 stepping	 into	 the	 cockpit	 of	 an	 airliner,	 just much	 bigger.	 Every	 wall	 and	 panel	 was	 a	 sea	 of	 lights,	 computer	 monitors	 and flashing	buttons.	Uniformed	men	with	binoculars	scanned	the	horizon	for	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">vessels.	 Looking	 out	 over	 the	 ship’s	 bow	 cresting	 through	 the	 waves,	 Jack realised	 it	 was	 just	 before	 dawn.	 The	 sky	 was	 brighter	 in	 the	 east	 towards	 the island,	 just	 visible	 in	 the	 distance.	 To	 their	 north-west,	 towards	 Bournemouth and	 Christchurch,	 a	 patch	 of	 black	 clouds	 hurried	 through,	 rainsqualls	 falling beneath.	Sunrise	was	around	twenty	minutes	away,	but	it	was	growing	brighter</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 the	 minute.	 Once	 the	 rain	 cleared	 it	 looked	 set	 to	 be	 a	 clear,	 crisp	 morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peterson	 was	 speaking	 into	 what	 looked	 like	 an	 old-fashioned	 grey-green</p>
<p class="calibre1">telephone,	 relaying	 commands,	 talking	 animatedly	 but	 with	 calm	 authority.	 He looked	up	and	saw	Sam	and	Jack	waiting	patiently	and	hung	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	are	you	feeling,	Jack?”	He	inclined	his	head	with	some	concern.	“Doc</p>
<p class="calibre1">tells	 me	 you’ll	 need	 time	 to	 recover	 your	 strength.	 Recommended	 you	 stay	 put for	a	couple	of	days	until	you’re	better.”	Jack’s	eyebrows	narrowed	and	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	on	the	point	of	saying	something	he	might	regret,	when	Peterson	raised	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand.	“Please,	Jack,	let	me	finish.	I	told	him	in	no	uncertain	terms	that	while	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">respect	his	medical	opinion,	if	it	was	me,	I	would	probably	jump	over	board	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p210"></a>swim	the	rest	of	the	way	to	be	with	my	team.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 smiled.	 He	 admired	 Peterson.	 He	 had	 an	 easy	 manner	 around	 other</p>
<p class="calibre1">people,	a	sense	of	irony	uncommon	in	the	few	Americans	he’d	met,	and	a	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">“British”,	or	at	least	transatlantic,	outlook.	Altogether	it	made	him	a	good	leader in	 the	 circumstances.	 He	 was	 capable	 of	 uniting	 all	 the	 disparate	 groups. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peterson	 maintained	 eye	 contact	 with	 Jack,	 watching	 his	 expressions	 change, studying	him	carefully	before	continuing.	Jack	was	normally	so	good	at	reading</p>
<p class="calibre1">people,	 so	 why	 did	 he	 find	 Peterson	 so	 intriguing,	 so	 full	 of	 small</p>
<p class="calibre1">contradictions?	He	suspected	there	was	more	to	him	than	met	the	eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	 here’s	 what	 I’m	 going	 to	 do,”	 continued	 Peterson.	 “We	 have	 a	 UAV</p>
<p class="calibre1">prepped	 for	 launch	 once	 there’s	 enough	 daylight	 to	 see	 anything.	 What	 do	 you say	we	make	a	sweep	over	Hurst?	Find	out	what’s	going	on	there	and	then	push</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	to	Osborne	and	see	if	we	can’t	track	down	Briggs.	Sound	like	a	plan?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	looked	from	Peterson	to	Sam	and	back	again,	wondering	what	the	hell</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	was	talking	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peterson	noticed	Jack’s	confusion	and	apologised.	“Sorry,	navy	jargon,	Jack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unmanned	Aerial	Vehicle.	I’m	sure	you’re	familiar	with	the	Predator	or	Reaper</p>
<p class="calibre1">drones	used	by	the	Air	Force	for	hunting	down	terrorists.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 nodded.	 He	 knew	 exactly	 what	 Peterson	 was	 talking	 about	 now.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembered	the	grainy	footage	from	Syria,	Iraq	and	Afghanistan	live-streamed</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 TV	 news	 audiences	 of	 vehicles	 exploding,	 remote	 piloted	 from	 a	 darkened room	thousands	of	miles	away.	He	had	no	idea	they	had	drones	on	ships	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course,	the	drones	we	use	are	a	little	bit	different.	Shorter	range,	smaller</p>
<p class="calibre1">payloads,	but	very	effective	at	getting	eyes	on	a	target	for	missile	strikes.	We	use them	 for	 reconnaissance	 before	 we	 put	 boots	 on	 the	 ground.	 We	 like	 to	 know what	we’re	up	against.	If	it’s	okay	with	you,	why	don’t	we	grab	a	cup	of	coffee</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	go	watch	on	the	big	monitors	in	the	stateroom?	We’ll	be	more	comfortable</p>
<p class="calibre1">there.	 Acting	 XO,	 you	 have	 the	 conn.	 Jansen,	 can	 you	 pipe	 the	 feed	 through? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Follow	me,	gentlemen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	 and	 Jack	 followed	 Peterson	 through	 the	 ship	 to	 a	 stateroom	 that	 was luxuriously	appointed,	beyond	their	expectations.	Leather	chairs,	Lavazza	coffee</p>
<p class="calibre1">machine,	highly	polished	mahogany	table,	walls	lined	with	trophies.	There	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">colour	photos	of	the	ship	and	its	crew,	of	the	president,	of	their	home	port	in	San Diego,	of	their	former	captain	and	XO,	buried	at	sea	with	full	military	honours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	invited	them	to	take	a	seat,	served	them	hot	drinks	and	waited	for	the	screen</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 power	 up.	 In	 the	 corner,	 a	 technician	 busied	 himself	 at	 a	 control	 panel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Checking	 connections	 and	 settings,	 he	 looked	 up	 expectantly	 before	 the	 screen sprung	into	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 took	 a	 few	 seconds	 for	 the	 feed	 from	 the	 drone	 to	 stabilise.	 They	 could</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p211"></a>make	 out	 markings	 and	 numbers	 along	 the	 bottom	 of	 the	 screen,	 giving	 flight data	 back	 to	 the	 operator.	 Peterson	 put	 on	 a	 headset	 and,	 when	 he	 spoke,	 his voice	was	broadcast	to	the	room	so	they	could	all	hear	the	exchange.	The	feed</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	 showed	 the	 drone	 flying	 at	 around	 one	 hundred	 metres	 above	 sea	 level, heading	north-east	towards	Hurst.	After	a	few	minutes	of	flight	time,	they	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	the	Needles	rocks	in	the	distance	looming	large	before	the	nose	of	the	drone</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	to	come	up	as	its	speed	slowed	and	the	welcome	sight	of	the	castle	came</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 leaned	 forward,	 trying	 to	 make	 out	 the	 detail.	 Two	 separate	 plumes	 of smoke	 were	 rising	 hundreds	 of	 feet	 into	 the	 air;	 one	 from	 around	 the	 centre	 of the	 flank	 wall	 facing	 the	 Needles	 and	 the	 other	 seemed	 to	 originate	 from	 the Tudor	 castle	 itself.	 The	 drone	 came	 into	 a	 hover	 descending	 slowly	 above	 the southern	 wall,	 panning	 around	 to	 left	 and	 right.	 The	 original	 gun	 battery	 was now	 beneath	 them,	 where	 cannon	 would	 have	 faced	 outward	 guarding	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">entrance	 to	 the	 Solent.	 To	 Jack’s	 and	 Sam’s	 surprise,	 a	 figure	 they	 both recognised	stood	on	the	ramparts,	waving	a	weapon	above	his	head,	beckoning</p>
<p class="calibre1">towards	the	drone,	his	lips	moving.	He	seemed	to	be	shouting	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	turned	excitedly	to	Peterson:	“Do	we	have	audio?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	afraid	not.	Not	on	this	UAV	model.	Do	you	know	this	guy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Know	 him?	 You	 could	 say	 that.”	 He	 slapped	 Sam	 on	 the	 back,	 relieved	 to see	Will	returned	safe.	“Looks	like	he	made	it	back	just	in	the	nick	of	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p212"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Fifty-one</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	 and	 Scottie	 had	 fought	 their	 way	 on	 to	 the	 western	 ramparts	 of	 the	 castle complex	and	were	exchanging	fire	with	two	of	Copper’s	men.	They	took	turns	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">provide	 covering	 fire.	 Copper’s	 men	 were	 looking	 nervously	 over	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulders,	 perhaps	 worried	 about	 being	 cut	 off	 in	 case	 of	 a	 retreat.	 The	 main attacking	 force	 was	 still	 locked	 in	 skirmishes	 with	 Tommy	 and	 the	 rest	 of	 the riflemen	 on	 the	 roof	 of	 the	 gun	 tower	 who,	 by	 all	 accounts,	 were	 putting	 up	 a robust	defence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fire	in	the	canteen	was	dying	down.	There	was	nothing	left	to	burn.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">cardboard	 boxes	 and	 flammable	 contents	 of	 the	 storeroom	 had	 burned</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves	 out.	 The	 heat	 of	 the	 inferno	 had	 been	 considerable.	 Most	 likely fuelled	 by	 the	 industrial-size	 drum	 of	 cooking	 oil	 that	 Will	 assumed	 must	 have exploded,	sending	a	massive	smoke	cloud	billowing	into	the	pre-dawn	sky.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">canteen	 was	 now	 a	 shell.	 The	 kitchen	 and	 serving	 counter	 were	 barely</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognisable	in	the	charred	and	blackened	wreck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 Scottie’s	 belt,	 the	 walkie-talkie	 crackled	 with	 static	 on	 its	 clip.	 He fumbled	with	the	volume	dial,	straining	to	hear	over	the	exchange	of	gunfire.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	Nathan	again,	checking	on	their	progress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	 making	 our	 way	 to	 your	 position,”	 responded	 Scottie	 breathlessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ETA	 five	 minutes,	 if	 we	 can	 just	 get	 past	 these	 two	 guys	 firing	 on	 us.	 Any chance	you	can	help?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nathan	regretfully	informed	him	that	they	had	their	own	battle	to	fight.	There</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	nothing	for	it.	Will	and	Scottie	were	on	their	own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Copper’s	 men	 finally	 made	 their	 move.	 Firing	 wildly	 over	 Will’s	 position, they	scrambled	towards	the	rest	of	their	group	sheltering	just	outside	the	Tudor</p>
<p class="calibre1">gate.	Will	saw	them	leave	cover	and	took	careful	aim,	squeezing	off	a	short	burst</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	scythed	down	the	two	figures.	They	landed	in	a	tangle	of	limbs	on	the	grass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	clawed	his	way	to	safety	behind	a	pillar,	his	weapon	abandoned	a	few	yards</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind	in	the	open.	Scottie	patted	Will	on	the	back	and	covered	him	as	he	moved</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	 to	 the	 next	 doorway,	 scanning	 for	 targets.	 Their	 rapid	 advance	 attacking Copper’s	exposed	flank	induced	panic	as	several	faces	pointing	apprehensively</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 their	 direction.	 A	 strange	 humming	 noise	 to	 their	 right	 made	 Will	 reach	 out and	haul	Scottie	back.	It	sounded	like	a	large	insect	trapped	inside	a	greenhouse</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p213"></a>on	a	summer’s	day.	He	craned	his	head	round,	scanning	the	skies	trying	to	place what	 had	 to	 be	 man-made.	 Its	 pitch	 altered	 as	 the	 drone	 changed	 position, moving	closer	towards	them.	Keeping	close	to	the	wall,	staying	out	of	sight,	Will</p>
<p class="calibre1">backtracked	to	the	stairs	and	climbed	back	up	on	to	the	ramparts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Standing	 on	 the	 top	 with	 a	 panoramic	 view	 of	 the	 Needles	 passage,	 he	 was shielded	from	view	by	an	old	concrete	machine	gun	nest,	dating	from	the	Second</p>

Copper	 was	 already	 wary	 of	 being	 cut	 off	 from	 his	 prearranged	 exit	 route<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">towards	the	waiting	ferry.	If	things	did	not	go	to	plan,	he	wanted	to	avoid	having</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 go	 back	 the	 way	 they	 came.	 Going	 over	 the	 wall	 on	 to	 the	 beach	 and	 the waiting	 R.I.B.	 was	 too	 exposed,	 too	 dangerous.	 There	 was	 no	 sign	 of	 the	 kid they’d	 left	 to	 guard	 the	 main	 gate.	 Chances	 were	 he	 was	 already	 back	 on	 the boat.	 He	 knew	 it	 was	 a	 mistake	 to	 bring	 a	 boy.	 It	 had	 been	 the	 boss’s	 idea	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">“blood”	a	teenager. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where	 had	 these	 other	 two	 come	 from?	 How	 did	 his	 men	 fail	 to	 find	 them during	their	sweep	of	the	outbuildings,	when	they	were	rounding	up	prisoners	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 western	 wing?	 Perhaps	 there	 were	 more	 of	 them	 hiding	 out	 of	 sight.	 He could	not	be	sure	there	was	not	a	network	of	tunnels	running	beneath	their	feet, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 length	 and	 breadth	 of	 the	 castle,	 like	 the	 man	 had	 suggested.	 Copper	 was already	 getting	 cold	 feet.	 This	 whole	 attack	 had	 been	 a	 grand	 folly.	 The	 girls were	 probably	 never	 brought	 here.	 He	 had	 already	 lost	 too	 much	 tonight.	 He counted	seven	dead	and	five	or	six	wounded.	They	could	now	barely	muster	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">effective	fighting	force. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 looked	 around	 him	 at	 the	 contours	 of	 the	 grey	 walls	 and	 up	 into	 the brightening	sky.	Dawn	was	only	a	few	minutes	away.	Their	plan	had	depended</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 darkness,	 the	 advantage	 of	 surprise,	 not	 to	 mention	 superior	 weaponry	 and tactics.	They	were	running	out	of	time.	The	boss’s	plan	to	smoke	the	defenders</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	had	failed.	It	was	an	old	building,	made	of	stone,	and	none	of	the	fires	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	lit	had	really	taken	hold,	bar	one.	What’s	more,	it	had	begun	to	rain,	a	fine</p>
<p class="calibre1">drizzle	falling,	dampening	down	what	few	flames	they	had	managed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 boss	 seemed	 increasingly	 frustrated	 by	 Copper’s	 inability	 to	 make	 any headway	 against	 the	 Hurst	 defenders.	 The	 man	 in	 black	 cared	 little	 for	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p214"></a>losses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	will	always	be	plenty	more	like	them.	Men	wanting	to	bear	arms	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">vent	their	fury	on	the	world,”	his	boss	had	once	said.	It	was	like	a	game	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	seemed	strangely	amused	by	how	even	the	most	rational,	sane,	law-abiding</p>
<p class="calibre1">person	 could	 be	 corrupted	 by	 power.	 Acting	 without	 consequences	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">intoxicating,	 for	 anyone.	 He	 called	 it	 a	 licence	 of	 impunity.	 It	 was	 a	 grand experiment	to	see	who	could	be	influenced.	His	boss	took	a	perverse	delight	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">manipulating	 others,	 pulling	 their	 strings,	 like	 some	 puppet	 master.	 Copper allowed	him	his	small	victories.	He	understood	the	game	and	played	by	its	rules, </p>
<p class="calibre1">for	now.	His	boss	even	boasted	once	that	winning	over	Copper	and	his	squad	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">former	policemen	was	one	of	his	finest	achievements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According	to	his	boss,	no	one	was	immune	to	the	lure	of	power.	Copper	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">seen	 it	 so	 many	 times,	 even	 before	 the	 breakdown.	 In	 this	 new	 world	 without boundaries,	 formerly	 respectable	 figures	 of	 society,	 judges,	 teachers,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">particularly	 policemen,	 had	 been	 driven	 to	 extreme	 behaviours,	 in	 the	 secure knowledge	 that	 the	 justice	 system	 had	 failed.	 There	 would	 be	 no	 knock	 on	 the door,	no	repercussions.	Killing	was	like	a	drug,	and	his	boss	saw	himself	as	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pusher.	He	believed	that	every	red-blooded	human	had	the	right	to	quench	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">base	thirst	for	violence	and	destruction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Copper	 leaned	 in	 close	 to	 his	 boss	 and	 spoke	 quietly:	 “It’s	 time	 we	 were leaving.	Daybreak	is	less	than	an	hour	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 in	 black	 cocked	 his	 head	 and	 stared	 back	 at	 Copper,	 refusing	 to lower	 his	 voice.	 “What	 exactly	 are	 you	 afraid	 of?	 We	 haven’t	 come	 this	 far	 to give	up	now.”	He	seemed	unconcerned	by	who	might	hear	their	conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	 we	 stay	 here	 much	 longer,	 we’ll	 be	 vulnerable	 to	 a	 counter-attack,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">counselled	 Copper,	 appealing	 to	 his	 common	 sense.	 “We	 can’t	 risk	 getting	 cut off.	If	we	leave	now,	we	live	to	fight	another	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 boss	 sneered	 at	 Copper.	 “We’re	 not	 leaving	 without	 those	 girls.	 Unless we	find	them,	all	this	will	be	a	wasted	effort.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	it	on	good	authority	that	the	girls	were	never	here.	Staying	to	fight</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 folly.”	 Despite	 his	 attempt	 to	 remain	 calm,	 he	 was	 growing	 increasingly frustrated	with	his	commander’s	refusal	to	listen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	shouldn’t	believe	everything	you’re	told,”	he	mocked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Copper	noticed	the	rest	of	his	men	had	stopped	talking	and	were	listening	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 exchange.	 He	 knew	 what	 they	 were	 thinking.	 Their	 boss	 had	 lost	 it.	 This was	pure	rage.	He	wasn’t	thinking	straight.	The	men’s	loyalty	was	to	Copper	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	was	up	to	him	to	put	an	end	to	this.	He	needed	to	take	control. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sarge	waved	Copper	over	and	whispered	conspiratorially	for	a	few	minutes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">standing	a	few	yards	away	from	the	rest.	Copper	nodded	back	to	the	sergeant	but</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p215"></a>didn’t	 look	 totally	 convinced.	 On	 reflection,	 it	 seemed	 like	 the	 only	 option.	 It was	 in	 the	 best	 interests	 of	 the	 group.	 Their	 commander	 could	 no	 longer	 be trusted,	Copper	had	to	take	charge	before	anyone	else	got	killed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 boss	 was	 oblivious	 to	 their	 discussions,	 keeping	 his	 eyes	 fixed	 on	 the gate,	 listening	 to	 the	 movement	 and	 voices	 beyond.	 Copper	 walked	 up	 behind him,	 raised	 the	 butt	 of	 his	 rifle	 and	 brought	 it	 crashing	 down	 against	 his	 skull, knocking	him	out	cold.	His	body	collapsed	limply	on	to	the	grass.	One	man	took</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	arms,	another	his	feet	and	they	carried	the	unconscious	man	back	through	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">courtyard	towards	the	main	gate,	hugging	the	cover	of	the	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	hail	of	bullets	tore	up	the	ground	in	front	of	them.	The	gunfire	was	coming</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 the	 west,	 leaving	 them	 totally	 exposed.	 As	 one	 man	 tried	 to	 continue forward,	the	other	pulled	away	and	between	them	they	dropped	their	boss’s	inert</p>
<p class="calibre1">body	on	the	ground.	They	both	raced	into	the	covered	main	entrance,	throwing</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	backs	against	the	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Copper	shouted	after	them.	They	couldn’t	leave	him	behind.	Mutiny	was	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing,	but	leaving	him	to	be	captured	was	far	worse.	The	remainder	of	Copper’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">group	didn’t	look	back	and	walked	on.	They	supported	the	walking	wounded	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 them.	 Squeezing	 through	 the	 blast	 hole	 in	 the	 drawbridge,	 they	 trudged dejected	 from	 the	 castle	 towards	 the	 waiting	 ferry	 boat	 whose	 tired-sounding engines	were	spluttering	noisily,	ready	to	cast	off	as	soon	as	the	last	of	the	group was	back	on	board. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Copper	 paused	 at	 the	 drawbridge,	 one	 foot	 through	 the	 blast	 hole,	 as	 he looked	 back	 towards	 the	 courtyard	 with	 a	 heavy	 heart.	 This	 was	 not	 what	 he’d planned.	 This	 time	 there	 would	 be	 consequences,	 of	 that	 he	 had	 no	 doubt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Regardless	of	how	he	felt,	he	couldn’t	reach	his	leader	now	without	risking	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">own	life,	running	the	gauntlet	under	fire.	He	shook	his	head,	turned	towards	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">jetty	and	jogged	after	the	others.	There	would	be	hell	to	pay	for	this	treachery. </p><p class="calibre1">

<p class="calibre1">screens	and	flashing	buttons	cast	a	ghostly	grey	monochrome	over	the	operator’s</p>

<p class="calibre1">the	castle	walls	without	endangering	its	rotors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“CO,	 are	 you	 getting	 this?	 Looks	 like	 he’s	 mouthing	 something,	 trying	 to send	us	a	message?” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	 let’s	 take	 a	 look	 around,	 please.	 Get	 the	 XO	 on	 the	 line,	 and	 get	 a medical	team	prepped	to	go	help	those	guys.	Let	the	team	know	that	they	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">multiple	 casualties.	 Urgent	 medical	 attention	 required.	 Make	 sure	 they	 have	 an armed	escort.	We	won’t	know	what’s	going	on	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	drone	rose	high	over	Will’s	head	and	panned	around	the	rest	of	the	castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 on-screen	 image	 showed	 the	 dying	 embers	 of	 a	 campfire,	 passing	 over	 the courtyard,	pausing	to	take	photos	of	the	damaged	canteen.	Along	one	wall,	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 several	 bodies,	 slumped	 against	 the	 wall.	 From	 the	 groupings	 of	 bullet marks	 in	 the	 stone,	 it	 looked	 to	 Jack	 like	 a	 scene	 of	 execution.

<p class="calibre1">The	 drone	 moved	 away,	 hovering	 over	 the	 gate	 to	 the	 inner	 courtyard.	 It picked	out	more	bodies.	Injured	men	and	women	were	being	tended	to	and	made</p>

<p class="calibre1">blackened	doorways,	some	burned-out	debris	lying	nearby.	The	eastern	wing	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 castle	 appeared	 untouched.	 They	 could	 see	 figures	 emerging	 from	 their hiding	places,	pointing	up	at	the	drone	as	it	rose	higher	over	the	castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	we’ve	seen	enough	here.	Don’t	worry,	Jack,	the	helicopter	is	refuelled</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.	I	can	patch	you	through	now?	Give	me	a	minute.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 a	 delay	 of	 a	 few	 seconds	 as	 the	 drone	 continued	 on,	 passing	 the Lymington	river	entrance,	heading	across	the	Solent	towards	Cowes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	ahead,	sir.	I	have	Sergeant	Jones	on	the	line	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	 morning,	 sergeant.	 I	 trust	 you	 have	 things	 under	 control	 at	 Osborne House.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 sir.	 Quiet	 night.	 No	 sign	 of	 Briggs.	 Looks	 like	 he	 hightailed	 it	 out	 of here.	 The	 good	 news,	 sir?	 The	 tracker	 is	 active.	 We	 have	 a	 strong	 signal	 and show	 Briggs’s	 convoy	 on	 the	 main	 road	 heading	 north	 back	 towards	 us	 now. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p217"></a>“You’re	 making	 me	 hungry,	 sergeant,	 and	 not	 a	 little	 jealous,”	 smiled Peterson.	 “Listen	 up.	 We	 can	 divert	 the	 UAV	 to	 locate	 that	 convoy.	 We’re sending	a	helicopter	to	Hurst	to	tend	to	their	wounded	and	then	we’ll	head	on	to</p>

<p class="calibre1">Back	 on	 the	 screen,	 the	 UAV	 had	 crossed	 a	 beach	 and	 was	 heading	 inland over	the	Isle	of	Wight.	To	the	right	of	the	UAV	feed	appeared	a	digital	map	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 location	 of	 the	 convoy	 as	 a	 white	 dot	 moving	 slowly	 north.	 The	 tracker signal	 was	 pinging	 loud	 and	 clear	 from	 a	 transmitter,	 allegedly	 hidden</p>
<p class="calibre1">underneath	Briggs’s	motorcade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack’s	 eyes	 flicked	 from	 the	 video	 feed	 to	 the	 map	 and	 back	 again	 as	 the distance	between	the	two	closed	rapidly	on	a	conversion	course.	There	it	was.	In</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	extreme	distance	on	the	viewfinder,	they	could	just	make	out	the	motorcade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 were	 four,	 no,	 five	 vehicles	 bumping	 along	 the	 road	 from	 Newport</p>
<p class="calibre1">heading	 back	 towards	 Cowes.	 At	 the	 head	 of	 a	 convoy	 was	 a	 baby	 Humvee, likely	stolen	and	adapted	for	Briggs’s	own	purposes,	with	a	large	cattle	grill	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	front,	a	bank	of	spotlights	on	the	cabin	roof	and	what	looked	like	metal	plates welded	to	the	front	and	sides. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chances	are	they’re	heading	back	towards	Osborne	with	reinforcements,	sir. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finish	what	they	started.	What	are	your	orders?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 may	 not	 get	 a	 better	 chance	 at	 this,	 sergeant.	 Let’s	 take	 them	 out	 here and	now.	CO	to	fire	team.	Prep	a	Tomahawk	for	us,	can	you,	please? </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Fire	when	ready.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	forward	missile	hatch	on	the	 <i class="calibre4">Chester</i>	slowly	levered	its	bay	doors	vertical, its	hydraulic	pistons	whirring	in	the	morning	peace	on	deck.	On	the	big	screen	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 stateroom,	 the	 image	 switched	 to	 a	 camera	 showing	 the	 missile	 hatch	 now fully	open.	The	ship’s	bow	crested	through	the	waves,	sending	spray	twenty	feet</p>
<p class="calibre1">either	 side.	 There	 was	 a	 pause	 before	 the	 rockets	 fired.	 Out	 of	 an	 eruption	 of smoke,	 the	 missile	 accelerated	 vertically	 into	 the	 grey	 morning	 sky,	 leaving	 a vapour	 trail	 behind	 it.	 The	 column	 of	 smoke	 drifted	 to	 their	 starboard	 in	 the breeze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 jolted,	 his	 whole	 body	 shaking,	 as	 if	 he’d	 been	 woken	 from	 a	 dream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait,	wait…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peterson	and	Sam	glanced	sideways	at	him,	as	if	he’d	lost	his	marbles. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p218"></a>“Call	 off	 the	 attack,	 lieutenant.	 How	 do	 we	 know	 Terra’s	 not	 with	 Briggs? </p>

<p class="calibre1">Peterson’s	eyes	flicked	from	Jack	back	to	the	screen.	He	was	considering	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">new	 information,	 weighing	 his	 options	 before	 seeming	 to	 nod,	 his	 mind	 made up.	“I	can’t	do	that,	Jack.	This	may	be	the	only	chance	we	get	to	take	out	Briggs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s	the	biggest	risk	to	Camp	Wight	we	have	right	now.	Lives	at	Osborne	are	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">stake.	We	need	to	take	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	must	be	another	way?	Please.	I’m	begging	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sorry.	There’s	no	way	to	stop	the	missile.	There’s	nothing	I	can	do	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	clasped	his	hands	together,	to	impress	upon	Jack	the	finality	of	his	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 missile	 had	 only	 five	 miles	 left	 to	 run	 and	 stayed	 relatively	 low.	 It tracked	 north-east,	 speeding	 south	 of	 the	 Needles.	 Accelerating	 towards	 its maximum	 velocity,	 it	 arced	 over	 the	 island	 and	 just	 as	 suddenly	 started	 its descent.	 The	 screen	 in	 the	 stateroom	 alternated	 between	 the	 view	 from	 the missile	 back	 to	 the	 drone,	 keeping	 pace	 with	 the	 convoy	 at	 about	 five	 hundred feet.	 The	 missile	 raced	 towards	 its	 target,	 dipping	 down	 as	 it	 reached	 terminal velocity,	zeroing	in	on	the	heat	signature	of	the	lead	vehicle	carrying	the	tracker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 found	 he	 was	 holding	 his	 breath,	 fearing	 what	 was	 to	 follow.	 The	 screen went	completely	white,	followed	by	static	as	the	missile	detonated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 operator	 switched	 views	 back	 to	 the	 drone.	 It	 showed	 a	 massive</p>
<p class="calibre1">explosion	and	a	mushroom	cloud	of	smoke.	It	took	a	couple	of	minutes	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">smoke	to	clear	sufficiently	for	them	to	make	out	the	scene	of	destruction.	A	huge</p>
<p class="calibre1">crater	 emerged	 in	 the	 roadway.	 One	 vehicle	 was	 a	 tangled	 mess.	 Bodies	 lay motionless	nearby.	Two	other	vehicles	were	on	their	sides.	The	last	car,	further</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind,	had	its	four	doors	open.	Figures	stood	gawping	down	the	road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	we	zoom	in	at	all,	Jenkins?	Would	be	good	to	get	a	look	at	those	guys.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	drone	dropped	altitude	and	zoomed	right	in.	The	four	figures	hove	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">view.	Peterson	squinted	and	blinked,	not	quite	believing	his	eyes.	“Isn’t	that…?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	couldn’t	be,	could	it?”	added	Jack,	leaning	closer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 most	 definitely	 is,”	 Peterson	 said,	 shaking	 his	 head.	 He	 lifted	 the	 grey-green	 handset	 to	 his	 lips	 and	 said,	 “Jenkins,	 let	 the	 XO	 know	 that	 we	 have	 a miss.	 Repeat,	 we	 have	 a	 miss.	 Briggs	 is	 still	 alive,	 and	 it	 looks	 like	 he’s	 got	 a new	friend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 didn’t	 even	 know	 those	 two	 knew	 each	 other.	 Perhaps	 they’ve	 been	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">league	all	this	time?”	said	Jack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	camera	zoomed	in	further	and	sure	enough,	standing	next	to	Briggs	was</p>

<p class="calibre1">to	 get	 her	 bearings	 as	 memories	 from	 the	 last	 few	 days	 came	 slowly	 back	 into focus.	The	trip	to	Osborne	House,	the	dinner,	Peterson	and	Armstrong’s	speech, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 sense	 of	 renewed	 hope	 for	 the	 future.	 Then	 Briggs	 had	 taken	 that	 all	 away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kidnapped,	 imprisoned,	 forsaken.	 Alone	 again.	 She	 was	 a	 survivor	 though, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t	she?	She’d	survived	worse	than	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	surroundings	were	relatively	spartan,	bare	stone	walls	cold	to	the	touch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 simple	 chair	 and	 table	 nestled	 under	 a	 bare	 timber-framed	 window,	 which looked	 down	 over	 the	 ruins	 of	 an	 unfamiliar	 castle.	 In	 the	 foreground	 were	 a small	chapel	and	courtyard,	ornamental	gardens	and	high	stone	walls	covered	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">moss	and	lichen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	been	brought	here	under	cover	of	darkness,	hooded	for	most	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">journey.	 Disoriented,	 she	 was	 unsure	 where	 exactly	 she	 was	 on	 the	 island.	 Her best	 guess	 was	 that	 this	 was	 Carisbrooke	 Castle	 as	 she	 could	 think	 of	 no	 other site	 of	 this	 scale	 or	 grandeur.	 It	 also	 fitted	 the	 bill,	 based	 on	 what	 she	 knew	 of Briggs	 and	 his	 men.	 They	 had	 been	 incarcerated	 in	 Parkhurst	 Prison,	 no	 more than	a	couple	of	miles	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 stretched	 out	 her	 arms,	 ran	 through	 a	 few	 warm-up	 stretches	 and	 yoga positions	to	stimulate	her	circulation	and	stop	the	shivering.	It	took	a	few	painful minutes	to	eliminate	the	stiffness	she	felt	in	her	lower	back	and	arms.	Staring	out the	 window,	 a	 light	 drizzle	 flecked	 the	 windows	 from	 rain	 clouds	 blowing	 in from	the	sea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	heard	footsteps	in	the	corridor	and	the	rattle	of	keys	as	the	door	swung</p>
<p class="calibre1">inwards	 and	 one	 of	 Briggs’s	 most	 trusted	 men	 stood	 waiting	 to	 take	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">downstairs	for	another	audience	with	the	man	himself.	Her	escort	was	a	curious-</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking	 individual.	 The	 facial	 tattoos	 that	 decorated	 one	 side	 of	 his	 head reminded	her	of	a	Maori	warrior.	His	beard	and	sideburns	were	in	need	of	a	good</p>
<p class="calibre1">trim,	with	only	a	small	tuft	of	hair	at	the	scalp.	The	rest	of	his	head	was	shaved</p>
<p class="calibre1">smooth.	Nevertheless,	despite	his	radical	appearance,	he	seemed	cordial	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terra	had	been	pleasantly	surprised	by	Briggs’s	behaviour	towards	her	so	far. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	been	kind	and	attentive,	asking	her	repeatedly	what	she	needed	to	make</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p220"></a>her	 stay	 comfortable.	 His	 men	 had	 returned	 several	 hours	 later	 after	 an exhaustive	search	of	Newport.	They	brought	clothes	that	were	several	sizes	too</p>
<p class="calibre1">big,	 together	 with	 expensive	 toiletries,	 the	 likes	 of	 which	 she	 had	 not	 seen	 in years.	He	had	insisted	she	wear	a	particular	dress,	the	yellow	one,	knee-length, </p>
<p class="calibre1">classic	style	with	the	floral	pattern.	The	autumnal	yellow	of	the	dress	set	off	her red	hair	in	the	sunlight.	Apparently,	the	dress	reminded	him	of	a	special	someone</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	had	known	long	ago,	and	this	seemed	to	put	him	in	a	good	mood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	escort	knocked	but	didn’t	wait	to	be	invited	in.	Briggs	was	in	the	middle</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	an	angry	exchange	with	another	prisoner	whose	hands	were	bound	behind	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">back.	 She	 recognised	 the	 man	 from	 Osborne	 House	 but	 didn’t	 know	 his	 name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	in	his	mid	to	late	fifties	with	a	full	head	of	white	blonde	hair.	A	large	cut had	 been	 patched	 up	 above	 his	 left	 eye,	 a	 purple	 bruise	 darkening	 underneath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	exchanged	a	pained	look	of	sympathy	before	he	was	led	away.	He	tried	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">say	something	to	her,	straining	against	the	rope	binding	his	wrist	but	was	quickly</p>
<p class="calibre1">pulled	away.	As	the	door	slammed	shut	behind	him,	she	heard	him	shout	“Don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell	them	anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Briggs’s	expression	softened	as	soon	as	he	spotted	Terra.	He	threw	his	arms</p>
<p class="calibre1">wide,	beaming.	“Good	morning,	Terra.	How	fares	our	Queen	of	Hurst	this	rainy</p>
<p class="calibre1">day?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	thank	you,”	responded	Terra	awkwardly,	maintaining	her	distance.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">great	 hall	 made	 her	 think	 of	 Hurst,	 though	 the	 castle	 was	 clearly	 much	 older judging	 by	 the	 roof	 and	 brickwork.	 It	 reminded	 her	 in	 so	 many	 ways	 of	 the historic	places	she	had	visited	as	a	child.	The	Tower	of	London,	Hampton	Court, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Windsor	Castle.	The	musty	smell,	the	damp	and	cold,	but	also	the	sense	of	awe</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 wonder	 at	 standing	 somewhere	 so	 rich	 in	 history.	 It	 was	 almost	 as	 if	 she could	 sense	 the	 ghosts	 of	 kings,	 queens	 and	 noblemen	 who	 had	 graced	 these royal	 surroundings.	 There	 was	 a	 very	 real	 aura	 of	 history	 and	 drama	 that impregnated	 every	 stone,	 every	 brick.	 One	 could	 not	 help	 but	 feel	 a	 little	 bit inadequate	 and	 unworthy	 standing	 there	 amongst	 these	 magnificent</p>
<p class="calibre1">surroundings.	The	incongruity	of	Briggs	and	his	men’s	occupation	of	the	castle</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	not	lost	on	Terra. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	and	sit	and	have	some	breakfast	with	me.”	He	studied	Terra,	trying	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">anticipate	what	would	make	her	happy.	“Hatch,	bring	us	some	coffee,	and	I	think</p>
<p class="calibre1">cereal	and	fruit	today,	am	I	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	 you,”	 responded	 Terra,	 modestly	 taking	 her	 seat	 opposite	 Briggs, </p>
<p class="calibre1">aware	of	his	attentions.	He	couldn’t	seem	to	take	his	eyes	off	her,	like	a	kid	with a	 new	 toy,	 enjoying	 the	 shape	 of	 the	 dress	 and	 the	 way	 its	 cut	 accentuated	 her curves.	 He	 watched,	 absorbed	 by	 her	 every	 move	 as	 she	 helped	 herself	 to	 an apple,	 which	 she	 cut	 carefully	 into	 slices	 and	 ate	 one	 by	 one.	 When	 she	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p221"></a>finished,	 he	 asked	 for	 the	 plates	 to	 be	 cleared	 before	 restarting	 his	 inquisition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	no	artifice,	no	subterfuge,	no	threat,	albeit	implied,	to	his	questions, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	she	willingly	complied,	answering	his	every	request	with	a	directness	that	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">found	refreshing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	why	don’t	we	go	back	to	where	we	left	off	last	night?	You	were	telling</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	all	about	Jack	and	Zed.	Where	are	my	notes?”	He	rummaged	through	a	pile</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	papers	in	front	of	him	and	pulled	out	a	sheet	of	lined	paper.	The	handwriting</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	childlike,	accompanied	by	doodles	and	scribbles	in	the	margins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	I’ve	got	here	that	your	friend	Zed	likes	to	carry	around	a	double-headed</p>
<p class="calibre1">axe.	Who	does	he	think	he	is?	Spartacus?	Bit	cumbersome,	isn’t	it?”	He	turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">towards	 his	 henchmen	 standing	 nearby	 and	 laughed	 bawdily.	 Turning	 back	 to Terra,	 without	 a	 hint	 of	 irony,	 he	 went	 on,	 “I	 prefer	 a	 butcher’s	 knife	 myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More	 up	 close	 and	 personal.”	 He	 crudely	 gestured	 a	 slice	 across	 his	 neck	 to demonstrate	 how	 he	 liked	 to	 use	 it,	 prompting	 another	 laugh	 from	 his	 men.	 “I look	forward	to	meeting	him.	Sounds	like	my	kind	of	guy.	I	might	put	his	head</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	a	spike	outside	my	castle	as	a	reminder	to	any	other	jumped-up	wide	boy	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinks	they	can	mess	with	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,	 Briggs…”	 She	 paused,	 a	 little	 embarrassed.	 “Can	 I	 call	 you	 Briggs?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 nodded	 and	 encouraged	 her	 to	 continue.	 “As	 I	 assured	 you	 yesterday,	 the people	 of	 Hurst	 had	 nothing	 to	 do	 with	 the	 attack	 on	 your	 convoy.	 They’re mostly	 pacifists.	 They	 spend	 their	 time	 fishing	 and	 growing	 vegetables,	 not fighting.	They’re	not	looking	for	trouble.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bullshit.	 Anyone	 who’s	 in	 league	 with	 the	 Americans	 is	 no	 pacifist.	 The missile	 or	 bomb	 that	 killed	 my	 men	 may	 have	 been	 American,	 but	 you	 can	 be sure	that	someone	from	Hurst	helped	pull	the	trigger.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 leaned	 forward,	 her	 eyebrow	 raised	 playfully.	 She	 felt	 composed	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Briggs’s	company,	demure,	playing	along.	She	knew	from	last	night	that	Briggs</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	a	weakness	for	her.	She	suspected	he	was	more	than	a	little	bit	susceptible	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	charms.	She	intended	to	use	every	advantage	that	gave	her,	without	crossing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	line.	The	bruise	on	her	left	cheek	ached	when	she	moved	her	jaw,	a	reminder</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	you	could	push	him	only	so	far. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Briggs	had	expressed	his	regret	immediately	and	the	man	who	struck	her	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 been	 seen	 again.	 She	 remained	 unintimidated	 by	 the	 threat	 of	 further violence,	though	not	oblivious	to	the	danger.	She	was	deliberately	provocative, </p>
<p class="calibre1">working	hard	to	retain	his	attention.	She	wasn’t	sure	how	much	Briggs	had	heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 plan	 for	 Camp	 Wight,	 but	 it	 wouldn’t	 hurt	 to	 test	 the	 extent	 of	 his knowledge	and	spread	a	little	disinformation	at	the	same	time	to	downplay	Hurst</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	create	a	degree	of	separation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	assure	you	the	Americans	want	little	to	do	with	Hurst.	It’s	an	outpost, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p222"></a>nothing	 more.	 They	 have	 no	 appreciation	 of	 history.	 No	 real	 understanding	 of local	 politics.	 Like	 a	 bull	 in	 a	 china	 shop,	 they’re,	 well,	 just	 doing	 what Americans	 do	 best.	 Throwing	 their	 weight	 around,	 sticking	 their	 noses	 in	 to other	people’s	business.	Trying	to	do	the	right	thing,	but	in	the	process,	treading on	a	lot	of	toes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	 Terra.	 If	 you’re	 so	 bleeding	 clever,	 what	 would	 your	 counsel	 be?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">asked	Briggs,	in	a	moment	of	indulgence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled	and	Briggs	looked	at	her	suspiciously,	his	head	tilted	to	the	side	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	he	was	torn	between	wanting	to	believe	her	and	beating	her	to	a	pulp.	She	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">under	no	illusion	that	the	moment	she	ceased	to	please	and	beguile	him,	her	life</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	be	expendable.	Careful,	Terra,	she	told	herself.	Be	very	careful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 leaned	 forward	 and	 fixed	 him	 with	 her	 most	 winning	 smile.	 “If	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Americans	want	to	set	up	camp	here,	let	them.”	She	shrugged	and	looked	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 shoulder.	 “Wait	 until	 they’ve	 ferried	 over	 their	 supplies	 and	 stores,	 got everything	 set	 up.	 Bide	 your	 time.	 What	 harm	 can	 it	 do?	 If	 you	 risk	 an	 all-out war	 with	 them,	 you’ll	 lose.	 Remember	 the	 war	 on	 terror?	 Remember	 what</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened	 to	 every	 army	 that	 invaded	 Afghanistan	 or	 Iraq	 or	 Syria	 and	 tried	 to fight	the	Taliban,	ISIS	or	Al	Qaeda	in	a	conventional	way?	They	all	failed.	You</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 do	 worse	 than	 learn	 from	 their	 experience.	 Your	 men	 need	 to	 become invisible,	 like	 shadows	 in	 the	 night.	 Go	 underground,	 become	 fifth	 columnists, fill	 every	 position	 of	 power.	 Bide	 your	 time,	 like	 sleepers	 waiting	 for	 the	 right moment	to	strike,	when	the	allies	are	at	their	most	vulnerable.”	She	leaned	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">again,	her	smile	gone.	“Anyway,	that’s	what	I	would	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Interesting.	 You	 and	 I	 think	 alike.	 Terra,	 you	 might	 just	 make	 a	 name	 for yourself	 around	 here.	 I	 need	 a	 good	 adviser,	 someone	 I	 can	 trust.	 I’m	 just	 not sure	 I	 can	 trust	 you,	 Terra.	 For	 a	 start,	 you’re	 a	 woman.	 Never	 trust	 a	 woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	what	my	mum	used	to	say,	God	bless	her.	Every	woman	I’ve	ever	known</p>
<p class="calibre1">has	lied	or	cheated	on	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 stood	 up	 and	 leaned	 across	 the	 table,	 over	 the	 fruit	 bowl	 that	 had	 been placed	between	them.	He	picked	up	a	ripe	peach,	biting	down	to	the	stone	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">tearing	away	its	flesh,	allowing	the	juice	to	dribble	down	his	chin.	He	wiped	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">liquid	away	with	his	sleeve	and	grinned	lasciviously	at	Terra. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	 course,	 if	 you	 could	 prove	 to	 me	 that	 I	 could	 trust	 you,	 that	 would	 be different.	 But	 right	 now,	 my	 head	 is	 full	 of	 questions	 about	 you,	 Terra. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Questions,	questions.	You’re	going	to	have	to	earn	my	trust.	Do	we	understand</p>
<p class="calibre1">each	other?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terra	swallowed	involuntarily,	her	mouth	and	throat	suddenly	dry.	She	knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">exactly	what	he	meant.	She	was	beginning	to	ask	herself	what	she	was	going	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 to	 do	 to	 keep	 Hurst	 safe	 and	 her	 enemies	 close.	 She	 had	 started	 down	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p223"></a>very	 dangerous	 path	 and	 it	 was	 already	 too	 late	 to	 turn	 back	 without consequences.	The	only	way	was	forward,	deeper	and	deeper	into	the	maze,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	wrong	turn	could	prove	terminal. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p224"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Fifty-three</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	reversed	the	Land	Rover	Defender	up	to	the	main	entrance	to	the	Chewton</p>
<p class="calibre1">Glen	hotel	and	opened	the	boot	for	Mila	to	load	the	rest	of	their	gear.	Other	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">minor	 burns	 and	 watery	 blisters	 on	 her	 fingers	 and	 forearm,	 Riley	 had	 nothing more	to	show	for	her	suicidal	dash	through	a	burning	building	than	some	singed</p>
<p class="calibre1">hair	and	scorch	marks	on	her	trousers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	hurried	back	into	the	lobby	area	and	helped	Zed	to	his	feet,	levering	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	from	a	large	leather	sofa	where	he	had	been	playing	cards	with	Adele.	One	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 guards	 kept	 watch	 on	 the	 Hurst	 group	 as	 they	 manhandled	 Zed	 across	 the gravel	 driveway	 to	 the	 Defender’s	 front	 passenger	 seat.	 He	 swung	 his	 legs	 up over	 the	 sill	 and	 slumped	 back	 against	 the	 headrest,	 beads	 of	 sweat	 already forming	on	his	brow.	He	was	slowly	getting	his	strength	back,	but	the	strain	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">clear	for	all	to	see.	He	masked	his	pain	well,	but	Riley	knew	him	better	than	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 fooled	 so	 easily.	 It	 would	 be	 a	 while	 yet	 before	 he	 was	 back	 to	 his	 normal world-weary	laconic	self. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 Joe	 gone	 and	 Zed	 on	 the	 road	 to	 recovery,	 there	 was	 nothing	 left	 for them	here.	Riley	was	desperate	now	to	get	back	to	Hurst.	Despite	the	efforts	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 whole	 group	 to	 persuade	 her	 otherwise,	 Stella	 was	 adamant	 that	 she	 was staying	put	at	the	hotel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 gave	 Stella	 a	 long	 farewell	 hug	 before	 stepping	 back	 to	 look	 into	 her eyes.	 They	 were	 already	 welling	 with	 tears.	 She	 held	 her	 shoulders	 at	 arm’s length. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	sure	this	is	what	you	want,	Stella?	I	know	these	are	your	friends.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	that.	But	living	here	in	this	convent…”	Her	voice	trailed	off.	“You	know	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t	have	to	live	like	this,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 sun	 appeared	 from	 behind	 a	 cloud,	 blinding	 the	 group	 with	 brilliant</p>
<p class="calibre1">sunshine.	 Stella	 squinted	 back,	 irradiated	 by	 the	 light.	 To	 Riley,	 she	 looked almost	angelic,	her	flawless	skin	seemed	to	shimmer.	Through	her	tears,	Stella’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">passion	and	conviction	was	clear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	explain	it.	I	just	feel	like	I	belong	here.	You	have	to	see	beyond	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sisterhood	with	all	their	rules	and	religion.	The	way	of	life	they	are	espousing	is pure.	It’s	what	I	want,	Riley.	I	think	all	of	us	secretly	crave	that	simplicity,	don’t we?	A	life	with	purpose	and	structure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p225"></a>“Sometimes,	 it’s	 not	 that	 simple.	 But	 listen,	 if	 you	 tell	 me	 that	 this	 is	 what you	really	want,	then	I	won’t	try	and	dissuade	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	do,	Riley.	I	really	do.”	She	paused,	looking	at	her	shoes	and	then	back	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 hotel	 and	 the	 trees	 beyond,	 composing	 her	 thoughts,	 choosing	 her	 words carefully.	 “I	 know	 you	 think	 that	 this	 whole	 place	 is	 false,	 that	 it’s	 not sustainable.	 That	 we’re	 all	 burying	 our	 heads	 in	 the	 sand	 and	 ignoring	 what’s going	 on	 in	 the	 real	 world	 out	 there,	 but	 I’ve	 made	 my	 choice.	 Please	 respect that.	I	don’t	want	to	go	back	out	there.	I’m	safe	here	now.	I	don’t	have	to	wake</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	and	worry	about	where	my	next	meal	is	coming	from.	I’m	tired	of	living	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">fear,	 of	 watching	 my	 back	 all	 the	 time.	 Life	 here	 is	 pure	 and	 simple,	 free	 of violence	and	struggle.	I	like	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	is	survival	enough?	It’s	up	to	us	all	to	help	rebuild	what’s	out	there,”	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">said,	pointing	beyond	the	wall.	“Don’t	you	want	to	be	part	of	that,	to	play	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">part?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Honestly…?”	 Stella	 scrunched	 up	 her	 face.	 “No.	 I’d	 prefer	 to	 live	 out	 my life	right	here.”	She	patted	her	belly,	which	was	just	beginning	to	show	signs	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">swelling.	Though	anyone	who	didn’t	know	she	was	pregnant	would	have	a	hard</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	 spotting	 it.	 “I’ve	 got	 another	 life	 to	 think	 about	 now.	 I	 need	 a	 safe environment	to	bring	up	my	baby,	and	the	sisters	can	give	me	that.	It’s	not	much, </p>
<p class="calibre1">maybe,	but	it’s	enough	for	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	smiled	and	hugged	her	again.	“I’m	happy	for	you,	really	I	am.	I’ll	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	and	see	you	as	soon	as	I	can.	We	all	will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 they	 were	 talking,	 the	 nurse	 appeared	 in	 the	 doorway	 holding	 Adele’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand.	 The	 little	 girl	 let	 go	 of	 the	 nurse’s	 hand	 and	 ran	 towards	 them,	 a	 small rucksack	bouncing	on	her	back.	She	attached	herself	to	Stella	and	Riley,	hugging</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	both,	before	heading	towards	the	Land	Rover	with	a	dismissive	wave	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 shoulder.	 She	 slammed	 the	 car	 door	 and	 pressed	 her	 face	 to	 the	 window, looking	back	at	Stella,	her	hot	little	breaths	misting	up	the	glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 were	 voices	 behind	 them,	 footsteps	 crunching	 on	 the	 gravel.	 A	 small posse	 of	 women	 rounded	 the	 corner	 of	 the	 building,	 walking	 swiftly	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">purposefully	 towards	 them.	 Sister	 Theodora	 was	 at	 the	 head	 of	 the	 group, flanked	by	the	two	other	sisters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 there!	 Yes,	 you.”	 She	 jabbed	 her	 finger	 accusingly	 at	 Riley,	 her	 voice shrill	and	contorted.	She	reminded	Riley	of	the	Wicked	Witch	of	the	West	in	 <i class="calibre4">The</i> <i class="calibre4">Wizard	of	Oz</i>,	all	dressed	in	black.	All	she	was	missing	was	a	green	face,	pointy hat	and	long	nose.	Right	now,	Riley	wished	she	had	a	good	bucket	of	water	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">throw	at	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Mother	Superior	came	to	a	halt	right	in	front	of	Riley,	breathing	heavily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 pointed	 directly	 at	 Riley	 and	 bellowed,	 “Seize	 them	 and	 take	 her	 into</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p226"></a>custody.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	 of	 the	 guards	 grabbed	 Riley	 from	 behind,	 forcing	 her	 arm	 behind	 her back	before	she	had	time	to	react.	Mila	raced	round	to	wrestle	with	the	woman, </p>
<p class="calibre1">ripping	 her	 hand	 from	 Riley’s	 arm,	 releasing	 the	 pressure	 momentarily.	 “Get your	hands	off	her!”	The	guard	pushed	Mila	out	the	way	and	twisted	Riley’s	arm</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	into	a	lock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	all	right,	Mila,”	said	Riley	through	clenched	teeth.	She	stared	back	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sisters	defiantly,	ignoring	the	pain	for	a	second.	“Perhaps	you’d	be	so	good	as	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell	me	what	I’m	being	accused	of?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 have	 reason	 to	 believe	 that	 the	 fire	 was	 no	 accident.”	 She	 enunciated each	syllable	of	the	word	“accident”	slowly	and	with	particular	emphasis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley’s	 mind	 was	 racing.	 Why	 would	 anyone	 have	 started	 the	 fire</p>
<p class="calibre1">deliberately?	 For	 what	 possible	 reason?	 She	 suddenly	 thought	 of	 Joe	 and	 their escape.	Could	the	two	events	be	connected?	But	how?	From	the	way	the	sisters</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 behaving,	 they	 clearly	 had	 evidence	 that	 supported	 this	 conclusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although	she	had	no	idea	why	she	was	implicated	in	all	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Considering	 you	 had	 all	 of	 us	 locked	 up	 when	 the	 fire	 broke	 out,	 I	 find	 it highly	unlikely	that	you	could	think	we	had	anything	to	do	with	it,”	said	Riley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	 it	 was	 purely	 coincidence	 that	 your	 friend	 escapes	 on	 the	 same	 night	 a fire	breaks	out?”	mocked	the	sister.	“Rather	convenient,	wouldn’t	you	say?	We</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	have	your	word	that	you	were	where	you	say	you	were	when	the	alarm	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">raised.	 Did	 anyone	 see	 you?	 Can	 anyone	 corroborate	 your	 version	 of	 events?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shook	her	head,	not	waiting	for	an	answer.	“I	thought	not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	tried	to	wriggle	her	arm	free	of	the	guard’s	grasp.	She	had	terrible	pins</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	needles,	but	the	guard	only	twisted	her	arm	tighter	to	stop	her	fidgeting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 sister	 seemed	 to	 enjoy	 her	 discomfort	 and	 continued.	 “There	 were	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">witnesses.	You	could	have	smashed	the	garden	window	any	time	that	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hold	 on	 a	 minute,	 you	 left	 us	 in	 there.	 Your	 guard	 locked	 the	 door.	 What else	were	we	meant	to	do?	Stay	there	and	die	of	asphyxiation?	Zed	would	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">died	 too	 had	 we	 not	 acted	 when	 we	 did.	 Anyway,	 why	 would	 anyone</p>
<p class="calibre1">deliberately	start	a	fire	and	be	responsible	for	the	murder	of	so	many?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	 indeed?”	 Sister	 Theodora	 let	 the	 question	 air	 for	 a	 few	 seconds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Unless	they	were	trying	to	help	their	friend.	We	hold	you	and	your	party	fully</p>
<p class="calibre1">responsible.	Those	deaths	are	squarely	on	Hurst’s	shoulders.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	preposterous.	So	you’re	saying	that	you	have	no	other	suspects?	Are</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	the	other	residents	accounted	for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sister	 Theodora	 whipped	 her	 head	 round	 at	 the	 other	 sisters.	 It	 seemed	 a reasonable	question,	but	in	her	mind,	there	was	only	one	plausible	explanation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 held	 the	 roll	 call	 this	 morning,	 Sister	 Imelda.	 Are	 all	 the	 residents</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p227"></a>accounted	for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sister	 Mel	 hesitated.	 Suddenly	 she	 looked	 uncomfortable,	 a	 seed	 of	 doubt</p>
<p class="calibre1">germinating	rapidly	in	her	mind.	“All	residents	were	accounted	for,	sister.	Except</p>
<p class="calibre1">one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sister	Theodora	looked	irritated	by	this	disclosure,	disappointed	that	no	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	thought	to	mention	this	detail	earlier.	“And	you	waited	until	now	to	inform</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	of	this?	Well,	go	on,	sister.	Who	was	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 one	 of	 the	 girls,	 sister.	 Jean	 Farley.	 She’s	 been	 taking	 food	 to	 the prisoners	 every	 day.	 It’s	 possible…”	 She	 looked	 down	 at	 the	 ground,	 afraid	 of the	consequences	of	what	she	was	about	to	say.	“It’s	possible	that	she	could	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">helped	the	men	escape.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nonsense.	Why	would	she	do	such	a	thing?	No,	I	refuse	to	believe	that	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	our	own	could…”	Her	voice	trailed	off.	“I	have	every	confidence	that	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 group	 from	 Hurst	 who	 are	 responsible	 for	 this	 outrage,	 not	 one	 of	 our	 own girls.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 shook	 her	 head.	 “You	 believe	 what	 you	 like,	 but	 I’m	 telling	 you,	 my group	had	nothing	to	do	with	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	propose	we	take	them	all	into	custody	until	the	truth	can	be	determined.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	gestured	for	the	two	guards	to	tie	their	hands	behind	their	backs,	but	Riley</p>
<p class="calibre1">wriggled	free.	In	one	fluid	movement,	she	pulled	a	concealed	blade	from	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	belt	buckle	and	held	it	out	in	front	of	her.	There	was	no	way	they	were	going</p>
<p class="calibre1">quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stella	 stepped	 forward	 and	 tried	 to	 intercede	 on	 behalf	 of	 the	 Hurst	 group, placing	her	hand	lightly	on	the	guard’s	shoulder.	Sensing	Stella’s	approach,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">guard	 swung	 round	 wildly	 with	 her	 elbow,	 striking	 Stella	 hard	 across	 the	 face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	blow	left	a	red	welt	that	took	Stella’s	breath	away.	She	gasped	in	pain,	as	the guard	stuttered	an	apology.	Sister	Mel	rushed	to	her	side	to	comfort	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	sharp	wolf	whistle	from	the	Land	Rover	silenced	the	group	and	they	turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 one	 to	 find	 Zed,	 index	 finger	 and	 thumb	 to	 his	 lips.	 In	 the	 other	 hand,	 he clutched	a	shotgun	resting	the	barrel	on	his	hip,	pointing	squarely	at	the	nearest</p>
<p class="calibre1">guard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	everyone	settle	down,	shall	we.” </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
Zed	 had	 watched	 the	 arrival	 of	 the	 Sisterhood	 from	 inside	 the	 vehicle	 with	 a weary	shake	of	the	head	and	guessed	what	would	happen	next.	He	had	retrieved<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">the	shotgun	from	its	hiding	place	strapped	under	the	front	passenger	seat	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	liked	to	keep	it,	in	case	of	trouble. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p228"></a>Using	the	tailgate	to	support	himself	he	kept	both	guards	in	his	field	of	view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 feeling	 a	 little	 shaky,	 sweat	 beading	 on	 his	 upper	 lip,	 despite	 the	 cool ambient	 temperature.	 He	 was	 trying	 his	 damnedest	 to	 look	 like	 he	 meant</p>
<p class="calibre1">business.	 Riley	 and	 Mila	 distanced	 themselves	 from	 the	 two	 guards,	 acutely aware	 that	 he	 might	 lose	 his	 grip	 on	 the	 tailgate	 and	 topple	 sideways	 at	 any moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	two.	Lay	down	your	weapons	and	back	away.	No	one	needs	to	get	hurt</p>
<p class="calibre1">here,”	said	Zed,	his	voice	thin	but	authoritative. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sister	 Theodora	 stared	 back	 at	 Zed,	 motionless.	 With	 a	 heavy	 sigh,	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1">conceded	 defeat,	 signalling	 for	 the	 guards	 to	 lay	 their	 rifles	 on	 the	 ground	 and take	two	steps	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 have	 our	 word	 that	 none	 of	 us	 had	 anything	 to	 do	 with	 the	 fire,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">continued	Zed.	“Anyone	who	believes	otherwise	is	even	crazier	than	I	thought.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 adjusted	 his	 grip	 on	 the	 tailgate	 and	 nearly	 fell	 before	 recovering.	 Mila hurried	over	and	slid	a	supporting	shoulder	under	his	arm,	taking	the	gun	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 shaking	 hand.	 She	 tilted	 her	 head	 and	 peered	 down	 the	 barrel,	 training	 the sights	on	the	two	sisters,	who	shifted	uneasily,	their	hands	half-raised	in	alarm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	going	to	happen	next,”	confirmed	Zed	confidently,	“is	that	we	are	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	to	get	in	our	car,	drive	right	out	of	here	and	you’re	not	going	to	try	to	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything	to	stop	us.	Are	we	clear?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	repeated,	inclining	his	head,	“Are	we	clear?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 are	 clear,”	 echoed	 Sister	 Theodora.	 “May	 God	 have	 mercy	 on	 you	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	you	what	you	have	done.	All	of	you	have	blood	on	your	hands.	All	of	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can	believe	what	you	like.	It	doesn’t	make	it	true,”	said	Riley	defiantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 climbed	 into	 the	 driver’s	 seat	 and	 inserted	 the	 key	 in	 the	 ignition, looking	 back	 at	 Zed	 and	 Mila	 in	 the	 rear-view	 mirror,	 just	 standing	 there, showing	no	signs	of	moving.	Mila	let	out	a	deep	sigh,	like	she	had	been	holding</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 breath	 all	 this	 time	 and	 lowered	 the	 shotgun	 towards	 the	 ground.	 Mila motioned	towards	Stella.	“You	staying	or	coming	with	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stella	 was	 still	 nursing	 her	 cheek,	 where	 the	 guard	 had	 struck	 her,	 tears streaming	down	her	face.	She	studied	Adele’s	and	Riley’s	imploring	looks	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">inside	the	vehicle,	forcing	a	smile.	“Thanks,	but	this	is	my	home	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sister	 Mel	 put	 an	 arm	 around	 Stella’s	 shoulders,	 squeezing	 her	 tighter	 in	 a show	 of	 solidarity.	 Mila	 clambered	 into	 the	 vehicle	 and	 slammed	 the	 rear passenger	door,	resting	the	shotgun	on	the	open	window,	pointing	over	the	heads</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	group.	Riley	started	the	Land	Rover’s	engine,	which	coughed	into	life,	its</p>
<p class="calibre1">exhaust	rattling,	wheezing	a	little	before	finding	its	rhythm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	one	of	you	would	be	good	enough	to	get	that	truck	out	of	my	way,” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p229"></a>shouted	Riley	over	the	noise	of	the	engine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 guard	 hurried	 inside	 to	 find	 the	 keys	 to	 the	 truck	 hanging	 on	 a	 hook behind	the	front	desk.	As	she	walked	down	the	gravel	driveway,	the	Land	Rover</p>
<p class="calibre1">kept	 pace,	 rolling	 a	 few	 yards	 behind	 her,	 back	 towards	 the	 front	 gate,	 its	 two pillars	with	ornamental	lions	mounted	either	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guard	reached	up	for	the	handle	and	heaved	herself	up	into	the	cab.	With</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 plume	 of	 diesel	 smoke	 from	 its	 roof	 mounted	 exhaust,	 the	 truck	 roared	 into life.	 Inside	 they	 could	 see	 the	 driver	 fighting	 with	 the	 gear	 stick	 to	 get	 the lumbering	beast	into	reverse,	before	lurching	slowly	backwards.	She	revved	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">engine	 impatiently,	 allowing	 just	 enough	 space	 for	 them	 to	 drive	 out	 and	 on	 to the	main	road	beyond,	before	rolling	back	into	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	before	the	gap	closed	behind	them,	Zed	glimpsed	Stella’s	lone	arm	raised</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	farewell	in	the	rear-view	mirror,	and	then	she	was	gone.	He	had	a	bad	feeling</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	wasn’t	the	last	time	they	would	tangle	with	the	Sisterhood. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p230"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Fifty-four</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 less	 than	 five	 miles	 back	 to	 Hurst	 from	 the	 hotel,	 but	 the	 roads	 were virtually	impassable,	clogged	with	abandoned	cars.	The	traffic	backed	up	all	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	from	the	roundabout	on	the	edge	of	town	along	the	coastal	road	they	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempting	to	navigate.	They	had	no	choice	but	to	detour	around	obstacles,	onto</p>
<p class="calibre1">pavements,	grass	verges,	through	people’s	front	gardens,	even	smash	through	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">garden	 fence.	 In	 doing	 so,	 they	 managed	 to	 hook	 a	 children’s	 climbing	 frame, wrapping	the	ladder	around	their	front	grill.	They	had	to	stop	to	prevent	it	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">jamming	 in	 the	 front	 wheel	 arch.	 They	 used	 any	 means	 they	 could	 to	 pass	 the blockages	that	littered	the	roadway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	a	couple	of	places,	they	had	to	nudge	other	vehicles	out	of	the	way,	or	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	and	push	them	by	hand.	Riley	had	grown	desensitised	to	the	sight	of	death.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 all	 around	 them.	 She	 thought	 nothing	 of	 pulling	 corpses	 from	 vehicles,	 of wrenching	 victim’s	 hands	 that	 still	 gripped	 steering	 wheels,	 or	 heads	 resting against	 dashboards.	 She	 no	 longer	 felt	 squeamish,	 or	 was	 it	 just	 fatigue? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cumulative	 tiredness	 played	 tricks	 on	 the	 mind.	 She	 reached	 over	 a	 body	 to release	the	hand	brake	and	steer	a	two-seater	sports	car	out	of	their	way,	as	Mila</p>
<p class="calibre1">pushed	from	behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 a	 couple	 of	 hours,	 they	 caught	 their	 first	 glimpse	 of	 the	 sea.	 Milford beach	 stretched	 out	 to	 the	 east	 of	 them	 with	 the	 Needles	 rocks	 and	 island beyond.	 Riley	 was	 still	 troubled	 by	 what	 Stella’s	 friend	 had	 told	 her.	 She	 had been	very	clear.	She	had	seen	smoke	rising	from	Hurst	Castle.	However	unlikely, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that’s	what	she	said.	Why	would	she	lie? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Visible	from	that	distance,	it	had	to	be	more	than	just	a	campfire	or	burning</p>
<p class="calibre1">rubbish.	It	sounded	like	a	proper	fire	that	had	got	completely	out	of	control.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagined	 the	 widespread	 panic,	 the	 plans	 and	 preparations	 they	 had	 made	 for exactly	this	eventuality.	They	had	stored	fire	hoses	in	the	lighthouse	for	pumping</p>
<p class="calibre1">water	 from	 the	 dock	 back	 into	 the	 castle	 and	 placed	 buckets	 of	 sand	 near doorways	 and	 access	 points	 around	 the	 camp.	 They	 were	 as	 prepared	 as	 they could	 be,	 so	 she	 was	 still	 wondering	 how	 a	 fire	 could	 have	 taken	 hold.	 Just thinking	about	fires	brought	back	memories	of	the	previous	night	when	she	put</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 life	 on	 the	 line	 to	 save	 Zed.	 The	 pain	 in	 her	 hand	 was	 a	 living	 link.	 She cradled	her	left	wrist,	still	bandaged,	pinching	the	dressing	to	relieve	the	pressure</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p231"></a>on	the	watery	blisters	that	were	painful	to	the	touch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	drove	on	through	Milford	village,	each	of	them	fearing	the	worst.	Riley</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaned	forward	in	her	seat,	anticipation	growing	as	they	drew	closer	to	home,	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagination	 running	 riot,	 giving	 voice	 to	 her	 fears.	 As	 they	 reached	 the	 end	 of the	road	and	the	last	of	the	buildings	at	the	far	edge	of	town,	they	screeched	to	a halt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ahead	of	them	was	a	dirt	track	that	hugged	the	start	of	the	raised	man-made</p>
<p class="calibre1">sea	defences	and	shingle	spit.	To	their	left	was	what	remained	of	a	caravan	park, </p>
<p class="calibre1">half	 flooded	 and	 storm	 damaged.	 Ploughed	 fields	 lay	 beyond.	 In	 the	 corner	 of the	field,	sitting	next	to	a	broken	wooden	fence,	a	yellow	tractor	stood	idle	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">abandoned	beneath	a	cluster	of	trees.	Riley	engaged	first	gear	and	they	continued</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	last	leg	of	their	journey	along	the	dirt	track	towards	the	castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 it	 was	 in	 the	 distance,	 across	 the	 estuary	 and	 tidal	 waters.	 There	 was little	 sign	 of	 smoke	 now,	 in	 fact,	 nothing	 that	 suggested	 anything	 untoward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	picked	up	the	pace,	pumping	the	accelerator	and	bumping	over	the	many</p>
<p class="calibre1">potholes,	deep	groves	and	dips,	where	the	dirt	track	was	waterlogged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	reached	the	end	of	the	track	and	ascended	the	steep	incline	in	low	gear, </p>
<p class="calibre1">slipping	and	sliding	until	they	crested	the	top	of	the	shingle	bank	and	the	vehicle levelled	out	again.	The	view	over	Christchurch	Bay	was	spectacular,	the	island</p>
<p class="calibre1">glinting	in	the	morning	sun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 braked	 hard,	 scattering	 stones	 in	 front	 of	 the	 car.	 She	 could	 barely believe	her	eyes.	She	reached	across	Zed,	fumbling	in	the	glove	compartment	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	binoculars.	It	took	a	couple	of	seconds	for	her	eyes	to	adjust	and	find	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	was	looking	for.	Far	out	to	sea	was	a	ship.	It	was	definitely	military,	a	navy</p>
<p class="calibre1">frigate	or	destroyer,	she	couldn’t	tell	from	this	distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	 ship?”	 asked	 Zed,	 peering	 into	 the	 distance,	 following	 the	 line	 of	 her binoculars	at	the	indistinct	grey	shape	on	the	horizon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Definitely	not	a	 steamer	or	container	 ship.	Could	be	 a	warship,”	suggested</p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it	one	of	ours?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hard	to	tell	but	it’s	definitely	heading	this	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 handed	 the	 binoculars	 to	 Zed	 and	 shifted	 the	 Land	 Rover	 back	 into gear.	She	accelerated	hard,	showering	the	underside	of	the	car	with	pebbles	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">loose	shingle.	There	was	now	an	added	urgency	to	get	to	where	they	were	going. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 panned	 the	 binoculars	 towards	 Hurst	 and	 pointed	 out	 that	 there	 was	 no lookout	on	the	castle	walls.	That	was	unusual.	Riley	made	a	mental	note	to	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">strong	words	with	whoever	was	on	guard	duty	that	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where	was	everyone?	The	whole	place	looked	deserted.	The	closer	they	got, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 more	 worried	 they	 became	 that	 something	 terrible	 had	 happened	 in	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p232"></a>absence.	Riley	cursed	herself	for	being	away	too	long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rounding	the	western	edge	of	the	fortifications,	they	headed	down	the	short</p>
<p class="calibre1">slope	 going	 too	 fast.	 Riley	 jammed	 on	 the	 brakes	 and	 the	 car	 slid	 to	 a	 halt outside	 the	 main	 entrance	 to	 the	 castle.	 All	 four	 doors	 flew	 open	 as	 the	 group emerged,	alert	and	ready.	In	front	of	them	was	the	blast	hole	in	the	drawbridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 could	 see	 wisps	 of	 smoke	 caressing	 the	 leading	 edge	 of	 the	 stone	 walls, before	dissipating	on	the	morning	breeze.	To	the	right	of	the	entrance,	high	up	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	old	grey	stone	walls,	mottled	with	black	lichen,	someone	had	spray-painted	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">tag	in	blood-red	graffiti.	Stylised	letters	a	metre	high	spelt	the	word:	“Hurts”. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mila	held	her	hand	over	her	mouth,	slowly	taking	in	the	scorch	marks	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	explosion	at	the	front	entrance	and	trying	to	make	sense	of	the	graffiti.	“Who</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	have	done	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Adele	spelt	out	the	letters	aloud,	one	by	one.	“What	does	it	mean,	Zed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	means	someone	has	a	sick	sense	of	humour.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 opened	 the	 tailgate	 and	 unloaded	 their	 weapons.	 She	 slid	 a	 pistol	 into her	 belt	 and	 rammed	 two	 shells	 into	 each	 barrel	 of	 the	 cocked	 shotgun.	 “You don’t	think	that	the	guys	from	the	hospital	had	anything	to	do	with	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 possible	 they	 came	 looking	 for	 us.”	 Zed	 stood	 scratching	 his	 beard, angling	his	head	to	the	side.	“Don’t	take	any	chances.”	He	sniffed.	“They	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	be	here.	Mila	and	Riley,	you	two	head	inside	and	see	what	you	can	find	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Be	careful,	yeah?	Adele,	you	stay	here	with	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 clambered	 through	 the	 blast	 hole	 and	 tiptoed	 through	 the	 covered</p>
<p class="calibre1">entrance,	staying	close	to	the	wall,	making	no	sound.	It	was	eerily	quiet	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 closed	 her	 eyes	 and	 took	 a	 couple	 of	 deep	 breaths.	 Mila	 was	 right	 behind her.	Very	slowly,	they	both	peered	around	the	corner	to	take	a	look	at	what	lay</p>
<p class="calibre1">beyond.	Inside,	bodies	littered	the	courtyard.	Mila	gasped,	her	eyes	flicking	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	body	to	the	next,	before	recognising	one	of	the	faces	furthest	from	her:	“Oh</p>
<p class="calibre1">no,	please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	heard	voices	close	by	and	froze,	gesturing	Mila	back	against	the	wall, </p>
<p class="calibre1">weapons	 raised	 trembling	 in	 front	 of	 them.	 She	 listened	 carefully,	 straining	 to hear,	 before	 recognising	 Tommy’s	 voice.	 She	 called	 out	 to	 him,	 warning	 the defenders	not	to	shoot.	Nathan	and	Liz	hurried	out	to	meet	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 God,	 where	 have	 you	 all	 been?	 We	 thought	 you	 were	 dead,”	 said</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nathan,	wide-eyed	in	disbelief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	long	story.	What	the	hell	happened	here?”	asked	Riley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	were	attacked	by	the	group	from	the	hospital,”	said	Nathan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 God,”	 she	 gasped,	 realising	 the	 chain	 of	 events	 they	 had	 set	 in	 motion several	 days	 before.	 “But	 how	 did	 they	 get	 in?	 What	 about	 the	 guards?”	 Riley had	a	dozen	questions	crowding	each	other	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p233"></a>“They	came	in	the	dead	of	night.	Used	climbing	gear	to	get	over	the	walls	at the	 back.	 Once	 they	 were	 inside	 they	 blew	 open	 the	 front	 gates.	 There	 was another	group	waiting	outside.	There	were	too	many	of	them.	We	mounted	a	last</p>
<p class="calibre1">stand	at	the	Gun	Tower.	It	was	bad,	Riley.	It	was	a	bloodbath	for	the	guys	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">west	wing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz	 took	 over	 and	 explained	 in	 detail	 what	 had	 happened.	 They	 helped	 Zed through	to	the	guardhouse	to	sit	down.	He	was	still	a	little	unsteady	on	his	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 bent	 down	 on	 one	 knee	 and	 shook	 Adele’s	 hand,	 welcoming	 her	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	castle.	She	looked	back	at	him	a	little	bashfully	and	cringed	as	he	ruffled	her hair.	She	shot	a	grumpy	glance	towards	Riley	as	if	to	say,	“Who	is	this	guy?	I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	a	kid,	you	know.” </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
Inside	the	main	building,	Riley	waved	at	Scottie	who	nodded	back,	wrapping	a<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">bandage	 round	 the	 scalp	 of	 one	 of	 the	 injured,	 whose	 dark	 Barbour	 jacket	 was slick	with	sticky	blood.	Only	his	eyes	and	the	lower	half	of	the	man’s	face	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">visible.	Liz	had	him	propped	against	the	wall	with	a	hot	cup	of	tea	to	hold.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	 to	 be	 suffering	 from	 concussion.	 He	 was	 non-responsive,	 almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">dejected.	There	was	an	air	of	melancholy	about	him.	In	truth,	no	one	was	quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">sure	how	he’d	got	there	at	all.	He	was	unarmed	and	had	nothing	identifiable	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 pockets.	 And	 yet,	 there	 was	 something	 familiar	 about	 him,	 but	 Scottie couldn’t	 quite	 place	 it.	 Something	 about	 his	 voice	 when	 he	 had	 asked	 for something	to	drink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 helped	 the	 injured	 man	 through	 to	 the	 makeshift	 triage	 area	 where</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	 than	 a	 dozen	 wounded	 were	 laid	 out	 on	 mattresses	 on	 the	 floor.	 One	 of Copper’s	 men	 was	 tied	 to	 a	 bed,	 a	 bullet	 still	 lodged	 in	 his	 abdomen,	 oozing blood	 when	 he	 breathed.	 They	 didn’t	 hold	 much	 hope	 for	 him	 but	 Liz	 had insisted	that	whatever	he	had	or	hadn’t	done,	it	didn’t	make	any	difference.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">people	of	Hurst	were	not	barbarians.	They	would	administer	what	medical	care</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	could	offer	and	make	the	wounded	comfortable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 tied	 to	 the	 bed	 seemed	 to	 perk	 up	 at	 the	 sight	 of	 Tommy	 and	 his charge.	 He	 tried	 to	 mouth	 something,	 but	 no	 words	 came	 out.	 Unnoticed,	 he extended	 a	 single	 finger	 towards	 the	 man	 with	 the	 bandaged	 head,	 his	 eyes flickering	 as	 his	 head	 slumped	 back	 against	 the	 pillow.	 Tommy	 lowered	 the wounded	 man	 back	 onto	 an	 empty	 bed,	 unlacing	 his	 boots.	 The	 man’s	 pupils were	dilated,	his	vision	cloudy.	He	was	struggling	to	maintain	focus	as	Tommy</p>
<p class="calibre1">moved	a	finger	back	and	forth	in	front	of	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	 your	 name?”	 he	 asked	 softly.	 There	 was	 no	 response,	 so	 he	 tried</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p234"></a>again.	“Can	you	tell	me	your	name?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 blinked	 back	 at	 Tommy	 and	 whispered,	 “Damian.	 My	 name’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">Damian	 King.”	 His	 voice	 sounded	 familiar	 to	 Riley.	 Clipped,	 northern,	 hard	 to place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	did	you	get	here?”	Tommy	continued,	suddenly	intrigued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 another	 pause	 as	 the	 wounded	 man	 tried	 to	 make	 sense	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">question.	“I’m	not	sure.	I	don’t	remember.	Where	am	I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 at	 Hurst	 Castle,”	 said	 Tommy.	 “Liz	 says	 you’ll	 be	 fine,	 but	 you’ve had	a	nasty	blow	to	the	head.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	spotted	Nathan	doing	what	he	did	best,	bustling	around,	making	lists	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">names	 and	 their	 symptoms.	 There	 were	 some	 casualties	 with	 more	 serious</p>
<p class="calibre1">injuries,	 gunshot	 wounds	 and	 the	 like,	 who	 would	 need	 urgent	 treatment.	 They didn’t	 hold	 too	 much	 hope	 for	 a	 couple	 of	 them.	 Zed	 spotted	 the	 man	 Tommy had	supported	through	and	did	a	double	take. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	noticed	his	puzzled	look,	following	his	stare	towards	the	man	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bandaged	head.	There	was	a	flicker	of	intelligence	in	his	eyes,	something	Riley</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	know	him?”	asked	Riley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	you?	This	is	the	piece	of	work	who	executed	Bob	and	tortured	Will	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	hospital.	What’s	he	doing	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 joking?	 This	 scumbag,”	 said	 Scottie,	 all	 traces	 of	 empathy	 towards the	wounded	man	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	more	she	looked,	the	more	Riley	thought	she	knew	the	man.	How	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">everyone	have	been	so	slow	on	the	uptake?	Of	course,	they	had	likely	never	seen</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 face	 in	 daylight,	 only	 glimpses	 in	 torchlight	 and	 shadows.	 It	 seemed implausible,	but	impossible	to	deny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	would	they	leave	their	leader	behind?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.	Perhaps	they	thought	he	was	dead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	want	us	to	do	with	him,”	asked	Scottie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	deal	with	him	later,”	spat	Nathan,	gritting	his	teeth.	“Take	him	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dungeon.	Jack	will	decide	when	he’s	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Tommy	and	Scottie	led	the	prisoner	from	the	room,	Will	appeared	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">doorway,	blocking	their	path.	He	grabbed	the	wounded	man	by	the	scruff	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">neck	and	lifted	him	off	his	feet,	smashing	him	back	against	the	wall.	“I	told	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">we’d	meet	again.	I’m	going	to	enjoy	wiping	that	grin	off	your	face,”	spat	Will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Damian	King’s	face	was	a	picture	of	puzzlement.	Unfazed	by	Will’s	anger,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">stared	back	with	cold	lifeless	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nathan	prised	the	two	men	apart,	inserting	himself	between	them.	“Back	off, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will.	Look	at	his	eyes,	he’s	all	messed	up,	he	doesn’t	even	know	where	he	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p235"></a>“Well	 he’s	 going	 to	 wish	 he	 never	 came	 here,”	 snarled	 Will,	 incredulous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	two	of	us	have	unfinished	business.”	Will	grabbed	the	prisoner	by	the	hair</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	hauled	him	in	close.	He	hawked	up	some	saliva	and	spat	in	his	face,	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">dumping	him	back	down	on	the	ground.	“I’m	going	to	make	you	regret	what	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">did	 to	 me.	 What	 you	 did	 to	 all	 of	 us.”	 He	 slapped	 King	 across	 the	 cheek	 and watched	as	Tommy	frogmarched	the	prisoner	away	to	the	dungeon. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p236"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Fifty-five</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 <i class="calibre4">USS	Chester</i>	passed	the	Needles	rocks	and	iconic	red	and	white	lighthouse on	 its	 northerly	 tip.	 Staying	 within	 the	 main	 shipping	 channel,	 the	 warship towered	 over	 the	 castle	 at	 Hurst	 and	 the	 corresponding	 fortifications	 on	 the island	 side,	 Fort	 Albert	 and	 Fort	 Victoria.	 The	  <i class="calibre4">Chester’s</i>	 progress	 slowed momentarily	as	she	entered	the	tidal	race	flowing	westwards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 the	 bridge,	 Lieutenant	 Peterson	 had	 ordered	 the	 crew	 to	 battle	 stations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	watched	enthralled	as	the	deck-mounted	heavy	machine	guns	swung	around</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 trained	 their	 sights	 on	 the	 battlements	 of	 Hurst.	 Spotters	 on	 the	 ship’s superstructure	 scanned	 the	 shoreline	 on	 both	 sides	 with	 high-powered</p>
<p class="calibre1">binoculars,	 in	 constant	 communication	 with	 sniper	 teams	 posted	 on	 the	 upper decks.	 They	 were	 still	 trying	 to	 establish	 contact	 with	 the	 Royal	 Navy	 at Portsmouth,	 getting	 no	 response.	 The	 radio	 operator	 couldn’t	 explain	 why	 they weren’t	answering.	The	panel	of	lights	and	screens	in	his	communication	centre</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	all	green.	Weather	conditions	were	moderate.	They	should	have	easily	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	range.	Peterson	requested	one	last	system	check. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sergeant	 Jones’s	 team	 had	 reported	 in	 a	 few	 minutes	 earlier.	 They	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">managed	 to	 commandeer	 a	 vehicle	 to	 inspect	 the	 missile	 crater	 and	 tangled wreckage	within	the	blast	area.	Briggs	was	not	one	of	the	five	bodies	they	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">recovered,	 nor	 for	 that	 matter	 was	 Terra.	 They	 said	 the	 Humvee	 was	 barely recognisable,	upside	down	on	its	roof.	They	had	videoed	everything,	collecting</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	physical	evidence	they	could	before	heading	back	to	Osborne	to	meet	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Seahawk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	waited	on	deck	as	the	crew	lowered	one	of	the	 <i class="calibre4">Chester</i>’s	fast	R.I.Bs	to speed	them	back	to	Hurst.	As	soon	as	they	were	through	the	tidal	race	and	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">calmer	 waters,	 they	 were	 ready	 to	 launch.	 Sam	 was	 watching	 a	 crewmember</p>
<p class="calibre1">prep	the	machine	gun	mounted	at	the	front	of	the	R.I.B,	loading	ammunition	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">checking	 the	 firing	 mechanism.	 Tommy	 would	 be	 so	 jealous.	 Sam	 said	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t	 wait	 to	 tell	 everyone	 about	 the	 ship	 and	 the	 ride	 in	 a	 helicopter.	 Two crewmembers	 helped	 Jack	 over	 to	 sit	 on	 a	 large	 grey	 container	 loaded	 with medical	equipment.	He	was	unable	to	stand	for	long,	but	had	insisted	on	coming</p>
<p class="calibre1">ashore	to	inspect	the	damage	to	the	castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 the	 bags	 and	 boxes	 were	 safely	 stowed	 and	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 team</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p237"></a>assembled,	 the	 command	 was	 given	 and	 a	 hydraulic	 winch	 whirred	 into	 life.	 It slowly	lowered	the	R.I.B	and	its	crew	until	it	splashed	down	in	the	ship’s	wash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 pilot	 started	 the	 outboard	 engines	 and	 steered	 away	 from	 the	 destroyer’s towering	 hull	 towards	 Keyhaven	 estuary	 and	 the	 sheltered	 dock	 behind	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">castle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	 after	 a	 lifetime	 at	 sea,	 Jack	 still	 found	 it	 exhilarating	 being	 in	 a	 high-speed	 launch.	 After	 the	 ocean-going	  <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>,	 the	 R.I.B	 felt	 like	 a	 seagull, skimming	 the	 surface,	 barely	 feeling	 each	 wave	 as	 they	 sped	 towards	 their destination.	 They	 passed	 the	 end	 of	 the	 Hurst	 battery,	 its	 familiar	 dark	 grey rectangles	 where	 heavy	 artillery	 would	 have	 faced	 the	 Needles	 channel,	 the white	lighthouse	and	outbuildings	that	Jack	called	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stretching	ahead	of	them	were	the	narrow-gauge	railway	tracks	that	led	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">castle	gate	from	the	original	docks	where	munitions	and	stores	would	have	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">unloaded.	Jack	noticed	his	Land	Rover	with	its	doors	still	wide	open,	as	if	it	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	abandoned.	Rounding	the	eastern	tip	of	the	spit,	they	headed	into	the	small</p>
<p class="calibre1">dock,	avoiding	a	half-submerged	yacht.	Only	its	mast	and	foredeck	were	visible</p>
<p class="calibre1">above	the	surface	at	high	tide,	seawater	swilled	over	its	guardrail,	tangled	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">seaweed	and	grey	foam.	A	large	gull	hopped	across	the	rail	as	they	approached, </p>
<p class="calibre1">before	 rising	 gracefully	 on	 the	 breeze,	 gliding	 a	 few	 metres	 away	 on	 to	 the crosstrees	of	another	yacht,	nodding	at	anchor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 could	 see	 Tommy	 racing	 down	 to	 meet	 them	 at	 the	 dock.	 The	 gunner</p>
<p class="calibre1">swung	his	bow-mounted	weapon	round	to	bear	on	Tommy’s	chest.	Jack	tapped</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 man	 on	 the	 shoulder	 and	 explained	 that	 he	 was	 friendly,	 much	 to	 Tommy’s relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 soon	 as	 the	 R.I.B.	 nudged	 against	 the	 pontoon,	 the	 four	 marines	 jumped ashore	and	fanned	out	left	and	right,	scanning	for	targets.	Sam	seemed	relieved</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	see	his	old	friend	Tommy	again,	punching	his	shoulder	as	they	fell	into	step, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sharing	a	smile	and	a	joke,	no	doubt	eager	to	swap	stories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	interrupted	their	excitement,	impatient	for	every	detail,	anxious	to	hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">news	about	any	casualties.	When	Tommy	mentioned	that	they	had	captured	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	 who	 led	 the	 attack,	 Jack	 straightened	 up,	 setting	 aside	 his	 pain	 and discomfort,	 emboldened	 by	 this	 unexpected	 consolation.	 He	 rolled	 the	 name</p>
<p class="calibre1">Damian	King	around	his	mouth,	as	if	trying	it	for	size,	searching	his	memory	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	 mention	 of	 the	 man.	 He	 was	 certain	 he	 wasn’t	 local.	 And	 yet,	 he	 was intrigued	 by	 the	 revelation	 that	 Will	 seemed	 to	 know	 the	 man	 from	 before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where	could	he	have	met	him? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back	 within	 the	 protected	 confines	 of	 the	 austere	 stone	 of	 the	 Tudor	 castle, Jack	seemed	to	relax	a	little,	his	painkillers	kicking	in.	Arm	in	sling,	he	stopped to	shake	hands	with	several	on	their	route.	They	descended	the	steep	stairs	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p238"></a>led	to	the	cellar.	It	was	damp	and	musty	down	here.	The	whole	place	still	reeked of	smoke,	with	noticeable	fire	damage	and	scoring	in	several	places	along	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">route.	 In	 the	 very	 corner	 of	 the	 main	 block,	 in	 the	 bowels	 of	 the	 castle,	 they arrived	 at	 a	 small	 dry	 storeroom	 where	 they	 would	 have	 kept	 munitions	 and explosives	in	centuries	past.	In	the	half-light	thrown	from	the	flame	of	a	lantern</p>
<p class="calibre1">hanging	 on	 a	 hook	 by	 the	 door,	 the	 guard	 leaning	 against	 the	 wall	 looked exhausted,	 waiting	 to	 be	 relieved.	 He	 roused	 himself	 as	 they	 approached,	 a flicker	 of	 recognition	 as	 he	 noticed	 Jack.	 They	 waited	 for	 the	 youth	 to	 retrieve the	key	from	a	pocket	of	his	green	Parka	coat.	The	heavy	oak	door	swung	open</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 reveal	 total	 darkness	 within,	 a	 small	 rectangle	 of	 light	 from	 the	 doorway	 at their	feet.	Nathan	powered	up	a	small	penlight	and	they	stepped	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 not	 immediately	 obvious	 that	 there	 was	 anything	 or	 anyone	 in	 the shadows	until	the	torch	beam	located	the	soles	of	a	pair	of	boots.	A	recumbent</p>
<p class="calibre1">figure	 with	 a	 bandaged	 head	 was	 slumped	 against	 the	 brick	 wall,	 shielding	 his eyes	from	the	light.	The	room	was	inhospitable,	to	say	the	least.	It	was	freezing</p>
<p class="calibre1">cold	so	close	to	the	waterline.	A	silver	rivulet	of	seawater	ran	past	the	prisoner’s boot	 towards	 a	 drain	 in	 the	 floor.	 Cobwebs	 hung	 from	 the	 low	 ceiling	 and	 oak beams	that	forced	the	standing	men	to	bend	double	as	they	advanced	further	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 cramped	 confines	 of	 the	 cell.	 Mould	 had	 found	 a	 home	 in	 every	 brick	 and every	stone	here.	Jack	could	taste	it	on	every	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	few	seconds,	they	all	stood	in	silence	as	the	others	shuffled	in	behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 guard	 handed	 them	 a	 hurricane	 lantern	 to	 throw	 some	 more	 light	 on	 the pitiful	conditions	of	the	prisoner’s	captivity.	The	room	stank	of	sweat	and	urine</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 the	 blue	 plastic	 bucket	 in	 the	 corner.	 The	 latch	 clicked	 shut	 behind	 them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 captive	 assiduously	 studied	 each	 of	 them,	 taking	 in	 every	 detail,	 his	 arms folded,	staring	back	with	no	shortage	of	contempt.	At	least	he	appeared	to	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">recovered	his	wits	since	his	capture. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
Nearly	an	hour	later,	the	three	men	shuffled	out,	shoulders	slumped,	their	body<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">language	dejected.	The	youth	relocked	the	door	and	resumed	his	lethargy	outside</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	cell.	Jack	and	Nathan	walked	a	discrete	distance	away	from	both	the	cell	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 guard	 before	 discussing	 what	 they	 had	 learned.	 Jack	 felt	 exhausted	 as	 if being	 in	 the	 same	 room,	 in	 the	 presence	 of	 this	 man,	 this	 monster,	 had	 drained him	of	every	ounce	of	energy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	we	know	he’s	not	lying?	He	could	have	invented	this	whole	story,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">suggested	Nathan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 I’d	 say	 he’s	 telling	 the	 truth	 all	 right.”	 Jack	 nodded.	 “The	 question	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p239"></a>why	he’s	telling	us	in	the	first	place?”	he	added,	stroking	his	chin	with	his	free hand.	“Zed	and	Riley	saw	at	first	hand	that	they	were	experimenting	on	people</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	 at	 the	 hospital.	 It	 stands	 to	 reason	 that	 a	 small	 percentage	 of	 the	 population would	have	natural	 immunity	to	the	 virus.	Who	knows,	 perhaps	with	sufficient</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	and	resources,	they	could	find	a	way	to	enhance	those	natural	defences	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">even	inoculate	against	the	virus.	Maybe	Adele	 <i class="calibre4">is</i>	one	of	those	lucky	few,	but	why would	he	tell	us	that?	What	could	he	hope	to	gain	by	telling	us	the	truth?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	shook	his	head,	frustrated	by	Jack’s	response.	“You	don’t	know	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	we	know	him.	You	weren’t	here.	Didn’t	you	hear	what	he	did?”	He	leaned</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward,	imploring	Jack	to	listen.	“He	deserves	to	die	for	what	he	did	here.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">executed	our	people.	Innocent,	unarmed	men	and	women.	He	ordered	his	thugs</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 shoot	 them	 in	 cold	 blood.	 Don’t	 be	 taken	 in	 by	 his	 lies.	 He’d	 say	 and	 do anything	 to	 get	 himself	 out	 of	 here	 and	 that’s	 why	 we	 can’t	 trust	 him.	 He’s telling	us	what	we	want	to	hear.	Don’t	you	see	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	stroked	his	wiry	beard,	flecked	with	grey	hairs	that	caught	the	light.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">closed	 his	 eyes,	 collecting	 his	 thoughts.	 Was	 he	 being	 naive	 in	 taking	 the prisoner’s	words	at	face	value?	He	thought	he	detected	conflict,	almost	as	if	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	wanted	them	to	know	the	truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen,”	 added	 Tommy.	 “Let’s	 agree	 that	 he’s	 trying	 to	 manipulate	 us.	 To what	end,	we	don’t	yet	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	patted	Tommy	on	the	back	to	reassure	him.	“Don’t	worry,	the	truth	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">reveal	itself	in	the	fullness	of	time.	It	always	does.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 and	 Scottie	 nodded	 silently,	 still	 puzzling	 over	 their	 earlier</p>
<p class="calibre1">interrogation	 of	 the	 prisoner.	 Jack	 was	 replaying	 the	 conversation	 in	 his	 head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	 didn’t	 stack	 up,	 but	 he	 couldn’t	 put	 his	 finger	 on	 it.	 Somewhere within	that	stream	of	disinformation	were	hidden	truths,	he	was	sure	of	it.	King</p>
<p class="calibre1">must	 have	 known	 they	 would	 share	 what	 they	 learned	 with	 the	 Americans.	 He would	figure	it	out	in	the	end.	He	normally	did.	Tommy	was	a	hot	head,	but	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	learn.	Patience,	it	had	to	be	said,	was	not	one	of	Tommy’s	strong	points. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nathan,	 you	 go	 talk	 to	 the	 girl	 and	 see	 what	 you	 can	 find	 out	 about	 these tests	 they	 were	 running.	 Ask	 her	 about	 this	 other	 girl	 he	 talked	 about,	 Stella. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	if	there’s	a	chance	they	have	immunity,	we	need	to	get	the	girls	to	a	secure</p>
<p class="calibre1">location.	This	could	accelerate	the	search	for	a	cure.	The	allies	are	setting	up	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">centre	 for	 research	 on	 the	 island,	 near	 Newport,	 led	 by	 Professor	 Nichols.	 This could	be	a	breakthrough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	need	to	tell	me	more	about	the	Americans	and	their	plans.	Right	now,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	fragments	only.	I	need	to	know	the	full	picture,”	implored	Nathan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“First,	I	want	a	one-on-one	chat	with	this	Damian	King.	If	it’s	just	the	two	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">us	he	might	let	his	guard	down,	open	up	a	bit	more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p240"></a>“Be	 careful,	 Jack.	 Don’t	 underestimate	 him.	 He’ll	 be	 plying	 you	 for information,	just	as	much	as	you	he,	trying	to	influence	you,”	warned	Scottie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’ll	 find	 I’m	 more	 than	 a	 match	 for	 him,”	 laughed	 Jack.	 “Although,	 why doesn’t	Tommy	wait	outside,	just	in	case,”	he	conceded. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p241"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Fifty-six</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	retraced	his	steps	to	the	improvised	cell,	waiting	for	the	guard	to	unlock	the door.	Once	inside,	he	crouched	down	on	his	knees	opposite	the	prisoner,	setting</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 lantern	 between	 them	 on	 the	 floor.	 The	 prisoner	 seemed	 to	 ignore	 him, staring	 up	 into	 the	 darkness,	 his	 eyes	 locked	 on	 a	 spider	 in	 the	 corner,	 quietly spinning	a	silvery	web	that	glistened	in	the	half-light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 a	 prolonged	 silence,	 King	 finally	 turned	 his	 head	 towards	 Jack	 as	 if noticing	him	for	the	first	time.	His	eyes	were	devoid	of	life,	like	dead	pools.	His face	 was	 expressionless,	 an	 impenetrable	 mask.	 Jack’s	 eyes	 narrowed,	 steeling himself	 to	 the	 task	 at	 hand,	 trying	 hard	 to	 maintain	 a	 calm	 exterior	 and	 air	 of authority,	as	he	pondered	his	next	move.	He	imagined	himself	as	a	chess-master</p>
<p class="calibre1">facing	 his	 greatest	 adversary,	 exploring	 cause	 and	 effect,	 waiting	 for	 his opponent	to	make	a	mistake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something	you	forgot	to	ask,	Jack?	I	think	I’ve	told	you	everything	I	want	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell	you,	for	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	we	cut	the	crap	and	start	again,	leader	to	leader,	so	to	speak?	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	warn	you,	no	more	games.	Until	you	start	telling	us	what	we	want	to	hear,	well, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 far	 as	 I’m	 concerned,	 we	 can	 leave	 you	 in	 here	 until	 you’re	 ready	 to	 talk, however	long	that	takes.	No	one’s	going	to	come	and	bust	you	out.”	Jack	paused, </p>
<p class="calibre1">waiting	 for	 his	 adversary	 to	 take	 stock	 and	 reflect	 on	 who	 held	 the	 balance	 of power.	 “Why	 don’t	 you	 start	 by	 telling	 me	 why	 you	 really	 attacked	 the	 castle? </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	why	your	men	saw	fit	to	leave	you	behind?	Everyone	seem	to	think	you’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 kind	 of	 Trojan	 horse,	 but	 it	 sounds	 more	 like	 you	 got	 careless.	 You’d served	your	purpose	and	they	discarded	you	like	a	broken	pencil.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 in	 black	 smiled,	 shifting	 his	 body	 weight	 and	 adopting	 the	 same kneeling	 position	 as	 Jack,	 mirroring	 his	 body	 language.	 Leaning	 forward,	 the lantern	 lit	 his	 face	 from	 below.	 His	 features	 seemed	 suddenly	 contorted	 in	 the pale	light,	his	eye	sockets	empty,	almost	ghoulish,	his	smile	demonic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 I	 don’t	 know,”	 he	 opened	 brightly.	 “I	 always	 saw	 myself	 living	 in	 a castle	one	day.	An	Englishman’s	home	is	his	castle,	isn’t	that	what	people	used</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 say?	 But	 after	 seeing	 this	 old	 dump,	 I’ve	 changed	 my	 mind.”	 He	 paused, staring	unblinking	at	Jack.	“If	you	really	need	me	to	spell	it	out.	There’s	no	big</p>
<p class="calibre1">secret.	That	Bok	of	yours,	Will,	told	me	all	about	this	place	and	I	figured,	why</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p242"></a>not?	Eliminate	a	rival	on	our	doorstep,	claim	the	castle	for	myself,	live	happily ever	after.	Perhaps	you	haven’t	noticed,	Jack,	but	it’s	dog-eat-dog	out	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whatever	goes	on	out	there	is	none	of	our	business.	We’re	peace-loving	folk</p>
<p class="calibre1">here;	we’re	not	looking	for	a	fight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nevertheless,	 sooner	 or	 later	 someone	 was	 going	 to	 come	 along	 and	 take</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	place	away	from	you.	It	was	just	a	matter	of	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	hardly	defenceless,	as	I	think	you	found	out	for	yourself	last	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can’t	live	in	your	little	bubble	forever.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bubble?	 Live	 and	 let	 live,	 I	 say.	 We’re	 doing	 what	 we	 can	 to	 get	 by. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Providing	we	catch	enough	fish	and	grow	enough	vegetables	to	feed	the	hungry, </p>
<p class="calibre1">then	we’re	happy	to	stay	clear	of	the	madness.	It	may	not	seem	like	much	to	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">power-hungry	 megalomaniac	 like	 yourself,	 but	 to	 us	 this	 is	 home.	 The	 life	 and security	people	craved.	This	is	survival.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	all	a	bit	‘Kum-ba-yah’,	isn’t	it,	Jack?	Sitting	round	a	campfire,	singing</p>
<p class="calibre1">songs,	saying	prayers,	slowly	dying	a	little	bit	every	day.	Then	what?	Out	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">people	 are	 doing	 more	 than	 just	 surviving.	 They’re	 getting	 organised, </p>
<p class="calibre1">reconnecting	with	other	groups,	rebuilding.	What	are	you	doing?	You	have	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">heads	 in	 the	 sand.	 Sooner	 or	 later	 you’re	 going	 to	 have	 to	 choose	 a	 side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alliances	 are	 forming	 and	 you	 can’t	 stay	 neutral	 forever.	 You’re	 not	 a	 colony; you’re	a	castle.	A	pile	of	bricks	and	stone,	nothing	more,”	goaded	the	prisoner, </p>
<p class="calibre1">trying	to	rile	Jack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	parried	with	a	dismissive	wave,	trying	his	best	to	remain	calm,	adopting</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	best	poker	face	but	marshalling	his	rising	sense	of	anger.	“What	makes	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">think	we	haven’t	chosen	sides	already?	You	think	we’re	isolated	and	alone	here? </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’re	 not.	 When	 you	 attack	 Hurst,	 you	 attack	 a	 whole	 network	 of	 Solent	 forts and	 small	 communities	 pulling	 together.	 We	 don’t	 stand	 alone,	 we’re	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">interconnected	alliance	growing	and	expanding.	Just	because	we’ve	chosen	a	life</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 neutrality	 and	 non-aggression	 doesn’t	 mean	 that	 we	 won’t	 stand	 up	 for	 our way	of	life	when	challenged.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	have	the	balls,”	he	snorted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wouldn’t	be	so	sure.	We’ll	hunt	down	the	men	who	did	this	like	the	vermin</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 are.	 Wherever	 they’re	 hiding,	 we’ll	 find	 them.	 We	 have	 powerful	 friends who	protect	us	and	watch	over	us.	There’s	a	new	order	coming	to	sweep	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">people	like	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I	know	all	about	the	Americans	and	Camp	Wight.	Don’t	tell	me	that’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	big	secret?	You	really	think	you	were	the	only	ones	invited	to	the	meeting</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	Osborne	House?	Some	of	us	chose	not	to	go.	Ever	considered	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	was	blinking	furiously,	trying	to	keep	his	emotions	under	control,	while</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 mind	 raced	 to	 play	 catch-up.	 He	 took	 a	 moment	 to	 compose	 himself, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p243"></a>genuinely	 lost	 for	 words.	 “Whatever	 you	 think	 you	 know,	 you	 only	 know	 the half	of	it.	Things	are	moving	quickly,”	he	said,	before	pausing	abruptly.	“Oh,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgive	 me,	 perhaps	 you	 don’t	 know,	 all	 cooped	 up	 in	 here,	 cut	 off	 from everything	that’s	happened	over	the	last	few	hours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Capturing	me	changes	nothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wouldn’t	be	so	sure.	You’d	do	well	to	realise	that	you	and	I	are	but	pawns</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	a	much	larger	game.	There’s	nothing	you	can	do	to	stop	our	plans.	The	wheels</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	 already	 in	 motion.	 Unless,	 that	 is,	 you	 have	 a	 whole	 army	 at	 your</p>
<p class="calibre1">command?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I	have	something	much	better	than	an	army,	or	a	navy	for	that	matter.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 a	 virus.	 A	 pandemic	 virus.	 Left	 unchecked,	 it’s	 capable	 of	 wiping	 out human	 life	 on	 this	 planet	 as	 we	 know	 it.	 Phase	 one	 of	 that	 process	 is	 already complete.	Whoever	controls	the	cure	pulls	the	strings,	holds	the	fate	of	all	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">who	remain	alive.	Just	think	of	the	power	bestowed	upon	whoever	can	be	first	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">manufacture	 and	 distribute	 a	 vaccine?	 Wealth	 and	 influence	 beyond	 anyone’s wildest	dreams.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 yet,	 despite	 all	 that	  <i class="calibre4">power</i>,	 you	 risked	 your	 own	 life	 to	 get	 the	 girls back.”	 Jack	 laughed	 scornfully.	 “You’re	 bluffing.	 Without	 the	 girls,	 you	 have nothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	prisoner	sneered	back	at	him,	mocking	Jack’s	attempts	to	provoke	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Losing	the	girls	was	an	inconvenience,	a	trifle,	nothing	more.	A	minor	setback</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 our	 plans.	 The	 girls	 are	 of	 little	 importance.	 And	 you	 should	 know	 that without	their	daily	injections,	they’ll	die	like	all	the	rest	and	then	you	will	have nothing.	 But	 I	 will	 still	 have	 months’	 worth	 of	 research.	 We	 already	 know	 so much	 about	 the	 virus.	 We	 have	 samples	 of	 their	 blood,	 more	 than	 enough	 to continue	 our	 experiments.	 The	 girls	 mean	 nothing	 now.	 You	 can	 have	 them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’re	yours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	was	beginning	to	panic.	He	was	running	out	of	moves.	He’d	played	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">cards,	and	found	his	adversary	always	seemed	to	hold	the	upper	hand,	or	at	least</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	better	at	bluffing	than	him.	He	was	taunting	Jack	that	he	knew	everything	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew	 and	 more,	 but	 how?	 He	 had	 to	 be	 in	 league	 with	 someone	 else	 who	 had been	at	the	Osborne	House	dinner.	In	his	mind,	he	replayed	the	mental	image	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	drone	footage,	of	Briggs	standing	next	to	Victor	from	the	 <i class="calibre4">Maersk	Charlotte</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	 idea	 began	 to	 form.	 A	 conspiracy.	 Was	 it	 possible	 they	 were	 all	 working together?	 A	 powerful	 alliance	 that	 would	 stop	 at	 nothing	 to	 see	 the	 plans	 for Camp	Wight	fail	and	chaos	continue	in	the	region.	But	why?	To	what	end? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Poor	 Jack,”	 King	 continued.	 “You	 really	 don’t	 understand,	 do	 you?	 You</p>
<p class="calibre1">really	think	that	the	Americans	can	just	waltz	in	here	and	everyone	will	roll	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 welcome	 them	 with	 open	 arms,	 share	 all	 our	 food	 and	 resources	 with	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p244"></a>foreign	power?	Don’t	be	so	naive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Au	 contraire,”	 gambled	 Jack.	 “You’re	 the	 one	 who’s	 being	 naive.	 Perhaps</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	haven’t	heard?	Oh,	how	silly	of	me,	I	forgot.	You’ve	been	stuck	in	here.	Out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	loop.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very	well,	Jack,”	he	said	with	a	sigh.	“What	have	I	not	heard?	Surprise	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Parkhurst	crew.	Dead.	Destroyed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">King	pursed	his	lips	and	grimaced:	“Parkhurst	Prison?	What	are	you	talking</p>
<p class="calibre1">about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	friend	Briggs	is	dead.	The	axis	of	evil	is	finished,	before	it	ever	had	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">chance	to	get	going.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">King	laughed	again,	throwing	his	hands	up	in	mock	despair	but	showing	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">flicker	 of	 recognition	 that	 he	 knew	 what	 Jack	 was	 talking	 about.	 Jack’s	 gambit had	 failed.	 His	 lie	 about	 Briggs	 fell	 on	 deaf	 ears	 and	 he	 did	 a	 poor	 job	 at concealing	his	frustration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Axis	of	evil?	If	that’s	what	you	really	think	then	you’re	even	more	deluded</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	I	thought.	Please	don’t	kid	yourself	that	the	world	is	somehow	a	safer	place</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	 you’ve	 captured	 one	 evil	 genius	 hell-bent	 on	 your	 destruction.	 The	 new world	 is	 full	 of	 people	 like	 me.	 I’m	 just	 like	 you,	 Jack.	 Fighting	 for	 what	 I believe	in,	looking	after	my	own.	Trying	to	make	a	better	life.	You	want	to	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 difference	 between	 us?	 You	 see	 the	 world	 through	 rose-tinted	 glasses.	 You think	 everyone	 is	 inherently	 good.	 I	 don’t.	 I’m	 a	 realist.	 Life	 is	 a	 game	 and people	are	merely	pieces	on	a	chessboard.	You	just	have	to	figure	out	how	to	use</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	 to	 win.”	 King	 shook	 his	 head	 with	 a	 pained	 expression,	 enjoying	 the moment.	“You	still	don’t	get	it,	do	you?	You	think	because	you	live	in	a	castle</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re	better	than	the	rest	of	us?	You’re	pathetic.	You	see	the	world	in	absolutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Good	versus	evil.	Life	is	never	that	black	and	white.	Don’t	judge	a	book	by	its</p>
<p class="calibre1">cover.	Next,	you’ll	be	telling	me	that	living	in	a	lighthouse	makes	you	a	shining</p>
<p class="calibre1">beacon	to	others,	you	self-righteous	arse.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	was	shaking	with	rage,	his	left	eye	flickering	involuntarily.	“No,	King, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re	wrong.	Our	actions	define	us	as	people.	Not	our	clothes,	or	what	we	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	see	the	world	in	shades	of	grey.	I	don’t.	I	draw	the	line	at	killing	innocent</p>
<p class="calibre1">people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Innocent?	Guilty?	The	search	for	a	cure	is	what	matters.	Our	very	survival</p>
<p class="calibre1">depends	 on	 it.	 The	 end	 justifies	 the	 means.	 If	 that	 means	 a	 few	 thousand	 extra people	 need	 to	 die	 while	 we	 test	 a	 vaccine,	 isn’t	 that	 a	 price	 worth	 paying? </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	progress,	no?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	talking	about	all	those	hundreds	of	people	you	killed	in	the	name	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">science.	I’m	talking	about	the	women	and	children	you	murdered	in	cold	blood, </p>
<p class="calibre1">right	here.	My	people.	They	were	unarmed.	They	didn’t	stand	a	chance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p245"></a>“You	 think	 the	 death	 of	 your	 people	 makes	 the	 slightest	 bit	 of	 difference? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don’t	be	so	sentimental.	Thousands	of	people	are	dying	every	day.”	He	clicked</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 fingers	 repeatedly	 to	 emphasise	 the	 point,	 then	 paused	 and	 smiled, </p>
<p class="calibre1">remembering	something.	“Curious	to	think	that	your	people	were	put	out	of	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">misery	by	former	policemen.	Interesting,	no?”	He	put	his	finger	to	his	lip,	tilting his	 head	 before	 continuing	 in	 a	 mocking	 voice	 laced	 with	 irony.	 “How	 quickly people	change.	It	didn’t	take	much	to	persuade	men	who	dedicated	their	lives	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">upholding	 the	 law	 that	 killing	 others	 is	 right	 and	 necessary.	 The	 rules	 of	 the game	have	changed.	Wake	up	and	smell	the	coffee,	Jack.	The	world	has	changed</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 it	 is	 you	 who	 haven’t	 kept	 up.	 You	 bury	 your	 heads	 in	 the	 sand	 here	 like ostriches.	 You’re	 no	 better	 than	 me	 or	 anyone	 else.	 You	 just	 think	 you	 are.	 If you’re	 not	 careful,	 you’re	 going	 to	 find	 yourselves	 isolated	 and	 alone	 here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps	 you’ve	 forgotten	 that	 Camp	 Wight	 will	 be	 on	 the	 wrong	 side	 of	 the Solent.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	fought	you	off	before.	We’ll	do	it	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?	How	can	a	bunch	of	fishermen	like	you	hope	to	protect	this	castle</p>
<p class="calibre1">against	a	whole	army	of	trained	paramilitaries?	My	men	won’t	give	up	until	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">place	 is	 razed	 to	 the	 ground.	 Next	 time,	 you	 won’t	 stand	 a	 chance,	 even	 with your	new	friends.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	really	think	they’ll	come	back	and	risk	their	lives	to	save	you?	They’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">leave	you	here	to	rot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	men	won’t	come	back	here	for	me.	So	long	as	they	have	breath	in	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">lungs	and	bullets	in	their	guns,	they’ll	keep	coming	until	your	pathetic	group	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">wiped	 out.	 It’s	 just	 what	 they	 do.	 Your	 people	 came	 to	 Hurst	 to	 die.	 They	 just don’t	know	it	yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	had	taken	all	he	could	take	for	one	day,	but	King	wasn’t	finished	yet.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	one	last	poisonous	thought	to	share. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	it	hasn’t	occurred	to	you	that	I	could	be	a	carrier,	slowly	spreading</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	virus.	Immune	myself,	but	infecting	you	and	your	people	even	now.	Bet	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t	 think	 of	 that.	 Careless,	 Jack,	 sitting	 so	 close,	 breathing	 the	 same	 air	 as me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Listening	to	the	man	in	black’s	hollow	laugh,	Jack	shuddered.	It	had	occurred</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 him	 that	 the	 girls	 may	 not	 be	 the	 only	 ones	 immune	 to	 the	 virus,	 but	 the chances	of	any	of	the	rest	of	the	hospital	group	being	immune	were	a	hundred-to-one.	He	shook	his	head,	refusing	to	rise	to	the	bait. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	better	things	to	do	than	listen	to	the	delusions	of	a	man	who’s	never</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	to	see	the	light	of	day	again.	I’ll	leave	you	to	your	twisted	thoughts.	We’ll talk	again	when	I’m	good	and	ready.	Enjoy	your	silence	and	solitude.	That’s	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’ll	get	from	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p246"></a>Jack	 had	 had	 enough	 of	 this	 goading.	 For	 the	 last	 few	 minutes,	 he’d	 been clenching	his	fists,	tighter	and	tighter.	He	could	feel	the	veins	on	the	side	of	his neck	 throbbing.	 He	 swore	 that	 if	 he	 spent	 one	 more	 minute	 with	 this	 man,	 this monster,	 he’d	 tear	 him	 limb	 from	 limb.	 He	 stood	 up	 too	 quickly,	 clumsily kicking	 over	 the	 lantern	 that	 stood	 between	 them.	 The	 glass	 smashed	 and	 the flame	 was	 extinguished	 in	 the	 dust	 on	 the	 ground,	 its	 wick	 and	 mounting tumbling	clear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 whole	 room	 was	 suddenly	 plunged	 into	 darkness.	 Jack	 scrambled</p>
<p class="calibre1">towards	 the	 doorway,	 feeling	 with	 his	 hands	 in	 front	 of	 him.	 He	 started hammering	 and	 shouting	 Tommy’s	 name,	 trying	 to	 keep	 a	 lid	 on	 his	 mounting fear.	 The	 man	 in	 black’s	 disembodied	 voice	 in	 the	 darkness	 seemed	 to	 come from	multiple	directions,	echoing	off	the	walls	of	the	dry	storage	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Poor	Jack,”	he	repeated,	followed	by	that	same	hollow	laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 banged	 louder	 before	 the	 key	 turned	 and	 Tommy’s	 friendly	 face</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared	in	the	doorway,	peering	in	to	see	what	was	happening.	Jack	wrenched</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	door	open	wider	and	barged	Tommy	out	of	the	way,	desperate	to	get	as	far</p>
<p class="calibre1">away	 from	 the	 prisoner	 as	 he	 could.	 Tommy	 stood	 for	 a	 second,	 staring	 after Jack	 as	 he	 hurried	 away.	 Behind	 him,	 Tommy	 looked	 back	 into	 the	 darkness, wondering	what	had	spooked	Jack,	searching	out	the	face	of	the	man	inside.	All</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	could	see	were	his	legs	and	the	smashed	lantern	on	the	ground.	He	stooped	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">pick	up	the	lamp	and	the	larger	shards	of	glass	and	slammed	the	door	shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 the	 stairs,	 he	 found	 Jack	 limping	 heavily,	 perspiration	 on	 his	 forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 supported	 him	 through	 the	 narrow	 doorway	 to	 the	 roof	 of	 the	 Gun</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tower.	Jack	fell	on	his	hands	and	knees	and	dry	retched,	breathing	hard.	When</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	had	recovered	his	wits,	he	hobbled	over	and	found	Nathan	looking	out	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 battlements,	 surveying	 the	  <i class="calibre4">USS	 Chester’s</i>	 progress	 east	 towards	 Cowes	 and Southampton	 Water.	 Jack	 snatched	 the	 walkie-talkie	 from	 Nathan’s	 belt	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">depressed	the	talk	button. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Peterson,	it’s	Jack	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	few	seconds	delay	before	a	voice	he	recognised	well	came	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">loud	and	clear.	“Go	ahead,	Jack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	got	a	major	problem.	I	don't	know	how,	but	they	know.	King	knows</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	about	Camp	Wight.”	There	was	no	response	from	Peterson	so	Jack	continued, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 stress	 obvious	 in	 his	 voice.	 “And	 it	 sounds	 like	 the	 story	 about	 the	 girls	 is bona	fide.	They	do	have	immunity	to	the	virus.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 a	 long	 silence,	 while	 Jack	 checked	 the	 volume	 on	 the	 radio	 to make	sure	it	was	still	transmitting	and	the	battery	hadn’t	failed,	before	he	heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 American’s	 response.	 “Copy	 that.	 Let’s	 continue	 this	 conversation	 face	 to face.	Be	careful	what	you	say,	Jack,	this	is	an	unsecure	line.	Let’s	get	those	girls</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p247"></a>to	a	safe	location.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	 one	 of	 them	 is	 safe.	 And	 we	 think	 we	 know	 where	 to	 find	 the	 other one.	We’re	going	to	need	some	transport	though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 another	 silence.	 “We’ve	 got	 our	 hands	 a	 little	 full	 right	 now,	 but we’ll	send	the	chopper	as	soon	as	it	can	be	spared.	Hang	in	there,	Jack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 signed	 off	 and	 looked	 back	 towards	 the	 island.	 Dark	 clouds	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">blowing	in	from	the	south-west.	He	could	see	light	rain	falling	underneath.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">dull	 ache	 in	 his	 shoulder	 intensified	 as	 the	 painkillers	 began	 to	 wear	 off.	 His heart	sank	and	his	eyes	closed	as	he	remembered	the	loss	of	Terra.	It	was	as	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’d	locked	that	memory	away	and	stumbled	across	it	again	unexpectedly.	Sam</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	right.	She	was	a	resourceful	woman.	She	would	do	whatever	it	took	to	stay</p>
<p class="calibre1">alive.	He	had	to	believe	that	and	trust	to	luck. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p248"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Fifty-seven</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	late	on	the	second	day	after	the	attack	on	Hurst	when	the	helicopter	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">released	 from	 its	 more	 pressing	 duties	 ferrying	 military	 personnel.	 Osborne House	 had	 been	 set	 up	 as	 a	 temporary	 command	 centre	 for	 the	 newly	 formed Camp	 Wight,	 under	 the	 protection	 of	 a	 detachment	 of	 US	 marines	 led	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sergeant	Jones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peterson	 had	 re-established	 communication	 with	 the	 Royal	 Navy	 and	 now</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	a	permanent	liaison	officer	based	in	Portsmouth	to	foster	improved	relations</p>
<p class="calibre1">between	the	two	allies.	As	a	gesture	towards	reciprocity,	Captain	Armstrong	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">installed	 one	 of	 his	 trusted	 deputies	 on	 board	 the	  <i class="calibre4">USS	 Chester</i>	 to	 act	 as	 local guide	and	pilot	to	orient	the	Americans	around	the	Solent	waters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peterson	and	the	helicopter	crew	collected	Riley	from	the	grassy	area	next	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 lighthouse,	 where	 she	 had	 been	 waiting	 for	 some	 time,	 scanning	 the	 skies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	she	was	safely	on	board	and	the	crewmen	had	helped	secure	the	straps	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	jump	seat	next	to	the	sliding	door,	they	took	off	towards	the	Chewton	Glen</p>
<p class="calibre1">hotel	in	search	of	Stella. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 helicopter	 flew	 low	 over	 the	 trees	 and	 houses	 of	 Milford,	 hugging	 the water’s	 edge	 towards	 Christchurch.	 Riley	 braced	 herself	 by	 the	 open	 door, thrilled	by	the	sensation	of	speed,	wind	blowing	in	her	hair,	straining	against	her seatbelt	 to	 see	 below	 the	 aircraft.	 Her	 long	 brown	 hair	 flicked	 in	 her	 eyes	 and face	 and	 she	 held	 back	 a	 handful	 of	 fringe	 with	 her	 free	 hand.	 With	 her	 other hand,	she	gripped	the	handle	nearest	her.	They	passed	over	a	golf	course,	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">grass	 grew	 long	 and	 verdant	 on	 deserted	 fairways	 and	 greens.	 Turning	 inland over	 Barton-on-sea,	 they	 traversed	 roads	 and	 roundabouts	 clogged	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">stationary	traffic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	gestured	to	Peterson	to	slow	down	and	the	nose	pitched	upwards	as	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">lost	speed,	coming	into	a	hover	above	the	main	road	and	front	gate	to	the	hotel</p>
<p class="calibre1">fifty	 metres	 below	 them.	 Riley	 leaned	 out	 as	 far	 as	 the	 seatbelt	 straps	 would allow.	The	truck	blocking	the	front	entrance	was	gone.	Something	was	wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 pointed	 towards	 the	 main	 block	 and	 cluster	 of	 buildings	 a	 few	 hundred metres	 away	 and	 Peterson	 relayed	 the	 message	 to	 the	 pilot.	 They	 continued onwards,	following	the	path	of	the	driveway	that	curved	left	and	then	right	past</p>
<p class="calibre1">trees	 and	 the	 first	 of	 several	 planted	 fields	 and	 vegetable	 patches.	 The	 fire</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p249"></a>damage	to	the	roof	of	the	hotel	was	worse	than	she	had	first	imagined.	It	seemed to	 extend	 along	 half	 the	 length	 of	 one	 of	 the	 buildings.	 They	 lost	 height	 and gently	 touched	 down	 on	 the	 side	 lawn.	 A	 swimming	 pool	 visible	 just	 beyond some	bushes	looked	like	it	had	been	drained	and	used	for	storage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 was	 fully	 expecting	 a	 crowd	 to	 rush	 out	 to	 welcome	 them,	 Stella	 and Sister	 Mel	 at	 its	 head,	 waving	 towards	 them.	 No	 one	 came.	 The	 place	 seemed deserted.	Where	was	everyone? </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 waited	 for	 the	 twin	 engines	 to	 power	 down.	 Two	 marines	 set	 up</p>
<p class="calibre1">defensive	positions	covering	the	front	and	rear	of	the	aircraft,	before	the	airmen</p>
<p class="calibre1">allowed	Riley	and	Peterson	to	climb	out	on	to	the	soft	grass.	The	first	marine	ran</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 corner	 of	 the	 building	 and	 took	 up	 a	 kneeling	 position,	 scanning	 to	 their right.	 Once	 he	 signalled	 all-clear,	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 group	 ran	 towards	 the	 main entrance,	staying	low. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	a	dozen	paces	from	the	entrance	when	Peterson	held	out	his	arm</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	block	Riley	from	going	any	further.	She	looked	up	at	him	puzzled,	following</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	line	of	his	outstretched	finger.	It	took	her	a	couple	of	seconds	to	see	what	he was	pointing	out.	Riley	clasped	her	hand	to	her	mouth	to	stop	herself	screaming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	 the	 right	 of	 the	 doorway,	 someone	 had	 spray-painted	 a	 large	 red	 skull	 and cross	bones,	warning	others	not	to	enter.	Riley	gripped	Peterson’s	arm,	trying	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">keep	a	lid	on	a	mounting	sense	of	panic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Peterson.	 It’s	 not	 possible.	 We	 were	 here	 not	 two	 days	 ago.	 There	 was	 no sickness.	There	must	be	some	mistake.	Everything	was	fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	 one	 goes	 inside	 without	 a	 biohazard	 suit,	 am	 I	 clear?	 Pavlowski,	 break out	the	suits	and	breathing	gear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 had	 never	 worn	 an	 airtight	 suit	 before.	 They	 were	 standard-issue	 in green	PVC	material	with	an	oversize	clear	Perspex	front	panel	that	restricted	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wearer’s	field	of	vision	to	the	sides.	The	suit	she	was	handed	was	several	sizes</p>
<p class="calibre1">too	big	for	her	and	went	over	all	of	her	clothes,	zipping	up	and	sealing	tight	from behind.	 The	 head	 section	 and	 breathing	 gear	 took	 a	 while	 to	 get	 used	 to.	 The suits	were	claustrophobic	and	she	found	the	Perspex	viewing	panel	had	a	minor</p>
<p class="calibre1">magnifying	 effect,	 like	 reading	 glasses,	 distorting	 the	 world	 outside.	 Corporal Pavlowski	helped	tape	her	sleeves	closed	and	turned	her	air	on	before	attending</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	his	own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	group	of	four	was	ready	and	had	checked	each	other’s	equipment</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 seals,	 Peterson	 split	 them	 into	 two-man	 teams	 and	 they	 proceeded	 inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 could	 hear	 her	 own	 breathing	 as	 she	 moved	 and	 stayed	 tight	 behind Pavlowski.	In	his	gloved	right	hand	he	carried	a	pistol	just	in	case	they	met	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">resistance.	 She	 tapped	 him	 on	 the	 shoulder	 and	 pointed	 down	 the	 corridor towards	the	main	living	area.	In	the	lobby	there	were	suitcases,	plastic	sacks	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p250"></a>equipment	 stacked	 near	 the	 door,	 rubbish	 strewn	 across	 the	 carpet	 as	 if	 people had	left	in	a	hurry.	There	was	no	sign	of	Stella,	or	anyone	else	for	that	matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peterson	took	his	team	up	the	main	stairs	as	Riley	searched	the	ground	floor</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 building.	 Riley	 knew	 the	 layout	 of	 the	 hotel	 directing	 Pavlowski	 as	 they went	 from	 room	 to	 room,	 through	 the	 kitchen,	 canteen	 and	 living	 room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everywhere	 they	 went	 told	 the	 same	 story.	 The	 place	 looked	 like	 it	 had	 been ransacked;	contents	of	desks	rifled	and	drawers	left	hanging,	books	missing	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">shelves,	papers	strewn	across	surfaces.	Had	they	been	attacked,	she	wondered? </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	no	obvious	signs	of	a	fire	fight,	no	bullet	holes,	no	bodies.	What	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened	here? </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	heard	a	loud	banging	on	the	ceiling	from	the	floor	above	and	Pavlowski</p>
<p class="calibre1">grabbed	 Riley	 and	 gestured	 for	 her	 to	 follow.	 The	 suits	 were	 bulky	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">cumbersome.	She	found	it	difficult	to	run	any	faster	than	a	slow	shuffle	without</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	head	section	bouncing	awkwardly	and	the	seams	securing	them	to	the	main</p>
<p class="calibre1">body	threatening	to	tear	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 they	 reached	 the	 top	 of	 the	 stairs	 they	 found	 Peterson	 and	 the	 other crewman.	His	body	was	braced	against	the	closed	fire	door,	as	if	something	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying	 to	 break	 out	 from	 the	 inside.	 The	 suit	 muffled	 Peterson’s	 voice.	 “We’ve found	something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley’s	 eyes	 darted	 left	 and	 right,	 waiting	 impatiently	 for	 him	 to	 continue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	it?	What	did	you	find?”	she	implored. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	going	to	need	to	limit	our	time	inside.	I’m	sorry	but	there	are	many</p>
<p class="calibre1">casualties.	Find	out	what	you	can,	but	don’t	hang	around.	The	suits	are	airtight, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	we’re	not	taking	any	chances.	We’re	looking	for	the	girl.	We’re	not	here	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">help	the	injured.	Are	we	clear?”	The	three	others	nodded	and	Peterson	released</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	fire	door,	and	the	two	groups	stepped	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 corridor	 stretched	 ahead	 of	 them	 with	 doors	 either	 side.	 Riley	 was	 not familiar	with	this	part	of	the	hotel	but	recognised	the	style	and	layout	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rooms	she	had	already	seen.	She	stood	outside,	waiting	for	Pavlowski	to	give	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	nod	that	he	was	ready,	gun	poised	in	case	someone	tried	to	rush	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside	 the	 first	 room,	 there	 were	 a	 total	 of	 seven	 bodies.	 The	 two	 shapes	 in the	bed	were	already	dead,	or	as	good	as,	non-responsive	and	barely	breathing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	more	were	in	armchairs	positioned	to	look	out	of	the	large	sash	window	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 garden	 and	 flowerbeds	 beyond.	 It	 was	 as	 if	 someone	 had	 wanted	 their	 last conscious	moments	to	be	contented	ones,	contemplating	the	beauty	of	the	trees</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	lines	of	carrots	and	potatoes	growing	in	turned	earth	nearby.	The	heads</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 two	 figures	 in	 the	 armchairs	 rotated	 towards	 the	 strange	 pair	 standing	 in the	 middle	 of	 the	 room.	 One	 of	 the	 women	 weakly	 held	 out	 a	 hand	 towards Riley,	 her	 hair	 matted	 with	 dried	 perspiration,	 greasy	 and	 lank.	 She	 recognised</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p251"></a>the	woman’s	face	from	the	canteen,	one	of	the	kitchen	staff.	Riley	inclined	her head	sympathetically	as	tears	started	to	stream	down	her	face.	She	couldn’t	wipe</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pavlowski	heard	her	sob	and	was	behind	her	in	an	instant.	“You	okay,	Riley? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keep	 it	 together,	 yeah?	 If	 our	 girl	 ain’t	 here,	 we	 keep	 moving.	 We	 finish	 our sweep	and	get	out	of	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	nodded	and	reluctantly	moved	to	the	next	room.	Room	number	twenty-</p>
<p class="calibre1">eight.	They	tried	the	handle	and	found	it	was	locked	so	proceeded	on	to	the	next. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside	room	thirty,	they	found	the	nurse	all	alone,	keeping	a	silent	vigil	over	the sick.	 She	 seemed	 to	 be	 sleeping	 and	 did	 not	 respond	 to	 their	 voices	 or	 touch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pavlowski	shook	her	hard	and	lightly	slapped	her	face.	She	jolted	upright	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">chair	 as	 if	 an	 electric	 shock	 had	 been	 passed	 through	 her.	 Her	 eyes	 were	 wild, frightened	 by	 the	 two	 figures	 standing	 in	 front	 of	 her	 like	 astronauts	 from another	planet.	Riley	spoke	to	her,	but	she	didn’t	seem	to	recognise	her	at	first	or understand	what	she	was	saying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nurse,	it’s	Riley.	You	looked	after	my	friend	Zed.	Do	you	remember	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	leaned	in	close,	slowing	her	words,	annunciating	clearly.	“The	man	who	hurt</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	arm.	We	were	here	a	couple	of	days	ago.”	Riley	grabbed	her	shoulders	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">shook	her	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	nurse	shook	her	head,	looking	through	her,	clasping	her	hands	together	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 lap,	 stroking	 a	 rough	 patch	 of	 skin	 on	 the	 back	 of	 her	 wrist	 where	 she	 had rubbed	it	raw	with	worry.	She	was	rocking	backwards	and	forwards,	terrified	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">confused.	Riley	tried	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	happened	here?	Where	is	everyone?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	nurse	seemed	to	come	to	her	senses	momentarily.	“It’s	just	us	now.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1">left	me	all	alone	with	the	sick.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gone	where?”	Riley	shook	her	again	by	the	shoulders	but	the	nurse	grabbed</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 wrist	 to	 make	 her	 stop,	 staring	 angrily	 into	 her	 eyes	 through	 the	 plastic, resenting	this	intrusion	into	her	private	despair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 sisters	 took	 the	 rest	 of	 them	 to	 a	 safe	 place.	 They	 left	 me	 in	 charge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	nothing	I	can	do,	except	make	them	comfortable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	understand.	There	was	no	sickness	here	when	I	left.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mother	 Superior	 said	 the	 men	 brought	 the	 sickness.	 She	 blamed	 your</p>
<p class="calibre1">friend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 that’s	 impossible.	 None	 of	 our	 group	 are	 sick,”	 replied	 Riley</p>
<p class="calibre1">incredulously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	 now.	 They	 may	 not	 know	 they	 are	 sick.	 Carriers,	 unaware	 that	 their every	 breath	 is	 deadly	 to	 others.	 This	 is	 how	 the	 virus	 spreads	 so	 fast.	 People carry	on	until	they	have	infected	everyone	around	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p252"></a>Riley	was	unconvinced.	She	knew	the	virus	well	through	observing	the	new arrivals	at	Hurst	and	their	forty-eight	hours	of	quarantine.	Symptoms	presented</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves	quickly,	coughing,	sneezing,	fever.	It	simply	wasn’t	possible	that	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">members	 of	 the	 Hurst	 team	 could	 have	 spread	 the	 virus,	 unless	 they	 were immune	themselves.	None	of	that	seemed	to	make	any	sense.	She	addressed	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">nurse	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	fell	ill	first?	That	might	give	us	a	clue.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	me	think.	It	all	happened	so	fast.	I	think	it	was	the	two	girls.	They	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought	 to	 see	 me	 first,	 complaining	 of	 feeling	 run-down	 and	 feverish.	 Of course,	I	knew	right	away	what	it	was,	or	what	I	feared	it	might	be.	But	by	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	was	already	too	late.	They	had	been	in	contact	with	half	a	dozen	others,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	in	turn	had	been	in	contact	with	half	a	dozen	more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 were	 their	 names?”	 asked	 Riley	 urgently,	 grabbing	 her	 shoulders</p>
<p class="calibre1">forcefully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	Lexie	and	her	friend	Gina.	They	were	the	first,	I’m	sure	of	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	remembered	them	well.	They	had	been	the	two	teenagers	who	told	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	the	boys	they	used	to	meet	from	outside	the	hotel	grounds,	drinking	cider</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	smoking	together	behind	the	shed.	The	snatched	kiss.	Riley	was	convinced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 all	 probability,	 the	 girls	 were	 the	 most	 likely	 source	 of	 the	 outbreak.	 She didn’t	for	a	moment	believe	that	the	team	from	Hurst	had	brought	the	virus	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">them.	 There	 had	 been	 no	 other	 reported	 cases	 at	 Hurst	 for	 months.	 They	 were clean,	 but	 it	 was	 pointless	 trying	 to	 convince	 the	 nurse	 otherwise.	 She	 at	 least knew	the	truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	are	the	rest	of	them?	Do	you	know	where	they	were	making	for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	they	were	headed	east	towards	Christchurch.	They’ll	most	likely	find</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Sister	 Theodora	 said	 you	 would	 come	 looking	 for	 Stella	 and	 I	 was	 to	 give you	 this	 note	 when	 I	 saw	 you.”	 She	 reached	 into	 the	 folds	 of	 her	 apron.	 Deep inside	a	front	pocket	was	a	folded	note	that	she	held	out	to	Riley	with	a	shaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand.	 Riley	 was	 intrigued	 and	 took	 the	 single	 side	 of	 hotel	 stationery	 with	 its distinctive	 masthead	 in	 her	 gloved	 fingers.	 She	 opened	 it	 slowly	 to	 reveal sculpted	words,	loops	and	letters	written	in	the	sister’s	handwriting.	It	reminded</p>

The note	 was	 addressed	 to	 her	 personally,	 but	 the	 bulk	 of	 the	 text	 was	 made	 up	 of two	 extracts	 from	 the	 Bible	 that	 she	 didn’t	 recognise	 immediately,	 but	 both sounded	familiar. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p254"></a><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Fifty-eight</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 a	 leisurely	 breakfast	 and	 friendly	 inquisition,	 Terra	 and	 Briggs	 adjourned to	 a	 well-appointed	 drawing	 room	 in	 one	 of	 the	 oldest	 parts	 of	 Carisbrooke Castle.	 He	 held	 the	 door	 open	 and	 waited	 for	 her	 to	 enter.	 Following	 close behind	was	the	enormous	bulk	of	one	of	his	most	trusted	deputies.	Earlier,	Terra</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	witnessed	Briggs	speaking	with	the	man	with	the	extravagant	tattoos	on	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">face	with	what	appeared	to	be	genuine	tenderness,	his	arm	around	his	shoulder</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	 a	 brother,	 sharing	 a	 joke.	 The	 man’s	 name	 was	 Hatch	 or	 Hutch.	 Anyway, something	that	made	her	think	of	rabbits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 fire,	 recently	 lit,	 crackled	 and	 spat	 sparks	 in	 the	 enormous	 hearth	 stacked with	logs	and	kindling	that	was	just	beginning	to	catch.	She	could	see	scrunched-up	 paper	 still	 burning	 at	 its	 core.	 To	 the	 right	 of	 the	 fire	 was	 a	 large	 pile	 of newspapers.	She	angled	her	head,	trying	to	make	out	the	masthead,	cover	picture</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	headline	on	the	topmost	copy.	It	was	dated	more	than	two	years	ago	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	start	of	the	outbreak.	She	scanned	the	copy.	Rumours	of	a	terrorist	attack, </p>
<p class="calibre1">photos	 of	 a	 royal	 baby,	 political	 crisis.	 It	 had	 been	 several	 months	 since	 she’d read	 a	 magazine	 or	 paper.	 At	 Hurst,	 Scottie	 had	 made	 a	 habit	 of	 collecting hundreds	of	broadsheets,	local	papers,	trade	journals,	science	papers	and	fashion</p>
<p class="calibre1">magazines,	chronicling	the	chaos	of	the	outbreak.	The	first	early	warning	signs</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 been	 ignored.	 Dismissed	 as	 localised	 winter	 flu	 spikes,	 of	 little	 concern	 to the	 developed	 world.	 As	 the	 scale	 of	 the	 outbreak	 became	 clear,	 wild	 theories proliferated.	The	final	issues	of	 <i class="calibre4">The	Times</i>	 and	  <i class="calibre4">The	 Telegraph</i>	 had	 been	 single-sheet	publications	as	printing	works	and	newspaper	offices	closed	in	short	order. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terra	 reflected	 on	 the	 fact	 that	 the	 world	 had	 become	 an	 altogether	 smaller place.	 So	 little	 was	 known	 of	 what	 was	 happening	 elsewhere	 beyond	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediate	 environment.	 Nowadays	 people	 tended	 to	 view	 the	 world	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">blinkers	 on,	 busying	 themselves	 with	 what	 was	 in	 front	 of	 their	 noses.	 There seemed	little	point	worrying	about	what	lay	beyond.	She	was	reminded	of	Jack’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">mantra	that	one	of	the	keys	to	happiness	was	to	never	worry	about	things	outside</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	control.	Concentrate	on	the	here	and	now,	or	at	least	that’s	what	Jack	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">always	told	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	chill	in	the	air	that	the	fire	had	not	quite	dispelled.	Terra	stood</p>
<p class="calibre1">barefoot,	 her	 back	 to	 the	 flames.	 She	 scrunched	 her	 toes	 in	 the	 deep	 pile	 of	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p255"></a>large	 red	 rug,	 marked	 by	 small	 burn	 holes	 where	 coals	 had	 fallen	 from	 an unattended	 grate.	 The	 room	 was	 impressive,	 with	 portraits	 of	 distinguished noblemen	 that	 graced	 the	 walls.	 A	 framed	 watercolour	 had	 been	 left	 propped against	 a	 bookshelf,	 jostling	 for	 space	 with	 statues	 and	 trophies	 collecting	 dust against	the	walls,	presumably	stolen	from	the	surrounding	area	by	Briggs’s	men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	corner,	in	pride	of	place,	stood	a	suit	of	armour	in	richly	polished	metal,	a mace	in	one	hand	together	with	a	ball	and	chain	in	the	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Briggs	 closed	 the	 oak-framed	 door	 and	 slumped	 into	 his	 favourite	 armchair set	 nearest	 the	 fire.	 He	 watched	 Terra	 as	 she	 moved	 around	 the	 room,	 noting where	 she	 lingered,	 what	 she	 picked	 up,	 and	 what	 she	 ignored	 in	 his	 growing collection	of	looted	artworks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 felt	 his	 eyes	 following	 her	 and	 accentuated	 the	 sway	 of	 her	 hips	 as	 she walked,	planting	her	bare	feet	carefully	to	avoid	pieces	of	glass	on	the	wooden</p>
<p class="calibre1">floor.	 She	 made	 sure	 he	 was	 watching	 closely	 and	 retained	 his	 attention	 by flicking	her	head	coquettishly	to	the	left,	making	eye	contact	over	her	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	enjoying	this	fleeting	sense	of	power	and	sway	she	held	over	him.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	 she	 sensed	 conflict,	 as	 if	 he	 was	 fighting	 his	 instinct	 to	 trust	 her.	 She smiled	inwardly,	encouraged	by	his	uncertainty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	waited	for	her	to	finish	her	turn	around	the	room,	enjoying	the	contours	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	dress	and	the	way	it	hugged	her	figure,	before	patting	his	lap,	inviting	her	to join	 him.	 She	 blushed	 and	 tried	 to	 laugh	 off	 his	 request,	 but	 quickly	 realised from	the	humourless	expression	that,	on	this	occasion,	he	would	not	take	no	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 approached	 the	 armchair	 but	 hesitated,	 looking	 awkwardly	 at	 him.	 It</p>
<p class="calibre1">reminded	her	of	unwanted	attentions	from	an	affectionate	relative	when	she	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">young.	 She	 remembered	 Uncle	 Sebastian	 at	 Christmas	 time,	 insisting	 that	 she still	sit	on	his	lap,	despite	being	a	pubescent	teenager.	She	shuddered,	even	after all	 these	 years,	 thinking	 of	 his	 arm	 snaking	 around	 her	 waist,	 his	 coarse	 hands massaging	her	shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Briggs	patted	his	knee	again.	“Come	on.	I’m	not	going	to	bite.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 modestly	 perched	 on	 his	 knee,	 but	 he	 grabbed	 her	 waist	 and	 quickly</p>
<p class="calibre1">manhandled	 her	 across	 his	 lap.	 She	 was	 powerfully	 aware	 of	 the	 smell	 of	 the man.	 He	 was	 in	 need	 of	 a	 good	 bath.	 She	 did	 her	 best	 to	 remain	 calm	 as	 he studied	 his	 prize	 up	 close,	 drinking	 her	 in,	 angling	 her	 chin	 to	 left	 and	 right, studying	the	contours	of	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 folds	 of	 her	 cardigan	 sleeve	 she	 adjusted	 a	 small	 blade	 she	 had smuggled	from	the	breakfast	table.	It	was	a	wooden-handled	kitchen	knife	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">serrated	 edge.	 Hutch	 had	 been	 careless	 leaving	 a	 blade	 this	 sharp	 within	 reach and	not	realising	its	absence	on	clearing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p256"></a>She	might	never	get	this	close	to	Briggs	again.	His	neck	was	thickly	muscled above	a	black	sweater,	his	bulging	vein	close	enough	to	bite.	She	summoned	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">courage	 to	 do	 the	 deed,	 to	 get	 it	 over	 with,	 to	 rid	 the	 world	 of	 this	 tyrant.	 The neck	 was	 her	 best	 option.	 An	 unsurvivable	 wound.	 A	 clean	 kill.	 A	 quick	 stab with	the	knife	and	it	would	all	be	over	in	seconds.	And	yet,	she	found	reasons	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">defer.	Could	she	really	kill	someone	in	cold	blood? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 smiled	 at	 her,	 enjoying	 her	 discomfort,	 but	 growing	 impatient	 at	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">reluctance,	her	body	stiff	and	tense,	unresponsive	to	his	touch.	The	smile	faded</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	his	lips	and	turned	into	a	snarl	as	he	bared	his	teeth	and	whispered,	“You	need</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	learn,	woman.	Learn	to	appreciate	me.”	He	pulled	her	closer.	His	mouth	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">right	 next	 to	 her	 cheek,	 his	 breath	 sour	 and	 hot.	 His	 lips	 caressed	 her	 ear	 lobe, sucking	 at	 the	 stud	 earring	 she	 wore,	 nibbling	 it	 gently	 between	 his	 teeth.	 She fought	to	maintain	control,	her	heart	racing.	He	mistook	her	shortness	of	breath</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	excitement	and	continued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	wooden	hilt	of	the	knife	slipped	against	her	wrist	and	the	blade	caught	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 flesh	 of	 her	 index	 finger.	 With	 the	 weight	 of	 his	 body	 against	 her	 arm,	 the knife	threatened	to	break	the	skin	and	draw	blood.	Her	moment	had	come,	if	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	free	her	hand.	Strike	now	or	lose	the	chance	forever.	It	would	be	over	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 a	 knock	 at	 the	 door	 and	 without	 waiting	 for	 an	 answer,	 one	 of Briggs’s	 henchmen	 strode	 in,	 followed	 by	 Victor,	 the	 first	 officer	 from	 the <i class="calibre4">Maersk	Charlotte</i>.	Briggs	looked	affronted	by	this	interruption,	his	head	buried in	 Terra’s	 neck.	 He	 loosened	 his	 grip	 slightly	 and	 Terra	 took	 advantage	 of	 the distraction,	springing	to	her	feet	before	he	could	grab	her	wrist	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 a	 smirk	 on	 Victor’s	 lips	 as	 his	 eyes	 flicked	 from	 Terra	 back	 to Briggs,	 conscious	 he	 was	 interrupting	 this	 moment	 of	 intimacy,	 enjoying	 her discomfort	as	she	stood	awkwardly,	hands	fidgeting	like	a	frightened	child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 do	 you	 want,	 Victor?	 Don’t	 you	 have	 somewhere	 else	 to	 be?”	 said</p>
<p class="calibre1">Briggs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry.	 I	 can	 see	 you’re	 busy.	 I	 won’t	 keep	 you	 long.	 I’ve	 just	 finished interrogating	 the	 others.	 They	 know	 nothing.	 Next	 time,	 we	 need	 to	 get	 an American.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 voice	 was	 heavily	 accented,	 East	 European,	 certainly.	 Terra	 couldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">place	 it.	 Baltic	 states,	 former	 Soviet	 Union.	 Latvian	 or	 Estonian,	 she	 guessed, waiting	 for	 Victor	 to	 continue,	 wondering	 how	 many	 other	 hostages	 they	 had taken	from	Osborne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	you	should	know	the	 <i class="calibre4">Maersk	Charlotte</i>	is	on	the	move,”	he	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	 weighed	 anchor	 this	 morning	 and	 is	 heading	 into	 Southampton	 docks	 to begin	 unloading.	 The	 Royal	 Navy	 has	 rigged	 up	 power	 to	 one	 of	 the	 giant</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p257"></a>cranes.	They	will	 begin	unloading	the	 humanitarian	supplies,	unless	 that	is,	we choose	to	stop	them.	Construction	of	the	first	of	the	refugee	centres	is	expected</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	island	within	the	week.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,	 good.	 Just	 like	 we	 planned.	 And	 our	 men?	 Are	 they	 in	 position?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">asked	Briggs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	are,	as	you	instructed.	We	have	made	contact	with	the	hospital.	Copper</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 now	 in	 charge.	 It	 would	 seem	 that	 his	 boss	 met	 with	 an	 untimely	 accident during	their	failed	attack	on	Hurst.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	careless.	And	this	new	man,	Copper,	is	he	someone	we	can	do	business</p>
<p class="calibre1">with?	Can	he	be	trusted?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	 yes,	 he	 is	 a	 policeman.	 None	 more	 trustworthy,	 no?	 He	 and	 I	 go	 way back.	He	should	prove	a	useful	ally.	He	tells	me	their	doctors	are	working	on	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">prototype	vaccine.	They	have	already	synthesised	a	strain	of	the	virus,	portable</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 deadly.	 They	 are	 conducting	 clinical	 trials	 to	 perfect	 them.	 He	 can	 start sending	us	samples	as	soon	as	we’re	ready.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Victor	was	about	to	divulge	further	details	when	he	paused,	his	mouth	half-</p>
<p class="calibre1">open.	 His	 eyes	 darted	 across	 to	 Terra	 who	 was	 listening	 to	 the	 exchange, betrayed	by	a	look	of	concern	she	failed	to	hide	on	learning	about	the	attack	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hurst,	her	thoughts	turning	to	Jack	and	the	rest	of	the	team. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	her?	Are	we	to	trust	her?	Surely,	her	loyalties	lie	with	Hurst	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Americans.	You	should	not	be	fooled	by	her	kisses.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terra	made	as	if	to	speak,	to	defend	herself	at	Victor’s	accusations,	throwing</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 arms	 wide	 in	 a	 gesture	 of	 innocence.	 Victor	 nodded	 to	 the	 henchman	 who grabbed	Terra	by	the	wrist,	bending	her	arm	back	until	she	winced.	He	patted	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	 for	 concealed	 weapons	 and	 wrestled	 the	 small	 kitchen	 knife	 from	 her sleeve	and	held	it	up	for	Briggs	to	see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	one	you	must	watch	like	a	hawk.	She	is	not	to	be	trusted.	One	of	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">men	 saw	 her	 take	 this	 earlier,	 but	 failed	 to	 mention	 it	 till	 just	 now.	 You	 were lucky	I	got	here	when	I	did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Victor	presented	the	handle	of	the	knife	to	Briggs	who	took	it	and	weighed	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 size,	 patting	 it	 while	 he	 nodded,	 fixing	 Terra	 with	 a	 look	 of	 reproach.	 He made	a	low	tutting	sound	and	got	wearily	to	his	feet,	seemingly	disappointed	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	small	act	of	treachery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 lucky	 you	 were	 here,	 Victor.	 Your	 instincts	 serve	 you	 well,	 unlike	 you two,	you	useless	bastards,”	he	said,	gesturing	towards	his	bodyguards	who	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">doing	 their	 best	 to	 blame	 each	 other.	 “It’s	 stuffy	 in	 here.	 Let’s	 take	 some	 air.	 I can’t	 think	 in	 this	 room.	 Victor,	 Terra,	 Hatch,	 follow	 me.	 There’s	 something	 I want	to	show	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	opened	the	door	and	waited	for	the	three	others	to	head	out	into	the	front</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p258"></a>lobby	 area	 and	 courtyard	 beyond.	 Outside	 it	 had	 stopped	 drizzling.	 Rainwater was	 dripping	 from	 roofs	 and	 gutters,	 collecting	 in	 large	 barrels	 positioned underneath	 drain	 pipes.	 Their	 shoes	 crunched	 across	 the	 wet	 gravel.	 Terra	 was still	shoeless	and	tiptoed	in	bare	feet,	pushed	from	behind	when	her	pace	slowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	climbed	the	steep	steps	covered	with	moss	through	a	large	archway	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	ramparts	of	the	old	keep	and	the	walls	that	ran	along	the	top.	The	view	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">here	 was	 magnificent,	 stretching	 across	 the	 island.	 The	 city	 of	 Portsmouth	 was visible	in	the	distance	to	their	right	across	the	Solent.	To	the	south	and	west	were sweeping	 fields	 and	 countryside,	 the	 houses	 and	 streets	 of	 Newport	 set	 out below.	 Briggs	 stopped	 at	 the	 highest	 point,	 leaning	 against	 the	 railing,	 out	 of breath,	waiting	for	the	others	to	join	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 thin	 wooden	 rail	 was	 all	 that	 stood	 between	 them	 and	 a	 vertical	 drop some	hundred	feet	or	so	down	to	the	ruins	of	buildings	nestled	against	the	castle</p>
<p class="calibre1">walls	 below,	 shrouded	 in	 bushes	 and	 trees.	 He	 put	 his	 arm	 around	 Terra’s shoulders,	pulling	her	towards	him.	His	fingers	kneaded	the	muscles	at	the	base</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	her	neck.	She	flinched,	trembling	slightly	but	made	no	attempt	to	move	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	see,	Terra?”	He	extended	his	arm	over	the	sweeping	landscape</p>
<p class="calibre1">stretching	into	the	distance.	She	stayed	silent,	terrified.	“What	do	you	see	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	look	at	this	beautiful	island?	I’ll	tell	you.	Opportunity.”	He	smiled,	grasping the	air	with	his	hand.	He	squeezed	her	around	the	waist	before	pushing	her	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">roughly.	“But	you	disappoint	me,	Terra.”	He	let	his	words	hang	for	a	couple	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">seconds	before	continuing.	“I	don’t	like	disappointment.	I	have	no	time	for	liars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	loyalty,	without	trust,	there	is	nothing.	Do	you	understand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terra	 nodded,	 feeling	 the	 wooden	 rail	 give	 a	 little	 as	 she	 leaned	 against	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly	she	felt	very	afraid,	staring	down	into	the	abyss	beneath	her	bare	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	gripped	the	edge	of	the	stones	with	her	toes	and	swallowed	hard.	She	fully</p>
<p class="calibre1">expected	 this	 to	 be	 her	 last	 breath	 before	 tumbling	 over	 to	 meet	 her	 maker, consoling	 herself	 that	 at	 least	 it	 would	 be	 a	 quick	 end.	 A	 short	 fall	 and	 then nothing.	The	pain	would	be	momentary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	and	I	could	have	been	something.	We	could	have	ruled	this	island	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">King	and	Queen.	Don’t	you	see	that?	But	how	can	I	ever	trust	you	again?”	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">shook	his	head,	staring	out	over	the	countryside	beyond.	She	started	to	apologise</p>
<p class="calibre1">but	he	raised	a	finger	to	silence	her.	“Hatch,	get	over	here.”	He	gestured	towards</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	gentle	giant	of	a	man,	who	wandered	closer.	“How	long	have	we	known	each</p>
<p class="calibre1">other?	Five,	no,	six	years.	You,	my	friend,	have	one	job.	You	know	what	it	is?	To</p>
<p class="calibre1">ensure	my	safety.	To	stop	people	like	her	trying	to	do	me	harm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	boss,	it	was	like	this…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	explanation	needed,	Hatch.	You	did	your	best.	I	get	that.	I	can’t	ask	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">more.	 And	 yet	 your	 best	 is	 not	 good	 enough.	 Not	 by	 a	 long	 stretch	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p259"></a>imagination.	 You	 let	 this,	 this	 feeble	 woman,	 smuggle	 a	 knife	 in	 close	 without anyone	even	noticing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,	 boss,	 it	 won’t	 happen	 again.”	 He	 was	 all	 of	 six	 feet	 four	 inches	 and yet	he	looked	like	a	scolded	schoolboy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	right,	Hatch,	it	won’t	happen	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Briggs	 stepped	 back	 and	 braced	 himself	 against	 the	 raised	 outer	 wall	 of	 the castle	 and	 kicked	 hard	 into	 the	 small	 of	 Hatch’s	 back.	 Despite	 his	 size,	 he	 was off	balance	and	the	railing	did	little	to	arrest	his	forward	momentum.	He	crashed</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	 the	 barrier	 and	 plummeted	 some	 hundred	 feet	 down	 on	 to	 the	 rocks below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terra	 and	 Victor	 followed	 his	 flailing	 arms	 and	 brief	 fall,	 hearing	 his	 skull crack	against	the	stone	foundations	of	a	storage	shed.	Terra	could	just	make	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	slow	trickle	of	blood	from	a	head	wound	dripping	onto	the	white	stone	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">start	pooling	beneath	his	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Briggs	turned	to	face	Victor.	“Victor.	Looks	like	a	position	in	my	organisation</p>
<p class="calibre1">has	just	opened	up.	Do	you	want	in?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Victor	was	staring	down	at	the	man’s	body	below,	the	left	foot	still	twitching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 looked	 up	 into	 Briggs’s	 expressionless	 eyes	 and	 nodded.	 Briggs	 turned	 his back	on	them	and	started	walking	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 can	 start	 by	 clearing	 up	 that	 mess.	 Get	 that	 railing	 fixed,	 will	 you?	 It was	an	accident	waiting	to	happen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Victor	 nodded	 and	 mumbled	 his	 assent,	 hurrying	 after	 his	 new	 boss.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">stopped	 and	 turned	 to	 find	 Terra	 still	 staring	 at	 the	 crumpled	 body	 below,	 its shape	twisted	awkwardly,	broken	against	the	rock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	 on.	 That’s	 enough	 excitement	 for	 one	 day.	 Let’s	 get	 you	 inside	 and back	in	your	cell.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terra	looked	up	with	tears	in	her	eyes	as	she	shivered	in	the	morning	breeze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 took	 a	 step	 towards	 the	 edge,	 backing	 away	 from	 him.	 “Don’t	 come	 any closer	or	I’ll	jump.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Victor	stared	at	her	motionless.	“We	both	know	that’s	not	going	to	happen,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	said,	mocking	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	 do	 it.	 Don’t	 think	 I’m	 not	 capable,”	 said	 Terra	 shaking	 her	 head,	 her whole	body	trembling	with	fear	and	adrenaline. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I	know	you’re	capable,	Terra.	But	I	also	know	that	you	won’t	jump.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	be	so	sure.	You	don’t	know	what	I’ve	done	to	survive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 like	 me.	 An	 opportunist.	 You’ve	 survived	 because	 you	 evolve	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">adapt,	 stay	 close	 to	 those	 in	 power.	 Bide	 your	 time,	 make	 the	 most	 of	 a	 good thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	nothing	about	me.	Don’t	underestimate	me,	Victor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p260"></a>“You’re	 wrong.	 I	 hold	 you	 in	 the	 highest	 regard.”	 She	 looked	 confused	 and relaxed	a	fraction,	puzzling	over	his	words.	“Things	are	about	to	get	interesting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 I	 was	 you,	 I’d	 stick	 around.	 Don’t	 give	 up	 now,	 just	 when	 you’ve	 landed yourself	a	position	of	influence.	Those	others	he	took.	The	hostages.	They	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">worthless,	except	to	trade	or	use	as	human	shields	perhaps.	Whereas	you,	Terra. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’re	the	key	to	all	this.	The	Queen	of	Hurst,	he	calls	you.	You	could	help	unite</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	disparate	groups.	He	needs	you.	Stay	close	to	Briggs	and	you’ll	be	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart	 of	 this	 growing	 rebellion.	 Just	 imagine,	 riches	 and	 power	 beyond	 your wildest	dreams.	If	we	work	together	we	can	rule	this	new	world.	It’s	ours	for	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">She	 put	 her	 hand	 back	 against	 the	 railing	 post	 behind	 her,	 blinking	 back	 at him,	digesting	his	offer	of	partnership.	Victor	seized	his	chance	and	reached	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	grab	her	sleeve	before	she	could	react. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	 touch	 me.	 You’re	 wrong.	 You’re	 as	 bad	 as	 the	 rest	 of	 them.	 You	 all deserve	to	die.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 slapped	 her	 hard	 across	 the	 face	 and	 hauled	 her	 away	 from	 the	 edge, dragging	 her	 back	 towards	 the	 stairs	 to	 the	 main	 building.	 Terra	 took	 one	 last look	across	the	countryside	to	the	north	and	west.	She	couldn’t	see	Hurst	but	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagined	Jack	and	Zed	standing	on	top	of	the	Gun	Tower	in	the	distance.	If	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 could	 get	 a	 message	 to	 them,	 tell	 them	 where	 she	 was.	 She	 had	 to	 believe they	would	come	for	her.	In	the	meantime,	she	must	bide	her	time,	do	what	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	to	stay	alive	and	regain	Briggs’s	trust,	whatever	it	took.	The	future	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">island,	 even	 the	 whole	 region,	 depended	 on	 her.	 Fail	 and	 nothing	 would	 stand between	Briggs	and	his	plan	for	chaos	and	disorder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	an	impossible	choice.	Bend	to	Briggs’s	will,	betray	everything	she	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">worked	so	hard	for.	And	for	what,	wealth	and	power?	What	did	they	really	count</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	versus	the	new	life	she	had	built	for	herself	at	Hurst?	And	yet	part	of	her	was silently	screaming	that	it	was	a	price	worth	paying,	wasn’t	it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	a	loud	sigh,	she	swallowed	her	pride	and	succumbed	to	logic.	She	gave</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	and	allowed	herself	to	be	hauled	back	to	her	cell.	There	would	be	no	shortage</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 hours	 to	 ponder	 her	 next	 move.	 It	 was	 time	 for	 metamorphosis,	 for	 the	 real Terra	to	emerge	and	spread	her	wings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Was	it	her	imagination	or	could	she	hear	the	sound	of	breaking	waves,	carried</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 wind?	 Perhaps	 it	 was	 the	 remnants	 of	 the	 late	 spring	 storm	 that	 had battered	 the	 island	 over	 the	 past	 week,	 rollers	 surging	 in	 from	 the	 English Channel.	The	sound	was	distant	yet	somehow	familiar	and	soothing.	It	reminded</p>

<p class="calibre1">Riley	sat	down	next	to	Adele,	supportively	holding	her	hand,	while	the	little	girl</p>
<p class="calibre1">buried	her	face	into	her	shoulder.	The	medical	officer	from	the	 <i class="calibre4">Chester</i>	swabbed the	 inside	 of	 Adele’s	 arm	 with	 a	 cotton	 ball	 soaked	 in	 alcohol.	 He	 tapped	 two fingers	against	her	inner	arm	and	inserted	the	needle	into	a	raised	vein. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’ll	all	be	over	in	a	minute.”	The	doctor	smiled	as	the	syringe	slowly	filled</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 the	 little	 girl’s	 blood	 they	 hoped	 would	 help	 them	 understand	 more	 about the	 virus.	 He	 withdrew	 the	 needle,	 keeping	 the	 pressure	 on	 the	 puncture	 mark with	his	gloved	finger,	and	stuck	a	plaster	over	the	expanding	pinprick	of	blood, </p>
<p class="calibre1">handing	the	syringe	to	his	assistant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley’s	thoughts	were	elsewhere.	She	couldn't	stop	thinking	about	Stella	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	she	had	seen	at	the	hotel.	After	the	fire,	an	outbreak	of	the	virus	was	a	cruel blow.	She	had	to	believe	that	Stella	was	indeed	immune,	as	was	being	suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 ride	 home	 in	 the	 helicopter	 had	 been	 in	 silence.	 There	 was	 nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">Peterson	could	say	that	could	possibly	make	things	better,	so	he	gave	up	and	left</p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	to	her	dark	thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	 need	 to	 get	 this	 blood	 sample	 to	 Professor	 Nichols’s	 team	 at	 St. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mary’s	as	soon	as	possible.	Can	you	make	the	arrangements,	please?”	the	doctor</p>
<p class="calibre1">asked	his	assistant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	back	to	face	Adele	who	was	rubbing	her	throbbing	arm,	keeping	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">elevated.	 He	 leaned	 in	 closer	 and	 lowered	 his	 voice.	 He	 was	 used	 to	 treating burly	marines	and	tattooed	engineers,	so	was	doing	his	best	to	adjust	his	bedside</p>
<p class="calibre1">manner.	 His	 breath	 was	 stale	 and	 stank	 of	 coffee.	 It	 was	 making	 the	 little	 girl screw	up	her	face	in	disgust.	Riley	nudged	her	in	the	ribs	and	told	her	to	behave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	 been	 very	 brave,	 young	 lady.	 You	 know	 you’re	 a	 very	 special	 girl, Adele.	 There’s	 a	 good	 chance	 that	 your	 blood	 can	 teach	 us	 how	 to	 stop	 people getting	sick.	What	do	you	think	of	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	what	the	other	doctors	told	me	back	at	the	hospital,	right	before	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">hurt	me.	Are	you	going	to	hurt	me	too?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 doctor	 exchanged	 puzzled	 glances	 with	 Riley	 and	 the	 nurse	 before</p>
<p class="calibre1">reassuring	 Adele.	 “No,	 child,	 no	 one’s	 going	 to	 hurt	 you.	 We’re	 going	 to	 look after	 you	 and	 make	 sure	 no	 bad	 men	 hurt	 you	 ever	 again.	 You’re	 safe	 here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Okay?”	The	doctor	noticed	the	rabbit's	foot	key	ring	the	girl	was	clutching	in	her</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p262"></a>right	hand.	“That's	a	nice	key	ring.	Did	someone	give	it	to	you?	Your	mummy	or daddy	 maybe?”	 he	 asked	 with	 interest,	 turning	 it	 over	 in	 his	 hand.	 It	 felt surprisingly	real	to	the	touch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	 one	 gave	 it	 to	 me.	 I	 made	 it	 myself,”	 she	 responded	 in	 a	 flat	 voice.	 “I couldn't	 look	 after	 him	 any	 more	 and	 knew	 he	 would	 die,	 so	 we	 ate	 him	 and	 I kept	his	foot	as	a	memento.	It	brings	me	luck.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 doctor	 dropped	 the	 key	 ring	 into	 her	 palm,	 puzzled	 by	 her	 detachment, wondering	at	how	desensitised	she	had	become.	He	shrugged	his	shoulders	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">patted	her	on	the	shoulder	with	a	wry	smile.	“Well,	I	sure	hope	he	brings	you	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lot	of	luck.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	thanked	the	doctor	and	led	Adele	down	the	corridor	and	outside	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">castle	courtyard	where	some	of	the	other	children	were	playing	a	noisy	game	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">baseball	 with	 bored-looking	 grown-ups.	 Riley	 and	 Adele	 stopped	 to	 watch	 as Toby	whacked	the	ball	high	into	the	air,	threw	down	his	bat	and	set	off	to	first</p>
<p class="calibre1">base.	The	ball	came	rolling	to	a	stop	to	their	right	as	two	boys	raced	to	retrieve</p>
<p class="calibre1">it.	 All	 eyes	 turned	 in	 their	 direction.	 Adele	 looked	 up	 at	 Riley	 for	 permission before	hurrying	after	the	ball	and	athletically	throwing	it	back	over	the	head	of	a small	boy	with	foppish	blonde	hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nice	 throw,”	 he	 muttered	 begrudgingly	 before	 running	 back	 to	 join	 the</p>

</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
Above	 them	 on	 the	 roof	 of	 the	 Gun	 Tower,	 Zed	 had	 clambered	 through	 the<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">narrow	opening	from	the	floor	below.	He	found	Jack	scanning	the	horizon	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	old	pair	of	binoculars,	his	mop	of	greying	hair	flattened	by	the	wind.	Jack	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">lingering	over	the	superstructure	of	the	 <i class="calibre4">Chester</i>	anchored	a	couple	of	miles	away in	the	main	channel.	In	characteristic	pose,	he	had	his	glasses	pushed	high	on	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">forehead.	 When	 Zed	 closed	 his	 eyes,	 this	 was	 his	 residual	 mental	 image	 of	 the man.	Jack	sensed	Zed’s	presence	to	his	right	and	flicked	his	eyes	in	his	direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’s	 the	 arm?	 Feeling	 better?	 Or	 are	 you	 planning	 on	 staying	 the	 rest	 of the	week	in	bed?”	said	Jack	tersely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed’s	eyes	narrowed.	He	was	on	the	verge	of	venting	about	everything	he	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">done	for	Hurst,	before	remembering	that	Jack	was	just	winding	him	up,	as	usual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 took	 a	 deep	 breath,	 joined	 him	 at	 the	 rail,	 looking	 out	 to	 sea.	 “I’ve	 slept enough,	 thanks.	 Liz	 says	 I’m	 as	 good	 as	 new.”	 He	 nudged	 Jack	 in	 the	 ribs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’s	the	shoulder,	old	man?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sore.	Stitches	will	come	out	in	a	few	weeks.	Hey,	Zed,”	said	Jack,	changing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	subject,	“I	need	someone	to	take	Adele	to	the	hospital	at	St	Mary’s.	There’s	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p263"></a>professor	 there	 who	 wants	 to	 run	 some	 more	 tests.	 He’s	 got	 a	 lab	 set	 up	 and	 a team	ready	to	start	work.	You	up	for	a	trip?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,	no	problem.	Sounds	right	up	my	street.	I’d	like	to	meet	the	professor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ask	 him	 some	 questions,”	 he	 said	 to	 a	 puzzled	 Jack.	 Zed	 swallowed	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">recovered.	 “You	 know	 me.	 I	 can’t	 stand	 being	 cooped	 up.	 Getting	 cabin	 fever already.	Would	be	good	to	get	back	out	there.	Can	you	spare	Riley	as	well?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	see	why	not.	Take	the	 <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>.	Sam	will	go	with	you	to	helm	the	boat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	is,	if	you	don’t	mind	listening	to	the	Bee	Gees	all	the	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	moment	of	silence	between	them	as	both	stared	out	east,	lost	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 separate	 thoughts.	 Dark	 clouds	 had	 gathered	 in	 the	 distance	 to	 the	 south heading	towards	the	island,	but	it	looked	as	if	they	would	escape	the	worst	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">weather	at	Hurst. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beyond	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Chester</i>	 lay	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Maersk	 Charlotte</i>,	 just	 visible	 towards Southampton,	 her	 bulk	 unmistakeable	 against	 the	 shoreline	 and	 the	 inlet	 to	 the Beaulieu	 River.	 Zed	 wondered	 how	 Anders	 had	 taken	 Victor’s	 treachery.	 Jack said	he	never	trusted	that	guy.	His	eyes	were	just	a	little	bit	too	close	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suspicious	eyebrows	that	met	in	the	middle,	Zed	knew	the	type	too	well.	A	gun</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	hire,	loyalty	for	sale	to	the	highest	bidder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 spotted	 something	 in	 the	 distance	 and	 asked	 Jack	 to	 pass	 him	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">binoculars.	 It	 took	 a	 moment	 to	 find	 it	 again,	 but	 there	 it	 was,	 a	 grey	 patrol vessel	powering	towards	them,	hammering	into	the	waves	and	eastward-flowing</p>
<p class="calibre1">tide.	He	passed	the	binoculars	back	to	Jack	who	identified	the	ship	as	an	Archer</p>
<p class="calibre1">class	 patrol	 vessel,	 though	 it	 was	 relatively	 uncommon	 in	 these	 waters.	 On	 the flying	 bridge,	 he	 picked	 out	 two	 figures	 bracing	 themselves	 as	 spray	 shot	 high into	the	air	as	they	ploughed	into	the	crest	of	a	new	wave.	At	the	back	of	the	ship was	a	white	ensign.	It	was	Royal	Navy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	some	static	and	the	crackle	of	a	voice	hailing	them	over	the	radio. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	unclipped	the	walkie-talkie	from	his	belt	and	turned	up	the	volume. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hurst	 Castle,	 Hurst	 Castle,	 this	 is	 Royal	 Navy	 patrol	 vessel	  <i class="calibre4">HMS	 Marker</i>, come	in,	over?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">HMS	Marker</i>,	this	is	Hurst	Castle.	Go	ahead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	morning,	Hurst,	this	is	Captain	Armstrong.	Do	we	have	permission	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">come	ashore?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Absolutely.	I’ll	get	the	kitchen	to	put	the	kettle	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Copy	 that.	 ETA	 ten	 minutes	 at	 current	 course	 and	 speed.	 We	 have	 Captain Anders	with	us	too.	He	tells	me	he’s	rather	partial	to	Highland	shortbread	if	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	any.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 grinned	 at	 Zed,	 who	 was	 shaking	 his	 head.	 “We’ll	 take	 a	 look.	 No</p>
<p class="calibre1">promises,	mind.	Hurst,	out.”	He	tucked	the	radio	back	on	his	belt	clip.	“Bloody</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p264"></a>navy	types.	Always	inviting	themselves	over	for	tea	and	biscuits.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shouldn’t	 they	 be	 protecting	 the	 island	 or	 something?”	 said	 Zed</p>
<p class="calibre1">sarcastically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	need,	I	expect.	With	the	 <i class="calibre4">USS	Chester</i>	moored	up	off	the	island,	no	one’s going	to	be	stupid	enough	to	attack.	They	have	enough	firepower	to	keep	us	safe, </p>
<p class="calibre1">for	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	 do	 you	 figure	 that	 out?	 What	 use	 is	 a	 destroyer	 against	 a	 virus	 and	 a bunch	of	terrorists	hell-bent	on	disrupting	relief	operations?”	scoffed	Zed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 wouldn’t	 be	 so	 sure.	 The	 Americans	 have	 already	 made	 a	 difference, </p>
<p class="calibre1">maybe	 even	 turned	 the	 tide.	 Think	 back	 even	 a	 few	 days	 and	 we	 were	 just	 a bunch	of	dysfunctional	survivor	groups,	struggling	to	get	by.	Now,	there’s	a	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">real	sense	of	hope.	With	their	leadership,	they’ll	rally	others	to	the	cause.	Camp</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wight	is	a	fresh	start.	A	chance	to	rebuild.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 didn’t	 respond,	 lost	 in	 his	 thoughts	 and	 fears,	 refusing	 to	 believe	 that salvation	 was	 at	 hand,	 just	 because	 the	 Americans	 had	 showed	 up.	 Typical	 of Jack.	His	over	optimism	was	his	weakness,	always	seeing	the	best	in	a	situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 refusal	 to	 accept	 that	 the	 world	 had	 changed,	 that	 people	 had	 changed troubled	 Zed.	 He	 leaned	 over	 the	 parapet	 and	 watched	 the	 game	 of	 baseball going	on	below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	seemed	normal	again,	children	playing	and	laughing.	It	was	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 last	 few	 months	 had	 been	 forgotten.	 With	 the	 navy	 patrolling	 the	 seas, keeping	them	safe,	Zed	had	every	right	to	feel	secure.	And	yet,	he	felt	anything</p>
<p class="calibre1">but	safe.	What	Jack	had	told	him	about	King,	about	his	plans	to	use	the	virus	as	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">weapon	and	a	vaccine	as	leverage,	made	him	fear	for	the	future.	He	knew	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">too	 well	 the	 power	 that	 would	 command.	 The	 occupants	 of	 Hurst	 Castle	 could not	allow	themselves	to	relax	any	time	soon,	to	let	down	their	guard.	They	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	once	and	got	attacked.	Many	people	died	for	that	mistake.	Jack’s	pride	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">naivety	had	been	exposed.	It	made	Zed	question	Jack’s	leadership.	It	was	up	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	to	stay	sharp,	to	keep	others	on	their	toes,	to	stay	alert.	Keep	Jack	focused</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	grounded.	That	was	how	they	would	survive	all	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack’s	 voice	 interrupted	 Zed’s	 internal	 monologue.	 “Make	 yourself	 useful, </p>
<p class="calibre1">will	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,	Jack.	What	do	you	need?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	you	dust	off	that	old	flag	Greta	found	and	put	on	a	bit	of	a	show</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	our	navy	friends?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 chuckled	 at	 the	 thought.	 He	 wasn’t	 the	 slightest	 bit	 patriotic	 but	 it seemed	right	in	the	circumstances.	They	had	found	a	dusty	old	Union	Jack	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">locked	cupboard	that	had	waited	for	just	such	an	occasion.	He	retrieved	the	flag</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	shelf	downstairs	and	unfurled	it,	making	sure	it	was	the	right	way	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p265"></a>He	crossed	the	courtyard,	climbed	the	stairs	and	untied	the	halyard,	securing	the flag	top	and	bottom	before	hoisting	it	high	over	the	castle	battlements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	stepped	back,	admiring	his	handiwork,	the	Union	Jack	fluttering	proudly</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 strengthening	 wind.	 Jack	 watched	 the	 flag’s	 ascent,	 ignoring	 its	 faded colours	 and	 torn	 leading	 edge,	 momentarily	 overcome	 by	 a	 sense	 of	 pride	 and patriotism,	of	everything	they	had	achieved	thus	far.	It	felt	appropriate	to	honour the	moment	and	Jack	saluted	the	flag,	as	he	had	been	taught	so	many	years	ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sentimental	old	sod,”	muttered	Zed	under	his	breath,	spotting	Jack	with	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">arm	raised	in	salute. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
Riley	joined	Zed	on	the	upper	walkway	as	he	finished	lashing	the	flag	halyard	in<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">place	on	to	the	small	cleat	on	the	shaft	of	the	flagpole.	She	looked	him	up	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">down.	He’d	lost	weight,	she	thought.	His	trousers	seemed	to	bunch	at	the	hip,	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">belt	 a	 couple	 of	 notches	 tighter	 than	 before.	 She	 wandered	 over	 and	 they	 both stood	 perfectly	 still,	 studying	 the	 flag,	 heads	 tilted	 to	 one	 side,	 neither	 of	 them quite	sure	what	to	make	of	it	all.	Seeing	the	flag	flying	over	Hurst	seemed	both</p>
<p class="calibre1">incongruous	 and	 fitting	 all	 at	 the	 same	 time.	 The	 sense	 of	 history,	 shared purpose,	and	unity	the	flag	symbolised	felt	like	a	relic	from	another	age,	familiar and	 alien	 to	 this	 new	 generation	 living	 here,	 five	 centuries	 after	 the	 first.	 Zed shrugged	his	shoulders	and	made	as	if	to	leave,	taking	a	final	deep	breath	of	sea</p>
<p class="calibre1">air	before	heading	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	breath	seemed	to	catch	in	his	throat	and	he	was	suddenly	wracked	by	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fit	 of	 coughing.	 Riley’s	 head	 whipped	 round	 and	 watched	 with	 increasing</p>
<p class="calibre1">concern	as	he	seemed	to	fight	for	breath,	bent	double,	hacking	away.	The	words</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	Sister	Theodora	in	her	letter	were	still	fresh	in	her	mind	as	she	puzzled	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	 she	 had	 said	 about	 Zed	 being	 the	 carrier	 and	 source	 of	 the	 outbreak.	 She took	 a	 couple	 of	 steps	 away	 from	 him,	 as	 if	 somehow	 suddenly	 disconnected, their	bonds	fractured,	watching	his	coughing	with	a	strange	sense	of	detachment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 a	 final	 heave,	 gasping	 for	 breath,	 he	 gesticulated	 at	 Riley	 who	 ran	 up behind	 him	 and	 slapped	 him	 forcefully	 between	 the	 shoulder	 blades.	 Zed	 spat something	on	the	ground	and	straightened	up,	red	in	the	face.	She	slapped	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">again	for	good	measure	as	he	wiped	spittle	from	his	lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	 long	 have	 you	 had	 that	 cough?”	 she	 enquired	 suspiciously,	 backing</p>
<p class="calibre1">away	slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What,	that	little	thing?	I	swallowed	a	fly,	that’s	all,”	he	said,	his	voice	raspy</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	brittle.	“Bit	jumpy,	aren’t	we?	Scared	of	a	little	cough?	Teach	me	to	breathe</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 my	 mouth	 open.”	 She	 stared	 open-mouthed	 at	 him,	 caught	 somewhere</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p266"></a>between	 mirth	 and	 anger,	 not	 sure	 whether	 he	 was	 joking	 or	 not.	 “Seriously, Riley.	I’m	fine.	Trust	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Riley	 remembered	 that	 he	 always	 said	 that	 when	 he	 was	 lying,	 a	 smile</p>
<p class="calibre1">beginning	to	form	on	her	lips,	despite	her	not	being	completely	certain. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
Jack	 looked	 on	 from	 a	 distance,	 trying	 to	 read	 Riley’s	 expression	 as	 she<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">remonstrated	 with	 him,	 straining	 to	 hear	 the	 exchange	 that	 followed,	 but	 her words	were	lost	on	a	gust	of	wind.	A	rainsquall	heading	towards	them	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">island	 deposited	 its	 first	 drops	 on	 his	 bare	 head.	 Not	 liking	 what	 he	 saw,	 he hurried	 back	 inside	 to	 the	 comfort	 and	 warmth	 of	 the	 castle	 keep.	 The	 storm would	be	here	soon	enough. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
“What	 are	 you	 thinking?”	 asked	 Zed	 when	 he’d	 got	 his	 breath	 back,	 watching Riley	leaning	over	the	battlements,	surveying	the	island	across	the	waterway. <p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	thinking	about	Stella	again,”	she	said,	looking	down	at	her	feet.	“She’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	good	hands.	Those	nuns	will	look	after	her.	They	have	enough	hot	towels	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">volunteer	midwives	to	get	the	baby	out	safely.	Don’t	you	think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	nodded	then	laughed,	struck	by	a	question	that	had	been	niggling	him	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">never	 articulated	 before.	 “What	 if	 it’s	 a	 baby	 boy?”	 He	 grinned	 at	 Riley,	 like someone	 laughing	 at	 their	 own	 joke.	 Riley	 smiled	 back	 at	 him,	 a	 mischievous look	on	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	that	would	put	the	cat	amongst	the	pigeons,	eh?	Love	to	see	the	look</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	that	old	bat’s	face	when	she	finds	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	did	you	hear	about	Terra	being	taken	hostage?”	asked	Zed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	good	riddance,	I	say.	She	and	I	never	saw	eye	to	eye.	And	let	me	tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">you,	she	isn’t	your	biggest	fan	either.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Terra’s	all	right.	Come	on,	what’s	she	ever	done	to	you	anyway?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	such	a	fake.	Says	what	people	want	to	hear.	She’s	always	working	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">angle.	 Lies	 through	 her	 teeth	 most	 of	 the	 time.	 Trust	 me,	 it	 takes	 one	 to	 know one.	 Watch	 your	 back	 when	 she’s	 around.	 Seriously.”	 Zed	 didn’t	 look	 too</p>
<p class="calibre1">convinced	and	tried	to	change	the	subject. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	shout	from	the	far	end	of	the	complex,	followed	by	the	ringing</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	handbell.	Zed	and	Riley	raced	towards	the	western	wall	that	looked	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">along	the	shingle	spit	towards	the	village	of	Milford. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 was	 there	 first,	 along	 with	 several	 others,	 taking	 it	 in	 turns	 to	 look</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p267"></a>through	the	binoculars.	By	the	time	they	got	there,	one	of	the	younger	guys	had got	the	rifle	out	and	was	looking	down	the	telescopic	sight,	trying	to	make	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 shapes	 in	 the	 distance.	 Behind	 them	 they	 could	 hear	 Jack	 hobbling	 slowly across	 the	 courtyard	 shouting	 at	 the	 assembled	 crowd	 on	 the	 ramparts,	 looking for	 answers,	 but	 being	 ignored.	 Zed	 took	 the	 stairs	 two	 at	 a	 time,	 Riley	 right behind	 him.	 He	 grabbed	 the	 binoculars	 and	 took	 a	 moment	 to	 locate	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">approaching	figures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 can	 take	 them	 as	 soon	 as	 they’re	 in	 range,”	 said	 the	 kid	 with	 the	 rifle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	one	first?	The	guy	or	the	girl?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	shoot,	you	idiot.	That’s	one	of	ours.	The	girl	I	don’t	recognise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	I	shoot	her	then?”	asked	the	boy	mischievously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	 Give	 me	 that	 rifle	 before	 you	 injure	 yourself,”	 said	 Zed,	 snatching	 the gun	and	cuffing	the	lad	on	the	back	of	his	head. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
Zed	and	Riley	ran	around	to	the	front	entrance	and	out	onto	the	shingle,	meeting<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">the	 two	 new	 arrivals	 as	 they	 reached	 the	 castle	 complex.	 The	 heavy-set	 man wore	 a	 hoodie	 whose	 front	 was	 stained	 with	 dried	 blood,	 his	 face	 covered.	 His jeans	were	filthy	and	shredded	in	places.	There	was	something	familiar	about	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">gait,	supported	by	a	young	girl	who	Riley	seemed	to	half	remember.	She	nodded</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	Riley’s	direction,	a	sheepish	smile	spreading	across	her	gentle	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Top	 of	 the	 morning	 to	 you,	 Zed.	 Riley,	 how	 are	 you?”	 said	 the	 man,	 in	 a croaky	voice,	parched	and	hoarse.	His	face	was	badly	bruised,	his	nose	broken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe?	I	thought	it	might	be	you.”	Zed	grinned.	“Not	looking	your	best,	buddy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where	the	hell	have	you	been?	We	thought	you	were	dead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 think	 I	 was,	 briefly.	 They	 had	 me	 locked	 up	 in	 a	 cellar	 for	 a	 few	 days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nasty	 bunch.	 I	 took	 care	 of	 one	 of	 them	 and	 managed	 to	 get	 Jean	 here	 out.	 I rescued	her,	or	rather,	she	rescued	me	and	then	I	rescued	her	right	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	how	did	you	get	away?”	said	Riley,	puzzled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	underestimated	the	fat	man,	what	can	I	say?”	He	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Big	mistake.	Big	mistake.”	Zed	laughed,	slapping	him	on	the	shoulder	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">welcoming	him	home.	“Let’s	get	you	inside	and	cleaned	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks	for	the	welcome	committee.	And	for	not	letting	those	kids	up	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoot	 at	 us,”	 he	 said,	 waving	 at	 one	 of	 the	 kids	 above	 them	 with	 his	 arms crossed.	“Glad	to	be	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	grabbed	Jean’s	hand.	She	was	waiting	patiently	to	be	properly	introduced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jean?	This	here’s	Riley.	She’s	a	friend	of	Stella’s.	She’ll	look	after	you,	get	you a	bed	for	the	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p268"></a>Riley	 warmly	 shook	 her	 hand	 and	 looked	 her	 up	 and	 down.	 “Any	 friend	 of Stella’s	is	a	friend	of	mine.	Come	on,	you’re	going	to	like	it	here.	There’s	a	few</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	men	than	you’re	used	to,	but	you’ll	get	used	to	that	eventually.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jean	glanced	at	Zed	as	if	uncomfortable	in	his	presence	until	Joe	put	his	arm</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	her	shoulder,	escorting	her	the	last	few	yards	to	the	main	entrance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome	home.	Welcome	to	Hurst,”	said	Riley	with	a	wry	smile.	“You'll	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">safe	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zed	 watched	 them	 leave,	 taking	 a	 moment	 to	 shelter	 from	 the	 wind	 in	 the shadow	 of	 the	 castle	 wall	 that	 towered	 above	 him.	 He	 peered	 up	 into	 the darkening	 skies,	 pondering	 Riley’s	 choice	 of	 words,	 wondering	 whether	 they would	ever	be	safe	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fortress’s	thirty-feet-high	walls	would	never	stop	people	like	Briggs,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	was	as	good	a	place	as	anywhere	to	make	their	stand.	Perhaps	King	was	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	island	was	their	best	hope	now.	They	were	isolated	and	vulnerable	at	Hurst, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	at	least	they	had	each	other.	They	were	stronger	together,	he	was	sure	of	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">now.	Zed	shrugged	and	hurried	after	the	others	as	the	first	drops	of	rain	began	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">fall	all	around	them.	It	would	soon	be	dark	again. </p><p class="calibre1">

<p class="calibre1">The	 early	 winter	 storms	 had	 been	 raging	 for	 days.	 The	 noise	 was	 deafening.	 It wasn’t	just	the	howling	wind;	it	was	also	the	giant	rollers	sweeping	in	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">English	Channel	from	the	South	West.	Surging	past	the	Needles	and	the	western</p>
<p class="calibre1">tip	of	the	island,	the	waves	were	sent	crashing	against	the	weathered	groynes	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">battered	sea	defences	at	the	base	of	the	castle	walls.	Spray	flew	high	into	the	air before	being	carried	away	by	powerful	gusts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hurst	 Castle	 had	 seen	 storms	 worse	 than	 this.	 Every	 winter	 for	 nearly	 five hundred	 years,	 Mother	 Nature	 threw	 her	 worst	 at	 the	 man-made	 structure.	 The castle	 squatted	 resolutely	 on	 this	 most	 remote	 and	 desolate	 location,	 at	 the	 far end	 of	 a	 shingle	 spit	 that	 connected	 the	 fortress	 to	 the	 mainland	 and,	 like	 an unwanted	guest,	nature	made	her	resentment	known	on	a	regular	basis.	Little	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	 the	 raised	 causeway	 that	 ran	 along	 the	 top	 of	 the	 shingle	 defences	 was being	slowly	washed	away.	It	was	only	a	matter	of	time	before	the	castle	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	completely	cut	off	from	the	mainland,	reachable	by	boat	across	narrow	tidal</p>
<p class="calibre1">channels	that	ran	between	the	salt	marshes	around	Keyhaven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 slammed	 shut	 the	 wooden	 door	 to	 the	 lighthouse	 that	 he	 had	 made	 his home	over	the	long	months	since	arriving	here.	It	needed	another	lick	of	paint, </p>
<p class="calibre1">its	surface	blistered	and	peeling.	Buffeted	by	another	gust,	he	wrapped	his	coat</p>
<p class="calibre1">tighter	around	his	trunk,	shielding	his	face	against	the	sheeting	rain.	He	hurried</p>
<p class="calibre1">towards	the	shelter	of	the	castle	wall,	relaxing	a	little	as	the	wind	dropped	and	he could	 hear	 himself	 think	 again.	 The	 drawbridge	 was	 already	 down	 and	 the	 two guards	who	were	taking	shelter	in	the	covered	entrance	straightened	a	little	upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeing	Hurst’s	leader	striding	towards	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Morning,	lads.	Anything	to	report?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	really,”	said	Tommy,	rubbing	his	cheek,	trying	to	remember	anything	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">note	 from	 his	 shift.	 He	 glanced	 jealously	 at	 Scottie	 who	 had	 just	 appeared, cupping	a	hot	brew.	“Other	than	a	couple	of	false	alarms	around	midnight,	we’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">mostly	been	chasing	shadows	as	usual.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	manage	to	get	some	sleep,	Jack?”	asked	Scottie,	blowing	the	steam</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	his	coffee.	“Stormy	night,	eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me?	 Oh,	 I	 slept	 like	 a	 log,	 thank	 you.”	 Jack	 laughed.	 “But	 I’m	 used	 to	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Remember,	I	spent	half	of	my	life	at	sea.	Bit	of	wind	and	rain	never	hurt	anyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p271"></a>Did	the	patrols	find	anything?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	nothing	out	of	the	ordinary.”	Scottie	shrugged.	“We	got	the	call	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Chester</i>	 that	 there	 were	 a	 couple	 of	 radar	 blips	 heading	 out	 of	 Lymington harbour,	but	by	the	time	we	got	a	team	out	there,	they	were	either	turned	round</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	had	vanished	into	the	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sergeant	 Flynn	 said	 they	 were	 probably	 in	 a	 dinghy	 or	 rowing	 boat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Virtually	impossible	to	pick	up	on	radar,”	added	Tommy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Same	 pattern	 we’ve	 seen	 for	 weeks.	 People	 trying	 to	 make	 the	 crossing	 to the	island	in	the	dead	of	night.	Not	much	we	can	do	about	it,”	lamented	Scottie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 nodded,	 scratching	 his	 beard.	 It	 needed	 a	 trim.	 He	 normally	 relied	 on Terra	for	haircuts,	but	she	still	hadn’t	returned	from	the	island.	He	hadn’t	given</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	hope	she	was	still	alive.	It	was	common	knowledge	that	she	was	being	held</p>
<p class="calibre1">captive	 by	 the	 former	 inmates	 of	 Parkhurst	 Prison	 and	 their	 leader,	 Briggs.	 He thought	 back	 fondly	 to	 the	 times	 she	 had	 grabbed	 hold	 of	 his	 head	 and	 started chopping	away	at	his	locks	with	a	blunt	pair	of	scissors,	despite	his	protestations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	shearing	a	sheep,	she	had	said.	He	smiled	at	the	memory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Makes	 you	 wonder	 how	 many	 are	 getting	 through	 the	 net,”	 reflected</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	sniffed	at	the	wind.	There	was	something	foul	in	the	air	this	morning.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned	his	back	against	a	forceful	gust	as	the	three	of	them	moved	back	within</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	shelter	of	the	entrance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Solent	was	now	under	the	watchful	protection	of	the	allies.	For	the	first</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	 since	 the	 outbreak	 of	 the	 Millennial	 Virus,	 order	 was	 slowly	 returning	 to this	 coastal	 region.	 Its	 many	 waterways,	 creeks	 and	 harbours	 were	 scrutinised day	 and	 night	 by	 a	 radar	 operator	 sat	 in	 near	 permanent	 darkness,	 staring	 at	 a screen	on	board	the	 <i class="calibre4">USS	Chester</i>.	Anchored	in	the	Solent,	the	American	missile destroyer	 worked	 hand	 in	 hand	 with	 the	 Royal	 Navy’s	 growing	 fleet	 of	 patrol boats	and	fast	launches,	co-ordinating	the	defence	of	the	island.	Hurst	Castle	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">again	a	critical	outpost	defending	the	western	approaches.	Built	by	Henry	VIII	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">part	 of	 a	 chain	 of	 forts	 and	 castles	 along	 England’s	 southern	 coast	 to	 guard against	 attacks	 by	 the	 French	 and	 Spanish	 navies,	 today	 Hurst	 had	 resumed	 its military	role.	Like	a	passive	sentinel,	Hurst	remained	alert,	day	and	night,	ready</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	do	its	duty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus	 far,	 there	 had	 been	 little	 to	 do.	 Chasing	 shadows	 in	 the	 night,	 seeing ghosts	and	echoes.	Urgent	radio	calls	from	command	would	request	they	check</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	 an	 unauthorised	 vessel	 attempting	 to	 make	 the	 crossing	 under	 cover	 of darkness.	 They	 had	 a	 powerful	 searchlight	 set	 up	 on	 top	 of	 the	 lighthouse,	 but with	 limited	 fuel	 for	 the	 generator,	 they	 rarely	 had	 it	 running.	 They	 relied	 on handheld	 lanterns	 and	 high-powered	 Maglites	 to	 scan	 the	 darkness	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p272"></a>shoreline	or	from	a	R.I.B	scrambled	to	intercept. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 need	 more	 men,”	 said	 Scottie.	 “It’s	 a	 huge	 stretch	 of	 coast	 to	 monitor with	such	a	small	force.	We	need	more	boats	on	patrol,	24/7.	It’s	like	trying	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">find	a	needle	in	a	haystack.	As	things	stand,	we’ve	got	no	chance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	it’s	not	like	we’re	the	only	line	of	defence,”	corrected	Jack.	“Even	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	run	the	gauntlet	and	make	it	to	the	island,	all	the	beaches	are	defended	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">barbed	wire,	obstacles	and	armed	guards.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	 turning	 that	 place	 into	 a	 fortress.	 Next	 thing	 they’ll	 build	 a	 wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	what?”	asked	Tommy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	that’s	what	it	takes	to	keep	the	island	virus-free	and	control	the	population</p>
<p class="calibre1">flow	through	the	quarantine	zones,	then	so	be	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	attacks	had	started	several	weeks	ago.	Most	came	in	the	dead	of	night.	At</p>
<p class="calibre1">first,	they	were	disorganised,	sporadic	incursions,	initially	dismissed	as	desperate people	 trying	 to	 reach	 the	 sanctuary	 offered	 by	 the	 newly	 formed	 Camp	 Wight on	the	island.	More	recent	attempts	suggested	a	systematic	probing	of	the	allies’</p>
<p class="calibre1">defences.	 To	 what	 end,	 Jack	 had	 no	 idea.	 Forces	 unknown	 were	 orchestrating events,	keeping	the	defenders	chasing	shadows,	scrambling	interceptors	only	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">find	the	small	vessels	they	were	sent	to	find	had	disappeared	or	were	returning	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">safe	harbour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 came	 the	 sound	 of	 footsteps	 echoing	 around	 the	 battlements	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone	 raced	 across	 the	 courtyard	 towards	 the	 guardhouse.	 The	 three	 men</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned	to	see	Sam	trying	to	catch	his	breath,	one	hand	on	the	stone	wall	nearest</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	up,	Sam?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Chester</i>	 on	 the	 radio,	 Jack.	 Command	 wants	 us	 to	 take	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i> and	check	something	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Surely	not	in	this	weather?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably	another	false	alarm,”	suggested	Tommy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	 wouldn’t	 ask	 unless	 it	 was	 urgent,	 Jack.	 Apparently	 there’s	 a	 ship about	 five	 and	 a	 half	 miles	 south-east	 of	 Portland	 Bill	 heading	 this	 way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Command	said	that,	from	the	size	of	it,	it’s	probably	a	coastal	steamer	or	small</p>
<p class="calibre1">tanker.	 They	 need	 us	 to	 intercept,	 make	 contact	 and	 find	 out	 their	 intentions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’re	to	take	Sergeant	Flynn	and	a	squad	of	marines,	just	in	case.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can’t	they	send	the	helicopter?”	asked	Tommy.	“It	would	be	much	quicker.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	in	this.”	Sam	gestured	skywards.	“The	winds	are	gusting	storm	force.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 looked	 back	 outside	 and	 squinted	 at	 the	 rain	 clouds.	 The	 storm	 was strengthening.	It	would	be	lunacy	to	take	the	 <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>	out.	She	was	a	thirty-five-foot	coastal	fishing	boat,	broad	in	the	beam	and	more	than	capable	of	operating</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 all	 conditions.	 Nevertheless,	 Jack	 was	 experienced	 enough	 to	 know	 that	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p273"></a>good	skipper	never	underestimated	a	storm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	assuming	they	don’t	have	any	other	patrols	in	the	area	that	could	check</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Apparently	everything	is	returned	to	port	on	account	of	the	weather.	We’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	nearest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	 Sam.	 Can	 you	 let	 Sergeant	 Flynn	 know,	 grab	 the	 oilskins	 and	 safety gear	and	get	her	ready?	We’ll	call	the	 <i class="calibre4">Chester</i>	for	an	update	when	we’re	on	the way.	I	don’t	want	to	go	out	in	this	unless	we	have	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 grabbed	 two	 sets	 of	 oilskins	 from	 the	 coat	 rack	 in	 the	 guardhouse	 and hurried	down	to	the	lighthouse	to	find	his	rucksack.	He	hastily	repacked	the	bag</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 binoculars	 and	 a	 revolver	 before	 joining	 Sam	 at	 the	 jetty	 a	 few	 minutes later,	where	the	 <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>	was	sheltering	from	the	storm.	The	engines	were	already spluttering	noisily	and	the	mooring	lines	were	being	held	on	a	slip.	As	soon	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Flynn	and	the	three	other	men	and	their	packs	and	weapons	were	on	board,	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">cast	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	approaching	high	tide	and	together	with	a	storm	surge,	they	had	plenty</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	water	to	get	out	through	the	mudflats	and	shallows	to	reach	the	main	channel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	they	rounded	the	spit	and	turned	west	into	the	teeth	of	the	gale,	they	met	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">full	force	of	the	wind	and	waves	sweeping	towards	them.	The	Needles	channel</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	narrow	where	water	funnelled	over	rocks	creating	an	overfall.	Coupled	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	eastwards	flowing	tide	and	a	westerly	wind,	it	made	the	half-mile	out	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">deeper	water	of	Christchurch	Bay	bumpier	than	usual.	In	front	of	them,	further</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	to	sea,	lay	a	maelstrom	of	wild,	heaving	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	came	back	inside	the	small	cabin	and	braced	himself	against	the	next	set</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 rollers	 surging	 towards	 them.	 The	 waves	 were	 building	 in	 size	 and	 power, towering	 over	 the	 small	 fishing	 boat.	 The	 four	 marines	 were	 below	 decks</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking	decidedly	green	around	the	gills.	One	man	was	retching	into	a	bucket	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	clinging	on	to,	both	arms	wrapped	around	it	like	his	life	depended	on	it.	Up</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	steps	to	the	wheelhouse,	the	wiper	blades	on	the	windscreen	were	fighting	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">losing	battle	to	clear	the	spray	as	it	swept	in	on	the	wind.	Looking	behind	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">towards	Hurst	Castle,	the	sea	had	become	a	roiling	mass	of	white	horses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	kept	both	hands	on	the	wheel,	working	hard	to	keep	the	 <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>’s	bow	in to	 the	 wind	 and	 waves.	 Their	 engine	 was	 straining	 to	 make	 headway	 and	 he estimated	their	forward	progress	no	better	than	two	or	three	knots.	He	picked	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 radio	 again	 and	 tried	 to	 contact	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Chester</i>.	 The	 first	 attempt	 had	 proven unsuccessful,	their	transmission	lost	between	waves	more	than	twenty	feet	high. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 had	 been	 told	 to	 steam	 south-west	 and	 meet	 what	 was	 likely	 to	 be	 a steamer	 or	 small	 tanker	 making	 for	 the	 Solent,	 now	 some	 three	 miles	 beyond Portland	 Bill.	 The	 vessel	 was	 unresponsive	 to	 all	 attempts	 to	 contact	 it	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p274"></a>moving	very	slowly.	Jack	reckoned	that	they	should	be	no	more	than	a	mile	or two	away	from	it.	Right	now,	visibility	was	so	poor	they	could	pass	within	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">hundred	yards	and	not	see	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 radio	 crackled	 into	 life	 and	 they	 heard	 an	 American	 voice,	 faint	 but intelligible.	Jack	snatched	the	receiver	from	its	cradle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>	 here,  <i class="calibre4">Chester</i>.	 Receiving	 you	 loud	 and	 clear.	 We’re	 entering	 the sector.	No	contact	to	report.	Can	you	confirm	bearing	to	intercept?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 right	 on	 top	 of	 it.	 Should	 be	 dead	 ahead	 of	 you	 now.	 Less	 than	 a mile.	Just	off	your	port	bow,”	said	the	radar	operator. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Copy	that,”	said	Jack.	“Right,	stay	alert,	keep	your	eyes	peeled.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	 grabbed	 the	 binoculars	 and	 started	 scanning	 the	 horizon,	 adjusting	 his stance	to	compensate	for	the	yaw	and	pitch	of	the	boat.	Each	time	the	bow	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Nipper</i>	 collided	 with	 a	 wave,	 the	 forward	 momentum	 seemed	 to	 slow	 as	 the propeller	fought	hard	to	drive	them	forward	again.	Jack	was	worried	the	engine</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 overheat	 and	 they	 would	 be	 left	 without	 power	 to	 drift	 onto	 the	 rocks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	 seen	 it	 happen	 before.	 A	 powerboat	 washed	 up	 on	 the	 shingle	 beach	 at Milford,	 holed	 and	 broken.	 He	 sincerely	 hoped	 that	 this	 wasn’t	 another	 wild goose	chase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sam	 nudged	 him	 in	 the	 ribs	 and	 pointed	 to	 an	 enormous	 shape	 that	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared	 from	 nowhere	 off	 the	 port	 bow.	 It	 took	 Jack	 a	 few	 seconds	 to	 make sense	of	what	he	was	looking	at. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ship	was	a	tanker	in	some	distress.	It	sat	broadside	to	the	waves,	heavy	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	bow	and	listing	a	little	to	starboard.	It	had	taken	on	a	lot	of	water	and	seemed to	be	without	power,	drifting	along	the	coast	towards	the	island. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	circled	to	the	ship’s	stern	and	scanned	the	bridge,	walkways	and	railings</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying	 to	 spot	 any	 crewmembers,	 any	 signs	 of	 life.	 Across	 the	 ship’s	 stern	 was written	  <i class="calibre4">Santana</i>	 and	 its	 registered	 home	 port	 of	 Panama	 underneath.	 Sergeant Flynn	joined	them	in	the	wheelhouse.	As	they	nudged	closer,	Jack	handed	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	binoculars	for	Flynn	to	take	a	closer	look.	A	huge	wave	swept	over	the	bow</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	 <i class="calibre4">Santana</i>	and	the	whole	ship	seemed	to	lurch	towards	them.	Jack	rammed the	engines	in	reverse	and	withdrew	another	fifty	yards,	suddenly	concerned	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	whole	ship	could	roll	on	its	side	if	it	was	hit	again	with	similar	force. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Better	call	it	in,”	said	Flynn.	“Let’s	find	out	what	they	want	us	to	do.” </p>
