    The beauty of a digital mobile phone, as opposed to the analogue
mobile phones still used by some people in Australia, is that a
conversation is reasonably secure from eavesdroppers. If I call you on
my digital mobile, our conversation will be encrypted with the A5
encryption algorithm between the mobile phone and the exchange. The
carrier has copies of the Kis and, in some countries, the government
can access these copies. They are, however, closely guarded secrets.</p>

<p id="id03294" class="calibre1">SKiMo had access to the database of the encrypted Kis and access to
some of the unencrypted Kis themselves. At the time, he never went to
the trouble of gathering enough information about the A3 and A8
algorithms to decrypt the full database, though it would have been
easy to do so. However, he has now obtained that information.</p>

<p id="id03295" class="calibre1">To SKiMo, access to the keys generated for each of thousands of German
mobile phone conversations was simply a curiosity—and a trophy. He
didn't have the expensive equipment required to eavesdrop. To an
intelligence agency, however, access could be very valuable,
particularly if some of those phones belonged to people such as
politicians. Even more valuable would be ongoing access to the OMC, or
better still, the MSC. SkiMo said he would not provide this to any
intelligence agency.</p>

<p id="id03296" class="calibre1">While inside DeTeMobil, SKiMo also learned how to interpret some of
the mapping and signal-strength data. The result? If one of the
company's customers has his mobile turned on, SKiMo says he can
pinpoint the customer's geographic location to within one kilometre.
The customer doesn't even have to be talking on the mobile. All he has
to do is have the phone turned on, waiting to receive calls.</p>

<p id="id03297" class="calibre1">SKiMo tracked one customer for an afternoon, as the man travelled
across Germany, then called the customer up. It turned out they spoke
the same European language.</p>

<p id="id03298" class="calibre1">`Why are you driving from Hamburg to Bremen with your phone on
stand-by mode?' SKiMo asked.</p>

<p id="id03299" class="calibre1">The customer freaked out. How did this stranger at the end of the
phone know where he had been travelling?</p>

<p id="id03300" class="calibre1">SKiMo said he was from Greenpeace. `Don't drive around so much. It
creates pollution,' he told the bewildered mobile customer. Then he
told the customer about the importance of conserving energy and how
prolonged used of mobile phones affected certain parts of one's brain.</p>

<p id="id03301" class="calibre1">Originally, SKiMo broke into the mobile phone carriers' network
because he wanted `to go completely cellular'—a transition which he
hoped would make him both mobile and much harder to trace. Being able
to eavesdrop on other people's calls— including those of the
police—was going to be a bonus.</p>

<p id="id03302" class="calibre1">However, as he pursued this project, he discovered that the code from
a mobile phone manufacturer which he needed to study was `a
multi-lingual project'. `I don't know whether you have ever seen a
multi-lingual project,' SKiMo says, `where nobody defines a common
language that all programmers must use for their comments and function
names? They look horrible. They are no fun to read.' Part of this one
was in Finnish.</p>

<p id="id03303" class="calibre1">SKiMo says he has hacked a number of major vendors and, in several
cases, has had access to their products' source codes.</p>

<p id="id03304" class="calibre1">Has he had the access to install backdoors in primary source code for
major vendors? Yes. Has he done it? He says no. On other hand, I asked
him who he would tell if he did do it. `No-one,' he said, `because
there is more risk if two people know than if one does.'</p>

<p id="id03305" class="calibre1">SKiMo is mostly a loner these days. He shares a limited amount of
information about hacking exploits with two people, but the
conversations are usually carefully worded or vague. He substitutes a
different vendor's names for the real one, or he discusses technical
computer security issues in an in-depth but theoretical manner, so he
doesn't have to name any particular system.</p>

<p id="id03306" class="calibre1">He doesn't talk about anything to do with hacking on the telephone.
Mostly, when he manages to capture a particularly juicy prize, he
keeps news of his latest conquest to himself.</p>

<p id="id03307" class="calibre1">It wasn't always that way. `When I started hacking and phreaking, I
had the need to learn very much and to establish contacts which I
could ask for certain things—such as technical advice,' SKiMo said.
`Now I find it much easier to get that info myself than asking anyone
for it. I look at the source code, then experiment and discover new
bugs myself.'</p>

<p id="id03308" class="calibre1">Asked if the ever-increasing complexity of computer technology hasn't
forced hackers to work in groups of specialists instead of going solo,
he said in some cases yes, but in most cases, no. `That is only true
for people who don't want to learn everything.'</p>

<p id="id03309" class="calibre1">SKiMo can't see himself giving up hacking any time in the near future.</p>

<p id="id03310" class="calibre1">Who is on the other side these days?</p>

<p id="id03311" class="calibre1">In Australia, it is still the Australian Federal Police, although the
agency has come a long way since the early days of the Computer Crimes
Unit. When AFP officers burst in on Phoenix, Nom and Electron, they
were like the Keystone Cops. The police were no match for the
Australian hackers in the subsequent interviews. The hackers were so
far out in front in technical knowledge it was laughable.</p>

<p id="id03312" class="calibre1">The AFP has been closing that gap with considerable alacrity. Under
the guidance of officers like Ken Day, they now run a more technically
skilled group of law enforcement officers. In 1995-96, the AFP had
about 2800 employees, although some 800 of these worked in `community
policing'—serving as the local police in places like the ACT and
Norfolk Island. The AFP's annual expenditure was about $270 million in
that year.</p>

<p id="id03313" class="calibre1">As an institution, the AFP has recently gone through a major
reorganisation, designed to make it less of a command-and-control
military structure and more of an innovative, service oriented
organisation.</p>

<p id="id03314" class="calibre1">Some of these changes are cosmetic. AFP officers are now no longer
called `constable' or `detective sergeant'—they are all just `federal
agents'. The AFP now has a `vision' which is `to fight crime and
win'.3 Its organisational chart had been transformed from a
traditional, hierarchical pyramid of square boxes into a collection of
little circles linked to bigger circles—all in a circle shape. No
phallo-centric structures here. You can tell the politically correct
management consultants have been visiting the AFP.</p>

<p id="id03315" class="calibre1">The AFP has, however, also changed in more substantive ways. There are
now `teams' with different expertise, and AFP investigators can draw
on them on an as-needed basis. In terms of increased efficiency, this
fluidity is probably a good thing.</p>

<p id="id03316" class="calibre1">There are about five permanent officers in the Melbourne computer
crimes area. Although the AFP doesn't release detailed budget
breakdowns, my back-of-the-envelope analysis suggested that the AFP
spends less than $1 million per year on the Melbourne computer crimes
area in total. Sydney also has a Computer Crimes Unit.</p>

<p id="id03317" class="calibre1">Catching hackers and phreakers is only one part of the unit's job.
Another important task is to provide technical computer expertise for
other investigations.</p>

<p id="id03318" class="calibre1">Day still runs the show in Melbourne. He doesn't think or act like a
street cop. He is a psychological player, and therefore well suited to
his opponents. According to a reliable source outside the underground,
he is also a clean cop, a competent officer, and `a nice guy'.</p>

<p id="id03319" class="calibre1">However, being the head of the Computer Crimes Unit for so many years
makes Day an easy target in the underground. In particular, hackers
often make fun of how seriously he seems to take both himself and his
job. When Day appeared on the former ABC show `Attitude', sternly
warning the audience off hacking, he told the viewers, `It's not a
game. It's a criminal act'.</p>

<p id="id03320" class="calibre1">To hackers watching the show, this was a matter of opinion. Not long
after the episode went to air, a few members of Neuro-cactus, an
Australian group of hackers and phreakers which had its roots in
Western Australia, decided to take the mickey out of Day. Two members,
Pick and Minnow, clipped Day's now famous soundbite. Before long, Day
appeared to be saying, `It's not a criminal act. It's a game'—to the
musical theme of `The Bill'. The Neuro-cactus crowd quickly spread
their lampoon across the underground via an illicit VMB connected to
its own toll-free 008 number.</p>

<p id="id03321" class="calibre1">Although Day does perhaps take himself somewhat seriously, it can't be
much fun for him to deal with this monkey business week in and week
out. More than one hacker has told me with great excitement, `I know
someone who is working on getting Day's home number'. The word is that
a few members of the underground already have the information and have
used it. Some people think it would be hilarious to call up Day at
home and prank him. Frankly, I feel a bit sorry for the guy. You can
bet the folks in traffic operations don't have to put up with this
stuff.</p>

<p id="id03322" class="calibre1">But that doesn't mean I think these pranksters should be locked up
either.</p>

<p id="id03323" class="calibre1">If we, as a society, choose not to lock hackers up, then what should
we do with them?</p>

<p id="id03324" class="calibre1">Perhaps a better question is, do we really need to do anything with
them?</p>

<p id="id03325" class="calibre1">One answer is to simply ignore look-see hacking. Society could decide
that it makes more sense to use valuable police resources to catch
dangerous criminals—forgers, embezzlers, white-collar swindlers,
corporate spies and malicious hackers—than to chase look-see hackers.</p>

<p id="id03326" class="calibre1">The law must still maintain the capacity to punish hard where someone
has strayed into what society deems serious crime. However, almost any
serious crime committed by a hacker could be committed by a non-hacker
and prosecuted under other legislation. Fraud, wilful damage and
dealing in stolen property are crimes regardless of the medium—and
should be punished appropriately.</p>

<p id="id03327" class="calibre1">Does it make sense to view most look-see hackers—and by that I mean
hackers who do not do malicious damage or commit fraud—as criminals?
Probably not. They are primarily just a nuisance and should be treated
as such. This would not be difficult to do. The law-makers could
simply declare look-see hacking to be a minor legal infringement. In
the worst-case scenario, a repeat offender might have to do a little
community service. But such community service needs to be managed
properly. In one Australian case, a corrections officer assigned a
hacker to dig ditches with a convicted rapist and murderer.</p>

<p id="id03328" class="calibre1">Many hackers have never had a job—in part because of the high youth
unemployment in some areas—and so their community service might be
their first `position'. The right community service placement must
involve hackers using their computer skills to give something back to
society, preferably in some sort of autonomous, creative project. A
hacker's enthusiasm, curiosity and willingness to experiment can be
directed toward a positive outcome if managed properly.</p>

<p id="id03329" class="calibre1">In cases where hacking or phreaking has been an addiction, the problem
should be treated, not criminalised. Most importantly, these hackers
should not have convictions recorded against them, particularly if
they're young. As Paul Galbally said to the court at Mendax's
sentencing, `All the accused are intelligent—but their intelligence
outstretched their maturity'.  Chances are, most will be able to
overcome or outgrow their addiction.</p>

<p id="id03330" class="calibre1">In practice, most Australia's judges have been reasonably fair in
their sentencing, certainly compared to judges overseas. None of the
Australian hackers detailed in this work received a prison sentence.
Part of this is due to happenstance, but part is also due to the sound
judgments of people like Judge Lewis and Judge Kimm. It must be very
tempting, sitting on the bench every day, to shoot from the hip
interpreting new laws.</p>

<p id="id03331" class="calibre1">As I sat in court listening to each judge, it quickly became clear
that these judges had done their homework. With psychologist Tim
Watson-Munro on the stand, Judge Lewis rapidly zeroed in on the
subject of `free will'—as applied to addiction—regarding Prime
Suspect. In Trax's case, Judge Kimm asked pointed questions which he
could only have formulated after serious study of the extensive legal
brief. Their well-informed judgments suggested a deeper understanding
both of hacking as a crime, and of the intent of the largely untested
computer crime legislation.</p>

<p id="id03332" class="calibre1">However, a great deal of time and money has been wasted in the pursuit
of look-see hackers, largely because this sort of hacking is treated
as a major crime. Consider the following absurd situation created by
Australia's federal computer criminal legislation.</p>

<p id="id03333" class="calibre1">A spy breaks into a computer at the Liberal Party's headquarters and
reads the party's top-secret election strategy, which he may want to
pass on to the Labor Party. He doesn't insert or delete any data in
the process, or view any commercial information. The penalty under
this legislation? A maximum of six months in prison.</p>

<p id="id03334" class="calibre1">That same spy decides he wants to get rich quick. Using the local
telephone system, he hacks into a bank's computer with the intention
of defrauding the financial institution. He doesn't view any
commercial or personal information, or delete or insert any files. Yet
the information he reviews—about the layout of a bank building, or
how to set off its fire alarm or sprinkler system—proves vital in his
plan to defraud the bank. His penalty: a maximum of two years prison.</p>

<p id="id03335" class="calibre1">Our spy now moves onto bigger and better things. He penetrates a
Department of Defence computer with the intention of obtaining
information about Australia's military strategies and passing it on to
the Malaysians. Again, he doesn't delete or insert any data—he just
reads every sensitive planning document he can find. Under the federal
anti-hacking laws, the maximum penalty he would receive would also be
two years prison.</p>

<p id="id03336" class="calibre1">Meanwhile, a look-see hacker breaks into a university computer without
doing any damage. He doesn't delete any files. He FTPs a public-domain
file from another system and quietly tucks it away in a hidden, unused
corner of the university machine. Maybe he writes a message to someone
else on-line. If caught, the law, as interpreted by the AFP and the
DPP, says he faces up to ten years in prison. The reason? He has
inserted or deleted data.</p>

<p id="id03337" class="calibre1">Although the spy hacker might also face other charges—such as
treason—this exercise illustrates some of the problems with the
current computer crime legislation.</p>

<p id="id03338" class="calibre1">The letter of the law says that our look-see hacker might face a
prison term five times greater than the bank fraud criminal or the
military spy, and twenty times greater than the anti-Liberal Party
subversive, if he inserts or deletes any data. The law, as interpreted
by the AFP, says that the look-see hacking described above should have
the same maximum ten-year prison penalty as judicial corruption. It's
a weird mental image—the corrupt judge and the look-see hacker
sharing a prison cell.</p>

<p id="id03339" class="calibre1">Although the law-makers may not have fully understood the
technological aspects of hacking when they introduced the computer
crimes legislation, their intent seems clear. They were trying to
differentiate between a malicious hacker and a look-see hacker, but
they could have worded it better.</p>

<p id="id03340" class="calibre1">As it's worded, the legislation puts malicious, destructive hacking on
a par with look-see hacking by saying that anyone who destroys,
erases, alters or inserts data via a carrier faces a prison term,
regardless of the person's intent. There is no gradation in the law
between mere deletion of data and `aggravated deletion'—the maximum
penalty is ten years for both. The AFP has taken advantage of this
lack of distinction, and the result has been a steady stream of
look-see hackers being charged with the most serious computer crime
offences.</p>

<p id="id03341" class="calibre1">Parliament makes the laws. Government institutions such as the AFP,
the DPP and the courts interpret and apply those laws. The AFP and to
some extent the DPP have applied the strict letter of the law
correctly in most of the hacking cases described in this book. They
have, however, missed the intention of the law. Change the law and
they may behave differently. Make look-see hacking a minor offence and
the institutions will stop going after the soft targets and hopefully
spend more time on the real criminals.</p>

<p id="id03342" class="calibre1">I have seen some of these hackers up close, studied them for two years
and learned a bit about what makes them tick. In many ways, they are
quintessentially Australian, always questioning authority and
rebelling against `the establishment'. They're smart—in some cases
very smart. A few might even be classified as technical geniuses.
They're mischievous, but also very enterprising. They're rebels,
public nuisances and dreamers.</p>

<p id="id03343" class="calibre1">Most of all, they know how to think outside the box.</p>

<p id="id03344" class="calibre1">This is not a flaw. Often, it is a very valuable trait—and one which
pushes society forward into new frontiers. The question shouldn't be
whether we want to crush it but how we should steer it in a different
direction.</p>

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h5>

<p id="id03681" class="calibre1">To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

<h4 id="id03682" class="calibre11">Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works</h4>

<p id="id03683" class="calibre1">1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>

<p id="id03684" class="calibre1">1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p id="id03685" class="calibre1">1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p id="id03686" class="calibre1">This particular work is one of the few copyrighted individual works
included with the permission of the copyright holder.  Information on
the copyright owner for this particular work and the terms of use
imposed by the copyright holder on this work are set forth at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p id="id03687" class="calibre1">1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.</p>

<p id="id03689" class="calibre1">1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

copied or distributed:</p>

<p id="id03690" class="calibre1">This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

<p id="id03691" class="calibre1">1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.</p>

<p id="id03692" class="calibre1">1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional

Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p id="id03695" class="calibre1">1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm

that</p>

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.</p>

<p id="id03700" class="calibre12">- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

<p id="id03702" class="calibre1">1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<h5 id="id03703" class="calibre9">1.F.</h5>

<p id="id03704" class="calibre1">1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p id="id03705" class="calibre1">1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p id="id03706" class="calibre1">1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p id="id03707" class="calibre1">1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p id="id03708" class="calibre1">1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p id="id03709" class="calibre1">1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h4 id="id03710" class="calibre11">Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h4>

<p id="id03711" class="calibre1">Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p id="id03712" class="calibre1">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
