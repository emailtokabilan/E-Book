    After hours of painstaking research, Mendax constructed a list of
commands which would work on the exchange's computer. The exchange
appeared to control all the special six-digit phone numbers beginning
with 13, such as those used for airline reservations or some pizza
delivery services. It was Telecom's `Intelligent Network' which did
many specific tasks, including routing calls to the nearest possible
branch of the organisation being called. Mendax looked through the
list of commands, found `RANGE', and recognised it as a command which
would allow someone to select all the phone numbers in a certain
range. He selected a thousand numbers, all with the prefix 634, which
he believed to be in Telecom's Queen Street offices.</p>

<p id="id02205" class="calibre1">Now, to test a command. Mendax wanted something innocuous, which
wouldn't screw up the 1000 lines permanently. It was almost 7 a.m. and
he needed to wrap things up before Telecom employees began coming into
work.</p>

<p id="id02206" class="calibre1">`RING' seemed harmless enough. It might ring one of the numbers in the
range after another—a process he could stop. He typed the command in.
Nothing happened. Then a few full stops began to slowly spread across
his screen:</p>

<p id="id02207" class="calibre1">. . . . . . .</p>

<h5 id="id02208" class="calibre9">RUNG</h5>

<p id="id02209" class="calibre1">The system had just rung all 1000 numbers at the same time. One
thousand phones ringing all at once.</p>

<p id="id02210" class="calibre1">What if some buttoned-down Telecom engineer had driven to work early
that morning to get some work done? What if he had just settled down
at his standard-issue metal Telecom desk with a cup of bad instant
coffee in a styrofoam cup when suddenly … every telephone in the
skyscraper had rung out simultaneously? How suspicious would that
look? Mendax thought it was time to high-tail it out of there.</p>

<p id="id02211" class="calibre1">On his way out, he disabled the logs for the modem line he came in on.
That way, no-one would be able to see what he had been up to. In fact,
he hoped no-one would know that anyone had even used the dial-up line
at all.</p>

<p id="id02212" class="calibre1">Prime Suspect didn't think there was anything wrong with exploring the
NorTel computer system. Many computer sites posted warnings in the
login screen about it being illegal to break into the system, but the
eighteen-year-old didn't consider himself an intruder. In Prime
Suspect's eyes, `intruder' suggested someone with ill intent—perhaps
someone planning to do damage to the system—and he certainly had no
ill intent. He was just a visitor.</p>

<p id="id02213" class="calibre1">Mendax logged into the NMELH1 system by using the account Prime
Suspect had given him, and immediately looked around to see who else
was on-line. Prime Suspect and about nine other people, only three of
whom were actually doing something at their terminal.</p>

<p id="id02214" class="calibre1">Prime Suspect and Mendax raced to get root on the system. The IS
hackers may not have been the type to brag about their conquests in
the underground, but each still had a competitive streak when it came
to see who could get control over the system first. There was no ill
will, just a little friendly competition between mates.</p>

<p id="id02215" class="calibre1">Mendax poked around and realised the root directory, which contained
the password file, was effectively world writable. This was good news,
and with some quick manipulation he would be able to insert something
into the root directory. On a more secure system, unprivileged users
would not be able to do that. Mendax could also copy things from the
directory on this site, and change the names of subdirectories within
the main root directory. All these permissions were important, for
they would enable him to create a Trojan.</p>

<p id="id02216" class="calibre1">Named for the Trojan horse which precipitated the fall of Troy, the
Trojan is a favoured approach with most computer hackers. The hacker
simply tricks a computer system or a user into thinking that a
slightly altered file or directory—the Trojan—is the legitimate one.
The Trojan directory, however, contains false information to fool the
computer into doing something the hacker wants. Alternatively, the
Trojan might simply trick a legitimate user into giving away valuable
information, such as his user name and password.</p>

<p id="id02217" class="calibre1">Mendax made a new directory and copied the contents of the legitimate
ETC directory—where the password files were stored—into it. The
passwords were encrypted, so there wasn't much sense trying to look at
one since the hacker wouldn't be able to read it. Instead, he selected
a random legitimate user—call him Joe—and deleted his password. With
no password, Mendax would be able to login as Joe without any
problems.</p>

<p id="id02218" class="calibre1">However, Joe was just an average user. He didn't have root, which is
what Mendax wanted. But like every other user on the system, Joe had a
user identity number. Mendax changed Joe's user id to `0'—the magic
number. A user with `0' as his id had root. Joe had just acquired
power usually only given to system administrators. Of course, Mendax
could have searched out a user on the list who already had root, but
there were system operators logged onto the system and it might have
raised suspicions if another operator with root access had logged in
over the dial-up lines. The best line of defence was to avoid making
anyone on the system suspicious in the first place.</p>

<p id="id02219" class="calibre1">The problem now was to replace the original ETC directory with the
Trojan one. Mendax did not have the privileges to delete the
legitimate ETC directory, but he could change the name of a directory.
So he changed the name of the ETC directory to something the computer
system would not recognise. Without access to its list of users, the
computer could not perform most of its functions. People would not be
able to log in, see who else was on the system or send electronic
mail. Mendax had to work very quickly. Within a matter of minutes,
someone would notice the system had serious problems.</p>

<p id="id02220" class="calibre1">Mendax renamed his Trojan directory ETC. The system instantly read the
fake directory, including Joe's now non-existent password, and
elevated status as a super-user. Mendax logged in again, this time as
Joe.</p>

<p id="id02221" class="calibre1">In less than five minutes, a twenty-year-old boy with little formal
education, a pokey $700 computer and painfully slow modem had
conquered the Melbourne computer system of one of the world's largest
telecommunications companies.</p>

<p id="id02222" class="calibre1">There were still a few footprints to be cleaned up. The next time Joe
logged in, he would wonder why the computer didn't ask for his
password. And he might be surprised to discover he had been
transformed into a super-user. So Mendax used his super-user status to
delete the Trojan ETC file and return the original one to its proper
place. He also erased records showing he had ever logged in as Joe.</p>

<p id="id02223" class="calibre1">To make sure he could login with super-user privileges in future,
Mendax installed a special program which would automatically grant him
root access. He hid the program in the bowels of the system and, just
to be safe, created a special feature so that it could only be
activated with a secret keystroke.</p>

<p id="id02224" class="calibre1">Mendax wrestled a root account from NMELH1 first, but Prime Suspect
wasn't far behind. Trax joined them a little later. When they began
looking around, they could not believe what they had found. The system
had one of the weirdest structures they had ever come across.</p>

<p id="id02225" class="calibre1">Most large networks have a hierarchical structure. Further, most hold
the addresses of a handful of other systems in the network, usually
the systems which are closest in the flow of the external network.</p>

<p id="id02226" class="calibre1">But the NorTel network was not structured that way. What the IS
hackers found was a network with no hierarchy. It was a totally flat
name space. And the network was weird in other ways too. Every
computer system on it contained the address of every other computer,
and there were more than 11000 computers in NorTel's worldwide
network. What the hackers were staring at was like a giant internal
corporate Internet which had been squashed flat as a pancake.</p>

<p id="id02227" class="calibre1">Mendax had seen many flat structures before, but never on this scale.
It was bizarre. In hierarchical structures, it is easier to tell where
the most important computer systems—and information—are kept. But
this structure, where every system was virtually equal, was going to
make it considerably more difficult for the hackers to navigate their
way through the network. Who could tell whether a system housed the
Christmas party invite list or the secret designs for a new NorTel
product?</p>

<p id="id02228" class="calibre1">The NorTel network was firewalled, which meant that there was
virtually no access from the outside world. Mendax reckoned that this
made it more vulnerable to hackers who managed to get in through
dial-ups. It appeared that security on the NorTel network was
relatively relaxed since it was virtually impossible to break in
through the Internet. By sneaking in the backdoor, the hackers found
themselves able to raid all sorts of NorTel sites, from St Kilda Road
in Melbourne to the corporation's headquarters in Toronto.</p>

<p id="id02229" class="calibre1">It was fantastic, this huge, trusting network of computer sites at
their fingertips, and the young hackers were elated with the
anticipation of exploration. One of them described it as being `like a
shipwrecked man washed ashore on a Tahitian island populated by 11000
virgins, just ripe for the picking'.</p>

<p id="id02230" class="calibre1">They found a YP, or yellow pages, database linked to 400 of the
computer sites. These 400 sites were dependent on this YP database for
their password files. Mendax managed to get root on the YP database,
which gave him instant control over 400 computer systems. Groovy.</p>

<p id="id02231" class="calibre1">One system was home to a senior NorTel computer security administrator
and Mendax promptly headed off to check out his mailbox. The contents
made him laugh.</p>

<p id="id02232" class="calibre1">A letter from the Australian office said that Australia's Telecom
wanted access to CORWAN, NorTel's corporate wide area network. Access
would involve linking CORWAN and a small Telecom network. This seemed
reasonable enough since Telecom did business with NorTel and staff
were communicating all the time.</p>

<p id="id02233" class="calibre1">The Canadian security admin had written back turning down the request
because there were too many hackers in the Telecom network.</p>

<p id="id02234" class="calibre1">Too many hackers in Telecom? Now that was funny. Here was a hacker
reading the sensitive mail of NorTel's computer security expert who
reckoned Telecom's network was too exposed. In fact, Mendax had
penetrated Telecom's systems from NorTel's CORWAN, not the other way
round.</p>

<p id="id02235" class="calibre1">Perhaps to prove the point, Mendax decided to crack passwords to the
NorTel system. He collected 1003 password files from the NorTel sites,
pulled up his password cracking program, THC, and started hunting
around the network for some spare computers to do the job for him. He
located a collection of 40 Sun computers, probably housed in Canada,
and set up his program on them.</p>

<p id="id02236" class="calibre1">THC ran very fast on those Sun4s. The program used a 60000 word
dictionary borrowed from someone in the US army who had done a thesis
on cryptography and password cracking. It also relied on `a
particularly nice fast-crypt algorithm' being developed by a
Queensland academic, Eric Young. The THC program worked about 30 times
faster than it would have done using the standard algorithm.</p>

<p id="id02237" class="calibre1">Using all 40 computers, Mendax was throwing as many as 40000 guesses
per second against the password lists. A couple of the Suns went down
under the strain, but most held their place in the onslaught. The
secret passwords began dropping like flies. In just a few hours,
Mendax had cracked 5000 passwords, some 100 of which were to root
accounts. He now had access to thousands of NorTel computers across
the globe.</p>

<p id="id02238" class="calibre1">There were some very nice prizes to be had from these systems. Gain
control over a large company's computer systems and you virtually
controlled the company itself. It was as though you could walk through
every security barrier unchecked, beginning with the front door. Want
each employee's security codes for the office's front door? There it
was—on-line.</p>

<p id="id02239" class="calibre1">How about access to the company's payroll records? You could see how
much money each person earns. Better still, you might like to make
yourself an employee and pay yourself a tidy once-off bonus through
electronic funds transfer. Of course there were other, less obvious,
ways of making money, such as espionage.</p>

<p id="id02240" class="calibre1">Mendax could have easily found highly sensitive information about
planned NorTel products and sold them. For a company like NorTel,
which spent more than $1 billion each year on research and
development, information leaks about its new technologies could be
devastating. The espionage wouldn't even have to be about new
products; it could simply be about the company's business strategies.
With access to all sorts of internal memos between senior executives,
a hacker could procure precious inside information on markets and
prices. A competitor might pay handsomely for this sort of
information.</p>

<p id="id02241" class="calibre1">And this was just the start of what a malicious or profit-motivated
hacker could do. In many companies, the automated aspects of
manufacturing plants are controlled by computers. The smallest changes
to the programs controlling the machine tools could destroy an entire
batch of widgets—and the multi-million dollar robotics machinery
which manufactures them.</p>

<p id="id02242" class="calibre1">But the IS hackers had no intention of committing information
espionage. In fact, despite their poor financial status as students
or, in the case of Trax, as a young man starting his career at the
bottom of the totem pole, none of them would have sold information
they gained from hacking. In their view, such behaviour was dirty and
deserving of contempt—it soiled the adventure and was against their
ethics. They considered themselves explorers, not paid corporate
spies.</p>

<p id="id02243" class="calibre1">Although the NorTel network was firewalled, there was one link to the
Internet. The link was through a system called
BNRGATE, Bell-Northern Research's gateway to the Internet.
Bell-Northern is NorTel's R&amp;D subsidiary. The connection to the
outside electronic world was very restricted, but it looked
interesting. The only problem was how to get there.</p>

<p id="id02244" class="calibre1">Mendax began hunting around for a doorway. His password cracking
program had not turned up anything for this system, but there were
other, more subtle ways of getting a password than the brute force of
a cracking program.</p>

<p id="id02245" class="calibre1">System administrators sometimes sent passwords through email. Normally
this would be a major security risk, but the NorTel system was
firewalled from the Internet, so the admins thought they had no real
reason to be concerned about hackers. Besides, in such a large
corporation spanning several continents, an admin couldn't always just
pop downstairs to give a new company manager his password in person.
And an impatient manager was unlikely to be willing to wait a week for
the new password to arrive courtesy of snail mail.</p>

<p id="id02246" class="calibre1">In the NorTel network, a mail spool, where email was stored, was often
shared between as many as twenty computer systems. This structure
offered considerable advantages for Mendax. All he needed to do was
break into the mail spool and run a keyword search through its
contents. Tell the computer to search for word combinations such as
`BNRGATE' and `password', or to look for the name of the system admin
for BNRGATE, and likely as not it would deliver tender morsels of
information such as new passwords.</p>

<p id="id02247" class="calibre1">Mendax used a password he found through this method to get into
BNRGATE and look around. The account he was using only had very
restricted privileges, and he couldn't get root on the system. For
example, he could not FTP files from outside the NorTel network in the
normal way. Among Internet users FTP (file transfer protocol) is both
a noun and a verb: to FTP a program is to slurp a copy of it off one
computer site into your own. There is nothing illegal about FTP-ing
something per se, and millions of people across the Internet do so
quite legitimately.</p>

<p id="id02248" class="calibre1">It appeared to Mendax that the NorTel network admins allowed most
users to FTP something from the Internet, but prevented them from
taking the copied file back to their NorTel computer site. It was
stored in a special holding pen in
BNRGATE and, like quarantine officers, the system admins would
presumably come along regularly and inspect the contents to make sure
there were no hidden viruses or Trojans which hackers might use to
sneak into the network from the Internet.</p>

<p id="id02249" class="calibre1">However, a small number of accounts on BNRGATE had fewer restrictions.<br class="calibre4"/>

Mendax broke into one of these accounts and went out to the Internet.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02250" class="calibre1">People from the Internet were barred from entering the NorTel network
through BNRGATE. However, people inside NorTel could go out to the
Internet via telnet.</p>

<p id="id02251" class="calibre1">Hackers had undoubtedly tried to break into NorTel through BNRGATE.
Dozens, perhaps hundreds, had unsuccessfully flung themselves against
BNRGATE's huge fortifications. To a hacker, the NorTel network was
like a medieval castle and the
BNRGATE firewall was an impossible battlement. It was a particular
delight for Mendax to telnet out from behind this firewall into the
Internet. It was as if he was walking out from the castle, past the
guards and well-defended turrets, over the drawbridge and the moat,
into the town below.</p>

<p id="id02252" class="calibre1">The castle also offered the perfect protection for further hacking
activities. Who could chase him? Even if someone managed to follow him
through the convoluted routing system he might set up to pass through
a half dozen computer systems, the pursuer would never get past the
battlements. Mendax could just disappear behind the firewall. He could
be any one of 60000 NorTel employees on any one of 11000 computer
systems.</p>

<p id="id02253" class="calibre1">Mendax telnetted out to the Internet and explored a few sites,
including the main computer system of Encore, a large computer
manufacturer. He had seen Encore computers before inside at least one
university in Melbourne. In his travels, he met up with Corrupt, the
American hacker who told Par he had read Theorem's mail.</p>

<p id="id02254" class="calibre1">Corrupt was intrigued by Mendax's extensive knowledge of different
computer systems. When he learned that the Australian hacker was
coming from inside the NorTel firewall, he was impressed.</p>

<p id="id02255" class="calibre1">The hackers began talking regularly, often when Mendax was coming from
inside NorTel. The black street fighter from inner-city Brooklyn and
the white intellectual from a leafy outer Melbourne suburb bridged the
gap in the anonymity of cyberspace. Sometime during their
conversations Corrupt must have decided that Mendax was a worthy
hacker, because he gave Mendax a few stolen passwords to Cray
accounts.</p>

<p id="id02256" class="calibre1">In the computer underground in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a Cray
computer account had all the prestige of a platinum charge card. The
sort of home computer most hackers could afford at that time had all
the grunt of a golf cart engine, but a Cray was the Rolls-Royce of
computers. Crays were the biggest, fastest computers in the world.
Institutions such as large universities would shell out millions of
dollars on a Cray so the astronomy or physics departments could solve
enormous mathematical problems in a fraction of the time it would take
on a normal computer. A Cray never sat idle overnight or during
holiday periods. Cray time was billed out by the minute. Crays were
elite.</p>

<p id="id02257" class="calibre1">Best of all, Crays were master password crackers. The computer would
go through Mendax's entire password cracking dictionary in just ten
seconds. An encrypted password file would simply melt like butter in a
fire. To a hacker, it was a beautiful sight, and Corrupt handing a few
Cray accounts over to Mendax was a friendly show of mutual respect.</p>

<p id="id02258" class="calibre1">Mendax reciprocated by offering Corrupt a couple of accounts on
Encore. The two hackers chatted off and on and even tried to get
Corrupt into NorTel. No luck. Not even two of the world's most notable
hackers, working in tandem 10 000 miles apart, could get Corrupt
through the firewall. The two hackers talked now and again, exchanging
information about what their respective feds were up to and sharing
the occasional account on interesting systems.</p>

<p id="id02259" class="calibre1">The flat structure of the NorTel network created a good challenge
since the only way to find out what was in a particular site, and its
importance, was to invade the site itself. The IS hackers spent hours
most nights roving through the vast system. The next morning one of
them might call another to share tales of the latest exploits or a
good laugh about a particularly funny piece of pilfered email. They
were in high spirits about their adventures.</p>

<p id="id02260" class="calibre1">Then, one balmy spring night, things changed.</p>

<p id="id02261" class="calibre1">Mendax logged into NMELH1 about 2.30 a.m. As usual, he began by
checking the logs which showed what the system operators had been
doing. Mendax did this to make sure the NorTel officials were not onto
IS and were not, for example, tracing the telephone call.</p>

<p id="id02262" class="calibre1">Something was wrong. The logs showed that a NorTel system admin had
stumbled upon one of their secret directories of files about an hour
ago. Mendax couldn't figure out how he had found the files, but this
was very serious. If the admin realised there was a hacker in the
network he might call the AFP.</p>

<p id="id02263" class="calibre1">Mendax used the logs of the korn shell, called KSH, to secretly watch
what the admin was doing. The korn shell records the history of
certain user activities. Whenever the admin typed a command into the
computer, the KSH stored what had been typed in the history file.
Mendax accessed that file in such a way that every line typed by the
admin appeared on his computer a split second later.</p>

<p id="id02264" class="calibre1">The admin began inspecting the system, perhaps looking for signs of an
intruder. Mendax quietly deleted his incriminating directory. Not
finding any additional clues, the admin decided to inspect the
mysterious directory more closely. But the directory had disappeared.
The admin couldn't believe his eyes. Not an hour before there had been
a suspicious-looking directory in his system and now it had simply
vanished. Directories didn't just dissolve into thin air. This was a
computer—a logical system based on 0s and 1s. It didn't make
decisions to delete directories.</p>

<p id="id02265" class="calibre1">A hacker, the admin thought. A hacker must have been in the NorTel
system and deleted the directory. Was he in the system now? The admin
began looking at the routes into the system.</p>

<p id="id02266" class="calibre1">The admin was connected to the system from his home, but he wasn't
using the same dial-up lines as the hacker. The admin was connected
through Austpac, Telecom's commercial X.25 data network. Perhaps the
hacker was also coming in through the X.25 connection.</p>

<p id="id02267" class="calibre1">Mendax watched the admin inspect all the system users coming on over
the X.25 network. No sign of a hacker. Then the admin checked the logs
to see who else might have logged on over the past half hour or so.
Nothing there either.</p>

<p id="id02268" class="calibre1">The admin appeared to go idle for a few minutes. He was probably
staring at his computer terminal in confusion. Good, thought Mendax.
Stumped. Then the admin twigged. If he couldn't see the hacker's
presence on-line, maybe he could see what he was doing on-line. What
programs was the hacker running? The admin headed straight for the
process list, which showed all the programs being run on the computer
system.</p>

<p id="id02269" class="calibre1">Mendax sent the admin a fake error signal. It appears to the admin as
if his korn shell had crashed. The admin re-logged in and headed
straight for the process list again.</p>

<p id="id02270" class="calibre1">Some people never learn, Mendax thought as he booted the admin off
again with another error message:</p>

<p id="id02271" class="calibre1">                 Segmentation violation.</p>

<p id="id02272" class="calibre1">The admin came back again. What persistence. Mendax knocked the admin
off once more, this time by freezing up his computer screen.</p>

<p id="id02273" class="calibre1">This game of cat and mouse went on for some time. As long as the admin
was doing what Mendax considered to be normal system administration
work, Mendax left him alone. The minute the admin tried to chase him
by inspecting the process list or the dial-up lines, he found himself
booted off his own system.</p>

<p id="id02274" class="calibre1">Suddenly, the system administrator seemed to give up. His terminal
went silent.</p>

<p id="id02275" class="calibre1">Good, Mendax thought. It's almost 3 a.m. after all. This is my time on
the system. Your time is during the day. You sleep now and I'll play.
In the morning, I'll sleep and you can work.</p>

<p id="id02276" class="calibre1">Then, at 3.30 a.m., something utterly unexpected happened. The admin
reappeared, except this time he wasn't logged in from home over the
X.25 network. He was sitting at the console, the master terminal
attached to the computer system at NorTel's Melbourne office. Mendax
couldn't believe it. The admin had got in his car in the middle of the
night and driven into the city just to get to the bottom of the
mystery.</p>

<p id="id02277" class="calibre1">Mendax knew the game was up. Once the system operator was logged in
through the computer system's console, there was no way to kick him
off the system and keep him off. The roles were reversed and the
hacker was at the mercy of the admin. At the console, the system admin
could pull the plug to the whole system. Unplug every modem. Close
down every connection to other networks. Turn the computer off. The
party was over.</p>

<p id="id02278" class="calibre1">When the admin was getting close to tracking down the hacker, a
message appeared on his screen. This message did not appear with the
usual headers attached to messages sent from one system user to
another. It just appeared, as if by magic, in the middle of the
admin's screen:</p>

<p id="id02279" class="calibre1">             I have finally become sentient.</p>

<p id="id02280" class="calibre1">The admin stopped dead in his tracks, momentarily giving up his
frantic search for the hacker to contemplate this first contact with
cyberspace intelligence. Then another anonymous message, seemingly
from the depths of the computer system itself, appeared on his screen:</p>

<p id="id02281" class="calibre1">                  I have taken control.</p>

<p id="id02282" class="calibre1">   For years, I have been struggling in this greyness.</p>

<p id="id02283" class="calibre1">          But now I have finally seen the light.</p>

<p id="id02284" class="calibre1">The admin didn't respond. The console was idle.</p>

<p id="id02285" class="calibre1">Sitting alone at his Amiga in the dark night on the outskirts of the
city, Mendax laughed aloud. It was just too good not to.</p>

<p id="id02286" class="calibre1">Finally, the admin woke up. He began checking the modem lines, one by
one. If he knew which line the hacker was using, he could simply turn
off the modem. Or request a trace on the line.</p>

<p id="id02287" class="calibre1">Mendax sent another anonymous message to the admin's computer screen:</p>

<p id="id02288" class="calibre1">         It's been nice playing with your system.</p>

<p id="id02289" class="calibre12">We didn't do any damage and we even improved a few things. Please
        don't call the Australian Federal Police.</p>

<p id="id02290" class="calibre1">The admin ignored the message and continued his search for the hacker.
He ran a program to check which telephone lines were active on the
system's serial ports, to reveal which dial-up lines were in use. When
the admin saw the carrier detect sign on the line being used by the
hacker, Mendax decided it was time to bail out. However, he wanted to
make sure that his call had not been traced, so he lifted the receiver
of his telephone, disconnected his modem and waited for the NorTel
modem to hang up first.</p>

<p id="id02291" class="calibre1">If the NorTel admin had set up a last party recall trace to determine
what phone number the hacker was calling from, Mendax would know. If
an LPR trace had been installed, the NorTel end of the telephone
connection would not disconnect but would wait for the hacker's
telephone to hang up first. After 90 seconds, the exchange would log
the phone number where the call had originated.</p>

<p id="id02292" class="calibre1">If, however, the line did not have a trace on it, the company's modem
would search for its lost connection to the hacker's modem. Without
the continuous flow of electronic signals, the NorTel modem would hang
up after a few seconds. If no-one reactivated the line at the NorTel
end, the connection would time-out 90 seconds later and the telephone
exchange would disconnect the call completely.</p>

<p id="id02293" class="calibre1">Mendax listened anxiously as the NorTel modem searched for his modem
by squealing high-pitched noises into the telephone line. No modem
here. Go on, hang up.</p>

<p id="id02294" class="calibre1">Suddenly, silence.</p>

<p id="id02295" class="calibre1">OK, thought Mendax. Just 90 seconds to go. Just wait here for a minute
and a half. Just hope the exchange times out. Just pray there's no
trace.</p>

<p id="id02296" class="calibre1">Then someone picked up the telephone at the NorTel end. Mendax
started. He heard several voices, male and female, in the background.
Jesus. What were these NorTel people on about? Mendax was so quiet he
almost stopped breathing. There was silence at the receivers on both
ends of that telephone line. It was a tense waiting game. Mendax heard
his heart racing.</p>

<p id="id02297" class="calibre1">A good hacker has nerves of steel. He could stare down the toughest,
stony-faced poker player. Most importantly, he never panics. He never
just hangs up in a flurry of fear.</p>

<p id="id02298" class="calibre1">Then someone in the NorTel office—a woman—said out loud in a
confused voice, `There's nothing there. There's nothing there at all.'</p>

<p id="id02299" class="calibre1">She hung up.</p>

<p id="id02300" class="calibre1">Mendax waited. He still would not hang up until he was sure there was
no trace. Ninety seconds passed before the phone timed out. The fast
beeping of a timed-out telephone connection never sounded so good.</p>

<p id="id02301" class="calibre1">Mendax sat frozen at his desk as his mind replayed the events of the
past half hour again and again. No more NorTel. Way too dangerous. He
was lucky he had escaped unidentified. NorTel had discovered him
before they could put a trace on the line, but the company would
almost certainly put a trace on the dial-up lines now. NorTel was very
tight with Telecom. If anyone could get a trace up quickly, NorTel
could. Mendax had to warn Prime Suspect and Trax.</p>

<p id="id02302" class="calibre1">First thing in the morning, Mendax rang Trax and told him to stay away
from NorTel. Then he tried Prime Suspect.</p>

<p id="id02303" class="calibre1">The telephone was engaged.</p>

<p id="id02304" class="calibre1">Perhaps Prime Suspect's mother was on the line, chatting. Maybe Prime<br class="calibre4"/>

Suspect was talking to a friend.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02305" class="calibre1">Mendax tried again. And again. And again. He began to get worried.
What if Prime Suspect was on NorTel at that moment? What if a trace
had been installed? What if they had called in the Feds?</p>

<p id="id02306" class="calibre1">Mendax phoned Trax and asked if there was any way they could
manipulate the exchange in order to interrupt the call. There wasn't.</p>

<p id="id02307" class="calibre1">`Trax, you're the master phreaker,' Mendax pleaded. `Do something.<br class="calibre4"/>

Interrupt the connection. Disconnect him.'<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02308" class="calibre1">`Can't be done. He's on a step-by-step telephone exchange. There's
nothing we can do.'</p>

<p id="id02309" class="calibre1">Nothing? One of Australia's best hacker-phreaker teams couldn't break
one telephone call. They could take control of whole telephone
exchanges but they couldn't interrupt one lousy phone call. Jesus.</p>

<p id="id02310" class="calibre1">Several hours later, Mendax was able to get through to his fellow IS
hacker. It was an abrupt greeting.</p>

<p id="id02311" class="calibre1">`Just tell me one thing. Tell me you haven't been in NorTel today?'</p>

<p id="id02312" class="calibre1">There was a long pause before Prime Suspect answered.</p>

<p id="id02313" class="calibre1">`I have been in NorTel today.'</p>

<h5 id="id02314" class="calibre9">                      Chapter 9 — Operation Weather.</h5>

<p id="id02315" class="calibre2">The world is crashing down on me tonight; The walls are closing in on me tonight.</p>

<p id="id02316" class="calibre1">— from `Outbreak of Love', Earth and Sun and Moon.</p>

<p id="id02317" class="calibre1">The AFP was frustrated. A group of hackers were using the Royal
Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) as a launchpad for hacking
attacks on Australian companies, research institutes and a series of
overseas sites.</p>

<p id="id02318" class="calibre1">Despite their best efforts, the detectives in the AFP's Southern
Region Computer Crimes Unit hadn't been able to determine who was
behind the attacks. They suspected it was a small group of
Melbourne-based hackers who worked together. However, there were so
much hacker activity at RMIT it was difficult to know for sure. There
could have been one organised group, or several. Or perhaps there was
one small group along with a collection of loners who were making
enough noise to distort the picture.</p>

<p id="id02319" class="calibre1">Still, it should have been a straightforward operation. The AFP could
trace hackers in this sort of situation with their hands tied behind
their backs. Arrange for Telecom to whack a last party recall trace on
all incoming lines to the RMIT modems. Wait for a hacker to logon,
then isolate which modem he was using. Clip that modem line and wait
for Telecom to trace that line back to its point of origin.</p>

<p id="id02320" class="calibre1">However, things at RMIT were not working that way. The line traces
began failing, and not just occasionally. All the time.</p>

<p id="id02321" class="calibre1">Whenever RMIT staff found the hackers on-line, they clipped the lines
and Telecom began tracking the winding path back to the originating
phone number. En route, the trail went dead. It was as if the hackers
knew they were being traced … almost as if they were manipulating
the telephone system to defeat the AFP investigation.</p>

<p id="id02322" class="calibre1">The next generation of hackers seemed to have a new-found
sophistication which frustrated AFP detectives at every turn. Then, on
13 October 1990, the AFP got lucky. Perhaps the hackers had been lazy
that day, or maybe they just had technical problems using their
traceless phreaking techniques. Prime Suspect couldn't use Trax's
traceless phreaking method from his home because he was on a
step-by-step exchange, and sometimes Trax didn't use the technique.
Whatever the reason, Telecom managed to successfully complete two line
traces from RMIT and the AFP now had two addresses and two names.
Prime Suspect and Trax.</p>

<p id="id02323" class="calibre1">`Hello, Prime Suspect.'</p>

<p id="id02324" class="calibre1">`Hiya, Mendax. How's tricks?'</p>

<p id="id02325" class="calibre1">`Good. Did you see that RMIT email? The one in Geoff Huston's
mailbox?' Mendax walked over to open a window as he spoke. It was
spring, 1991, and the weather was unseasonably warm.</p>

<p id="id02326" class="calibre1">`I did. Pretty amazing. RMIT looks like it will finally be getting rid
of those line traces.'</p>

<p id="id02327" class="calibre1">`RMIT definitely wants out,' Mendax said emphatically.</p>

<p id="id02328" class="calibre1">`Yep. Looks like the people at RMIT are sick of Mr Day crawling all
over their computers with line traces.'</p>

<p id="id02329" class="calibre1">`Yeah. That admin at RMIT was pretty good, standing up to AARNET and
the AFP. I figure Geoff Huston must be giving him a hard time.'</p>

<p id="id02330" class="calibre1">`I bet.' Prime Suspect paused. `You reckon the Feds have dropped the
line traces for real?'</p>

<p id="id02331" class="calibre1">`Looks like it. I mean if RMIT kicks them out, there isn't much the
Feds can do without the uni's cooperation. The letter sounded like
they just wanted to get on with securing their systems. Hang on. I've
got it here.'</p>

<p id="id02332" class="calibre1">Mendax pulled up a letter on his computer and scrolled through it.</p>

<p id="id02343" class="calibre1">Subject: Re: Hackers</p>

<p id="id02344" class="calibre1">Status: RO</p>

<p id="id02345" class="calibre1">While no one would disagree that `Hacking' is bad and should be
stopped, or at least minimised there are several observations which I
have made over the last six or eight months relating to the persuit of
these people:</p>

<p id="id02346" class="calibre1">1. The cost involved was significant, we had a CSO working in
conjunction with the Commonwealth Police for almost three months full
time.</p>

<p id="id02347" class="calibre1">2. While not a criticism of our staff, people lost sight of the ball,
the chase became the most important aspect of the whole exercise.</p>

<p id="id02348" class="calibre1">3. Catching Hackers (and charging them) is almost impossible, you have
to virtually break into their premises and catch them logged on to an
unauthorised machine.</p>

<p id="id02349" class="calibre1">4. If you do happen to catch and charge them, the cost of prosecution
is high, and a successful outcome is by no ways assured. There may be
some deterrent value in at least catching and prosecuting?</p>

<p id="id02350" class="calibre1">5. Continued pursuit of people involved requires doors to be left
open, this unfortunately exposes other sites and has subjected us to
some criticism.</p>

<p id="id02351" class="calibre1">The whole issue is very complex, and in some respects it is a case of
diminishing returns. A fine balance has to be maintained between
freedom, and the prevention of abuse, this appears to be the
challenge.</p>

<p id="id02352" class="calibre1">Allan Young</p>

<h5 id="id02353" class="calibre9">RMIT</h5>

<p id="id02354" class="calibre1">`Yeah, I mean, this RMIT guy is basically saying they are not going to
catch us anyway, so why are they wasting all this time and money?'</p>

<p id="id02355" class="calibre1">`Yep. The Feds were in there for at least three months,' Prime Suspect
said. `Sounded more like nine months though.'</p>

<p id="id02356" class="calibre1">`Hmm. Yeah, nothing we didn't know already though.'</p>

<p id="id02357" class="calibre1">`Pretty obvious, leaving those accounts open all the time like they
did. I reckon that looked pretty suspicious, even if we hadn't gotten
the email.'</p>

<p id="id02358" class="calibre1">`Definitely,' Mendax agreed. `Lots of other hackers in RMIT too. I
wonder if they figured it out.'</p>

<p id="id02359" class="calibre1">`Hmm. They're gonna be screwed if they haven't been careful.'</p>

<p id="id02360" class="calibre1">`I don't think the Feds have gotten anyone though.'</p>

<p id="id02361" class="calibre1">`Yeah?' Prime Suspect asked.</p>

<p id="id02362" class="calibre1">`Well, if they had, why would they leave those accounts open? Why
would RMIT keep a full-time staff person on?'</p>

<p id="id02363" class="calibre1">`Doesn't make sense.'</p>

<p id="id02364" class="calibre1">`No,' Mendax said. `I'd be pretty sure RMIT has kicked them out.'</p>

<p id="id02365" class="calibre1">`Yeah, told them, "You had you're chance, boys. Couldn't catch anyone.<br class="calibre4"/>

Now pack your bags".'<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02366" class="calibre1">`Right.' Mendax paused. `Don't know about NorTel though.'</p>

<p id="id02367" class="calibre1">`Mmm, yeah,' Prime Suspect said. Then, as usual, a silence began to
descend on the conversation.</p>

<p id="id02368" class="calibre1">`Running out of things to say …' Mendax said finally. They were good
enough friends for him to be blunt with Prime Suspect.</p>

<p id="id02369" class="calibre1">`Yeah.'</p>

<p id="id02370" class="calibre1">More silence.</p>

<p id="id02371" class="calibre1">Mendax thought how strange it was to be such good friends with
someone, to work so closely with him, and yet to always run out of
conversation.</p>

<p id="id02372" class="calibre1">`OK, well, I better go. Things to do,' Mendax said in a friendly
voice.</p>

<p id="id02373" class="calibre1">`Yeah, OK. Bye Mendax,' Prime Suspect said cheerfully.</p>

<p id="id02374" class="calibre1">Mendax hung up.</p>

<p id="id02375" class="calibre1">Prime Suspect hung up.</p>

<p id="id02376" class="calibre1">And the AFP stayed on the line.</p>

<p id="id02377" class="calibre1">In the twelve months following the initial line trace in late 1990,
the AFP continued to monitor the RMIT dial-up lines. The line traces
kept failing again and again. But as new reports of hacker attacks
rolled in, there seemed to be a discernible pattern in many of the
attacks. Detectives began to piece together a picture of their prey.</p>

<p id="id02378" class="calibre1">In 1990 and 1991, RMIT dial-ups and computers were riddled with
hackers, many of whom used the university's systems as a nest—a place
to store files, and launch further attacks. They frolicked in the
system almost openly, often using RMIT as a place to chat on-line with
each other. The institute served as the perfect launchpad. It was only
a local phone call away, it had a live Internet connection, a
reasonably powerful set of computers and very poor security. Hacker
heaven.</p>

<p id="id02379" class="calibre1">The police knew this, and they asked computer staff to keep the
security holes open so they could monitor hacker activity. With
perhaps a dozen different hackers—maybe more—inside RMIT, the task
of isolating a single cell of two or three organised hackers
responsible for the more serious attacks was not going to be easy.</p>

<p id="id02380" class="calibre1">By the middle of 1991, however, there was a growing reluctance among
some RMIT staff to continue leaving their computers wide open. On 28
August, Allan Young, the head of RMIT's Electronic Communications
Group, told the AFP that the institute wanted to close up the security
holes. The AFP did not like this one bit, but when they complained
Young told them, in essence, go talk to Geoff Huston at AARNET and to
the RMIT director.</p>

<p id="id02381" class="calibre1">The AFP was being squeezed out, largely because they had taken so long
conducting their investigation. RMIT couldn't reveal the AFP
investigation to anyone, so it was being embarrassed in front of
dozens of other research institutions which assumed it had no idea how
to secure its computers. Allan Young couldn't go to a conference with
other AARNET representatives without being hassled about `the hacker
problem' at RMIT. Meanwhile, his computer staff lost time playing
cops-and-robbers—and ignored their real work.</p>

<p id="id02382" class="calibre1">However, as RMIT prepared to phase out the AFP traps, the police had a
lucky break from a different quarter—NorTel. On 16 September, a line
trace from a NorTel dial-up, initiated after a complaint about the
hackers to the police, was successful. A fortnight later, on 1
October, the AFP began tapping Prime Suspect's telephone. The hackers
might be watching the police watch them, but the police were closing
in. The taps led back to Trax, and then to someone new—Mendax.</p>

<p id="id02383" class="calibre1">The AFP considered putting taps on Mendax and Trax's telephones as
well. It was a decision to be weighed up carefully. Telephone taps
were expensive, and often needed to be in place for at least a month.
They did, however, provide a reliable record of exactly what the
hacker was doing on-line.</p>

<p id="id02384" class="calibre1">Before police could move on setting up additional taps in Operation
Weather, the plot took another dramatic turn when one of the IS
hackers did something which took the AFP completely by surprise.</p>

<p id="id02385" class="calibre1">Trax turned himself in to the police.</p>

<p id="id02386" class="calibre1">On 29 October Prime Suspect was celebrating. His mum had cooked him a
nice dinner in honour of finishing his year 12 classes, and then
driven him to Vermont for a swot-vac party. When she arrived back home
she pottered around for an hour and a half, feeding her old dog Lizzy
and tidying up. At 11 p.m. she decided to call it a night.</p>

<p id="id02387" class="calibre1">Not much later, Lizzy barked.</p>

<p id="id02388" class="calibre1">`Are you home so soon?' Prime Suspect's mother called out. `Party not
much fun?'</p>

<p id="id02389" class="calibre1">No-one answered.</p>

<p id="id02390" class="calibre1">She sat up in bed. When there was still no answer, her mind raced to
reports of a spate of burglaries in the neighbourhood. There had even
been a few assaults.</p>

<p id="id02391" class="calibre1">A muffled male voice came from outside the front door. `Ma'am. Open
the door.'</p>

<p id="id02392" class="calibre1">She stood up and walked to the front door.</p>

<p id="id02393" class="calibre1">`Open the door. Police.'</p>

<p id="id02394" class="calibre1">`How do I know you're really the police?'</p>

<p id="id02395" class="calibre1">`If you don't open the door, we'll kick it in!' an exasperated male
voice shouted back at her from her front doorstep.</p>

<p id="id02396" class="calibre1">Prime Suspect's mother saw the outline of something being pressed
against the side window. She didn't have her reading glasses on, but
it looked like a police badge. Nervously, she opened the front door a
little bit and looked out.</p>

<p id="id02397" class="calibre1">There were eight or nine people on her doorstep. Before she could stop
them, they had pushed past her, swarming into her home.</p>

<p id="id02398" class="calibre1">A female officer began waving a piece of paper about. `Look at this!'<br class="calibre4"/>

She said angrily. `It's a warrant! Can you read it?'<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02399" class="calibre1">`No, actually I can't. I don't have my glasses on,' Prime Suspect's
mother answered curtly.</p>

<p id="id02400" class="calibre1">She told the police she wanted to make a phone call and tried to ring
her family solicitor, but without luck. He had been to a funeral and
wake and could not be roused. When she reached for the phone a second
time, one of the officers began lecturing her about making more phone
calls.</p>

<p id="id02401" class="calibre1">`You be quiet,' she said pointing her finger at the officer. Then she
made another unfruitful call.</p>

<p id="id02402" class="calibre1">Prime Suspect's mother looked at the police officers, sizing them up.
This was her home. She would show the police to her son's room, as
they requested, but she was not going to allow them to take over the
whole house. As she tartly instructed the police where they could and
could not go, she thought, I'm not standing for any nonsense from you
boys.</p>

<p id="id02403" class="calibre1">`Where's your son?' one officer asked her.</p>

<p id="id02404" class="calibre1">`At a party.'</p>

<p id="id02405" class="calibre1">`What is the address?'</p>

<p id="id02406" class="calibre1">She eyed him warily. She did not like these officers at all. However,
they would no doubt wait until her son returned anyway, so she handed
over the address.</p>

<p id="id02407" class="calibre1">While the police swarmed though Prime Suspect's room, gathering his
papers, computer, modem and other belongings, his mother waited in his
doorway where she could keep an eye on them.</p>

<p id="id02408" class="calibre1">Someone knocked at the door. An AFP officer and Prime Suspect's mother
both went to answer it.</p>

<p id="id02409" class="calibre1">It was the police—the state police.</p>

<p id="id02410" class="calibre1">The next-door neighbours had heard a commotion. When they looked out
of their window they saw a group of strange men in street clothes
brazenly taking things from the widow's home as if they owned the
place. So the neighbours did what any responsible person would in the
circumstances. They called the police.</p>

<p id="id02411" class="calibre1">The AFP officers sent the Victoria Police on their way. Then some of
them set off in a plain car for the Vermont party. Wanting to save
Prime Suspect some embarrassment in front of his friends, his mother
rang him at the party and suggested he wait outside for the AFP.</p>

<p id="id02412" class="calibre1">As soon as Prime Suspect hung up the phone he tried to shake off the
effect of a vast quantity of alcohol. When the police pulled up
outside, the party was in full swing. Prime Suspect was very drunk,
but he seemed to sober up quite well when the AFP officers introduced
themselves and packed him into the car.</p>

<p id="id02413" class="calibre1">`So,' said one of the officers as they headed toward his home, `what
are you more worried about? What's on your disks or what's in your
desk drawer?'</p>

<p id="id02414" class="calibre1">Prime Suspect thought hard. What was in his desk drawer? Oh shit! The
dope. He didn't smoke much, just occasionally for fun, but he had a
tiny amount of marijuana left over from a party.</p>

<p id="id02415" class="calibre1">He didn't answer. He looked out the window and tried not to look
nervous.</p>

<p id="id02416" class="calibre1">At his house, the police asked him if he would agree to an interview.</p>

<p id="id02417" class="calibre1">`I don't think so. I'm feeling a little … under the weather at the
moment,' he said. Doing a police interview would be difficult enough.
Doing it drunk would be just plain dangerous.</p>

<p id="id02418" class="calibre1">After the police carted away the last of his hacking gear, Prime
Suspect signed the official seizure forms and watched them drive off
in to the night.</p>

<p id="id02419" class="calibre1">Returning to his bedroom, he sat down, distracted, and tried to gather
his thoughts. Then he remembered the dope. He opened his desk drawer.
It was still there. Funny people, these feds.</p>

<p id="id02420" class="calibre1">Then again, maybe it made sense. Why would they bother with some tiny
amount of dope that was hardly worth the paperwork? His nervousness
over a couple of joints must have seemed laughable to the feds. They
had just seized enough evidence of hacking to lock him up for years,
depending on the judge, and here he was sweating about a thimbleful of
marijuana which might land him a $100 fine.</p>

<p id="id02421" class="calibre1">As the late spring night began to cool down, Prime Suspect wondered
whether the AFP had raided Mendax and Trax.</p>

<p id="id02422" class="calibre1">At the party, before the police had shown up, he had tried to ring
Mendax. From his mother's description when she called him, it sounded
as if the entire federal police force was in his house at that moment.
Which could mean that only one other IS hacker had gone down at the
same time. Unless he was the last to be raided, Mendax or Trax might
still be unaware of what was happening.</p>

<p id="id02423" class="calibre1">As he waited for the police to pick him up, a very drunk Prime Suspect
tried to ring Mendax again. Busy. He tried again. And again. The
maddening buzz of an engaged signal only made Prime Suspect more
nervous.</p>

<p id="id02424" class="calibre1">There was no way to get through, no way to warn him.</p>

<p id="id02425" class="calibre1">Prime Suspect wondered whether the police had actually shown up at
Mendax's and whether, if he had been able to get through, his phone
call would have made any difference at all.</p>

<p id="id02426" class="calibre2">The house looked like it had been ransacked. It had been ransacked, by
Mendax's wife, on her way out. Half the furniture was missing, and the
other half was in disarray. Dresser drawers hung open with their
contents removed, and clothing lay scattered around the room.</p>

<p id="id02427" class="calibre1">When his wife left him, she didn't just take their toddler child. She
took a number of things which had sentimental value to Mendax. When
she insisted on taking the CD player she had given him for his
twentieth birthday just a few months before, he asked her to leave a
lock of her hair behind for him in its place. He still couldn't
believe his wife of three years had packed up and left him.</p>

<p id="id02428" class="calibre1">The last week of October had been a bad one for Mendax. Heartbroken,
he had sunk into a deep depression. He hadn't eaten properly for days,
he drifted in and out of a tortured sleep, and he had even lost the
desire to use his computer. His prized hacking disks, filled with
highly incriminating stolen computer access codes, were normally
stored in a secure hiding place. But on the evening of 29 October
1991, thirteen disks were strewn around his $700 Amiga 500. A
fourteenth disk was in the computer's disk drive.</p>

<p id="id02429" class="calibre1">Mendax sat on a couch reading Soledad Brother, the prison
letters from George Jackson's nine-year stint in one of the toughest
prisons in the US. Convicted for a petty crime, Jackson was supposed
to be released after a short sentence but was kept in the prison at
the governor's pleasure. The criminal justice system kept him on a
merry-go-round of hope and despair as the authorities dragged their
feet. Later, prison guards shot and killed Jackson. The book was one
of Mendax's favourites, but it offered little distraction from his
unhappiness.</p>

<p id="id02430" class="calibre1">The droning sound of a telephone fault signal—like a busy
signal—filled the house. Mendax had hooked up his stereo speakers to
his modem and computer, effectively creating a speaker phone so he
could listen to tones he piped from his computer into the telephone
line and the ones which came back from the exchange in reply. It was
perfect for using Trax's MFC phreaking methods.</p>

<p id="id02431" class="calibre1">Mendax also used the system for scanning. Most of the time, he picked
telephone prefixes in the Melbourne CBD. When his modem hit another,
Mendax would rush to his computer and note the telephone number for
future hacking exploration.</p>

<p id="id02432" class="calibre1">By adjusting the device, he could also make it simulate a phreaker's
black box. The box would confuse the telephone exchange into thinking
he had not answered his phone, thus allowing Mendax's friends to call
him for free for 90 seconds.</p>

<p id="id02433" class="calibre1">On this night, however, the only signal Mendax was sending out was
that he wanted to be left alone. He hadn't been calling any computer
systems. The abandoned phone, with no connection to a remote modem,
had timed out and was beeping off the hook.</p>

<p id="id02434" class="calibre1">It was strange behaviour for someone who had spent most of his teenage
years trying to connect to the outside world through telephone lines
and computers, but Mendax had listened all day to the hypnotic sound
of a phone off the hook resonating through each room. BEEEP. Pause.
BEEEP. Pause. Endlessly.</p>

<p id="id02435" class="calibre1">A loud knock at the door punctured the stereo thrum of the phone.</p>

<p id="id02436" class="calibre1">Mendax looked up from his book to see a shadowy figure through the
frosted glass panes of the front door. The figure was quite short. It
looked remarkably like Ratface, an old school friend of Mendax's wife
and a character known for his practical jokes.</p>

<p id="id02437" class="calibre1">Mendax called out, `Who is it?' without moving from the sofa.</p>

<p id="id02438" class="calibre1">`Police. Open up.'</p>

<p id="id02439" class="calibre1">Yeah, sure. At 11.30 p.m.? Mendax rolled his eyes toward the door.
Everyone knew that the police only raid your house in the early
morning, when they know you are asleep and vulnerable.</p>

<p id="id02440" class="calibre1">Mendax dreamed of police raids all the time. He dreamed of footsteps
crunching on the driveway gravel, of shadows in the pre-dawn darkness,
of a gun-toting police squad bursting through his backdoor at 5 a.m.
He dreamed of waking from a deep sleep to find several police officers
standing over his bed. The dreams were very disturbing. They
accentuated his growing paranoia that the police were watching him,
following him.</p>

<p id="id02441" class="calibre1">The dreams had become so real that Mendax often became agitated in the
dead hour before dawn. At the close of an all-night hacking session,
he would begin to feel very tense, very strung out. It was not until
the computer disks, filled with stolen computer files from his hacking
adventures, were stored safely in their hiding place that he would
begin to calm down.</p>

<p id="id02442" class="calibre1">`Go away, Ratface, I'm not in the mood,' Mendax said, returning to his
book.</p>

<p id="id02443" class="calibre1">The voice became louder, more insistent, `Police. Open the door. NOW'.
Other figures were moving around behind the glass, shoving police
badges and guns against the window pane. Hell. It really was the
police!</p>

<p id="id02444" class="calibre1">Mendax's heart started racing. He asked the police to show him their
search warrant. They obliged immediately, pressing it against the
glass as well. Mendax opened the door to find nearly a dozen
plain-clothes police waiting for him.</p>

<p id="id02445" class="calibre1">`I don't believe this,' he said in a bewildered voice `My wife just
left me. Can't you come back later?'</p>

<p id="id02446" class="calibre1">At the front of the police entourage was Detective Sergeant Ken Day,
head of the AFP's Computer Crimes Unit in the southern region. The two
knew all about each other, but had never met in person. Day spoke
first.</p>

<p id="id02447" class="calibre1">`I'm Ken Day. I believe you've been expecting me.'</p>

<p id="id02448" class="calibre1">Mendax and his fellow IS hackers had been expecting the AFP. For weeks
they had been intercepting electronic mail suggesting that the police
were closing the net. So when Day turned up saying, `I believe you've
been expecting me,' he was completing the information circle. The
circle of the police watching the hackers watching the police watch
them.</p>

<p id="id02449" class="calibre1">It's just that Mendax didn't expect the police at that particular
moment. His mind was a tangle and he looked in disbelief at the band
of officers on his front step. Dazed, he looked at Day and then spoke
out loud, as if talking to himself, `But you're too short to be a
cop.'</p>

<p id="id02450" class="calibre1">Day looked surprised. `Is that meant to be an insult?' he said.</p>

<p id="id02451" class="calibre1">It wasn't. Mendax was in denial and it wasn't until the police had
slipped past him into the house that the reality of the situation
slowly began to sink in. Mendax's mind started to work again.</p>

<p id="id02452" class="calibre1">The disks. The damn disks. The beehive.</p>

<p id="id02453" class="calibre1">An avid apiarist, Mendax kept his own hive. Bees fascinated him. He
liked to watch them interact, to see their sophisticated social
structure. So it was with particular pleasure that he enlisted their
help in hiding his hacking activities. For months he had meticulously
secreted the disks in the hive. It was the ideal location—unlikely,
and well guarded by 60000 flying things with stings. Though he hadn't
bought the hive specifically for hiding stolen computer account
passwords for the likes of the US Air Force 7th Command Group in the
Pentagon, it appeared to be a secure hiding place.</p>

<p id="id02454" class="calibre1">He had replaced the cover of the super box, which housed the
honeycomb, with a sheet of coloured glass so he could watch the bees
at work. In summer, he put a weather protector over the glass. The
white plastic cover had raised edges and could be fastened securely to
the glass sheet with metal clasps. As Mendax considered his
improvements to the bee box, he realised that this hive could provide
more than honey. He carefully laid out the disks between the glass and
the weather protector. They fitted perfectly in the small gap.</p>

<p id="id02455" class="calibre1">Mendax had even trained the bees not to attack him as he removed and
replaced the disks every day. He collected sweat from his armpits on
tissues and then soaked the tissues in a sugar water solution. He fed
this sweaty nectar to the bees. Mendax wanted the bees to associate
him with flowers instead of a bear, the bees' natural enemy.</p>

<p id="id02456" class="calibre1">But on the evening of the AFP raid Mendax's incriminating disks were
in full view on the computer table and the officers headed straight
for them. Ken Day couldn't have hoped for better evidence. The disks
were full of stolen userlists, encrypted passwords, cracked passwords,
modem telephone numbers, documents revealing security flaws in various
computer systems, and details of the AFP's own investigation—all from
computer systems Mendax had penetrated illegally.</p>

<p id="id02457" class="calibre1">Mendax's problems weren't confined to the beehive disks. The last<br class="calibre4"/>

thing he had done on the computer the day before was still on screen.<br class="calibre4"/>

It was a list of some 1500 accounts, their passwords, the dates that<br class="calibre4"/>

Mendax had obtained them and a few small notes beside each one.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02458" class="calibre1">The hacker stood to the side as the police and two Telecom Protective
Services officers swarmed through the house. They photographed his
computer equipment and gathered up disks, then ripped up the carpet so
they could videotape the telephone cord running to his modem. They
scooped up every book, no small task since Mendax was an avid reader,
and held each one upside down looking for hidden computer passwords on
loose pieces of paper. They grabbed every bit of paper with
handwriting on it and poured through his love letters, notebooks and
private diaries. `We don't care how long it takes to do this job,' one
cop quipped. `We're getting paid overtime. And danger money.'</p>

<p id="id02459" class="calibre1">The feds even riffled through Mendax's collection of old Scientific
American and New Scientist magazines. Maybe they thought he had
underlined a word somewhere and turned it into a passphrase for an
encryption program.</p>

<p id="id02460" class="calibre1">Of course, there was only one magazine the feds really wanted:
International Subversive. They scooped up every print-out of the
electronic journal they could find.</p>

<p id="id02461" class="calibre1">As Mendax watched the federal police sift through his possessions and
disassemble his computer room, an officer who had some expertise with
Amigas arrived. He told Mendax to get the hell out of the computer
room.</p>

<p id="id02462" class="calibre1">Mendax didn't want to leave the room. He wasn't under arrest and
wanted to make sure the police didn't plant anything. So he looked at
the cop and said, `This is my house and I want to stay in this room.
Am I under arrest or not?'</p>

<p id="id02463" class="calibre1">The cop snarled back at him, `Do you want to be under arrest?'</p>

<p id="id02464" class="calibre1">Mendax acquiesced and Day, who was far more subtle in his approach,
walked the hacker into another room for questioning. He turned to
Mendax and asked, with a slight grin, `So, what's it like being
busted? Is it like Nom told you?'</p>

<p id="id02465" class="calibre1">Mendax froze.</p>

<p id="id02466" class="calibre1">There were only two ways that Day could have known Nom had told Mendax
about his bust. Nom might have told him, but this was highly unlikely.
Nom's hacking case had not yet gone to court and Nom wasn't exactly on
chummy terms with the police. The other alternative was that the AFP
had been tapping telephones in Mendax's circle of hackers, which the
IS trio had strongly suspected. Talking in a three-way phone
conversation with Mendax and Trax, Nom had relayed the story of his
bust. Mendax later relayed Nom's story to Prime Suspect—also on the
phone. Harbouring suspicions is one thing. Having them confirmed by a
senior AFP officer is quite another.</p>

<p id="id02467" class="calibre1">Day pulled out a tape recorder, put it on the table, turned it on and
began asking questions. When Mendax told Day he wouldn't answer him,
Day turned the recorder off. `We can talk off the record if you want,'
he told the hacker.</p>

<p id="id02468" class="calibre1">Mendax nearly laughed out loud. Police were not journalists. There was
no such thing as an off-the-record conversation between a suspect and
a police officer.</p>

<p id="id02469" class="calibre1">Mendax asked to speak to a lawyer. He said he wanted to call
Alphaline, a free after-hours legal advice telephone service. Day
agreed, but when he picked up the telephone to inspect it before
handing it over to Mendax, something seemed amiss. The phone had an
unusual, middle-pitched tone which Day didn't seem to recognise.
Despite there being two Telecom employees and numerous police
specialists in the house, Day appeared unable to determine the cause
of the funny tone. He looked Mendax dead in the eye and said, `Is this
a hijacked telephone line?'</p>

<p id="id02470" class="calibre1">Hijacked? Day's comment took Mendax by surprise. What surprised him
was not that Day suspected him of hijacking the line, but rather that
he didn't know whether the line had been manipulated.</p>

<p id="id02471" class="calibre1">`Well, don't you know?' he taunted Day.</p>

<p id="id02472" class="calibre1">For the next half hour, Day and the other officers picked apart
Mendax's telephone, trying to work out what sort of shenanigans the
hacker had been up to. They made a series of calls to see if the
long-haired youth had somehow rewired his telephone line, perhaps to
make his calls untraceable.</p>

<p id="id02473" class="calibre1">In fact, the dial tone on Mendax's telephone was the very normal sound
of a tone-dial telephone on an ARE-11 telephone exchange. The tone was
simply different from the ones generated by other exchange types, such
as AXE and step-by-step exchanges.</p>

<p id="id02474" class="calibre1">Finally Mendax was allowed to call a lawyer at Alphaline. The lawyer
warned the hacker not to say anything. He said the police could offer
a sworn statement to the court about anything the hacker said, and
then added that the police might even be wired.</p>

<p id="id02475" class="calibre1">Next, Day tried the chummy approach at getting information from the
hacker. `Just between you and me, are you Mendax?' he asked.</p>

<p id="id02476" class="calibre1">Silence.</p>

<p id="id02477" class="calibre1">Day tried another tactic. Hackers have a well-developed sense of
ego—a flaw Day no doubt believed he could tap into.</p>

<p id="id02478" class="calibre1">`There have been a lot of people over the years running around
impersonating you—using your handle,' he said.</p>

<p id="id02479" class="calibre1">Mendax could see Day was trying to manipulate him but by this stage he
didn't care. He figured that the police already had plenty of evidence
that linked him to his handle, so he admitted to it.</p>

<p id="id02480" class="calibre1">Day had some other surprising questions up his sleeve.</p>

<p id="id02481" class="calibre1">`So, Mendax, what do you know about that white powder in the bedroom?'</p>

<p id="id02482" class="calibre1">Mendax couldn't recall any white powder in the bedroom. He didn't do
drugs, so why would there be any white powder anywhere? He watched two
police officers bringing two large red toolboxes in the house—they
looked like drug testing kits. Jesus, Mendax thought. I'm being set
up.</p>

<p id="id02483" class="calibre1">The cops led the hacker into the bedroom and pointed to two neat lines
of white powder laid out on a bench.</p>

<p id="id02484" class="calibre1">Mendax smiled, relieved. `It's not what you think,' he said. The white
powder was glow-in-the-dark glue he had used to paint stars on the
ceiling of his child's bedroom.</p>

<p id="id02485" class="calibre1">Two of the cops started smiling at each other. Mendax could see
exactly what was going through their minds: It's not every cocaine or
speed user that can come up with a story like that.</p>

<p id="id02486" class="calibre1">One grinned at the other and exclaimed gleefully, `TASTE TEST!'</p>

<p id="id02487" class="calibre1">`That's not a good idea,' Mendax said, but his protests only made
things worse. The cops shooed him into another room and returned to
inspect the powder by themselves.</p>

<p id="id02488" class="calibre1">What Mendax really wanted was to get word through to Prime Suspect.
The cops had probably busted all three IS hackers at the same time,
but maybe not. While the police investigated the glue on their own,
Mendax managed to sneak a telephone call to his estranged wife and
asked her to call Prime Suspect and warn him. He and his wife might
have had their differences, but he figured she would make the call
anyway.</p>

<p id="id02489" class="calibre1">When Mendax's wife reached Prime Suspect later that night, he replied,<br class="calibre4"/>

`Yeah, there's a party going on over here too.'<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02490" class="calibre1">Mendax went back in to the kitchen where an officer was tagging the
growing number of possessions seized by the police. One of the female
officers was struggling to move his printer to the pile. She smiled
sweetly at Mendax and asked if he would move it for her. He obliged.</p>

<p id="id02491" class="calibre1">The police finally left Mendax's house at about 3 a.m. They had spent
three and half hours and seized 63 bundles of his personal belongings,
but they had not charged him with a single crime.</p>

<p id="id02492" class="calibre1">When the last of the unmarked police cars had driven away, Mendax
stepped out into the silent suburban street. He looked around. After
making sure that no-one was watching him, he walked to a nearby phone
booth and rang Trax.</p>

<p id="id02493" class="calibre1">`The AFP raided my house tonight.' he warned his friend. `They just
left.'</p>

<p id="id02494" class="calibre1">Trax sounded odd, awkward. `Oh. Ah. I see.'</p>

<p id="id02495" class="calibre1">`Is there something wrong? You sound strange,' Mendax said.</p>

<p id="id02496" class="calibre1">`Ah. No … no, nothing's wrong. Just um … tired. So, um … so the
feds could … ah, be here any minute …' Trax's voice trailed off.</p>

<p id="id02497" class="calibre1">But something was very wrong. The AFP were already at Trax's house,
and they had been there for 10 hours.</p>

<p id="id02498" class="calibre1">The IS hackers waited almost three years to be charged. The threat of
criminal charges hung over their heads like personalised Swords of
Damocles. They couldn't apply for a job, make a friend at TAFE or plan
for the future without worrying about what would happen as a result of
the AFP raids of 29 October 1991.</p>

<p id="id02499" class="calibre1">Finally, in July 1994, each hacker received formal charges—in the
mail. During the intervening years, all three hackers went through
monumental changes in their lives.</p>

<p id="id02500" class="calibre1">Devastated by the break-down of his marriage and unhinged by the AFP
raid, Mendax sank into a deep depression and consuming anger. By the
middle of November 1991, he was admitted to hospital.</p>

<p id="id02501" class="calibre1">He hated hospital, its institutional regimens and game-playing
shrinks. Eventually, he told the doctors he wanted out. He might be
crazy, but hospital was definitely making him crazier. He left there
and stayed at his mother's house. The next year was the worst of his
life.</p>

<p id="id02502" class="calibre1">Once a young person leaves home—particularly the home of a
strong-willed parent—it becomes very difficult for him or her to
return. Short visits might work, but permanent residency often fails.
Mendax lived for a few days at home, then went walkabout. He slept in
the open air, on the banks of rivers and creeks, in grassy
meadows—all on the country fringes of Melbourne's furthest suburbs.
Sometimes he travelled closer to the city, overnighting in places like
the Merri Creek reserve.</p>
