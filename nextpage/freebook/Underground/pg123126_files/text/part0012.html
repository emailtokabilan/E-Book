<p id="id02970" class="calibre1">`No. Before. I just said, "I don't want anything to do with this any
more. It's just stupid". When I broke up with my girlfriend … I just
got dragged into it again. I'm not trying to say that I am any less
responsible for any of this but I will say I didn't originate any of
these 008s. They were all scanned by other people. But I made calls
and admittedly I did a lot of stupid things.'</p>

<p id="id02971" class="calibre1">But Sexton was like a dog with a bone.</p>

<p id="id02972" class="calibre1">`I just felt that you were tending to … I don't know if it's because
your dad's here or … I have read stuff that "Anthrax was a legend
when it came to this, and he was a scanner, and he was the man to talk
to about X.25, Tymnet, hacking, Unix. The whole kit and kaboodle".'</p>

<p id="id02973" class="calibre1">Anthrax didn't take the bait. Cops always try that line. Play on a
hacker's ego, get them to brag. It was so transparent.</p>

<p id="id02974" class="calibre1">`It's not true,' he answered. `I know nothing about … I can't
program. I have an Amiga with one meg of memory. I have no formal
background in computers whatsoever.'</p>

<p id="id02975" class="calibre1">That part was definitely true. Everything was self-taught. Well,
almost everything. He did take one programming class at uni, but he
failed it. He went to the library to do extra research, used in his
final project for the course. Most of his classmates wrote simple
200-line programs with few functions; his ran to 500 lines and had
lots of special functions. But the lecturer flunked him. She told him,
`The functions in your program were not taught in this course'.</p>

<p id="id02976" class="calibre1">Sexton asked Anthrax if he was into carding, which he denied
emphatically. Then Sexton headed back into scanning. How much had
Anthrax done? Had he given scanned numbers to other hackers? Anthrax
was evasive, and both cops were getting impatient.</p>

<p id="id02977" class="calibre1">`What I am trying to get at is that I believe that, through your
scanning, you are helping other people break the law by promoting this
sort of thing.' Sexton had shown his hand.</p>

<p id="id02978" class="calibre1">`No more than a telephone directory would be assisting someone,
because it's really just a list. I didn't actually break anything. I
just looked at it.'</p>

<p id="id02979" class="calibre1">`These voice mailbox systems obviously belong to people. What would
you do when you found a VMB?'</p>

<p id="id02980" class="calibre1">`Just play with it. Give it to someone and say, "Have a look at this.<br class="calibre4"/>

It is interesting," or whatever.'<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02981" class="calibre1">`When you say play with it you would break the code out to the VMB?'</p>

<p id="id02982" class="calibre1">`No. Just have a look around. I'm not very good at breaking VMBs.'</p>

<p id="id02983" class="calibre1">Sexton tried a different tack. `What are 1-900 numbers? On the back of
that document there is a 1-900 number. What are they generally for?'</p>

<p id="id02984" class="calibre1">Easy question. `In America they like cost $10 a minute. You can ring
them up, I think, and get all sorts of information, party lines, etc.'</p>

<p id="id02985" class="calibre1">`It's a conference type of call?'</p>

<p id="id02986" class="calibre1">`Yes.'</p>

<p id="id02987" class="calibre1">`Here is another document, contained in a clear plastic sleeve
labelled AS/AB/S/1. Is this a scan? Do you recognise your
handwriting?'</p>

<p id="id02988" class="calibre1">`Yes, it's in my handwriting. Once again it's the same sort of scan.<br class="calibre4"/>

It's just dialling some commercial numbers and noting them.'<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02989" class="calibre1">`And once you found something, what would you do with it?'</p>

<p id="id02990" class="calibre1">Anthrax had no intention of being painted as some sort of ringleader
of a scanning gang. He was a sociable loner, not a part of a team.</p>

<p id="id02991" class="calibre1">`I'd just look at it, like in the case of this one here—630. I just
punched in a few numbers and it said that 113 diverts somewhere, 115
says goodbye, etc. I'd just do that and I probably never came back to
it again.'</p>

<p id="id02992" class="calibre1">`And you believe that if I pick up the telephone book, I would get all
this information?'</p>

<p id="id02993" class="calibre1">`No. It's just a list of numbers in the same sense that a telephone
book is.'</p>

<p id="id02994" class="calibre1">`What about a 1-800 number?'</p>

<p id="id02995" class="calibre1">`That is the same as a 0014.'</p>

<p id="id02996" class="calibre1">`If you rang a 1-800 number, where would you go?'</p>

<p id="id02997" class="calibre1">Anthrax wondered if the Computer Crimes Unit gained most of its
technical knowledge from interviews with hackers.</p>

<p id="id02998" class="calibre1">`You can either do 0014 or you can do 1-800. It's just the same.'</p>

<p id="id02999" class="calibre1">`Is it Canada—0014?'</p>

<p id="id03000" class="calibre1">`It's everywhere.' Oops. Don't sound too cocky. `Isn't it?'</p>

<p id="id03001" class="calibre1">`No, I'm not familiar.' Which is just what Anthrax was thinking.</p>

<p id="id03002" class="calibre1">Sexton moved on. `On the back of that document there is more type
scans …'</p>

<p id="id03003" class="calibre1">`It's all just the same thing. Just take a note of what is there. In
this case, box 544 belongs to this woman …'</p>

<p id="id03004" class="calibre1">`So, once again, you just release this type of information on the
bridge?'</p>

<p id="id03005" class="calibre1">`Not all of it. Most of it I would probably keep to myself and never
look at it again. I was bored. Is it illegal to scan?'</p>

<p id="id03006" class="calibre1">`I'm not saying it's illegal. I'm just trying to show that you were
really into this. I'm building a picture and I am gradually getting to
a point and I'm going to build a picture to show that for a while
there …' Sexton then interrupted himself and veered down a less
confrontational course. `I'm not saying you are doing it now, but back
then, when all these offences occurred, you were really into scanning
telephone systems, be it voice mailboxes … I'm not saying you found
the 008s but you … anything to bugger up Telecom. You were really
getting into it and you were helping other people.'</p>

<p id="id03007" class="calibre1">Anthrax took offence. `The motivation for me doing it wasn't to bugger
up Telecom.'</p>

<p id="id03008" class="calibre1">Sexton backpedalled. `Perhaps … probably a poor choice of words.'</p>

<p id="id03009" class="calibre1">He began pressing forward on the subject of hacking, something the
police had not said they were going to be discussing. Anthrax felt a
little unnerved, even rattled.</p>

<p id="id03010" class="calibre1">Day asked if Anthrax wanted a break.</p>

<p id="id03011" class="calibre1">`No,' he answered. `I just want to get it over and done with, if
that's OK. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to say "no comment".
I'm going to admit to everything 'cause, based on what I have been
told, it's in my best interest to do so.'</p>

<p id="id03012" class="calibre1">The police paused. They didn't seem to like that last comment much.<br class="calibre4"/>

Day tried to clear things up.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id03013" class="calibre1">`Before we go any further, based on what you have been told, it is in
your best interests to tell the truth. Was it any member of the AFP
that told you this?'</p>

<p id="id03014" class="calibre1">`Yes.'</p>

<p id="id03015" class="calibre1">`Who?' Day threw the question out quickly.</p>

<p id="id03016" class="calibre1">Anthrax couldn't remember their names. `The ones who came to my house.
I think Andrew also said it to me,' he said, nodding in the direction
of the red-headed constable.</p>

<p id="id03017" class="calibre1">Why were the cops getting so uncomfortable all of a sudden? It was no
secret that they had told both Anthrax and his mother repeatedly that
it was in his best interest to agree to an interview.</p>

<p id="id03018" class="calibre1">Day leaned forward, peered at Anthrax and asked, `What did you
interpret that to mean?'</p>

<p id="id03019" class="calibre1">`That if I don't tell the truth, if I say "no comment" and don't
cooperate, that it is going to be … it will mean that you will go
after me with …' Anthrax grasped for the right words, but he felt
tongue-tied, `with … more force, I guess.'</p>

<p id="id03020" class="calibre1">Both officers stiffened visibly.</p>

<p id="id03021" class="calibre1">Day came back again. `Do you feel that an unfair inducement has been
placed on you as a result of that?'</p>

<p id="id03022" class="calibre1">`In what sense?' The question was genuine.</p>

<p id="id03023" class="calibre1">`You have made the comment and it has now been recorded and I have to
clear it up. Do you feel like, that a deal has been offered to you at
any stage?'</p>

<p id="id03024" class="calibre1">A deal? Anthrax thought about it. It wasn't a deal as in `Talk to us
now and we will make sure you don't go to jail'. Or `Talk now and we
won't beat you with a rubber hose'.</p>

<p id="id03025" class="calibre1">`No,' he answered.</p>

<p id="id03026" class="calibre1">`Do you feel that as a result of that being said that you have been
pressured to come forward today and tell the truth?'</p>

<p id="id03027" class="calibre1">Ah, that sort of deal. Well, of course.</p>

<p id="id03028" class="calibre1">`Yes, I have been pressured,' Anthrax answered. The two police
officers looked stunned. Anthrax paused, concerned about the growing
feeling of disapproval in the room. `Indirectly,' he added quickly,
almost apologetically.</p>

<p id="id03029" class="calibre1">For a brief moment, Anthrax just didn't care. About the police. About
his father. About the pressure. He would tell the truth. He decided to
explain the situation as he saw it.</p>

<p id="id03030" class="calibre1">`Because since they came to my house, they emphasised the fact that if
I didn't come for an interview, that they would then charge my mother
and, as my mother is very sick, I am not prepared to put her through
that.'</p>

<p id="id03031" class="calibre1">The police looked at each other. The shock waves reverberated around
the room. The AFP clearly hadn't bargained on this coming out in the
interview tape. But what he said about his mother being threatened was
the truth, so let it be on the record with everything else.</p>

<p id="id03032" class="calibre1">Ken Day caught his breath, `So you are saying that you
have now been …' he cut himself off … `that you are not here
voluntarily?'</p>

<p id="id03033" class="calibre1">Anthrax thought about it. What did `voluntarily' mean? The police
didn't cuff him to a chair and tell him he couldn't leave until he
talked. They didn't beat him around the head with a baton. They
offered him a choice: talk or inflict the police on his ailing mother.
Not a palatable choice, but a choice nonetheless. He chose to talk to
protect his mother.</p>

<p id="id03034" class="calibre1">`I am here voluntarily,' he answered.</p>

<p id="id03035" class="calibre1">`That is not what you have said. What you have just said is
that pressure has been placed on you and that you have had to come in
here and answer the questions. Otherwise certain actions would take
place. That does not mean you are here
voluntarily.'</p>

<p id="id03036" class="calibre1">The police must have realised they were on very thin ice and Anthrax
felt pressure growing in the room. The cops pushed. His father did not
looked pleased.</p>

<p id="id03037" class="calibre1">`I was going to come anyway,' Anthrax answered, again almost
apologetically. Walk the tightrope, he thought. Don't get them too mad
or they will charge my mother. `You can talk to the people who carried
out the warrant. All along, I said to them I would come in for an
interview. Whatever my motivations are, I don't think should matter. I
am going to tell you the truth.'</p>

<p id="id03038" class="calibre1">`It does matter,' Day responded, `because at the beginning of the
interview it was stated—do you agree—that you have come in here
voluntarily?'</p>

<p id="id03039" class="calibre1">`I have. No-one has forced me.'</p>

<p id="id03040" class="calibre1">Anthrax felt exasperated. The room was getting stuffy. He wanted to
finish this thing and get out of there. So much pressure.</p>

<p id="id03041" class="calibre1">`And is anyone forcing you to make the answers you have given here
today?' Day tried again.</p>

<p id="id03042" class="calibre1">`No individuals are forcing me, no.' There. You have what you want.<br class="calibre4"/>

Now get on with it and let's get out of here.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id03043" class="calibre1">`You have to tell the truth. Is that what you are saying?' The police
would not leave the issue be.</p>

<p id="id03044" class="calibre1">`I want to tell the truth. As well.' The key words there were `as
well'. Anthrax thought, I want to and I have to.</p>

<p id="id03045" class="calibre1">`It's the circumstances that are forcing this upon you, not an
individual?'</p>

<p id="id03046" class="calibre1">`No.' Of course it was the circumstances. Never mind that the police
created the circumstance.</p>

<p id="id03047" class="calibre1">Anthrax felt as if the police were just toying with him. He knew and
they knew they would go after his mother if this interview wasn't to
their liking. Visions of his frail mother being hauled out of her
house by the AFP flashed through his mind. Anthrax felt sweaty and
hot. Just get on with it. Whatever makes them happy, just agree to it
in order to get out of this crowded room.</p>

<p id="id03048" class="calibre1">`So, would it be fair to summarise it, really, to say that perhaps …
of your activity before the police arrived at your premises, that is
what is forcing you?'</p>

<p id="id03049" class="calibre1">What was this cop talking about? His `activity' forcing him? Anthrax
felt confused. The interview had already gone on some time. The cops
had such obscure ways of asking things. The room was oppressively
small.</p>

<p id="id03050" class="calibre1">Day pressed on with the question, `The fact that you could see you had
broken the law, and that is what is forcing you to come forward here
today and tell the truth?'</p>

<p id="id03051" class="calibre1">Yeah. Whatever you want. `OK,' Anthrax started to answer, `That is a
fair assump—'</p>

<p id="id03052" class="calibre1">Day cut him off. `I just wanted to clarify that because the
interpretation I immediately got from that was that we, or members of
the AFP, had unfairly and unjustly forced you to come in here today,
and that is not the case?'</p>

<p id="id03053" class="calibre1">Define `unfairly'. Define `unjustly'. Anthrax thought it was unfair
the cops might charge his mother. But they told her it was perfectly
legal to do so. Anthrax felt light-headed. All these thoughts whirring
around inside his head.</p>

<p id="id03054" class="calibre1">`No, that is not the case. I'm sorry for …' Be humble. Get out of
that room faster.</p>

<p id="id03055" class="calibre1">`No, that is OK. If that is what you believe, say it. I have no
problems with that. I just like to have it clarified. Remember, other
people might listen to this tape and they will draw inferences and
opinions from it. At any point where I think there is an ambiguity, I
will ask for clarification. Do you understand that?'</p>

<p id="id03056" class="calibre1">`Yes. I understand.' Anthrax couldn't really focus on what Day was
saying. He was feeling very distressed and just wanted to finish the
interview.</p>

<p id="id03057" class="calibre1">The cops finally moved on, but the new topic was almost as unpleasant.
Day began probing about Anthrax's earlier hacking career—the one he
had no intention of talking about. Anthrax began to feel a bit better.
He agreed to talk to the police about recent phreaking activities, not
hacking matters. Indeed, he had repeatedly told them that topic was
not on his agenda. He felt like he was standing on firmer ground.</p>

<p id="id03058" class="calibre1">After being politely stonewalled, Day circled around and tried again.
`OK. I will give you another allegation; that you have unlawfully
accessed computer systems in Australia and the United States. In the
US, you specifically targeted military computer systems. Do you
understand that allegation?'</p>

<p id="id03059" class="calibre1">`I understand that. I wouldn't like to comment on it.' No, sir. No
way.</p>

<p id="id03060" class="calibre1">Day tried a new tack. `I will further allege that you did work with a
person known as Mendax.'</p>

<p id="id03061" class="calibre1">What on earth was Day talking about? Anthrax had heard of Mendax, but
they had never worked together. He thought the cops must not have very
good informants.</p>

<p id="id03062" class="calibre1">`No. That is not true. I know no-one of that name.' Not strictly true,
but true enough.</p>

<p id="id03063" class="calibre1">`Well, if he was to turn around to me and say that you were doing all
this hacking, he would be lying, would he?'</p>

<p id="id03064" class="calibre1">Oh wonderful. Some other hacker was crapping on to the cops with lies
about how he and Anthrax had worked together. That was exactly why
Anthrax didn't work in a group. He had plenty of real allegations to
fend off. He didn't need imaginary ones too.</p>

<p id="id03065" class="calibre1">`Most certainly would. Unless he goes by some other name, I know
no-one by that name, Mendax.' Kill that off quick.</p>

<p id="id03066" class="calibre1">In fact Mendax had not ratted on Anthrax at all. That was just a
technique the police used.</p>

<p id="id03067" class="calibre1">`You don't wish to comment on the fact that you have hacked into other
computer systems and military systems?' If there
was one thing Anthrax could say for Day, it was that he was
persistent.</p>

<p id="id03068" class="calibre1">`No. I would prefer not to comment on any of that. This is the advice
I have received: not to comment on anything unrelated to the topic
that I was told I would be talking about when I came down here.'</p>

<p id="id03069" class="calibre1">`All right, well are you going to answer any questions in relation to
unlawfully accessing any computer systems?'</p>

<p id="id03070" class="calibre1">`Based upon the legal advice that I received, I choose not to.'</p>

<p id="id03071" class="calibre1">Day pursed his lips. `All right. If that is your attitude and you
don't wish to answer any of those questions, we won't pursue the
matter. However, I will inform you now that the matter may be reported
and you may receive a summons to answer the questions or face charges
in relation to those allegations, and, at any time that you so choose,
you can come forward and tell us the truth.'</p>

<p id="id03072" class="calibre1">Woah. Anthrax took a deep breath. Could the cops make him come answer
questions with a summons? They were changing the game midway through.
Anthrax felt as though the carpet had been pulled out from beneath his
feet. He needed a few minutes to clear his head.</p>

<p id="id03073" class="calibre1">`Is it something I can think over and discuss?' Anthrax asked.</p>

<p id="id03074" class="calibre1">`Yes. Do you want to have a pause and a talk with your father? The
constable and I can step out of the room, or offer you another room.
You may wish to have a break and think about it if you like. I think
it might be a good idea. I think we might have a ten-minute break and
put you in another room and let you two have a chat about it. There is
no pressure.'</p>

<p id="id03075" class="calibre1">Day and the Sexton stopped the interview and guided father and son
into another room. Once they were alone, Anthrax looked to his father
for support. This voice inside him still cried out to keep away from
his earlier hacking journeys. He needed someone to tell him the same
thing.</p>

<p id="id03076" class="calibre1">His father was definitely not that someone. He railed against Anthrax
with considerable vehemence. Stop holding back. You have to tell
everything. How could you be so stupid? You can't fool the police.
They know. Confess it all before it's too late. At the end of the
ten-minute tirade, Anthrax felt worse than he had at the beginning.</p>

<p id="id03077" class="calibre1">When the two returned to the interview room, Anthrax's father turned
to the police and said suddenly, `He has decided to confess'.</p>

<p id="id03078" class="calibre1">That was not true. Anthrax hadn't decided anything of the sort. His
father was full of surprises. It seemed every time he opened his
mouth, an ugly surprise came out.</p>

<p id="id03079" class="calibre1">Ken Day and Andrew Sexton warmed up a shaky Anthrax by showing him
various documents, pieces of paper with Anthrax's scribbles seized
during the raid, telephone taps. At one stage, Day pointed to some
handwritten notes which read `KDAY'. He looked at Anthrax.</p>

<p id="id03080" class="calibre1">`What's that? That's me.'</p>

<p id="id03081" class="calibre1">Anthrax smiled for the first time in a long while. It was something to
be happy about. The head of the AFP's Computer Crime Unit in Melbourne
sat there, so sure he was onto something big. There was his name, bold
as day, in the hacker's handwriting on a bit of paper seized in a
raid. Day seemed to be expecting something good.</p>

<p id="id03082" class="calibre1">Anthrax said, `If you ring that up you will find it is a radio
station.' An American radio station. Written on the same bit of paper
were the names of an American clothing store, another US-based radio
station, and a few records he wanted to order.</p>

<p id="id03083" class="calibre1">`There you go,' Day laughed at his own hasty conclusions. `I've got a
radio station named after me.'</p>

<p id="id03084" class="calibre1">Day asked Anthrax why he wrote down all sorts of things, directory
paths, codes, error messages.</p>

<p id="id03085" class="calibre1">`Just part of the record-keeping. I think I wrote this down when I had
first been given this dial-up and I was just feeling my way around,
taking notes of what different things did.'</p>

<p id="id03086" class="calibre1">`What were your intentions at the time with these computer networks?'</p>

<p id="id03087" class="calibre1">`At this stage, I was just having a look, just a matter of curiosity.'</p>

<p id="id03088" class="calibre1">`Was it a matter of curiosity—"Gee, this is interesting" or was it
more like "I would like to get into them" at this stage?'</p>

<p id="id03089" class="calibre1">`I couldn't say what was going through my mind at the time. But
initially once I got into the first system—I'm sure you have heard
this a lot—but once you get into the first system, it's like you get
into the next one and the next one and the next one, after a while it
doesn't …' Anthrax couldn't find the right words to finish the
explanation.</p>

<p id="id03090" class="calibre1">`Once you have tasted the forbidden fruit?'</p>

<p id="id03091" class="calibre1">`Exactly. It's a good analogy.'</p>

<p id="id03092" class="calibre1">Day pressed on with questions about Anthrax's hacking. He successfully
elicited admissions from the hacker. Anthrax gave Day more than the
police officer had before, but probably not as much as he would have

<p id="id03093" class="calibre1">It was, however, enough. Enough to keep the police from charging<br class="calibre4"/>

Anthrax's mother. And enough for them to charge him.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id03094" class="calibre2">Anthrax didn't see his final list of charges until the day he appeared
in court on 28 August 1995. The whole case seemed to be a bit
disorganised. His Legal Aid lawyer had little knowledge of computers,
let alone computer crime. He told Anthrax he could ask for an
adjournment because he hadn't seen the final charges until so late,
but Anthrax wanted to get the thing over and done with. They had
agreed that Anthrax would plead guilty to the charges and hope for a
reasonable magistrate.</p>

<p id="id03095" class="calibre1">Anthrax looked through the hand-up brief provided by the prosecution,
which included a heavily edited transcript of his interview with the
police. It was labelled as a `summary', but it certainly didn't
summarise everything important in that interview. Either the
prosecution or the police had cut out all references to the fact that
the police had threatened to charge Anthrax's mother if he didn't
agree to be interviewed.</p>

<p id="id03096" class="calibre1">Anthrax pondered the matter. Wasn't everything relevant to his case
supposed to be covered in a hand-up brief? This seemed very relevant
to his case, yet there wasn't a mention of it anywhere in the
document. He began to wonder if the police had edited down the
transcript just so they could cut out that portion of the interview.
Perhaps the judge wouldn't be too happy about it. He thought that
maybe the police didn't want to be held accountable for how they had
dealt with his mother.</p>

<p id="id03097" class="calibre1">The rest of the hand-up brief wasn't much better. The only statement
by an actual `witness' to Anthrax's hacking was from his former
room-mate, who claimed that he had watched Anthrax break into a NASA
computer and access an `area of the computer system which showed the
latitude/longitude of ships'.</p>

<p id="id03098" class="calibre1">Did space ships even have longitudes and latitudes? Anthrax didn't
know. And he had certainly never broken into a NASA computer in front
of the room-mate. It was absurd. This guy is lying, Anthrax thought,
and five minutes under cross-examination by a reasonable lawyer would
illustrate as much. Anthrax's instincts told him the prosecution had a
flimsy case for some of the charges, but he felt overwhelmed by
pressure from all sides—his family, the bustle in the courtroom, even
the officiousness of his own lawyer quickly rustling through his
papers.</p>

<p id="id03099" class="calibre1">Anthrax looked around the room. His eyes fell on his father, who sat
waiting on the public benches. Anthrax's lawyer wanted him there to
give evidence during sentencing. He thought it would look good to show
there was a family presence. Anthrax gave the suggestion a cool
reception. But he didn't understand how courts worked, so he followed
his lawyer's advice.</p>

<p id="id03100" class="calibre1">Anthrax's mother was back at his apartment, waiting for news. She had
been on night duty and was supposed to be sleeping. That was the
ostensible reason she didn't attend. Anthrax thought perhaps that the
tension was too much for her. Whatever the reason, she didn't sleep
all that day. She tidied the place, washed the dishes, did the
laundry, and kept herself as busy as the tiny apartment would allow
her.</p>

<p id="id03101" class="calibre1">Anthrax's girlfriend, a pretty, moon-faced Turkish girl, also came to
court. She had never been into the hacking scene. A group of school
children, mostly girls, chatted in the rows behind her.</p>

<p id="id03102" class="calibre1">Anthrax read through the four-page summary of facts provided by the
prosecution. When he reached the final page, his heart stopped. The
final paragraph said:</p>

<p id="id03103" class="calibre1">31. Penalty</p>

<p id="id03104" class="calibre1">s85ZF (a)—12 months, $6000 or both</p>

<p id="id03105" class="calibre1">s76E(a)—2 years, $12000 or both</p>

<p id="id03106" class="calibre1">Pointing to the last paragraph, Anthrax asked his lawyer what that was
all about. His lawyer told him that he would probably get prison but,
well, it wouldn't be that bad and he would just have `to take it on
the chin'. He would, after all, be out in a year or two.</p>

<p id="id03107" class="calibre1">Rapists sometimes got off with less than that. Anthrax couldn't
believe the prosecution was asking for prison. After he cooperated,
suffering through that miserable interview. He had no prior
convictions. But the snowball had been set in motion. The magistrate
appeared and opened the court.</p>

<p id="id03108" class="calibre1">Anthrax felt he couldn't back out now and he pleaded guilty to 21
counts, including one charge of inserting data and twenty charges of
defrauding or attempting to defraud a carrier.</p>

<p id="id03109" class="calibre1">His lawyer put the case for a lenient sentence. He called Anthrax's
father up on the stand and asked him questions about his son. His
father probably did more harm than good. When asked if he thought his
son would offend again, his father replied, `I don't know'.</p>

<p id="id03110" class="calibre1">Anthrax was livid. It was further unconscionable behaviour. Not long
before the trial, Anthrax had discovered that his father had planned
to sneak out of the country two days before the court case. He was
going overseas, he told his wife, but not until after the court case.
It was only by chance that she discovered his surreptitious plans to
leave early. Presumably he would find his son's trial humiliating.
Anthrax's mother insisted he stayed and he begrudgingly delayed the
trip.</p>

<p id="id03111" class="calibre1">His father sat down, a bit away from Anthrax and his lawyer. The
lawyer provided a colourful alternative to the prosecutor. He perched
one leg up on his bench, rested an elbow on the knee and stroked his
long, red beard. It was an impressive beard, more than a foot long and
thick with reddish brown curls. Somehow it fitted with his two-tone
chocolate brown suit and his tie, a breathtakingly wide creation with
wild patterns in gold. The suit was one size too small. He launched
into the usual courtroom flourish—lots of words saying nothing. Then
he got to the punch line.</p>

<p id="id03112" class="calibre1">`Your worship, this young man has been in all sorts of places. NASA,
military sites, you wouldn't believe some of the places he has been.'</p>

<p id="id03113" class="calibre1">`I don't think I want to know where he has been,' the magistrate
answered wryly.</p>

<p id="id03114" class="calibre1">The strategy was Anthrax's. He thought he could turn a
liability into an asset by showing that he had been in many
systems—many sensitive systems—but had done no malicious damage in
any of them.</p>

<p id="id03115" class="calibre1">The strategy worked and the magistrate announced there was no way he
was sending the young hacker to jail.</p>

<p id="id03116" class="calibre1">The prosecutor looked genuinely disappointed and launched a counter
proposal—1500 hours of community service. Anthrax caught his breath.
That was absurd. It would take almost nine months, full time. Painting
buildings, cleaning toilets. Forget about his university studies. It was
almost as bad as prison.</p>

<p id="id03117" class="calibre1">Anthrax's lawyer protested. `Your Worship, that penalty is something
out of cyberspace.' Anthrax winced at how corny that sounded, but the
lawyer looked very pleased with himself.</p>

<p id="id03118" class="calibre1">The magistrate refused to have a bar of the prosecutor's counter
proposal. Anthrax's girlfriend was impressed with the magistrate. She
didn't know much about the law or the court system, but he seemed a
fair man, a just man. He didn't appear to want to give a harsh
punishment to Anthrax at all. But he told the court he had to send a
message to Anthrax, to the class of school children in the public
benches and to the general community that hacking was wrong in the
eyes of the law. Anthrax glanced back at the students. They looked
like they were aged thirteen or fourteen, about the age he got into
hacking and phreaking.</p>

<p id="id03119" class="calibre1">The magistrate announced his sentence. Two hundred hours of community
service and $6116.90 of restitution to be paid to two telephone
companies—Telecom and Teleglobe in Canada. It wasn't prison, but it was
a staggering amount of money for a student to rake up. He had a year to
pay it off, and it would definitely take that long. At least he was
free.</p>

<p id="id03120" class="calibre1">Anthrax's girlfriend thought how unlucky it was to have landed those
giggling school children in the courtroom on that day. They laughed
and pointed and half-whispered. Court was a game. They didn't seem to
take the magistrate's warning seriously. Perhaps they were gossiping
about the next party. Perhaps they were chatting about a new pair of
sneakers or a new CD.</p>

<p id="id03121" class="calibre1">And maybe one or two murmured quietly how cool it would be to break
into NASA.</p>

<p id="id03122" class="calibre1">                                 Afterword.</p>

<p id="id03123" class="calibre2">It was billed as the `largest annual gathering of those in, related
to, or wishing to know more about the computer underground', so I
thought I had better go.</p>

<p id="id03124" class="calibre1">HoHoCon in Austin, Texas, was without a doubt one of the strangest
conferences I have attended. During the weekend leading up to New Year's
Day 1995, the Ramada Inn South was overrun by hackers, phreakers,
ex-hackers, underground sympathisers, journalists, computer company
employees and American law enforcement agents. Some people had come from
as far away as Germany and Canada.</p>

<p id="id03125" class="calibre1">The hackers and phreakers slept four or six to a room—if they slept
at all. The feds slept two to a room. I could be wrong; maybe they
weren't feds at all. But they seemed far too well dressed and well
pressed to be anything else. No one else at HoHoCon ironed their
T-shirts.</p>

<p id="id03126" class="calibre1">I left the main conference hall and wandered into Room 518—the
computer room—sat down on one of the two hotel beds which had been
shoved into a corner to make room for all the computer gear, and
watched. The conference organisers had moved enough equipment in there
to open a store, and then connected it all to the Internet. For nearly
three days, the room was almost continuously full. Boys in their late
teens or early twenties lounged on the floor talking, playing with
their cell phones and scanners or tapping away at one of the six or
seven terminals. Empty bags of chips, Coke cans and pizza boxes
littered the room. The place felt like one giant college dorm floor
party, except that the people didn't talk to each other so much as to
their computers.</p>

<p id="id03127" class="calibre1">These weren't the only interesting people at the con. I met up with an
older group of nonconformists in the computer industry, a sort of
Austin intelligentsia. By older, I mean above the age of 26. They were
interested in many of the same issues as the young group of
hackers—privacy, encryption, the future of a digital world—and they
all had technical backgrounds.</p>

<p id="id03128" class="calibre1">This loose group of blue-jean clad thinkers, people like Doug Barnes,
Jeremy Porter and Jim McCoy, like to meet over enchiladas and
margueritas at university-style cafes. They always seemed to have
three or four projects on the run. Digital cash was the flavour of the
month when I met them. They were unconventional, perhaps even a little
weird, but they were also bright, very creative and highly innovative.
They were just the sort of people who might marry creative ideas with
maturity and business sense, eventually making widespread digital cash
a reality.</p>

<p id="id03129" class="calibre1">I began to wonder how many of the young men in Room 518 might follow
the same path. And I asked myself: where are these people in
Australia?</p>

<p id="id03130" class="calibre1">Largely invisible or perhaps even non-existent, it seems. Except maybe
in the computer underground. The underground appears to be one of the
few places in Australia where madness, creativity, obsession,
addiction and rebellion collide like atoms in a cyclotron.</p>

<p id="id03131" class="calibre2">After the raids, the arrests and the court cases on three continents,
what became of the hackers described in this book?</p>

<p id="id03132" class="calibre1">Most of them went on to do interesting and constructive things with
their lives. Those who were interviewed for this work say they have
given up hacking for good. After what many of them had been through, I
would be surprised if any of them continued hacking.</p>

<p id="id03133" class="calibre1">Most of them, however, are not sorry for their hacking activities.
Some are sorry they upset people. They feel badly that they caused
system admins stress and unhappiness by hacking their systems. But
most do not feel hacking is wrong—and few, if any, feel that
`look-see hacking', as prosecuting barrister Geoff Chettle termed
non-malicious hacking, should be a crime.</p>

<p id="id03134" class="calibre1">For the most part, their punishments have only hardened their views on
the subject. They know that in many cases the authorities have sought
to make examples of them, for the benefit of rest of the computer
underground. The state has largely failed in this objective. In the
eyes of many in the computer underground, these prosecuted hackers are
heroes.</p>

<h5 id="id03135" class="calibre9">PAR</h5>

<p id="id03136" class="calibre1">When I met Par in Tucson, Arizona, he had travelled from a tiny,
snow-laden Mid-Western town where he was living with his grandparents.
He was looking for work, but hadn't been able to find anything.</p>

<p id="id03137" class="calibre1">As I drove around the outskirts of Tucson, a little jetlagged and
disoriented, I was often distracted from the road by the beauty of the
winter sun on the Sonoran desert cacti. Sitting in the front passenger
seat, Par said calmly, `I always wondered what it would be like to
drive on the wrong side of the road'.</p>

<p id="id03138" class="calibre1">I swerved back to the right side of the road.</p>

<p id="id03139" class="calibre1">Par is still like that. Easy-going, rolling with the punches, taking
what life hands him. He is also on the road again.</p>

<p id="id03140" class="calibre1">He moved back to the west coast for a while, but will likely pack up
and go somewhere else before long. He picks up temporary work where he
can, often just basic, dull data-entry stuff. It isn't easy. He can't
just explain away a four-year gap in his resumé with `Successfully
completed a telecommuting course for fugitives. Trained by the US
Secret Service'. He thought he might like to work at a local college
computer lab, helping out the students and generally keeping the
equipment running. Without any professional qualifications, that
seemed an unlikely option these days.</p>

<p id="id03141" class="calibre1">Although he is no longer a fugitive, Par's life hasn't changed that
much. He speaks to his mother very occasionally, though they don't
have much in common. Escaping his computer crimes charges proved
easier than overcoming the effects of being a fugitive for so long on
his personality and lifestyle. Now and again, the paranoia sets in
again. It seems to come in waves. There aren't many support mechanisms
in the US for an unemployed young man who doesn't have health
insurance.</p>

<h5 id="id03142" class="calibre9">PRIME SUSPECT</h5>

<p id="id03143" class="calibre1">Prime Suspect has no regrets about his choices. He believed that he
and Mendax were headed in different directions in life. The friendship
would have ended anyway, so he decided that he was not willing to go
to prison for Mendax.</p>

<p id="id03144" class="calibre1">He completed a TAFE course in computer programming and found a job in
the burgeoning Internet industry. He likes his job. His employer, who
knows about his hacking convictions, recently gave him a pay rise. In
mid-1994, he gave up drugs for good. In 1995 he moved into a shared
house with some friends, and in August 1996 he stopped smoking
cigarettes.</p>

<p id="id03145" class="calibre1">Without hacking, there seems to be time in his life to do new things.
He took up sky-diving. A single jump gives him a high which lasts for
days, sometimes up to a week. Girls have captured his interest. He's
had a few girlfriends and thinks he would like to settle into a
serious relationship when he finds the right person.</p>

<p id="id03146" class="calibre1">Recently, Prime Suspect has been studying martial arts. He tries to
attend at least four classes a week, sometimes more, and says he has a
special interest in the spiritual and philosophical sides of martial
arts. Most days, he rises at 5 a.m., either to jog or to meditate.</p>

<h5 id="id03147" class="calibre9">MENDAX</h5>

<p id="id03148" class="calibre1">In 1992 Mendax and Trax teamed up with a wealthy Italian real-estate
investor, purchased La Trobe University's mainframe computer
(ironically, a machine they had been accused of hacking) and started a
computer security company. The company eventually dissolved when the
investor disappeared following actions by his creditors.</p>

<p id="id03149" class="calibre1">After a public confrontation in 1993 with Victorian Premier Jeff
Kennett, Mendax and two others formed a civil rights organisation to
fight corruption and lack of accountability in a Victorian government
department. As part of this ongoing effort, Mendax acted as a conduit
for leaked documents and became involved in a number of court cases
against the department during 1993-94. Eventually, he gave evidence in
camera to a state parliamentary committee examining the issues, and
his organisation later facilitated the appearance of more than 40
witnesses at an investigation by the Auditor-General.</p>

<p id="id03150" class="calibre1">Mendax volunteers his time and computer expertise for several other
non-profit community organisations. He believes strongly in the
importance of the non-profit sector, and spends much of his free time
as an activist on different community projects. Mendax has provided
information or assistance to law-enforcement bodies, but not against
hackers. He said, `I couldn't ethically justify that. But as for
others, such as people who prey on children or corporate spies, I am
not concerned about using my skills there.'</p>

<p id="id03151" class="calibre1">Still passionate about coding, Mendax donates his time to various
international programming efforts and releases some of his programs
for free on the Internet. His philosophy is that most of the lasting
social advances in the history of man have been a direct result of new
technology.</p>

<p id="id03152" class="calibre1">NorTel and a number of other organisations he was accused of hacking
use his cryptography software—a fact he finds rather ironic.</p>

<h5 id="id03153" class="calibre9">ANTHRAX</h5>

<p id="id03154" class="calibre1">Anthrax moved to Melbourne, where he is completing a university course
and working on freelance assignments in the computer networking area
of a major corporation.</p>

<p id="id03155" class="calibre1">His father and mother are divorcing. Anthrax doesn't talk to his
father at all these days.</p>

<p id="id03156" class="calibre1">Anthrax's mother's health has stabilised somewhat since the completion
of the court case, though her condition still gives her chronic pain.
Despite some skin discolouration caused by the disease, she looks
well. As a result of her years of work in the local community, she has
a loyal group of friends who support her through bad bouts of the
illness. She tries to live without bitterness and continues to have a
good relationship with both her sons.</p>

<p id="id03157" class="calibre1">Anthrax is no longer involved in the Nation of Islam, but he is still
a devout Muslim. An acquaintance of his, an Albanian who ran a local
fish and chips shop, introduced him to a different kind of Islam. Not
long after, Anthrax became a Sunni Muslim. He doesn't drink alcohol or
gamble, and he attends a local mosque for Friday evening prayers. He
tries to read from the Qu'raan every day and to practise the tenets of
his religion faithfully.</p>

<p id="id03158" class="calibre1">With his computer and business skills now sought after by industry, he
is exploring the possibility of moving to a Muslim country in Asia or
the Middle East. He tries to promote the interests of Islam worldwide.</p>

<p id="id03159" class="calibre1">Most of his pranking needs are now met by commercial CDs—recordings<br class="calibre4"/>

of other people's pranking sold through underground magazines and<br class="calibre4"/>

American mail order catalogues. Once in a long while, he still rings<br class="calibre4"/>

Mr McKenny in search of the missing shovel.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id03160" class="calibre1">Anthrax felt aggrieved at the outcome of his written complaint to the
Office of the Ombudsman. In the complaint, Anthrax gave an account of
how he believed the AFP had behaved inappropriately throughout his
case. Specifically, he alleged that the AFP had pressured his mother
with threats and had harassed him, taken photographs of him without
his permission, given information to his university about his case
prior to the issue of a summons and the resolution of his case, and
made racist comments toward him during the raid.</p>

<p id="id03161" class="calibre1">In 1995-96, a total of 1157 complaints were filed against the AFP, 683
of which were investigated by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Of the
complaint investigations completed and reviewed, only 6 per cent were
substantiated. Another 9 per cent were deemed to be `incapable of
determination', about 34 per cent were `unsubstantiated', and in more
than a quarter of all cases the Ombudsman either chose not to
investigate or not to continue to investigate a complaint.</p>

<p id="id03162" class="calibre1">The Office of the Ombudsman referred Anthrax's matter to the AFP's
Internal Investigations office. Although Anthrax and his mother both
gave statements to the investigating officers, there was no other
proof of Anthrax's allegations. In the end, it came down to Anthrax
and his mother's words against those of the police.</p>

<p id="id03163" class="calibre1">The AFP's internal investigation concluded that Anthrax's complaints
could either not be substantiated or not be determined, in part due to
the fact that almost two years had passed since the original raid. For
the most part, the Ombudsman backed the AFP's finding. No
recommendation was made for the disciplining of any officers.</p>

<p id="id03164" class="calibre1">Anthrax's only consolation was a concern voiced by the Ombudsman's
Office. Although the investigating officer agreed with the AFP
investigators that the complaint could not be substantiated, she
wrote, `I am concerned that your mother felt she was compelled to
pressure you into attending an interview based on a fear that she
would be charged because her phone was used to perpetrate the
offences'.</p>

<p id="id03165" class="calibre1">Anthrax remains angry and sceptical about his experience with the
police. He believes a lot of things need to be changed about the way
the police operate. Most of all, he believes that justice will never
be assured in a system where the police are allowed to investigate
themselves.</p>

<h5 id="id03166" class="calibre9">PAD AND GANDALF</h5>

<p id="id03167" class="calibre1">After Pad and Gandalf were released from prison, they started up a
free security advisory service on the Internet. One reason they began
releasing 8lgm advisories, as they were known, was to help admins
secure their own systems. The other reason was to thumb their noses at
the conservatives in the security industry.</p>

<p id="id03168" class="calibre1">Many on the Internet considered the 8lgm advisories to be the best
available at the time—far better than anything CERT had ever
produced. Pad and Gandalf were sending their own message back to the
establishment. The message, though never openly stated, was something
like this: `You busted us. You sent us to prison. But it didn't
matter. You can't keep information like this secret. Further, we are
still better than you ever were and, to prove it, we are going to beat
you at your own game.'</p>

<p id="id03169" class="calibre1">Believing that the best way to keep a hacker out of your system is to
secure it properly in the first place, the two British hackers
rejected security gurus who refused to tell the world about new
security holes. Their 8lgm advisories began marginalising the
traditional industry security reports, and helped to push the industry
toward its current, more open attitude.</p>

<p id="id03170" class="calibre1">Pad and Gandalf now both work, doing computer programming jobs on
contract, sometimes for financial institutions. Their clients like
them and value their work. Both have steady girlfriends.</p>

<p id="id03171" class="calibre1">Pad doesn't hack any more. The reason isn't the risk of getting caught
or the threat of prison. He has stopped hacking because he has
realised what a headache it is for a system administrator to clean up
his or her computer after an attack. Searching through logs. Looking
for backdoors the hacker might have left behind. The hours, the
hassle, the pressure—he thinks it is wrong to put anyone through
that. Pad understands far better now how much strain a hacker
intrusion can cause another human being.</p>

<p id="id03172" class="calibre1">There is another reason Pad has given up hacking: he has simply
outgrown the desire. He says that he has better things to do with his
time. Computers are a way for him to earn a living, not a way to spend
his leisure time. After a trip overseas he decided that real
travel—not its electronic cousin—was more interesting than hacking.
He has also learned to play the guitar, something he believes he would
have done years ago if he hadn't spent so much time hacking.</p>

<p id="id03173" class="calibre1">Gandalf shares Pad's interest in travelling. One reason they like
contract work is because it lets them work hard for six months, save
some money, and then take a few months off. The aim of both ex-hackers
for now is simply to sling backpacks over their shoulders and bounce
around the globe.</p>

<p id="id03174" class="calibre1">Pad still thinks that Britain takes hacking far too seriously and he
is considering moving overseas permanently. The 8lgm court case made
him wonder about the people in power in Britain—the politicians, the
judges, the law enforcement officers. He often thinks: what kind of
people are running this show?</p>

<h5 id="id03175" class="calibre9">STUART GILL</h5>

<p id="id03176" class="calibre1">In 1993, the Victorian Ombudsman1 and the Victoria Police2 both
investigated the leaking of confidential police information in
association with Operation Iceberg—a police investigation into
allegations of corruption against Assistant Commissioner of Police
Frank Green. Stuart Gill figured prominently in both reports.</p>

<p id="id03177" class="calibre1">The Victoria Police report concluded that `Gill was able to infiltrate
the policing environment by skilfully manipulating himself and
information to the unsuspecting'. The Ombudsman concluded that a
`large quantity of confidential police information, mainly from the
ISU database, was given to … Gill by [Victoria Police officer]
Cosgriff'.</p>

<p id="id03178" class="calibre1">The police report stated that Inspector Chris Cosgriff had
deliberately leaked confidential police information to Gill, and
reported that he was `besotted with Gill'. Superintendent Tony Warren,
ex-Deputy Commissioner John Frame and ex-Assistant Commissioner
Bernice Masterston were also criticised in the report.</p>

<p id="id03179" class="calibre1">The Ombudsman concluded that Warren and Cosgriff's relationship with
Gill was `primarily responsible for the release of confidential
information'. Interestingly, however, the Ombudsman also stated,
`Whilst Mr Gill may have had his own agenda and taken advantage of his
relationship with police, [the] police have equally used and in some
cases misused Mr Gill for their own purposes'.</p>

<p id="id03180" class="calibre1">The Ombudsman's report further concluded that there was no evidence of
criminal conduct by Frank Green, and that the `allegations made over
the years against Mr Green should have been properly and fully
investigated at the time they were made'.</p>

<h5 id="id03181" class="calibre9">PHOENIX</h5>

<p id="id03182" class="calibre1">As his court case played in the media, Phoenix was speeding on his
motorcycle through an inner-city Melbourne street one rainy night when
he hit a car. The car's driver leapt from the front seat and found a
disturbing scene. Phoenix was sprawled across the road. His helmet had
a huge crack on the side, where his head had hit the car's petrol
tank, and petrol had spilled over the motorcycle and its rider.</p>

<p id="id03183" class="calibre1">Miraculously, Phoenix was unhurt, though very dazed. Some bystanders
helped him and the distraught driver to a nearby halfway house. They
called an ambulance, and then made the two traumatised young men some
tea in the kitchen. Phoenix's mother arrived, called by a bystander at
Phoenix's request. The ambulance workers confirmed that Phoenix had
not broken any bones but they recommended he go to hospital to check
for possible concussion.</p>

<p id="id03184" class="calibre1">Still both badly shaken, Phoenix and the driver exchanged names and
phone numbers. Phoenix told the driver he did technical work for a
0055 telephone service, then said, `You might recognise me. I'm
Phoenix. There's this big computer hacking case going on in
court—that's my case'.</p>

<p id="id03185" class="calibre1">The driver looked at him blankly.</p>

<p id="id03186" class="calibre1">Phoenix said, `You might have seen me on the TV news.'</p>

<p id="id03187" class="calibre1">No, the driver said, somewhat amazed at the strange things which go
through the dazed mind of a young man who has so narrowly escaped
death.</p>

<p id="id03188" class="calibre1">Some time after Phoenix's close brush with death, the former hacker
left his info-line technician's job and began working in the
information technology division of a large Melbourne-based
corporation. Well paid in his new job, Phoenix is seen, once again, as
the golden-haired boy. He helped to write a software program which
reduces waste in one of the production lines and reportedly saved the
company thousands of dollars. Now he travels abroad regularly, to
Japan and elsewhere.</p>

<p id="id03189" class="calibre1">He had a steady girlfriend for a time, but eventually she broke the
relationship off to see other people. Heartbroken, he avoided dating
for months. Instead, he filled his time with his ever-increasing
corporate responsibilities.</p>

<p id="id03190" class="calibre1">His new interest is music. He plays electric guitar in an amateur
band.</p>

<h5 id="id03191" class="calibre9">ELECTRON</h5>

<p id="id03192" class="calibre1">A few weeks after his sentencing, Electron had another psychotic
episode, triggered by a dose of speed. He was admitted to hospital
again, this time at Larundel. After a short stay, he was released and
underwent further psychiatric care.</p>

<p id="id03193" class="calibre1">Some months later, he did speed again, and suffered another bout of
psychosis. He kept reading medical papers on the Internet about his
condition and his psychiatrists worried that his detailed research
might interfere with their ability to treat him.</p>

<p id="id03194" class="calibre1">He moved into special accommodation for people recovering from mental
instabilities. Slowly, he struggled to overcome his illness. When
people came up to him and said things like, `What a nice day it is!'
Electron willed himself to take their words at face value, to accept
that they really were just commenting on the weather, nothing more.
During this time, he quit drugs, alcohol and his much-hated accounting
course. Eventually he was able to come off his psychiatric medicines
completely. He hasn't taken drugs or had alcohol since December 1994.
His only chemical vice in 1996 was cigarettes. By the beginning of
1997 he had also given up tobacco.</p>

<p id="id03195" class="calibre1">Electron hasn't talked to either Phoenix or Nom since 1992.</p>

<p id="id03196" class="calibre1">In early 1996, Electron moved into his own flat with his steady
girlfriend, who studies dance and who also successfully overcame
mental illness after a long, hard struggle. Electron began another
university course in a philosophy-related field. This time university
life agreed with him, and his first semester transcript showed honours
grades in every class. He is considering moving to Sydney for further
studies.</p>

<p id="id03197" class="calibre1">Electron worked off his 300 hours of community service by painting walls
and doing minor handyman work at a local primary school. Among the small
projects the school asked him to complete was the construction of a
retaining wall. He designed and dug, measured and fortified. As he
finished off the last of his court-ordered community service hours on
the wall, he discovered that he was rather proud of his creation. Even
now, once in a while, he drives past the school and looks at the wall.</p>

<p id="id03198" class="calibre1">It is still standing.</p>

<p id="id03199" class="calibre2">There are still hacking cases in Australia. About the same time as
Mendax's case was being heard in Victoria, The Crawler pleaded guilty
to 23 indictable offences and thirteen summary offences—all hacking
related charges—in Brisbane District Court. On 20 December 1996, the
21-year-old Queenslander was given a three-year suspended prison
sentence, ordered to pay $5000 in reparations to various
organisations, and made to forfeit his modem and two computers. The
first few waves of hackers may have come and gone, but hacking is far
from dead. It is merely less visible.</p>

<p id="id03200" class="calibre1">Law enforcement agencies and the judiciaries of several countries have
tried to send a message to the next generation of would-be hackers.
The message is this: Don't hack.</p>

<p id="id03201" class="calibre1">But the next generation of elite hackers and phreakers have heard a
very different message, a message which says: Don't get caught.</p>

<p id="id03202" class="calibre1">The principle of deterrence has not worked with hackers at this level.
I'm not talking here about the codes-kids—the teeny-bopper, carding,
wanna-be nappies who hang out on IRC (Internet relay chat). I'm
talking about the elite hackers. If anything, law enforcement
crackdowns have not only pushed them further underground, they have
encouraged hackers to become more sophisticated than ever before in
the way they protect themselves. Adversity is the mother of invention.</p>

<p id="id03203" class="calibre1">When police officers march through the front door of a hacker's home
today, they may be better prepared than their predecessors, but they
will also be facing bigger hurdles.  Today, top hackers encrypt
everything sensitive. The data on their hard drives, their live data
connections, even their voice conversations.</p>

<p id="id03204" class="calibre1">So, if hackers are still hacking, who are their targets?</p>

<p id="id03205" class="calibre1">It is a broad field. Any type of network provider—X.25, cellular
phone or large Internet provider. Computer vendors—the manufacturers
of software and hardware, routers, gateways, firewalls or phone
switches. Military institutions, governments and banks seem to be a
little less fashionable these days, though there are still plenty of
attacks on these sorts of sites.</p>

<p id="id03206" class="calibre1">Attacks on security experts are still common, but a new trend is the
increase in attacks on other hackers' systems. One Australian hacker
joked, `What are the other hackers going to do? Call the Feds? Tell
the AFP, "Yes, officer, that's right, some computer criminal broke
into my machine and stole 20000 passwords and all my exploitation code
for bypassing firewalls".'</p>

<p id="id03207" class="calibre1">For the most part, elite hackers seem to work alone, because of the
well-advertised risks of getting caught. There are still some
underground hacking communities frequented by top hackers, most notably
UPT in Canada and a few groups like the l0pht in the US, but such groups
are far less common, and more fragmented than they used to be.</p>

<p id="id03208" class="calibre1">These hackers have reached a new level of sophistication, not just in
the technical nature of their attacks, but in their strategies and
objectives. Once, top hackers such as Electron and Phoenix were happy
to get copies of Zardoz, which listed security holes found by industry
experts. Now top hackers find those holes themselves—by reading line
by line through the proprietary source code from places like DEC, HP,
CISCO, Sun and Microsoft.</p>

<p id="id03209" class="calibre1">Industrial espionage does not seem to be on the agenda, at least with
anyone I interviewed. I have yet to meet a hacker who has given
proprietary source code to a vendor's competitor. I have, however, met
a hacker who found one company's proprietary source code inside the
computer of its competitor. Was that a legal copy of the source code?
Who knows? The hacker didn't think so, but he kept his mouth shut
about it, for obvious reasons.</p>

<p id="id03210" class="calibre1">Most of the time, these hackers want to keep their original bugs as
quiet as possible, so vendors won't release patches.</p>

<p id="id03211" class="calibre1">The second popular target is source code development machines. The top
hackers have a clear objective in this area: to install their own
backdoors before the product is released. They call it `backdooring' a
program or an operating system. The word `backdoor' is now used as
both a noun and a verb in the underground. Hackers are very nervous
discussing this subject, in part because they don't want to see a
computer company's stock dive and people lose their jobs.</p>

<p id="id03212" class="calibre1">What kind of programs do these hackers want to backdoor? Targets
mentioned include at least one major Internet browser, a popular game,
an Internet packet filter and a database product used by law
enforcement agencies.</p>

<p id="id03213" class="calibre1">A good backdoor is a very powerful device, creating a covert channel
through even the most sturdy of firewalls into the heart of an
otherwise secure network. In a net browser, a backdoor would in theory
allow a hacker to connect directly into someone's home computer every
time he or she wandered around the World Wide Web. However, don't
expect hackers to invade your suburban home just yet. Most elite
hackers couldn't care less about the average person's home computer.</p>

<p id="id03214" class="calibre1">Perhaps you are wondering who might be behind this sort of attack.
What sort of person would do this? There are no easy answers to that
question. Some hackers are good people, some are bad, just like any
group of people. The next generation of elite hackers are a diverse
bunch, and relaying their stories would take another book entirely.
However, I would like to introduce you to just one, to give you a
window into the future.</p>

<p id="id03215" class="calibre1">Meet SKiMo.</p>

<p id="id03216" class="calibre1">A European living outside Australia, SKiMo has been hacking for at
least four years, although he probably only joined the ranks of
world-class hackers in 1995 or 1996. Never busted. Young—between the
age of 18 and 25—and male. From a less than picture-perfect family.
Fluent in English as a second language. Left-leaning in his
politics—heading toward environmentally green parties and anarchy
rather than traditional labour parties. Smokes a little dope and
drinks alcohol, but doesn't touch the hard stuff.</p>

<p id="id03217" class="calibre1">His musical tastes include early Pink Floyd, Sullen, Dog Eat Dog,<br class="calibre4"/>

Biohazard, old Ice-T, Therapy, Alanis Morissette, Rage Against the<br class="calibre4"/>

Machine, Fear Factory, Life of Agony and Napalm Death. He reads<br class="calibre4"/>

Stephen King, Stephen Hawking, Tom Clancy and Aldous Huxley. And any<br class="calibre4"/>

good books about physics, chemistry or mathematics.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id03218" class="calibre1">Shy in person, he doesn't like organised team sports and is not very
confident around girls. He has only had one serious girlfriend, but
the relationship finished. Now that he hacks and codes about four to
five hours per day on average, but sometimes up to 36 hours straight,
he doesn't have time for girls.</p>

<p id="id03219" class="calibre1">`Besides,' he says, `I am rather picky when it comes to girls. Maybe
if the girl shared the same interests … but those ones are hard to
find.' He adds, by way of further explanation, `Girls are different
from hacking. You can't just brute force them if all else fails.'</p>

<p id="id03220" class="calibre1">SKiMo has never intentionally damaged a computer system, nor would he.
Indeed, when I asked him, he was almost offended by the question.
However, he has accidentally done damage on a few occasions. In at
least one case, he returned to the system and fixed the problem
himself.</p>

<p id="id03221" class="calibre1">Bored out of his mind for most of his school career, SKiMo spent a
great deal of time reading books in class—openly. He wanted to send
the teacher a message without actually jacking up in class.</p>

<p id="id03222" class="calibre1">He got into hacking after reading a magazine article about people who
hacked answering machines and VMBs. At that time, he had no idea what
a VMB was, but he learned fast. One Sunday evening, he sat down with
his phone and began scanning. Soon he was into phreaking, and visiting
English-speaking party lines. Somehow, he always felt more comfortable
speaking in English, to native English-speakers, perhaps because he
felt a little like an outsider in his own culture.</p>

<p id="id03223" class="calibre1">`I have always had the thought to leave my country as soon as I can,'
he said.</p>

<p id="id03224" class="calibre1">From the phreaking, it was a short jump into hacking.</p>

<p id="id03225" class="calibre1">What made him want to hack or phreak in the first place? Maybe it was
the desire to screw over the universally hated phone company, or
`possibly the sheer lust for power' or then again, maybe he was simply
answering his desire `to explore an intricate piece of technology'.
Today, however, he is a little clearer on why he continues to hack.
`My first and foremost motivation is to learn,' he said.</p>

<p id="id03226" class="calibre1">When asked why he doesn't visit his local university or library to
satisfy that desire, he answered, `in books, you only learn theory. It
is not that I dislike the theory but computer security in real life is
much different from theory'. Libraries also have trouble keeping pace
with the rate of technological change, SKiMo said. `Possibly, it is
also just the satisfaction of knowing that what I learn is
proprietary—is "inside knowledge",' he added. There could, he said,
be some truth in the statement that he likes learning in an
adrenalin-inducing environment.</p>

<p id="id03227" class="calibre1">Is he addicted to computers? SKiMo says no, but the indications are
there. By his own estimate, he has hacked between 3000 and 10000
computers in total. His parents—who have no idea what their son was
up to day and night on his computer—worry about his behaviour. They
pulled the plug on his machine many times. In SKiMo's own words, `they
tried everything to keep me away from it'.</p>

<p id="id03228" class="calibre1">Not surprisingly, they failed. SKiMo became a master at hiding his
equipment so they couldn't sneak in and take it away. Finally, when he
got sick of battling them over it and he was old enough, he put his
foot down. `I basically told them, "Diz is ma fuckin' life and none o'
yer business, Nemo"—but not in those words.'</p>

<p id="id03229" class="calibre1">SKiMo says he hasn't suffered from any mental illnesses or
instabilities—except perhaps paranoia. But he says that paranoia is
justified in his case. In two separate incidents in 1996, he believed
he was being followed. Try as he might, he couldn't shake the tails
for quite some time. Perhaps it was just a coincidence, but he can
never really be sure.</p>

<p id="id03230" class="calibre1">He described one hacking attack to me to illustrate his current
interests. He managed to get inside the internal network of a German
mobile phone network provider, DeTeMobil (Deutsche Telekom). A former
state-owned enterprise which was transformed into a publicly listed
corporation in January 1995, Deutsche Telekom is the largest
telecommunications company in Europe and ranks number three in the
world as a network operator. It employs almost a quarter of a million
people. By revenue, which totalled about $A37 billion in 1995, it is
one of the five largest companies in Germany.</p>

<p id="id03231" class="calibre1">After carefully researching and probing a site, SKiMo unearthed a
method of capturing the encryption keys generated for DeTeMobil's
mobile phone conversations.</p>

<p id="id03232" class="calibre1">He explained: `The keys are not fixed, in the sense that they are
generated once and then stored in some database. Rather, a key is
generated for each phone conversation by the company's AUC
[authentication centre], using the "Ki" and a random value generated
by the AUC. The Ki is the secret key that is securely stored on the
smart card [inside the cellphone], and a copy is also stored in the
AUC. When the AUC "tells" the cellphone the key for that particular
conversation, the information passes through the company's MSC [mobile
switching centre].</p>

<p id="id03233" class="calibre1">`It is possible to eavesdrop on a certain cellphone if one actively
monitors either the handovers or the connection set-up messages from
the OMC [operations and maintenance centre] or if one knows the Ki in
the smart card.</p>

<p id="id03234" class="calibre1">`Both options are entirely possible. The first option, which relies on
knowing the A5 encryption key, requires the right equipment. The
second option, using the Ki, means you have to know the A3/A8
algorithms as well or the Ki is useless. These algorithms can be
obtained by hacking the switch manufacturer, i.e. Siemens, Alcatel,
Motorola …</p>

<p id="id03235" class="calibre1">`As a call is made from the target cellphone, you need to feed the A5
key into a cellphone which has been modified to let it eavesdrop on
the channel used by the cellphone. Normally, this eavesdropping will
only produce static—since the conversation is encrypted. However,
with the keys and equipment, you can decode the conversation.'</p>

<p id="id03236" class="calibre1">This is one of the handover messages, logged with a CCITT7 link
monitor, that he saw:</p>
