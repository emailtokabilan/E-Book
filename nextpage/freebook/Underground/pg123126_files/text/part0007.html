    On the issue of Electron's problems with the police, however,
Electron's father maintained a hands-off approach. Electron had only
talked to his father about his hacking exploits occasionally, usually
when he had achieved what he considered to be a very noteworthy hack.
His father's view was always the same. Hacking is illegal, he told his
son, and the police will probably eventually catch you. Then you will
have to deal with the problem yourself. He didn't lecture his son, or
forbid Electron from hacking. On this issue he considered his son old
enough to make his own choices and live with the consequences.</p>

<p id="id01779" class="calibre1">True to his word, Electron's father had shown little sympathy for his
son's legal predicament after the police raid. He remained neutral on
the subject, saying only, `I told you something like this would happen
and now it is your responsibility'.</p>

<p id="id01780" class="calibre1">Electron's hacking case progressed slowly over the year, as did his
university accounting studies. In March 1991, he faced committal
proceedings and had to decide whether to fight his committal.</p>

<p id="id01781" class="calibre1">He faced fifteen charges, most of which were for obtaining
unauthorised access to computers in the US and Australia. A few were
aggravated offences, for obtaining access to data of a commercial
nature. On one count each, the DPP (the Office of the Commonwealth
Director of Public Prosecutions) said he altered and erased data.
Those two counts were the result of his inserting backdoors for
himself, not because he did damage to any files. The evidence was
reasonably strong: telephone intercepts and datataps on Phoenix's
phone which showed him talking to Electron about hacking; logs of
Electron's own sessions in Melbourne University's systems which were
traced back to his home phone; and Electron's own confession to the
police.</p>

<p id="id01782" class="calibre1">This was the first major computer hacking case in Australia under the
new legislation. It was a test case—the test case for computer
hacking in Australia—and the DPP was going in hard. The case had
generated seventeen volumes of evidence, totalling some 25000 pages,
and Crown prosecutor Lisa West planned to call up to twenty expert
witnesses from Australia, Europe and the US.</p>

<p id="id01783" class="calibre1">Those witnesses had some tales to tell about the Australian hackers,
who had caused havoc in systems around the world. Phoenix had
accidentally deleted a Texas-based company's inventory of assets—the
only copy in existence according to Execucom Systems Corporation. The
hackers had also baffled security personnel at the US Naval Research
Labs. They had bragged to the New York Times. And they forced NASA to
cut off its computer network for 24 hours.</p>

<p id="id01784" class="calibre1">AFP Detective Sergeant Ken Day had flown halfway around the world to
obtain a witness statement from none other than NASA Langley computer
manager Sharon Beskenis—the admin Phoenix had accidentally kicked off
her own system when he was trying to get Deszip. Beskenis had been
more than happy to oblige and on 24 July 1990 she signed a statement
in Virginia, witnessed by Day. Her statement said that, as a result of
the hackers' intrusion, `the entire NASA computer system was
disconnected from any external communications with the rest of the
world' for about 24 hours on 22 February 1990.</p>

<p id="id01785" class="calibre1">In short, Electron thought, there didn't seem to be much chance of
winning at the committal hearing. Nom seemed to feel the same way. He
faced two counts, both `knowingly concerned' with Phoenix obtaining
unauthorised access. One was for NASA Langley, the other for
CSIRO—the Zardoz file. Nom didn't fight his committal either,
although Legal Aid's refusal
to fund a lawyer for the procedure no doubt weighed in his
decision.</p>

<p id="id01786" class="calibre1">On 6 March 1991, Magistrate Robert Langton committed Electron and Nom
to stand trial in the Victorian County Court.</p>

<p id="id01787" class="calibre1">Phoenix, however, didn't agree with his fellow hackers' point of view.
With financial help from his family, he had decided to fight his
committal. He wasn't going to hand this case to the prosecution on a
silver platter, and they would have to fight him every step of the
way, dragging him forward from proceeding to proceeding. His
barrister, Felicity Hampel, argued the court should throw out 47 of
the 48 charges against her client on jurisdictional grounds. All but
one charge—breaking into the CSIRO machine in order to steal
Zardoz—related to hacking activities outside Australia. How could an
Australian court claim jurisdiction over a hacked computer in Texas?</p>

<p id="id01788" class="calibre1">Privately, Phoenix worried more about being extradited to the US than
dealing with the Australian courts, but publicly he was going into the
committal with all guns blazing. It was a test case in many ways; not
only the first major hacking case in Australia but also the first time
a hacker had fought Australian committal proceedings for computer
crimes.</p>

<p id="id01789" class="calibre1">The prosecution agreed to drop one of the 48 counts, noting it was a
duplicate charge, but the backdown was a pyrrhic victory for Phoenix.
After a two-day committal hearing, Magistrate John Wilkinson decided
Hampel's jurisdictional argument didn't hold water and on 14 August
1991 he committed Phoenix to stand trial in the County Court.</p>

<p id="id01790" class="calibre1">By the day of Electron's committal, in March, Electron's father had
begun his final decline. The bowel cancer created a roller-coaster of
good and bad days, but soon there were only bad days, and they were
getting worse. On the last day of March, the doctors told him that it
was finally time to make the trip to hospital. He stubbornly refused
to go, fighting their advice, questioning their authority. They
quietly urged him again. He protested. Finally, they insisted.</p>

<p id="id01791" class="calibre1">Electron and his sister stayed with their father for hours that day,
and the following one. Their father had other visitors to keep his
spirits up, including his brother who fervently beseeched him to
accept Jesus Christ as his personal saviour before he died. That way,
he wouldn't burn in hell. Electron looked at his uncle, disbelieving.
He couldn't believe his father was having to put up with such crap on
his deathbed. Still, Electron chose to be discreet. Apart from an
occasional rolling of the eyes, he kept his peace at his father's
bedside.</p>

<p id="id01792" class="calibre1">Perhaps, however, the fervent words did some good, for as Electron's
father spoke about the funeral arrangements, he made a strange slip of
the tongue. He said `wedding' instead of funeral, then paused,
realising his mistake. Glancing slowly down at the intricate braided
silver wedding band still on his finger, he smiled frailly and said,
`I suppose, in a way, it will be like a wedding'.</p>

<p id="id01793" class="calibre1">Electron and his sister went to hospital every day for four days, to
sit by their father's bed.</p>

<p id="id01794" class="calibre1">At 6 a.m. on the fifth day, the telephone rang. It was the family
friend their father had asked to watch over them. Their father's life
signs were very, very weak, fluttering on the edge of death.</p>

<p id="id01795" class="calibre1">When Electron and his sister arrived at the hospital, the nurse's face
said everything. They were too late. Their father had died ten minutes
before they arrived. Electron broke down and wept. He hugged his
sister, who, for a brief moment, seemed almost reachable. Driving them
back to the house, the family friend stopped and bought them an
answering machine.</p>

<p id="id01796" class="calibre1">`You'll need this when everyone starts calling in,' she told them.<br class="calibre4"/>

`You might not want to talk to anyone for a while.'<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01797" class="calibre1">In the months after his bust in 1990 Electron began smoking marijuana
regularly. At first, as with many other university students, it was a
social thing. Some friends dropped by, they happened to have a few
joints, and so everybody went out for a night on the town. When he was
in serious hacking mode, he never smoked. A clear head was much too
important. Besides, the high he got from hacking was a hundred times
better than anything dope could ever do for him.</p>

<p id="id01798" class="calibre1">When Phoenix appeared on the front page of the New York Times,
Electron gave up hacking. And even if he had been tempted to return to
it, he didn't have anything to hack with after the police took his
only computer. Electron found himself casting around for something to
distract him from his father's deteriorating condition and the void
left by giving up hacking. His accounting studies didn't quite fit the
bill. They had always seemed empty, but never more so than now.</p>

<p id="id01799" class="calibre1">Smoking pot filled the void. So did tripping. Filled it very nicely.
Besides, he told himself, it's harder to get caught smoking dope in
your friends' houses than hacking in your own. The habit grew
gradually. Soon, he was smoking dope at home. New friends began coming
around, and they seemed to have drugs with them all the time—not just
occasionally, and not just for fun.</p>

<p id="id01800" class="calibre1">Electron and his sister had been left the family home and enough money
to give them a modest income. Electron began spending this money on
his new-found hobby. A couple of Electron's new friends moved into the
house for a few months. His sister didn't like them dealing drugs out
of the place, but Electron didn't care what was happening around him.
He just sat in his room, listening to his stereo, smoking dope,
dropping acid and watching the walls.</p>

<p id="id01801" class="calibre1">The headphones blocked out everyone in the house, and, more
importantly, what was going on inside Electron's own head. Billy
Bragg. Faith No More. Cosmic Psychos. Celibate Rifles. Jane's
Addiction. The Sex Pistols. The Ramones. Music gave Electron a
pinpoint, a figurative dot of light on his forehead where he could
focus his mind. Blot out the increasingly strange thoughts creeping
through his consciousness.</p>

<p id="id01802" class="calibre1">His father was alive. He was sure of it. He knew it, like he knew the
sun would rise tomorrow. Yet he had seen his father lying, dead, in
the hospital bed. It didn't make sense.</p>

<p id="id01803" class="calibre1">So he took another hit from the bong, floated in slow motion to his
bed, lay down, carefully slid the earphones over his head, closed his
eyes and tried to concentrate on what the Red Hot Chilli Peppers were
saying instead. When that wasn't enough, he ventured down the hallway,
down to his new friends—the friends with the acid tabs. Then, eight
more hours without having to worry about the strange thoughts.</p>

<p id="id01804" class="calibre1">Soon people began acting strangely too. They would tell Electron
things, but he had trouble understanding them. Pulling a milk carton
from the fridge and sniffing it, Electron's sister might say, `Milk's
gone off'. But Electron wasn't sure what she meant. He would look at
her warily. Maybe she was trying to tell him something else, about
spiders. Milking spiders for venom.</p>

<p id="id01805" class="calibre1">When thoughts like these wafted through Electron's mind, they
disturbed him, lingering like a sour smell. So he floated back to the
safety of his room and listened to songs by Henry Rollins.</p>

<p id="id01806" class="calibre1">After several months in this cloudy state of limbo, Electron awoke one
day to find the Crisis Assessment Team—a mobile psychiatric team—in
his bedroom. They asked him questions, then they tried to feed him
little blue tablets. Electron didn't want to take the tablets. Were
little blue pills placebos? He was sure they were. Or maybe they were
something more sinister.</p>

<p id="id01807" class="calibre1">Finally, the CAT workers convinced Electron to take the Stelazine
tablet. But when they left, terrifying things began to happen.
Electron's eyes rolled uncontrollably to the back of his head. His
head twisted to the left. His mouth dropped open, very wide. Try as he
might, he couldn't shut it, any more than he could turn his head
straight. Electron saw himself in the mirror and he panicked. He
looked like a character out of a horror
picture.</p>

<p id="id01808" class="calibre1">His new house-mates reacted to this strange new behaviour by trying to
psychoanalyse Electron, which was less than helpful. They discussed
him as if he wasn't even present. He felt like a ghost and, agitated
and confused, he began telling his friends that he was going to kill
himself. Someone called the CAT team again. This time they refused to
leave unless he would guarantee not to attempt suicide.</p>

<p id="id01809" class="calibre1">Electron refused. So they had him committed.</p>

<p id="id01810" class="calibre1">Inside the locked psychiatric ward of Plenty Hospital (now known as
NEMPS), Electron believed that, although he had gone crazy, he wasn't
really in a hospital psychiatric ward. The place was just supposed to
look like one. His father had set it
all up.</p>

<p id="id01811" class="calibre1">Electron refused to believe anything that anyone told him. It was all
lies. They said one thing, but always meant another.</p>

<p id="id01812" class="calibre1">He had proof. Electron read a list of patients' names on the wall and
found one called Tanas. That name had a special meaning. It was an
anagram for the word `Santa'. But Santa Claus was a myth, so the name
Tanas appearing on the hospital list proved to him that he shouldn't
listen to anything anyone told him.</p>

<p id="id01813" class="calibre1">Electron ate his meals mostly in silence, trying to ignore the
voluntary and involuntary patients who shared the dining hall. One
lunchtime, a stranger sat down at Electron's table and started talking
to him. Electron found it excruciatingly painful talking to other
people, and he kept wishing the stranger would go away.</p>

<p id="id01814" class="calibre1">The stranger talked about how good the drugs were in
hospital.</p>

<p id="id01815" class="calibre1">`Mm,' Electron said. `I used to do a lot of drugs.'</p>

<p id="id01816" class="calibre1">`How much is a lot?'</p>

<p id="id01817" class="calibre1">`I spent $28000 on dope alone in about four months.'</p>

<p id="id01818" class="calibre1">`Wow,' the stranger said, impressed. `Of course, you don't have to pay
for drugs. You can always get them for free. I do.'</p>

<p id="id01819" class="calibre1">`You do?' Electron asked, somewhat perplexed.</p>

<p id="id01820" class="calibre1">`Sure! All the time,' the stranger said grandly. `No problem. Just
watch.'</p>

<p id="id01821" class="calibre1">The stranger calmly put his fork down on the tray, carefully stood up
and then began yelling at the top of his lungs. He waved his arms
around frantically and shouted abuse at the other patients.</p>

<p id="id01822" class="calibre1">Two nurses came running from the observation room. One of them tried
to calm the stranger down while the other quickly measured out various
pills and grabbed a cup of water. The stranger swallowed the pills,
chased them with a swig of water and sat down quietly. The nurses
retreated, glancing back over their shoulders.</p>

<p id="id01823" class="calibre1">`See?' The stranger said. `Well, I'd better be on my way, before the
pills kick in. See ya.'</p>

<p id="id01824" class="calibre1">Electron watched, amazed, as the stranger picked up his bag, walked
through the dining-hall door, and straight out the front door of the
psychiatric ward.</p>

<p id="id01825" class="calibre1">After a month, the psychiatrists reluctantly allowed Electron to leave
the hospital in order to stay with his maternal grandmother in
Queensland. He was required to see a psychiatrist regularly. He spent
his first few days in Queensland believing he was Jesus Christ. But he
didn't hold onto that one for long. After two weeks of patiently
waiting and checking for signs of the imminent apocalypse, consistent
with the second coming, he decided he was really the reincarnation of
Buddha.</p>

<p id="id01826" class="calibre1">In late February 1992, after three months of psychiatric care up
north, Electron returned to Melbourne and his university studies, with
a bag full of medication. Prozac, major tranquillisers, Lithium. The
daily routine went smoothly for a while. Six Prozac—two in the
morning, two at midday and two at night. Another anti-depressant to be
taken at night. Also at night, the anti-side effect tablets to combat
the involuntary eye-rolling, jaw-dropping and neck-twisting associated
with the anti-depressants.</p>

<p id="id01827" class="calibre1">All of it was designed to help him deal with what had by
now become a long list of diagnoses. Cannabis psychosis.
Schizophrenia. Manic depression. Unipolar effective disorder.
Schizophrenaform. Amphetamine psychosis. Major effective disorder.
Atypical psychosis. And his own personal favourite—facticious
disorder, or faking it to get into hospital. But the medication wasn't
helping much. Electron still felt wretched, and returning to a host of
problems in Melbourne made things worse.</p>

<p id="id01828" class="calibre1">Because of his illness, Electron had been largely out of the loop of
legal proceedings. Sunny Queensland provided a welcome escape. Now he
was back in Victoria facing a tedious university course in accounting,
an ongoing battle with mental illness, federal charges which could see
him locked up for ten years, and publicity surrounding the first major
hacking case in Australia. It was going to be a hard winter.</p>

<p id="id01829" class="calibre1">To make matters worse, Electron's medication interfered with his
ability to study properly. The anti-side effect pills relaxed the
muscles in his eyes, preventing them from focusing. The writing on the
blackboard at the front of the lecture hall was nothing but a hazy
blur. Taking notes was also a problem. The medication made his hands
tremble, so he couldn't write properly. By the end of a lecture,
Electron's notes were as unreadable as the blackboard. Frustrated,
Electron stopped taking his medicine, started smoking dope again and
soon felt a little better. When the dope wasn't enough, he turned to
magic mushrooms and hallucinogenic cactus.</p>

<p id="id01830" class="calibre1">The hacking case was dragging on and on. On 6 December 1991, just
after he left psych hospital but before he flew to Queensland, the
office of the DPP had formally filed an indictment containing fifteen
charges against Electron, and three against Nom, in the Victorian
County Court.</p>

<p id="id01831" class="calibre1">Electron didn't talk to Phoenix much any more, but the DPP lawyers
hadn't forgotten about him—far from it. They had much bigger plans
for Phoenix, perhaps because he was fighting every step of the way.
Phoenix was uncooperative with police in the interview on the day of
the raid, frequently refusing to answer their questions. When they
asked to fingerprint him, he refused and argued with them about it.
This behaviour did not endear him to either the police or the DPP.</p>

<p id="id01832" class="calibre1">On 5 May 1992, the DPP filed a final indictment with 40 charges
against Phoenix in the County Court. The charges, in conjunction with
those against Electron and Nom, formed part of a joint indictment
totalling 58 counts.</p>

<p id="id01833" class="calibre1">Electron worried about being sent to prison. Around the world, hackers
were under siege—Par, Pengo, LOD and Erik Bloodaxe, MOD, The Realm
hackers, Pad and Gandalf and, most recently, the International
Subversives. Somebody seemed to be trying to make a point.
Furthermore, Electron's charges had changed considerably—for the
worse—from the original ones documented in April 1990.</p>

<p id="id01834" class="calibre1">The DPP's final indictment bore little resemblance to the original
charge sheet handed to the young hacker when he left the police
station the day he was raided. The final indictment read like a
veritable Who's Who of prestigious institutions around the world.
Lawrence Livermore Labs, California. Two different computers at the US
Naval Research Laboratories, Washington DC. Rutgers University, New
Jersey. Tampere University of Technology, Finland. The University of
Illinios. Three different computers at the University of Melbourne.
Helsinki University of Technology, Finland. The University of New
York. NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia. CSIRO, Carlton,
Victoria.</p>

<p id="id01835" class="calibre1">The charges which worried Electron most related to the
US Naval Research Labs, CSIRO, Lawrence Livermore Labs
and NASA. The last three weren't full hacking charges. The
DPP alleged Electron had been `knowingly concerned' with Phoenix's
access of these sites.</p>

<p id="id01836" class="calibre1">Electron looked at the thirteen-page joint indictment and didn't know
whether to laugh or cry. He had been a lot more than `knowingly
concerned' with accessing those sites. In many cases, he had given
Phoenix access to those computers in the first place. But Electron
tried to tread quietly, carefully, through most systems, while Phoenix
had noisily stomped around with all the grace of a buffalo—and left
just as many footprints. Electron hardly wanted to face full charges
for those or any other sites. He had broken into thousands of sites on
the X.25 network, but he hadn't been charged with any of them. He
couldn't help feeling a little like the gangster Al Capone being done
for tax evasion.</p>

<p id="id01837" class="calibre1">The proceedings were attracting considerable media attention. Electron
suspected the AFP or the DPP were alerting the media to upcoming court
appearances, perhaps in part to prove to the Americans that `something
was being done'.</p>

<p id="id01838" class="calibre1">This case had American pressure written all over it. Electron's
barrister, Boris Kayser, said he suspected that `the
Americans'—American institutions, companies or government
agencies—were indirectly funding some of the prosecution's case by
offering to pay for US witnesses to attend the trial. The Americans
wanted to see the Australian hackers go down, and they were throwing
all their best resources at the case to make sure it happened.</p>

<p id="id01839" class="calibre1">There was one other thing—in some ways the most disturbing matter of
all. In the course of the legal to-ing and fro-ing, Electron was told
that it was the US Secret Service back in 1988 which had triggered the
AFP investigation into The Realm hackers—an investigation which had
led to Electron's bust and current legal problems. The Secret Service
was after the hackers who broke into Citibank.</p>

<p id="id01840" class="calibre1">As it happened, Electron had never touched Citibank. Credit cards
couldn't interest him less. He found banks boring and, the way he
looked at it, their computers were full of mundane numbers belonging
to the world of accounting. He had already suffered through enough of
those tedious types of numbers in his university course. Unless he
wanted to steal from banks—something he would not do—there was no
point in breaking into their computers.</p>

<p id="id01841" class="calibre1">But the US Secret Service was very interested in banks—and in<br class="calibre4"/>

Phoenix. For they didn't just believe that Phoenix had been inside<br class="calibre4"/>

Citibank's computers. They believed he had masterminded the Citibank<br class="calibre4"/>

attack.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01842" class="calibre1">And why did the US Secret Service think that? Because, Electron was
told, Phoenix had gone around bragging about it in the underground. He
hadn't just told people he had hacked into Citibank computers, he
reportedly boasted that he had stolen some $50000 from the bank.</p>

<p id="id01843" class="calibre1">Going through his legal brief, Electron had discovered something which
seemed to confirm what he was being told. The warrant for the
telephone tap on both of Phoenix's home phones mentioned a potential
`serious loss to Citibank' as a justification for the warrant.
Strangely, the typed words had been crossed out in the handwritten
scrawl of the judge who approved the warrant. But they were still
legible. No wonder the US Secret Service began chasing the case,
Electron thought. Banks get upset when they think people have found a
way to rip them off anonymously.</p>

<p id="id01844" class="calibre1">Electron knew that Phoenix hadn't stolen any money from Citibank.
Rather, he had been circulating fantastic stories about himself to
puff up his image in the underground, and in the process had managed
to get them all busted.</p>

<p id="id01845" class="calibre1">In September 1992, Phoenix rang Electron suggesting they get together
to discuss the case. Electron wondered why. Maybe he suspected
something, sensing that the links binding them were weak, and becoming
weaker by the month. That Electron's mental illness had changed his
perception of the world. That his increasingly remote attitude to
Phoenix suggested an underlying anger about the continual bragging.
Whatever the reason, Phoenix's gnawing worry must have been confirmed
when Electron put off meeting with him.</p>

<p id="id01846" class="calibre1">Electron didn't want to meet with Phoenix because he didn't like him,
and because he thought Phoenix was largely responsible for getting the
Australian hackers into their current predicament.</p>

<p id="id01847" class="calibre1">With these thoughts fermenting in his mind, Electron listened with
interest a few months later when his solicitor, John McLoughlin,
proposed an idea. In legal circles, it was nothing new. But it was new
to Electron. He resolved to take up McLoughlin's advice.</p>

<p id="id01848" class="calibre1">Electron decided to testify as a Crown witness against Phoenix.</p>

<h4 id="id01849" class="calibre11">                        Chapter 7 — Judgement Day.</h4>

<p id="id01850" class="calibre2">Your dream world is just about to end.</p>

<p id="id01851" class="calibre1">— from `Dreamworld', Diesel and Dust.</p>

<p id="id01852" class="calibre1">In another corner of the globe, the British hackers Pad and Gandalf
learned with horror that the Australian authorities had busted the
three Realm hackers. Electron had simply disappeared one day. A short
time later, Phoenix was gone too. Then the reports started rolling in
from newspapers and from other Australian hackers on a German board
similar to Altos, called Lutzifer.</p>

<p id="id01853" class="calibre1">Something else worried Pad. In one of his hacking forays, he had
discovered a file, apparently written by Eugene Spafford, which said
he was concerned that some British hackers—read Pad and
Gandalf—would create a new worm, based on the RTM worm, and release
it into the Internet. The unnamed British hackers would then be able
to cause maximum havoc on thousands of Internet sites.</p>

<p id="id01854" class="calibre1">It was true that Gandalf and Pad had captured copies of various worm
source codes. They fished around inside SPAN until they surfaced with
a copy of the Father Christmas worm. And, after finally successfully
hacking Russell Brand's machine at LLNL, they deftly lifted a complete
copy of the WANK worm. In Brand's machine, they also found a
description of how someone had broken into SPAN looking for the WANK
worm code, but hadn't found it. `That was me breaking into SPAN to
look around,' Gandalf laughed, relaying the tale to Pad.</p>

<p id="id01855" class="calibre1">Despite their growing library of worm code, Pad had no intention of
writing any such worm. They simply wanted the code to study what
penetration methods the worms had used and perhaps to learn something
new. The British hackers prided themselves on never having done
anything destructive to systems they hacked. In places where they knew
their activities had been discovered—such as at the Universities of
Bath, Edinburgh, Oxford and Strathclyde—they wrote notes to the
admins signed 8lgm. It wasn't only an ego thing—it was also a way of
telling the admins that they weren't going to do anything nasty to the
system.</p>

<p id="id01856" class="calibre1">At one university, the admins thought 8lgm was some kind
of weird variation on a Belgian word and that the hackers who visited
their systems night after night were from Belgium. At another uni, the
admins made a different guess at the meaning. In the morning, when
they came into work and saw that the hackers had been playing in their
system all night, they would sigh to each other, `Our eight little
green men are at it again'.</p>

<p id="id01857" class="calibre1">At the University of Lancaster, the hackers wrote a message to the
admins which said: `Don't do anything naughty. We have a good image
around the world, so please don't tarnish it or start making up
stories about us messing up systems. Don't hold your breath for us to
hack you, but keep us in mind.' Wherever they went, their message was
the same.</p>

<p id="id01858" class="calibre1">Nonetheless Pad visualised a scenario where Spaf whipped up the
computer security and law enforcement people into a frenzied panic and
tried to pin all sorts of things on the British hackers, none of which
they had done. The underground saw Spaf as being rabid in his attack
on hackers, based largely on his response to the RTM worm. And Gandalf
had hacked Spaf's machine.</p>

<p id="id01859" class="calibre1">The crackdown on the Australians, combined with the discovery of the
Spaf file, had a profound effect on Pad. Always cautious anyway, he
decided to give up hacking. It was a difficult decision, and weaning
himself from exploring systems night after night was no easy task.
However, in the face of what had happened to Electron and Phoenix,
continuing to hack didn't seem worth the risk.</p>

<p id="id01860" class="calibre1">When Pad gave up hacking, he bought his own NUI so he could access
places like Altos legitimately. The NUI was expensive—about
[sterling]10 an hour—but he was never on for long. Leisurely chats of
the type he once enjoyed in Altos were out of the question, but at
least he could mail letters to his friends like Theorem and Gandalf.
There would have been easier ways to maintain his friendship with
Gandalf, who lived in Liverpool, only an hour's drive away. But it
wouldn't be the same. Pad and Gandalf had never met, or even talked on
the phone. They talked on-line, and via email. That was the way they
related.</p>

<p id="id01861" class="calibre1">Pad also had other reasons for giving up hacking. It was an expensive
habit in Britain because British Telecom time-charged for local phone
calls. In Australia, a hacker could stay on-line for hours, jumping
from one computer to another through the data network, all for the
cost of one local call. Like the Australians, Pad could launch his
hacking sessions from a local uni or X.25 dial-up. However, an
all-night hacking session based on a single phone call might still
cost him [sterling]5 or more in timed-call charges—a considerable
amount of money for an unemployed young man. As it was, Pad had
already been forced to stop hacking for brief periods when he ran out
of his dole money.</p>

<p id="id01862" class="calibre1">Although Pad didn't think he could be prosecuted for hacking under
British law in early 1990, he knew that Britain was about to enact its
own computer crime legislation—the Computer Misuse Act 1990—in
August. The 22-year-old hacker decided that it was better to quit
while he was ahead.</p>

<p id="id01863" class="calibre1">And he did, for a while at least. Until July 1990, when Gandalf, two
years his junior, tempted him with one final hack before the new Act
came into force. Just one last fling, Gandalf told him. After that
last fling in July, Pad stopped hacking again.</p>

<p id="id01864" class="calibre1">The Computer Misuse Act passed into law in August 1990, following two
law commission reviews on the subject. The Scottish Law Commission
issued a 1987 report proposing to make unauthorised data access
illegal, but only if the hacker tried to `secure advantage, or cause
damage to another person'—including reckless damage.2 Simple look-see
hacking would not be a crime under the report's recommendations.
However, in 1989 The Law Commission of England and Wales issued its
own report proposing that simple unauthorised access should be a crime
regardless of intent—a recommendation which was eventually included
in the law.</p>

<p id="id01865" class="calibre1">Late in 1989, Conservative MP Michael Colvin introduced a private
member's bill into the British parliament. Lending her support to the
bill, outspoken hacker-critic Emma Nicholson, another Conservative MP,
fired public debate on the subject and ensured the bill passed through
parliament successfully.</p>

<p id="id01866" class="calibre1">In November 1990, Pad was talking on-line with Gandalf, and his friend
suggested they have one more hack, just one more, for old time's sake.
Well, thought Pad, one more—just a one-off thing—wouldn't hurt.</p>

<p id="id01867" class="calibre1">Before long, Pad was hacking regularly again, and when Gandalf tried
to give it up, Pad was there luring him to return to his favourite
pastime. They were like two boys at school, getting each other into
trouble—the kind of trouble which always comes in pairs. If Pad and
Gandalf hadn't known each other, they probably would both have walked
away from hacking forever in 1990.</p>

<p id="id01868" class="calibre1">As they both got back into the swing of things, they tried to make
light of the risk of getting caught. `Hey, you know,' Gandalf joked
on-line more than once, `the first time we actually meet each other in
person will probably be in a police station.'</p>

<p id="id01869" class="calibre1">Completely irreverent and always upbeat, Gandalf proved to be a true
friend. Pad had rarely met such a fellow traveller in the real world,
let alone on-line. What others—particularly some American
hackers—viewed as prickliness, Pad saw as the perfect sense of
humour. To Pad, Gandalf was the best m8 a fellow could ever have.</p>

<p id="id01870" class="calibre1">During the time Pad avoided hacking, Gandalf had befriended another,
younger hacker named Wandii, also from the north of England. Wandii
never played much of a part in the international computer underground,
but he did spend a lot of time hacking European computers. Wandii and
Pad got along pleasantly but they were never close. They were
acquaintances, bound by ties to Gandalf in the underground.</p>

<p id="id01871" class="calibre1">By the middle of June 1991, Pad, Gandalf and Wandii were peaking. At
least one of them—and often more—had already broken into systems
belonging to the European Community in Luxembourg, The Financial Times
(owners of the FTSE 100 share index), the British Ministry of Defence,
the Foreign Office, NASA, the investment bank SG Warburg in London,
the American computer database software manufacturer Oracle, and more
machines on the JANET network than they could remember. Pad had also
penetrated a classified military network containing a NATO system.
They moved through British Telecom's Packet Switched Stream Network
(PSS), which was similar to the Tymnet X.25 network, with absolute
ease.3</p>

<p id="id01872" class="calibre1">Gandalf's motto was, `If it moves, hack it'.</p>

<p id="id01873" class="calibre2">On 27 June 1991, Pad was sitting in the front room of his parent's
comfortable home in greater Manchester watching the last remnants of
daylight disappear on one of the longest days of the year. He loved
summer, loved waking up to streaks of sunlight sneaking through the
cracks in his bedroom curtain. He often thought to himself, it doesn't
get much better than this.</p>

<p id="id01874" class="calibre1">Around 11 p.m. he flicked on his modem and his Atari 520 ST computer
in the front sitting room. There were two Atari computers in the
house—indicative of his deep enthusiasm for computers since neither
his siblings nor his parents had any interest in programming. Most of
the time, however, Pad left the older Atari alone. His elder brother,
an aspiring chemist, used it for writing his PhD thesis.</p>

<p id="id01875" class="calibre1">Before dialling out, Pad checked that no-one was on the house's single
phone line. Finding it free, he went to check his email on Lutzifer. A
few minutes after watching his machine connect to the German board, he
heard a soft thud, followed by a creaking. Pad stopped typing, looked
up from his machine and listened. He wondered if his brother, reading
in their bedroom upstairs, or his parents, watching telly in the back
lounge room, could hear the creaking.</p>

<p id="id01876" class="calibre1">The sound became more pronounced and Pad swung around and looked
toward the hallway. In a matter of seconds, the front door frame had
been cracked open, prising the door away from its lock. The wood had
been torn apart by some sort of car jack, pumped up until the door
gave way.</p>

<p id="id01877" class="calibre1">Suddenly, a group of men burst through from the front doorstep, dashed
down the long hallway and shot up the carpeted stairs to Pad's
bedroom.</p>

<p id="id01878" class="calibre1">Still sitting at his computer downstairs, Pad swiftly flicked his
modem, and then his computer, off—instantly killing his connection
and everything on his screen. He turned back toward the door leading
to the sitting room and strained to hear what was happening upstairs.
If he wasn't so utterly surprised, he would almost have laughed. He
realised that when the police had dashed up to his bedroom, they had
been chasing every stereotype about hackers they had probably ever
read. The boy. In his bedroom. Hunched over his computer. Late at
night.</p>

<p id="id01879" class="calibre1">They did find a young man in the bedroom, with a computer. But it was
the wrong one, and for all intents and purposes the wrong computer. It
took the police almost ten minutes of quizzing Pad's brother to work
out their mistake.</p>

<p id="id01880" class="calibre1">Hearing a commotion, Pad's parents had rushed into the hallway while<br class="calibre4"/>

Pad peered from the doorway of the front sitting room. A uniformed<br class="calibre4"/>

police officer ushered everyone back into the room, and began asking<br class="calibre4"/>

Pad questions.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01881" class="calibre1">`Do you use computers? Do you use the name Pad on computers?' they
asked.</p>

<p id="id01882" class="calibre1">Pad concluded the game was up. He answered their questions truthfully.
Hacking was not such a serious crime after all, he thought. It wasn't
as if he had stolen money or anything. This would be a drama, but he
was easy-going. He would roll with the punches, cop a slap on the
wrist and soon the whole thing would be over and done with.</p>

<p id="id01883" class="calibre1">The police took Pad to his bedroom and asked him questions as they
searched the room. The bedroom had a comfortably lived-in look, with a
few small piles of clothes in the corner, some shoes scattered across
the floor, the curtains hanging crooked, and a collection of music
posters—Jimi Hendrix and The Smiths—taped to the wall.</p>

<p id="id01884" class="calibre1">A group of police hovered around his computer. One of them began to
search through Pad's books on the shelves above the PC, checking each
one as he pulled it down. A few well-loved Spike Milligan works. Some
old chess books from when he was captain of the local chess team.
Chemistry books, purchased by Pad long before he took any classes in
the subject, just to satisfy his curiosity. Physics books. An
oceanography textbook. A geology book bought after a visit to a cave
excited his interest in the formation of rocks. Pad's mother, a
nursing sister, and his father, an electronics engineer who tested
gyros on aircraft, had always encouraged their children's interest in
the sciences.</p>

<p id="id01885" class="calibre1">The policeman returned those books to the shelves, only picking out
the computer books, textbooks from programming and maths classes Pad
had taken at a Manchester university. The officer carefully slid them
inside plastic bags to be taken away as
evidence.</p>

<p id="id01886" class="calibre1">Then the police picked through Pad's music tapes—The Stone Roses,
Pixies, New Order, The Smiths and lots of indie music from the
flourishing Manchester music scene. No evidence of anything but an
eclectic taste in music there.</p>

<p id="id01887" class="calibre1">Another policeman opened Pad's wardrobe and peered inside. `Anything
in here of interest?' he asked.</p>

<p id="id01888" class="calibre1">`No,' Pad answered. `It's all over here.' He pointed to the box of
computer disks.</p>

<p id="id01889" class="calibre1">Pad didn't think there was much point in the police tearing the place
to pieces, when they would ultimately find everything they wanted
anyway. Nothing was hidden. Unlike the Australian hackers, Pad hadn't
been expecting the police at all. Although part of the data on his
hard drive was encrypted, there was plenty of incriminating evidence
in the un-encrypted files.</p>

<p id="id01890" class="calibre1">Pad couldn't hear exactly what his parents were talking about with the
police in the other room, but he could tell they were calm. Why
shouldn't they be? It wasn't as if their son had done anything
terrible. He hadn't beaten someone up in a fist fight at a pub, or
robbed anyone. He hadn't hit someone while drunk driving. No, they
thought, he had just been fiddling around with computers. Maybe poking
around where he shouldn't have been, but that was hardly a serious
crime. They needn't worry. It wasn't as if he was going to prison or
anything. The police would sort it all out. Maybe some sort of
citation, and the matter would be over and done. Pad's mother even
offered to make cups of tea for the police.</p>

<p id="id01891" class="calibre1">One of the police struck up a conversation with Pad off to the side as
he paused to drink his tea. He seemed to know that Pad was on the
dole, and with a completely straight face, he said, `If you wanted a
job, why didn't you just join the police?'</p>

<p id="id01892" class="calibre1">Pad paused for a reality check. Here he was being raided by nearly a
dozen law enforcement officers—including representatives from BT and
Scotland Yard's computer crimes unit—for hacking hundreds of
computers and this fellow wanted to know why he hadn't just become a
copper?</p>

<p id="id01893" class="calibre1">He tried not to laugh. Even if he hadn't been busted, there is no way
he would ever have contemplated joining the police. Never in a million
years. His family and friends, while showing a pleasant veneer of
middle-class orderliness, were fundamentally anti-establishment. Many
knew that Pad had been hacking, and which sites he had penetrated.
Their attitude was: Hacking Big Brother? Good on you.</p>

<p id="id01894" class="calibre1">His parents were torn, wanting to encourage Pad's interest in
computers but also worrying their son spent an inordinate amount of
time glued to the screen. Their mixed feelings mirrored Pad's own
occasional concern.</p>

<p id="id01895" class="calibre1">While deep in the throes of endless hacking nights, he would suddenly
sit upright and ask himself, What am I doing here, fucking around on a
computer all day and night? Where is this heading? What about the rest
of life? Then he would disentangle himself from hacking for a few days
or weeks. He would go down to the university pub to drink with his
mostly male group of friends from his course.</p>

<p id="id01896" class="calibre1">Tall, with short brown hair, a slender physique and a handsomely
boyish face, the soft-spoken Pad would have been considered attractive
by many intelligent girls. The problem was finding those sort of
girls. He hadn't met many when he was studying at university—there
were few women in his maths and computer classes. So he and his
friends used to head down to the Manchester nightclubs for the social
scene and the good music.</p>

<p id="id01897" class="calibre1">Pad went downstairs with one of the officers and watched as the police
unplugged his 1200 baud modem, then tucked it into a plastic bag. He
had bought that modem when he was eighteen. The police unplugged
cables, bundled them up and slipped them into labelled plastic bags.
They gathered up his 20 megabyte hard drive and monitor. More plastic
bags and labels.</p>

<p id="id01898" class="calibre1">One of the officers called Pad over to the front door. The jack was
still wedged across the mutilated door frame. The police had broken
down the door instead of knocking because they wanted to catch the
hacker in the act—on-line. The officer motioned for Pad to follow
him.</p>

<p id="id01899" class="calibre1">`Come on,' he said, leading the hacker into the night. `We're taking
you to the station.'</p>

<p id="id01900" class="calibre1">Pad spent the night in a cell at the Salford Crescent police
station, alone. No rough crims, and no other hackers either.</p>

<p id="id01901" class="calibre1">He settled into one of the metal cots lined against the perimeter of
the cell, but sleep evaded him. Pad wondered if Gandalf had been
raided as well. There was no sign of him, but then again, the police
would hardly be stupid enough to lock up the two hackers together. He
tossed and turned, trying to push thoughts from his head.</p>

<p id="id01902" class="calibre1">Pad had fallen into hacking almost by accident. Compared to others in
the underground, he had taken it up at a late age—around nineteen.
Altos had been the catalyst. Visiting BBSes, he read a file describing
not only what Altos was, but how to get there—complete with NUI.
Unlike the Australian underground, the embryonic British underground
had no shortage of NUIs. Someone had discovered a stack of BT NUIs and
posted them on BBSes across England.</p>

<p id="id01903" class="calibre1">Pad followed the directions in the BBS file and soon found himself in
the German chat channel. Like Theorem, he marvelled at the brave new
live world of Altos. It was wonderful, a big international party.
After all, it wasn't every day he got to talk with Australians, Swiss,
Germans, Italians and Americans. Before long, he had taken up hacking
like so many other Altos regulars.</p>

<p id="id01904" class="calibre1">Hacking as a concept had always intrigued him. As a teenager, the film
War Games had dazzled him. The idea that computers could communicate
with each over telephone lines enthralled the sixteen-year-old,
filling his mind with new ideas. Sometime after that he saw a
television report on a group of hackers who claimed that they had used
their skills to move satellites around in space—the same story which
had first caught Electron's imagination.</p>

<p id="id01905" class="calibre1">Pad had grown up in Greater Manchester. More than a century before,
the region had been a textile boom-town. But the thriving economy did
not translate into great wealth for the masses. In the early 1840s,
Friedrich Engels had worked in his father's cotton-milling factory in
the area, and the suffering
he saw in the region influenced his most famous work, The Communist
Manifesto, published in 1848.</p>

<p id="id01906" class="calibre1">Manchester wore the personality of a working-class town, a place where
people often disliked the establishment and
distrusted authority figures. The 1970s and 1980s had not been kind to
most of Greater Manchester, with unemployment and urban decay
disfiguring the once-proud textile hub. But this decay only appeared
to strengthen an underlying resolve among many from the working
classes to challenge the symbols of power.</p>

<p id="id01907" class="calibre1">Pad didn't live in a public housing high-rise. He lived in a suburban
middle-class area, in an old, working-class town removed from the
dismal inner-city. But like many people from the north, he disliked
pretensions. Indeed, he harboured a healthy degree of good-natured
scepticism, perhaps stemming from a culture of mates whose favourite
pastime was pulling each other's leg down at the pub.</p>

<p id="id01908" class="calibre1">This scepticism was in full-gear as he watched the story of how
hackers supposedly moved satellites around in space, but somehow the
idea slipped through the checkpoints and captured his imagination,
just as it had done with Electron. He felt a desire to find out for
himself if it was true and he began pursuing hacking in enthusiastic
bursts. At first it was any moderately interesting system. Then he
moved to the big-name systems—computers belonging to large
institutions. Eventually, working with the Australians, he learned to
target computer security experts. That was, after all, where the
treasure was stored.</p>

<p id="id01909" class="calibre1">In the morning at the police station, a guard gave Pad something to
eat which might have passed for food. Then he was escorted into an
interview room with two plain-clothed officers and a BT
representative.</p>

<p id="id01910" class="calibre1">Did he want a lawyer? No. He had nothing to hide. Besides, the police
had already seized evidence from his house, including unencrypted data
logs of his hacking sessions. How could he argue against that? So he
faced his stern inquisitors and answered their questions willingly.</p>

<p id="id01911" class="calibre1">Suddenly things began to take a different turn when they began asking
about the `damage' he had done inside the Greater London Polytechnic's
computers. Damage? What damage? Pad certainly hadn't damaged anything.</p>

<p id="id01912" class="calibre1">Yes, the police told him. The damage totalling almost a quarter of a
million pounds.</p>

<p id="id01913" class="calibre1">Pad gasped in horror. A quarter of a million pounds? He thought back
to his many forays into the system. He had been a little mischievous,
changing the welcome message to `Hi' and signing it 8lgm. He had made
a few accounts for himself so he could log in at a later date. That
seemed to be nothing special, however, since he and Gandalf had a
habit of making accounts called 8lgm for themselves in JANET systems.
He had also erased logs of his activities to cover his tracks, but
again, this was not unusual, and he had certainly never deleted any
computer users' files. The whole thing had just been a bit of fun, a
bit of cat and mouse gaming with the system admins. There was nothing
he could recall which would account for that kind of damage. Surely
they had the wrong hacker?</p>

<p id="id01914" class="calibre1">No, he was the right one all right. Eighty investigators from BT,
Scotland Yard and other places had been chasing the 8lgm hackers for
two years. They had phone traces, logs seized from his computer and
logs from the hacked sites. They knew it was him.</p>

<p id="id01915" class="calibre1">For the first time, the true gravity of the situation hit Pad. These
people believed in some way that he had committed serious criminal
damage, that he had even been malicious.</p>

<p id="id01916" class="calibre1">After about two hours of questioning, they put Pad back in his cell.<br class="calibre4"/>

More questions tomorrow, they told him.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01917" class="calibre1">Later that afternoon, an officer came in to tell Pad his mother and
father were outside. He could meet with them in the visiting area.
Talking through a glass barrier, Pad tried to reassure his worried
parents. After five minutes, an officer told the family the visit was
over. Amid hurried goodbyes under the impatient stare of the guard,
Pad's parents told him they had brought something for him to read in
his cell. It was the oceanography textbook.</p>

<p id="id01918" class="calibre1">Back in his cell, he tried to read, but he couldn't concentrate. He
kept replaying his visits to the London Polytechnic over and over in
his mind, searching for how he might have inadvertently done
[sterling]250000 worth of damage. Pad was a very good hacker; it
wasn't as if he was some fourteen-year-old kid barging through systems
like a bull in china shop. He knew how to get in and out of a system
without hurting it.</p>

<p id="id01919" class="calibre1">Shortly after 8 p.m., as Pad sat on his cot stewing over the police
damage claims, sombre music seemed to fill his cell. Slowly at first,
an almost imperceptible moaning, which subtly transformed into solemn
but recognisable notes. It sounded like Welsh choir music, and it was
coming from above him.</p>

<p id="id01920" class="calibre1">Pad looked up at the ceiling. The music—all male voices— stopped
abruptly, then started again, repeating the same heavy, laboured
notes. The hacker smiled. The local police choir was practising right
above his cell.</p>

<p id="id01921" class="calibre1">After another fitful night, Pad faced one more round of interviews.
The police did most of the questioning, but they didn't seem to know
much about computers—well, not nearly so much as any good hacker on
Altos. Whenever either of the police asked a technical question, they
looked over to the BT guy at the other end of the table as if to say,
`Does this make any sense?' The BT guy would give a slight nod, then
the police looked back at Pad for an answer. Most of the time, he was
able to decipher what they thought they were trying to ask, and he
answered accordingly.</p>

<p id="id01922" class="calibre1">Then it was back to his cell while they processed his charge sheets.
Alone again, Pad wondered once more if they had raided Gandalf. Like
an answer from above, Pad heard telephone tones through the walls. The
police seemed to be playing them over and over. That was when he knew
they had Gandalf too.</p>

<p id="id01923" class="calibre1">Gandalf had rigged up a tone dialler in his computer. It sounded as if
the police were playing with it, trying to figure it out.</p>

<p id="id01924" class="calibre1">So, Pad would finally meet Gandalf in person after two years. What
would he look like? Would they have the same chemistry in person as
on-line? Pad felt like he knew Gandalf, knew his essence, but meeting
in person could be a bit tricky.</p>

<p id="id01925" class="calibre1">Explaining that the paperwork, including the charge sheets, had
finally been organised, a police officer unlocked Pad's cell door and
led him to a foyer, telling him he would be meeting both Gandalf and
Wandii. A large collection of police had formed a semi-circle around
two other young men. In addition to Scotland Yard's Computer Crimes
Unit and BT, at least seven other police forces were involved in the
three raids, including those from Greater Manchester, Merseyside and
West Yorkshire. The officers were curious about the hackers.</p>

<p id="id01926" class="calibre1">For most of the two years of their investigation, the police didn't
even know the hackers' real identities. After such a long, hard chase,
the police had been forced to wait a little longer, since they wanted
to nab each hacker while he was on-line. That meant hiding outside
each hacker's home until he logged in somewhere. Any system would do
and they didn't have to be talking to each other on-line—as long as
the login was illegal. The police had sat patiently, and finally
raided the hackers within hours of each other, so they didn't have
time to warn one another.</p>

<p id="id01927" class="calibre1">So, at the end of the long chase and a well-timed operation, the
police wanted to have a look at the hackers up close.</p>

<p id="id01928" class="calibre1">After the officer walked Pad up to the group, he introduced Gandalf.
Tall, lean with brown hair and pale skin, he looked a little bit like
Pad. The two hackers smiled shyly at each other, before one of the
police pointed out Wandii, the seventeen-year-old schoolboy. Pad
didn't get a good look at Wandii, because the police quickly lined the
hackers up in a row, with Gandalf in the middle, to explain details to
them. They were being charged under the Computer Misuse Act of 1990.
Court dates would be set and they would be notified.</p>

<p id="id01929" class="calibre1">When they were finally allowed to leave, Wandii seemed to disappear.
Pad and Gandalf walked outside, found a couple of benches and lay
down, basking in the sun and chatting while they waited for their
rides home.</p>

<p id="id01930" class="calibre1">Gandalf proved to be as easy to talk to in person as he was on-line.
They exchanged phone numbers and shared notes on the police raids.
Gandalf had insisted on meeting a lawyer before his interviews, but
when the lawyer arrived he didn't have the slightest understanding of
computer crime. He advised Gandalf to tell the police whatever they
wanted to know, so the hacker did.</p>

<p id="id01931" class="calibre1">The trial was being held in London. Pad wondered why, if all three
hackers were from the north, the case was being tried in the south.
After all, there was a court in Manchester which was high enough to
deal with their crimes.</p>

<p id="id01932" class="calibre1">Maybe it was because Scotland Yard was in London. Maybe they had
started the paperwork down there. Maybe it was because they were being
accused of hacking computers located within the jurisdiction of the
Central Criminal Court—that court being the Old Bailey in London. But
Pad's cynical side hazarded a different guess—a guess which seemed
justified after a few procedural appearances in 1992 before the trial,
which was set for 1993. For when Pad arrived at the Bow Street
Magistrates Court for his committal in April 1992, he saw it packed
out with the media, just as he had anticipated.</p>

<p id="id01933" class="calibre1">A few hackers also fronted up to fly the flag of the underground. One
of them—a stranger—came up to Pad after court, patted him on the
back and exclaimed enthusiastically, `Well done, Paddy!' Startled, Pad
just looked at him and then smiled. He had no idea how to respond to
the stranger.</p>

<p id="id01934" class="calibre1">Like the three Australian hackers, Pad, Gandalf and the little-known
Wandii were serving as the test case for new hacking laws in their
country. British law enforcement agencies had spent a fortune on the
case—more than [sterling]500000 according to the newspapers—by the
time the 8lgm case went to trial. This was going to be a show case,
and the government agencies wanted taxpayers to know they were getting
their money's worth.</p>

<p id="id01935" class="calibre1">The hackers weren't being charged with breaking into computers. They
were being charged with conspiracy, a more serious offence. While
admitting the threesome did not hack for personal gain, the
prosecution alleged the hackers had conspired to break into and modify
computer systems. It was a strange approach to say the least,
considering that none of the three hackers had ever met or even talked
to the others before they were arrested.</p>

<p id="id01936" class="calibre1">It was not so strange, however, when looking at the potential
penalties. If the hackers had been charged with simply breaking into a
machine, without intending any harm, the maximum penalty was six
months jail and a fine of up to [sterling]5000. However, conspiracy,
which was covered under a different section of the Act, could bring up
to five years in jail and an unlimited amount in fines.</p>

<p id="id01937" class="calibre1">The prosecution was taking a big gamble. It would be harder to prove
conspiracy charges, which required demonstration of greater criminal
intent than lesser charges. The potential pay-off was of course also
much greater. If convicted, the defendants in Britain's most important
hacking case to date would be going to prison.</p>

<p id="id01938" class="calibre1">As with The Realm case, two hackers—Pad and Gandalf—planned to plead
guilty while the third—in this case Wandii—planned to fight the
charges every step of the way. Legal Aid was footing the bill for
their lawyers, because the hackers were either not working or were
working in such lowly paid, short-term jobs they qualified for free
legal support.</p>

<p id="id01939" class="calibre1">Wandii's lawyers told the media that this showcase was tantamount to a
state trial. It was the first major hacking case under the new
legislation which didn't involve disgruntled employees. While having
no different legal status from a normal trial, the term state trial
suggested a greater degree of official wrath—the kind usually
reserved for cases of treason.</p>

<p id="id01940" class="calibre1">On 22 February 1993, within two months of Electron's decision to turn
Crown witness against Phoenix and Nom, the three 8lgm hackers stood in
the dock at Southwark Crown Court in South London to enter pleas in
their own case.</p>

<p id="id01941" class="calibre1">In the dim winter light, Southwark couldn't look less appealing, but
that didn't deter the crowds. The courtroom was going to be packed,
just as Bow Street had been. Scotland Yard detectives were turning out
in force. The crowd shuffled toward Room 12.</p>

<p id="id01942" class="calibre1">The prosecution told the media they had about 800 computer disks full
of evidence and court materials. If all the data had been printed out
on A4 paper, the stack would tower more than 40 metres in the air,
they said. Considering the massive amount of evidence being heaved,
rolled and tugged through the building by teams of legal eagles, the
choice of location—on the fifth floor—proved to be a challenge.</p>

<p id="id01943" class="calibre1">Standing in the dock next to Wandii, Pad and Gandalf pleaded guilty to
two computer conspiracy charges: conspiring to dishonestly obtain
telecommunications services, and conspiring to cause unauthorised
modification to computer material. Pad also pleaded guilty to a third
charge: causing damage to a computer. This last charge related to the
almost a quarter of
a million pounds worth of `damage' to the Central London Polytechnic.
Unlike the Australians' case, none of the British hackers faced
charges about specific sites such as NASA.</p>

<p id="id01944" class="calibre1">Pad and Gandalf pleaded guilty because they didn't think they had much
choice. Their lawyers told them that, in light of the evidence,
denying their guilt was simply not a realistic option. Better to throw
yourself on the mercy of the court, they advised. As if to underline
the point, Gandalf's lawyer had told him after a meeting at the end of
1992, `I'd like to wish you a happy Christmas, but I don't think it's
going to be one'.</p>

<p id="id01945" class="calibre1">Wandii's lawyers disagreed. Standing beside his fellow hackers, Wandii
pleaded not guilty to three conspiracy charges: plotting to gain
unauthorised access to computers, conspiring to make unauthorised
modifications to computer material, and conspiring to obtain
telecommunications services dishonestly. His defence team was going to
argue that he was addicted to computer hacking and that, as a result
of this addiction, he was not able to form the criminal intent
necessary to be convicted.</p>

<p id="id01946" class="calibre1">Pad thought Wandii's case was on shaky ground. Addiction didn't seem a
plausible defence to him, and he noticed Wandii looked very nervous in
court just after his plea.</p>

<p id="id01947" class="calibre1">Pad and Gandalf left London after their court appearance, returning to
the north to prepare for their sentencing hearings, and to watch the
progress of Wandii's case through the eyes of the media.</p>

<p id="id01948" class="calibre1">They weren't disappointed. It was a star-studded show. The media
revved itself up for a feeding frenzy and the prosecution team, headed
by James Richardson, knew how to feed the pack. He zeroed in on
Wandii, telling the court how the schoolboy `was tapping into offices
at the EC in Luxembourg and even the experts were worried. He caused
havoc at universities all around the world'.4 To do this, Wandii had
used a simple BBC Micro computer, a Christmas present costing
[sterling]200.</p>

<p id="id01949" class="calibre1">The hacking didn't stop at European Community's computer, Richardson
told the eager crowd of journalists. Wandii had hacked Lloyd's, The
Financial Times and Leeds University. At The Financial Times machine,
Wandii's adventures had upset the smooth operations of the FTSE 100
share index, known in the City as `footsie'. The hacker installed a
scanning program in the FT's network, resulting in one outgoing call
made every second. The upshot of Wandii's intrusion: a [sterling]704
bill, the deletion of an important file and a management decision to
shut down a key system. With the precision of a banker, FT computer
boss Tony Johnson told the court that the whole incident had cost his
organisation [sterling]24871.</p>

<p id="id01950" class="calibre1">But the FT hack paled next to the prosecution's real trump card: The
European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer in
Brussels. They had been left with a [sterling]10000 phone bill as a
result of a scanner Wandii left on its machine,5 the court was told.
The scanner had left a trail of 50000 calls, all documented on a
980-page phone bill.</p>

<p id="id01951" class="calibre1">The scanner resulted in the system going down for a day, EORTC
information systems project manager Vincent Piedboeuf, told the jury.
He went on to explain that the centre needed its system to run 24
hours a day, so surgeons could register patients. The centre's
database was the focal point for pharmaceutical companies, doctors and
research centres—all coordinating their efforts in fighting the
disease.</p>

<p id="id01952" class="calibre1">For the media, the case was headline heaven. `Teenage computer hacker
"caused worldwide chaos"' the Daily Telegraph screamed across page
one. On page three, the Daily Mail jumped in with `Teenage hacker
"caused chaos for kicks"'. Even The Times waded into the fray.
Smaller, regional newspapers pulled the story across the countryside
to the far reaches of the British Isles. The Herald in Glasgow told
its readers `Teenage hacker "ran up [sterling]10000 telephone bill"'.
Across the Irish Sea, the Irish Times caused a splash with its
headline, `Teenage hacker broke EC computer security'.</p>

<p id="id01953" class="calibre1">Also in the first week of the case, The Guardian announced Wandii had
taken down the cancer centre database. By the time The Independent got
hold of the story, Wandii hadn't just shut down the database, he had
been reading the patients' most intimate medical details: `Teenager
"hacked into cancer patient files"'. Not to be outdone, on day four of
the trial, the Daily Mail had christened Wandii as a `computer
genius'. By day five it labelled him as a `computer invader' who `cost
FT [sterling]25000'.</p>

<p id="id01954" class="calibre1">The list went on. Wandii, the press announced, had hacked the Tokyo
Zoo and the White House. It was difficult to tell which was the more
serious offence.</p>

<p id="id01955" class="calibre1">Wandii's defence team had a few tricks of its own. Ian MacDonald, QC,
junior counsel Alistair Kelman and solicitor Deborah Tripley put
London University Professor James Griffith-Edwards, an authoritative
spokesman on addictive and compulsive behaviours, on the stand as an
expert witness. The chairman of the National Addiction Centre, the
professor had been part of a team which wrote the World Health
Organisation's definition of addiction. No-one was going to question
his qualifications.</p>

<p id="id01956" class="calibre1">The professor had examined Wandii and he announced his conclusion to
the court: Wandii was obsessed by computers, he was unable to stop
using them, and his infatuation made it impossible for him to choose
freely. `He repeated 12 times in police interviews, "I'm just
addicted. I wish I wasn't",' Griffith-Edwards told the court. Wandii
was highly intelligent, but was unable to escape from the urge to beat
computers' security systems at their own game. The hacker was obsessed
by the intellectual challenge. `This is the core … of what attracts
the compulsive gambler,' the professor explained to the entranced jury
of three women and nine men.</p>

<p id="id01957" class="calibre1">But Wandii, this obsessive, addicted, gifted young man, had never had
a girlfriend, Griffith-Edwards continued. In fact, he shyly admitted
to the professor that he wouldn't even know how to ask a girl out. `He
[Wandii] became profoundly embarrassed when asked to talk about his
own feelings. He simply couldn't cope when asked what sort of person
he was.'6</p>

<p id="id01958" class="calibre1">People in the jury edged forward in their seats, concentrating
intently on the distinguished professor. And why wouldn't they? This
was amazing stuff. This erudite man had delved inside the mind of the
young man of bizarre contrasts. A man so sophisticated that he could
pry open computers belonging to some of Britain's and Europe's most
prestigious institutions, and yet at the same time so simple that he
had no idea how to ask a girl on a date. A man who was addicted not to
booze, smack or speed, which the average person associates with
addiction, but to a computer—a machine most people associated with
kids' games and word processing programs.</p>

<p id="id01959" class="calibre1">The defence proceeded to present vivid examples of Wandii's addiction.
Wandii's mother, a single parent and lecturer in English, had terrible
trouble trying to get her son away from his computer and modem. She
tried hiding his modem. He found it. She tried again, hiding it at his
grandmother's house. He burgled granny's home and retrieved it. His
mother tried to get at his computer. He pushed her out of his attic
room and down the stairs.</p>

<p id="id01960" class="calibre1">Then he ran up a [sterling]700 phone bill as a result of his hacking.
His mother switched off the electricity at the mains. Her son
reconnected it. She installed a security calling-code on the phone to
stop him calling out. He broke it. She worried he wouldn't go out and
do normal teenage things. He continued to stay up all night—and
sometimes all day—hacking. She returned from work to find him
unconscious—sprawled across the living room floor and looking as
though he was dead. But it wasn't death, only sheer exhaustion. He
hacked until he passed out, then he woke up and hacked some more.</p>

<p id="id01961" class="calibre1">The stories of Wandii's self-confessed addiction overwhelmed, appalled
and eventually engendered pity in the courtroom audience. The media
began calling him `the hermit hacker'.</p>

<p id="id01962" class="calibre1">Wandii's defence team couldn't fight the prosecution's
evidence head-on, so they took the prosecution's evidence and claimed
it as their own. They showed the jury that Wandii hadn't just hacked
the institutions named by the prosecution; he had hacked far, far more
than that. He didn't just hack a lot—he hacked too much. Most of all,
Wandii's defence team gave the jury a reason to acquit the
innocent-faced young man sitting before them.</p>

<p id="id01963" class="calibre1">During the trial, the media focused on Wandii, but didn't completely
ignore the other two hackers. Computer Weekly hunted down where
Gandalf was working and laid it bare on the front page. A member of
`the UK's most notorious hacking gang', the journal announced, had
been working on software which would be used at Barclay's Bank.7 The
implication was clear. Gandalf was a terrible security risk and should
never be allowed to do any work for a financial institution. The
report irked the hackers, but they tried to concentrate on preparing
for their sentencing hearing.</p>

<p id="id01964" class="calibre1">From the beginning of their case, the hackers had problems obtaining
certain evidence. Pad and Gandalf believed some of the material seized
in the police raids would substantially help their case—such as
messages from admins thanking them for pointing out security holes on
their systems. This material had not been included in the
prosecution's brief. When the defendants requested access to it, they
were refused access on the grounds that there was classified data on
the optical disk. They were told to go read the Attorney-General's
guidelines on disclosure of information. The evidence of the hackers'
forays into military and government systems was jumbled in with their
intrusions into computers such as benign JANET systems, the defence
team was told. It would take too much time to separate the two.</p>

<p id="id01965" class="calibre1">Eventually, after some wrangling, Pad and Gandalf were told they could
inspect and copy material—provided it was done under the supervision
of the police. The hackers travelled to London, to Holborn police
station, to gather supporting evidence for their case. However, it
soon became clear that this time-consuming exercise would be
impossible to manage on an ongoing basis. Finally, the Crown
Prosecution Service relented, agreeing to release the material on disk
to Pad's solicitor, on the proviso that no copies were made, it did
not leave the law office, and it was returned at the end of the trial.</p>

<p id="id01966" class="calibre1">As Wandii's case lurched from revelation to exaggeration, Pad and
Gandalf busily continued to prepare for their own sentencing hearing.
Every day, Gandalf travelled from Liverpool to Manchester to meet with
his friend. They picked up a handful of newspapers at the local agent,
and then headed up to Pad's lawyer's office. After a quick scan for
articles covering the hacking case, the two hackers began sifting
through the reluctantly released prosecution disks. They read through
the material on computer, under the watchful eye of the law office's
cashier—the most computer literate person in the firm.</p>

<p id="id01967" class="calibre1">After fifteen days in the Southwark courtroom listening to fantastic
stories from both sides about the boy sitting before them, the jury in
Wandii's trial retired to consider the evidence. Before they left,
Judge Harris gave them a stern warning: the argument that Wandii was
obsessed or dependent was not a defence against the charges.</p>

<p id="id01968" class="calibre1">It took the jurors only 90 minutes to reach a decision, and when the
verdict was read out the courtroom erupted with a wave of emotion.</p>

<p id="id01969" class="calibre1">Not guilty. On all counts.</p>

<p id="id01970" class="calibre1">Wandii's mother burst into a huge smile and turned to her son, who was
also smiling. And the defence team couldn't be happier. Kelman told
journalists, `The jury felt this was a sledge hammer being used to
crack a nut'.8</p>

<p id="id01971" class="calibre1">The prosecution was stunned and the law enforcement agents
flabbergasted. Detective Sergeant Barry Donovan found the verdict
bizarre. No other case in his 21 years in law enforcement had as much
overwhelming evidence as this one, yet the jury had let Wandii walk.</p>

<p id="id01972" class="calibre1">And in a high-pitched frenzy rivalling its earlier hysteria, the
British media jumped all over the jury's decision. `Hacker who ravaged
systems walks free', an indignant Guardian announced. `Computer Genius
is cleared of hacking conspiracy', said the Evening Standard. `Hacking
"addict" acquitted', sniffed The Times. Overpowering them all was the
Daily Telegraph's page one: `Teenage computer addict who hacked White
House system is cleared'.</p>

<p id="id01973" class="calibre1">Then came the media king-hit. Someone had leaked another story and it
looked bad. The report, in the Mail on Sunday, said that the three
hackers had broken into a Cray computer at the European Centre for
Medium Range Weather Forecasting at Bracknell. This computer, likes
dozens of others, would normally have been relegated to the long list
of unmentioned victims except for one thing. The US military used
weather data from the centre for planning its attack on Iraq in the
Gulf War. The media report claimed that the attack had slowed down the
Cray's calculations, thus endangering the whole Desert Storm
operation. The paper announced the hackers had been `inadvertently
jeopardising—almost fatally—the international effort against Saddam
Hussein' and had put `thousands of servicemen's lives at risk'.9</p>

<p id="id01974" class="calibre1">Further, the paper alleged that the US State Department was so
incensed about British hackers' repeated break-ins disrupting Pentagon
defence planning that it had complained to Prime Minister John Major.
The White House put the matter more bluntly than the State Department:
Stop your hackers or we will cut off European access to our satellite
which provides trans-Atlantic data and voice telecommunications.
Someone in Britain seemed to be listening, for less than twelve months
later, authorities had arrested all three hackers.</p>

<p id="id01975" class="calibre1">Pad thought the allegations were rubbish. He had been inside a VAX
machine at the weather centre for a couple of hours one night, but he
had never touched a Cray there. He had certainly never done anything
to slow the machine down. No cracking programs, no scanners, nothing
which might account for the delay described in the report. Even if he
had been responsible, he found it hard to believe the Western allies'
victory in the Gulf War was determined by one computer in Berkshire.</p>
