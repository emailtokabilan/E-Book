    Mostly, he haunted Sherbrooke Forest in the Dandenong Ranges National
Park. Because of the park's higher elevation, the temperature dropped
well below the rest of Melbourne in winter. In summer, the mosquitoes
were unbearable and Mendax sometimes woke to find his face swollen and
bloated from their bites.</p>

<p id="id02504" class="calibre1">For six months after the AFP raid, Mendax didn't touch a computer.
Slowly, he started rebuilding his life from the ground up. By the time
the AFP's blue slips—carrying 29 charges—arrived in July 1994, he
was settled in a new house with his child. Throughout his period of
transition, he talked to Prime Suspect and Trax on the phone
regularly—as friends and fellow rebels, not fellow hackers. Prime
Suspect had been going through his own set of problems.</p>

<p id="id02505" class="calibre1">While he hacked, Prime Suspect didn't do many drugs. A little weed,
not much else. There was no time for drugs, girls, sports or anything
else. After the raid, he gave up hacking and began smoking more dope.
In April 1992, he tried ecstasy for the first time—and spent the next
nine months trying to find the same high. He didn't consider himself
addicted to drugs, but the drugs had certainly replaced his addiction
to hacking and his life fell into a rhythm.</p>

<p id="id02506" class="calibre1">Snort some speed or pop an ecstasy tablet on Saturday night. Go to a
rave. Dance all night, sometimes for six hours straight. Get home
mid-morning and spend Sunday coming down from the drugs. Get high on
dope a few times during the week, to dull the edges of desire for the
more expensive drugs. When Saturday rolled around, do it all over
again. Week in, week out. Month after month.</p>

<p id="id02507" class="calibre1">Dancing to techno-music released him. Dancing to it on drugs cleared
his mind completely, made him feel possessed by the music. Techno was
musical nihilism; no message, and not much medium either. Fast,
repetitive, computer-synthesised beats, completely stripped of vocals
or any other evidence of humanity. He liked to go to techno-night at
The Lounge, a city club, where people danced by themselves, or in
small, loose groups of four or five. Everyone watched the video screen
which provided an endless stream of ever-changing, colourful
computer-generated geometric shapes pulsing to the beat.</p>

<p id="id02508" class="calibre1">Prime Suspect never told his mother he was going to a rave. He just
said he was going to a friend's for the night. In between the drugs,
he attended his computer science courses at TAFE and worked at the
local supermarket so he could afford his weekly $60 ecstasy tablet,
$20 rave entry fee and regular baggy of marijuana.</p>

<p id="id02509" class="calibre1">Over time, the drugs became less and less fun. Then, one Sunday, he
came down off some speed hard. A big crash. The worst he had ever
experienced. Depression set in, and then paranoia. He knew the police
were still watching him. They had followed him before.</p>

<p id="id02510" class="calibre1">At his police interviews, he learned that an AFP officer had followed
him to an AC/DC concert less than two weeks before he had been busted.
The officer told him the AFP wanted to know what sort of friends Prime
Suspect associated with—and the officer had been treated to the spectre
of seven other arm-waving, head-thumping, screaming teenagers just like
Prime Suspect himself.</p>

<p id="id02511" class="calibre1">Now Prime Suspect believed that the AFP had started following him
again. They were going to raid him again, even though he had given up
hacking completely. It didn't make sense. He knew the premonition was
illogical, but he couldn't shake it.</p>

<p id="id02512" class="calibre1">Something bad—very, very bad—was going to happen any day. Overcome
with a great sense of impending doom, he lapsed into a sort of
hysterical depression. Feeling unable to prevent the advent of the
dark, terrible event which would tear apart his life yet again, he
reached out to a friend who had experienced his own personal problems.
The friend guided him to a psychologist at the Austin Hospital. Prime
Suspect decided that there had to be a better way to deal with his
problems than wasting himself every weekend. He began counselling.</p>

<p id="id02513" class="calibre1">The counselling made him deal with all sorts of unresolved business.
His father's death. His relationship with his mother. How he had
evolved into an introvert, and why he was never comfortable talking to
people. Why he hacked. How he became addicted to hacking. Why he took
up drugs.</p>

<p id="id02514" class="calibre1">At the end, the 21-year-old Prime Suspect emerged drug-free and,
though still shaky, on the road to recovery. The worst he had to wait
for were the charges from the AFP.</p>

<p id="id02515" class="calibre1">Trax's recovery from his psychological instabilities wasn't as
definitive. From 1985, Trax had suffered from panic attacks, but he
didn't want to seek professional help—he just ran away from the
problem. The situation only became worse after he was involved in a
serious car accident. He became afraid to leave the house at night. He
couldn't drive. Whenever he was in a car, he had to fight an
overwhelming desire to fling the door open and throw himself out on to
the road. In 1989, his local GP referred Trax to a psychiatrist, who
tried to treat the phreaker's growing anxiety attacks with hypnosis
and relaxation techniques.</p>

<p id="id02516" class="calibre1">Trax's illness degenerated into full-fledged agoraphobia, a fear of
open spaces. When he rang the police in late October 1991—just days
before the AFP raid—his condition had deteriorated to the point where
he could not comfortably leave his own house.</p>

<p id="id02517" class="calibre1">Initially he rang the state police to report a death threat made
against him by another phreaker. Somewhere in the conversation, he
began to talk about his own phreaking and hacking. He hadn't intended
to turn himself in but, well, the more he talked, the more he had to
say. So many things had been weighing on his mind. He knew that Prime
Suspect had probably been traced from NorTel as a result of Mendax's
own near miss in that system. And Prime Suspect and Mendax had been so
active, breaking into so many systems, it was almost as if they wanted
to be caught.</p>

<p id="id02518" class="calibre1">Then there was Prime Suspect's plan to write a destructive worm, which
would wipe systems en route. It wasn't really a plan per se, more just
an idea he had toyed with on the phone. Nonetheless, it had scared
Trax. He began to think all three IS hackers were getting in too deep
and he wanted out.</p>

<p id="id02519" class="calibre1">He tried to stop phreaking, even going so far as to ask Telecom to
change his telephone number to a new exchange which he knew would not
allow him to make untraceable calls. Trax reasoned that if he knew he
could be traced, he would stop phreaking and hacking.</p>

<p id="id02520" class="calibre1">For a period, he did stop. But the addiction was too strong, and
before long he was back at it again, regardless of the risk. He ran a
hidden cable from his sister's telephone line, which was on the old
exchange. His inability to stop made him feel weak and guilty, and
even more anxious about the risks. Perhaps the death threat threw him
over the edge. He couldn't really understand why he had turned himself
in to the police. It had just sort of happened.</p>

<p id="id02521" class="calibre1">The Victoria Police notified the AFP. The AFP detectives must have
been slapping their heads in frustration. Here was Australia's next
big hacker case after The Realm, and they had expected to make a clean
bust. They had names, addresses, phone numbers. They had jumped
through legal hoops to get a telephone tap. The tap was up and
running, catching every target computer, every plot, every word the
hackers said to each other. Then one of their targets goes and turns
himself in to the police. And not even to the right police—he goes to
the Victoria Police. In one fell swoop, the hacker was going to take
down the entire twelve-month Operation Weather investigation.</p>

<p id="id02522" class="calibre1">The AFP had to move quickly. If Trax tipped off the other two IS
hackers that he had called the police, they might destroy their notes,
computer files—all the evidence the AFP had hoped to seize in raids.</p>

<p id="id02523" class="calibre1">When the AFP swooped in on the three hackers, Mendax and Prime Suspect
had refused to be interviewed on the night. Trax, however, had spent
several hours talking to the police at his house.</p>

<p id="id02524" class="calibre1">He told the other IS hackers that the police had threatened to take
him down to AFP headquarters—despite the fact that they knew leaving
his house caused him anxiety. Faced with that prospect, made so
terrifying by his psychiatric illness, he had talked.</p>

<p id="id02525" class="calibre1">Prime Suspect and Mendax didn't know how much Trax had told the
police, but they didn't believe he would dob them in completely. Apart
from anything else, he hadn't been privy to much of his colleagues'
hacking. They hadn't tried to exclude Trax, but he was not as
sophisticated a hacker and therefore didn't share in many of their
exploits.</p>

<p id="id02526" class="calibre1">In fact, one thing Trax did tell the police was just how sophisticated
the other two IS hackers had become just prior to the bust. Prime
Suspect and Mendax were, he said, `hackers on a major scale, on a huge
scale—something never achieved before', and the AFP had sat up and
taken notice.</p>

<p id="id02527" class="calibre1">After the raids, Trax told Mendax that the AFP had tried to recruit
him as an informant. Trax said that they had even offered him a new
computer system, but he had been non-committal. And it seemed the AFP
was still keeping tabs on the IS hackers, Trax also told Mendax. The
AFP officers had heard Mendax had gone into hospital and they were
worried. There seemed to be a disturbing pattern evolving.</p>

<p id="id02528" class="calibre1">On the subject of the IS raids, Trax told Mendax that the AFP felt it
didn't have any choice. Their attitude was: you were doing so much, we
had to bust you. You were inside so many systems, it was getting out
of control.</p>

<p id="id02529" class="calibre1">In any case, by December 1991 Mendax had agreed to a police interview,
based on legal advice. Ken Day interviewed Mendax, and the hacker was
open with Day about what he had done. He refused, however, to
implicate either Trax or Prime Suspect. In February 1992, Prime
Suspect followed suit, with two interviews. He was also careful about
what he said regarding his fellow hackers. Mendax was interviewed a
second time, in February 1992, as was Trax in August.</p>

<p id="id02530" class="calibre1">After the raid, Trax's psychiatric condition remained unstable. He
changed doctors and began receiving home visits from a hospital
psychiatric service. Eventually, a doctor prescribed medication.</p>

<p id="id02531" class="calibre1">The three hackers continued to talk on the phone, and see each other
occasionally. One or the other might drop out of communication for a
period, but would soon return to the fold. They helped each other and
they maintained their deep anti-establishment sentiments.</p>

<p id="id02532" class="calibre1">After the charges arrived in the mail, they called each other to
compare notes. Mendax thought out loud on the phone to Prime Suspect,
`I guess I should get a lawyer'.</p>

<p id="id02533" class="calibre1">`Yeah. I got one. He's lining up a barrister too.'</p>

<p id="id02534" class="calibre1">`They any good?' Mendax asked.</p>

<p id="id02535" class="calibre1">`Dunno. I guess so. The solicitor works at Legal Aid, an in-house guy.<br class="calibre4"/>

I've only met them a few times.'<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02536" class="calibre1">`Oh,' Mendax paused. `What are their names?'</p>

<p id="id02537" class="calibre1">`John McLoughlin and Boris Kayser. They did Electron's case.'</p>

<p id="id02538" class="calibre1">Trax and Prime Suspect decided to plead guilty. Once they saw the
overwhelming evidence—data taps, telephone voice taps, data seized
during the raids, nearly a dozen statements by witnesses from the
organisations they had hacked, the 300-page Telecom report—they
figured they would be better off pleading. The legal brief ran to more
than 7000 pages. At least they would get some kudos with the judge for
cooperating in the police interviews and pleading early in the
process, thus saving the court time and money.</p>

<p id="id02539" class="calibre1">Mendax, however, wanted to fight the charges. He knew about Pad and<br class="calibre4"/>

Gandalf's case and the message from that seemed to be pretty clear:<br class="calibre4"/>

Plead and you go to prison, fight and you might get off free.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02540" class="calibre1">The DPP shuffled the charges around so much between mid-1994 and 1995
that all the original charges against Trax, issued on 20 July 1994,
were dropped in favour of six new charges filed on Valentines Day,
1995. At that time, new charges—largely for hacking a Telecom
computer—were also laid against Mendax and Prime Suspect.</p>

<p id="id02541" class="calibre1">By May 1995, the three hackers faced 63 charges in all: 31 for Mendax,
26 for Prime Suspect and six for Trax. In addition, NorTel claimed the
damages attributed to the hacker incident totalled about $160000—and
the company was seeking compensation from the responsible parties. The
Australian National University claimed another $4200 in damages.</p>

<p id="id02542" class="calibre1">Most of the charges related to obtaining illegal access to commercial
or other information, and inserting and deleting data in numerous
computers. The deleting of data was not malicious—it generally
related to cleaning up evidence of the hackers' activities. However,
all three hackers were also charged with some form of `incitement'. By
writing articles for the IS magazine, the prosecution claimed the
hackers had been involved in disseminating information which would
encourage others to hack and phreak.</p>

<p id="id02543" class="calibre1">On 4 May 1995 Mendax sat in the office of his solicitor, Paul<br class="calibre4"/>

Galbally, discussing the committal hearing scheduled for the next day.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02544" class="calibre1">Galbally was a young, well-respected member of Melbourne's most
prestigious law family. His family tree read like a Who's Who of the
law. Frank Galbally, his father, was one of Australia's most famous
criminal barristers. His uncle, Jack Galbally, was a well-known
lawyer, a minister in the State Labor government of John Cain Sr and,
later, the Leader of the Opposition in the Victorian parliament. His
maternal grandfather, Sir Norman O'Bryan, was a Supreme Court judge,
as was his maternal uncle of the same name. The Galballys weren't so
much a family of lawyers as a legal dynasty.</p>

<p id="id02545" class="calibre1">Rather than rest on his family's laurels, Paul Galbally worked out of
a cramped, 1970s time-warped, windowless office in a William Street
basement, where he was surrounded by defence briefs—the only briefs
he accepted. He liked the idea of keeping people out of prison better
than the idea of putting them in it. Working closely with a defendant,
he inevitably found redeeming qualities which the prosecution would
never see. Traces of humanity, no matter how small, made his choice
seem worthwhile.</p>

<p id="id02546" class="calibre1">His choices in life reflected the Galbally image as champions of the
underdog, and the family shared a background with the working class.
Catholic. Irish. Collingwood football enthusiasts. And, of course, a
very large family. Paul was one of eight children, and his father had
also come from a large family.</p>

<p id="id02547" class="calibre1">The 34-year-old criminal law specialist didn't know anything about
computer crime when Mendax first appeared in his office, but the
hacker's case seemed both interesting and worthy. The unemployed,
long-haired youth had explained he could only offer whatever fees the
Victorian Legal Aid Commission was willing to pay—a sentence Galbally
heard often in his practice. He agreed.</p>

<p id="id02548" class="calibre1">Galbally &amp; O'Bryan had a very good reputation as a criminal law firm.
Criminals, however, tended not to have a great deal of money. The
large commercial firms might dabble in some criminal work, but they
cushioned any resulting financial inconvenience with other, more
profitable legal work. Pushing paper for Western Mining Corporation
paid for glass-enclosed corner offices on the fiftieth floor.
Defending armed robbers and drug addicts didn't.</p>

<p id="id02549" class="calibre1">The 4 May meeting between Galbally and Mendax was only scheduled to
take an hour or so. Although Mendax was contesting the committal
hearing along with Prime Suspect on the following day, it was Prime
Suspect's barrister, Boris Kayser, who was going to be running the
show. Prime Suspect told Mendax he had managed to get full Legal Aid
for the committal, something Galbally and Mendax had not been able to
procure. Thus Mendax would not have his own barrister at the
proceedings.</p>

<p id="id02550" class="calibre1">Mendax didn't mind. Both hackers knew they would be committed to
trial. Their immediate objective was to discredit the prosecution's
damage claims—particularly NorTel's.</p>

<p id="id02551" class="calibre1">As Mendax and Galbally talked, the mood in the office was upbeat.
Mendax was feeling optimistic. Then the phone rang. It was Geoff
Chettle, the barrister representing the DPP. While Chettle talked,
Mendax watched a dark cloud pass across his solicitor's face. When he
finally put the phone down, Galbally looked at Mendax with his serious,
crisis management expression.</p>

<p id="id02552" class="calibre1">`What's wrong? What's the matter?' Mendax asked.</p>

<p id="id02553" class="calibre1">Galbally sighed before he spoke.</p>

<p id="id02554" class="calibre1">`Prime Suspect has turned Crown witness against you.'</p>

<p id="id02555" class="calibre1">There was a mistake. Mendax was sure of it. The whole thing was just
one big mistake. Maybe Chettle and the DPP had misunderstood something
Prime Suspect had said to them. Maybe Prime Suspect's lawyers had
messed up. Whatever. There was definitely a mistake.</p>

<p id="id02556" class="calibre1">At Galbally's office, Mendax had refused to believe Prime Suspect had
really turned. Not until he saw a signed statement. That night he told
a friend, `Well, we'll see. Maybe Chettle is just playing it up.'</p>

<p id="id02557" class="calibre1">Chettle, however, was not just playing it up.</p>

<p id="id02558" class="calibre1">There it was—a witness statement—in front of him. Signed by Prime<br class="calibre4"/>

Suspect.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02559" class="calibre1">Mendax stood outside the courtroom at Melbourne Magistrates Court trying
to reconcile two realities. In the first, there was one of Mendax's four
or five closest friends. A friend with whom he had shared his deepest
hacking secrets.  A friend he had been hanging out with only last week.</p>

<p id="id02560" class="calibre1">In the other reality, a six-page statement signed by Prime Suspect and
Ken Day at AFP Headquarters at 1.20 p.m. the day before. To compound
matters, Mendax began wondering if Prime Suspect may have been
speaking to the AFP for as long as six months.</p>

<p id="id02561" class="calibre1">The two realities were spinning through his head, dancing around each
other.</p>

<p id="id02562" class="calibre1">When Galbally arrived at the court, Mendax took him to one side to go
over the statement. From a damage-control perspective, it wasn't a
complete disaster. Prime Suspect certainly hadn't gone in hard. He
could have raised a number of matters, but didn't. Mendax had already
admitted to most of the acts which formed the basis of his 31 charges
in his police interview. And he had already told the police a good
deal about his adventures in Telecom's telephone exchanges.</p>

<p id="id02563" class="calibre1">However, Prime Suspect had elaborated on the Telecom break-ins in his
statement. Telecom was owned by the government, meaning the court
would view phreaking from their exchanges not as defrauding a company
but as defrauding the Commonwealth. Had the DPP decided to lay those
new charges—the Telecom charges—in February 1995 because Prime
Suspect had given the AFP a draft Crown witness statement back then?
Mendax began to suspect so. Nothing seemed beyond doubt any more.</p>

<p id="id02564" class="calibre1">The immediate crisis was the committal hearing in the Melbourne
Magistrates Court. There was no way Boris Kayser was now going to
decimate their star witness, a NorTel information systems
manager. Galbally would have to run a cross-examination himself—no easy
task at short notice, given the highly complex technical aspects of the
case.</p>

<p id="id02565" class="calibre1">Inside the courtroom, as Mendax got settled, he saw Prime Suspect. He
gave his former friend a hard, unblinking, intense stare. Prime
Suspect responded with a blank wall, then he looked away. In fact,
even if Mendax had wanted to say something, he couldn't. As a Crown
witness, Prime Suspect was off-limits until the case was over.</p>

<p id="id02566" class="calibre1">The lawyers began to file into the courtroom. The DPP representative,
Andrea Pavleka, breezed in, momentarily lifting the tension in the
windowless courtroom.</p>

<p id="id02567" class="calibre1">She had that effect on people. Tall, slender and long-legged, with a
bob of sandy blonde curls, booky spectacles resting on a cute button
nose and an infectious laugh, Pavleka didn't so much walk into a
courtroom as waft into it. She radiated happiness from her sunny face.
It's a great shame, Mendax thought, that she is on the other side.</p>

<p id="id02568" class="calibre1">The court was called into session. Prime Suspect stood in the dock and
pleaded guilty to 26 counts of computer crimes.</p>

<p id="id02569" class="calibre1">In the course of the proceedings his barrister, Boris Kayser, told the
court that his client had cooperated with the police, including
telling the AFP that the hackers had penetrated Telecom's exchanges.
He also said that Telecom didn't believe—or didn't want to
believe—that their exchanges had been compromised. When Kayser
professed loudly what a model citizen his client had been, Ken Day,
sitting in the public benches, quietly rolled his eyes.</p>

<p id="id02570" class="calibre1">The magistrate, John Tobin, extended Prime Suspect's bail. The hacker
would be sentenced at a later date.</p>

<p id="id02571" class="calibre1">That matter dealt with, the focus of the courtroom shifted to Mendax's
case. Geoff Chettle, for the prosecution, stood up, put the NorTel
manager, who had flown in from Sydney, on the stand and asked him some
warm-up questions.</p>

<p id="id02572" class="calibre1">Chettle could put people at ease—or rattle them—at will. Topped by a
minute stubble of hair, his weathered 40-something face provided a
good match to his deep, gravelly voice. With quick eyes and a hard,
no-nonsense manner, he lacked the pretentiousness of many barristers.
Perhaps because he didn't seem to give a fig about nineteenth century
protocols, he always managed to looked out of place in a barrister's
wig and robe. Every time he stood up, the black cape slid off his lean
shoulders. The barrister's wig went crooked. He continually adjusted
it—tugging the wig back into the correct spot like some wayward
child. In court, Chettle looked as if he wanted to tear off the crusty
trappings of his profession and roll up his sleeves before sinking
into a hearty debate. And he looked as if he would rather do it at a
pub or the footy.</p>

<p id="id02573" class="calibre1">The NorTel manager took the stand. Chettle asked him some questions
designed to show the court the witness was credible, in support of the
company's $160000 hacker-clean-up claim. His task accomplished,
Chettle sat down.</p>

<p id="id02574" class="calibre1">A little nervous, Paul Galbally stood up to his full height—more than
six feet—and straightened his jacket. Dressed in a moss green suit so
dark it was almost black, with thin lapels and a thin, 1960s style
tie, he looked about as understated hip as a lawyer could—and still
show his face in court.</p>

<p id="id02575" class="calibre1">Halting at first, Galbally appeared unsure of himself. Perhaps he had
lost his nerve because of the technical issues. WMTP files. UTMP
files. PACCT audits. Network architecture. IP addresses. He had been
expected to become an expert in the basics literally overnight. A
worried Mendax began passing him notes—questions to ask,
explanations, definitions. Slowly, Galbally started working up a
rhythm to the cross-examination.</p>

<p id="id02576" class="calibre1">During the questioning someone from the back of the court sidled up to
Mendax, in the front row of seats, and handed a note over his
shoulder. Mendax unfolded the note, read it and then turned around to
smile at the messenger. It was Electron.</p>

<p id="id02577" class="calibre1">By the time Galbally had finished, he had pulled apart much of the
NorTel manager's evidence. As he built up a head of steam quizzing the
witness, he forced the NorTel manager to admit he didn't know all that
much about the alleged hacking incidents. In fact, he wasn't even
employed by the company when they occurred. He had largely thrown
together an affidavit based on second-hand information—and it was
this affidavit which supposedly proved the hackers had cost the
company $160000. Worse, it seemed to an observer at court that the
NorTel manager had little Unix security technical expertise and
probably would not have been able to conduct a detailed technical
analysis of the incident even if he had been with the company in 1991.
By the end of the defence's cross-examination, it appeared that
Galbally knew more about Unix than the NorTel manager.</p>

<p id="id02578" class="calibre1">When Geoff Chettle stood up to re-examine the witness, the situation
was hopeless. The manager soon stood down. In Mendax's view, the
credibility of the NorTel Manager's statement was shot.</p>

<p id="id02579" class="calibre1">The court was then adjourned until 12 May.</p>

<p id="id02580" class="calibre1">After court, Mendax heard Geoff Chettle talking about the NorTel
witness. `That guy is OFF the team,' he said emphatically.</p>

<p id="id02581" class="calibre1">It was a mixed victory for Mendax. His solicitor had knocked off one
NorTel witness, but there were more where he came from. At a full
trial, the prosecution would likely fly in some real NorTel
fire-power, from Canada, where the 676-page security incident report
had been prepared by Clark Ferguson and other members of the NorTel
security team. Those witnesses would understand how a Unix system
operated, and would have first-hand knowledge of the hackers'
intrusions. It could make things much more difficult.</p>

<p id="id02582" class="calibre1">When Mendax returned to court a week later, he was committed to stand
trial in the County Court of Victoria, as expected.</p>

<p id="id02583" class="calibre1">Later, Mendax asked Galbally about his options. Take the case to full
trial, or plead guilty like the other two IS hackers. He wanted to
know where the DPP stood on his case. Would they go in hard if he
pleaded guilty? Had the NorTel manager disaster at the committal
hearing forced them to back down a little?</p>

<p id="id02584" class="calibre1">Paul sighed and shook his head. The DPP were standing firm. They
wanted to see Mendax go to prison.</p>

<p id="id02585" class="calibre1">Andrea Pavleka, the DPP's sunny-faced girl who radiated happiness, was
baying for blood.</p>

<p id="id02586" class="calibre5">One month later, on 21 July 1995, Prime Suspect arrived at the County<br class="calibre4"/>

Court for sentencing.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02587" class="calibre1">Rising early that morning to make sure his court suit was in order,
Prime Suspect had been tense. His mother cooked him a big breakfast.
Toast, bacon and eggs the way he liked it. In fact, his favourite
breakfast was an Egg McMuffin from McDonald's, but he never told his
mother that.</p>

<p id="id02588" class="calibre1">The courtroom was already crowded. Reporters from newspapers, the wire
services, a few TV channels. There were also other people, perhaps
waiting for another case.</p>

<p id="id02589" class="calibre1">Dressed in a dark pin-stripe suit, Ken Day stood tapping on a laptop
on the prosecution's side of the courtroom. Geoff Chettle sat near
him. Prime Suspect's barrister, Boris Kayser, sifted through some
papers on the other side.</p>

<p id="id02590" class="calibre1">Mendax lingered at the back of the room, watching his former friend.
He wanted to hear Prime Suspect's sentence because, under the rules of
parity sentencing, Mendax's own sentence would have to be similar to
that of his fellow hackers. However, Prime Suspect might get some
dispensation for having helped the prosecution.</p>

<p id="id02591" class="calibre1">A handful of Prime Suspect's friends—none of them from the computer
underground—trickled in. The hacker's mother chatted nervously with
them.</p>

<p id="id02592" class="calibre1">Court was called into session and everyone settled into their seats.
The first case, it turned out, was not Prime Suspect's. A tall,
silver-haired man in his mid-fifties, with eyes so blue they were
almost demonic, stepped into the dock. As the reporters began taking
notes, Prime Suspect tried to imagine what crime the polished,
well-dressed man had committed.</p>

<p id="id02593" class="calibre1">Child molesting.</p>

<p id="id02594" class="calibre1">The man had not just molested children, he had molested
his own son. In the parents' bedroom. Repeatedly. On Easter Sunday.
His son was less than ten years old at the time. The whole family had
collapsed. Psychologically scarred, his son had been too traumatised
even to give a victim impact statement.</p>

<p id="id02595" class="calibre1">For all of this, Judge Russell Lewis told the court, the man had shown
no remorse. Grave-faced, the judge sentenced him to a minimum prison
term of five years and nine months.</p>

<p id="id02596" class="calibre1">The court clerk then called Prime Suspect's case.</p>

<p id="id02597" class="calibre1">At the back of the courtroom, Mendax wondered at the strange
situation. How could the criminal justice system put a child molester
in the same category as a hacker? Yet, here they both were being
sentenced side by side in the same County Court room.</p>

<p id="id02598" class="calibre1">Boris Kayser had called a collection of witnesses, all of whom
attested to Prime Suspect's difficult life. One of these, the
well-regarded psychologist Tim Watson-Munro, described Prime Suspect's
treatments at the Austin Hospital and raised the issue of reduced
free-will. He had written a report for the court.</p>

<p id="id02599" class="calibre1">Judge Lewis was quick to respond to the suggestion that hacking was an
addiction. At one point, he wondered aloud to the courtroom whether
some of Prime Suspect's hacking activities were `like a shot of
heroin'.</p>

<p id="id02600" class="calibre1">Before long, Kayser had launched into his usual style of courtroom
address. First, he criticised the AFP for waiting so long to charge
his client.</p>

<p id="id02601" class="calibre1">`This fellow should have been dealt with six to twelve months after
being apprehended. It is a bit like the US, where a man can commit a
murder at twenty, have his appeal be knocked back by the Supreme Court
at 30 and be executed at 40—all for something he did when he was only
twenty years old.</p>

<p id="id02602" class="calibre1">Thoroughly warmed up, Kayser observed that 20 per cent of Prime
Suspect's life had gone by since being raided. Then he began hitting
his high notes.</p>

<p id="id02603" class="calibre1">`This young man received no assistance in the maturation process. He
didn't grow up, he drifted up.</p>

<p id="id02604" class="calibre1">`His world was so horrible that he withdrew into a fantasy world. He
knew no other way to interact with human beings. Hacking was like a
physical addiction to him.</p>

<p id="id02605" class="calibre1">`If he hadn't withdrawn into the cybernetic highway, what would he
have done instead? Set fires? Robbed houses? Look at the name he gave
himself. Prime Suspect. It has implied power—a threat. This kid
didn't have any power in his life other than when he sat down at a
computer.'</p>

<p id="id02606" class="calibre1">Not only did Kayser want the judge to dismiss the idea of prison or
community service, he was asking him to order no recorded conviction.</p>

<p id="id02607" class="calibre1">The prosecution lawyers looked at Kayser as if he was telling a good
joke. The AFP had spent months tracking these hackers and almost three
years preparing the case against them. And now this barrister was
seriously suggesting that one of the key players should get off
virtually scot-free, with not so much as a conviction recorded against
him? It was too much.</p>

<p id="id02608" class="calibre1">The judge retired to consider the sentence. When he returned, he was
brief and to the point. No prison. No community service. The recording
of 26 convictions. A $500 three-year good behaviour bond. Forfeiture
of the now ancient Apple computer seized by police in the raid. And a
reparation payment to the Australian National University of $2100.</p>

<p id="id02609" class="calibre1">Relief passed over Prime Suspect's face, pink and sweaty from the
tension. His friends and family smiled at each other.</p>

<p id="id02610" class="calibre1">Chettle then asked the judge to rule on what he called `the
cooperation point'. He wanted the judge to say that Prime Suspect's
sentence was less than it would have been because the hacker had
turned Crown witness. The DPP was shoring up its position with regard
to its remaining target—Mendax.</p>

<p id="id02611" class="calibre1">Judge Lewis told the court that the cooperation in this case made no
difference. At the back of the court, Mendax felt suddenly sad. It was
good news for him, but somehow it felt like a hollow victory.</p>

<p id="id02612" class="calibre1">Prime Suspect has destroyed our friendship, he thought, and all for
nothing.</p>

<p id="id02613" class="calibre1">Two months after Prime Suspect's sentencing, Trax appeared in another
County Court room to receive his sentence after pleading guilty to six
counts of hacking and phreaking. Despite taking medication to keep his
anxiety under control while in the city, he was still very nervous in
the dock.</p>

<p id="id02614" class="calibre1">Since he faced the least number of charges of any of the IS hackers,
Trax believed he had a shot at no recorded conviction. Whether or not
his lawyer could successfully argue the case was another matter.
Bumbling through papers he could never seem to organise, Trax's lawyer
rambled to the court, repeated the same points over and over again,
jumping all over the place in his arguments. His voice was a
half-whispered rasp—a fact which so annoyed the judge that he sternly
instructed the lawyer to speak up.</p>

<p id="id02615" class="calibre1">Talking informally before court, Geoff Chettle had told Mendax that in
his view there was no way Judge Mervyn Kimm would let Trax off with no
recorded conviction. Judge Kimm was considered to be one tough nut to
crack. If you were a bookmaker running bets on his court at a
sentencing hearing, the good money would be on the prosecution's side.</p>

<p id="id02616" class="calibre1">But on 20 September 1995, the judge showed he couldn't be predicted
quite so easily. Taking everything into account, including Prime
Suspect's sentence and Trax's history of mental illness, he ordered no
conviction be recorded against Trax. He also ordered a $500 three-year
good behaviour bond.</p>

<p id="id02617" class="calibre1">In passing sentence, Judge Kimm said something startlingly insightful
for a judge with little intimate knowledge of the hacker psyche. While
sternly stating that he did not intend to make light of the gravity of
the offences, he told the court that `the factors of specific
deterrence and general deterrence have little importance in the
determination of the sentence to be imposed'. It was perhaps the first
time an Australian judge had recognised that deterrence had little
relevance at the point of collision between hacking and mental
illness.</p>

<p id="id02618" class="calibre1">Trax's sentence was also a good outcome for Mendax, who on
29 August 1995 pleaded guilty to eight counts of computer crime, and
not guilty to all the other charges. Almost a year later, on 9 May
1996, he pleaded guilty to an additional eleven charges, and not
guilty to six. The prosecution dropped all the other charges.</p>

<p id="id02619" class="calibre1">Mendax wanted to fight those six outstanding charges, which involved
ANU, RMIT, NorTel and Telecom, because he felt that the law was on his
side in these instances. In fact, the law was fundamentally unclear
when it came to those charges. So much so that the DPP and the defence
agreed to take issues relating to those charges in a case stated to
the Supreme Court of Victoria.</p>

<p id="id02620" class="calibre1">In a case stated, both sides ask the Supreme Court to make a ruling
not on the court case itself, but on a point of law. The defence and
the prosecution hammer out an agreed statement about the facts of the
case and, in essence, ask the Supreme Court judges to use that
statement as a sort of case study. The resulting ruling is meant to
clarify the finer points of the law not only for the specific case,
but for similar cases which appear in future.</p>

<p id="id02621" class="calibre1">Presenting a case stated to the Supreme Court is somewhat uncommon. It
is unusual to find a court case where both sides can agree on enough
of the facts, but Mendax's hacking charges presented the perfect case
and the questions which would be put to the Victorian Supreme Court in
late 1996 were crucial for all future hacking cases in Australia. What
did it mean `to obtain access' to a computer? Did someone obtain
access if he or she got in without using a password? What if he or she
used the username `guest' and the password `guest'?</p>

<p id="id02622" class="calibre1">Perhaps the most crucial question of all was this: does a person
`obtain access' to data stored in a computer if he or she has the
ability to view the data, but does not in fact view or even attempt to
view that data?</p>

<p id="id02623" class="calibre1">A good example of this applied to the aggravated versions of the
offence of hacking: viewing commercial information. If, for example,
Mendax logged into a NorTel computer, which contained commercially
sensitive information, but he didn't actually read any of those files,
would he be guilty of `obtaining access' or `obtaining access to
commercial information'?</p>

<p id="id02624" class="calibre1">The chief judge of the County Court agreed to the case stated and sent
it up to the full bench of the Supreme Court. The lawyers from both
sides were pleased with the bench—Justices Frank Vincent, Kenneth
Hayne and John Coldrey.</p>

<p id="id02625" class="calibre1">On 30 September 1996, Mendax arrived at the Supreme Court and found
all the lawyers assembled at the court—all except for his barrister.
Paul Galbally kept checking his watch as the prosecution lawyers began
unpacking their mountains of paper—the fruit of months of
preparation. Galbally paced the plush carpet of the Supreme Court
anteroom. Still no barrister.</p>

<p id="id02626" class="calibre1">Mendax's barrister had worked tirelessly, preparing for the case
stated as if it was a million dollar case. Combing through legal
precedents from not only Australia, the UK and the US, but from all
the world's Western-style democracies, he had attained a great
understanding of the law in the area of computer crime. He had finally
arrived at that nexus of understanding between law, philosophy and
linguistics which many lesser lawyers spent their entire careers
trying to reach.</p>

<p id="id02627" class="calibre1">But where was he? Galbally pulled out his mobile and checked in with
his office for what seemed like the fifth time in as many minutes. The
news he received was bad. He was told, through second-hand sources,
that the barrister had collapsed in a state of nervous exhaustion. He
wouldn't be making it to court.</p>

<p id="id02628" class="calibre1">Galbally could feel his hairs turning grey.</p>

<p id="id02629" class="calibre1">When court opened, Galbally had to stand up and explain to three of
the most senior judges in Australia why the defence would like a
two-day adjournment. A consummate professional, Geoff Chettle
supported the submission. Still, it was a difficult request. Time in
the Supreme Court is a scarce and valuable thing. Fortunately, the
adjournment was granted.</p>

<p id="id02630" class="calibre1">This gave Galbally exactly two days in which to find a barrister who
was good, available and smart enough to assimilate a massive amount of
technical information in a short time. He found Andrew Tinney.</p>

<p id="id02631" class="calibre1">Tinney worked around the clock and by Wednesday, 2 October, he was
ready. Once again, all the lawyers, and the hacker, gathered at the
court.</p>

<p id="id02632" class="calibre1">This time, however, it was the judges who threw a spanner into the
works. They asked both sides to spend the first hour or so explaining
exactly why the Supreme Court should hear the case stated at all. The
lawyers looked at each other in surprise. What was this all about?</p>

<p id="id02633" class="calibre1">After hearing some brief arguments from both sides, the judges retired
to consider their position. When they returned, Justice Hayne read a
detailed judgment saying, in essence, that the judges refused to hear
the case.</p>

<p id="id02634" class="calibre1">As the judge spoke, it became clear that the Supreme Court judges
weren't just refusing to hear this case stated; they were virtually
refusing to hear any case stated in future. Not for computer crimes.
Not for murder. Not for fraud. Not for anything. They were sending a
message to the County Court judges: don't send us a case stated except
in exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p id="id02635" class="calibre1">Geoff Chettle slumped in his chair, his hands shielding his face. Paul
Galbally looked stunned. Andrew Tinney looked as if he wanted to leap
from his chair shouting, `I just killed myself for the past two days
on this case! You have to hear it!' Even Lesley Taylor, the quiet,
unflappable and inscrutable DPP solicitor who had replaced Andrea
Pavleka on the case, looked amazed.</p>

<p id="id02636" class="calibre1">The ruling had enormous implications. Judges from the lower courts
would be loath to ever send cases to the Supreme Court for
clarification on points of law again. Mendax had made legal history,
but not in the way he had hoped.</p>

<p id="id02637" class="calibre1">Mendax's case passed back down to the County Court.</p>

<p id="id02638" class="calibre1">He had considered taking his case to trial, but with recently
announced budget cuts to Legal Aid, he knew there was little hope of
receiving funding to fight the charges. The cuts were forcing the poor
to plead guilty, leaving justice available only for the wealthy.
Worse, he felt the weight of pleading guilty, not only as a sense of
injustice in his own case, but for future hacking cases which would
follow. Without clarity on the meaning of the law—which the judges
had refused to provide—or a message from a jury in a landmark case,
such as Wandii's trial, Mendax believed that hackers could expect
little justice from either the police or the courts in the future.</p>

<p id="id02639" class="calibre1">On 5 December 1996, Mendax pleaded guilty to the remaining six charges
and was sentenced on all counts.</p>

<p id="id02640" class="calibre1">Court Two was quiet that day. Geoff Chettle, for the prosecution,
wasn't there. Instead, the quietly self-possessed Lesley Taylor
handled the matter. Paul Galbally appeared for Mendax himself. Ken Day
sat, expressionless, in the front row of the public benches. He looked
a little weary. A few rows back, Mendax's mother seemed nervous.
Electron slipped silently into the back of the room and gave Mendax a
discreet smile.</p>

<p id="id02641" class="calibre1">His hair pulled back into a loose ponytail, Mendax blinked and rolled
his eyes several times as if brought from a dark space into the
bright, white-walled courtroom.</p>

<p id="id02642" class="calibre1">Judge Ross, a ruddy-faced and jowly man of late middle age with bushy,
grey eyebrows, seated himself in his chair. At first, he was reluctant
to take on the case for sentencing. He thought it should be returned
to one of the original judges—Judge Kimm or Judge Lewis. When he
walked into court that morning, he had not read the other judges'
sentences.</p>

<p id="id02643" class="calibre1">Lesley Taylor summarised the punishments handed down to the other two
hackers. The judge did not look altogether pleased. Finally, he
announced he would deal with the case. `Two judges have had a crack at
it, why not a third one? He might do it properly.'</p>

<p id="id02644" class="calibre1">Galbally was concerned. As the morning progressed, he became
increasingly distressed; things were not going well. Judge Ross made
clear that he personally favoured a custodial sentence, albeit a
suspended one. The only thing protecting Mendax seemed to be the
principle of parity in sentencing. Prime Suspect and Trax had
committed similar crimes to Mendax, and therefore he had to be given a
similar sentence.</p>

<p id="id02645" class="calibre1">Ross `registered some surprise' at Judge Lewis's disposition toward
the sentencing of Prime Suspect. In the context of parity, he told
Leslie Taylor, he was at times `quite soured by some penalties'
imposed by other judges. He quizzed her for reasons why he might be
able to step outside parity.</p>

<p id="id02646" class="calibre1">He told the court that he had not read the telephone intercepts in the
legal brief. In fact, he had `only read the summary of facts' and when
Taylor mentioned `International Subversive', he asked her, `What was
that?'</p>

<p id="id02647" class="calibre1">Then he asked her how to spell the word `phreak'.</p>

<p id="id02648" class="calibre1">Later that day, after Judge Ross had read the other judges' sentences,
he gave Mendax a sentence similar to Prime Suspect's—a recorded
conviction on all counts, a reparation payment of $2100 to ANU and a
three-year good behaviour bond.</p>

<p id="id02649" class="calibre1">There were two variations. Prime Suspect and Trax both received $500
good behaviour bonds; Judge Ross ordered a $5000 bond for Mendax.
Further, Judge Lewis had given Prime Suspect almost twelve months to
pay his $2100 reparation. Judge Ross ordered Mendax to pay within
three months.</p>

<p id="id02650" class="calibre1">Judge Ross told Mendax, `I repeat what I said before. I thought
initially that these were offences which justified a jail sentence, but
the mitigatory circumstances would have converted that to a suspended
sentence. The sentence given to your co-offender caused me to alter that
view, however.' He was concerned, he said, `that highly intelligent
individuals ought not to behave like this and I suspect it is only
highly intelligent individuals who can do what you did'.</p>

<p id="id02651" class="calibre1">The word `addiction' did not appear anywhere in the sentencing
transcript.</p>

<h5 id="id02652" class="calibre9">                   Chapter 10 — Anthrax — The Outsider.</h5>

<p id="id02653" class="calibre2">They had a gun at my head and a knife at my back; Don't wind me up too tight.</p>

<p id="id02654" class="calibre1">— from `Powderworks' (also called The Blue Album).</p>

<p id="id02655" class="calibre1">Anthrax didn't like working as part of a team. He always considered
other people to be the weakest link in the chain.</p>

<p id="id02656" class="calibre1">Although people were never to be trusted completely, he socialised
with many hackers and phreakers and worked with a few of them now and
again on particular projects. But he never formed intimate
partnerships with any of them. Even if a fellow hacker dobbed him in
to the police, the informant couldn't know the full extent of his
activities. The nature of his relationships was also determined, in
part, by his isolation. Anthrax lived in a town in rural Victoria.</p>

<p id="id02657" class="calibre1">Despite the fact that he never joined a hacking partnership like The
Realm, Anthrax liked people, liked to talk to them for hours at a time
on the telephone. Sometimes he received up to ten international calls
a day from his phreaker friends overseas. He would be over at a
friend's house, and the friend's mother would knock on the door of the
bedroom where the boys were hanging out, listening to new music,
talking.</p>

<p id="id02658" class="calibre1">The mother would poke her head in the door, raise an eyebrow and point
at Anthrax. `Phone call for you. Someone from Denmark.' Or sometimes
it was Sweden. Finland. The US. Wherever. Though they didn't say
anything, his friends' parents thought it all a bit strange. Not many
kids in country towns got international calls trailing them around
from house to house. But then not many kids were master phreakers.</p>

<p id="id02659" class="calibre1">Anthrax loved the phone system and he understood its power. Many
phreakers thought it was enough to be able to call their friends
around the globe for free. Or make hacking attack phone calls without
being traced. However, real power for Anthrax lay in controlling voice
communications systems—things that moved conversations around the
world. He cruised through people's voice mailbox messages to piece
together a picture of what they were doing. He wanted to be able to
listen into telephone conversations. And he wanted to be able to
reprogram the telephone system, even take it down. That was real
power, the kind that lots of people would notice.</p>

<p id="id02660" class="calibre1">The desire for power grew throughout Anthrax's teenage years. He ached
to know everything, to see everything, to play with exotic systems in
foreign countries. He needed to know the purpose of every system, what
made them tick, how they fitted together. Understanding how things
worked would give him control.</p>

<p id="id02661" class="calibre1">His obsession with telephony and hacking began early in life. When he
was about eleven, his father had taken him to see the film War Games.
All Anthrax could think of as he left the theatre was how much he
wanted to learn how to hack. He had already developed a fascination
for computers, having received the simplest of machines, a Sinclair
ZX81 with 1 k of memory, as a birthday present from his parents.
Rummaging through outdoor markets, he found a few second-hand books on
hacking. He read Out of the Inner Circle by Bill Landreth, and Hackers
by Steven Levy.</p>

<p id="id02662" class="calibre1">By the time he was fourteen, Anthrax had joined a Melbourne-based
group of boys called The Force. The members swapped Commodore 64 and
Amiga games. They also wrote their own demos—short computer
programs—and delighted in cracking the copy protections on the games
and then trading them with other crackers around the world. It was
like an international penpal group. Anthrax liked the challenge
provided by cracking the protections, but few teenagers in his town
shared an interest in his unusual hobby. Joining The Force introduced
him to a whole new world of people who thought as he did.</p>

<p id="id02663" class="calibre1">When Anthrax first read about phreaking he wrote to one of his American
cracking contacts asking for advice on how to start. His friend sent him
a list of AT&amp;T calling card numbers and a toll-free direct-dial number
which connected Australians with American operators. The card numbers
were all expired or cancelled, but Anthrax didn't care. What captured
his imagination was the fact that he could call an operator all the way
across the Pacific for free. Anthrax began trying to find more special
numbers.</p>

<p id="id02664" class="calibre1">He would hang out at a pay phone near his house. It was a seedy
neighbourhood, home to the most downtrodden of all the town's
residents, but Anthrax would stand at the pay phone for hours most
evenings, oblivious to the clatter around him, hand-scanning for
toll-free numbers. He dialled 0014—the prefix for the international
toll-free numbers—followed by a random set of numbers. Then, as he
got more serious, he approached the task more methodically. He
selected a range of numbers, such as 300 to 400, for the last three
digits. Then he dialled over and over, increasing the number by one
each time he dialled. 301. 302. 303. 304. Whenever he hit a
functioning phone number, he noted it down. He never had to spend a
cent since all the 0014 numbers were free.</p>

<p id="id02665" class="calibre1">Anthrax found some valid numbers, but many of them had modems at the
other end. So he decided it was time to buy a modem so he could explore
further. Too young to work legally, he lied about his age and landed an
after-school job doing data entry at an escort agency. In the meantime,
he spent every available moment at the pay phone, scanning and adding
new numbers to his growing list of toll-free modem and operator-assisted
numbers.</p>

<p id="id02666" class="calibre1">The scanning became an obsession. Often Anthrax stayed at the phone
until 10 or 11 p.m. Some nights it was 3 a.m. The pay phone had a
rotary dial, making the task laborious, and sometimes he would come
home with blisters on the tips of his fingers.</p>

<p id="id02667" class="calibre1">A month or so after he started working, he had saved enough money for
a modem.</p>

<p id="id02668" class="calibre1">Hand scanning was boring, but no more so than school. Anthrax attended
his state school regularly, at least until year 10. Much of that was
due to his mother's influence. She believed in education and in
bettering oneself, and she wanted to give her son the opportunities
she had been denied. It was his mother, a psychiatric nurse, who
scrimped and saved for months to buy him his first real computer, a
$400 Commodore 64. And it was his mother who took out a loan to buy
the more powerful Amiga a few years later in 1989. She knew the boy
was very bright. He used to read her medical textbooks, and computers
were the future.</p>

<p id="id02669" class="calibre1">Anthrax had always done well in school, earning distinctions every
year from year 7 to year 10. But not in maths. Maths bored him. Still,
he had some aptitude for it. He won an award in year 6 for designing a
pendulum device which measured the height of a building using basic
trigonometry—a subject he had never studied. However, Anthrax didn't
attend school so much after year 10. The teachers kept telling him
things he already knew, or things he could learn much faster from
reading a book. If he liked a topic, he wandered off to the library to
read about it.</p>

<p id="id02670" class="calibre1">Things at home became increasingly complicated around that time. His
family had struggled from the moment they arrived in Australia from
England, when Anthrax was about twelve. They struggled financially,
they struggled against the roughness of a country town, and, as
Indians, Anthrax, his younger brother and their mother struggled
against racism.</p>

<p id="id02671" class="calibre1">The town was a violent place, filled with racial hatred and ethnic
tension. The ethnics had carved out corners for themselves, but
incursions into enemy territory were common and almost always resulted
in violence. It was the kind of town where people ended up in fist
fights over a soccer game. Not an easy place for a half-Indian,
half-British boy with a violent father.</p>

<p id="id02672" class="calibre1">Anthrax's father, a white Englishman, came from a farming family. One
of five sons, he attended an agricultural college where he met and
married the sister of an Indian student on a scholarship. Their
marriage caused quite a stir, even making the local paper under the
headline `Farmer Marries Indian Woman'. It was not a happy marriage
and Anthrax often wondered why his father had married an Indian.
Perhaps it was a way of rebelling against his dominating father.
Perhaps he had once been in love. Or perhaps he simply wanted someone
he could dominate and control. Whatever the reason, the decision was
an unpopular one with Anthrax's grandfather and the mixed-race family
was often excluded from larger family gatherings.</p>

<p id="id02673" class="calibre1">When Anthrax's family moved to Australia, they had almost no money.
Eventually, the father got a job as an officer at Melbourne's
Pentridge prison, where he stayed during the week. He only received a
modest income, but he seemed to like his job. The mother began working
as a nurse. Despite their new-found financial stability, the family
was not close. The father appeared to have little respect for his wife
and sons, and Anthrax had little respect for his father.</p>

<p id="id02674" class="calibre1">As Anthrax entered his teenage years, his father became increasingly
abusive. On weekends, when he was home from work, he used to hit
Anthrax, sometimes throwing him on the floor and kicking him. Anthrax
tried to avoid the physical abuse but the scrawny teenager was little
match for the beefy prison officer. Anthrax and his brother were quiet
boys. It seemed to be the path of least resistance with a rough father
in a rough town. Besides, it was hard to talk back in the painful
stutter both boys shared through their early teens.</p>

<p id="id02675" class="calibre1">One day, when Anthrax was fifteen, he came home to find a commotion at
his house. On entering the house, Anthrax went to his parents'
bedroom. He found his mother there, and she was very upset and
emotionally distressed. He couldn't see his father anywhere, but found
him relaxing on the sofa in the lounge room, watching TV.</p>

<p id="id02676" class="calibre1">Disgust consumed Anthrax and he retreated into the kitchen. When his
father came in not long after to prepare some food Anthrax watched his
back with revulsion. Then he noticed a carving knife resting on the
counter. As Anthrax reached for the knife, an ambulance worker
appeared in the doorway. Anthrax put the knife down and walked away.</p>

<p id="id02677" class="calibre1">But he wasn't so quiet after that. He started talking back, at home and
at school, and that marked the beginning of the really big problems. In
primary school and early high school he had been beaten up now and
again. Not any more. When a fellow student hauled Anthrax up against the
wall of the locker shed and started shaking him and waving his fist,
Anthrax lost it. He saw, for a moment, his father's face instead of the
student's and began to throw punches in a frenzy that left his victim in
a terrible state.</p>

<p id="id02678" class="calibre1">At home, Anthrax's father learned how to bait his son. The bully
always savours a morsel of resistance from the victim, which makes
going in for the kill a little more fun. Talking back gave the father
a good excuse to get violent. Once he nearly broke his son's neck.
Another time it was his arm. He grabbed Anthrax and twisted his arm
behind his back. There was an eerie sound of cracking cartilage, and
then pain. Anthrax screamed for his father to stop. His father twisted
Anthrax's arm harder, then pressed on his neck. His mother shrieked at
her husband to let go of her son. He wouldn't.</p>

<p id="id02679" class="calibre1">`Look at you crying,' his father sneered. `You disgusting animal.'</p>

<p id="id02680" class="calibre1">`You're the disgusting animal,' Anthrax shouted, talking back again.</p>

<p id="id02681" class="calibre1">His father threw Anthrax on the floor and began kicking him in the
head, in the ribs, all over.</p>

<p id="id02682" class="calibre1">Anthrax ran away. He went south to Melbourne for a week, sleeping
anywhere he could, in the empty night-time spaces left over by day
workers gone to orderly homes. He even crashed in hospital emergency
rooms. If a nurse asked why he was there, he would answer politely, `I
received a phone call to meet someone here'. She would nod her head
and move on to someone else.</p>

<p id="id02683" class="calibre1">Eventually, when Anthrax returned home, he took up martial arts to
become strong. And he waited.</p>

<p id="id02684" class="calibre2">Anthrax was poking around a MILNET gateway when he stumbled on the
door to System X.* He had wanted to find this system for months,
because he had intercepted email about it which had aroused his
curiosity.</p>

<p id="id02685" class="calibre1">Anthrax telnetted into the gateway. A gateway binds two different
networks. It allows, for example, two computer networks which talk
different languages to communicate. A gateway might allow someone on a
system running DECNET to login to a TCP/IP based system, like a Unix.
Anthrax was frustrated that he couldn't seem to get past the System X
gateway and on to the hosts on the other side.</p>

<p id="id02686" class="calibre1">Using normal address formats for a variety of networks, he tried
telling the gateway to make a connection. X.25. TCP/IP. Whatever lay
beyond the gateway didn't respond. Anthrax looked around until he
found a sample of addresses in a help file. None of them worked, but
they offered a clue as to what format an address might take.</p>

<p id="id02687" class="calibre1">Each address had six digits, the first three numbers of which
corresponded to telephone area codes in the Washington DC area. So he
picked one of the codes and started guessing the last three digits.</p>

<p id="id02688" class="calibre1">Hand scanning was a pain, as ever, but if he was methodical and
persistent, something should turn up. 111. 112. 113. 114. 115. On it
went. Eventually he connected to something—a Sunos Unix system—which
gave him a full IP address in its login message. Now that was handy.
With the full IP address, he could connect to System X again through
the Internet directly—avoiding the gateway if he chose to. It's
always helpful in covering your tracks to have a few different routing
options. Importantly, he could approach System X through more than
just its front door.</p>

<p id="id02689" class="calibre1">Anthrax spiralled through the usual round of default usernames and
passwords. Nothing. This system required a more strategic attack.</p>

<p id="id02690" class="calibre1">He backed out of the login screen, escaped from the gateway and went
to another Internet site to have a good look at System X from a
healthy distance. He `fingered' the site, pulling up any bit of
information System X would release to the rest of the Internet when
asked. He probed and prodded, looking for openings. And then he found
one. Sendmail.</p>

<p id="id02691" class="calibre1">The version of Sendmail run by System X had a security hole Anthrax
could exploit by sending himself a tiny backdoor program. To do this,
he used System X's mail-processing service to send a `letter' which
contained a tiny computer program. System X would never have allowed
the program to run normally, but this program worked like a letter
bomb. When System X opened the letter, the program jumped out and
started running. It told System X that anyone could connect to port
2001—to an interactive shell—of the computer without using a
password.</p>

<p id="id02692" class="calibre1">A port is a door to the outside world. TCP/IP computers use a standard
set of ports for certain services. Port 25 for mail. Port 79 for
Finger. Port 21 for FTP. Port 23 for Telnet. Port 513 for Rlogin. Port
80 for the World Wide Web. A TCP/IP based computer system has 65535
ports but most of them go unused. Indeed, the average Unix box uses
only 35, leaving the remaining 65500 ports sitting idle. Anthrax
simply picked one of these sleepy ports, dusted off the cobwebs and
plugged in using the backdoor created by his tiny mail-borne program.</p>

<p id="id02693" class="calibre1">Connecting directly to a port created some problems, because the
system wouldn't recognise certain keystrokes from the port, such as
the return key. For this reason, Anthrax had to create an account for
himself which would let him telnet to the site and login like any
normal user. To do this, he needed root privileges in order to create
an account and, ultimately, a permanent backdoor into the system.</p>

<p id="id02694" class="calibre1">He began hunting for vulnerabilities in System X's security. There was
nothing obvious, but he decided to try out a bug he had successfully
used elsewhere. He had first learned about it on an international
phone conference, where he had traded information with other hackers
and phreakers. The security hole involved the system's relatively
obscure load-module program. The program added features to the running
system but, more importantly, it ran as root, meaning that it had a
free run on the system when it was executed. It also meant that any
other programs the load-module program called up also ran as root. If
Anthrax could get this program to run one of his own programs—a
little Trojan—he could get root on System X.</p>

<p id="id02695" class="calibre1">The load-module bug was by no means a sure thing on System X. Most
commercial systems—computers run by banks or credit agencies, for
example—had cleaned up the load-module bug in their Sunos computers
months before. But military systems consistently missed the bug. They
were like turtles—hard on the outside, but soft and vulnerable on the
inside. Since the bug couldn't be exploited unless a hacker was
already inside a system, the military's computer security officials
didn't seem to pay much attention to it. Anthrax had visited a large
number of military systems prior to System X, and in his experience
more than 90 per cent of their Sunos computers had never fixed the
bug.</p>

<p id="id02696" class="calibre1">With only normal privileges, Anthrax couldn't force the load-module
program to run his backdoor Trojan program. But he could trick it into
doing so. The secret was in one simple keyboard character: /.</p>

<p id="id02697" class="calibre1">Unix-based computer systems are a bit like the protocols of the
diplomatic corps; the smallest variation can change something's
meaning entirely. Hackers, too, understand the implications of subtle
changes.</p>

<p id="id02698" class="calibre1">A Unix-based system reads the phrase:</p>

<p id="id02699" class="calibre1">/bin/program</p>

<p id="id02700" class="calibre1">very differently from:</p>

<p id="id02701" class="calibre1">bin program</p>

<p id="id02702" class="calibre1">One simple character—the `/'—makes an enormous difference. A Unix
computer reads the `/' as a road sign. The first phrase tells the
computer, `Follow the road to the house of the user called "bin" and
when you get there, go inside and fetch the file called "program" and
run it'. A blank space, however, tells the computer something quite
different. In this case, Anthrax knew it told the computer to execute
the command which proceeded the space. That second phrase told the
machine, `Look everywhere for a program called "bin" and run it'.</p>

<p id="id02703" class="calibre1">Anthrax prepared for his attack on the load-module program by
installing his own special program, named `bin', into a temporary
storage area on System X. If he could get System X to run his program
with root privileges, he too would have procured root level access to
the system. When everything was in place, Anthrax forced the system to
read the character `/' as a blank space. Then he ran the load-module
program, and watched. When System X hunted around for a program named
`bin', it quickly found Anthrax's Trojan and ran it.</p>

<p id="id02704" class="calibre1">The hacker savoured the moment, but he didn't pause for long. With a
few swift keystrokes, he added an entry to the password file, creating
a basic account for himself. He exited his connection to port 2001,
circled around through another route, using the 0014 gateway, and
logged into System X using his newly created account. It felt good
walking in through the front door.</p>

<p id="id02705" class="calibre1">Once inside, Anthrax had a quick look around. The system startled him.
There were only three human users. Now that was definitely odd. Most
systems had hundreds of users. Even a small system might serve 30 or
40 people, and this was not a small system. He concluded that System X
wasn't just some machine designed to send and receive email. It was
operational. It did something.</p>

<p id="id02706" class="calibre1">Anthrax considered how to clean up his footsteps and secure his
position. While he was hardly broadcasting his presence, someone might
discover his arrival simply by looking at who was logged in on the
list of accounts in the password file. He had given his backdoor root
account a bland name, but he could reasonably assume that these three
users knew their system pretty well. And with only three users, it was
probably the kind of system that had lots of babysitting. After all
that effort, Anthrax needed a watchful nanny like a hole in the head.
He worked at moving into the shadows.</p>

<p id="id02707" class="calibre1">He removed himself from the WTMP and UTMP files, which listed who had
been on-line and who was still logged in. Anthrax wasn't invisible,
but an admin would have to look closely at the system's network
connections and list of processes to find him. Next stop: the login
program.</p>

<p id="id02708" class="calibre1">Anthrax couldn't use his newly created front-door account for an
extended period—the risk of discovery was too great. If he accessed
the computer repeatedly in this manner, a prying admin might
eventually find him and delete his account. An extra account on a
system with only three users was a dead give-away. And losing access
to System X just as things were getting interesting was not on his
agenda.</p>

<p id="id02709" class="calibre1">Anthrax leaned back in his chair and stretched his shoulders. His
hacking room was an old cloakroom, though it was barely recognisable
as such. It looked more like a closet—a very messy closet. The whole
room was ankle-deep in scrap papers, most of them with lists of
numbers on the back and front. Occasionally, Anthrax scooped up all
the papers and piled them into heavy-duty garbage bags, three of which
could just fit inside the room at any one time. Anthrax always knew
roughly where he had `filed' a particular set of notes. When he needed
it, he tipped the bag onto the floor, searched through the mound and
returned to the computer. When the sea of paper reached a critical
mass, he jammed everything back into the garbage bag again.</p>

<p id="id02710" class="calibre1">The computer—an Amiga 500 box with a cheap Panasonic TV as the
monitor—sat on a small desk next to his mother's sewing machine
cabinet. The small bookcase under the desk
was stuffed with magazines like Compute and Australian Communications,
along with a few Commodore, Amiga and Unix reference manuals. There
was just enough space for Anthrax's old stereo and his short-wave
radio. When he wasn't listening to his favourite show, a hacking
program broadcast from a pirate station in Ecuador, he tuned into
Radio Moscow or the BBC's World Service.</p>

<p id="id02711" class="calibre1">Anthrax considered what to do with System X. This system had aroused
his curiosity and he intended to visit it frequently.</p>

<p id="id02712" class="calibre1">It was time to work on the login patch. The patch replaced the
system's normal login program and had a special feature: a master
password. The password was like a diplomatic passport. It would let
him do anything, go anywhere. He could login as any user using the
master password. Further, when he logged in with the master password,
he wouldn't show up on any log files—leaving no trail. But the beauty
of the login patch was that, in every other way, it ran as the normal
login program. The regular computer users—all three of them—could
login as usual with their passwords and would never know Anthrax had
been in the system.</p>

<p id="id02713" class="calibre1">He thought about ways of setting up his login patch. Installing a
patch on System X wasn't like mending a pair of jeans. He couldn't
just slap on a swath from an old bandanna and quick-stitch it in with
a thread of any colour. It was more like mending an expensive cashmere
coat. The fabric needed to be a perfect match in colour and texture.
And because the patch required high-quality invisible mending, the
size also needed to be just right.</p>

<p id="id02714" class="calibre1">Every file in a computer system has three dates: the date it was
created, the date it was last modified and the date it was last
accessed. The problem was that the login patch needed to have the same
creation and modification dates as the original login program so that
it would not raise suspicions. It wasn't hard to get the dates but it
was difficult to paste them onto the patch. The last access date
wasn't important as it changed whenever the program was run
anyway—whenever a user of the System X logged in.</p>

<p id="id02715" class="calibre1">If Anthrax ripped out the original login program and stitched his
patch in its place, the patch would be stamped with a new creation
date. He knew there was no way to change a creation date short of
changing the clock for the whole system—something which would cause
problems elsewhere in System X.</p>

<p id="id02716" class="calibre1">The first thing a good system admin does when he or she suspects a
break-in is search for all files created or modified over the previous
few days. One whiff of an intruder and a good admin would be all over
Anthrax's login patch within about five minutes.</p>

<p id="id02717" class="calibre1">Anthrax wrote the modification and creation dates down on a bit of
paper. He would need those in a moment. He also jotted down the size
of the login file.</p>

<p id="id02718" class="calibre1">Instead of tearing out the old program and sewing in a completely new
one, Anthrax decided to overlay his patch by copying it onto the top
of the old program. He uploaded his own login patch, with his master
password encased inside it, but he didn't install it yet. His patch
was called `troj'—short for Trojan. He typed:</p>

<p id="id02719" class="calibre1">cat&lt;troj&gt;/bin/login</p>

<p id="id02720" class="calibre1">The cat command told the computer: `go get the data in the file called
"troj" and put it in the file "/bin/login"'. He checked the piece of
paper where he had scribbled down the original file's creation and
modification dates, comparing them to the new patch. The creation date
and size matched the original. The modification date was still wrong,
but he was two-thirds of the way home.</p>

<p id="id02721" class="calibre1">Anthrax began to fasten down the final corner of the patch by using a
little-known feature of the command:</p>

<p id="id02722" class="calibre1">/usr/5bin/date</p>

<p id="id02723" class="calibre1">Then he changed the modification date of his login patch to the
original login file's date.</p>

<p id="id02724" class="calibre1">He stepped back to admire his work from a distance. The newly
installed patch matched the original perfectly. Same size. Same
creation date. Same modification date. With patch in place, he deleted
the root account he had installed while visiting port 2001. Always
take your garbage with you when you leave.</p>

<p id="id02725" class="calibre1">Now for the fun bit. Snooping around. Anthrax headed off for the
email, the best way to work out what a system was used for. There were
lots of reports from underlings to the three system users on buying
equipment, progress reports on a certain project, updates. What was
this project?</p>

<p id="id02726" class="calibre1">Then Anthrax came across a huge directory. He opened it and there,
couched inside, were perhaps 100 subdirectories. He opened one of
them. It was immense, containing hundreds of files. The smallest
subfile had perhaps 60 computer screens' worth of material, all of it
unintelligible. Numbers, letters, control codes. Anthrax couldn't make
head nor tail of the files. It was as if he was staring at a group of
binary files. The whole subdirectory was filled with thousands of
pages of mush. He thought they looked like data files for some
database.</p>
