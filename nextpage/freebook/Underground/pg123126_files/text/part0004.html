    This is it, Par thought. I'm screwed. No way out of here now. Months
on the run only to get done in a hick town in North Carolina. These
guys are gonna haul my ass away for good. I'll never see the light of
day again. Elimination is the only option.</p>

<p id="id00864" class="calibre1">While these thoughts raced through Par's mind, he stood rigid, his
feet glued to the cement floor, his face locked into the probing gaze
of the Secret Service agent. He felt like they were the only two
people who existed in the universe.</p>

<p id="id00865" class="calibre1">Then, inexplicably, the agent looked away. He swivelled around to
finish his conversation with another agent. It was as if he had never
even seen the fugitive.</p>

<p id="id00866" class="calibre1">Par stood, suspended and unbelieving. Somehow it seemed impossible. He
began to edge the rest of the way to his motel room. Slowly, casually,
he slid inside and shut the door behind him.</p>

<p id="id00867" class="calibre1">His mind raced back to the photos of Theorem and he searched the room
for a safe hiding place. There wasn't one. The best option was
something above eye-level. He pulled a chair across the room, climbed
on it and pressed on the ceiling. The rectangular panel of
plasterboard lifted easily and Par slipped the photos in the space,
then replaced the panel. If the agents tore the room apart, they would
likely find the pictures. But the photos would probably escape a quick
search, which was the best he could hope for at this stage.</p>

<p id="id00868" class="calibre1">Next, he turned his mind to escaping. The locals were pretty cool
about everything, and Par thought he could count on the staff not to
mention his presence to the Secret Service. That bought him some time,
but he couldn't get out of the room without being seen. Besides, if he
was spotted walking off the property, he would certainly be stopped
and questioned.</p>

<p id="id00869" class="calibre1">Even if he did manage to get out of the motel grounds, it wouldn't
help much. The town wasn't big enough to shield him from a thorough
search and there was no-one there he trusted enough to hide him. It
might look a little suspicious, this young man running away from the
motel on foot in a part of the world where everyone travelled by car.
Hitchhiking was out of the question. With his luck, he'd probably get
picked up by one of the agents leaving the raid. No, he wanted a more
viable plan. What he really needed was to get out of the area
altogether, to flee the state.</p>

<p id="id00870" class="calibre1">Par knew that John travelled to Asheville to attend classes and that
he left very early. If the authorities had been watching the motel for
a while, they would know that his 5 a.m. departure was normal. And
there was one other thing about the early departure which seemed
promising. It was still dark at that hour.</p>

<p id="id00871" class="calibre1">If Par could get as far as Asheville, he might be able to get a lift
to Charlotte, and from there he could fly somewhere far away.</p>

<p id="id00872" class="calibre1">Par considered the options again and again. Hiding out in the motel
room seemed the most sensible thing to do. He had been moving rooms
around the motel pretty regularly, so he might have appeared to be
just another traveller to anyone watching the motel. With any luck the
Secret Service would be concentrating their search on the chalet,
ripping the place apart in a vain hunt for the computer equipment. As
these thoughts went through his head, the phone rang, making Par jump.
He stared at it, wondering whether to answer.</p>

<p id="id00873" class="calibre1">He picked it up.</p>

<p id="id00874" class="calibre1">`It's Nibbler,' a voice whispered.</p>

<p id="id00875" class="calibre1">`Yeah,' Par whispered back.</p>

<p id="id00876" class="calibre1">`Par, the Secret Service is here, searching the motel.'</p>

<p id="id00877" class="calibre1">`I know. I saw them.'</p>

<p id="id00878" class="calibre1">`They've already searched the room next to yours.' Par nearly died.
The agents had been less than two metres from where he was standing
and he hadn't even known it. That room was where John stayed. It was
connected to his by an inner door, but both sides were locked.</p>

<p id="id00879" class="calibre1">`Move into John's room and lay low. Gotta go.' Nibbler hung up
abruptly.</p>

<p id="id00880" class="calibre1">Par put his ear to the wall and listened. Nothing. He unlocked the
connecting inner door, turned the knob and pressed lightly. It gave.
Someone had unlocked the other side after the search. Par squinted
through the crack in the door. The room was silent and still. He
opened itâ€”no-one home. Scooping up his things, he quickly moved into
John's room.</p>

<p id="id00881" class="calibre1">Then he waited. Pacing and fidgeting, he strained his ears to catch
the sounds outside. Every bang and creak of a door opening and closing
set him on edge. Late that night, after the law enforcement officials
had left, Nibbler called him on the house phone and told him what had
happened.</p>

<p id="id00882" class="calibre1">Nibbler had been inside the computer chalet when the Secret Service
showed up with a search warrant. The agents took names, numbers, every
detail they could, but they had trouble finding any evidence of
hacking. Finally, one of them emerged from the chalet triumphantly
waving a single computer disk in the air. The law enforcement
entourage hanging around in front of the chalet let out a little
cheer, but Nibbler could hardly keep a straight face. His younger
brother had been learning the basics of computer graphics with a
program called Logo. The United States Secret Service would soon be
uncovering the secret drawings of a primary school student.</p>

<p id="id00883" class="calibre1">Par laughed. It helped relieve the stress. Then he told Nibbler his
escape plan, and Nibbler agreed to arrange matters. His parents didn't
know the whole story, but they liked Par and wanted to help him. Then
Nibbler wished his friend well.</p>

<p id="id00884" class="calibre1">Par didn't even try to rest before his big escape. He was as highly
strung as a racehorse at the gate. What if the Secret Service was
still watching the place? There was no garage attached to the main
motel building which he could access from the inside. He would be
exposed, even though it would only be for a minute or so. The night
would provide reasonable cover, but the escape plan wasn't fool-proof.
If agents were keeping the motel under observation from a distance
they might miss him taking off from his room. On the other hand, there
could be undercover agents posing as guests watching the entire
complex from inside their room.</p>

<p id="id00885" class="calibre1">Paranoid thoughts stewed in Par's mind throughout the night. Just
before 5 a.m., he heard John's car pull up outside. Par flicked off
the light in his room, opened his door a crack and scanned the motel
grounds. All quiet, bar the single car, which puffed and grunted in
the still, cold air. The windows in most of the buildings were dark.
It was now or never.</p>

<p id="id00886" class="calibre1">Par opened the door all the way and slipped down the hallway. As he
crept downstairs, the pre-dawn chill sent a shiver down his spine.
Glancing quickly from side to side, he hurried toward the waiting car,
pulled the back door open and dove onto the seat. Keeping his head
down, he twisted around, rolled onto the floor and closed the door
with little more than a soft click.</p>

<p id="id00887" class="calibre1">As the car began to move. Par reached for a blanket which had been
tossed on the floor and pulled it over himself. After a while, when
John told him they were safely out of the town, Par slipped the
blanket off his face and he looked up at the early morning sky. He
tried to get comfortable on the floor. It was going to be a long ride.</p>

<p id="id00888" class="calibre1">At Asheville, John dropped Par off at an agreed location. Par thanked
him and hopped into a waiting car. Someone else from his extensive
network of friends and acquaintances took him to Charlotte.</p>

<p id="id00889" class="calibre1">This time Par rode in the front passenger seat. For the first time, he
saw the true extent of the damage wreaked by Hurricane Hugo. The small
town where he had been staying had been slashed by rain and high
winds, but on the way to the Charlotte airport, where he would pick up
a flight to New York, Par watched the devastation with amazement. He
stared out the car window, unable to take his eyes off the storm's
trail of havoc.</p>

<p id="id00890" class="calibre1">The hurricane had swept up anything loose or fragile and turned it
into a missile on a suicide mission. Whatever mangled, broken
fragments remained after the turbulent winds had passed would have
been almost unrecognisable to those who had seen them before.</p>

<p id="id00891" class="calibre2">Theorem worried about Par as he staggered from corner to corner of the
continent. In fact, she had often asked him to consider giving himself
up. Moving from town to town was taking its toll on Par, and it wasn't
that much easier on Theorem. She hadn't thought going on the lam was
such a great idea in the first place, and she offered to pay for his
lawyer so he could stop running. Par declined. How could he hand
himself in when he believed elimination was a real possibility?
Theorem sent him money, since he had no way of earning a living and he
needed to eat. The worst parts, though, were the dark thoughts that
kept crossing her mind. Anything could happen to Par between phone
calls. Was he alive? In prison? Had he been raided, even accidentally
shot during a raid?</p>

<p id="id00892" class="calibre1">The Secret Service and the private security people seemed to want him
so badly. It was worrying, but hardly surprising. Par had embarrassed
them. He had broken into their machines and passed their private
information around in the underground. They had raided his home when
he wasn't even home. Then he had escaped a second raid, in North
Carolina, slipping between their fingers. He was constantly in their
face, continuing to hack blatantly and to show them contempt in things
such as his voicemail message. He figured they were probably
exasperated from chasing all sorts of false leads as well, since he
was perpetually spreading fake rumours about his whereabouts. Most of
all, he thought they knew what he had seen inside the TRW system. He
was a risk.</p>

<p id="id00893" class="calibre1">Par became more and more paranoid, always watching over his shoulder
as he moved from city to city. He was always tired. He could never
sleep properly, worrying about the knock on the door. Some mornings,
after a fitful few hours of rest, he woke with a start, unable to
remember where he was. Which house or motel, which friends, which
city.</p>

<p id="id00894" class="calibre1">He still hacked all the time, borrowing machines where he could. He
posted messages frequently on The Phoenix Project, an exclusive BBS
run by The Mentor and Erik Bloodaxe and frequented by LOD members and
the Australian hackers. Some well-known computer security people were
also invited onto certain, limited areas of the Texas-based board,
which immediately elevated the status of The Phoenix Project in the
computer underground. Hackers were as curious about the security
people as the security people were about their prey. The Phoenix
Project was special because it provided neutral ground, where both
sides could meet to exchange ideas.</p>

<p id="id00895" class="calibre1">Via the messages, Par continued to improve his hacking skills while
also talking with his friends, people like Erik Bloodaxe, from Texas,
and Phoenix, from The Realm in Melbourne. Electron also frequented The
Phoenix Project. These hackers knew Par was on the run, and sometimes
they joked with him about it. The humour made the stark reality of
Par's situation bearable. All the hackers on The Phoenix Project had
considered the prospect of being caught. But the presence of Par, and
his tortured existence on the run, hammered the implications home with
some regularity.</p>

<p id="id00896" class="calibre1">As Par's messages became depressed and paranoid, other hackers tried
to do what they could to help him. Elite US and foreign hackers who
had access to the private sections of The Phoenix Project saw his
messages and they felt for him. Yet Par continued to slide deeper and
deeper into his own strange world.</p>

<p id="id00967" class="calibre1">Between these strange messages, Par often posted comments on technical
matters. Other hackers routinely asked him questions about X.25
networks. Unlike some hackers, Par almost always offered some help. In
fact, he believed that being `one of the teachers' made him a
particular target. But his willingness to teach others so readily,
combined with his relatively humble, self-effacing demeanour, made Par
popular among many hackers. It was one reason he found so many places
to stay.</p>

<p id="id00968" class="calibre1">Spring arrived, brushing aside a few of the hardships of a winter on
the run, then summer. Par was still on the run, still dodging the
Secret Service's national hunt for the fugitive. By autumn, Par had
eluded law enforcement officials around the United States for more
than a year. The gloom of another cold winter on the run sat on the
horizon of Par's future, but he didn't care. Anything, everything was
bearable. He could take anything Fate would dish up because he had
something to live for.</p>

would be the same with Theorem. Within a few hours of her arrival, his
fears were assuaged. Theorem felt as passionately about him as she had
in California more than twelve months before. His own feelings were
even stronger. Theorem was a liferaft of happiness in the growing
turmoil of his life.</p>

<p id="id00972" class="calibre1">But things were different in the outside world. Life on the run with
Theorem was grim. Constantly dependent on other people, on their
charity, they were also subject to their petty whims.</p>

<p id="id00973" class="calibre1">A room-mate in the share-house got very drunk one night and picked a
fight with one of Par's friends. It was a major row and the friend
stormed out. In a fit of intoxicated fury, the drunk threatened to
turn Par in to the authorities. Slurring his angry words, he announced
he was going to call the FBI, CIA and Secret Service to tell them all
where Par was living.</p>

<p id="id00974" class="calibre1">Par and Theorem didn't want to wait around to see if the drunk would
be true to his word. They grabbed their coats and fled into the
darkness. With little money, and no place else to stay, they walked
around for hours in the blistering, cold wind. Eventually they decided
they had no choice but to return to the house late at night, hopefully
after the drunk had fallen asleep.</p>

<p id="id00975" class="calibre1">They sidled up to the front of the house, alert and on edge. It was
quite possible the drunk had called every law enforcement agency his
blurry mind could recall, in which case a collection of agents would
be lying in wait. The street was deadly quiet. All the parked cars
were deserted. Par peered in a darkened window but he couldn't see
anything. He motioned for Theorem to follow him into the house.</p>

<p id="id00976" class="calibre1">Though she couldn't see Par's face, Theorem could feel his tension.
Most of the time, she revelled in their closeness, a proximity which
at times seemed to border on telepathy. But at this moment, the
extraordinary gift of empathy felt like a curse. Theorem could feel
Par's all-consuming paranoia, and it filled her with terror as they
crept through the hall, checking each room. Finally they reached Par's
room, expecting to find two or three Secret Service agents waiting
patiently for them in the dark.</p>

<p id="id00977" class="calibre1">It was empty.</p>

<p id="id00978" class="calibre1">They climbed into bed and tried to get some sleep, but Theorem lay
awake in the dark for a little while, thinking about the strange and
fearful experience of returning to the house. Though she spoke to Par
on the phone almost every day when they were apart, she realised she
had missed something.</p>

<p id="id00979" class="calibre1">Being on the run for so long had changed Par.</p>

<p id="id00980" class="calibre1">Some time after she returned to Switzerland, Theorem's access to Altos
shrivelled up and died. She had been logging in through her old
university account but the university eventually killed her access
since she was no longer a student. Without access to any X.25 network
linked to the outside world, she couldn't logon to Altos. Although she
was never involved with hacking, Theorem had become quite addicted to
Altos. The loss of access to the Swiss X.25 networkâ€”and therefore to
Altosâ€”left her feeling very depressed. She told Par over the
telephone, in sombre tones.</p>

<p id="id00981" class="calibre1">Par decide to make a little present for Theorem. While most hackers
broke into computers hanging off the X.25 networks, Par broke into the
computers of the companies which ran the X.25 networks. Having control
over the machines owned by Telenet or Tymnet was real power. And as the
master of X.25 networks, Par could simply create a special accountâ€”just
for Theoremâ€”on Tymnet.</p>

<p id="id00982" class="calibre1">When Par finished making the account, he leaned back in his chair
feeling pretty pleased with himself.</p>

<p id="id00983" class="calibre1">Account name: Theorem.</p>

<p id="id00984" class="calibre1">Password: ParLovesMe!</p>

<p id="id00985" class="calibre1">Well, thought Par, she's going to have to type that in every time she
gets on the Tymnet network. Altos might be filled with the world's
best hackers, and they might even try to flirt with Theorem, but
she'll be thinking of me every time she logs on, he thought.</p>

<p id="id00986" class="calibre1">Par called her on the telephone and gave her his special present. When
he told her the password to her new account, Theorem laughed. She
thought it was sweet.</p>

<p id="id00987" class="calibre1">And so did the MOD boys.</p>

<p id="id00988" class="calibre1">Masters of Deception, or Destructionâ€”it depended on who told the
storyâ€”was a New York-based gang of hackers. They thought it would be
cool to hack Altos. It wasn't that easy to get Altos shell access,
which Theorem had, and most people had to settle for using one of the
`guest' accounts. But it was much easier to hack Altos from a shell
account than from a `guest' account. Theorem's account would be the
targeted jump-off point.</p>

<p id="id00989" class="calibre1">How did MOD get Theorem's Altos password? Most probably they were
watching one of the X.25 gateways she used as she passed through
Tymnet on her way to Altos. Maybe the MOD boys sniffed her password en
route. Or maybe they were watching the Tymnet security officials who
were watching that gateway.</p>

<p id="id00990" class="calibre1">In the end it didn't matter how MOD got Theorem's password on Altos.
What mattered was that they changed her password. When Theorem
couldn't get into Altos she was beside herself. She felt like a junkie
going cold turkey. It was too much. And of course she couldn't reach
Par. Because he was on the run, she had to wait for him to call her.
In fact she couldn't reach any of her other friends on Altos to ask
for help. How was she going to find them? They were all hackers. They
chose handles so no-one would know their real names.</p>

<p id="id00991" class="calibre1">What Theorem didn't know was that, not only had she lost access to
Altos, but the MOD boys were using her account to hack the Altos
system. To the outside world it appeared as though she was doing it.</p>

<p id="id00992" class="calibre1">Theorem finally managed to get a third-hand message to Gandalf, a
well-known British hacker. She sought him out for two reasons. First,
he was a good friend and was therefore likely to help her out. Second,
Gandalf had root access on Altos, which meant he could give her a new
password or account.</p>

<p id="id00993" class="calibre1">Gandalf had established quite a reputation for himself in the computer
underground through the hacking group 8lgmâ€”The Eight-Legged Groove
Machine, named after a British band. He and his friend, fellow British
hacker Pad, had the best four legs in the chorus line. They were a
world-class act, and certainly some of the best talent to come out of
the British hacking scene. But Gandalf and, to a lesser extent, Pad
had also developed a reputation for being arrogant. They rubbed some
of the American hackers the wrong way. Not that Pad and Gandalf seemed
to care. Their attitude was: We're good. We know it. Bugger off.</p>

<p id="id00994" class="calibre1">Gandalf disabled Theorem's account on Altos. He couldn't very well
just change the password and then send the new one through the
extended grapevine that Theorem had used to get a message through to
him. Clearly, someone had targeted her account specifically. No way
was he going to broadcast a new password for her account throughout
the underground. But the trouble was that neither Par nor Theorem knew
what Gandalf had done.</p>

<p id="id00995" class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Par called Theorem and got an earful. An angry Par vowed to
find out just who the hell had been messing with her account.</p>

<p id="id00996" class="calibre1">When the MOD boys told Par they were the culprits, he was a bit
surprised because he had always been on good terms with them. Par told
them how upset Theorem had been, how she gave him an earful. Then an
extraordinary thing happened. Corrupt, the toughest, baddest guy in
MOD, the black kid from the roughest part of New York, the hacker who
gave shit to everyone because he could, apologised to Par.</p>

<p id="id00997" class="calibre1">The MOD guys never apologised, even when they knew they were in the
wrong. Apologies never got anyone very far on a New York City street.
It was an attitude thing. `I'm sorry, man' from Corrupt was the
equivalent of a normal person licking the mud from the soles of your
shoes.</p>

<p id="id00998" class="calibre1">The new password was: M0Dm0dM0D. That's the kind of guys they were.</p>

<p id="id00999" class="calibre1">Par was just signing off to try out the new password when Corrupt
jumped in.</p>

<p id="id01000" class="calibre1">`Yeah, and ah, Par, there's something you should know.'</p>

<p id="id01001" class="calibre1">`Yeah?' Par answered, anxious to go.</p>

<p id="id01002" class="calibre1">`I checked out her mail. There was some stuff in it.'</p>

<p id="id01003" class="calibre1">Theorem's letters? Stuff? `What kind of stuff?' he asked.</p>

<p id="id01004" class="calibre1">`Letters from Gandalf.'</p>

<p id="id01005" class="calibre1">`Yeah?'</p>

<p id="id01006" class="calibre1">`Friendly letters. Real friendly.'</p>

<p id="id01007" class="calibre1">Par wanted to know, but at the same time, he didn't. He could have
arranged root access on Altos long ago if he'd really wanted it. But
he didn't. He didn't want it because it would mean he could access
Theorem's mail. And Par knew that if he could, he would. Theorem was
popular on Altos and, being the suspicious type, Par knew he would
probably take something perfectly innocent and read it the wrong way.
Then he would get in a fight with Theorem, and their time together was
too precious for that.</p>

<p id="id01008" class="calibre1">`Too friendly,' Corrupt went on. It must have been hard for him to
tell Par. Snagging a friend's girlfriend's password and breaking into
her account was one thing. There wasn't much wrong with that. But
breaking that kind of news, well, that was harsh. Especially since
Corrupt had worked with Gandalf in 8lgm.</p>

<p id="id01009" class="calibre1">`Thanks,' Par said finally. Then he took off.</p>

<p id="id01010" class="calibre1">When Par tried out the MOD password, it didn't work of course, because
Gandalf had disabled the account. But Par didn't know that. Finding
out that Theorem's account was disabled didn't bother him, but
discovering who disabled it for her didn't make Par all that happy.
Still, when he confronted Theorem, she denied that anything was going
on between her and Gandalf.</p>

<p id="id01011" class="calibre1">What could Par do? He could believe Theorem or he could doubt her.
Believing her was hard, but doubting her was painful. So he chose to
believe her.</p>

<p id="id01012" class="calibre1">The incident made Theorem take a long look at Altos. It was doing bad
things to her life. In the days that she was locked out of the German
chat system, she had made the unpleasant discovery that she was
completely addicted. And she didn't like it at all. Staring at her
life with fresh eyes, she realised she had been ignoring her friends
and her life in Switzerland. What on earth was she doing, spending
every night in front of a computer screen?</p>

<p id="id01013" class="calibre1">So Theorem made a tough decision.</p>

<p id="id01014" class="calibre1">She decided to stop using Altos forever.</p>

<p id="id01015" class="calibre2">Bad things seemed to happen to The Parmaster around Thanksgiving.</p>

<p id="id01016" class="calibre1">In late November 1991, Par flew up from Virginia Beach to New York. An
acquaintance named Morty Rosenfeld, who hung out with the MOD hackers
a bit, had invited him to come for a visit. Par thought a trip to the
City would do him good.</p>

<p id="id01017" class="calibre1">Morty wasn't exactly Par's best friend, but he was all right. He had
been charged by the Feds a few months earlier for selling a password
to a credit record company which resulted in credit card fraud. Par
didn't go in for selling passwords, but to each his own. Morty wasn't
too bad in the right dose. He had a place on Coney Island, which was
hardly the Village in Manhattan, but close enough, and he had a
fold-out sofa bed. It beat sleeping on the floor somewhere else.</p>

<p id="id01018" class="calibre1">Par hung out with a Morty and a bunch of his friends, drinking and
goofing around on Morty's computer.</p>

<p id="id01019" class="calibre1">One morning, Par woke up with a vicious hangover. His stomach was
growling and there was nothing edible in the fridge, so he rang up and
ordered pork fried rice from a Chinese take-away. Then he threw on
some clothes and sat on the end of the sofa-bed, smoking a cigarette
while he waited. He didn't start smoking until he was nineteen, some
time late into his second year on the run. It calmed his nerves.</p>

<p id="id01020" class="calibre1">There was a knock at the front door. Par's stomach grumbled in
response. As he walked toward the front door, he thought Pork Fried
Rice, here I come. But when Par opened the front door, there was
something else waiting for him.</p>

<p id="id01021" class="calibre1">The Secret Service.</p>

<p id="id01022" class="calibre1">Two men. An older, distinguished gentleman standing on the left and a
young guy on the right. The young guy's eyes opened wide when he saw
Par.</p>

<p id="id01023" class="calibre1">Suddenly, the young guy pushed Par, and kept pushing him. Small, hard,
fast thrusts. Par couldn't get his balance. Each time he almost got
his footing, the agent shoved the hacker backward again until he
landed against the wall. The agent spun Par around so his face pressed
against the wall and pushed a gun into his kidney. Then he slammed
handcuffs on Par and started frisking him for weapons.</p>

<p id="id01024" class="calibre1">Par looked at Morty, now sobbing in the corner, and thought, You
narced on me.</p>

<p id="id01025" class="calibre1">Once Par was safely cuffed, the agents flashed their badges to him.
Then they took him outside, escorted him into a waiting car and drove
into Manhattan. They pulled up in front of the World Trade Center and
when Par got out the young agent swapped the cuffs so Par's hands were
in front of him.</p>

<p id="id01026" class="calibre1">As the agents escorted the handcuffed fugitive up a large escalator,
the corporate world stared at the trio. Business men and women in prim
navy suits, secretaries and office boys all watched wide-eyed from the
opposite escalator. And if the handcuffs weren't bad enough, the
younger Secret Service agent was wearing a nylon jacket with a
noticeable gun-shaped lump in the front pouch.</p>

<p id="id01027" class="calibre1">Why are these guys bringing me in the front entrance? Par kept
thinking. Surely there must be a backdoor, a car park back entrance.
Something not quite so public.</p>

<p id="id01028" class="calibre1">The view from any reasonably high floor of the World Trade Center is
breathtaking, but Par never got a chance to enjoy the vista. He was
hustled into a windowless room and handcuffed to a chair. The agents
moved in and out, sorting out paperwork details. They uncuffed him
briefly while they inked his fingers and rolled them across sheets of
paper. Then they made him give handwriting samples, first his right
hand then his left.</p>

<p id="id01029" class="calibre1">Par didn't mind being cuffed to the chair so much, but he found the
giant metal cage in the middle of the fingerprinting room deeply
disturbing. It reminded him of an animal cage, the kind used in old
zoos.</p>

<p id="id01030" class="calibre1">The two agents who arrested him left the room, but another one came
in. And the third agent was far from friendly. He began playing the
bad cop, railing at Par, shouting at him, trying to unnerve him. But
no amount of yelling from the agent could rile Par as much as the
nature of the questions he asked.</p>

<p id="id01031" class="calibre1">The agent didn't ask a single question about Citibank. Instead, he
demanded to hear everything Par knew about TRW.</p>

<p id="id01032" class="calibre1">All Par's worst nightmares about the killer spy satellite, about
becoming the man who knew too much, rushed through his mind.</p>

<p id="id01033" class="calibre1">Par refused to answer. He just sat silently, staring at the agent.</p>

<p id="id01034" class="calibre1">Eventually, the older agent came back into the room, dragged the
pitbull agent away and took him outside for a whispered chat. After
that, the pitbull agent was all sweetness and light with Par. Not
another word about TRW.</p>

<p id="id01035" class="calibre1">Par wondered why a senior guy from the Secret Service would tell his
minion to clam up about the defence contractor? What was behind the
sudden silence? The abrupt shift alarmed Par almost as much as the
questions had in the first place.</p>

<p id="id01036" class="calibre1">The agent told Par he would be remanded in custody while awaiting
extradition to California. After all the paperwork had been completed,
they released him from the handcuffs and let him stand to stretch. Par
asked for a cigarette and one of the agents gave him one. Then a
couple of other agentsâ€”junior guysâ€”came in.</p>

<p id="id01037" class="calibre1">The junior agents were very friendly. One of them even shook Par's
hand and introduced himself. They knew all about the hacker. They knew
his voice from outgoing messages on voicemail boxes he had created for
himself. They knew what he looked like from his California police
file, and maybe even surveillance photos. They knew his personality
from telephone bridge conversations which had been recorded and from
the details of his Secret Service file. Perhaps they had even tracked
him around the country, following a trail of clues left in his
flightpath. Whatever research they had done, one thing was clear.
These agents felt like they knew him intimatelyâ€”Par the person, not
just Par the hacker.</p>

<p id="id01038" class="calibre1">It was a strange sensation. These guys Par had never met before
chatted with him about the latest Michael Jackson video as if he was a
neighbour or friend just returned from out of town. Then they took him
further uptown, to a police station, for more extradition paperwork.</p>

<p id="id01039" class="calibre1">This place was no World Trade Center deluxe office. Par stared at the
peeling grey paint in the ancient room, and then watched officers
typing out reports using the two-finger hunt-and-peck method on
electric typewritersâ€”not a computer in sight. The officers didn't
cuff Par to the desk. Par was in the heart of a police station and
there was no way he was going anywhere.</p>

<p id="id01040" class="calibre1">While the officer handling Par was away from his desk for ten minutes,
Par felt bored. So he began flipping through the folders with
information on other cases on the officer's desk. They were heavy duty
fraud casesâ€”mafia and drug-money launderingâ€”cases which carried
reference to FBI involvement. These people looked hairy.</p>

<p id="id01041" class="calibre1">That day, Par had a quick appearance in court, just long enough to be
given protective custody in the Manhattan detention complex known as
the Tombs while he waited for the authorities from California to come
and pick him up.</p>

<p id="id01042" class="calibre1">Par spent almost a week in the Tombs. By day three, he was climbing
the walls. It was like being buried alive.</p>

<p id="id01043" class="calibre1">During that week, Par had almost no contact with other human beingsâ€”a
terrible punishment for someone with so much need for a continual flow
of new information. He never left his cell. His jailer slid trays of
food into his cell and took them away.</p>

<p id="id01044" class="calibre1">On day six, Par went nuts. He threw a fit, began screaming and banging
on the door. He yelled at the guard. Told him none too nicely that he
wanted to `get the fuck outta here'. The guard said he would see if he
could get Par transferred to Rikers Island, New York's notorious jail.
Par didn't care if he was transferred to the moon, as long as he got
out of solitary confinement.</p>

<p id="id01045" class="calibre1">Except for the serial killer, the north infirmary at Rikers Island was
a considerable improvement on the Tombs. Par was only locked in his
cell at night. During the day he was free to roam inside the infirmary
area with other prisoners. Some of them were there because the
authorities didn't want to put them in with the hardened criminals,
and some of them were there because they were probably criminally
insane.</p>

<p id="id01046" class="calibre1">It was an eclectic bunch. A fireman turned jewellery heister. A
Colombian drug lord. A chop-shop ringleader, who collected more than
300 stolen cars, chopped them up, reassembled them as new and then
sold them off. A man who killed a homosexual for coming onto him.
`Faggot Killer', as he was known inside, hadn't meant to kill anyone:
things had gotten a little out of hand; next thing he knew, he was
facing ten to twelve on a murder rap.</p>

<p id="id01047" class="calibre1">Par wasn't wild about the idea of hanging out with a murderer, but he
was nervous about what could happened to a young man in jail. Forging
a friendship with Faggot Killer would send the right message. Besides,
the guy seemed to be OK. Well, as long as you didn't look at him the
wrong way.</p>

<p id="id01048" class="calibre1">On his first day, Par also met Kentucky, a wild-eyed man who
introduced himself by thrusting a crumpled newspaper article into the
hacker's hand and saying, `That's me'. The article, titled `Voices
Told Him to Kill', described how police had apprehended a serial
killer believed to be responsible for a dozen murders, maybe more.
During his last murder, Kentucky told Par he had killed a womanâ€”and
then written the names of the aliens who had commanded him to do it on
the walls of her apartment in her blood.</p>

<p id="id01049" class="calibre1">The jewellery heister tried to warn Par to stay away from Kentucky,
who continued to liaise with the aliens on a regular basis. But it was
too late. Kentucky decided that he didn't like the young hacker. He
started shouting at Par, picking a fight. Par stood there, stunned and
confused. How should he deal with an aggravated serial killer? And
what the hell was he doing in jail with a serial killer raving at him
anyway? It was all too much.</p>

<p id="id01050" class="calibre1">The jewellery heister rushed over to Kentucky and tried to calm him
down, speaking in soothing tones. Kentucky glowered at Par, but he
stopped yelling.</p>

<p id="id01051" class="calibre1">A few days into his stay at Rikers, Faggot Killer invited Par to join
in a game of Dungeons and Dragons. It beat watching TV talk shows all
day, so Par agreed. He sat down at the metal picnic table where Faggot
Killer had laid out the board.</p>

<p id="id01052" class="calibre1">So it was that Par, the twenty-year-old computer hacker from
California, the X.25 network whiz kid, came to play Dungeons and
Dragons with a jewellery thief, a homophobic murderer and a mad serial
killer in Rikers Island. Par found himself marvelling at the
surrealism of the situation.</p>

<p id="id01053" class="calibre1">Kentucky threw himself into the game. He seemed to get off on killing
hobgoblins.</p>

<p id="id01054" class="calibre1">`I'll take my halberd,' Kentucky began with a smile, `and I stab this
goblin.' The next player began to make his move, but Kentucky
interrupted. `I'm not done,' he said slowly, as a demonic grin spread
across his face. `And I slice it. And cut it. It bleeds everywhere.'
Kentucky's face tensed with pleasure.</p>

<p id="id01055" class="calibre1">The other three players shifted uncomfortably in their seats. Par
looked at Faggot Killer with nervous eyes.</p>

<p id="id01056" class="calibre1">`And I thrust a knife into its heart,' Kentucky continued, the volume
of his voice rising with excitement. `Blood, blood, everywhere blood.
And I take the knife and hack him. And I hack and hack and hack.'</p>

<p id="id01057" class="calibre1">Kentucky jumped up from the table and began shouting, thrusting one
arm downward through the air with an imaginary dagger, `And I hack and
I hack and I hack!'</p>

<p id="id01058" class="calibre1">Then Kentucky went suddenly still. Everyone at the table froze. No-one
dared move for fear of driving him over the edge. Par's stomach had
jumped into his throat. He tried to gauge how many seconds it would
take to extricate himself from the picnic table and make a break for
the far side of the room.</p>

<p id="id01059" class="calibre1">In a daze, Kentucky walked away from the table, leaned his forehead
against the wall and began mumbling quietly. The jewellery heister
slowly followed and spoke to him briefly in hushed tones before
returning to the table.</p>

<p id="id01060" class="calibre1">One of the guards had heard the ruckus and came up to the table.</p>

<p id="id01061" class="calibre1">`Is that guy OK?' he asked the jewellery heister while pointing to<br class="calibre4"/>

Kentucky.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01062" class="calibre1">Not even if you used that term loosely, Par thought.</p>

<p id="id01063" class="calibre1">`Leave him alone,' the heister told the guard. `He's talking to the
aliens.'</p>

<p id="id01064" class="calibre1">`Right.' The guard turned around and left.</p>

<p id="id01065" class="calibre1">Every day, a nurse brought around special medicine for Kentucky. In
fact, Kentucky was zonked out most of the time on a cup of horrible,
smelly liquid. Sometimes, though, Kentucky secreted his medicine away
and traded it with another prisoner who wanted to get zonked out for a
day or so.</p>

<p id="id01066" class="calibre1">Those were bad days, the days when Kentucky had sold his medication.<br class="calibre4"/>

It was on one of those days that he tried to kill Par.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01067" class="calibre1">Par sat on a metal bench, talking to other prisoners, when suddenly he
felt an arm wrap around his neck. He tried to turn around, but
couldn't.</p>

<p id="id01068" class="calibre1">`Here. I'll show you how I killed this one guy,' Kentucky whispered to<br class="calibre4"/>

Par.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01069" class="calibre1">`Noâ€”Noâ€”' Par started to say, but Kentucky's biceps began pressing
against Par's Adam's apple. It was a vice-like grip.</p>

<p id="id01070" class="calibre1">`Yeah. Like this. I did it like this,' Kentucky said as he tensed his
muscle and pulled backward.</p>

<p id="id01071" class="calibre1">`No! Really, you don't need to. It's OK,' Par gasped. No air. His arms
flailing in front of him.</p>

<p id="id01072" class="calibre1">I'm done for, Par thought. My life is over. Hacker Murdered by Serial<br class="calibre4"/>

Killer in Rikers Island. `Aliens Told Me to Do It.'<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01073" class="calibre1">The omnipresent jewellery heister came up to Kentucky and started
cooing in his ear to let Par go. Then, just when Par thought he was
about to pass out, the jewellery heister pulled Kentucky off him.</p>

<p id="id01074" class="calibre1">Par reminded himself to always sit with his back against the wall.</p>

<p id="id01075" class="calibre1">Finally, after almost a month behind bars, Par was informed that an
officer from the Monterey County sheriff's office was coming to take
him back to California. Par had agreed to be extradited to California
after seeing the inside of New York's jails. Dealing with the federal
prosecutor in New York had also helped make up his mind.</p>

<p id="id01076" class="calibre1">The US Attorney's Office in New York gave Richard Rosen, who had taken
the case on again, a real headache. They didn't play ball. They played
`Queen for a Day'.</p>

<p id="id01077" class="calibre1">The way they negotiated reminded Rosen of an old American television
game of that name. The show's host pulled some innocent soul off the
street, seated her on a garish throne, asked her questions and then
gave her prizes. The US Attorney's Office in New York wanted to seat
Par on a throne, of sorts, to ask him lots of questions. At the end of
the unfettered interrogation, they would hand out prizes. Prison
terms. Fines. Convictions. As they saw fit. No guaranteed sentences.
They would decide what leniency, if any, he would get at the end of
the game.</p>

<p id="id01078" class="calibre1">Par knew what they were looking for: evidence against the MOD boys. He
wasn't having a bar of that. The situation stank, so Par decided not to
fight the extradition to California. Anything had to be better than New
York, with its crazy jail inmates and arrogant federal prosecutors.</p>

<p id="id01079" class="calibre1">The officer from the Monterey sheriff's office picked Par up on 17<br class="calibre4"/>

December 1991.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01080" class="calibre1">Par spent the next few weeks in jail in California, but this time he
wasn't in any sort of protective custody. He had to share a cell with
Mexican drug dealers and other mafia, but at least he knew his way
around these people. And unlike the some of the people at Rikers, they
weren't stark raving lunatics.</p>

<p id="id01081" class="calibre1">Richard Rosen took the case back, despite Par's having skipped town
the first time, which Par thought was pretty good of the lawyer. But
Par had no idea how good it would be for him until it came to his
court date.</p>

<p id="id01082" class="calibre1">Par called Rosen from the jail, to talk about the case. Rosen had some
big news for him.</p>

<p id="id01083" class="calibre1">`Plead guilty. You're going to plead guilty to everything,' he told<br class="calibre4"/>

Par.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01084" class="calibre1">Par thought Rosen had lost his marbles.</p>

<p id="id01085" class="calibre1">`No. We can win this case if you plead guilty,' Rosen assured him.</p>

<p id="id01086" class="calibre1">Par sat dumbfounded at the other end of the phone.</p>

<p id="id01087" class="calibre1">`Trust me,' the lawyer said.</p>

<p id="id01088" class="calibre1">The meticulous Richard Rosen had found a devastating weapon.</p>

<p id="id01089" class="calibre1">On 23 December 1991, Par pleaded guilty to two charges in Monterey
County Juvenile Court. He admitted everything. The whole nine yards.
Yes, I am The Parmaster. Yes, I broke into computers. Yes, I took
thousands of credit card details from a Citibank machine. Yes, yes,
yes.</p>

<p id="id01090" class="calibre1">In some way, the experience was cathartic, but only because Par knew<br class="calibre4"/>

Rosen had a brilliant ace up his sleeve.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01091" class="calibre1">Rosen had rushed the case to be sure it would be heard in juvenile
court, where Par would get a more lenient sentence. But just because
Rosen was in a hurry didn't mean he was sloppy. When he went through
Par's file with a fine-toothed comb he discovered the official papers
declared Par's birthday to be 15 January 1971. In fact, Par's birthday
was some days earlier, but the DA's office didn't know that.</p>

<p id="id01092" class="calibre1">Under California law, a juvenile court has jurisdiction over citizens
under the age of 21. You can only be tried and sentenced in a juvenile
court if you committed the crimes in question while under the age of
eighteen and you are still under the age of 21 when you plead and are
sentenced.</p>

<p id="id01093" class="calibre1">Par was due to be sentenced on 13 January but on 8 January Rosen
applied for the case to be thrown out. When Deputy DA David Schott
asked why, Rosen dropped his bomb.</p>

<p id="id01094" class="calibre1">Par had already turned 21 and the juvenile court had no authority to
pass sentence over him. Further, in California, a case cannot be moved
into an adult court if the defendant has already entered a plea in a
juvenile one. Because Par had already done that, his case couldn't be
moved. The matter was considered `dealt with' in the eyes of the law.</p>

<p id="id01095" class="calibre1">The Deputy DA was flabbergasted. He spluttered and spewed. The DA's
office had dropped the original charges from a felony to a
misdemeanour. They had come to the table. How could this happen? Par
was a fugitive. He had been on the run for more than two years from
the frigging Secret Service, for Christ's sake. There was no wayâ€”NO
WAYâ€”he was going to walk out of that courtroom scot-free.</p>

<p id="id01096" class="calibre1">The court asked Par to prove his birthday. A quick driver's licence
search at the department of motor vehicles showed Par and his lawyer
were telling the truth. So Par walked free.</p>

<p id="id01097" class="calibre1">When he stepped outside the courthouse, Par turned his face toward the
sun. After almost two months in three different jails on two sides of
the continent, the sun felt magnificent. Walking around felt
wonderful. Just wandering down the street made him happy.</p>

<p id="id01098" class="calibre1">However, Par never really got over being on the run.</p>

<p id="id01099" class="calibre1">From the time he walked free from the County Jail in Salinas,
California, he continued to move around the country, picking up
temporary work here and there. But he found it hard to settle in one
place. Worst of all, strange things began happening to him. Well, they
had always happened to him, but they were getting stranger by the
month. His perception of reality was changing.</p>

<p id="id01100" class="calibre1">There was the incident in the motel room. As Par sat in the Las Vegas
Travelodge on one if his cross-country treks, he perceived someone
moving around in the room below his. Par strained to hear. It seemed
like the man was talking to him. What was the man trying to tell him?
Par couldn't quite catch the words, but the more he listened, the more
Par was sure he had a message for him which he didn't want anyone else
to hear. It was very frustrating. No matter how hard he tried, no
matter how he put his ear down to the floor or against the wall, Par
couldn't make it out.</p>

<p id="id01101" class="calibre1">The surreal experiences continued. As Par described it, on a trip down
to Mexico, he began feeling quite strange, so he went to the US
consulate late one afternoon to get some help. But everyone in the
consulate behaved bizarrely.</p>

<p id="id01102" class="calibre1">They asked him for some identification, and he gave them his wallet.
They took his Social Security card and his California identification
card and told him to wait. Par believed they were going to pull up
information about him on a computer out the back. While waiting, his
legs began to tremble and a continuous shiver rolled up and down his
spine. It wasn't a smooth, fluid shiver, it was jerky. He felt like he
was sitting at the epicentre of an earthquake and it frightened him.
The consulate staff just stared
at him.</p>

<p id="id01103" class="calibre1">Finally Par stopped shaking. The other staff member returned and asked
him to leave.</p>

<p id="id01104" class="calibre1">`No-one can help you here,' he told Par.</p>

<p id="id01105" class="calibre1">Why was the consular official talking to him like that? What did he
meanâ€”Par had to leave? What was he really trying to say? Par couldn't
understand him. Another consular officer came around to Par, carrying
handcuffs. Why was everyone behaving in such a weird way? That
computer. Maybe they had found some special message next to his name
on that computer.</p>

<p id="id01106" class="calibre1">Par tried to explain the situation, but the consulate staff didn't
seem to understand. He told them about how he had been on the run from
the Secret Service for two and a half years, but that just got him
queer looks. Blank faces. No comprehende. The more he explained, the
blanker the faces became.</p>

<p id="id01107" class="calibre1">The consular officials told him that the office was closing for the
day. He would have to leave the building. But Par suspected that was
just an excuse. A few minutes later, a Mexican policeman showed up. He
talked with one of the consular officials, who subsequently handed him
what Par perceived to be a slip of paper wrapped around a wad of peso
notes.</p>

<p id="id01108" class="calibre1">Two more policemen came into the consulate. One of them turned to Par
and said, `Leave!' but Par didn't answer. So the Mexican police
grabbed Par by the arms and legs and carried him out of the consulate.
Par felt agitated and confused and, as they crossed the threshold out
of the consulate, he screamed.</p>

<p id="id01109" class="calibre1">They put him in a police car and took him to a jail, where they kept
him overnight.</p>

<p id="id01110" class="calibre1">The next day, they released Par and he wandered the city aimlessly
before ending up back at the US consulate. The same consular officer
came up to him and asked how he was feeling.</p>

<p id="id01111" class="calibre1">Par said, `OK.'</p>

<p id="id01112" class="calibre1">Then Par asked if the official could help him get back to the border,
and he said he could. A few minutes later a white van picked up Par
and took him to the border crossing. When they arrived, Par asked the
driver if he could have $2 so he could buy a ticket for the train. The
driver gave it to him.</p>

<p id="id01113" class="calibre1">Par boarded the train with no idea of where he was headed.</p>

<p id="id01114" class="calibre2">Theorem visited Par in California twice in 1992 and the relationship
continued to blossom. Par tried to find work so he could pay her back
the $20000 she had lent him during his years on the run and during his
court case, but it was hard going. People didn't seem to want to hire
him.</p>

<p id="id01115" class="calibre1">`You don't have any computer skills,' they told him. He calmly
explained that, yes, he did indeed have computer skills.</p>

<p id="id01116" class="calibre1">`Well, which university did you get your degree from?' they asked.</p>

<p id="id01117" class="calibre1">No, he hadn't got his skills at any university.</p>

<p id="id01118" class="calibre1">`Well, which companies did you get your work experience from?'</p>

<p id="id01119" class="calibre1">No, he hadn't learned his skills while working for a company.</p>

<p id="id01120" class="calibre1">`Well, what did you do from 1989 to 1992?' the temp agency staffer
inevitably asked in an exasperated voice.</p>

<p id="id01121" class="calibre1">`I â€¦ ah â€¦ travelled around the country.' What else was Par going
to say? How could he possibly answer that question?</p>

<p id="id01122" class="calibre1">If he was lucky, the agency might land him a data-entry job at $8 per
hour. If he was less fortunate, he might end up doing clerical work
for less than that.</p>

<p id="id01123" class="calibre1">By 1993, things had become a little rocky with Theorem. After four and
a half years together, they broke up. The distance was too great, in
every sense. Theorem wanted a more stable lifeâ€”maybe not a
traditional Swiss family with three children and a pretty chalet in
the Alps, but something more than Par's transient life on the road.</p>

<p id="id01124" class="calibre1">The separation was excruciatingly painful for both of them.
Conversation was strained for weeks after the decision. Theorem kept
thinking she had made a mistake. She kept wanting to ask Par to come
back. But she didn't.</p>

<p id="id01125" class="calibre1">Par drowned himself in alcohol. Shots of tequila, one after the other.<br class="calibre4"/>

Scull it. Slam the glass down. Fill it to the top. Throw back another.<br class="calibre4"/>

After a while, he passed out. Then he was violently ill for days, but<br class="calibre4"/>

somehow he didn't mind. It was cleansing to be so ill.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01126" class="calibre1">Somewhere along the way, Rosen managed to get Par's things returned
from the Secret Service raids. He passed the outdated computer and
other equipment back to Par, along with disks, print-outs and notes.</p>

<p id="id01127" class="calibre1">Par gathered up every shred of evidence from his case, along with a
bottle of Jack Daniels, and made a bonfire. He shredded print-outs,
doused them in lighter fluid and set them alight. He fed the disks
into the fire and watched them melt in the flames. He flipped through
the pages and pages of notes and official reports and let them pull
out particular memories. Then he crumpled up each one and tossed it in
the fire. He even sprinkled a little Jack Daniels across the top for
good measure.</p>

<p id="id01128" class="calibre1">As he pulled the pages from a Secret Service report, making them into
tight paper balls, something caught his eye and made him wonder. Many
hackers around the world had been busted in a series of raids
following the first Thanksgiving raid at Par's house back in 1988.
Erik Bloodaxe, the MOD boys, the LOD boys, The Atlanta Three, Pad and
Gandalf, the Australiansâ€”they had all been either busted or raided
during 1989, 1990 and 1991.</p>

<p id="id01129" class="calibre1">How were the raids connected? Were the law-enforcement agencies on
three different continents really organised enough to coordinate
worldwide attacks on hackers?</p>

<p id="id01130" class="calibre1">The Secret Service report gave him a clue. It said that in December
1988, two informants had called Secret Service special agents in
separate divisions with information about Par. The informantsâ€”both
hackersâ€”told the Secret Service that Par was not the `Citibank
hacker' the agency was looking for. They said the real `Citibank
hacker' was named Phoenix.</p>

<p id="id01131" class="calibre1">Phoenix from Australia.</p>

<h5 id="id01132" class="calibre9">                        Chapter 5 â€” The Holy Grail.</h5>

<p id="id01134" class="calibre1">â€” from `River Runs Red', Blue Sky Mining.</p>

<p id="id01135" class="calibre1">There it was, in black and white. Two articles by Helen Meredith in
The Australian in January 1989.2 The whole Australian computer
underground was buzzing with the news.</p>

<p id="id01136" class="calibre1">The first article appeared on 14 January:</p>

<p id="id01137" class="calibre1">Citibank hackers score $500,000</p>

<p id="id01138" class="calibre1">An elite group of Australian hackers has lifted more than
$US500,000 ($580,000) out of America's Citibank in one of the more
daring hacking crimes in Australia's history.</p>

<p id="id01139" class="calibre1">Australian federal authorities were reported late yesterday to be
working with American authorities to pin down the Australian
connection involving hackers in Melbourne and Sydney.</p>

<p id="id01140" class="calibre1">These are the elite `freekers' of white collar crime â€¦</p>

<p id="id01141" class="calibre1">The Australian connection is reported to have used a telephone in
the foyer of Telecom's headquarters at 199 William Street in
Melbourne to send a 2600-hertz signal giving them access to a trunk
line and ultimately to a managerial access code for Citibank.</p>

<p id="id01142" class="calibre1">Sources said last night the hackers had lifted $US563,000 from the
US bank and transferred it into several accounts. The money has now
been withdrawn â€¦</p>

<p id="id01143" class="calibre1">Meanwhile, Victorian police were reported yesterday to be
systematically searching the homes of dozens of suspects in a
crackdown on computer hackers â€¦</p>

<p id="id01144" class="calibre1">An informed source said Criminal Investigation Bureau officers
armed with search warrants were now searching through the
belongings of the hacking community and expected to find hundreds
of thousands of dollars of goods.</p>

<p id="id01145" class="calibre1">An informed source said Criminal Investigation Bureau officers
armed with search warrants were now searching through the

<p id="id01146" class="calibre1">The second article was published ten days later:</p>

<p id="id01147" class="calibre1">Hackers list card hauls on boards</p>

<p id="id01148" class="calibre1">Authorities remain sceptical of the latest reports of an
international hacking and phreaking ring and its Australian
connection.</p>

<p id="id01149" class="calibre1">Yesterday, however, evidence continued to stream into the Melbourne
based bulletin boards under suspicion â€¦</p>

<p id="id01150" class="calibre1">In the latest round of bulletin board activity, a message from a
United States hacker known as Captain Cash provided the Australian
connection with the latest news on Australian credit cards,
provided by local hackers, and their illegal use by US hackers to
the value of $US362 018 ($416112).</p>

<p id="id01151" class="calibre1">The information was taken from a computer bulletin board system
known as Pacific Island and used actively by the Australian
connection.</p>

<p id="id01152" class="calibre1">The message read: `OK on the 5353 series which we are closing
todayâ€”Mastercard $109 400.50. On the 4564 seriesâ€”Visa which I'll
leave open for a week</p>

<p id="id01153" class="calibre1">$209417.90. And on good old don't leave home without someone
else's: $43 200.</p>

<p id="id01154" class="calibre1">`Making a grand total of</p>

<p id="id01155" class="calibre1">$362018.40!</p>

<p id="id01156" class="calibre1">`Let's hear it for our Aussie friends!</p>

<p id="id01157" class="calibre1">`I hear they are doing just as well!</p>

<p id="id01158" class="calibre1">`They are sending more numbers on the 23rd! Great!</p>

<p id="id01159" class="calibre1">`They will be getting 10%</p>

<p id="id01160" class="calibre1">as usualâ€¦a nice bonus of</p>

<p id="id01161" class="calibre1">$36 200.00!'</p>

<p id="id01162" class="calibre1">The bulletin board also contained advice for phreakers on using
telephones in Telecom's 199 William Street headquarters and the
green phones at Spencer Street Station in Melbourneâ€”to make free
international calls â€¦</p>

<p id="id01163" class="calibre1">Phoenix, another local bulletin board user, listed prices for<br class="calibre4"/>

`EXTC'- tablets â€¦<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01164" class="calibre1">Late Friday, The Australian received evidence suggesting a break-in
of the US Citibank network by Australian hackers known as The Realm
â€¦</p>

<p id="id01165" class="calibre1">The gang's US connection is believed to be based in Milwaukee and
Houston. US Federal authorities have already raided US hackers
involved in Citibank break-ins in the US.</p>

<p id="id01166" class="calibre1">A covert operation of the Bureau of Criminal Intelligence has had
the Australian connection under surveillance and last week took
delivery of six months' of evidence from the Pacific Island board
and associated boards going by the name of Zen and Megaworks â€¦</p>

<p id="id01167" class="calibre1">The Australian hackers include a number of Melbourne people, some
teenagers, suspected or already convicted of crimes including
fraud, drug use and car theft. Most are considered to be at the
least, digital voyeurs, at worst criminals with a possible big
crime connection.</p>

<p id="id01168" class="calibre1">The information received by The Australian amounts to a confession
on the part of the Australian hackers to involvement in the
break-in of the US Citibank network as well as advice on phreaking
â€¦ and bank access.</p>

<p id="id01169" class="calibre1">The following is taken directly from the bulletin board â€¦ It was
stored in a private mailbox on the board and is from a hacker known
as Ivan Trotsky to one who uses the name Killer Tomato:</p>

<p id="id01170" class="calibre1">`OK this is what's been happening â€¦</p>

<p id="id01171" class="calibre1">`While back a Sysop had a call from the Feds, they wanted Force's,
Phoenix's, Nom's, Brett Macmillan's and my names in connection with
some hacking The Realm had done and also with some carding meant to
have been done too.</p>

<p id="id01172" class="calibre1">`Then in the last few days I get info passed to me that the Hack
that was done to the Citibank in the US which has led to arrests
over there also had connections to Force and Electron â€¦'</p>

<p id="id01173" class="calibre1">DPG monitoring service spokesman, Mr Stuart Gill, said he believed
the Pacific Island material was only the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p id="id01174" class="calibre1">`They're far better organised than the police,' he said.</p>

<p id="id01175" class="calibre1">`Unless everyone gets their act together and we legislate against
it, we'll still be talking about the same things this time next
year.'</p>

<p id="id01176" class="calibre1">Yesterday, the South Australian police started an operation to put
bulletin boards operating in that state under surveillance.</p>

<p id="id01177" class="calibre1">And in Western Australia, both political parties agreed they would
proceed with an inquiry into computer hacking, whoever was in
government.</p>

<p id="id01178" class="calibre1">The Victoria Police fraud squad last week announced it had set up a
computer crime squad that would investigate complaints of computer
fraud.</p>

<p id="id01179" class="calibre1">The articles were painful reading for most in the computer
underground.</p>

<p id="id01180" class="calibre1">Who was this Captain Cash? Who was the Killer Tomato? Many believed
they were either Stuart Gill, or that Gill had forged messages by them
or others on Bowen's board. Was the underground rife with credit card
frauders? No. They formed only a very small part of that community.
Had the Melbourne hackers stolen half a million dollars from Citibank?
Absolutely not. A subsequent police investigation determined this
allegation to be a complete fabrication.</p>

<p id="id01181" class="calibre1">How had six months' worth of messages from PI and Zen found their way
into the hands of the Victoria Police Bureau of Criminal Intelligence?
Members of the underground had their suspicions.</p>

<p id="id01182" class="calibre1">To some, Stuart Gill's role in the underground appeared to be that of
an information trader. He would feed a police agency information, and
garner a little new material from it in exchange. He then amalgamated
the new and old material and delivered the new package to another
police agency, which provided him a little more material to add to the
pot. Gill appeared to play the same game in the underground.</p>

<p id="id01183" class="calibre1">A few members of the underground, particularly PI and Zen regulars
Mentat and Brett MacMillan, suspected chicanery and began fighting a
BBS-based war to prove their point. In early 1989, MacMillan posted a
message stating that Hackwatch was not registered as a business
trading name belonging to Stuart Gill at the Victorian Corporate
Affairs office. Further, he stated, DPG Monitoring Services did not
exist as an official registered business trading name either.
MacMillan then stunned the underground by announcing that he had
registered the name Hackwatch himself, presumably to stop Stuart
Gill's media appearances as a Hackwatch spokesman.</p>

<p id="id01184" class="calibre1">Many in the underground felt duped by Gill, but they weren't the only
ones. Soon some journalists and police would feel the same way. Stuart
Gill wasn't even his real name.</p>

<p id="id01185" class="calibre1">What Gill really wanted, some citizens in the underground came to
believe, was a public platform from which he could whip up hacker hype
and then demand the introduction of tough new anti-hacking laws. In
mid-1989, the Commonwealth Government did just that, enacting the
first federal computer crime laws.</p>
