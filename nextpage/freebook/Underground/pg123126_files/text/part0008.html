    All of which gave him cause to wonder why the media was running this
story now, after Wandii's acquittal but before he and Gandalf were
sentenced. Sour grapes, perhaps?</p>

<p id="id01977" class="calibre1">For days, columnists, editorial and letter writers across Britain
pontificated on the meaning of the Wandii's verdict and the validity
of an addiction to hacking as a defence. Some urged computer owners to
take responsibility for securing their own systems. Others called for
tougher hacking laws. A few echoed the view of The Times, which
declared in an editorial, `a persistent car thief of [the hacker's]
age would almost certainly have received a custodial sentence. Both
crimes suggest disrespect for other people's property … the jurors
may have failed to appreciate the seriousness of this kind of
offence'.10</p>

<p id="id01978" class="calibre1">The debate flew forward, changing and growing, and expanding beyond
Britain's borders. In Hong Kong, the South China Morning Post asked,
`Is [this] case evidence of a new social phenomenon, with immature and
susceptible minds being damaged through prolonged exposure to personal
computers?' The paper described public fear that Wandii's case would
result in `the green light for an army of computer-literate hooligans
to pillage the world's databases at will, pleading insanity when
caught'.11</p>

<p id="id01979" class="calibre1">By April Fool's Day 1991, more than two weeks after the end of the
court case, Wandii had his own syndrome named after him, courtesy of
The Guardian.</p>

<p id="id01980" class="calibre1">And while Wandii, his mother and his team of lawyers celebrated their
victory quietly, the media reported that the Scotland Yard detectives
commiserated over their defeat, which was considerably more serious
than simply losing the Wandii case. The Computer Crimes Unit was being
`reorganised'. Two experienced officers from the five-man unit were
being moved out of the group. The official line was that the
`rotations' were normal Scotland Yard procedure. The unofficial word
was that the Wandii case had been a fiasco, wasting time and money,
and the debacle was not to be repeated.</p>

<p id="id01981" class="calibre1">In the north, a dark cloud gathered over Pad and Gandalf as their
judgment day approached. The Wandii case verdict might have been cause
for celebration among some in the computer underground, but it brought
little joy for the other two 8lgm hackers.</p>

<p id="id01982" class="calibre1">For Pad and Gandalf, who had already pleaded guilty, Wandii's
acquittal was a disaster.</p>

<p id="id01983" class="calibre2">On 12 May 1993, two months after Wandii's acquittal, Boris Kayser
stood up at the Bar table to put forward Electron's case at the
Australian hacker's plea and sentencing hearing. As he began to speak,
a hush fell over the Victorian County Court.</p>

<p id="id01984" class="calibre1">A tall, burly man with a booming voice, an imperious courtroom
demeanour and his traditional black robes flowing behind him in an
echo of his often emphatic gesticulations, Kayser was larger than
life. A master showman, he knew how to play an audience of courtroom
journalists sitting behind him as much as to the judge in front of
him.</p>

<p id="id01985" class="calibre1">Electron had already stood in the dock and pleaded guilty to fourteen
charges, as agreed with the DPP's office. In typical style, Kayser had
interrupted the long process of the court clerk reading out each
charge and asking whether Electron would plead guilty or not guilty.
With an impatient wave of his hand, Kayser asked the judge to dispense
with such formalities since his client would plead guilty to all the
agreed charges at once. The interjection was more of an announcement
than a question.</p>

<p id="id01986" class="calibre1">The formalities of a plea having been summarily dealt with, the
question now at hand was sentencing. Electron wondered if he would be
sent to prison. Despite lobbying from Electron's lawyers, the DPP's
office had refused to recommend a non-custodial sentence. The best
deal Electron's lawyers had been able to arrange in exchange for
turning Crown witness was for the DPP to remain silent on the issue of
prison. The judge would make up his mind without input from the DPP.</p>

<p id="id01987" class="calibre1">Electron fiddled nervously with his father's wedding ring, which he
wore on his right hand. After his father's death, Electron's sister
had begun taking things from the family home. Electron didn't care
much because there were only two things he really wanted: that ring
and some of his father's paintings.</p>

<p id="id01988" class="calibre1">Kayser called a handful of witnesses to support the case for a light
sentence. Electron's grandmother from Queensland. The family friend
who had driven Electron to the hospital the day his father died.
Electron's psychiatrist, the eminent Lester Walton. Walton in
particular highlighted the difference between the two possible paths
forward: prison, which would certainly traumatise an already mentally
unstable young man, or freedom, which offered Electron a good chance
of eventually establishing a normal life.</p>

<p id="id01989" class="calibre1">When Kayser began summarising the case for a non-custodial sentence,
Electron could hear the pack of journalists off to his side
frantically scribbling notes. He wanted to look at them, but he was
afraid the judge would see his ponytail, carefully tucked into his
neatly ironed white shirt, if he turned sideways,</p>

<p id="id01990" class="calibre1">`Your Honour,' Kayser glanced backward slightly, toward the court
reporters, as he warmed up, `my client lived in an artificial world of
electronic pulses.'</p>

<p id="id01991" class="calibre1">Scratch, scribble. Electron could almost predict, within half a
second, when the journalists' pencils and pens would reach a crescendo
of activity. The ebb and flow of Boris's boom was timed in the style
of a TV newsreader.</p>

<p id="id01992" class="calibre1">Kayser said his client was addicted to the computer the way an
alcoholic was obsessed with the bottle. More scratching, and lots of
it. This client, Kayser thundered, had never sought to damage any
system, steal money or make a profit. He was not malicious in the
least, he was merely playing a game.</p>

<p id="id01993" class="calibre1">`I think,' Electron's barrister concluded passionately, but slowly
enough for every journalist to get it down on paper, `that he should
have been called Little Jack Horner, who put in his thumb, pulled out
a plumb and said, "What a good boy am I!"'</p>

<p id="id01994" class="calibre1">Now came the wait. The judge retired to his chambers to weigh up the
pre-sentence report, Electron's family situation, the fact that he had
turned Crown witness, his offences—everything. Electron had given a
nine-page written statement against Phoenix to the prosecution. If the
Phoenix case went to trial, Electron would be put on the stand to back
up that statement.</p>

<p id="id01995" class="calibre1">In the month before Electron returned to court to hear his sentence,
he thought about how he could have fought the case. Some of the
charges were dubious.</p>

<p id="id01996" class="calibre1">In one case, he had been charged with illegally accessing public<br class="calibre4"/>

information through a public account. He had accessed the anonymous<br class="calibre4"/>

FTP server at the University of Helsinki to copy information about<br class="calibre4"/>

DES. His first point of access had been through a hacked Melbourne<br class="calibre4"/>

University account.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01997" class="calibre1">Beat that charge, Electron's lawyer had told him, and there's plenty
more where that came from. The DPP had good pickings and could make up
a new charge for another site. Still, Electron reasoned some of the
Crown's evidence would not have stood up under cross-examination.</p>

<p id="id01998" class="calibre1">When reporters from Australia and overseas called NASA headquarters
for comment on the hacker-induced network shutdown, the agency
responded that it had no idea what they were talking about. There had
been no NASA network shutdown. A spokesman made inquiries and, he
assured the media, NASA was puzzled by the report. Sharon Beskenis's
statement didn't seem so watertight after all. She was not, it turned
out, even a NASA employee but a contractor from Lockheed.</p>

<p id="id01999" class="calibre1">During that month-long wait, Electron had trouble living down Kayser's
nursery-rhyme rendition in the courtroom. When he rang friends, they
would open the conversation saying, `Oh, is that Little Jack Horner?'</p>

<p id="id02000" class="calibre1">They had all seen the nightly news, featuring Kayser and his client.
Kayser had looked grave leaving court, while Electron, wearing John
Lennon-style glasses with dark lenses and with his shoulder-length
curls pulled tightly back in a ponytail, had tried to smile at the
camera crews. But his small, fine features and smattering of freckles
disappeared under the harsh camera lights, so much so that the black,
round spectacles seemed almost to float on a blank, white surface.</p>

<p id="id02001" class="calibre1">The week after Electron pleaded guilty in Australia, Pad and Gandalf
sat side by side in London's Southwark dock one last time.</p>

<p id="id02002" class="calibre1">For a day and a half, beginning on 20 May 1993, the two hackers
listened to their lawyers argue their defence. Yes, our clients hacked
computers, they told the judge, but the offences were nowhere near as
serious as the prosecution wants to paint them. The lawyers were
fighting hard for one thing: to keep Pad and Gandalf out of prison.</p>

<p id="id02003" class="calibre1">Some of the hearing was tough going for the two hackers, but not just
because of any sense of foreboding caused by the judge's imminent
decision. The problem was that Gandalf made Pad laugh, and it didn't
look at all good to laugh in the middle of your sentencing hearing.
Sitting next to Gandalf for hours on end, while lawyers from both
sides butchered the technical aspects of computer hacking which the
8lgm hackers had spent years learning, did it. Pad had only to give
Gandalf a quick sidelong glance and he quickly found himself
swallowing and clearing his throat to keep from bursting into
laughter. Gandalf's irrepressible irreverence was written all over his
face.</p>

<p id="id02004" class="calibre1">The stern-faced Judge Harris could send them to jail, but he still
wouldn't understand. Like the gaggle of lawyers bickering at the front
of the courtroom, the judge was—and would always be—out of the loop.
None of them had any idea what was really going on inside the heads of
the two hackers. None of them could ever understand what hacking was
all about—the thrill of stalking a quarry or of using your wits to
outsmart so-called experts; the pleasure of finally penetrating a
much-desired machine and knowing that system is yours; the deep
anti-establishment streak which served as a well-centred ballast
against the most violent storms washing in from the outside world; and
the camaraderie of the international hacking community on Altos.</p>

<p id="id02005" class="calibre1">The lawyers could talk about it, could put experts on the stand and
psychological reports in the hands of the judge, but none of them
would ever really comprehend because they had never experienced it.
The rest of the courtroom was out of the loop, and Pad and Gandalf
stared out from the dock as if looking through a two-way mirror from a
secret, sealed room.</p>

<p id="id02006" class="calibre1">Pad's big worry had been this third charge—the one which he faced
alone. At his plea hearing, he had admitted to causing damage to a
system owned by what was, in 1990, called the Polytechnic of Central
London. He hadn't damaged the machine by, say, erasing files, but the
other side had claimed that the damages totalled about [sterling]250
000.</p>

<p id="id02007" class="calibre1">The hacker was sure there was zero chance the polytechnic had spent
anything near that amount. He had a reasonable idea of how long it
would take someone to clean up his intrusions. But if the prosecution
could convince a judge to accept that figure, the hacker might be
looking at a long prison term.</p>

<p id="id02008" class="calibre1">Pad had already braced himself for the possibility of prison. His
lawyer warned him before the sentencing date that there was a
reasonable likelihood the two 8lgm hackers would be sent down. After
the Wandii case, the public pressure to `correct' a `wrong' decision
by the Wandii jury was enormous. The police had described Wandii's
acquittal as `a licence to hack'—and The Times, had run the
statement.12 It was likely the judge, who had presided over Wandii's
trial, would want to send a loud and clear message to the hacking
community.</p>

<p id="id02009" class="calibre1">Pad thought that perhaps, if he and Gandalf had pleaded not guilty
alongside Wandii, they would have been acquitted. But there was no way
Pad would have subjected himself to the kind of public humiliation
Wandii went through during the `addicted to computers' evidence. The
media appeared to want to paint the three hackers as pallid, scrawny,
socially inept, geeky geniuses, and to a large degree Wandii's lawyers
had worked off this desire. Pad didn't mind being viewed as highly
intelligent, but he wasn't a geek. He had a casual girlfriend. He went
out dancing with friends or to hear bands in Manchester's thriving
alternative music scene. He worked out his upper body with weights at
home. Shy—yes. A geek—no.</p>

<p id="id02010" class="calibre1">Could Pad have made a case for being addicted to hacking? Yes,
although he never believed that he had been. Completely enthralled,
entirely entranced? Maybe. Suffering from a passing obsession?
Perhaps. But addicted? No, he didn't think so. Besides, who knew for
sure if a defence of addiction could have saved him from the
prosecution's claim anyway?</p>

<p id="id02011" class="calibre1">Exactly where the quarter of a million pound claim came from in the
first place was a mystery to Pad. The police had just said it to him,
as if it was fact, in the police interview. Pad hadn't seen any proof,
but that hadn't stopped him from spending a great deal of time feeling
very stressed about how the judge would view the matter.</p>

<p id="id02012" class="calibre1">The only answer seemed to be some good, independent technical advice.
At the request of both Pad and Gandalf's lawyers, Dr Peter Mills, of
Manchester University, and Dr Russell Lloyd, of London Business
School, had examined a large amount of technical evidence presented in
the prosecution's papers. In an independent report running to more
than 23 pages, the experts stated that the hackers had caused less
havoc than the prosecution alleged. In addition, Pad's solicitor asked
Dr Mills to specifically review, in a separate report, the evidence
supporting the prosecution's large damage claim.</p>

<p id="id02013" class="calibre1">Dr Mills stated that one of the police expert witnesses, a British
Telecom employee, had said that Digital recommended a full rebuild of
the system at the earliest possible opportunity—and at considerable
cost. However, the BT expert had not stated that the cost was
[sterling]250000 nor even mentioned if the cost quote which had been
given had actually been accepted.</p>

<p id="id02014" class="calibre1">In fact, Dr Mills concluded that there was no supporting evidence at
all for the quarter of a million pound claim. Not only that, but any
test of reason based on the evidence provided by the prosecution
showed the claim to be completely ridiculous.</p>

<p id="id02015" class="calibre1">In a separate report, Dr Mills' stated that:</p>

<p id="id02016" class="calibre1">i) The machine concerned was a Vax 6320, this is quite a powerful
`mainframe' system and could support several hundreds of users.</p>

<p id="id02017" class="calibre1">ii) That a full dump of files takes 6 tapes, however since the type of
tape is not specified this gives no real indication of the size of the
filesystem. A tape could vary from 0.2 Gigabytes to 2.5 Gigabytes.</p>

<p id="id02018" class="calibre1">iii) The machine was down for three days.</p>

<p id="id02019" class="calibre1">With this brief information it is difficult to give an accurate cost
for restoring the machine, however an over estimate would be:</p>

<p id="id02020" class="calibre1">i) Time spent in restoring the system, 10 man days at [sterling]300
per day; [sterling]3000.</p>

<p id="id02021" class="calibre1">ii) Lost time by users, 30 man days at [sterling]300 per day;
[sterling]9000.</p>

<p id="id02022" class="calibre1">The total cost in my opinion is unlikely to be higher than
[sterling]12000 and this itself is probably a rather high estimate. I
certainly cannot see how a figure of [sterling]250000 could be
justified.</p>

<p id="id02023" class="calibre1">It looked to Pad that the prosecution's claim was not for damage at
all. It was for properly securing the system—an entirely rebuilt
system. It seemed to him that the police were trying to put the cost
of securing the polytechnic's entire computer network onto the
shoulders of one hacker—and to call it damages. In fact, Pad
discovered, the polytechnic had never actually even spent the
[sterling]250000.</p>

<p id="id02024" class="calibre1">Pad was hopeful, but he was also angry. All along, the police had been
threatening him with this huge damage bill. He had tossed and turned
in his bed at night worrying about it. And, in the end, the figure put
forward for so long as fact was nothing but an outrageous claim based
on not a single shred of solid evidence.</p>

<p id="id02025" class="calibre1">Using Dr Mills's report, Pad's barrister, Mukhtar Hussain, QC,
negotiated privately with the prosecution barrister, who finally
relented and agreed to reduce the damage estimate to [sterling]15000.
It was, in Pad's view, still far too high, but it was much better than
[sterling]250000. He was in no mind to look a gift horse in the mouth.</p>

<p id="id02026" class="calibre1">Judge Harris accepted the revised damage estimate.</p>

<p id="id02027" class="calibre1">The prosecution may have lost ground on the damage bill, but it wasn't
giving up the fight. These two hackers, James Richardson told the
court and journalists during the two-day sentencing hearing, had
hacked into some 10000 computer systems around the world. They were
inside machines or networks in at least fifteen countries. Russia.
India. France. Norway. Germany. The US. Canada. Belgium. Sweden.
Italy. Taiwan. Singapore. Iceland. Australia. Officers on the case
said the list of the hackers' targets `read like an atlas', Richardson
told the court.</p>

<p id="id02028" class="calibre1">Pad listened to the list. It sounded about right. What didn't sound
right were the allegations that he or Gandalf had crashed Sweden's
telephone network by running an X.25 scanner over its packet network.
The crash had forced a Swedish government minister to apologise on
television. The police said the minister did not identify the true
cause of the problem—the British hackers—in his public apology.</p>

<p id="id02029" class="calibre1">Pad had no idea what they were talking about. He hadn't done anything
like that to the Swedish phone system, and as far as he knew, neither
had Gandalf.</p>

<p id="id02030" class="calibre1">Something else didn't sound right. Richardson told the court that in
total, the two hackers had racked up at least [sterling]25000 in phone
bills for unsuspecting legitimate customers, and caused `damage' to
systems which was very conservatively estimated at almost
[sterling]123000.</p>

<p id="id02031" class="calibre1">Where were these guys getting these numbers from? Pad marvelled at
their cheek. He had been through the evidence with a fine-toothed
comb, yet he had not seen one single bill showing what a site had
actually paid to repair `damage' caused by the hackers. The figures
tossed around by the police and the prosecution weren't real bills;
they weren't cast in iron.</p>

<p id="id02032" class="calibre1">Finally, on Friday 21 May, after all the evidence had been presented,
the judge adjourned the court to consider sentencing. When he returned
to the bench fifteen minutes later, Pad knew what was going to happen
from the judge's face. To the hacker, the expression said: I am going
to give you everything that Wandii should have got.</p>

<p id="id02033" class="calibre1">Judge Harris echoed The Times's sentiments when he told the two
defendants, `If your passion had been cars rather than computers, we
would have called your conduct delinquent, and I don't shrink from the
analogy of describing what you were doing as intellectual joyriding.</p>

<p id="id02034" class="calibre1">`Hacking is not harmless. Computers now form a central role in our
lives. Some, providing emergency services, depend on their computers
to deliver those services.'13</p>

<p id="id02035" class="calibre1">Hackers needed to be given a clear signal that computer crime `will
not and cannot be tolerated', the judge said, adding that he had
thought long and hard before handing down sentence. He accepted that
neither hacker had intended to cause damage, but it was imperative to
protect society's computer systems and he would be failing in his
public duty if he didn't sentence the two hackers to a prison term of
six months.</p>

<p id="id02036" class="calibre1">Judge Harris told the hackers that he had chosen a custodial sentence,
`both to penalise you for what you have done and for the losses
caused, and to deter others who might be similarly tempted'.</p>

<p id="id02037" class="calibre1">This was the show trial, not Wandii's case, Pad thought as the court
officers led him and Gandalf out of the dock, down to the prisoner's
lift behind the courtroom and into a jail cell.</p>

<p id="id02038" class="calibre1">Less than two weeks after Pad and Gandalf were sentenced, Electron was
back in the Victorian County Court to discover his own fate.</p>

<p id="id02039" class="calibre1">As he stood in the dock on 3 June 1993 he felt numb, as emotionally
removed from the scene as Meursault in Camus' L'etranger. He believed
he was handling the stress pretty well until he experienced tunnel
vision while watching the judge read his penalty. He perused the room
but saw neither Phoenix nor Nom.</p>

<p id="id02040" class="calibre1">When Judge Anthony Smith summarised the charges, he seemed to have a
special interest in count number 13—the Zardoz charge. A few minutes
into reading the sentence, the judge said, `In my view, a custodial
sentence is appropriate for each of the offences constituted by the
12th, 13th and 14th counts'. They were the `knowingly concerned'
charges, with Phoenix, involving NASA, LLNL and CSIRO. Electron looked
around the courtroom. People turned back to stare at him. Their eyes
said, `You are going to prison'.</p>

<p id="id02041" class="calibre1">`I formed the view that a custodial sentence is appropriate in respect
of each of these offences because of the seriousness of them,' Judge
Smith noted, `and having regard to the need to demonstrate that the
community will not tolerate this type of offence.</p>

<p id="id02042" class="calibre1">`Our society today is … increasingly … dependent upon the use of
computer technology. Conduct of the kind in which you engaged poses a
threat to the usefulness of that technology … It is incumbent upon
the courts … to see to it that the sentences they impose reflect the
gravity of this kind of criminality.</p>

<p id="id02043" class="calibre1">`On each of Counts 12, 13 and 14, you are convicted and you are
sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six months … each … to be
concurrent.'</p>

<p id="id02044" class="calibre1">The judge paused, then continued, `And … I direct, by order, that
you be released forthwith upon your giving security by recognisance
… in the sum of $500 … You will not be required to serve the terms
of imprisonment imposed, provided you are of good behaviour for the
ensuing six months.' He then ordered Electron to complete 300 hours of
community service, and to submit to psychiatric assessment and
treatment.</p>

<p id="id02045" class="calibre1">Electron breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p id="id02046" class="calibre1">When outlining the mitigating circumstances which led to suspension of
the jail sentence, Judge Smith described Electron as being addicted to
using his computer `in much the same way as an alcoholic becomes
addicted to the bottle'. Boris Kayser had used the analogy in the
sentencing hearing, perhaps for the
benefit of the media, but the judge had obviously been swayed by his
view.</p>

<p id="id02047" class="calibre1">When court adjourned, Electron left the dock and shook hands with his
lawyers. After three years, he was almost free of his court problems.
There was only one possible reason he might need to return to court.</p>

<p id="id02048" class="calibre1">If Phoenix fought out his case in a full criminal trial, the DPP would
put Electron on the stand to testify against him. It would be an ugly
scene.</p>

<p id="id02049" class="calibre1">The inmates of HM Prison Kirkham, on the north-west coast of England,
near Preston, had heard all about Pad and Gandalf by the time they
arrived. They greeted the hackers by name. They'd seen the reports on
telly, especially about how Gandalf had hacked NASA—complete with
footage of the space shuttle taking off. Some TV reporter's idea of
subtle irony—`Two hackers were sent down today' as the space shuttle
went up.</p>

<p id="id02050" class="calibre1">Kirkham was far better than Brixton, where the hackers had spent the
first days of their sentence while awaiting transfer. Brixton was what
Pad always envisioned prison would look like, with floors of barred
cells facing onto an open centre and prisoners only allowed out of
their cells for scheduled events such as time in the yard. It was a
place where hard-core criminals lived. Fortunately, Pad and Gandalf
had been placed in the same cell while they waited to be assigned to
their final destination.</p>

<p id="id02051" class="calibre1">After ten days inside Brixton Pad and Gandalf were led from their
cell, handcuffed and put in a coach heading toward the windy west
coast.</p>

<p id="id02052" class="calibre1">During the drive, Pad kept looking down at his hand, locked in shiny
steel to Gandalf's hand, then he looked back up again at his fellow
hacker. Clearing his throat and turning away from Gandalf's difficult
grin—his friend now on the edge of laughing himself—Pad struggled.
He tried to hold down the muscles of his face, to pull them back from
laughter.</p>

<p id="id02053" class="calibre1">A minimum security prison holding up to 632 prisoners, Kirkham looked
vaguely like a World War II RAF base with a large collection of
free-standing buildings around the grounds. There were no real walls,
just a small wire fence which Pad soon learned prisoners routinely
jumped when the place started to get to them.</p>

<p id="id02054" class="calibre1">For a prison, Kirkham was pretty good. There was a duck pond, a
bowling green, a sort of mini-cinema which showed films in the early
evenings, eight pay phones, a football field, a cricket pavilion and,
best of all, lots of fields. Prisoners could have visits on weekday
afternoons between 1.10 and 3.40, or on the weekend.</p>

<p id="id02055" class="calibre1">Luck smiled on the two hackers. They were assigned to the same billet
and, since none of the other prisoners objected, they became
room-mates. Since they were sentenced in May, they would serve their
time during summer. If they were `of good behaviour' and didn't get
into trouble with other prisoners, they would be out in three months.</p>

<p id="id02056" class="calibre1">Like any prison, Kirkham had its share of prisoners who didn't get
along with each other. Mostly, prisoners wanted to know what you were
in for and, more particularly, if you had been convicted of a sex
crime. They didn't like sex crime offenders and Pad heard about a pack
of Kirkham prisoners who dragged one of their own, screaming, to a
tree, where they tried to hang him for being a suspected rapist. In
fact, the prisoner hadn't been convicted of anything like rape. He had
simply refused to pay his poll tax.</p>

<p id="id02057" class="calibre1">Fortunately for Pad and Gandalf, everyone else in Kirkham knew why
they were there. At the end of their first week they returned to their
room one afternoon to find a sign painted above their door. It said,
`NASA HQ'.</p>

<p id="id02058" class="calibre1">The other minimum security prisoners understood hacking—and they had
all sorts of ideas about how you could make money from it. Most of the
prisoners in Kirkham were in for petty theft, credit card fraud, and
other small-time crimes. There was also a phreaker, who arrived the
same day as Pad and Gandalf. He landed eight months in prison—two
more than the 8lgm hackers—and Pad wondered what kind of message that
sent the underground.</p>

<p id="id02059" class="calibre1">Despite their best efforts, the 8lgm twosome didn't fit quite the
prison mould. In the evenings, other prisoners spent their free time
shooting pool or taking drugs. In the bedroom down the hall, Gandalf
lounged on his bed studying a book on VMS internals. Pad read a
computer magazine and listened to some indie music—often his `Babes
in Toyland' tape. In a parody of prison movies, the two hackers marked
off their days inside the prison with cross-hatched lines on their
bedroom wall—four marks, then a diagonal line through them. They
wrote other things on the walls too.</p>

<p id="id02060" class="calibre1">The long, light-filled days of summer flowed one into the other, as
Pad and Gandalf fell into the rhythm of the prison. The morning
check-in at 8.30 to make sure none of the prisoners had gone
walkabout. The dash across the bowling green for a breakfast of beans,
bacon, eggs, toast and sausage. The walk to the greenhouses where the
two hackers had been assigned for work detail.</p>

<p id="id02061" class="calibre1">The work wasn't hard. A little digging in the pots. Weeding around the
baby lettuce heads, watering the green peppers and transplanting
tomato seedlings. When the greenhouses became too warm by late
morning, Pad and Gandalf wandered outside for a bit of air. They often
talked about girls, cracking crude, boyish jokes about women and
occasionally discussing their girlfriends more seriously. As the heat
settled in, they sat down, lounging against the side of the
greenhouse.</p>

<p id="id02062" class="calibre1">After lunch, followed by more time in the greenhouse, Pad and Gandalf
sometimes went off for walks in the fields surrounding the prison.
First the football field, then the paddocks dotted with cows beyond
it.</p>

<p id="id02063" class="calibre1">Pad was a likeable fellow, largely because of his easygoing style and
relaxed sense of humour. But liking him wasn't the same as knowing
him, and the humour often deflected deeper probing into his
personality. But Gandalf knew him, understood him. Everything was so
easy with Gandalf. During the long, sunny walks, the conversation
flowed as easily as the light breeze through the grass.</p>

<p id="id02064" class="calibre1">As they wandered in the fields, Pad often wore his denim jacket. Most
of the clothes on offer from the prison clothing office were drab
blue, but Pad had lucked onto this wonderful, cool denim jacket which
he took to wearing all the time.</p>

<p id="id02065" class="calibre1">Walking for hours on end along the perimeters of the prison grounds,
Pad saw how easy it would be to escape, but in the end there didn't
seem to be much point. They way he saw it, the police would just catch
you and put you back in again. Then you'd have to serve extra time.</p>

<p id="id02066" class="calibre1">Once a week, Pad's parents came to visit him, but the few precious
hours of visiting time were more for his parents' benefit than his
own. He reassured them that he was OK, and when they looked him in the
face and saw it was true, they stopped worrying quite so much. They
brought him news from home, including the fact that his computer
equipment had been returned by one of the police who had been in the
original raid.</p>

<p id="id02067" class="calibre1">The officer asked Pad's mother how the hacker was doing in prison.
`Very well indeed,' she told him. `Prison's not nearly so bad as he
thought.' The officer's face crumpled into a disappointed frown. He
seemed to be looking for news that Pad was suffering nothing but
misery.</p>

<p id="id02068" class="calibre1">At the end of almost three months, with faces well tanned from walking
in the meadows, Pad and Gandalf walked free.</p>

<p id="id02069" class="calibre2">To the casual witness sitting nearby in the courtroom, the tension
between Phoenix's mother and father was almost palpable. They were not
sitting near each other but that didn't mitigate the silent hostility
which rose through the air like steam. Phoenix's divorced parents
provided a stark contrast to Nom's adopted parents, an older, suburban
couple who were very much married.</p>

<p id="id02070" class="calibre1">On Wednesday, 25 August 1993 Phoenix and Nom pleaded guilty to fifteen
and two charges respectively. The combined weight of the prosecution's
evidence, the risk and cost of running a full trial and the need to
get on with their lives had pushed them over the edge. Electron didn't
need to come to court to give evidence.</p>

<p id="id02071" class="calibre1">At the plea hearing, which ran over to the next day, Phoenix's lawyer,
Dyson Hore-Lacy, spent considerable time sketching the messy divorce
of his client's parents for the benefit of the judge. Suggesting
Phoenix retreated into his computer during the bitter separation and
divorce was the best chance of getting him off a prison term. Most of
all, the defence presented Phoenix as a young man who had strayed off
the correct path in life but was now back on track—holding down a job
and having a life.</p>

<p id="id02072" class="calibre1">The DPP had gone in hard against Phoenix. They seemed to want a jail
term badly and they doggedly presented Phoenix as an arrogant
braggart. The court heard a tape-recording of Phoenix ringing up
security guru Edward DeHart of the Computer Emergency Response Team at
Carnegie Mellon University to brag about a security exploit. Phoenix
told DeHart to get onto his computer and then proceeded to walk him
step by step through the `passwd -f' security bug. Ironically, it was
Electron who had discovered that security hole and taught it to
Phoenix—a fact Phoenix didn't seem to want to mention to DeHart.</p>

<p id="id02073" class="calibre1">The head of the AFP's Southern Region Computer Crimes Unit, Detective
Sergeant Ken Day was in court that day. There was no way he was going
to miss this. The same witness noting the tension between Phoenix's
parents might also have perceived an undercurrent of hostility between
Day and Phoenix—an undercurrent which did not seem to exist between
Day and either of the other Realm hackers.</p>

<p id="id02074" class="calibre1">Day, a short, careful man who gave off an air of bottled intensity,
seemed to have an acute dislike for Phoenix. By all observations the
feeling was mutual. A cool-headed professional, Day would never say
anything in public to express the dislike—that was not his style. His
dislike was only indicated by a slight tightness in the muscles of an
otherwise unreadable face.</p>

<p id="id02075" class="calibre1">On 6 October 1993, Phoenix and Nom stood side by side in the dock for
sentencing. Wearing a stern expression, Judge Smith began by detailing
both the hackers' charges and the origin of The Realm. But after the
summary, the judge saved his harshest rebuke for Phoenix.</p>

<p id="id02076" class="calibre1">`There is nothing … to admire about your conduct and every reason
why it should be roundly condemned. You pointed out [weaknesses] to
some of the system administrators … [but] this was more a display of
arrogance and a demonstration of what you thought was your superiority
rather than an act of altruism on your part.</p>

<p id="id02077" class="calibre1">`You … bragged about what you had done or were going to do … Your
conduct revealed … arrogance on your part, open defiance, and an
intention to the beat the system. [You] did cause havoc for a time
within the various targeted systems.'</p>

<p id="id02078" class="calibre1">Although the judge appeared firm in his views while passing sentence,
behind the scenes he had agonised greatly over his decision. He had
attempted to balance what he saw as the need for deterrence, the
creation of a precedence for sentencing hacking cases in Australia,
and the individual aspects of this case. Finally, after sifting
through the arguments again and again, he had reached a decision.</p>

<p id="id02079" class="calibre1">`I have no doubt that some sections of our community would regard
anything than a custodial sentence as less than appropriate. I share
that view. But after much reflection … I have concluded that an
immediate term of imprisonment is unnecessary.'</p>

<p id="id02080" class="calibre1">Relief rolled across the faces of the hackers' friends and relatives
as the judge ordered Phoenix to complete 500 hours of community
service work over two years and assigned him a $1000 twelve-month good
behaviour bond. He gave Nom 200 hours, and a $500, six-month bond for
good behaviour.</p>

<p id="id02081" class="calibre1">As Phoenix was leaving the courtroom, a tall, skinny young man, loped
down the aisle towards him.</p>

<p id="id02082" class="calibre1">`Congratulations,' the stranger said, his long hair dangling in
delicate curls around his shoulders.</p>

<p id="id02083" class="calibre1">`Thanks,' Phoenix answered, combing his memory for the boyish face
which couldn't be any older than his own. `Do I know you?'</p>

<p id="id02084" class="calibre1">`Sort of,' the stranger answered. `I'm Mendax. I'm about to go through
what you did, but worse.'</p>

<h5 id="id02085" class="calibre9">                Chapter 8 — The International Subversives.</h5>

<p id="id02086" class="calibre2">All around; an eerie sound.</p>

<p id="id02087" class="calibre1">— from `Maralinga', 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.</p>

<p id="id02088" class="calibre1">Prime Suspect rang Mendax, offering an adventure. He had discovered a
strange system called NMELH1 (pronounced N-Melly-H-1) and it was time
to go exploring. He read off the dial-up numbers, found in a list of
modem phone numbers on another hacked system.</p>

<p id="id02089" class="calibre1">Mendax looked at the scrap of paper in his hand, thinking about the
name of the computer system.</p>

<p id="id02090" class="calibre1">The `N' stood for Northern Telecom, a Canadian company with annual
sales of $8 billion. NorTel, as the company was known, sold thousands
of highly sophisticated switches and other telephone exchange
equipment to some of the world's largest phone companies. The `Melly'
undoubtedly referred to the fact that the system was in Melbourne. As
for the `H-1', well, that was anyone's guess, but Mendax figured it
probably stood for `host-1'—meaning computer site number one.</p>

<p id="id02091" class="calibre1">Prime Suspect had stirred Mendax's interest. Mendax had spent hours
experimenting with commands inside the computers which controlled
telephone exchanges. In the end, those forays were all just
guesswork—trial and error learning, at considerable risk of
discovery. Unlike making a mistake inside a single computer,
mis-guessing a command inside a telephone exchange in downtown Sydney
or Melbourne could take down a whole prefix—10000 or more phone
lines—and cause instant havoc.</p>

<p id="id02092" class="calibre1">This was exactly what the International Subversives didn't want to do.
The three IS hackers—Mendax, Prime Suspect and Trax—had seen what
happened to the visible members of the computer underground in England
and in Australia. The IS hackers had three very good reasons to keep
their activities quiet.</p>

<p id="id02093" class="calibre1">Phoenix. Nom. And Electron.</p>

<p id="id02094" class="calibre1">But, Mendax thought, what if you could learn about how to manipulate a
million-dollar telephone exchange by reading
the manufacturer's technical documentation? How high was
the chance that those documents, which weren't available to the
public, were stored inside NorTel's computer network?</p>

<p id="id02095" class="calibre1">Better still, what if he could find NorTel's original source code—the
software designed to control specific telephone switches, such as the
DMS-100 model. That code might be sitting on a computer hooked into
the worldwide NorTel network. A hacker with access could insert his
own backdoor—a hidden security flaw—before the company sent out
software to its customers.</p>

<p id="id02096" class="calibre1">With a good technical understanding of how NorTel's equipment worked,
combined with a backdoor installed in every piece of software shipped
with a particular product, you could have control over every new
NorTel DMS telephone switch installed from Boston to Bahrain. What
power! Mendax thought, what if you you could turn off 10000 phones in
Rio de Janeiro, or give 5000 New Yorkers free calls one afternoon, or
listen into private telephone conversations in Brisbane. The
telecommunications world would be your oyster.</p>

<p id="id02097" class="calibre1">Like their predecessors, the three IS hackers had started out in the
Melbourne BBS scene. Mendax met Trax on Electric Dreams in about 1988,
and Prime Suspect on Megaworks, where he used the handle Control
Reset, not long after that. When he set up his own BBS at his home in
Tecoma, a hilly suburb so far out of Melbourne that it was practically
in forest, he invited both hackers to visit `A Cute Paranoia' whenever
they could get through on the single phone line.</p>

<p id="id02098" class="calibre1">Visiting on Mendax's BBS suited both hackers, for it was more private
than other BBSes. Eventually they exchanged home telephone numbers,
but only to talk modem-to-modem. For months, they would ring each
other up and type on their computer screens to each other—never
having heard the sound of the other person's voice. Finally, late in
1990, the nineteen-year-old Mendax called up the 24-year-old Trax for
a voice chat. In early 1991, Mendax and Prime Suspect, aged seventeen,
also began speaking in voice on the phone.</p>

<p id="id02099" class="calibre1">Trax seemed slightly eccentric, and possibly suffered from some sort
of anxiety disorder. He refused to travel to the city, and he once
made reference to seeing a psychiatrist. But Mendax usually found the
most interesting people were a little unusual, and Trax was both.</p>

<p id="id02100" class="calibre1">Mendax and Trax discovered they had a few things in common. Both came
from poor but educated families, and both lived in the outer suburbs.
However, they had very different childhoods.</p>

<p id="id02101" class="calibre1">Trax's parents migrated to Australia from Europe. Both his father, a
retired computer technician, and his mother spoke with a German
accent. Trax's father was very much the head of the household, and
Trax was his only son.</p>

<p id="id02102" class="calibre1">By contrast, by the time he was fifteen Mendax had lived in a dozen
different places including Perth, Magnetic Island, Brisbane,
Townsville, Sydney, the Adelaide Hills, and a string of coastal towns
in northern New South Wales and Western Australia. In fifteen years he
had enrolled in at least as many different schools.</p>

<p id="id02103" class="calibre1">His mother had left her Queensland home at age seventeen, after saving
enough money from selling her paintings to buy a motorcycle, a tent
and a road map of Australia. Waving goodbye to her stunned parents,
both academics, she rode off into the sunset. Some 2000 kilometres
later, she arrived in Sydney and joined the thriving counter-culture
community. She worked as an artist and fell in love with a rebellious
young man she met at an anti-Vietnam demonstration.</p>

<p id="id02104" class="calibre1">Within a year of Mendax's birth, his mother's relationship with his
father had ended. When Mendax was two, she married a fellow artist.
What followed was many turbulent years, moving from town to town as
his parents explored the '70s left-wing, bohemian subculture. As a
boy, he was surrounded by artists. His stepfather staged and directed
plays and his mother did make-up, costume and set design.</p>

<p id="id02105" class="calibre1">One night in Adelaide, when Mendax was about four, his mother and a
friend were returning from a meeting of anti-nuclear protesters. The
friend claimed to have scientific evidence that the British had
conducted high-yield, above-ground nuclear tests at Maralinga, a
desert area in north-west South Australia.</p>

<p id="id02106" class="calibre1">A 1984 Royal Commission subsequently revealed that between 1953 and
1963 the British government had tested nuclear bombs at the site,
forcing more than 5000 Aborigines from their native lands. In December
1993, after years of stalling, the British government agreed to pay
[sterling]20 million toward cleaning up the more than 200 square
kilometres of contaminated lands. Back in 1968, however, the Menzies
government had signed away Britain's responsibility to clean up the
site. In the 1970s, the Australian government was still in denial
about exactly what had happened at Maralinga.</p>

<p id="id02107" class="calibre1">As Mendax's mother and her friend drove through an Adelaide suburb
carrying early evidence of the Maralinga tragedy, they noticed they
were being followed by an unmarked car. They tried to lose the tail,
without success. The friend, nervous, said he had to get the data to
an Adelaide journalist before the police could stop him. Mendax's
mother quickly slipped into a back lane and the friend leapt from the
car. She drove off, taking the police tail with her.</p>

<p id="id02108" class="calibre1">The plain-clothed police pulled her over shortly after, searched her
car and demanded to know where her friend had gone and what had
occurred at the meeting. When she was less than helpful, one officer
told her, `You have a child out at 2 in the morning. I think you
should get out of politics, lady. It could be said you were an unfit
mother'.</p>

<p id="id02109" class="calibre1">A few days after this thinly veiled threat, her friend showed up at
Mendax's mother's house, covered in fading bruises. He said the police
had beaten him up, then set him up by planting hash on him. `I'm
getting out of politics,' he announced.</p>

<p id="id02110" class="calibre1">However, she and her husband continued their involvement in theatre.
The young Mendax never dreamed of running away to join the circus—he
already lived the life of a travelling minstrel. But although the
actor-director was a good stepfather, he was also an alcoholic. Not
long after Mendax's ninth birthday, his parents separated and then
divorced.</p>

<p id="id02111" class="calibre1">Mendax's mother then entered a tempestuous relationship with an
amateur musician. Mendax was frightened of the man, whom he considered
a manipulative and violent psychopath. He had five different
identities with plastic in his wallet to match. His whole background
was a fabrication, right down to the country of his birth. When the
relationship ended, the steady pattern of moving around the
countryside began again, but this journey had a very different flavour
from the earlier happy-go-lucky odyssey. This time, Mendax and his
family were on the run from a physically abusive de facto. Finally,
after hiding under assumed names on both sides of the continent,
Mendax and his family settled on the outskirts of Melbourne.</p>

<p id="id02112" class="calibre1">Mendax left home at seventeen because he had received a tip-off about
an impending raid. Mendax wiped his disks, burnt his print-outs and
left. A week later, the Victorian CIB turned up and searched his room,
but found nothing. He married his girlfriend, an intelligent but
introverted and emotionally disturbed sixteen-year-old he had met
through a mutual friend in a gifted children's program. A year later
they had a child.</p>

<p id="id02113" class="calibre1">Mendax made many of his friends through the computer community. He
found Trax easy to talk to and they often spent up to five hours on a
single phone call. Prime Suspect, on the other hand, was hard work on
the phone.</p>

<p id="id02114" class="calibre1">Quiet and introverted, Prime Suspect always seemed to run out of
conversation after five minutes. Mendax was himself naturally shy, so
their talks were often filled with long silences. It wasn't that
Mendax didn't like Prime Suspect, he did. By the time the three
hackers met in person at Trax's home in mid-1991, he considered Prime
Suspect more than just a fellow hacker in the tight-knit IS circle.
Mendax considered him a friend.</p>

<p id="id02115" class="calibre1">Prime Suspect was a boy of veneers. To most of the world, he appeared
to be a studious year 12 student bound for university from his upper
middle-class grammar school. The all-boys school never expected less
from its students and the possibility of attending a TAFE—a
vocational college—was never discussed as an option. University was
the object. Any student who failed to make it was quietly swept under
the carpet like some sort of distasteful food dropping.</p>

<p id="id02116" class="calibre1">Prime Suspect's own family situation did not mirror the veneer of
respectability portrayed by his school. His father, a pharmacist, and
his mother, a nurse, had been in the midst of an acrimonious divorce
battle when his father was diagnosed with terminal cancer. In this
bitter, antagonistic environment, the eight-year-old Prime Suspect was
delivered to his father's bedside in hospice for a rushed few moments
to bid him farewell.</p>

<p id="id02117" class="calibre1">Through much of his childhood and adolescence, Prime Suspect's mother
remained bitter and angry about life, and particularly her
impoverished financial situation. When he was eight, Prime Suspect's
older sister left home at sixteen, moved to Perth and refused to speak
to her mother. In some ways, Prime Suspect felt he was expected be
both child and de facto parent. All of which made him grow up faster
in some ways, but remain immature in others.</p>

<p id="id02118" class="calibre1">Prime Suspect responded to the anger around him by retreating into his
room. When he bought his first computer, an Apple IIe, at age thirteen
he found it better company than any of his relatives. The computers at
school didn't hold much interest for him, since they weren't connected
to the outside world via modem. After reading about BBSes in the Apple
Users' Society newsletter, he saved up for his own modem and soon
began connecting into various BBSes.</p>

<p id="id02119" class="calibre1">School did, however, provide the opportunity to rebel, albeit
anonymously, and he conducted extensive pranking campaigns. Few
teachers suspected the quiet, clean-cut boy and he was rarely caught.
Nature had endowed Prime Suspect with the face of utter innocence.
Tall and slender with brown curly hair, his true character only showed
in the elfish grin which sometimes passed briefly across his baby
face. Teachers told his mother he was underachieving compared to his
level of intelligence, but had few complaints otherwise.</p>

<p id="id02120" class="calibre1">By year 10, he had become a serious hacker and was spending every
available moment at his computer. Sometimes he skipped school, and he
often handed assignments in late. He found it difficult to come up
with ever more creative excuses and sometimes he imagined telling his
teachers the truth. `Sorry I didn't get that 2000-word paper done but
I was knee-deep in NASA networks last night.' The thought made him
laugh.</p>

<p id="id02121" class="calibre1">He saw girls as a unwanted distraction from hacking. Sometimes, after
he chatted with a girl at a party, his friends would later ask him why
he hadn't asked her out. Prime Suspect shrugged it off. The real
reason was that he would rather get home to his computer, but he never
discussed his hacking with anyone at school, not even with Mentat.</p>

<p id="id02122" class="calibre1">A friend of Force's and occasional visitor to The Realm, Mentat was
two years ahead of Prime Suspect at school and in general couldn't be
bothered talking to so junior a hacker as Prime Suspect. The younger
hacker didn't mind. He had witnessed other hackers' indiscretions,
wanted no part of them and was happy to keep his hacking life private.</p>

<p id="id02123" class="calibre1">Before the Realm bust, Phoenix rang him up once at 2 a.m. suggesting
that he and Nom come over there and then. Woken by the call, Prime
Suspect's mother stood in the doorway to his bedroom, remonstrating
with him for letting his `friends' call at such a late hour. With
Phoenix goading him in one ear, and his mother chewing him out in the
other, Prime Suspect decided the whole thing was a bad idea. He said
no thanks to Phoenix, and shut the door on his mother.</p>

<p id="id02124" class="calibre1">He did, however, talk to Powerspike on the phone once in a while. The
older hacker's highly irreverent attitude and Porky Pig laugh appealed
to him. But other than those brief talks, Prime Suspect avoided
talking on the phone to people outside the International Subversives,
especially when he and Mendax moved into ever more sensitive military
computers.</p>

<p id="id02125" class="calibre1">Using a program called Sycophant written by Mendax, the IS hackers had
been conducting massive attacks on the US military. They divided up
Sycophant on eight attack machines, often choosing university systems
at places like the Australian National University or the University of
Texas. They pointed the eight machines at the targets and fired.
Within six hours, the eight machines had assaulted thousands of
computers. The hackers sometimes reaped 100000 accounts each night.</p>

<p id="id02126" class="calibre1">Using Sycophant, they essentially forced a cluster of Unix machines in
a computer network to attack the entire Internet en masse.</p>

<p id="id02127" class="calibre1">And that was just the start of what they were into. They had been in
so many sites they often couldn't remember if they
had actually hacked a particular computer. The places they could
recall read like a Who's Who of the American military-industrial
complex. The US Airforce 7th Command Group Headquarters in the
Pentagon. Stanford Research Institute in California. Naval Surface
Warfare Center in Virginia. Lockheed Martin's Tactical Aircraft
Systems Air Force Plant in Texas. Unisys Corporation in Blue Bell,
Pennsylvania. Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA. Motorola Inc. in
Illinois. TRW Inc. in Redondo Beach, California. Alcoa in Pittsburgh.
Panasonic Corp in New Jersey. US Naval Undersea Warfare Engineering
Station. Siemens-Nixdorf Information Systems in Massachusetts.
Securities Industry Automation Corp in New York. Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory in California. Bell Communications Research, New
Jersey. Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, California.</p>

<p id="id02128" class="calibre1">As the IS hackers reached a level of sophistication beyond anything
The Realm had achieved, they realised that progress carried
considerable risk and began to withdraw completely from the broader
Australian hacking community. Soon they had drawn a tight circle
around themselves. They talked only to each other.</p>

<p id="id02129" class="calibre1">Watching the Realm hackers go down hadn't deterred the next generation
of hackers. It had only driven them further underground.</p>

<p id="id02130" class="calibre1">In the spring of 1991, Prime Suspect and Mendax began a race to get<br class="calibre4"/>

root on the US Department of Defense's Network Information Center<br class="calibre4"/>

(NIC) computer—potentially the most important computer on the<br class="calibre4"/>

Internet.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02131" class="calibre1">As both hackers chatted amiably on-line one night, on a Melbourne
University computer, Prime Suspect worked quietly in another screen to
penetrate ns.nic.ddn.mil, a US Department of Defense system closely
linked to NIC. He believed the sister system and NIC might `trust'
each other—a trust he could exploit to get into NIC. And NIC did
everything.</p>

<p id="id02132" class="calibre1">NIC assigned domain names—the `.com' or `.net' at the end of an email
address—for the entire Internet. NIC also controlled the US
military's own internal defence data network, known as MILNET.</p>

<p id="id02133" class="calibre1">NIC also published the communication protocol standards for all of the
Internet. Called RFCs (Request for Comments), these technical
specifications allowed one computer on the Internet to talk to
another. The Defense Data Network Security Bulletins, the US
Department of Defense's equivalent of CERT advisories, came from the
NIC machine.</p>

<p id="id02134" class="calibre1">Perhaps most importantly, NIC controlled the reverse look-up service
on the Internet. Whenever someone connects to another site across the
Internet, he or she typically types in the site name—say,
ariel.unimelb.edu.au at the University of Melbourne. The computer then
translates the alphabetical name into a numerical address—the IP
address—in this case 128.250.20.3. All the computers on the Internet
need this IP address to relay the packets of data onto the final
destination computer. NIC decided how Internet computers would
translate the alphabetical name into an IP address, and vice versa.</p>

<p id="id02135" class="calibre1">If you controlled NIC, you had phenomenal power on the Internet. You
could, for example, simply make Australia disappear. Or you could turn
it into Brazil. By pointing all Internet addresses ending in
`.au'—the designation for sites in Australia—to Brazil, you could
cut Australia's part of the Internet off from the rest of the world
and send all Australian Internet traffic to Brazil. In fact, by
changing the delegation of all the domain names, you could virtually
stop the flow of information between all the countries on the
Internet.</p>

<p id="id02136" class="calibre1">The only way someone could circumvent this power was by typing in the
full numerical IP address instead of a proper alphabetical address.
But few people knew the up-to-twelve-digit IP equivalent of their
alphabetical addresses, and fewer still actually used them.</p>

<p id="id02137" class="calibre1">Controlling NIC offered other benefits as well. Control NIC, and you
owned a virtual pass-key into any computer on the Internet which
`trusted' another. And most machines trust at least one other system.</p>

<p id="id02138" class="calibre1">Whenever one computer connects to another across the Net, both
machines go through a special meet-and-greet process. The receiving
computer looks over the first machine and asks itself
a few questions. What's the name of the incoming machine?
Is that name allowed to connect to me? In what ways am I
programmed to `trust' that machine—to wave my normal security for
connections from that system?</p>

<p id="id02139" class="calibre1">The receiving computer answers these questions based in large part on
information provided by NIC. All of which means that, by controlling
NIC, you could make any computer on the Net `pose' as a machine
trusted by a computer you might want to hack. Security often depended
on a computer's name, and NIC effectively controlled that name.</p>

<p id="id02140" class="calibre1">When Prime Suspect managed to get inside NIC's sister system, he told
Mendax and gave him access to the computer. Each hacker then began his
own attack on NIC. When Mendax finally got root on NIC, the power was
intoxicating. Prime Suspect got root at the same time but using a
different method. They were both in.</p>

<p id="id02141" class="calibre1">Inside NIC, Mendax began by inserting a backdoor—a method of getting
back into the computer at a later date in case an admin repaired the
security flaws the hackers had used to get into the machine. From now
on, if he telnetted into the system's Data Defense Network (DDN)
information server and typed `login 0' he would have instant,
invisible root access to NIC.</p>

<p id="id02142" class="calibre1">That step completed, he looked around for interesting things to read.
One file held what appeared to be a list of satellite and microwave
dish coordinates—longitude, latitudes, transponder frequencies. Such
coordinates might in theory allow someone to build a complete map of
communications devices which were used to move the DOD's computer data
around the world.</p>

<p id="id02143" class="calibre1">Mendax also penetrated MILNET's Security Coordination Center, which
collected reports on every possible security incident on a MILNET
computer. Those computers—largely TOPS-20s made by DEC—contained
good automatic security programs. Any number of out-of-the-ordinary
events would trigger an automatic security report. Someone logging
into a machine for too long. A large number of failed login attempts,
suggesting password guessing. Two people logging into the same account
at the same time. Alarm bells would go off and the local computer
would immediately send a security violation report to the MILNET
security centre, where it would be added to the `hot list'.</p>

<p id="id02144" class="calibre1">Mendax flipped through page after page of MILNET's security reports on
his screen. Most looked like nothing—MILNET users accidentally
stumbling over a security tripwire—but one notice from a US military
site in Germany stood out. It was not computer generated. This was
from a real human being. The system admin reported that someone had
been repeatedly trying to break into his or her machine, and had
eventually managed to get in. The admin was trying, without much luck,
to trace back the intruder's connection to its point of origin. Oddly,
it appeared to originate in another MILNET system.</p>

<p id="id02145" class="calibre1">Riffling through other files, Mendax found mail confirming that the
attack had indeed come from inside MILNET. His eyes grew wide as he
read on. US military hackers had broken into MILNET systems, using
them for target practice, and no-one had bothered to tell the system
admin at the target site.</p>

<p id="id02146" class="calibre1">Mendax couldn't believe it. The US military was hacking its own
computers. This discovery led to another, more disturbing, thought. If
the US military was hacking its own computers for practice, what was
it doing to other countries' computers?</p>

<p id="id02147" class="calibre1">As he quietly backed out of the system, wiping away his footprints as
he tip-toed away, Mendax thought about what he had seen. He was deeply
disturbed that any hacker would work for the US military.</p>

<p id="id02148" class="calibre1">Hackers, he thought, should be anarchists, not hawks.</p>

<p id="id02149" class="calibre1">In early October 1991, Mendax rang Trax and gave him the dial-up and
account details for NMELH1.</p>

<p id="id02150" class="calibre1">Trax wasn't much of a hacker, but Mendax admired his phreaking
talents. Trax was the father of phreaking in Australia and Trax's
Toolbox, his guide to the art of phreaking, was
legendary. Mendax thought Trax might find some interesting detailed
information inside the NorTel network on how to
control telephone switches.</p>

<p id="id02151" class="calibre1">Trax invented multi-frequency code phreaking. By sending special
tones—generated by his computer program—down the phone line, he
could control certain functions in the telephone exchange. Many
hackers had learned how to make free phone calls by charging the cost
to someone else or to calling cards, but Trax discovered how to make
phone calls which weren't charged to anyone. The calls weren't just
free; they were untraceable.</p>

<p id="id02152" class="calibre1">Trax wrote 48 pages on his discovery and called it The Australian
Phreakers Manual Volumes 1-7. But as he added more and more to the
manual, he became worried what would happen if he released it in the
underground, so he decided he would only show it to the other two
International Subversive hackers.</p>

<p id="id02153" class="calibre1">He went on to publish The Advanced Phreaker's Manual,2 a second
edition of the manual, in The International Subversive, the
underground magazine edited by Mendax:</p>

<p id="id02154" class="calibre1">An electronic magazine, The International Subversive had a simple
editorial policy. You could only have a copy of the magazine if you
wrote an `article'. The policy was a good way of protecting against
nappies—sloppy or inexperienced hackers who might accidentally draw
police attention. Nappies also tended to abuse good phreaking and
hacking techniques, which might cause Telecom to close up security
holes. The result was that IS had a circulation of just three people.</p>

<p id="id02155" class="calibre1">To a non-hacker, IS looked like gobbledygook—the phone book made more
interesting reading. But to a member of the computer underground, IS
was a treasure map. A good hacker could follow the trail of modem
phone numbers and passwords, then use the directions in IS to
disappear through secret entrances into the labyrinth of forbidden
computer networks. Armed with the magazine, he could slither out of
tight spots, outwit system admins and find the treasure secreted in
each computer system.</p>

<p id="id02156" class="calibre1">For Prime Suspect and Mendax, who were increasingly paranoid about
line traces from the university modems they used as launchpads, Trax's
phreaking skills were a gift from heaven.</p>

<p id="id02157" class="calibre1">Trax made his great discovery by accident. He was using a phone
sprinter, a simple computer program which automatically dialled a
range of phone numbers looking for modems. If he turned the volume up
on his modem when his computer dialled what seemed to be a dead or
non-existent number, he sometimes heard a soft clicking noise after
the disconnection message. The noise sounded like faint heartbeats.</p>

<p id="id02158" class="calibre1">Curious, he experimented with these strange numbers and soon
discovered they were disconnected lines which had not yet been
reassigned. He wondered how he could use these odd numbers. After
reading a document Mendax had found in Britain and uploaded to The
Devil's Playground, another BBS, Trax had an idea. The posting
provided information about CCITT #5 signalling tones, CCITT being the
international standard—the language spoken by telephone exchanges
between countries.</p>

<p id="id02159" class="calibre1">When you make an international phone call from Australia to the US,
the call passes from the local telephone exchange to an international
gateway exchange within Australia. From there, it travels to an
exchange in the US. The CCITT signalling tones were the special tones
the two international gateway exchanges used to communicate with each
other.</p>

<p id="id02160" class="calibre1">Telecom Australia adapted a later version of this standard, called R2,
for use on its own domestic exchanges. Telecom called this new
standard MFC, or multi-frequency code. When, say, Trax rang Mendax,
his exchange asked Mendax's to `talk' to Mendax's phone by using these
tones. Mendax's exchange `answered', perhaps saying Mendax's phone was
busy or disconnected. The Telecom-adapted tones—pairs of audio
frequencies—did not exist in normal telephone keypads and you
couldn't make them simply by punching keys on your household
telephone.</p>

<p id="id02161" class="calibre1">Trax wrote a program which allowed his Amstrad computer to generate the
special tones and send them down the phone line. In an act many in the
underground later considered to be a stroke of genius, he began to map
out exactly what each tone did. It was a difficult task, since one tone
could mean several different things at each stage of the `conversation'
between two exchanges.</p>

<p id="id02162" class="calibre1">Passionate about his new calling, Trax went trashing in Telecom
garbage bins, where he found an MFC register list—an invaluable piece
of his puzzle. Using the list, along with pieces of overseas phreaking
files and a great deal of painstaking hands-on effort, Trax slowly
learned the language of the Australian telephone exchanges. Then he
taught the language to his computer.</p>

<p id="id02163" class="calibre1">Trax tried calling one of the `heartbeat' phone numbers again. He
began playing his special, computer-generated tones through an
amplifier. In simple terms, he was able to fool other exchanges into
thinking he was his local Telecom exchange. More accurately, Trax had
made his exchange drop him into the outgoing signalling trunk that had
been used to route to the disconnected phone number.</p>

<p id="id02164" class="calibre1">Trax could now call out—anywhere—as if he was calling from a point
halfway between his own phone and the disconnected number. If he
called a modem at Melbourne University, for instance, and the line was
being traced, his home phone number would not show up on the trace
records. No-one would be charged for the call because Trax's calls
were ghosts in the phone system.</p>

<p id="id02165" class="calibre1">Trax continued to refine his ability to manipulate both the telephone
and the exchange. He took his own telephone apart, piece by piece,
countless times, fiddling with the parts until he understood exactly
how it worked. Within months, he was able to do far more than just
make free phone calls. He could, for instance, make a line trace think
that he had come from a specific telephone number.</p>

<p id="id02166" class="calibre1">He and Mendax joked that if they called a `hot' site they would use<br class="calibre4"/>

Trax's technique to send the line trace—and the bill—back to one<br class="calibre4"/>

very special number. The one belonging to the AFP's Computer Crime<br class="calibre4"/>

Unit in Melbourne.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02167" class="calibre1">All three IS hackers suspected the AFP was close on their heels.
Roving through the Canberra-based computer system belonging to the man
who essentially ran the Internet in Australia, Geoff Huston, they
watched the combined efforts of police and the Australian Academic and
Research Network (AARNET) to trace them.</p>

<p id="id02168" class="calibre1">Craig Warren of Deakin University had written to Huston, AARNET
technical manager, about hacker attacks on university systems. Huston
had forwarded a copy of the letter to Peter Elford, who assisted
Huston in managing AARNET. The hackers broke into Huston's system and
also read the letter:</p>

<p id="id02178" class="calibre1">From: Craig Warren &lt;C.Warren@deakin.OZ.AU&gt;</p>

<p id="id02179" class="calibre5">Just to give you a little bit of an idea about what has been
happening since we last spoke…</p>

<p id="id02180" class="calibre5">We have communicated with Sgt Ken Day of the Federal Police about 100
times in the last week. Together with our counterparts from
Warrnambool traces have been arranged on dial-in lines and on Austpac
lines for the capella.cc.deakin.OZ.AU terminal server which was left
open to the world.</p>

<p id="id02181" class="calibre5">On Friday afternoon we were able to trace a call back to a person in
the Warrnambool telephone district. The police have this persons name.
We believe others are involved, as we have seen up to 3 people active
at any one time. It is `suspected' students from RMIT and perhaps
students from Deakin are also involved.</p>

<p id="id02182" class="calibre5">When I left on Friday night, there was plenty of activity still and
the police and Telecom were tracking down another number.</p>

<p id="id02183" class="calibre5">Tomorrow morning I will talk to all parties involved, but it is
likely we will have the names of at least 2 or 3 people that are
involved. We will probably shut down access of `cappella' to AARNet at
this stage, and let the police go about their business of prosecuting
these people.</p>

<p id="id02184" class="calibre5">You will be `pleased' (:-)) to know you have not been the only ones
under attack. I know of at least 2 other sites in Victoria that have
had people attacking them. One of them was Telecom which helped get
Telecom involved!</p>

<p id="id02185" class="calibre5">I will brief you all in the next day or so as to what has happened.</p>

<p id="id02186" class="calibre5">Regards, Craig</p>

<p id="id02187" class="calibre5">The `other' people were, of course, the IS hackers. There is nothing
like reading about your own hacking antics in some one's security
mail.</p>

<p id="id02188" class="calibre1">Mendax and Prime Suspect frequently visited ANU's computers to read
the security mail there. However, universities were usually nothing
special, just jumping-off points and, occasionally, good sources of
information on how close the AFP were to closing in on the IS hackers.</p>

<p id="id02189" class="calibre1">Far more interesting to Mendax were his initial forays into Telecom's
exchanges. Using a modem number Prime Suspect had found, he dialled
into what he suspected was Telecom's Lonsdale Exchange in downtown
Melbourne. When his modem connected to another one, all he saw was a
blank screen. He tried a few basic commands which might give him help
to understand the system:</p>

<p id="id02190" class="calibre1">Login. List. Attach.</p>

<p id="id02191" class="calibre1">The exchange's computer remained silent.</p>

<p id="id02192" class="calibre1">Mendax ran a program he had written to fire off every recognised
keyboard character—256 of them—at another machine. Nothing again. He
then tried the break signal—the Amiga key and the character B pressed
simultaneously. That got an answer of sorts.</p>

<p id="id02193" class="calibre1">:</p>

<p id="id02194" class="calibre1">He pulled up another of his hacking tools, a program which dumped 200
common commands to the other machine. Nothing. Finally, he tried
typing `logout'. That gave him an answer:</p>

<p id="id02195" class="calibre1">error, not logged on</p>

<p id="id02196" class="calibre1">Ah, thought Mendax. The command is `logon' not `login'.</p>

<p id="id02197" class="calibre1">:logon</p>

<p id="id02198" class="calibre1">The Telecom exchange answered: `username:' Now all Mendax had to do
was figure out a username and password.</p>

<p id="id02199" class="calibre1">He knew that Telecom used NorTel equipment. More than likely, NorTel
staff were training Telecom workers and would need access themselves.
If there were lots of NorTel employees working on many different phone
switches, it would be difficult to pass on secure passwords to staff
all the time. NorTel and Telecom people would probably pick something
easy and universal. What password best fitted that description?</p>

<p id="id02200" class="calibre1">username: nortel</p>

<p id="id02201" class="calibre1">password: nortel</p>

<p id="id02202" class="calibre1">It worked.</p>

<p id="id02203" class="calibre1">Unfortunately, Mendax didn't know which commands to use once he got
into the machine, and there was no on-line documentation to provide
help. The telephone switch had its own language, unlike anything he
had ever encountered before.</p>
