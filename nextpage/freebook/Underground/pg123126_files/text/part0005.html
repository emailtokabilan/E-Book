Meredith had asked Gill for verification and he had referred her to<br class="calibre4"/>

Superintendent Tony Warren, of the Victoria Police, who had backed him<br class="calibre4"/>

up. A reporter couldn't ask for better verification than that.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01187" class="calibre1">And why wouldn't Warren back Gill? A registered ISU informer, Gill
also acted as a consultant, adviser, confidant and friend to various
members of the Victoria Police. He was close to both Warren and,
later, to Inspector Chris Cosgriff. From 1985 to 1987, Warren had
worked at the Bureau of Criminal Intelligence (BCI). After that, he
was transferred to the Internal Investigations Department (IID), where
he worked with Cosgriff who joined IID in 1988.</p>

<p id="id01188" class="calibre1">Over a six-month period in 1992, Tony Warren received more than 200
phone calls from Stuart Gill—45 of them to his home number. Over an
eighteen-month period in 1991-92, Chris Cosgriff made at least 76
personal visits to Gill's home address and recorded 316 phone calls
with him.3</p>

<p id="id01189" class="calibre1">The Internal Security Unit (ISU) investigated corruption within the
police force. If you had access to ISU, you knew everything that the
Victoria Police officially knew about corruption within its ranks. Its
information was highly sensitive, particularly since it could involve
one police officer dobbing in another. However, a 1993 Victorian
Ombudsman's report concluded that Cosgriff leaked a large amount of
confidential ISU material to Gill, and that Warren's relationship with
Gill was inappropriate.4</p>

<p id="id01190" class="calibre1">When Craig Bowen (aka Thunderbird1) came to believe in 1989 that he
had been duped by Gill, he retreated into a state of denial and
depression. The PI community had trusted him. He entered his
friendship with Gill a bright-eyed, innocent young man looking for
adventure. He left the friendship betrayed and gun-shy.</p>

<p id="id01191" class="calibre1">Sad-eyed and feeling dark on the world, Craig Bowen turned off PI and<br class="calibre4"/>

Zen forever.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01192" class="calibre2">Sitting at his computer sometime in the second half of 1989, Force
stared at his screen without seeing anything, his mind a million miles
away. The situation was bad, very bad, and lost in thought, he toyed
with his mouse absent-mindedly, thinking about how to deal with this
problem.</p>

<p id="id01193" class="calibre1">The problem was that someone in Melbourne was going to be busted.</p>

<p id="id01194" class="calibre1">Force wanted to discount the secret warning, to rack it up as just
another in a long line of rumours which swept through the underground
periodically, but he knew he couldn't do that. The warning was rock
solid; it had come from Gavin.*</p>

<p id="id01195" class="calibre1">The way Force told it, his friend Gavin worked as a contractor to
Telecom by day and played at hacking at night. He was Force's little
secret, who he kept from the other members of The Realm. Gavin was
definitely not part of the hacker BBS scene. He was older, he didn't
even have a handle and he hacked alone, or with Force, because he saw
hacking in groups as risky.</p>

<p id="id01196" class="calibre1">As a Telecom contractor, Gavin had the kind of access to computers and
networks which most hackers could only dream about. He also had good
contacts inside Telecom—the kind who might answer a few tactfully
worded questions about telephone taps and line traces, or might know a
bit about police investigations requiring Telecom's help.</p>

<p id="id01197" class="calibre1">Force had met Gavin while buying some second-hand equipment through
the Trading Post. They hit it off, became friends and soon began
hacking together. Under the cover of darkness, they would creep into
Gavin's office after everyone else had gone home and hack all night.
At dawn, they tidied up and quietly left the building. Gavin went
home, showered and returned to work as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p id="id01198" class="calibre1">Gavin introduced Force to trashing. When they weren't spending the
night in front of his terminal, Gavin crawled through Telecom's
dumpsters looking for pearls of information on crumpled bits of office
paper. Account names, passwords, dial-up modems, NUAs—people wrote
all sorts of things down on scrap paper and then threw it out the next
day when they didn't need it any more.</p>

<p id="id01199" class="calibre1">According to Force, Gavin moved offices frequently, which made it
easier to muddy the trail. Even better, he worked from offices which
had dozens of employees making hundreds of calls each day. Gavin and
Force's illicit activities were buried under a mound of daily
legitimate transactions.</p>

<p id="id01200" class="calibre1">The two hackers trusted each other; in fact Gavin was the only person
to whom Force revealed the exact address of the CitiSaudi machine. Not
even Phoenix, rising star of The Realm and Force's favoured protégé,
was privy to all the secrets of Citibank uncovered during Force's
network explorations.</p>

<p id="id01201" class="calibre1">Force had shared some of this glittering prize with Phoenix, but not
all of it. Just a few of the Citibank cards—token trophies—and
general information about the Citibank network. Believing the
temptation to collect vast numbers of cards and use them would be too
great for the young Phoenix, Force tried to keep the exact location of
the Citibank machine a secret. He knew that Phoenix might eventually
find the Citibank system on his own, and there was little he could do
to stop him. But Force was determined that he wouldn't help Phoenix
get himself into trouble.</p>

<p id="id01202" class="calibre1">The Citibank network had been a rich source of systems—something
Force also kept to himself. The more he explored, the more he found in
the network. Soon after his first discovery of the CitiSaudi system,
he found a machine called CitiGreece which was just as willing to dump
card details as its Saudi-American counterpart. Out of fifteen or so
credit cards Force discovered on the system, only two appeared to be
valid. He figured the others were test cards and that this must be a
new site. Not long after the discovery of the CitiGreece machine, he
discovered similar embryonic sites in two other countries.</p>

<p id="id01203" class="calibre1">Force liked Phoenix and was impressed by the new hacker's enthusiasm
and desire to learn about computer networks.</p>

<p id="id01204" class="calibre1">Force introduced Phoenix to Minerva, just as Craig Bowen had done for
Force some years before. Phoenix learned quickly and came back for
more. He was hungry and, in Force's discerning opinion, very bright.
Indeed, Force saw a great deal of himself in the young hacker. They
were from a similarly comfortable, educated middle-class background.
They were also both a little outside the mainstream. Force's family
were migrants to Australia. Some of Phoenix's family lived in Israel,
and his family was very religious.</p>

<p id="id01205" class="calibre1">Phoenix attended one of the most Orthodox Jewish schools in Victoria,
a place which described itself as a `modern orthodox Zionist'
institution. Nearly half the subjects offered in year 9 were in Jewish
Studies, all the boys wore yarmulkes and the school expected students
to be fluent in Hebrew by the time they graduated.</p>

<p id="id01206" class="calibre1">In his first years at the school, Phoenix had acquired the nickname
`The Egg'. Over the following years he became a master at playing the
game—jumping through hoops to please teachers. He learned that doing
well in religious studies was a good way to ingratiate himself to
teachers, as well as his parents and, in their eyes at least, he
became the golden-haired boy.</p>

<p id="id01207" class="calibre1">Anyone scratching below the surface, however, would find the shine of
the golden-haired boy was merely gilt. Despite his success in school
and his matriculation, Phoenix was having trouble. He had been
profoundly affected by the bitter break-up and divorce of his parents
when he was about fourteen.</p>

<p id="id01208" class="calibre1">After the divorce, Phoenix was sent to boarding school in Israel for
about six months. On his return to Melbourne, he lived with his
younger sister and mother at his maternal grandmother's house. His
brother, the middle child, lived with his father.</p>

<p id="id01209" class="calibre1">School friends sometimes felt awkward visiting Phoenix at home. One of
his best friends found it difficult dealing with Phoenix's mother,
whose vivacity sometimes bordered on the neurotic and shrill. His
grandmother was a chronic worrier, who pestered Phoenix about using
the home phone line during thunderstorms for fear he would be
electrocuted. The situation with Phoenix's father wasn't much better.
A manager at Telecom, he seemed to waver between appearing
disinterested or emotionally cold and breaking into violent outbursts
of anger.</p>

<p id="id01210" class="calibre1">But it was Phoenix's younger brother who seemed to be the problem
child. He ran away from home at around seventeen and dealt in drugs
before eventually finding his feet. Yet, unlike Phoenix, his brother's
problems had been laid bare for all to see. Hitting rock bottom forced
him to take stock of his life and come to terms with his situation.</p>

<p id="id01211" class="calibre1">In contrast, Phoenix found less noticeable ways of expressing his
rebellion. Among them was his enthusiasm for tools of power—the
martial arts, weapons such as swords and staffs, and social
engineering. During his final years of secondary school, while still
living at his grandmother's home, Phoenix took up hacking. He hung
around various Melbourne BBSes, and then he developed an on-line
friendship with Force.</p>

<p id="id01212" class="calibre1">Force watched Phoenix's hacking skills develop with interest and after
a couple of months he invited him to join The Realm. It was the
shortest initiation of any Realm member, and the vote to include the
new hacker was unanimous. Phoenix proved to be a valuable member,
collecting information about new systems and networks for The Realm's
databases. At their peak of hacking activity, Force and Phoenix spoke
on the phone almost every day.</p>

<p id="id01213" class="calibre1">Phoenix's new-found acceptance contrasted with the position of<br class="calibre4"/>

Electron, who visited The Realm regularly for a few months in 1988. As<br class="calibre4"/>

Phoenix basked in the warmth of Force's approval, the<br class="calibre4"/>

eighteen-year-old Electron felt the chill of his increasing scorn.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01214" class="calibre1">Force eventually turfed Electron and his friend, Powerspike, out of
his exclusive Melbourne club of hackers. Well, that was how Force told
it. He told the other members of The Realm that Electron had committed
two major sins. The first was that he had been wasting resources by
using accounts on OTC's Minerva system to connect to Altos, which
meant the accounts would be immediately tracked and killed.</p>

<p id="id01215" class="calibre1">Minerva admins such as Michael Rosenberg—sworn enemy of The<br class="calibre4"/>

Realm—recognised the Altos NUA. Rosenberg was OTC's best defence<br class="calibre4"/>

against hackers. He had spent so much time trying to weed them out of<br class="calibre4"/>

Minerva that he knew their habits by heart: hack, then zoom over to<br class="calibre4"/>

Altos for a chat with fellow hackers, then hack some more.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01216" class="calibre1">Most accounts on Minerva were held by corporations. How many
legitimate users from ANZ Bank would visit Altos? None. So when
Rosenberg saw an account connecting to Altos, he silently observed
what the hacker was doing—in case he bragged on the German chat
board—then changed the password and notified the client, in an effort
to lock the hacker out for good.</p>

<p id="id01217" class="calibre1">Electron's second sin, according to Force, was that he had been
withholding hacking information from the rest of the group. Force's
stated view—though it didn't seem to apply to him personally—was one
in, all in.</p>

<p id="id01218" class="calibre1">It was a very public expulsion. Powerspike and Electron told each
other they didn't really care. As they saw it, they might have visited
The Realm BBS now and then but they certainly weren't members of The
Realm. Electron joked with Powerspike, `Who would want to be a member
of a no-talent outfit like The Realm?' Still, it must have hurt.
Hackers in the period 1988-90 depended on each other for information.
They honed their skills in a community which shared intelligence and
they grew to rely on the pool of information.</p>

<p id="id01219" class="calibre1">Months later, Force grudgingly allowing Electron to rejoin The Realm,
but the relationship remained testy. When Electron finally logged in
again, he found a file in the BBS entitled `Scanner stolen from the
Electron'. Force had found a copy of Electron's VMS scanner on an
overseas computer while Electron was in exile and had felt no qualms
about pinching it for The Realm.</p>

<p id="id01220" class="calibre1">Except that it wasn't a scanner. It was a VMS Trojan. And there was a
big difference. It didn't scan for the addresses of computers on a
network. It snagged passwords when people connected from their VMS
computers to another machine over an X.25 network. Powerspike cracked
up laughing when Electron told him. `Well,' he told Powerspike, `Mr
Bigshot Force might know something about Prime computers, but he
doesn't know a hell of a lot about VMS.'</p>

<p id="id01221" class="calibre1">Despite Electron's general fall from grace, Phoenix talked to the
outcast because they shared the obsession. Electron was on a steep
learning curve and, like Phoenix, he was moving fast—much faster than
any of the other Melbourne hackers.</p>

<p id="id01222" class="calibre1">When Phoenix admitted talking to Electron regularly, Force tried to
pull him away, but without luck. Some of the disapproval was born of
Force's paternalistic attitude toward the Australian hacking scene. He
considered himself to be a sort of godfather in the hacking community.
But Force was also increasingly concerned at Phoenix's ever more
flagrant taunting of computer security bigwigs and system admins. In
one incident, Phoenix knew a couple of system admins and security
people were waiting on a system to trap him by tracing his network
connections. He responded by sneaking into the computer unnoticed and
quietly logging off each admin. Force laughed about it at the time,
but privately the story made him more than a little nervous.</p>

<p id="id01223" class="calibre1">Phoenix enjoyed pitting himself against the pinnacles of the computer
security industry. He wanted to prove he was better, and he frequently
upset people because often he was. Strangely, though, Force's protégé
also thought that if he told these experts about a few of the holes in
their systems, he would somehow gain their approval. Maybe they would
even give him inside information, like new penetration techniques,
and, importantly, look after him if things got rough. Force wondered
how Phoenix could hold two such conflicting thoughts in his mind at
the same time without questioning the logic of either.</p>

<p id="id01224" class="calibre1">It was against this backdrop that Gavin came to Force with his urgent
warning in late 1989. Gavin had learned that the Australian Federal
Police were getting complaints about hackers operating out of
Melbourne. The Melbourne hacking community had become very noisy and
was leaving footprints all over the place as its members traversed the
world's data networks.</p>

<p id="id01225" class="calibre1">There were other active hacking communities outside Australia—in the
north of England, in Texas, in New York. But the Melbourne hackers
weren't just noisy—they were noisy inside American computers. It
wasn't just a case of American hackers breaking into American systems.
This was about foreign nationals penetrating American computers. And
there was something else which made the Australian hackers a target.
The US Secret Service knew an Australian named Phoenix had been inside
Citibank, one of the biggest financial institutions in the US.</p>

<p id="id01226" class="calibre1">Gavin didn't have many details to give Force. All he knew was that an
American law enforcement agency—probably the Secret Service—had been
putting enormous pressure on the Australian government to bust these
people.</p>

<p id="id01227" class="calibre1">What Gavin didn't know was that the Secret Service wasn't the only
source of pressure coming from the other side of the Pacific. The FBI
had also approached the Australian Federal Police about the mysterious
but noisy Australian hackers who kept breaking into American systems,5
and the AFP had acted on the information.</p>

<p id="id01228" class="calibre1">In late 1989, Detective Superintendent Ken Hunt of the AFP headed an
investigation into the Melbourne hackers. It was believed to be the
first major investigation of computer crime since the introduction of
Australia's first federal anti-hacking laws. Like most law enforcement
agencies around the world, the AFP were new players in the field of
computer crime. Few officers had expertise in computers, let alone
computer crime, so this case would prove to be an important proving
ground.6</p>

<p id="id01229" class="calibre1">When Gavin broke the news, Force acted immediately. He called Phoenix
on the phone, insisting on meeting him in person as soon as possible.
As their friendship had progressed, they had moved from talking
on-line to telephone conversations and finally to spending time
together in person. Force sat Phoenix down alone and gave him a stern
warning. He didn't tell him how he got his information, but he made it
clear the source was reliable.</p>

<p id="id01230" class="calibre1">The word was that the police felt they had to bust someone. It had
come to the point where an American law enforcement officer had
reportedly told his Australian counterpart, `If you don't do something
about it soon, we'll do something about it ourselves'. The American
hadn't bothered to elaborate on just how they might do something about
it, but it didn't matter.</p>

<p id="id01231" class="calibre1">Phoenix looked suddenly pale. He had certainly been very noisy, and
was breaking into systems virtually all the time now. Many of those
systems were in the US.</p>

<p id="id01232" class="calibre1">He certainly didn't want to end up like the West German hacker<br class="calibre4"/>

Hagbard, whose petrol-doused, charred remains had been discovered in a<br class="calibre4"/>

German forest in June 1989.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01233" class="calibre1">An associate of Pengo's, Hagbard had been involved in a ring of German
hackers who sold the information they found in American computers to a
KGB agent in East Germany from 1986 to 1988.</p>

<p id="id01234" class="calibre1">In March 1989, German police raided the homes and offices of the
German hacking group and began arresting people. Like Pengo, Hagbard
had secretly turned himself into the German authorities months before
and given full details of the hacking ring's activities in the hope of
gaining immunity from prosecution.</p>

<p id="id01235" class="calibre1">American law enforcement agencies and prosecutors had not been
enthusiastic about showing the hackers any leniency. Several US
agencies, including the CIA and the FBI, had been chasing the German
espionage ring and they wanted stiff sentences, preferably served in
an American prison.</p>

<p id="id01236" class="calibre1">German court proceedings were under way when Hagbard's body was found.
Did he commit suicide or was he murdered? No-one knew for sure, but
the news shook the computer underground around the world. Hackers
discussed the issue in considerable depth. On the one hand, Hagbard
had a long history of mental instability and drug use, having spent
time in psychiatric hospitals and detoxification centres off and on
since the beginning of 1987. On the other hand, if you were going to
kill yourself, would you really want to die in the agony of a petrol
fire? Or would you just take a few too many pills or a quick bullet?</p>

<p id="id01237" class="calibre1">Whether it was murder or suicide, the death of Hagbard loomed large
before Phoenix. Who were the American law enforcement agencies after
in Australia? Did they want him?</p>

<p id="id01238" class="calibre1">No. Force reassured him, they were after Electron. The problem for
Phoenix was that he kept talking to Electron on the phone—in voice
conversations. If Phoenix continued associating with Electron, he too
would be scooped up in the AFP's net.</p>

<p id="id01239" class="calibre1">The message to Phoenix was crystal clear.</p>

<p id="id01240" class="calibre1">Stay away from Electron.</p>

<p id="id01241" class="calibre2">`Listen, you miserable scum-sucking pig.'</p>

<p id="id01242" class="calibre1">`Huh?' Phoenix answered, only half paying attention.</p>

<p id="id01243" class="calibre1">`Piece of shit machine. I did all this editing and the damn thing
didn't save the changes,' Electron growled at the Commodore Amiga,
with its 512 k of memory, sitting on the desk in his bedroom.</p>

<p id="id01244" class="calibre1">It was January 1990 and both Phoenix and Electron were at home on
holidays before the start of university.</p>

<p id="id01245" class="calibre1">`Yeah. Wish I could get this thing working. Fucking hell. Work you!'
Phoenix yelled. Electron could hear him typing at the other end of the
phone while he talked. He had been struggling to get AUX, the Apple
version of Unix, running on his Macintosh SE30 for days.</p>

<p id="id01246" class="calibre1">It was difficult to have an uninterrupted conversation with Phoenix.
If it wasn't his machine crashing, it was his grandmother asking him
questions from the doorway of his room.</p>

<p id="id01247" class="calibre1">`You wanna go through the list? How big is your file?' Phoenix asked,
now more focused on the conversation.</p>

<p id="id01248" class="calibre1">`Huh? Which file?'</p>

<p id="id01249" class="calibre1">`The dictionary file. The words to feed into the password cracker,'<br class="calibre4"/>

Phoenix replied.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01250" class="calibre1">Electron pulled up his list of dictionary words and looked
at it. I'm going to have to cut this list down a bit, he thought. The
dictionary was part of the password cracking program.
The larger the dictionary, the longer it took the computer to crack a
list of passwords. If he could weed out obscure words—words that
people were unlikely to pick as passwords—then he could make his
cracker run faster.</p>

<p id="id01251" class="calibre1">An efficient password cracker was a valuable tool. Electron would feed
his home computer a password file from a target computer, say from
Melbourne University, then go to bed. About twelve hours later, he
would check on his machine's progress.</p>

<p id="id01252" class="calibre1">If he was lucky, he would find six or more accounts—user names and
their passwords—waiting for him in a file. The process was completely
automated. Electron could then log into Melbourne University using the
cracked accounts, all of which could be used as jumping-off points for
hacking into other systems for the price of a local telephone call.</p>

<p id="id01253" class="calibre1">Cracking Unix passwords wasn't inordinately difficult,
provided the different components of the program, such as the
dictionary, had been set up properly. However, it was time-consuming.
The principle was simple. Passwords, kept in password files with their
corresponding user names, were encrypted. It was as impossible to
reverse the encryption process as it was to unscramble an omelette.
Instead, you needed to recreate the encryption process and compare the
results.</p>

<p id="id01254" class="calibre1">There were three basic steps. First, target a computer and get a copy
of its password file. Second, take a list of commonly used passwords,
such as users' names from the password file or words from a
dictionary, and encrypt those into a second list. Third, put the two
lists side by side and compare them. When you have a match, you have
found the password.</p>

<p id="id01255" class="calibre1">However, there was one important complication: salts. A salt changed
the way a password was encrypted, subtly modifying the way the DES
encryption algorithm worked. For example, the word `Underground'
encrypts two different ways with two different salts: `kyvbExMcdAOVM'
or `lhFaTmw4Ddrjw'. The first two characters represent the salt, the
others represent the password. The computer chooses a salt randomly
when it encrypts a user's password. Only one is used, and there are
4096 different salts. All Unix computers use salts in their password
encryption process.</p>

<p id="id01256" class="calibre1">Salts were intended to make password cracking far more difficult, so a
hacker couldn't just encrypt a dictionary once and then compare it to
every list of encrypted passwords he came across in his hacking
intrusions. The 4096 salts mean that a hacker would have to use 4096
different dictionaries—each encrypted with a different salt—to
discover any dictionary word passwords.</p>

<p id="id01257" class="calibre1">On any one system penetrated by Electron, there might be only 25
users, and therefore only 25 passwords, most likely using 25 different
salts. Since the salt characters were stored immediately before the
encrypted password, he could easily see which salt was being used for
a particular password. He would therefore only have to encrypt a
dictionary 25 different times.</p>

<p id="id01258" class="calibre1">Still, even encrypting a large dictionary 25 times using different
salts took up too much hard-drive space for a basic home computer. And
that was just the dictionary. The most sophisticated cracking programs
also produced `intelligent guesses' of passwords. For example, the
program might take the user's name and try it in both upper- and
lower-case letters. It might also add a `1' at the end. In short, the
program would create new guesses by permutating, shuffling, reversing
and recombining basic information such as a user's name into new
`words'.</p>

<p id="id01259" class="calibre1">`It's 24000 words. Too damn big,' Electron said. Paring down a
dictionary was a game of trade-offs. The fewer words in a cracking
dictionary, the less time it was likely to take a computer to break
the encrypted passwords. A smaller dictionary, however, also meant
fewer guesses and so a reduced chance of cracking the password of any
given account.</p>

<p id="id01260" class="calibre1">`Hmm. Mine's 24328. We better pare it down together.'</p>

<p id="id01261" class="calibre1">`Yeah. OK. Pick a letter.'</p>

<p id="id01262" class="calibre1">`C. Let's start with the Cs.'</p>

<p id="id01263" class="calibre1">`Why C?'</p>

<p id="id01264" class="calibre1">`C. For my grandmother's cat, Cocoa.'</p>

<p id="id01265" class="calibre1">`Yeah. OK. Here goes. Cab, Cabal. Cabala. Cabbala.' Electron paused.<br class="calibre4"/>

`What the fuck is a Cabbala?'<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01266" class="calibre1">`Dunno. Yeah. I've got those. Not Cabbala. OK, Cabaret. Cabbage. Fuck,<br class="calibre4"/>

I hate cabbage. Who'd pick Cabbage as their password?'<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01267" class="calibre1">`A Pom,' Electron answered.</p>

<p id="id01268" class="calibre1">`Yeah,' Phoenix laughed before continuing.</p>

<p id="id01269" class="calibre1">Phoenix sometimes stopped to think about Force's warning, but usually
he just pushed it to one side when it crept, unwelcomed, into his
thoughts. Still, it worried him. Force took it seriously enough. Not
only had he stopped associating with Electron, he appeared to have
gone very, very quiet.</p>

<p id="id01270" class="calibre1">In fact, Force had found a new love: music. He was writing and
performing his own songs. By early 1990 he seemed so busy with his
music that he had essentially put The Realm on ice. Its members took
to congregating on a machine owned by another Realm member, Nom, for a
month or so.</p>

<p id="id01271" class="calibre1">Somehow, however, Phoenix knew that wasn't all of the story. A hacker
didn't pick up and walk away from hacking just like that. Especially
not Force. Force had been obsessed with hacking. It just didn't make
sense. There had to be something more. Phoenix comforted himself with
the knowledge that he had followed Force's advice and had stayed away
from Electron. Well, for a while anyway.</p>

<p id="id01272" class="calibre1">He had backed right off, watched and waited, but nothing happened.
Electron was as active in the underground as ever but he hadn't been
busted. Nothing had changed. Maybe Force's information had been wrong.
Surely the feds would have busted Electron by now if they were going
to do anything. So Phoenix began to rebuild his relationship with
Electron. It was just too tempting. Phoenix was determined not to let
Force's ego impede his own progress.</p>

<p id="id01273" class="calibre1">By January 1990, Electron was hacking almost all the time. The only
time he wasn't hacking was when he was sleeping, and even then he
often dreamed of hacking. He and Phoenix were sailing past all the
other Melbourne hackers. Electron had grown beyond Powerspike's
expertise just as Phoenix had accelerated past Force. They were moving
away from X.25 networks and into the embryonic Internet, which was
just as illegal since the universities guarded computer
accounts—Internet access—very closely.</p>

<p id="id01274" class="calibre1">Even Nom, with his growing expertise in the Unix operating system
which formed the basis of many new Internet sites, wasn't up to
Electron's standard. He didn't have the same level of commitment to
hacking, the same obsession necessary to be a truly cutting-edge
hacker. In many ways, the relationship between Nom and Phoenix
mirrored the relationship between Electron and Powerspike: the support
act to the main band.</p>

<p id="id01275" class="calibre1">Electron didn't consider Phoenix a close friend, but he was a kindred
spirit. In fact he didn't trust Phoenix, who had a big mouth, a big
ego and a tight friendship with Force—all strikes against him. But
Phoenix was intelligent and he wanted to learn. Most of all, he had
the obsession. Phoenix contributed to a flow of information which
stimulated Electron intellectually, even if more information flowed
toward Phoenix than from him.</p>

<p id="id01276" class="calibre1">Within a month, Phoenix and Electron were in regular contact, and
during the summer holidays they were talking on the phone—voice—all
the time, sometimes three or four times a day. Hack then talk. Compare
notes. Hack some more. Check in again, ask a few questions. Then back
to hacking.</p>

<p id="id01277" class="calibre1">The actual hacking was generally a solo act. For a social animal like
Phoenix, it was a lonely pursuit. While many hackers revelled in the
intense isolation, some, such as Phoenix, also needed to check in with
fellow humanity once in a while. Not just any humanity—those who
understood and shared in the obsession.</p>

<p id="id01278" class="calibre1">`Caboodle. Caboose, `Electron went on, `Cabriolet. What the hell is a<br class="calibre4"/>

Cabriolet? Do you know?'<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01279" class="calibre1">`Yeah,' Phoenix answered, then rushed on. `OK. Cacao. Cache. Cachet
…'</p>

<p id="id01280" class="calibre1">`Tell us. What is it?' Electron cut Phoenix off.</p>

<p id="id01281" class="calibre1">`Cachinnation. Cachou …'</p>

<p id="id01282" class="calibre1">`Do you know?' Electron asked again, slightly irritated. As usual,<br class="calibre4"/>

Phoenix was claiming to know things he probably didn't.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01283" class="calibre1">`Hmm? Uh, yeah,' Phoenix answered weakly. `Cackle. Cacophony …'</p>

<p id="id01284" class="calibre1">Electron knew that particular Phoenix `yeah'—the one which said `yes'
but meant `no, and I don't want to own up to it either so let's drop
it'.</p>

<p id="id01285" class="calibre1">Electron made it a habit not to believe most of the things Phoenix
told him. Unless there was some solid proof, Electron figured it was
just hot air. He didn't actually like Phoenix much as a person, and
found talking to him difficult at times. He preferred the company of
his fellow hacker Powerspike.</p>

<p id="id01286" class="calibre1">Powerspike was both bright and creative. Electron clicked with him.
They often joked about the other's bad taste in music. Powerspike
liked heavy metal, and Electron liked indie music. They shared a
healthy disrespect for authority. Not just the authority of places
they hacked into, like the US Naval Research Laboratories or NASA, but
the authority of The Realm. When it came to politics, they both leaned
to the left. However, their interest tended more toward
anarchy—opposing symbols of the military-industrial complex—than to
joining a political party.</p>

<p id="id01287" class="calibre1">After their expulsion from The Realm, Electron had been a little
isolated for a time. The tragedy of his personal life had contributed
to the isolation. At the age of eight, he had seen his mother die of
lung cancer. He hadn't witnessed the worst parts of her dying over two
years, as she had spent some time in a German cancer clinic hoping for
a reprieve. She had, however, come home to die, and Electron had
watched her fade away.</p>

<p id="id01288" class="calibre1">When the phone call from hospital came one night, Electron could tell
what had happened from the serious tones of the adults. He burst into
tears. He could hear his father answering questions on the phone. Yes,
the boy had taken it hard. No, his sister seemed to be OK. Two years
younger than Electron, she was too young to understand.</p>

<p id="id01289" class="calibre1">Electron had never been particularly close to his sister. He viewed
her as an unfeeling, shallow person—someone who simply skimmed along
the surface of life. But after their mother's death, their father
began to favour Electron's sister, perhaps because of her resemblance
to his late wife. This drove a deeper, more subtle wedge between
brother and sister.</p>

<p id="id01290" class="calibre1">Electron's father, a painter who taught art at a local high school,
was profoundly affected by his wife's death. Despite some barriers of
social class and money, theirs had been a marriage of great affection
and love and they made a happy home. Electron's father's paintings
hung on almost every wall in the house, but after his wife's death he
put down his brushes and never took them up again. He didn't talk
about it. Once, Electron asked him why he didn't paint any more. He
looked away and told Electron that he had `lost the motivation'.</p>

<p id="id01291" class="calibre1">Electron's grandmother moved into the home to help her son care for
his two children, but she developed Alzheimer's disease. The children
ended up caring for her. As a teenager, Electron thought it was
maddening caring for someone who couldn't even remember your name.
Eventually, she moved into a nursing home.</p>

<p id="id01292" class="calibre1">In August 1989, Electron's father arrived home from the doctor's
office. He had been mildly ill for some time, but refused to take time
off work to visit a doctor. He was proud of having taken only one
day's sick leave in the last five years. Finally, in the holidays, he
had seen a doctor who had conducted numerous tests. The results had
come in.</p>

<p id="id01293" class="calibre1">Electron's father had bowel cancer and the disease had spread. It
could not be cured. He had two years to live at the most.</p>

<p id="id01294" class="calibre1">Electron was nineteen years old at the time, and his early love of the
computer, and particularly the modem, had already turned into a
passion. Several years earlier his father, keen to encourage his
fascination with the new machines, used to bring one of the school's
Apple IIes home over weekends and holidays. Electron spent hours at
the borrowed machine. When he wasn't playing on the computer, he read,
plucking one of his father's spy novels from the over-crowded
bookcases, or his own favourite book, The Lord of The Rings.</p>

<p id="id01295" class="calibre1">Computer programming had, however, captured the imagination of the
young Electron years before he used his first computer. At the age of
eleven he was using books to write simple programs on paper—mostly
games—despite the fact that he had never actually touched a keyboard.</p>

<p id="id01296" class="calibre1">His school may have had a few computers, but its administrators had
little understanding of what to do with them. In year 9, Electron had
met with the school's career counsellor, hoping to learn about career
options working with computers.</p>

<p id="id01297" class="calibre1">`I think maybe I'd like to do a course in computer programming …'<br class="calibre4"/>

His voice trailed off, hesitantly.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01298" class="calibre1">`Why would you want to do that?' she said. `Can't you think of
anything better than that?'</p>

<p id="id01299" class="calibre1">`Uhm …' Electron was at a loss. He didn't know what to do. That was
why he had come to her. He cast around for something which seemed a
more mainstream career option but which might also let him work on
computers. `Well, accounting maybe?'</p>

<p id="id01300" class="calibre1">`Oh yes, that's much better,' she said.</p>

<p id="id01301" class="calibre1">`You can probably even get into a university, and study accounting
there. I'm sure you will enjoy it,' she added, smiling as she closed
his file.</p>

<p id="id01302" class="calibre1">The borrowed computers were, in Electron's opinion, one of the few
good things about school. He did reasonably well at school, but only
because it didn't take much effort. Teachers consistently told his
father that Electron was underachieving and that he distracted the
other students in class. For the most part, the criticism was just
low-level noise. Occasionally, however, Electron had more serious
run-ins with his teachers. Some thought he was gifted. Others thought
the freckle-faced, Irish-looking boy who helped his friends set fire
to textbooks at the back of the class was nothing but a smart alec.</p>

<p id="id01303" class="calibre1">When he was sixteen, Electron bought his own computer. He used it to
crack software protection, just as Par had done. The Apple was soon
replaced by a more powerful Amiga with a 20 megabyte IBM compatible
sidecar. The computers lived, in succession, on one of the two desks
in his bedroom. The second desk, for his school work, was usually
piled high with untouched assignments.</p>

<p id="id01304" class="calibre1">The most striking aspect of Electron's room was the ream after ream of
dot matrix computer print-out which littered the floor. Standing at
almost any point in the simply furnished room, someone could reach out
and grab at least one pile of print-outs, most of which contained
either usernames and passwords or printed computer program code. In
between the piles of print-outs, were T-shirts, jeans, sneakers and
books on the floor. It was impossible to walk across Electron's room
without stepping on something.</p>

<p id="id01305" class="calibre1">The turning point for Electron was the purchase of a second-hand 300
baud modem in 1986. Overnight, the modem transformed Electron's love
of the computer into an obsession. During the semester immediately
before the modem's arrival, Electron's report card showed six As and
one B. The following semester he earned six Bs and only one A.</p>

<p id="id01306" class="calibre1">Electron had moved onto bigger and better things than school. He
quickly became a regular user of underground BBSes and began hacking.
He was enthralled by an article he discovered describing how several
hackers claimed to have moved a satellite around in space simply by
hacking computers. From that moment on, Electron decided he wanted to
hack—to find out if the article was true.</p>

<p id="id01307" class="calibre1">Before he graduated from school in 1987, Electron had hacked NASA, an
achievement which saw him dancing around the dining room table in the
middle of the night chanting, `I got into NASA! I got into NASA!' He
hadn't moved any satellites, but getting into the space agency was as
thrilling as flying to the moon.</p>

<p id="id01308" class="calibre1">By 1989, he had been hacking regularly for years, much to the chagrin
of his sister, who claimed her social life suffered because the
family's sole phone line was always tied up by the modem.</p>

<p id="id01309" class="calibre1">For Phoenix, Electron was a partner in hacking, and to a lesser degree
a mentor. Electron had a lot to offer, by that time even more than The
Realm.</p>

<p id="id01310" class="calibre1">`Cactus, Cad, Cadaver, Caddis, Cadence, Cadet, Caesura. What the fuck
is a Caesura?' Phoenix kept ploughing through the Cs.</p>

<p id="id01311" class="calibre1">`Dunno. Kill that,' Electron answered, distracted.</p>

<p id="id01312" class="calibre1">`Caesura. Well, fuck. I know I'd wanna use that as a password.'<br class="calibre4"/>

Phoenix laughed. `What the hell kind of word is Caduceus?'<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01313" class="calibre1">`A dead one. Kill all those. Who makes up these dictionaries?'<br class="calibre4"/>

Electron said.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01314" class="calibre1">`Yeah.'</p>

<p id="id01315" class="calibre1">`Caisson, Calabash. Kill those. Kill, kill, kill,' Electron said
gleefully.</p>

<p id="id01316" class="calibre1">`Hang on. How come I don't have Calabash in my list?' Phoenix feigned
indignation.</p>

<p id="id01317" class="calibre1">Electron laughed.</p>

<p id="id01318" class="calibre1">`Hey,' Phoenix said, `we should put in words like "Qwerty" and<br class="calibre4"/>

"ABCDEF" and "ASDFGH".'<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01319" class="calibre1">`Did that already.' Electron had already put together a list of other
common passwords, such as the `words' made when a user typed the six
letters in the first alphabet row on a keyboard.</p>

<p id="id01320" class="calibre1">Phoenix started on the list again. `OK the COs. Commend, Comment,
Commerce, Commercial, Commercialism, Commercially. Kill those last
three.'</p>

<p id="id01321" class="calibre1">`Huh? Why kill Commercial?'</p>

<p id="id01322" class="calibre1">`Let's just kill all the words with more than eight characters,'<br class="calibre4"/>

Phoenix said.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01323" class="calibre1">`No. That's not a good idea.'</p>

<p id="id01324" class="calibre1">`How come? The computer's only going to read the first eight
characters and encrypt those. So we should kill all the rest.'</p>

<p id="id01325" class="calibre1">Sometimes Phoenix just didn't get it. But Electron didn't rub it in.
He kept it low-key, so as not to bruise Phoenix's ego. Often Electron
sensed Phoenix sought approval from the older hacker, but it was a
subtle, perhaps even unconscious search.</p>

<p id="id01326" class="calibre1">`Nah,' Electron began, `See, someone might use the whole word,
Commerce or Commercial. The first eight letters of these words are not
the same. The eighth character in Commerce is "e", but in Commercial
it's "i".'</p>

<p id="id01327" class="calibre1">There was a short silence.</p>

<p id="id01328" class="calibre1">`Yeah,' Electron went on, `but you could kill all the words
like Commercially, and Commercialism, that come after Commercial.
See?'</p>

<p id="id01329" class="calibre1">`Yeah. OK. I see,' Phoenix said.</p>

<p id="id01330" class="calibre1">`But don't just kill every word longer than eight characters,'<br class="calibre4"/>

Electron added.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01331" class="calibre1">`Hmm. OK. Yeah, all right.' Phoenix seemed a bit out of sorts. `Hey,'
he brightened a bit, `it's been a whole ten minutes since my machine
crashed.'</p>

<p id="id01332" class="calibre1">`Yeah?' Electron tried to sound interested.</p>

<p id="id01333" class="calibre1">`Yeah. You know,' Phoenix changed the subject to his favourite topic,
`what we really need is Deszip. Gotta get that.' Deszip was a computer
program which could be used for password cracking.</p>

<p id="id01334" class="calibre1">`And Zardoz. We need Zardoz,' Electron added. Zardoz was a restricted
electronic publication detailing computer security holes.</p>

<p id="id01335" class="calibre1">`Yeah. Gotta try to get into Spaf's machine. Spaf'll have it for
sure.' Eugene Spafford, Associate Professor of Computer Science at
Purdue University in the US, was one of the best known computer
security experts on the Internet in 1990.</p>

<p id="id01336" class="calibre1">`Yeah.'</p>

<p id="id01337" class="calibre1">And so began their hunt for the holy grail.</p>

<p id="id01338" class="calibre2">Deszip and Zardoz glittered side by side as the most coveted prizes in
the world of the international Unix hacker.</p>

<p id="id01339" class="calibre1">Cracking passwords took time and computer resources. Even a moderately
powerful university machine would grunt and groan under the weight of
the calculations if it was asked to do. But the Deszip program could
change that, lifting the load until it was, by comparison,
feather-light. It worked at breathtaking speed and a hacker using
Deszip could crack encrypted passwords up to 25 times faster.</p>

<p id="id01340" class="calibre1">Zardoz, a worldwide security mailing list, was also precious, but for
a different reason. Although the mailing list's formal name was
Security Digest, everyone in the underground simply called it Zardoz,
after the computer from which the mailouts originated. Zardoz also
happened to be the name of a science fiction cult film starring Sean
Connery. Run by Neil Gorsuch, the Zardoz mailing list contained
articles, or postings, from various members of the computer security
industry. The postings discussed newly discovered bugs—problems with
a computer system which could be exploited to break into or gain root
access on a machine. The beauty of the bugs outlined in Zardoz was
that they worked on any computer system using the programs or
operating systems it described. Any university, any military system,
any research institute which ran the software documented in Zardoz was
vulnerable. Zardoz was a giant key ring, full of pass keys made to fit
virtually every lock.</p>

<p id="id01341" class="calibre1">True, system administrators who read a particular Zardoz posting might
take steps to close up that security hole. But as the hacking
community knew well, it was a long time between a Zardoz posting and a
shortage of systems with that hole. Often a bug worked on many
computers for months—sometimes years—after being announced on
Zardoz.</p>

<p id="id01342" class="calibre1">Why? Many admins had never heard of the bug when it was first
announced. Zardoz was an exclusive club, and most admins simply
weren't members. You couldn't just walk in off the street and sign up
for Zardoz. You had to be vetted by peers in the computer security
industry. You had to administer a legitimate computer system,
preferably with a large institution such as a university or a research
body such as CSIRO. Figuratively speaking, the established members of
the Zardoz mailing list peered down their noses at you and determined
if you were worthy of inclusion in Club Zardoz. Only they decided if
you were trustworthy enough to share in the great security secrets of
the world's computer systems.</p>

<p id="id01343" class="calibre1">In 1989, the white hats, as hackers called the professional security
gurus, were highly paranoid about Zardoz getting into the wrong hands.
So much so, in fact, that many postings to Zardoz were fine examples
of the art of obliqueness. A computer security expert would hint at a
new bug in his posting without actually coming out and explaining it
in what is commonly referred to as a `cookbook' explanation.</p>

<p id="id01344" class="calibre1">This led to a raging debate within the comp-sec industry. In one
corner, the cookbook purists said that bulletins such as Zardoz were
only going to be helpful if people were frank with each other. They
wanted people posting to Zardoz to provide detailed, step-by-step
explanations on how to exploit a particular security hole. Hackers
would always find out about bugs one way or another and the best way
to keep them out of your system was to secure it properly in the first
place. They wanted full disclosure.</p>

<p id="id01345" class="calibre1">In the other corner, the hard-line, command-and-control computer
security types argued that posting an announcement to Zardoz posed the
gravest of security risks. What if Zardoz fell into the wrong hands?
Why, any sixteen-year-old hacker would have step-by-step directions
showing how to break into thousands of individual computers! If you
had to reveal a security flaw—and the jury was still out in their
minds as to whether that was such a good idea—it should be done only
in the most oblique terms.</p>

<p id="id01346" class="calibre1">What the hard-liners failed to understand was that world-class hackers
like Electron could read the most oblique, carefully crafted Zardoz
postings and, within a matter of days if not hours, work out exactly
how to exploit the security hole hinted at in the text. After which
they could just as easily have written a cookbook version of the
security bug.</p>

<p id="id01347" class="calibre1">Most good hackers had come across one or two issues of Zardoz in their
travels, often while rummaging though the system administrator's mail
on a prestigious institution's computer. But no-one from the elite of
the Altos underground had a full archive of all the back issues. The
hacker who possessed that would have details of every major security
hole discovered by the world's best computer security minds since at
least 1988.</p>

<p id="id01348" class="calibre1">Like Zardoz, Deszip was well guarded. It was written by computer
security expert Dr Matthew Bishop, who worked at NASA's Research
Institute for Advanced Computer Science before taking up a teaching
position at Dartmouth, an Ivy League college in New Hampshire. The
United States government deemed Deszip's very fast encryption
algorithms to be so important, they were classified as armaments. It
was illegal to export them from the US.</p>

<p id="id01349" class="calibre1">Of course, few hackers in 1990 had the sophistication to use weapons
such as Zardoz and Deszip properly. Indeed, few even knew they
existed. But Electron and Phoenix knew, along with a tiny handful of
others, including Pad and Gandalf from Britain. Congregating on Altos
in Germany, they worked with a select group of others carefully
targeting sites likely to contain parts of their holy grail. They were
methodical and highly strategic, piecing information together with
exquisite, almost forensic, skill. While the common rabble of other
hackers were thumping their heads against walls in brute-force attacks
on random machines, these hackers spent their time hunting for
strategic pressure points—the Achilles' heels of the computer
security community.</p>

<p id="id01350" class="calibre1">They had developed an informal hit list of machines, most of which
belonged to high-level computer security gurus. Finding one or two
early issues of Zardoz, Electron had combed through their postings
looking not just on the surface—for the security bugs—but also
paying careful attention to the names and addresses of the people
writing articles. Authors who appeared frequently in Zardoz, or had
something intelligent to say, went on the hit list. It was those
people who were most likely to keep copies of Deszip or an archive of
Zardoz on their machines.</p>

<p id="id01351" class="calibre1">Electron had searched across the world for information about Deszip
and DES (Data Encryption Standard), the original encryption program
later used in Deszip. He hunted through computers at the University of
New York, the US Naval Research Laboratories in Washington DC,
Helsinki University of Technology, Rutgers University in New Jersey,
Melbourne University and Tampere University in Finland, but the search
bore little fruit. He found a copy of CDES, a public domain encryption
program which used the DES algorithm, but not Deszip. CDES could be
used to encrypt files but not to crack passwords.</p>

<p id="id01352" class="calibre1">The two Australian hackers had, however, enjoyed a small taste of
Deszip. In 1989 they had broken into a computer at Dartmouth College
called Bear. They discovered Deszip carefully tucked away in a corner
of Bear and had spirited a copy of the program away to a safer machine
at another institution.</p>

<p id="id01353" class="calibre1">It turned out to be a hollow victory. That copy of Deszip had been
encrypted with Crypt, a program based on the German Enigma machine
used in World War II. Without the passphrase—the key to unlock the
encryption—it was impossible to read Deszip. All they could do was
stare, frustrated, at the file name Deszip labelling a treasure just
out of reach.</p>

<p id="id01354" class="calibre1">Undaunted, the hackers decided to keep the encrypted file just in case
they ever came across the passphrase somewhere—in an email letter,
for example—in one of the dozens of new computers they now hacked
regularly. Relabelling the encrypted Deszip file with a more innocuous
name, they stored the copy in a dark corner of another machine.
Thinking it wise to buy a little insurance as well, they gave a second
copy of the encrypted Deszip to Gandalf, who stored it on a machine in
the UK in case the Australians' copy disappeared unexpectedly.</p>

<p id="id01355" class="calibre2">In January 1990, Electron turned his attention to getting Zardoz.
After carefully reviewing an old copy of Zardoz, he had discovered a
system admin in Melbourne on the list. The subscriber could well have
the entire Zardoz archive on his machine, and that machine was so
close—less than half an hour's drive from Electron's home. All
Electron had to do was to break into the CSIRO.</p>

<p id="id01356" class="calibre1">The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, or
CSIRO, is a government owned and operated research body with many
offices around Australia. Electron only wanted to get into one: the
Division of Information Technology at 55 Barry Street, Carlton, just
around the corner from the University of Melbourne.</p>

<p id="id01357" class="calibre1">Rummaging through a Melbourne University computer, Electron had
already found one copy of the Zardoz archive, belonging to a system
admin. He gathered it up and quietly began downloading it to his
computer, but as his machine slowly siphoned off the Zardoz copy, his
link to the university abruptly went dead. The admin had discovered
the hacker and quickly killed the connection. All of which left
Electron back at square one—until he found another copy of Zardoz on
the CSIRO machine.</p>

<p id="id01358" class="calibre1">It was nearly 3 a.m. on 1 February 1990, but Electron wasn't tired.
His head was buzzing. He had just successfully penetrated an account
called Worsley on the CSIRO computer called
DITMELA, using the sendmail bug. Electron assumed
DITMELA stood for Division of Information Technology, Melbourne,
computer `A'.</p>

<p id="id01359" class="calibre1">Electron began sifting through Andrew Worsley's directories that day.
He knew Zardoz was in there somewhere, since he had seen it before.
After probing the computer, experimenting with different security
holes hoping one would let him inside, Electron managed to slip in
unnoticed. It was mid-afternoon, a bad time to hack a computer since
someone at work would likely spot the intruder before long. So
Electron told himself this was just a reconnaissance mission. Find out
if Zardoz was on the machine, then get out of there fast and come back
later—preferably in the middle of the night—to pull Zardoz out.</p>

<p id="id01360" class="calibre1">When he found a complete collection of Zardoz in Worsley's directory,
Electron was tempted to try a grab and run. The problem was that, with
his slow modem, he couldn't run very quickly. Downloading Zardoz would
take several hours. Quashing his overwhelming desire to reach out and
grab Zardoz then and there, he slipped out of the machine noiselessly.</p>

<p id="id01361" class="calibre1">Early next morning, an excited and impatient Electron crept back into
DITMELA and headed straight for Worsley's directory. Zardoz was still
there. And a sweet irony. Electron was using a security bug he had
found on an early issue of Zardoz to break into the computer which
would surrender the entire archive to him.</p>

<p id="id01362" class="calibre1">Getting Zardoz out of the CSIRO machine was going to be a little
difficult. It was a big archive and at 300 baud—30 characters per
second—Electron's modem would take five hours to siphon off an entire
copy. Using the CAT command, Electron made copies of all the Zardoz
issues and bundled them up into one 500 k file. He called the new file
.t and stored it in the temporary directory on DITMELA.</p>

<p id="id01363" class="calibre1">Then he considered what to do next. He would mail the Zardoz bundle to
another account outside the CSIRO computer, for safe-keeping. But
after that he had to make a choice: try to download the thing himself
or hang up, call Phoenix and ask him to download it.</p>

<p id="id01364" class="calibre1">Using his 2400 baud modem, Phoenix would be able to download the
Zardoz bundle eight times faster than Electron could. On the other
hand, Electron didn't particularly want to give Phoenix access to the
CSIRO machine. They had both been targeting the machine, but he hadn't
told Phoenix that he had actually managed to get in. It wasn't that he
planned on withholding Zardoz when he got it. Quite the contrary,
Electron wanted Phoenix to read the security file so they could bounce
ideas off each other. When it came to accounts, however, Phoenix had a
way of messing things up. He talked too much. He was simply not
discreet.</p>

<p id="id01365" class="calibre1">While Electron considered his decision, his fingers kept working at
the keyboard. He typed quickly, mailing copies of the Zardoz bundle to
two hacked student accounts at Melbourne University. With the
passwords to both accounts, he could get in whenever he wanted and he
wasn't taking any chances with this precious cargo. Two accounts were
safer than one—a main account and a back-up in case someone changed
the password on the first one.</p>

<p id="id01366" class="calibre1">Then, as the DITMELA machine was still in the process of mailing the
Zardoz bundle off to the back-up sites, Electron's connection suddenly
died.</p>

<p id="id01367" class="calibre1">The CSIRO machine had hung up on him, which probably meant one thing.
The admin had logged him off. Electron was furious. What the hell was
a system administrator doing on a computer at this hour? The admin was
supposed to be asleep! That's why Electron logged on when he did. He
had seen Zardoz on the CSIRO machine the day before but he had been so
patient refusing to touch it because the risk of discovery was too
great. And now this.</p>

<p id="id01368" class="calibre1">The only hope was to call Phoenix and get him to login to the
Melbourne Uni accounts to see if the mail had arrived safely. If so,
he could download it with his faster modem before the CSIRO admin had
time to warn the Melbourne Uni admin, who would change the passwords.</p>

<p id="id01369" class="calibre1">Electron got on the phone to Phoenix. They had long since stopped
caring about what time of day they rang each other. 10 p.m. 2 a.m.
4.15 a.m. 6.45 a.m.</p>

<p id="id01370" class="calibre1">`Yeah.' Electron greeted Phoenix in the usual way.</p>

<p id="id01371" class="calibre1">`Yup,' Phoenix responded.</p>

<p id="id01372" class="calibre1">Electron told Phoenix what happened and gave him the two accounts at<br class="calibre4"/>

Melbourne University where he had mailed the Zardoz bundle.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01373" class="calibre1">Phoenix hung up and rang back a few minutes later. Both accounts were
dead. Someone from Melbourne University had gone in and changed the
passwords within 30 minutes of Electron being booted off the CSIRO
computer. Both hackers were disturbed by the implications of this
event. It meant someone—in fact probably several people—were onto
them. But their desperation to get Zardoz overcame their fear.</p>

<p id="id01374" class="calibre1">Electron had one more account on the CSIRO computer. He didn't want to
give it to Phoenix, but he didn't have a choice. Still, the whole
venture was filled with uncertainty. Who knew if the Zardoz bundle was
still there? Surely an admin who bothered to kick Electron out would
move Zardoz to somewhere inaccessible. There was, however, a single
chance.</p>

<p id="id01375" class="calibre1">When Electron read off the password and username, he told Phoenix to
copy the Zardoz bundle to a few other machines on the Internet instead
of trying to download it to his own computer. It would be much
quicker, and the CSIRO admin wouldn't dare break into someone else's
computers to delete the copied file. Choosing overseas sites would
make it even harder for the admin to reach the admins of those
machines and warn them in time. Then, once Zardoz was safely tucked
away in a few back-up sites, Phoenix could download it over the
Internet from one of those with less risk of being booted off the
machine halfway through the process.</p>

<p id="id01376" class="calibre1">Sitting at his home in Kelvin Grove, Thornbury, just two suburbs north
of the CSIRO machine, Ian Mathieson watched the hacker break into his
computer again. Awoken by a phone call at 2.30 a.m. telling him there
was a suspected hacker in his computer, Mathieson immediately logged
in to his work system, DITMELA, via his home computer and modem. The
call, from David Hornsby of the Melbourne University Computer Science
Department, was no false alarm.</p>

<p id="id01377" class="calibre1">After watching the unknown hacker, who had logged in through a
Melbourne University machine terminal server, for about twenty
minutes, Mathieson booted the hacker off his system. Afterwards he
noticed that the DITMELA computer was still trying to execute a
command issued by the hacker. He looked a little closer, and
discovered DITMELA was trying to deliver mail to two Melbourne
University accounts.</p>

<p id="id01378" class="calibre1">The mail, however, hadn't been completely delivered. It was still
sitting in the mail spool, a temporary holding pen for undelivered
mail. Curious as to what the hacker would want so much from his
system, Mathieson moved the file into a subdirectory to look at it. He
was horrified to find the entire Zardoz archive, and he knew exactly
what it meant. These were no ordinary hackers—they were precision
fliers. Fortunately, Mathieson
consoled himself, he had stopped the mail before it had been sent out
and secured it.</p>

<p id="id01379" class="calibre1">Unfortunately, however, Mathieson had missed Electron's original
file—the bundle of Zardoz copies. When Electron had mailed the file,
he had copied it, leaving the original intact. They were still sitting
on DITMELA under the unassuming name .t. Mailing a file didn't delete
it—the computer only sent a copy of the original. Mathieson was an
intelligent man, a medical doctor with a master's degree in computer
science, but he had forgotten to check the temporary directory, one of
the few places a hacker could store files on a Unix system if he
didn't have root privileges.</p>

<p id="id01380" class="calibre1">At exactly 3.30 a.m. Phoenix logged into DITMELA from the University
of Texas. He quickly looked in the temporary directory. The .t file
was there, just as Electron had said it would be. The hacker quickly
began transferring it back to the University of Texas.</p>

<p id="id01381" class="calibre1">He was feeling good. It looked like the Australians were going to get
the entire Zardoz collection after all. Everything was going extremely
well—until the transfer suddenly died. Phoenix had forgotten to check
that there was enough disk space available on the University of Texas
account to download the sizeable Zardoz bundle. Now, as he was logged
into a very hot machine, a machine where the admin could well be
watching his every move, he discovered there wasn't enough room for
the Zardoz file.</p>

<p id="id01382" class="calibre1">Aware that every second spent on-line to DITMELA posed a serious risk,
Phoenix logged off the CSIRO machine immediately. Still connected to
the Texas computer, he fiddled around with it, deleting other files
and making enough room to pull the whole 500 k Zardoz file across.</p>

<p id="id01383" class="calibre1">At 3.37 a.m. Phoenix entered DITMELA again. This time, he vowed,
nothing would go wrong. He started up the file transfer and waited.
Less than ten minutes later, he logged off the CSIRO computer and
nervously checked the University of Texas system. It was there.
Zardoz, in all its glory. And it was his! Phoenix was ecstatic.</p>

<p id="id01384" class="calibre1">He wasn't done yet and there was no time for complacency. Swiftly, he
began compressing and encrypting Zardoz. He
compressed it because a smaller file was less obvious on the Texas
machine and was faster to send to a back-up machine. He encrypted it
so no-one nosing around the file would be able to see what was in it.
He wasn't just worried about system admins; the Texas system was
riddled with hackers, in part because it was home to his friend,
Legion of Doom hacker Erik Bloodaxe, a
student at the university.</p>

<p id="id01385" class="calibre1">After Phoenix was satisfied Zardoz was safe, he rang Electron just<br class="calibre4"/>

before 4 a.m. with the good news. By 8.15, Phoenix had downloaded<br class="calibre4"/>

Zardoz from the Texas computer onto his own machine. By 1.15 p.m.,<br class="calibre4"/>

Electron had downloaded it from Phoenix's machine to his own.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01386" class="calibre2">Zardoz had been a difficult conquest, but Deszip would prove to be
even more so. While dozens of security experts possessed complete
Zardoz archives, far fewer people had Deszip. And, at least
officially, all of them were in the US.</p>

<p id="id01387" class="calibre1">The US government banned the export of cryptography algorithms. To
send a copy of Deszip, or DES or indeed any other encryption program
outside the US was a crime. It was illegal because the US State
Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls considered any
encryption program to be a weapon. ITAR, the International Traffic in
Arms Regulations stemming from the US Arms Export Control Act 1977,
restricted publication of and trad in `defense articles'. It didn't
matter whether you flew to Europe with a disk in your pocket, or you
sent the material over the Internet. If you violated ITAR, you faced
the prospect of prison.</p>

<p id="id01388" class="calibre1">Occasionally, American computer programmers discreetly slipped copies
of encryption programs to specialists in their field outside the US.
Once the program was outside the US, it was fair game—there was
nothing US authorities could do about someone in Norway sending Deszip
to a colleague in Australia. But even so, the comp-sec and
cryptography communities outside the US still held programs such as
Deszip very tightly within their own inner sanctums.</p>

<p id="id01389" class="calibre1">All of which meant that Electron and Phoenix would almost certainly
have to target a site in the US. Electron continued to compile a hit
list, based on the Zardoz mailing list, which he gave to Phoenix. The
two hackers then began searching the growing Internet for computers
belonging to the targets.</p>

<p id="id01390" class="calibre1">It was an impressive hit list. Matthew Bishop, author of Deszip.
Russell Brand, of the Lawrence Livermore National Labs, a research
laboratory funded by the US Department of Energy. Dan Farmer, an
author of the computer program COPS, a popular security-testing
program which included a password cracking program. There were others.
And, at the top of the list, Eugene Spafford, or Spaf, as the hackers
called him.</p>

<p id="id01391" class="calibre1">By 1990, the computer underground viewed Spaf not just as security
guru, but also as an anti-hacker zealot. Spaf was based at Purdue
University, a hotbed of computer security experts. Bishop had earned
his PhD at Purdue and Dan Farmer was still there. Spaf was also one of
the founders of usenet, the Internet newsgroups service. While working
as a computer scientist at the university, he had made a name for
himself by, among other things, writing a technical analysis of the
RTM worm. The worm, authored by Cornell University student Robert T.
Morris Jr in 1988, proved to be a boon for Spaf's career.</p>

<p id="id01392" class="calibre1">Prior to the RTM worm, Spaf had been working in software engineering.
After the worm, he became a computer ethicist and a very public
spokesman for the conservatives in the computer security industry.
Spaf went on tour across the US, lecturing the public and the media on
worms, viruses and the ethics of hacking. During the Morris case,
hacking became a hot topic in the United States, and Spaf fed the
flames. When Judge Howard G. Munson refused to sentence Morris to
prison, instead ordering him to complete 400 hours community service,
pay a $10000 fine and submit to three years probation, Spaf publicly
railed against the decision. The media reported that he had called on
the computer industry to boycott any company which chose to employ
Robert T. Morris Jr.</p>

<p id="id01393" class="calibre1">Targeting Spaf therefore served a dual purpose for the Australian
hackers. He was undoubtedly a repository of treasures such as Deszip,
and he was also a tall poppy.</p>

<p id="id01394" class="calibre1">One night, Electron and Phoenix decided to break into Spaf's machine
at Purdue to steal a copy of Deszip. Phoenix would do the actual
hacking, since he had the fast modem, but he would talk to Electron
simultaneously on the other phone line. Electron would guide him at
each step. That way, when Phoenix hit a snag, he wouldn't have to
retreat to regroup and risk discovery.</p>

<p id="id01395" class="calibre1">Both hackers had managed to break into another computer at Purdue,
called Medusa. But Spaf had a separate machine, Uther, which was
connected to Medusa.</p>

<p id="id01396" class="calibre1">Phoenix poked and prodded at Uther, trying to open a hole wide enough
for him to crawl through. At Electron's suggestion, he tried to use
the CHFN bug. The CHFN command lets users change the information
provided—such as their name, work address or office phone
number—when someone `fingers' their accounts. The bug had appeared in
one of the Zardoz files and Phoenix and Electron had already used it
to break into several other machines.</p>

<p id="id01397" class="calibre1">Electron wanted to use the CHFN bug because, if the attack was
successful, Phoenix would be able to make a root account for himself
on Spaf's machine. That would be the ultimate slap in the face to a
high-profile computer security guru.</p>

<p id="id01398" class="calibre1">But things weren't going well for Phoenix. The frustrated Australian
hacker kept telling Electron that the bug should work, but it
wouldn't, and he couldn't figure out why. The problem, Electron
finally concluded, was that Spaf's machine was a Sequent. The CHFN bug
depended on a particular Unix password file structure, but Sequents
used a different structure. It didn't help that Phoenix didn't know
that much about Sequents—they were one of Gandalf's specialties.</p>

<p id="id01399" class="calibre1">After a few exasperating hours struggling to make the CHFN bug work,
Phoenix gave up and turned to another security flaw suggested by
Electron: the FTP bug. Phoenix ran through the bug in his mind.
Normally, someone used FTP, or file transfer protocol, to transfer
files over a network, such as the Internet, from one computer to
another. FTPing to another machine was a bit like telnetting, but the
user didn't need a password to login and the commands he could execute
once in the other computer were usually very limited.</p>

<p id="id01400" class="calibre1">If it worked, the FTP bug would allow Phoenix to slip in an extra
command during the FTP login process. That command would force Spaf's
machine to allow Phoenix to login as anyone he wanted—and what he
wanted was to login as someone who had root privileges. The `root'
account might be a little obvious
if anyone was watching, and it didn't always have remote
access anyway. So he chose `daemon', another commonly root-privileged
account, instead.</p>

<p id="id01401" class="calibre1">It was a shot in the dark. Phoenix was fairly sure Spaf would have
secured his machine against such an obvious attack, but Electron urged
him to give it a try anyway. The FTP bug had been announced throughout
the computer security community long ago, appearing in an early issue
of Zardoz. Phoenix hesitated, but he had run out of ideas, and time.</p>

<p id="id01402" class="calibre1">Phoenix typed:</p>

<p id="id01403" class="calibre1">FTP -i uther.purdue.edu</p>

<p id="id01404" class="calibre1">quote user anonymous</p>

<p id="id01405" class="calibre1">quote cd ~daemon</p>

<p id="id01406" class="calibre1">quote pass anything</p>

<p id="id01407" class="calibre1">The few seconds it took for his commands to course from his suburban
home in Melbourne and race deep into the Midwest felt like a lifetime.
He wanted Spaf's machine, wanted Deszip, and wanted this attack to
work. If he could just get Deszip, he felt the Australians would be
unstoppable.</p>

<p id="id01408" class="calibre1">Spaf's machine opened its door as politely as a doorman at the Ritz<br class="calibre4"/>

Carlton. Phoenix smiled at his computer. He was in.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id01409" class="calibre1">It was like being in Aladdin's cave. Phoenix just sat there, stunned
at the bounty which lay before him. It was his, all his. Spaf had
megabytes of security files in his directories. Source code for the
RTM Internet worm. Source code for the WANK worm. Everything. Phoenix
wanted to plunge his hands in each treasure chest and scoop out greedy
handfuls, but he resisted the urge. He had a more important—a more
strategic—mission to accomplish first.</p>

<p id="id01410" class="calibre1">He prowled through the directories, hunting everywhere for Deszip.
Like a burglar scouring the house for the family silver, he pawed
through directory after directory. Surely, Spaf had to have Deszip. If
anyone besides Matthew Bishop was going to have a copy, he would. And
finally, there it was. Deszip. Just waiting for Phoenix.</p>

<p id="id01411" class="calibre1">Then Phoenix noticed something else. Another file. Curiosity got the
better of him and he zoomed in to have a quick look. This one
contained a passphrase—the passphrase. The phrase the Australians
needed to decrypt the original copy of Deszip they had stolen from the
Bear computer at Dartmouth three months earlier. Phoenix couldn't
believe the passphrase. It was so simple, so obvious. But he caught
himself. This was no time to cry over spilled milk. He had to get
Deszip out of the machine quickly, before anyone noticed he was there.</p>

<p id="id01412" class="calibre1">But as Phoenix began typing in commands, his screen appeared to freeze
up. He checked. It wasn't his computer. Something was wrong at the
other end. He was still logged into Spaf's machine. The connection
hadn't been killed. But when he typed commands, the computer in West
Lafayette, Indiana, didn't respond. Spaf's machine just sat there,
deaf and dumb.</p>

<p id="id01413" class="calibre1">Phoenix stared at his computer, trying to figure out what was
happening. Why wouldn't Spaf's machine answer? There were two
possibilities. Either the network—the connection between the first
machine he penetrated at Purdue and Spaf's own machine—had gone down
accidentally. Or someone had pulled the plug.</p>

<p id="id01414" class="calibre1">Why pull the plug? If they knew he was in there, why not just kick him
out of the machine? Better still, why not kick him out of Purdue all
together? Maybe they wanted to keep him on-line to trace which machine
he was coming from, eventually winding backwards from system to
system, following his trail.</p>
