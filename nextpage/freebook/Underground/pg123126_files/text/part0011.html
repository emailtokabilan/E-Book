    As he didn't have the program he needed to interpret the mush, Anthrax
cast around looking for a more readable directory.</p>

<p id="id02728" class="calibre1">He pried open a file and discovered it was a list. Names and phone
numbers of staff at a large telecommunications company. Work phone
numbers. Home numbers. Well, at least that gave him a clue as to the
nature of the project. Something to do with telecommunications. A
project important enough that the military needed the home phone
numbers of the senior people involved.</p>

<p id="id02729" class="calibre1">The next file confirmed it. Another list, a very special list. A pot
of gold at the end of the rainbow. The find of a career spent hacking.</p>

<p id="id02730" class="calibre1">If the US government had had any inkling what was happening at that
moment, heads would have rolled. If it had known that a foreigner, and
a follower of what mainstream American media termed an extremist
religious group, had this information in his possession, the defence
agency would have called in every law enforcement agency it could
enlist.</p>

<p id="id02731" class="calibre1">As John McMahon might have said, a lot of yelling and screaming would
have occurred.</p>

<p id="id02732" class="calibre1">Anthrax's mother had made a good home for the family, but his father
continued to disrupt it with his violence. Fun times with his friends
shone like bright spots amidst the decay of Anthrax's family life.
Practical jokes were his specialty. Even as a small child, he had
delighted in trickery and as he grew up, the jokes became more
sophisticated. Phreaking was great. It let him prank people all over
the world. And pranking was cool.</p>

<p id="id02733" class="calibre1">Most of the fun in pranking was sharing it with friends. Anthrax
called into a voice conference frequented by phreakers and hackers.
Though he never trusted others completely when it came to working on
projects together, it was OK to socialise. The phreaking methods he
used to get onto the phone conference were his own business. Provided
he was discreet in how much he said in the conference, he thought
there wasn't too much risk.</p>

<p id="id02734" class="calibre1">He joined the conference calls using a variety of methods. One
favourite was using a multinational corporation's Dialcom service.
Company employees called in, gave their ID numbers, and the operator
put them through to wherever they wanted to go, free of charge. All
Anthrax needed was a valid ID number.</p>

<p id="id02735" class="calibre1">Sometimes it was hard work, sometimes he was lucky. The day Anthrax
tried the Dialcom service was a lucky day. He dialled from his
favourite pay phone.</p>

<p id="id02736" class="calibre1">`What is your code, sir?' The operator asked.</p>

<p id="id02737" class="calibre1">`Yes, well, this is Mr Baker. I have a sheet with a lot of numbers
here. I am new to the company. Not sure which one it is.' Anthrax
shuffled papers on top of the pay phone, near the receiver. `How many
digits is it?'</p>

<p id="id02738" class="calibre1">`Seven.'</p>

<p id="id02739" class="calibre1">That was helpful. Now to find seven digits. Anthrax looked across the
street at the fish and chips shop. No numbers there. Then a car
licence plate caught his eye. He read off the first three digits, then
plucked the last four numbers from another car's plate.</p>

<p id="id02740" class="calibre1">`Thank you. Putting your call through, Mr Baker.'</p>

<p id="id02741" class="calibre1">A valid number! What amazing luck. Anthrax milked that number for all
it was worth. Called party lines. Called phreakers' bridges. Access
fed the obsession.</p>

<p id="id02742" class="calibre1">Then he gave the number to a friend in Adelaide, to call overseas. But
when that friend read off the code, the operator jumped in.</p>

<h5 id="id02743" class="calibre9">`YOU'RE NOT MR BAKER!'</h5>

<p id="id02744" class="calibre1">Huh? `Yes I am. You have my code.'</p>

<p id="id02745" class="calibre1">`You are definitely not him. I know his voice.'</p>

<p id="id02746" class="calibre1">The friend called Anthrax, who laughed his head off, then called into
Dialcom and changed his code! It was a funny incident. Still, it
reminded him how much safer it was working by himself.</p>

<p id="id02747" class="calibre1">Living in the country was hard for a hacker and Anthrax became a
phreaker out of necessity, not just desire. Almost everything involved
a long-distance call and he was always searching for ways to make
calls for free. He noticed that when he called certain 008
numbers—free calls—the phone would ring a few times, click, and then
pause briefly before ringing some more. Eventually a company
representative or answering service picked up the call. Anthrax had
read about diverters, devices used to forward calls automatically, in
one of the many telecommunications magazines and manuals he was
constantly reading. The click suggested the call was going through a
diverter and he guessed that if he punched in the right tones at the
right moment, he could make the call divert away from a company's
customer service agent. Furthermore, any line trace would end up at
the company.</p>

<p id="id02748" class="calibre1">Antrax collected some 008 numbers and fiddled with them. He discovered
that if he punched another number in very quickly over the top of the
ringing—just after the click—he could make the line divert to where
he wanted it to go. He used the 008 numbers to ring phone conferences
around the world, where he hung out with other phreakers, particularly
Canadians such as members of the Toronto-based UPI or the Montreal
group, NPC, which produced a phreakers' manual in French. The
conversation on the phreaker's phone conferences, or phone bridges as
they are often called, inevitably turned to planning a prank. And
those Canadian guys knew how to prank!</p>

<p id="id02749" class="calibre1">Once, they rang the emergency phone number in a major Canadian city.
Using the Canadian incarnation of his social engineering accents,
Anthrax called in a `police officer in need of assistance'. The
operator wanted to know where. The phreakers had decided on the Blue
Ribbon Ice-Cream Parlour. They always picked a spot within visual
range of at least one member, so they could see what was happening.</p>

<p id="id02750" class="calibre1">In the split second of silence which followed, one of the five other
phreakers quietly eavesdropping on the call coughed. It was a short,
sharp cough. The operator darted back on the line.</p>

<p id="id02751" class="calibre1">`Was that A GUN SHOT? Are you SHOT? Hello? John?' The operator leaned
away from her receiver for a moment and the phreakers heard her
talking to someone else in the background. `Officer down.'</p>

<p id="id02752" class="calibre1">Things moved so fast when pranking. What to do now?</p>

<p id="id02753" class="calibre1">`Ah, yeah. Yeah.' It was amazing how much someone squeezing laughter
back down his oesophagus can sound like someone who has been shot.</p>

<p id="id02754" class="calibre1">`John, talk to me. Talk to me,' the operator pleaded into the phone,
trying to keep John alert.</p>

<p id="id02755" class="calibre1">`I'm down. I'm down,' Anthrax strung her along.</p>

<p id="id02756" class="calibre1">Anthrax disconnected the operator from the conference call. Then the
phreaker who lived near the ice-cream parlour announced the street had
been blocked off by police cars. They had the parlour surrounded and
were anxiously searching for an injured fellow officer. It took
several hours before the police realised someone had played a mean
trick on them.</p>

<p id="id02757" class="calibre1">However, Anthrax's favourite prank was Mr McKenny, the befuddled
southern American hick. Anthrax had selected the phone number at
random, but the first prank was such fun he kept coming back for more.
He had been ringing Mr McKenny for years. It was always the same
conversation.</p>

<p id="id02758" class="calibre1">`Mr McKenny? This is Peter Baker. I'd like my shovel back, please.'</p>

<p id="id02759" class="calibre1">`I don't have your shovel.'</p>

<p id="id02760" class="calibre1">`Yeah, I lent it to you. Lent it to you like two years ago. I want it
back now.'</p>

<p id="id02761" class="calibre1">`I never borrowed no shovel from you. Go away.'</p>

<p id="id02762" class="calibre1">`You did. You borrowed that shovel of mine. And if you don't give it
back I'm a gonna come round and get it myself. And you won't like it.
Now, when you gonna give me that shovel back?'</p>

<p id="id02763" class="calibre1">`Damn it! I don't have your goddamn shovel!'</p>

<p id="id02764" class="calibre1">`Give me my shovel!'</p>

<p id="id02765" class="calibre1">`Stop calling me! I've never had your friggin' shovel. Let me be!'<br class="calibre4"/>

Click.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02766" class="calibre1">Nine in the morning. Eight at night. Two a.m. There would be no peace
for Mr McKenny until he admitted borrowing that shovel from a boy half
his age and half a world away.</p>

<p id="id02767" class="calibre1">Sometimes Anthrax pranked closer to home. The Trading Post, a weekly
rag of personals from people selling and buying, served as a good
place to begin. Always the innocent start, to lure them in.</p>

<p id="id02768" class="calibre1">`Yes, sir, I see you advertised that you wanted to buy a bathtub.'<br class="calibre4"/>

Anthrax put on his serious voice. `I have a bathtub for sale.'<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02769" class="calibre1">`Yeah? What sort? Do you have the measurements, and the model number?'<br class="calibre4"/>

And people thought phreakers were weird.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02770" class="calibre1">`Ah, no model number. But its about a metre and a half long, has feet,
in the shape of claws. It's older style, off-white. There's only one
problem.' Anthrax paused, savouring the moment.</p>

<p id="id02771" class="calibre1">`Oh? What's that?'</p>

<p id="id02772" class="calibre1">`There's a body in it.'</p>

<p id="id02773" class="calibre1">Like dropping a boulder in a peaceful pond.</p>

<p id="id02774" class="calibre2">The list on System X had dial-up modem numbers, along with usernames
and password pairs for each address. These usernames were not words
like `jsmith' or `jdoe', and the passwords would not have appeared in
any dictionary. 12[AZ63. K5M82L. The type of passwords and usernames
only a computer would remember.</p>

<p id="id02775" class="calibre1">This, of course, made sense, since a computer picked them out in the
first place. It generated them randomly. The list wasn't particularly
user-friendly. It didn't have headers, outlining what each item
related to. This made sense too. The list wasn't meant to be read by
humans.</p>

<p id="id02776" class="calibre1">Occasionally, there were comments in the list. Programmers often
include a line of comment in code, which is delineated in such a way
that the computer skips over the words when interpreting the commands.
The comments are for other programmers examining the code. In this
case, the comments were places. Fort Green. Fort Myers. Fort Ritchie.
Dozens and dozens of forts. Almost half of them were not on the
mainland US. They were in places like the Philippines, Turkey,
Germany, Guam. Places with lots of US military presence.</p>

<p id="id02777" class="calibre1">Not that these bases were any secret to the locals, or indeed to many
Americans. Anthrax knew that anyone could discover a base existed
through perfectly legal means. The vast majority of people never
thought to look. But once they saw such a list, particularly from the
environment of a military computer's bowels, it tended to drive the
point home. The point being that the US military seemed to be
everywhere.</p>

<p id="id02778" class="calibre1">Anthrax logged out of System X, killed all his connections and hung up
the phone. It was time to move on. Routing through a few
out-of-the-way connections, he called one of the numbers on the list.
The username-password combination worked. He looked around. It was as
he expected. This wasn't a computer. It was a telephone exchange. It
looked like a NorTel DMS 100.</p>

<p id="id02779" class="calibre1">Hackers and phreakers usually have areas of expertise. In Australian
terms, Anthrax was a master of the X.25 network and a king of voice
mailbox systems, and others in the underground recognised him as such.
He knew Trilogues better than most company technicians. He knew
Meridian VMB systems better than almost anyone in Australia. In the
phreaking community, he was also a world-class expert in Aspen VMB
systems. He did not, however, have any expertise in DMS 100s.</p>

<p id="id02780" class="calibre1">Anthrax quickly hunted through his hacking disks for a text file on
DMS 100s he had copied from an underground BBS. The pressure was on.
He didn't want to spend long inside the exchange, maybe only fifteen
or twenty minutes tops. The longer he stayed without much of a clue
about how the thing operated, the greater the risk of his being
traced. When he found the disk with the text file, he began sorting
through it while still on-line at the telephone exchange. The
phreakers' file showed him some basic commands, things which let him
gently prod the exchange for basic information without disturbing the
system too much. He didn't want to do much more for fear of
inadvertently mutilating the system.</p>

<p id="id02781" class="calibre1">Although he was not an authority on DMS 100s, Anthrax had an old
hacker friend overseas who was a real genius on NorTel equipment. He
gave the list to his friend. Yes, the friend confirmed it was indeed a
DMS 100 exchange at a US military base. It was not part of the normal
telephone system, though. This exchange was part of a military phone
system.</p>

<p id="id02782" class="calibre1">In times of war, the military doesn't want to be dependent on the
civilian telephone system. Even in times of peace, voice
communications between military staff are more secure if they don't
talk on an exchange used by civilians. For this and a variety of other
reasons, the military have separate telephone networks, just as they
have separate networks for their data communications. These networks
operate like a normal network and in some cases can communicate to the
outside world by connecting through their own exchanges to civilian
ones.</p>

<p id="id02783" class="calibre1">When Anthrax got the word from the expert hacker, he made up his mind
quickly. Up went the sniffer. System X was getting more interesting by
the hour and he didn't want to miss a precious minute in the information
gathering game when it came to this system.</p>

<p id="id02784" class="calibre1">The sniffer, a well-used program rumoured to be written by a
Sydney-based Unix hacker called Rockstar, sat on System X under an
innocuous name, silently tracking everyone who logged in and out of
the system. It recorded the first 128 characters of every telnet
connection that went across the ethernet network cable to which System
X was attached. Those 128 bytes included the username and the
passwords people used to log in. Sniffers were effective, but they
needed time. Usually, they grew like an embryo in a healthy womb,
slowly but steadily.</p>

<p id="id02785" class="calibre1">Anthrax resolved to return to System X in twelve hours to check on the
baby.</p>

<p id="id02786" class="calibre2">`Why are you two watching those nigger video clips?'</p>

<p id="id02787" class="calibre1">It was an offensive question, but not atypical for Anthrax's father.
He often breezed through the house, leaving a trail of disruption in
his wake.</p>

<p id="id02788" class="calibre1">Soon, however, Anthrax began eroding his father's authority. He
discovered his father's secrets hidden on the Commodore 64 computer.
Letters—lots of them—to his family in England. Vicious, racist,
horrid letters telling how his wife was stupid. How she had to be told
how to do everything, like a typical Indian. How he regretted marrying
her. There were other matters too, things unpleasant to discuss.</p>

<p id="id02789" class="calibre1">Anthrax confronted his father, who denied the allegations at first,
then finally told Anthrax to keep his mouth shut and mind his own
business. But Anthrax told his mother. Tensions erupted and, for a
time, Anthrax's parents saw a marriage counsellor.</p>

<p id="id02790" class="calibre1">But his father did not give up writing the letters. He put a password
protection program on the word processor to keep his son out of his
business. It was a futile effort. His father had chosen the wrong
medium to record his indiscretions.</p>

<p id="id02791" class="calibre1">Anthrax showed his mother the new letters and continued to confront
his father. When the tension in the house grew, Anthrax would escape
with his friends. One night they were at a nightclub when someone
started taunting Anthrax, calling him `curry muncher' and worse.</p>

<p id="id02792" class="calibre1">That was it. The anger which had been simmering below the surface for
so long exploded as Anthrax violently attacked his taunter, hitting,
kicking and punching him, using the tai kwon do combinations he had
been learning. There was blood and it felt good. Vengeance tasted
sweet.</p>

<p id="id02793" class="calibre1">After that incident, Anthrax often lashed out violently. He was out of
control and it sometimes scared him. However, at times he went looking
for trouble. Once he tracked down a particularly seedy character who
had tried to rape one of his girlfriends. Anthrax pulled a knife on
the guy, but the incident had little to do with the girl. The thing
that made him angry was the disrespect. This guy knew the girl was
with Anthrax. The attempted rape was like spitting in his face.</p>

<p id="id02794" class="calibre1">Perhaps that's what appealed to Anthrax about Islam—the importance of
respect. At sixteen he found Islam and it changed his life. He
discovered the Qu'raan in the school library while researching an
assignment on religion. About the same time, he began listening to a
lot of rap music. More than half the American rappers in his music
collection were Muslim, and many sang about the Nation of Islam and
the sect's charismatic leader, Minister Louis Farrakhan. Their songs
described the injustices whites inflicted on blacks. They told blacks
to demand respect.</p>

<p id="id02795" class="calibre1">Anthrax found a magazine article about Farrakhan and began reading
books like the Autobiography of Malcolm X. Then he rang up the Nation
of Islam head office in Chicago and asked them to send some
information. The Final Call, the NOI newsletter, arrived one day,
followed by other literature which began appearing around Anthrax's
home. Under the TV guide. On the coffee table. Amid the pile of
newspapers. On top of his computer. Anthrax often took time to read
articles aloud to his mother while she did housework.</p>

<p id="id02796" class="calibre1">In the middle of 1990, when Anthrax was in year 11, his father
suggested the boy attend Catholic boarding school in Melbourne. The
school was inexpensive and the family could scrape and save to pay the
fees. Anthrax disliked the idea, but his father insisted.</p>

<p id="id02797" class="calibre1">Anthrax and his new school proved a bad match. The school thought he
asked too many questions, and Anthrax thought the school answered too
few of them. The hypocrisy of the Catholic church riled Anthrax and
pushed him further into the arms of NOI. How could he respect an
institution which had sanctioned slavery as a righteous and
progressive method of converting people? The school and Anthrax parted
on less than friendly terms after just one semester.</p>

<p id="id02798" class="calibre1">The Catholic school intensified a feeling of inferiority Anthrax had
felt for many years. He was an outsider. The wrong colour, the wrong
size, too intelligent for his school. Yet, NOI's Minister Farrakhan
told him that he wasn't inferior at all. `I know that you have been
discriminated against because of your colour,' Farrakhan told Anthrax
from the tape player. `Let me tell you why. Let me tell you about the
origins of the white race and how they were put on this earth to do
evil. They have shown themselves to be nothing but an enemy of the
East. Non-whites are the original people of the earth.'</p>

<p id="id02799" class="calibre1">Anthrax found some deep veins of truth in NOI's teachings. Interracial
marriages don't work. A white man marries a non-white woman because he
wants a slave, not because he loves and respects her. Islam respects
women in more meaningful ways than Western religions. Perhaps it wasn't
the type of respect that Western men were used to giving women, but he
had seen that kind of respect in his own home and he didn't think much
of it.</p>

<p id="id02800" class="calibre1">Anthrax read the words of the Honourable Elijah Muhammad, founder of
NOI: `The enemy does not have to be a real devil. He could be your
father, mother, brother, husband, wife or children. Many times they're
in your own household. Today is the great time of separation of the
righteous Muslim and the wicked white race.' Anthrax looked inside his
own household and saw what seemed to be a devil. A white devil.</p>

<p id="id02801" class="calibre1">NOI fed Anthrax's mind. He followed up the lists of literature
included in every issue of The Final Call. Books like Black Athena by
Martin Bernel and Deterring Democracy by Noam Chomsky had common
themes of conspiracy and oppression by the haves against the
have-nots. Anthrax read them all.</p>

<p id="id02802" class="calibre1">The transformation of Anthrax occurred over a period of six months. He
didn't talk about it much with his parents. It was a private matter.
But his mother later told him his adoption of the religion didn't
surprise her. His great-grandfather had been a Muslim scholar and
cleric in India. It was fate. His conversion presented a certain sense
of closure, of completing the circle.</p>

<p id="id02803" class="calibre1">His interest in Islam found secular outlets. A giant black and white
poster of Malcolm X appeared on Anthrax's bedroom wall. A huge photo
of Los Angeles Black Panther leader Elmer Pratt followed soon after.
The photo was captioned, `A coward dies a million deaths, a brave man
dies but one'. The last bit of wall was covered in posters of hip-hop
bands from ceiling to floor. A traditional Indian sword adorned the
top of one of the many bookcases. It complemented the growing
collection of books on martial arts. A well-loved copy of The Art of
War by Sun Tzu sat on the shelf next to Homer's Ulysses, The Lord of
The Rings, The Hobbit, a few old Dungeons and Dragons books, works of
mythology from India and Egypt. The shelves did not contain a single
work of science fiction. Anthrax shaved his head. His mother may not
have been surprised by the conversion to Islam, but the head shaving
went a bit over the top.</p>

<p id="id02804" class="calibre1">Anthrax pursued NOI with the same vigour with which he attacked
hacking. He memorised whole speeches of Farrakhan and began speaking
like him, commenting casually on `those caucasian, blue-eyed devils'.
He quoted people he had discovered through NOI. People who described
the US Federal Reserve Bank as being controlled by Jews. People who
spoke of those hooked-nose, bagel-eating, just-crawled-out-of-a-cave
Jews. Anthrax denied the existence of the Holocaust.</p>

<p id="id02805" class="calibre1">`You're shaping up to be quite a little Hitler,' his father told<br class="calibre4"/>

Anthrax.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02806" class="calibre1">His father disliked the NOI literature showing up at the house. It
seemed to frighten him. Receiving blueprints in the mail for
overthowing governments didn't sit well with the neighbours in the
quiet suburban street of the provincial town.</p>

<p id="id02807" class="calibre1">`Watch out,' he warned his son. `Having these thing turn up in your
mailbox can be dangerous. It will probably earmark you for some sort
of investigation. They will follow you around.'</p>

<p id="id02808" class="calibre2">The traffic raced. The ethernet cables attached to System X were a
regular speedway. People whizzed in and out of the mystery site like a
swarm of bees. In only twelve hours, the sniffer file topped 100 k.</p>

<p id="id02809" class="calibre1">Many of the connections went from System X to the major
telecommunications company. Anthrax headed in that direction.</p>

<p id="id02810" class="calibre1">He considered how to route the attack. He could go through a few
diverters and other leapfrog devices to cover his trail, thus hitting
the company's system from a completely separate source. The advantage
of this route was anonymity. If the admin managed to detect his entry,
Anthrax would only lose access to the phone company's system, not to
System X. Alternatively, if he went in to the company through the
gateway and System X, he risked alarms being raised at all three
sites. However, his sniffer showed so much traffic running on this
route, he might simply disappear in the flow. The established path was
obviously there for a reason. One more person logging into the gateway
through System X and then into the company's machine would not raise
suspicions. He chose to go through System X.</p>

<p id="id02811" class="calibre1">Anthrax logged into the company using a sniffed username and password.
Trying the load-module bug again, he got root on the system and
installed his own login patch. The company's system looked far more
normal than System X. A few hundred users. Lots of email, far too much
to read. He ran a few key word searches on all the email, trying to
piece together a better picture of the project being developed on
System X.</p>

<p id="id02812" class="calibre1">The company did plenty of defence work, mostly in telecommunications.
Different divisions of the company seemed to be working on different
segments of the project. Anthrax searched through people's home
directories, but nothing looked very interesting because he couldn't
get a handle on the whole project. People were all developing
different modules of the project and, without a centralised overview,
the pieces didn't mean much.</p>

<p id="id02813" class="calibre1">He did find a group of binary files—types of programs—but he had no
idea what they were for. The only real way to find out what they did
was to take them for a test drive. He ran a few binaries. They didn't
appear to do anything. He ran a few more. Again, nothing. He kept
running them, one after another. Still no results. All he received was
error messages.</p>

<p id="id02814" class="calibre1">The binaries seemed to need a monitor which could display graphics.
They used XII, a graphical display common on Unix systems. Anthrax's
inexpensive home computer didn't have that sort of graphical display
operating system. He could still run the binaries by telling System X
to run them on one of its local terminals, but he wouldn't be able to
see the output on his home computer. More importantly, it was a risky
course of action. What if someone happened to be sitting at the
terminal where he chose to run the binary? The game would be up.</p>

<p id="id02815" class="calibre1">He leaned away from his keyboard and stretched. Exhaustion was
beginning to set in. He hadn't slept in almost 48 hours. Occasionally,
he had left his computer terminal to eat, though he always brought the
food back to the screen. His mother popped her head in the doorway
once in a while and shook her head silently. When he noticed her
there, he tried to ease her concerns. `But I'm learning lots of
things,' he pleaded. She was not convinced.</p>

<p id="id02816" class="calibre1">He also broke his long hacking session to pray. It was important for a
devout Muslim to practice salat—to pray at least five times a day
depending on the branch of Islam followed by the devotee. Islam allows
followers to group some of their prayers, so Anthrax usually grouped
two in the morning, prayed once at midday as normal, and grouped two
more at night. An efficient way to meet religious obligations.</p>

<p id="id02817" class="calibre1">Sometimes the time just slipped away, hacking all night. When the
first hint of dawn snuck up on him, he was invariably in the middle of
some exciting journey. But duty was duty, and it had to be done. So he
pressed control S to freeze his screen, unfurled the prayer mat with
its built-in compass, faced Mecca, knelt down and did two sets of
prayers before sunrise. Ten minutes later he rolled the prayer mat up,
slid back into his chair, typed control Q to release the pause on his
computer and picked up where he left off.</p>

<p id="id02818" class="calibre1">This company's computer system seemed to confirm what he had begun to
suspect. System X was the first stage of a project, the rest of which
was under development. He found a number of tables and reports in
System X's files. The reports carried headers like `Traffic Analysis',
`calls in' and `calls out', `failure rate'. It all began to make sense
to Anthrax.</p>

<p id="id02819" class="calibre1">System X called up each of the military telephone exchanges in that
list. It logged in using the computer-generated name and password.
Once inside, a program in System X polled the exchange for important
statistics, such as the number of calls coming in and out of the base.
This information was then stored on System X. Whenever someone wanted
a report on something, for example, the military sites with the most
incoming calls over the past 24 hours, he or she would simply ask
System X to compile the information. All of this was done
automatically.</p>

<p id="id02820" class="calibre1">Anthrax had read some email suggesting that changes to an exchange,
such as adding new telephone lines on the base, had been handled
manually, but this job was soon to be done automatically by System X.
It made sense. The maintenance time spent by humans would be cut
dramatically.</p>

<p id="id02821" class="calibre1">A machine which gathers statistics and services phone exchanges
remotely doesn't sound very sexy on the face of it, until you begin to
consider what you could do with something like that. You could sell it
to a foreign power interested in the level of activity at a certain
base at a particular time. And that is just the beginning.</p>

<p id="id02822" class="calibre1">You could tap any unencrypted line going in or out of any of the 100
or so exchanges and listen in to sensitive military discussions. Just
a few commands makes you a fly on the wall of a general's conversation
to the head of a base in the Philippines. Anti-government rebels in
that country might pay a pretty penny for getting intelligence on the
US forces.</p>

<p id="id02823" class="calibre1">All of those options paled next to the most striking power wielded by
a hacker who had unlimited access to System X and the 100 or so
telephone exchanges. He could take down that US military voice
communications system almost overnight, and he could do it
automatically. The potential for havoc creation was breathtaking. It
would be a small matter for a skilled programmer to alter the
automated program used by System X. Instead of using its dozen or more
modems to dial all the exchanges overnight and poll them for
statistics, System X could be instructed to call them overnight and
reprogram the exchanges.</p>

<p id="id02824" class="calibre1">What if every time General Colin Powell picked up his phone, he was be
automatically patched through to some Russian general's office? He
wouldn't be able to dial any other number from his office phone. He'd
pick up his phone to dial and there would be the Russian at the other
end. And what if every time someone called into the general's number,
they ended up talking to the stationery department? What if none of the
phone numbers connected to their proper telephones?  No-one would be
able to reach one another. An important part of the US military machine
would be in utter disarray. Now, what if all this happened in the first
few days of a war? People trying to contact each other with vital
information wouldn't be able to use the telephone exchanges reprogrammed
by System X.</p>

<p id="id02825" class="calibre1">THAT was power.</p>

<p id="id02826" class="calibre1">It wasn't like Anthrax screaming at his father until his voice turned
to a whisper, all for nothing. He could make people sit up and take
notice with this sort of power.</p>

<p id="id02827" class="calibre1">Hacking a system gave him a sense of control. Getting root on a system
always gave him an adrenalin rush for just that reason. It meant the
system was his, he could do whatever he wanted, he could run whatever
processes or programs he desired, he could remove other users he
didn't want using his system. He thought, I own the system. The word
`own' anchored the phrase which circled through his thoughts again and
again when he successfully hacked a system.</p>

<p id="id02828" class="calibre1">The sense of ownership was almost passionate, rippled with streaks of
obsession and jealousy. At any given moment, Anthrax had a list of
systems he owned and that had captured his interest for that moment.
Anthrax hated seeing a system administrator logging onto one of those
systems. It was an invasion. It was as though Anthrax had just got
this woman he had been after for some time alone in a room with the
door closed. Then, just as he was getting to know her, this other guy
had barged in, sat down on the couch and started talking to her.</p>

<p id="id02829" class="calibre1">It was never enough to look at a system from a distance and know he
could hack it if he wanted to. Anthrax had to actually hack the
system. He had to own it. He needed to see what was inside the system,
to know exactly what it was he owned.</p>

<p id="id02830" class="calibre1">The worst thing admins could do was to fiddle with system security.
That made Anthrax burn with anger. If Anthrax was on-line, silently
observing the admins' activities, he would feel a sudden urge to log
them off. He wanted to punish them. Wanted them to know he was into
their system. And yet, at the same time, he didn't want them to know.
Logging them off would draw attention to himself, but the two desires
pulled at him from opposite directions. What Anthrax really wanted was
for the admins to know he controlled their system, but for them not to
be able to do anything about it. He wanted them to be helpless.</p>

<p id="id02831" class="calibre1">Anthrax decided to keep undercover. But he contemplated the power of
having System X's list of telephone exchange dial-ups and their
username-password combinations. Normally, it would take days for a
single hacker with his lone modem to have much impact on the US
military's communications network. Sure, he could take down a few
exchanges before the military wised up and started protecting
themselves. It was like hacking a military computer. You could take
out a machine here, a system there. But the essence of the power of
System X was being able to use its own resources to orchestrate
widespread pandemonium quickly and quietly.</p>

<p id="id02832" class="calibre1">Anthrax defines power as the potential for real world impact. At that
moment of discovery and realisation, the real world impact of hacking
System X looked good. The telecommunications company computer seemed
like a good place to hang up a sniffer, so he plugged one into the
machine and decided to return in a little while. Then he logged out
and went to bed.</p>

<p id="id02833" class="calibre1">When he revisited the sniffer a day or so later, Anthrax received a
rude shock. Scrolling through the sniffer file, he did a double take
on one of the entries. Someone had logged into the company's system
using his special login patch password.</p>

<p id="id02834" class="calibre1">He tried to stay calm. He thought hard. When was the last time he had
logged into the system using that special password? Could his sniffer
have logged himself on an earlier hacking session? It did happen
occasionally. Hackers sometimes gave themselves quite a fright. In the
seamless days and nights of hacking dozens of systems, it was easy to
forget the last time you logged into a particular system using the
special password. The more he thought, the more he was absolutely
sure. He hadn't logged into the system again.</p>

<p id="id02835" class="calibre1">Which left the obvious question. Who had?</p>

<p id="id02836" class="calibre2">Sometimes Anthrax pranked, sometimes he punished. Punishment could be
severe or mild. Generally it was severe. And unlike pranking, it was
not done randomly.</p>

<p id="id02837" class="calibre1">Different things set him off. The librarian, for example. In early
1993 Anthrax had enrolled in Asia-Pacific and Business Studies at a
university in a nearby regional city. Ever since he showed up on the
campus, he had been hassled by a student who worked part-time at the
university library. On more than one occasion, Anthrax had been
reading at a library table when a security guard came up and asked to
search his bags. And when Anthrax looked over his shoulder to the
check-out desk, that librarian was always there, the one with the bad
attitude smeared across his face.</p>

<p id="id02838" class="calibre1">The harassment became so noticeable, Anthrax's friends began
commenting on it. His bag would be hand-searched when he left the
library, while other students walked through the electronic security
boom gate unbothered. When he returned a book one day late, the
librarian—that librarian—insisted he pay all sorts of fines.
Anthrax's pleas of being a poor student fell on deaf ears. By the time
exam period rolled around at the end of term, Anthrax decided to
punish the librarian by taking down the library's entire computer
system.</p>

<p id="id02839" class="calibre1">Logging in to the library computer via modem from home, Anthrax
quickly gained root privileges. The system had security holes a mile
wide. Then, with one simple command, he deleted every file in the
computer. He knew the system would be backed up somewhere, but it
would take a day or two to get the system up and running again. In the
meantime, every loan or book search had to be conducted manually.</p>

<p id="id02840" class="calibre1">During Anthrax's first year at university, even small incidents
provoked punishment. Cutting him off while he was driving, or swearing
at him on the road, fit the bill. Anthrax would memorise the licence
plate of the offending driver, then social engineer the driver's
personal details. Usually he called the police to report what appeared
to be a stolen car and then provided the licence plate number. Shortly
after, Anthrax tuned into to his police scanner, where he picked up
the driver's name and address as it was read over the airways to the
investigating police car. Anthrax wrote it all down.</p>

<p id="id02841" class="calibre1">Then began the process of punishment. Posing as the driver, Anthrax rang
the driver's electricity company to arrange a power disconnection. The
next morning the driver might return home to find his electricity cut
off. The day after, his gas might be disconnected.  Then his water. Then
his phone.</p>

<p id="id02842" class="calibre1">Some people warranted special punishment—people such as Bill. Anthrax
came across Bill on the Swedish Party Line, an English-speaking
telephone conference. For a time, Anthrax was a regular fixture on the
line, having attempted to call it by phreaking more than 2000 times
over just a few months. Of course, not all those attempts were
successful, but he managed to get through at least half the time. It
required quite an effort to keep a presence on the party line, since
it automatically cut people off after only ten minutes. Anthrax made
friends with the operators, who sometimes let him stay on-line a while
longer.</p>

<p id="id02843" class="calibre1">Bill, a Swedish Party Line junkie, had recently been released from
prison, where he had served time for beating up a Vietnamese boy at a
railway station. He had a bad attitude and he often greeted the party
line by saying, `Are there any coons on the line today?' His attitude
to women wasn't much better. He relentlessly hit on the women who
frequented the line. One day, he made a mistake. He gave out his phone
number to a girl he was trying to pick up. The operator copied it down
and when her friend Anthrax came on later that day, she passed it on
to him.</p>

<p id="id02844" class="calibre1">Anthrax spent a few weeks social engineering various people, including
utilities and relatives whose telephone numbers appeared on Bill's
phone accounts, to piece together the details of his life. Bill was a
rough old ex-con who owned a budgie and was dying of cancer. Anthrax
phoned Bill in the hospital and proceeded to tell him all sorts of
personal details about himself, the kind of details which upset a
person.</p>

<p id="id02845" class="calibre1">Not long after, Anthrax heard that Bill had died. The hacker felt as
though he had perhaps gone a bit too far.</p>

<p id="id02846" class="calibre2">The tension at home had eased a little by the time Anthrax left to
attend university. But when he returned home during holidays he found
his father even more unbearable. More and more, Anthrax rebelled
against his father's sniping comments and violence. Eventually, he
vowed that the next time his father tried to break his arm he would
fight back. And he did.</p>

<p id="id02847" class="calibre1">One day Anthrax's father began making bitter fun of his younger son's
stutter. Brimming with biting sarcasm, the father mimicked Anthrax's
brother.</p>

<p id="id02848" class="calibre1">`Why are you doing that?' Anthrax yelled. The bait had worked once
again.</p>

<p id="id02849" class="calibre1">It was as though he became possessed with a spirit not his own. He
yelled at his father, and put a fist into the wall. His father grabbed
a chair and thrust it forward to keep Anthrax at bay, then reached
back for the phone. Said he was calling the police. Anthrax ripped the
phone from the wall. He pursued his father through the house, smashing
furniture. Amid the crashing violence of the fight, Anthrax suddenly
felt a flash of fear for his mother's clock—a much loved, delicate
family heirloom. He gently picked it up and placed it out of harm's
way. Then he heaved the stereo into the air and threw it at his
father. The stereo cabinet followed in its wake. Wardrobes toppled
with a crash across the floor.</p>

<p id="id02850" class="calibre1">When his father fled the house, Anthrax got a hold of himself and
began to look around. The place was a disaster area. All those things
so tenderly gathered and carefully treasured by his mother, the things
she had used to build her life in a foreign land of white people
speaking an alien tongue, lay in fragments scattered around the house.</p>

<p id="id02851" class="calibre1">Anthrax felt wretched. His mother was distraught at the destruction
and he was badly shaken by how much it upset her. He promised to try
and control his temper from that moment on. It proved to be a constant
battle. Mostly he would win, but not always. The battle still simmered
below the surface.</p>

<p id="id02852" class="calibre1">Sometimes it boiled over.</p>

<p id="id02853" class="calibre2">Anthrax considered the possibilities of who else would be using his
login patch. It could be another hacker, perhaps someone who was
running another sniffer that logged Anthrax's previous login. But it
was more likely to be a security admin. Meaning he had been found out.
Meaning that he might be being traced even as he leap-frogged through
System X to the telecommunications company's computer.</p>

<p id="id02854" class="calibre1">Anthrax made his way to the system admin's mailboxes. If the game was
up, chances were something in the mailbox would give it away.</p>

<p id="id02855" class="calibre1">There it was. The evidence. They were onto him all right, and they
hadn't wasted any time. The admins had mailed CERT, the Computer
Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University, reporting a
security breach. CERT, the nemesis of every Internet hacker, was bound
to complicate matters. Law enforcement would no doubt be called in
now.</p>

<p id="id02856" class="calibre1">It was time to get out of this system, but not before leaving in a
blaze of glory. A prank left as a small present.</p>

<p id="id02857" class="calibre1">CERT had written back to the admins acknowledging the incident and
providing a case number. Posing as one of the admins, Anthrax drafted
a letter to CERT. To make the thing look official, he added the case
number `for reference'. The letter went something like this:</p>

<p id="id02858" class="calibre1">`In regard to incident no. XXXXX, reported on this date, we have since
carried out some additional investigations on the matter. We have
discovered the security incident was caused by a disgruntled employee
who was fired for alcoholism and decided to retaliate against the
company in this manner.</p>

<p id="id02859" class="calibre1">`We have long had a problem with alcohol and drug abuse due to the
stressful nature of the company environment. No further investigation
is necessary.'</p>

<p id="id02860" class="calibre1">At his computer terminal, Anthrax smiled. How embarrassing was that
going to be? Try scraping that mud off. He felt very pleased with
himself.</p>

<p id="id02861" class="calibre1">Anthrax then tidied up his things in the company's computer, deleted
the sniffer and moved out.</p>

<p id="id02862" class="calibre1">Things began to move quickly after that. He logged into System X later
to check the sniffer records, only to find that someone had used his
login patch password on that system as well. He became very nervous.
It was one thing goofing around with a commercial site, and quite
another being tracked from a military computer.</p>

<p id="id02863" class="calibre1">A new process had been added to System X, which Anthrax recognised. It
was called `-u'. He didn't know what it did, but he had seen it before
on military systems. About 24 hours after it appeared, he found
himself locked out of the system. He had tried killing off the -u
process before. It disappeared for a split-second and reappeared. Once
it was in place, there was no way to destroy it.</p>

<p id="id02864" class="calibre1">Anthrax also unearthed some alarming email. The admin at a site
upstream from both System X and the company's system had been sent a
warning letter: `We think there has been a security incident at your
site'. The circle was closing in on him. It was definitely time to get
the hell out. He packed up his things in a hurry. Killed off the
remaining sniffer. Moved his files. Removed the login patch. And
departed with considerable alacrity.</p>

<p id="id02865" class="calibre1">After he cut his connection, Anthrax sat wondering about the admins.
If they knew he was into their systems, why did they leave the
sniffers up and running? He could understand leaving the login patch.
Maybe they wanted to track his movements, determine his motives, or
trace his connection. Killing the patch would have simply locked him
out of the only door the admins could watch. They wouldn't know if he
had other backdoors into their system. But the sniffer? It didn't make
any sense.</p>

<p id="id02866" class="calibre1">It was possible that they simply hadn't seen the sniffer. Leaving it
there had been an oversight. But it was almost too glaring an error to
be a real possibility. If it was an error, it implied the admins
weren't actually monitoring the connections in and out of their
systems. If they had been watching the connections, they would
probably have seen the sniffer. But if they weren't monitoring the
connections, how on earth did they find out his special password for
the login patch? Like all passwords on the system, that one was
encrypted. There were only two ways to get that password. Monitor the
connection and sniff it, or break the encryption with a brute-force
attack.</p>

<p id="id02867" class="calibre1">Breaking the encryption would probably have taken millions of dollars
of computer time. He could pretty well rule that option out. That left
sniffing it, which would have alerted them to his own sniffer. Surely
they wouldn't have left his sniffer running on purpose. They must have
known he would learn they were watching him through his sniffer. The
whole thing was bizarre.</p>

<p id="id02868" class="calibre1">Anthrax thought about the admins who were chasing him. Thought about
their moves, their strategies. Wondered why. It was one of the
unsolved mysteries a hacker often faced—an unpleasant side of
hacking. Missing the answers to certain questions, the satisfaction of
a certain curiosity. Never being able to look over the fence at the
other side.</p>

<h4 id="id02869" class="calibre11">                   Chapter 11 — The Prisoner's Dilemma.</h4>

<p id="id02870" class="calibre2">Harrisburg Oh Harrisburg; The plant is melting down; The people out in Harrisbug; Are getting out of town; And when this stuff gets in; You cannot get it out .</p>

<p id="id02871" class="calibre1">— from `Harrisburg', Red Sails in the Sunset.</p>

<p id="id02872" class="calibre1">Anthrax thought he would never get caught. But in some strange way, he
also wanted to get caught. When he thought about being busted, he
found himself filled with a strange emotion—impatience. Bring on the
impending doom and be done with it. Or perhaps it was frustration at
how inept his opponents seemed to be. They kept losing his trail and
he was impatient with their incompetence. It was more fun outwitting a
worthy opponent.</p>

<p id="id02873" class="calibre1">Perhaps he didn't really want to be caught so much as tracked. Anthrax
liked the idea of the police tracking him, of the system
administrators pursuing him. He liked to follow the trail of their
investigations through other people's mail. He especially liked being
on-line, watching them trying to figure out where he was coming from.
He would cleverly take control of their computers in ways they
couldn't see. He watched every character they typed, every spelling
error, every mistyped command, each twist and turn taken in the vain
hope of catching him.</p>

<p id="id02874" class="calibre1">He hadn't been caught back in early 1991, when it seemed everyone was
after him. In fact Anthrax nearly gave up hacking and phreaking
completely in that year after what he later called `The Fear of God'
speech.</p>

<p id="id02875" class="calibre1">Late at night, on a university computer system, he bumped into another
hacker. It wasn't an entirely uncommon experience. Once in a while,
hackers recognised another of their kind. Strange connections to
strange places in the middle of the night. Inconsistencies in process
names and sizes. The clues were visible for those who knew how to find
them.</p>

<p id="id02876" class="calibre1">The two hackers danced around each other, trying to determine who the
other was without giving away too much information. Finally the
mystery hacker asked Anthrax, `Are you a disease which affects sheep?'</p>

<p id="id02877" class="calibre1">Anthrax typed the simple answer back. `Yes.'</p>

<p id="id02878" class="calibre1">The other hacker revealed himself as Prime Suspect, one of the<br class="calibre4"/>

International Subversives. Anthrax recognised the name. He had seen<br class="calibre4"/>

Prime Suspect around on the BBSes, had read his postings. Before<br class="calibre4"/>

Anthrax could get started on a friendly chat, the IS hacker jumped in<br class="calibre4"/>

with an urgent warning.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02879" class="calibre1">He had unearthed emails showing the Feds were closing in on Anthrax.
The mail, obtained from system admins at Miden Pacific, described the
systems Anthrax had been visiting. It showed the phone connections he
had been using to get to them, some of which Telecom had traced back
to his phone. One of the admins had written, `We're on to him. I feel
really bad. He's seventeen years old and they are going to bust him
and ruin his life.' Anthrax felt a cold chill run down his spine.</p>

<p id="id02880" class="calibre1">Prime Suspect continued with the story. When he first came across the
email, he thought it referred to himself. The two hackers were the
same age and had evidently been breaking into the same systems. Prime
Suspect had freaked out over the mail. He took it back to the other
two IS hackers, and they talked it through. Most of the description
fitted, but a few of the details didn't seem to make sense. Prime
Suspect wasn't calling from a country exchange. The more they worked
it through, the clearer it became that the email must have been
referring to someone else. They ran through the list of other options
and Anthrax's name came up as a possibility. The IS hackers had all
seen him around a few systems and BBSes. Trax had even spoken to him
once on a conference call with another phreaker. They pieced together
what they knew of him and the picture fitted. The AFP were onto
Anthrax and they seemed to know a lot about him. They had traced his
telephone connection back to his house. They knew his age, which
implied they knew his name. The phone bills were in his parents'
names, so there may have been some personal surveillance of him. The
Feds were so close they were all but treading on his heels. The IS
hackers had been keeping an eye out for him, to warn him, but this was
the first time they had found him.</p>

<p id="id02881" class="calibre1">Anthrax thanked Prime Suspect and got out of the system. He sat frozen
in the night stillness. It was one thing to contemplate getting caught,
to carry mixed emotions on the hypothetical situation. It was another to
have the real prospect staring you in the face. In the morning, he
gathered up all his hacking papers, notes, manuals—everything. Three
trunks' worth of material. He carried it all to the back garden, lit a
bonfire and watched it burn. He vowed to give up hacking forever.</p>

<p id="id02882" class="calibre1">And he did give it up, for a time. But a few months later he somehow
found himself back in front of his computer screen, with his modem
purring. It was so tempting, so hard to let go. The police had never
shown up. Months had come and gone, still nothing. Prime Suspect must
have been wrong. Perhaps the AFP were after another hacker entirely.</p>

<p id="id02883" class="calibre1">Then, in October 1991, the AFP busted Prime Suspect, Mendax and Trax.
But Anthrax continued to hack, mostly on his own as usual, for another
two years. He reminded himself that the IS hackers worked in a team.
If the police hadn't nailed him when they busted the others, surely
they would never find him now. Further, he had become more skilled as
a hacker, better at covering his tracks, less likely to draw attention
to himself. He had other rationalisations too. The town where he lived
was so far away, the police would never bother travelling all the way
into the bush. The elusive Anthrax would remain at large forever, the
unvanquished Ned Kelly of the computer underground.</p>

<p id="id02884" class="calibre2">Mundane matters were on Anthrax's mind on the morning of 14 July 1994.
The removalists were due to arrive to take things from the half-empty
apartment he had shared with another student. His room-mate had
already departed and the place was a clutter of boxes stuffed with
clothes, tapes and books.</p>

<p id="id02885" class="calibre1">Anthrax sat in bed half-asleep, half-watching the `Today' show when he
heard the sound of a large vehicle pulling up outside. He looked out
the window expecting to see the removalists. What he saw instead was
at least four men in casual clothes running toward the house.</p>

<p id="id02886" class="calibre1">They were a little too enthusiastic for removalists and they split up
before getting to the door, with two men forking off toward opposite
sides of the building. One headed for the car port. Another dove
around the other side of the building. A third banged on the front
door. Anthrax shook himself awake.</p>

<p id="id02887" class="calibre1">The short, stocky guy at the front door was a worry. He had puffy,
longish hair and was wearing a sweatshirt and acid-wash jeans so tight
you could count the change in his back pocket. Bad ideas raced through
Anthrax's head. It looked like a home invasion. Thugs were going to
break into his home, tie him up and terrorise him before stealing all
his valuables.</p>

<p id="id02888" class="calibre1">`Open up. Open up,' the stocky one shouted, flashing a police badge.</p>

<p id="id02889" class="calibre1">Stunned, and still uncomprehending, Anthrax opened the door. `Do you
know who WE are?' the stocky one asked him.</p>

<p id="id02890" class="calibre1">Anthrax looked confused. No. Not sure.</p>

<p id="id02891" class="calibre1">`The Australian Federal Police.' The cop proceeded to read out the
search warrant.</p>

<p id="id02892" class="calibre1">What happened from this point forward is a matter of some debate. What
is fact is that the events of the raid and what
followed formed the basis of a formal complaint by Anthrax to the
Office of the Ombudsman and an internal investigation within the AFP.
The following is simply Anthrax's account of how it happened.</p>

<p id="id02893" class="calibre1">The stocky one barked at Anthrax, `Where's your computer?'</p>

<p id="id02894" class="calibre1">`What computer?' Anthrax looked blankly at the officer. He didn't have
a computer at his apartment. He used the uni's machines or friend's
computers.</p>

<p id="id02895" class="calibre1">`Your computer. Where is it? Which one of your friends has it?'</p>

<p id="id02896" class="calibre1">`No-one has it. I don't own one.'</p>

<p id="id02897" class="calibre1">`Well, when you decide to tell us where it is, you let us know.'</p>

<p id="id02898" class="calibre1">Yeah. Right. If Anthrax did have a hidden computer at uni, revealing
its location wasn't top of the must-do list.</p>

<p id="id02899" class="calibre1">The police pawed through his personal letters, quizzed Anthrax about
them. Who wrote this letter? Is he in the computer underground? What's
his address?</p>

<p id="id02900" class="calibre1">Anthrax said `no comment' more times than he could count. He saw a few
police moving into his bedroom and decided it was time to watch them
closely, make sure nothing was planted. He stood up to follow them in
and observe the search when one of the cops stopped him. Anthrax told
them he wanted a lawyer. One of the police looked on with disapproval.</p>

<p id="id02901" class="calibre1">`You must be guilty,' he told Anthrax. `Only guilty people ask for
lawyers. And here I was feeling sorry for you.'</p>

<p id="id02902" class="calibre1">Then one of the other officers dropped the bomb. `You know,' he began
casually, `we're also raiding your parents' house …'</p>

<p id="id02903" class="calibre1">Anthrax freaked out. His mum would be hysterical. He asked to call his
mother on his mobile, the only phone then working in the apartment.
The police refused to let him touch his mobile. Then he asked to call
her from the pay phone across the street. The police refused again.
One of the officers, a tall, lanky cop, recognised a leverage point if
ever he saw one. He spread the guilt on thick.</p>

<p id="id02904" class="calibre1">`Your poor sick mum. How could you do this to your poor sick mum?
We're going to have to take her to Melbourne for questioning, maybe
even to charge her, arrest her, take her to jail. You make me sick. I
feel sorry for a mother having a son like you who is going to cause
her all this trouble.'</p>

<p id="id02905" class="calibre1">From that moment on, the tall officer took every opportunity to talk
about Anthrax's `poor sick mum'. He wouldn't let up. Not that he
probably knew the first thing about scleroderma, the creeping fatal
disease which affected her. Anthrax often thought about the pain his
mother was in as the disease worked its way from her extremities to
her internal organs. Scleroderma toughened the skin on the fingers and
feet, but made them overly sensitive, particularly to changes in
weather. It typically affected women native to hot climates who moved
to colder environments.</p>

<p id="id02906" class="calibre1">Anthrax's mobile rang. His mother. It had to be. The police wouldn't
let him answer it.</p>

<p id="id02907" class="calibre1">The tall officer picked up the call, then turned to the stocky cop and
said in a mocking Indian accent, `It is some woman with an Indian
accent'. Anthrax felt like jumping out of his chair and grabbing the
phone. He felt like doing some other things too, things that would
have undoubtedly landed him in prison then and there.</p>

<p id="id02908" class="calibre1">The stocky cop nodded to the tall one, who handed the mobile to<br class="calibre4"/>

Anthrax.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02909" class="calibre1">At first, he couldn't make sense of what his mother was saying. She
was a terrified mess. Anthrax tried to calm her down. Then she tried
to comfort him.</p>

<p id="id02910" class="calibre1">`Don't worry. It will be all right,' she said it, over and over. No
matter what Anthrax said, she repeated that phrase, like a chant. In
trying to console him, she was actually calming herself. Anthrax
listened to her trying to impose order on the chaos around her. He
could hear noises in the background and he guessed it was the police
rummaging through her home. Suddenly, she said she had to go and hung
up.</p>

<p id="id02911" class="calibre1">Anthrax handed the phone back to the police and sat with his head in
his hands. What a wretched situation. He couldn't believe this was
happening to him. How could the police seriously consider taking his
mother to Melbourne for questioning? True, he phreaked from her home
office phone, but she had no idea how to hack or phreak. As for
charging his mother, that would just about kill her. In her mental and
physical condition, she would simply collapse, maybe never to get up
again.</p>

<p id="id02912" class="calibre1">He didn't have many options. One of the cops was sealing up his mobile
phone in a clear plastic bag and labelling it. It was physically
impossible for him to call a lawyer, since the police wouldn't let him
use the mobile or go to a pay phone. They harangued him about coming
to Melbourne for a police interview.</p>

<p id="id02913" class="calibre1">`It is your best interest to cooperate,' one of the cops told him. `It
would be in your best interest to come with us now.'</p>

<p id="id02914" class="calibre1">Anthrax pondered that line for a moment, considered how ludicrous it
sounded coming from a cop. Such a bald-faced lie told so
matter-of-factly. It would have been humorous if the situation with
his mother hadn't been so awful. He agreed to an interview with the
police, but it would have to be done on another day.</p>

<p id="id02915" class="calibre1">The cops wanted to search his car. Anthrax didn't like it, but there
was nothing incriminating in the car anyway. As he walked outside in
the winter morning, one of the cops looked down at Anthrax's feet,
which were bare in accordance with the Muslim custom of removing shoes
in the house. The cop asked if he was cold.</p>

<p id="id02916" class="calibre1">The other cop answered for Anthrax. `No. The fungus keeps them warm.'</p>

<p id="id02917" class="calibre1">Anthrax swallowed his anger. He was used to racism, and plenty of it,
especially from cops. But this was over the top.</p>

<p id="id02918" class="calibre1">In the town where he attended uni, everyone thought he was Aboriginal.<br class="calibre4"/>

There were only two races in that country town—white and Aboriginal.<br class="calibre4"/>

Indian, Pakistani, Malay, Burmese, Sri Lankan—it didn't matter. They<br class="calibre4"/>

were all Aboriginal, and were treated accordingly.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02919" class="calibre1">Once when he was talking on the pay phone across from his house, the
police pulled up and asked him what he was doing there. Talking on the
phone, he told them. It was pretty obvious. They asked for
identification, made him empty his pockets, which contained his small
mobile phone. They told him his mobile must be stolen, took it from
him and ran a check on the serial number. Fifteen minutes and many
more accusations later, they finally let him go with the flimsiest of
apologies. `Well, you understand,' one cop said. `We don't see many of
your type around here.'</p>

<p id="id02920" class="calibre1">Yeah. Anthrax understood. It looked pretty suspicious, a dark-skinned
boy using a public telephone. Very suss indeed.</p>

<p id="id02921" class="calibre1">In fact, Anthrax had the last laugh. He had been on a phreaked call to
Canada at the time and he hadn't bothered to hang up when the cops
arrived. Just told the other phreakers to hang on. After the police
left, he picked up the conversation where he left off.</p>

<p id="id02922" class="calibre1">Incidents like that taught him that sometimes the better path was to
toy with the cops. Let them play their little games. Pretend to be
manipulated by them. Laugh at them silently and give them nothing. So
he appeared to ignore the fungus comment and led the cops to his car.
They found nothing.</p>

<p id="id02923" class="calibre1">When the police finally packed up to leave, one of them handed Anthrax
a business card with the AFP's phone number.</p>

<p id="id02924" class="calibre1">`Call us to arrange an interview time,' he said.</p>

<p id="id02925" class="calibre1">`Sure,' Anthrax replied as he shut the door.</p>

<p id="id02926" class="calibre2">Anthrax keep putting the police off. Every time they called hassling
him for an interview, he said he was busy. But when they began ringing
up his mum, he found himself in a quandary. They were threatening and
yet reassuring to his mother all at the same time and spoke politely
to her, even apologetically.</p>

<p id="id02927" class="calibre1">`As bad as it sounds,' one of them said, `we're going to have to
charge you with things Anthrax has done, hacking, phreaking, etc. if
he doesn't cooperate with us. We know it sounds funny, but we're
within our rights to do that. In fact that is what the law dictates
because the phone is in your name.'</p>

<p id="id02928" class="calibre1">He followed this with the well-worn `it's in your son's best interest
to cooperate' line, delivered with cooing persuasion.</p>

<p id="id02929" class="calibre1">Anthrax wondered why there was no mention of charging his father,
whose name appeared on the house's main telephone number. That line
also carried some illegal calls.</p>

<p id="id02930" class="calibre1">His mother worried. She asked her son to cooperate with the police.
Anthrax felt he had to protect his mother and finally agreed to a
police interview after his uni exams. The only reason he did so was
because of the police threat to charge his mother. He was sure that if
they dragged his mother through court, her health would deteriorate
and lead to an early death.</p>

<p id="id02931" class="calibre1">Anthrax's father picked him up from uni on a fine November day and
drove down to Melbourne. His mother had insisted that he attend the
interview, since he knew all about the law and police. Anthrax didn't
mind having him along: he figured a witness might prevent any use of
police muscle.</p>

<p id="id02932" class="calibre1">During the ride to the city, Anthrax talked about how he would handle
the interview. The good news was that the AFP had said they wanted to
interview him about his phreaking, not his hacking. He went to the
interview understanding they would only be discussing his `recent
stuff'—the phreaking. He had two possible approaches to the
interview. He could come clean and admit everything, as his first
lawyer had advised. Or he could pretend to cooperate and be evasive,
which was what his instincts told him to do.</p>

<p id="id02933" class="calibre1">His father jumped all over the second option. `You have to cooperate
fully. They will know if you are lying. They are trained to pick out
lies. Tell them everything and they will go easier on you.' Law and
order all the way.</p>

<p id="id02934" class="calibre1">`Who do they think they are anyway? The pigs.' Anthrax looked away,
disgusted at the thought of police harassing people like his mother.</p>

<p id="id02935" class="calibre1">`Don't call them pigs,' his father snapped. `They are police officers.
If you are ever in trouble, they are the first people you are ever
going to call.'</p>

<p id="id02936" class="calibre1">`Oh yeah. What kind of trouble am I going to be in that the first
people I call are the AFP?' Anthrax replied.</p>

<p id="id02937" class="calibre1">Anthrax would put up with his father coming along so long as he kept
his mouth shut during the interview. He certainly wasn't there for
personal support. They had a distant relationship at best. When his
father began working in the town where Anthrax now lived and studied,
his mother had tried to patch things between them. She suggested his
father take Anthrax out for dinner once a week, to smooth things over.
Develop a relationship. They had dinner a handful of times and Anthrax
listened to his father's lectures. Admit you were wrong. Cooperate
with the police. Get your life together. Own up to it all. Grow up. Be
responsible. Stop being so useless. Stop being so stupid.</p>

<p id="id02938" class="calibre1">The lectures were a bit rich, Anthrax thought, considering that his
father had benefited from Anthrax's hacking skills. When he discovered
Anthrax had got into a huge news clipping database, he asked the boy
to pull up every article containing the word `prison'. Then he had him
search for articles on discipline. The searches should have cost a
fortune, probably thousands of dollars. But his father didn't pay a
cent, thanks to Anthrax. And he didn't spend much time lecturing
Anthrax on the evils of hacking then.</p>

<p id="id02939" class="calibre1">When they arrived at AFP headquarters, Anthrax made a point of putting
his feet up on the leather couch in the reception area and opened a
can of Coke he had brought along. His father got upset.</p>

<p id="id02940" class="calibre1">`Get your feet off that seat. You shouldn't have brought that can of<br class="calibre4"/>

Coke. It doesn't look very professional.'<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02941" class="calibre1">`Hey, I'm not going for a job interview here,' Anthrax responded.</p>

<p id="id02942" class="calibre1">Constable Andrew Sexton, a redhead sporting two earrings, came up to<br class="calibre4"/>

Anthrax and his father and took them upstairs for coffee. Detective<br class="calibre4"/>

Sergeant Ken Day, head of the Computer Crime Unit, was in a meeting,<br class="calibre4"/>

Sexton said, so the interview would be delayed a little.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02943" class="calibre1">Anthrax's father and Sexton found they shared some interests in law
enforcement. They discussed the problems associated with
rehabilitation and prisoner discipline. Joked with each other.
Laughed. Talked about `young Anthrax'. Young Anthrax did this. Young
Anthrax did that.</p>

<p id="id02944" class="calibre1">Young Anthrax felt sick. Watching his own father cosying up to the
enemy, talking as if he wasn't even there.</p>

<p id="id02945" class="calibre1">When Sexton went to check on whether Day had finished his meeting,
Anthrax's father growled, `Wipe that look of contempt off your face,
young man. You are going to get nowhere in this world if you show that
kind of attitude, they are going to come down on you like a ton of
bricks.'</p>

<p id="id02946" class="calibre1">Anthrax didn't know what to say. Why should he treat these people with
any respect after the way they threatened his mother?</p>

<p id="id02947" class="calibre1">The interview room was small but very full. A dozen or more boxes, all
filled with labelled print-outs.</p>

<p id="id02948" class="calibre1">Sexton began the interview. `Taped record of interview conducted at
Australian Federal Police Headquarters, 383 Latrobe Street Melbourne
on 29 November 1994.' He reeled off the names of the people present
and asked each to introduce himself for voice recognition.</p>

<p id="id02949" class="calibre1">`As I have already stated, Detective Sergeant Day and I are making
enquiries into your alleged involvement into the manipulation of
private automated branch exchanges [PABXes] via Telecom 008 numbers in
order to obtain free phone calls nationally and internationally. Do
you clearly understand this allegation?'</p>

<p id="id02950" class="calibre1">`Yes.'</p>

<p id="id02951" class="calibre1">Sexton continued with the necessary, and important, preliminaries. Did
Anthrax understand that he was not obliged to answer any questions?
That he had the right to communicate with a lawyer? That he had
attended the interview of his own free will? That he was free to leave
at any time?</p>

<p id="id02952" class="calibre1">Yes, Anthrax said in answer to each question.</p>

<p id="id02953" class="calibre1">Sexton then ploughed through a few more standard procedures before he
finally got to the meat of the issue—telephones. He fished around in
one of the many boxes and pulled out a mobile phone. Anthrax confirmed
that it was his phone.</p>

<p id="id02954" class="calibre1">`Was that the phone that you used to call the 008 numbers and
subsequent connections?' Sexton asked.</p>

<p id="id02955" class="calibre1">`Yes.'</p>

<p id="id02956" class="calibre1">`Contained in that phone is a number of pre-set numbers. Do you
agree?'</p>

<p id="id02957" class="calibre1">`Yes.'</p>

<p id="id02958" class="calibre1">`I went to the trouble of extracting those records from it.' Sexton
looked pleased with himself for hacking Anthrax's speed-dial numbers
from the mobile. `Number 22 is of some interest to myself. It comes up
as Aaron. Could that be the person you referred to before as Aaron in
South Australia?'</p>

<p id="id02959" class="calibre1">`Yes, but he is always moving house. He is a hard person to track
down.'</p>

<p id="id02960" class="calibre1">Sexton went through a few more numbers, most of which Anthrax hedged.<br class="calibre4"/>

He asked Anthrax questions about his manipulation of the phone system,<br class="calibre4"/>

particularly about the way he made free calls overseas using<br class="calibre4"/>

Australian companies' 008 numbers.<br class="calibre4"/>
</p>

<p id="id02961" class="calibre1">When Anthrax had patiently explained how it all worked, Sexton went
through some more speed-dial numbers.</p>

<p id="id02962" class="calibre1">`Number 43. Do you recognise that one?'</p>

<p id="id02963" class="calibre1">`That's the Swedish Party Line.'</p>

<p id="id02964" class="calibre1">`What about these other numbers? Such as 78? And 30?'</p>

<p id="id02965" class="calibre1">`I'm not sure. I couldn't say what any of these are. It's been so
long,' Anthrax paused, sensing the pressure from the other side of the
table. `These ones here, they are numbers in my town. But I don't know
who. Very often, 'cause I don't have any pen and paper with me, I just
plug a number into the phone.'</p>

<p id="id02966" class="calibre1">Sexton looked unhappy. He decided to go in a little harder. `I'm going
to be pretty blunt. So far you have admitted to the 008s but I think
you are understating your knowledge and your experience when it comes
to these sort of offences.' He caught himself. `Not offences. But your
involvement in all of this … I think you have got a little bit more
… I'm not saying you are lying, don't get me wrong, but you tend to
be pulling yourself away from how far you were really into this. And
how far everyone looked up to you.'</p>

<p id="id02967" class="calibre1">There was the gauntlet, thrown down on the table. Anthrax picked it
up.</p>

<p id="id02968" class="calibre1">`They looked up to me? That was just a perception. To be honest, I
don't know that much. I couldn't tell you anything about telephone
exchanges or anything like that. In the past, I guess the reason they
might look up to me in the sense of a leader is because I was doing
this, as you are probably aware, quite a bit in the past, and
subsequently built up a reputation. Since then I decided I wouldn't do
it again.'</p>
