<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">The	competition	could	save	her	life…</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">But	only	if	she	wins. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 can	 manipulate	 the	 elements	 with	 ease;	 water,	 air,	 earth,	 and	 fire	 all bend	to	her	will.	As	a	citizen	of	the	Storm—a	crime-laden	land	where	death	is the	only	constant—her	only	chance	for	a	better	life	is	to	become	Master	Shaper. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">A	competition	for	the	position	takes	place	at	the	end	of	her	training	years.	If she	 wins,	 she	 would	 live	 in	 the	 palace,	 work	 for	 the	 emperor,	 and	 escape	 her inevitable	death	in	the	Storm.	But	she’s	not	the	only	one	with	a	chance	to	win. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Aaden	 is	 another	 talented	 student.	 As	 a	 citizen	 of	 the	 Crown,	 he	 was	 born with	unlimited	privilege	and	resources.	When	someone	from	the	Crown	wants	to win,	 they	 do.	 End	 of	 story.	 And	 his	 shaping	 is	 unlike	 anything	 Talise	 has	 ever seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Complicating	 matters,	 Talise’s	 loved	 one	 in	 the	 Storm	 gives	 her	 reason	 to abandon	the	competition	altogether,	forcing	her	to	make	an	impossible	choice. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>

<p class="calibre1">IT	WAS	AN	HONOR	TO	TRAIN	AT	the	academy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 recited	 the	 words	 to	 herself	 over	 and	 over	 again	 as	 she	 stood	 stiff-backed	 in	 the	 crowded	 deck	 of	 the	 riverboat.	 If	 chosen,	 she’d	 be	 ripped	 away from	the	home	and	family	she	loved.	She’d	leave	behind	the	life	she	knew.	All	to train	at	the	academy.	An	honor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	didn’t	seem	so	great	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	stuffy,	humid	heat	hung	thick	in	the	air	of	the	lowest	deck.	The	lowest	deck had	 no	 windows,	 offering	 no	 sunlight	 and	 no	 view	 of	 the	 river	 to	 help	 with seasickness.	 Two	 small	 lanterns	 hung	 from	 the	 ceiling,	 each	 giving	 off	 a flickering	 glow.	 Whenever	 the	 boat	 jostled,	 several	 people	 were	 thrown	 off balance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marmie	gripped	Talise	by	the	shoulders,	tucking	her	into	the	corner	where	no one	could	hurt	her.	The	top	of	Talise’s	head	only	barely	reached	Marmie’s	elbow, which	meant	she	couldn’t	do	much	to	free	herself	from	the	corner.	Instead,	she folded	her	arms	over	her	chest	and	pouted.	They’d	been	saving	for	this	trip	for months.	 Two	 years	 really.	 They	 had	 always	 known	 it	 would	 lead	 here.	 She always	imagined	it	would	be	less	stuffy	and	more	exciting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	 people	 from	 the	 outer	 ring	 of	 the	 continent—or	 the	 Storm	 as	 it	 was usually	 called—couldn’t	 shape.	 Talise	 had	 the	 ability	 to	 mold	 and	 manipulate elements	while	most	of	her	neighbors	in	the	Storm	could	only	worry	about	their next	meal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	academy	would	be	safer	than	her	harrowing	and	vicious	life	in	the	outer ring.	She	never	wanted	to	live	in	the	Storm,	but	she	didn’t	like	the	idea	of	being away	from	Marmie	either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Almost	there,”	Marmie	said,	her	voice	like	honey	and	sparkles.	She	looked down	 at	 Talise	 and	 gave	 her	 a	 smile	 that	 was	 meant	 to	 ease	 fears.	 It	 helped	 a little	but	not	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Especially	 because	 the	 riverboat	 jostled	 again,	 and	 a	 heavy-set	 man	 lost	 his balance,	 nearly	 toppling	 Marmie	 to	 the	 ground.	 Talise	 let	 herself	 be	 tucked behind	Marmie’s	skirts	after	that.	This	time	with	no	complaint. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 didn’t	 understand	 why	 they	 had	 to	 ride	 in	 the	 lowest	 deck	 at	 all	 when both	 the	 higher	 decks	 had	 plenty	 of	 room.	 At	 least	 up	 there	 she	 could	 feel	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>misty	breeze	on	her	face	and	smell	the	wet	soil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Truthfully,	she	did	know	why	they	stood	in	the	lowest	deck.	It	was	the	same reason	they	didn’t	have	enough	food	and	couldn’t	learn	to	read.	They	were	from the	 Storm.	 They	 were	 the	 lowliest	 members	 of	 the	 continent	 of	 Kamdaria: criminals,	thieves,	murderers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	 people	 were	 sent	 to	 the	 Storm,	 they	 never	 left.	 Even	 if	 the	 original crimes	 had	 been	 committed	 ten	 generations	 earlier,	 people	 still	 never	 left	 the Storm.	They	never	left	because	life	in	the	Storm	required	crime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	required	stealing	from	trade	wagons	just	so	there	would	be	a	slice	of	bread for	dinner.	It	required	threatening	guards	so	they	wouldn’t	torment	a	neighbor.	It required	saving	rainwater	just	so	there	would	be	something	to	drink	after	a	day of	labor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why	it	was	illegal	to	save	rainwater	didn’t	make	any	sense	to	Talise.	No	one from	 the	 Storm	 could	 shape	 the	 water,	 so	 it	 was	 far	 from	 dangerous.	 It	 just seemed	like	another	way	to	control	the	people.	Another	way	to	force	people	to commit	 crimes,	 which	 then	 forced	 them	 to	 stay	 in	 the	 Storm.	 Where	 they belonged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People	 never	 left	 the	 Storm.	 Never.	 Especially	 not	 children	 who	 were	 seven years	old. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unless	they	got	into	the	academy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 sighed.	 Marmie	 had	 been	 saying	 they	 were	 almost	 there	 for	 the	 last twenty	minutes.	Maybe	she’d	be	right	at	some	point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 toddler’s	 sharp	 shriek	 broke	 through	 humid	 air	 of	 the	 deck.	 The	 mother looked	 mortified	 as	 she	 tried	 to	 appease	 her	 child	 with	 promises	 of	 what	 they would	 see	 when	 the	 riverboat	 stopped.	 Cherry	 tree	 blossoms	 and	 green-tiled buildings.	 Fresh	 air	 and	 gravel	 on	 the	 streets.	 Only	 small	 glimpses	 of	 mud instead	of	big	mounds	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	toddler	didn’t	find	any	of	these	satisfactory.	The	heavy-set	man	gave	the mother	 a	 hard	 glance,	 and	 he	 wasn’t	 the	 only	 one.	 Everyone	 shifted	 to	 move away	from	the	child,	but	that	only	made	him	more	upset.	One	man	put	his	palms over	his	ears	looking	pointedly	at	the	mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	Terreth.  <i class="calibre3">Please</i>,”	the	mother	begged.	“We	are	almost	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 child	 looked	 more	 terrified	 by	 the	 minute	 as	 the	 bodies	 around	 him became	 angrier.	 His	 shrieking	 bounced	 from	 wall	 to	 wall	 while	 his	 little	 eyes filled	with	a	well	of	tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Talise	watched	the	child,	she	tried	to	think	of	a	way	to	help.	Not	for	the sake	 of	 the	 other	 passengers.	 They	 could	 jump	 into	 the	 river	 for	 all	 she	 cared. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>But	the	child	looked	so	frightened.	He	needed	a	distraction.	Something	fun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 lowered	 her	 body	 until	 her	 hand	 hovered	 just	 above	 the	 floor	 of	 the deck.	 She’d	 been	 practicing	 hard,	 but	 even	 a	 little	 shaping	 still	 required	 her absolute	attention.	With	narrowed	eyes	and	a	clenched	jaw,	she	willed	the	dirt	on the	floor	to	rise	into	the	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 took	 a	 minute,	 but	 soon,	 little	 dust	 particles	 rose	 up	 in	 a	 cloud.	 She clenched	her	jaw	tighter.	A	cloud	wouldn’t	do	her	any	good.	She	needed	enough dirt	 to	 make	 something	 the	 boy	 could	 see	 easily	 in	 the	 flickering	 light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	he	couldn’t	miss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 narrowed	 her	 eyes	 even	 more.	 Her	 stomach	 tightened	 with	 anticipation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	a	solid	clump	of	dirt	broke	apart,	and	the	little	dirt	pieces	flew	up	toward her	hand.	Now	she	had	something	she	could	work	with. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking	a	tentative	step	out	from	Marmie’s	skirts,	Talise	shaped	the	dirt	so	it would	 hover	 above	 her	 palm.	 She	 turned	 her	 back	 to	 the	 other	 passengers	 and bounced	her	eyebrows	up	and	down	until	she	caught	the	boy’s	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	finally	looked	at	her,	he	was	still	shrieking.	She	gave	him	a	crooked smile	and	looked	down	at	the	hovering	dirt.	Then,	she	bounced	the	dirt	until	it hovered	as	high	as	her	head	before	it	fell	back	down	only	a	few	inches	above	her palm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 sour	 expression	 on	 the	 boy’s	 face	 hadn’t	 relaxed,	 but	 the	 volume	 of	 his shrieking	 had	 lowered.	 She	 did	 it	 again.	 This	 time	 she	 wore	 an	 expression	 of surprise	as	if	the	dirt	bounced	of	its	own	accord,	and	she	hadn’t	shaped	it	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 boy	 quieted	 mid-shriek	 as	 his	 eyes	 opened	 wide.	 Now	 that	 she	 had	 his full	attention,	she	shaped	the	dirt	until	it	formed	a	long	line.	It	didn’t	look	much like	the	snake	she	was	going	for,	but	it	was	close	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	to	pull	her	stomach	muscles	in	tight	as	she	moved	the	line	of	dirt	to look	like	a	snake	slithering.	Again,	it	didn’t	look	as	neat	as	she	wanted,	but	this was	 probably	 the	 first	 time	 in	 his	 life	 the	 boy	 had	 seen	 a	 citizen	 of	 the	 Storm shaping.	He	was	more	than	mesmerized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	the	snake,	Talise	tried	a	bird.	Her	epic	failure	of	that	produced	a	giggle from	the	boy,	who	then	clapped	his	hands	and	said,	“More!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	she	could	think	of	something	else	to	make,	the	riverboat	floated	to	a stop.	 Talise	 made	 the	 clump	 of	 dirt	 bounce	 a	 few	 more	 times	 while	 the	 other passengers	 unloaded.	 When	 no	 one	 was	 left	 in	 the	 lowest	 deck	 besides	 her, Marmie,	the	boy,	and	his	mother,	Talise	finally	let	the	dirt	fall	to	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	 you,”	 the	 mother	 said,	 lowering	 her	 head	 so	 she	 could	 be	 eye	 level with	Talise. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>After	Marmie	poked	her	in	the	back,	Talise	remembered	to	respect	her	elder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lowering	her	head	in	a	short	bow,	she	said,	“You’re	welcome,	ma’am,	but	it	was nothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	going	to	be	tested	for	the	academy?”	the	woman	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 Talise	 nodded,	 the	 woman	 gave	 a	 smile	 so	 genuine	 it	 didn’t	 seem possible	 for	 someone	 from	 the	 Storm.	 She	 wiped	 a	 bead	 of	 sweat	 off	 her forehead,	leaving	behind	a	short	streak	of	dirt.	“A	shaper	from	the	Storm,”	she said,	shaking	her	head	with	disbelief.	“I	never	could	have	dreamed	of	something so	wild.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marmie	 nodded	 to	 the	 woman	 and	 started	 nudging	 Talise	 forward.	 “Come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	testing	begins	soon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait,”	the	woman	said.	“I	just	wanted	to	say	how	special	you	are.	You	made my	 son	 laugh	 when	 everyone	 else	 just	 scowled.	 And	 you’re	 a	 shaper	 from	 the Storm.	You’ll	change	Kamdaria	for	the	better,	my	dear.	I’m	sure	of	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">TWO</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">TALISE’S	 HEAD	 BOUNCED	 RIGHT	 TO	 LEFT	 AS	 she	 tried	 to	 soak	 up	 her surroundings.	 They	 had	 arrived	 in	 the	 middle	 ring	 of	 Kamdaria—better	 known as	the	Gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	streets	were	gravel	just	like	the	woman	on	the	riverboat	said	they	would be.	 There	 were	 no	 clouds	 of	 dust	 as	 people	 jogged	 past.	 A	 few	 people	 pulled wagons,	 but	 many	 of	 them	 had	 horses.	 Horses!	 Every	 so	 often,	 a	 stagecoach would	fly	past,	and	Talise’s	mouth	would	drop	all	over	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	stores	looked	bigger	than	they	did	in	the	Storm	as	well.	Shop	keepers	in the	 Storm	 were	 terrified	 of	 risk,	 so	 they	 only	 stocked	 the	 absolute	 necessities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes	 they	 didn’t	 even	 have	 those,	 which	 meant	 their	 stores	 were	 even tinier	 and	 emptier	 than	 the	 ones	 here	 in	 the	 Gate.	 These	 stores	 had	 all	 sorts	 of items. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	everything	was	so	clean.	Marmie	had	scrubbed	Talise’s	face	a	thousand</p>
<p class="calibre1">times	that	morning	and	brushed	her	hair	until	her	scalp	seemed	raw.	Now	Talise was	 grateful	 for	 the	 effort.	 She	 only	 wished	 her	 cotton	 dress	 were	 a	 little	 less weathered.	The	ugly	patch	near	her	hem	seemed	infinitely	brighter	in	this	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	least	it	was	clean. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	 the	 people	 seemed	 different.	 They	 didn’t	 look	 so	 worn.	 So	 tired.	 They looked	like	they	could	think	about	something	other	than	the	hunger	creeping	at them	from	every	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	man	bumped	into	Marmie	as	they	crossed	the	street.	He	looked	apologetic</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 first	 until	 he	 saw	 the	 state	 of	 their	 clothes.	 He	 bared	 his	 teeth	 as	 he	 jumped away	from	them.	A	sharp	intake	of	breath	went	through	his	teeth	like	a	hiss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 muttered	 under	 his	 breath,	 but	 the	 only	 word	 Talise	 could	 make	 out	 was <i class="calibre3">vermin</i>.	 Nobody	 liked	 people	 from	 the	 Storm.	 Even	 people	 in	 the	 Storm	 didn’t like	 people	 from	 the	 Storm.	 Now	 that	 they	 had	 traveled	 to	 the	 Gate,	 everyone shot	them	angry	glares	and	suspicious	glances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marmie	 seemed	 oblivious	 to	 the	 entire	 interaction.	 Her	 eyes	 were	 set	 on	 a nearby	 building	 with	 unpainted	 walls	 and	 a	 gabled	 roof	 with	 cypress	 bark shingles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 they	 arrived,	 Talise	 was	 ordered	 to	 sit	 on	 a	 nearby	 bench	 outside	 the building	while	Marmie	went	in	and	did	the	paperwork.	Not	that	Talise	minded. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>She	was	too	busy	soaking	in	more	of	the	Gate.	They	weren’t	even	in	the	inner circle	 of	 Kamdaria—also	 called	 the	 Crown—but	 everything	 already	 seemed	 a thousand	 times	 better	 than	 the	 Storm.	 There	 was	 so	 much	 water,	 so	 much vegetation,	so	much	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	eyes	wandered	when	the	sound	of	a	wooden	hammer	rippled	through	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">air.	She	took	a	few	steps	down	the	cobblestone	path	until	she	could	see	inside	a courtyard	that	stood	next	to	the	building	where	Marmie	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 recognized	 the	 scene	 at	 once,	 even	 though	 she	 had	 never	 seen	 anything like	it	in	the	Storm.	A	wooden	podium	stood	at	the	back	of	the	courtyard	with	an orange	 tree	 on	 the	 right	 and	 a	 cherry	 tree	 on	 the	 left.	 A	 man	 stood	 behind	 the podium	 wearing	 a	 red	 silk	 hat	 with	 a	 ball	 and	 tassel	 at	 the	 top.	 A	 judge.	 A woman	sat	on	a	chair	next	to	the	podium. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	a	trial.	But	not	a	regular	trial,	a	card-marking	trial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 judge	 had	 two	 stamps	 on	 the	 wooden	 podium	 in	 front	 of	 him.	 Talise knew	one	of	the	stamps	would	be	of	a	silver	crescent	moon	and	one	would	be	a black	 <i class="calibre3">X</i>.	Judging	by	the	woman’s	face,	the	moon	stamp	wouldn’t	be	used	today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	clawed	at	her	tunic	hem	as	she	chewed	her	bottom	lip.	She	kept</p>
<p class="calibre1">nodding	and	shaking	her	head	in	answer	to	someone’s	questions.	Talise	was	too far	away	to	hear	the	questions,	and	she	couldn’t	even	tell	who	was	talking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	began	gulping	and	didn’t	seem	to	notice	when	her	chewing	teeth</p>
<p class="calibre1">drew	blood	from	her	lips.	All	at	once,	she	let	out	a	gasp	and	her	hands	flew	over her	open	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Guilty!”	The	judge’s	booming	voice	erupted	through	the	courtyard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jumping	to	her	feet,	the	woman	screamed,	“NO!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 judge	 sneered	 at	 her	 and	 glanced	 toward	 a	 wooden	 platform	 where	 a dozen	 people	 sat.	 The	 woman’s	 family.	 It	 seemed	 the	 woman	 had	 five generations	 with	 her.	 Talise	 picked	 out	 a	 couple	 who	 must	 have	 been	 the woman’s	 parents.	 Another	 man	 and	 woman	 who	 must	 have	 been	 grandparents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	also	a	few	people	the	woman’s	age,	probably	her	siblings.	And	then, three	adults	who	must	have	been	the	woman’s	children. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 son	 and	 his	 wife	 and	 then	 a	 daughter	 who	 looked	 barely	 eighteen.	 Most concerning	of	all	was	the	baby,	quietly	sleeping	in	the	son’s	arms.	Since	ID	cards weren’t	 given	 out	 until	 a	 child	 turned	 eighteen,	 any	 of	 the	 woman’s	 children under	eighteen	wouldn’t	be	present. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ID	cards	out,”	the	judge	said,	pulling	one	of	the	stamps	off	the	podium.	He held	an	ink	pad	in	his	palm,	which	must	have	been	black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!”	 the	 woman	 shouted	 again.	 “Please	 don’t.	 Punish	 me.	 Punish	 me</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>instead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 judge	 turned	 on	 her	 as	 his	 eyebrows	 furrowed	 together.	 He	 spoke	 in	 a tight	voice	that	was	just	loud	enough	for	Talise	to	hear.	“You	dare	question	the laws	of	Kamdaria?”	he	asked.	“It	has	always	been	obvious	that	we	care	for	our children	 better	 than	 we	 care	 for	 ourselves.	 It	 is	 only	 fitting	 then,	 that	 our punishments	should	pass	to	our	children	as	well.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 they	 did	 nothing	 wrong.”	 The	 woman	 had	 lunged	 from	 her	 chair	 and reached	so	desperately	for	the	judge	that	two	guards	had	to	hold	her	back.	“My son’s	baby	is	just	a	newborn.	She	won’t	survive	winter	in	the	Storm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	judge	whirled	around	to	face	the	woman.	“Then	you	will	suffer	knowing</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	fate	awaits	them	and	knowing	your	actions	brought	them	there.	That	is	the greatest	punishment	there	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please,	 she’s	 just	 a	 baby.  <i class="calibre3">Please</i>.	 I	 beg	 you.”	 The	 woman’s	 face	 had	 been pressed	into	the	gravel	by	one	of	the	guards,	but	it	did	nothing	to	stop	the	words spewing	from	her	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 judge	 ignored	 the	 woman	 as	 he	 traipsed	 over	 to	 the	 wooden	 platform where	the	family	members	sat.	They	all	had	tears	streaming	down	their	cheeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	older	women	was	convulsing	as	her	body	shook	with	sobs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 none	 of	 them	 protested.	 They	 knew	 the	 laws	 of	 Kamdaria.	 The	 card system	 had	 been	 implemented	 centuries	 ago	 and	 since	 then,	 crime	 was	 almost non-existent	except	in	the	Storm.	People	could	hurt	themselves	easily,	but	no	one wanted	to	force	their	children	and	children’s	children	to	bear	a	punishment	they themselves	deserved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	perfect	system.	Supposedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 son	 clutched	 his	 baby	 closer	 as	 he	 held	 his	 ID	 card	 out	 to	 the	 judge.	 A look	 of	 resignation	 paired	 with	 his	 dwindling	 tears.	 His	 wife	 wore	 no resignation.	 Instead	 she	 buried	 her	 face	 in	 a	 handkerchief	 and	 couldn’t	 look	 as the	judge	stamped	her	card	with	a	black	X. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	barely	eighteen-year-old	daughter	had	eyes	so	wide	someone	could	walk</p>
<p class="calibre1">straight	through	her	irises.	She	gasped	when	the	judge	stamped	her	card,	as	if	it wasn’t	real	until	that	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	son,	his	wife,	and	the	daughter	all	had	their	ID	cards	marked,	the judge	 waved	 at	 a	 nearby	 guard.	 “Take	 them	 to	 the	 docks	 immediately.	 A riverboat	will	be	leaving	for	the	Storm	soon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now?”	 the	 son	 asked.	 He	 gripped	 his	 wife	 around	 the	 waist	 with	 one	 hand and	clutched	his	baby	to	his	chest	with	the	other.	“Don’t	we	get	to	say	goodbye to	our	friends?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>“No,”	the	judge	said	without	a	shred	of	sympathy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	our	things?”	the	wife	asked.	“We	need	the	baby’s	sleeping	mat</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	her	books.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Books?”	 The	 judge	 let	 out	 a	 laugh	 that	 shook	 through	 the	 courtyard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Children	 in	 the	 Storm	 are	 not	 taught	 how	 to	 read.	 You’ll	 get	 none	 of	 your things.	 You’ll	 start	 life	 the	 same	 as	 everyone	 who	 has	 been	 sent	 to	 the	 Storm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	nothing	but	the	clothes	on	your	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mama,”	 the	 eighteen-year-old	 girl	 called	 out.	 Her	 voice	 wobbled	 as	 reality seemed	to	hit	like	a	brick	on	her	vocal	cords. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	wife	began	trembling.	The	son	gripped	his	family	more	desperately,	but he	seemed	to	realize	his	grip	wouldn’t	save	anyone	from	anything	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	if	sensing	their	fear,	the	baby	let	out	cry.	When	his	family	only	sobbed	in response,	the	baby	cried	harder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Talise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	jumped	at	Marmie’s	quiet	voice.	“It’s	time	for	you	to	come	in	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marmie	spoke	in	a	whisper	with	her	eyes	on	the	family	that	was	in	the	midst of	falling	apart.	She	tugged	Talise	by	the	elbow,	not	taking	her	eyes	away	from the	 courtyard	 until	 they	 stood	 in	 front	 of	 the	 building	 where	 the	 testing	 would occur. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	 when	 Marmie	 touched	 the	 door	 handle,	 she	 turned	 to	 Talise	 with	 misty eyes.	Her	mouth	quivered,	but	Talise	already	knew	what	she	was	going	to	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,”	Talise	said.	She	tried	to	set	her	jaw	the	way	Marmie	did	when	she had	 won	 an	 argument.	 It	 made	 Marmie	 look	 powerful.	 Talise	 needed	 some	 of that	 power	 now	 because	 Marmie’s	 unspoken	 words	 were	 just	 as	 heavy	 as	 the scene	in	the	courtyard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unless	she	sought	an	early	death,	Talise	had	to	get	out	of	the	Storm.	Honor	or not,	the	academy	was	her	only	chance. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">THREE</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">THE	ROOM	SEEMED	TOO	HOT	FOR	THE	spring	air	outside.	Maybe	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">nerves	or	maybe	it	was	the	little	balls	of	fire	that	would	erupt	from	a	hand	every few	minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 woman	 guard	 in	 a	 yellow	 silk	 tunic	 and	 black	 belt	 ushered	 Talise	 and Marmie	into	a	corner	of	the	testing	room.	She	didn’t	say	it,	but	it	seemed	like	the woman	was	trying	to	hide	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Children	about	Talise’s	age	stood	in	different	parts	of	the	room.	One	girl	wore an	expression	coursing	with	excitement.	One	boy	kept	tapping	his	feet	together before	he	would	grab	his	mother	by	the	waist	and	give	her	the	world’s	shortest hug.	But	it	would	only	be	a	moment	before	he	did	it	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	girl	was	showing	off	for	some	of	the	other	children.	She	could	shape two	elements.	All	of	them	would	be	able	to	shape	all	four	elements	by	the	time they	finished	the	first	stage	at	the	academy,	but	for	now,	shaping	more	than	one element	 was	 impressive.	 The	 girl	 tucked	 her	 hair	 behind	 her	 ear	 before	 she moved	 a	 tiny	 pile	 of	 dirt	 and	 then	 blew	 off	 the	 top	 of	 it	 with	 air.	 The	 other children	clapped	in	delight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scanning	the	room,	Talise	guessed	she	was	one	of	the	youngest	children.	She was	only	seven	when	most	of	them	were	probably	eight.	She	was	probably	the thinnest	 too	 thanks	 to	 the	 Storm.	 If	 she	 weighed	 even	 a	 few	 pounds	 less,	 she would	lose	her	ability	to	shape.	She	had	lost	it	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marmie	 went	 three	 weeks	 eating	 nothing	 but	 lemon	 water	 and	 breadcrumbs so	 Talise	 could	 have	 the	 extra	 food.	 Even	 when	 the	 shaping	 returned,	 Marmie took	smaller	portions	so	Talise	could	have	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	guard	wearing	yellow	entered	from	the	back	room.	He	called	a	name</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	his	leather-bound	writing	pad.	Soon,	a	dark-haired	child	who	looked	a	full year	older	than	Talise	bounded	to	the	middle	of	the	room.	The	child	bowed	to	his elder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	yellow-clad	guard	pointed	to	a	pile	of	dirt.	“If	you	can	shape	earth,	please move	the	pile	to	the	spot	indicated.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dark-haired	child	shook	his	head	and	the	guard	made	a	note	in	his	writing pad.	Then	he	said,	“If	you	can	shape	water,	raise	the	water	from	this	bowl	and put	it	back	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>The	boy	shook	his	head	again	and	a	note	was	made. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 guard	 pointed	 to	 the	 red	 and	 black	 brocade	 curtains	 on	 the	 window behind	him.	“If	you	can	shape	air,	make	these	curtains	dance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	boy	nodded,	and	soon	the	curtains	were	fluttering	with	sharp	bursts	that indicated	shaping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 guard	 made	 another	 note	 in	 his	 writing	 pad	 before	 he	 said,	 “If	 you	 can shape	fire,	produce	a	small	ball	of	fire	above	your	palm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 boy	 shook	 his	 head,	 and	 the	 guard	 nodded	 as	 he	 made	 note	 in	 his	 pad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	the	guard	pointed	to	the	back	room.	“Off	you	go.	Say	your	goodbyes,	and don’t	forget	your	personal	effects.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	boy	bounced	over	to	his	parents	wearing	a	smile	that	must	have	hurt	his cheeks.	 His	 parents	 clapped	 and	 gave	 him	 so	 many	 kisses,	 his	 cheeks	 were probably	 wet.	 They	 strapped	 a	 large	 sack	 on	 his	 back	 that	 looked	 almost	 as heavy	as	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise’s	eyes	slowly	trailed	over	to	the	small	tote	bag	she	had	brought.	It	only had	 two	 dresses,	 some	 toiletry	 items,	 and	 a	 tiny	 pouch	 of	 money.	 When	 she scanned	the	rest	of	the	room,	her	tote	bag	looked	even	smaller. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Biting	her	bottom	lip,	Talise	sidled	up	to	Marmie	and	squeezed	her	hand.	“I don’t	want	to	go	to	the	academy	without	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,	love,”	Marmie	said	with	a	gentle	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	I	have	to?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaving	 no	 room	 for	 interpretation,	 Marmie	 said,	 “Yes	 dear,	 you	 have	 to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	she	added	with	a	bit	more	kindness.	“All	the	other	children	will	be	away from	their	families	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	will	you	go?”	Talise	asked,	bracing	herself	for	the	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	must	go	back	to	the	Storm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	though	she’d	been	expecting	this,	the	words	still	jarred	on	her	insides. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	will	you	survive?	Academy	training	lasts	ten	years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marmie	 took	 her	 hand	 out	 of	 Talise’s	 grip	 and	 wrapped	 it	 around	 her shoulders	instead.	She	began	tracing	swirls	into	Talise’s	upper	arm	as	she	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	voice	was	even	and	sweet,	telling	the	truth,	but	making	it	sound	better	than it	 was.	 “The	 first	 stage	 of	 training	 is	 only	 five	 years.	 You’ll	 have	 to	 test	 again after	that	to	get	into	the	second	stage.	And	you’ll	test	again	three	years	later.	The third	stage	is	only	two	years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	nodded,	wishing	the	years	could	go	by	as	quickly	as	this	day	seemed	to be	going. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marmie	continued.	“A	child	of	the	Storm	is	never	allowed	to	leave	the	Storm</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>unless	he	or	she	becomes	Master	Shaper.	Getting	into	the	academy	isn’t	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 the	 end	 of	 each	 year,	 there’s	 a	 competition.	 Based	 on	 the	 demonstrations during	 the	 competition,	 Emperor	 Flarius	 chooses	 one	 Master	 Shaper	 from	 the graduating	 class	 to	 work	 with	 him	 in	 the	 palace.	 You	 must	 become	 Master Shaper	or	else	you’ll	have	to	go	back	to	the	Storm	after	your	academy	training.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	all	that,”	Talise	said	jutting	out	her	bottom	lip.	“I	know	what	I	have to	do.	But	 <i class="calibre3">if</i>	I	pass	all	the	testing	and	make	it	through	all	three	stages	and	win	the competition	and	become	Master	Shaper…,”	she	bit	her	bottom	lip	again,	looking up	at	Marmie,	“will	you	be	able	to	move	to	the	palace	with	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	already	know	the	answer	to	that,”	Marmie	said	with	the	smallest	wink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise’s	 stomach	 sank	 all	 the	 way	 down	 to	 her	 toes.	 She	 did	 know	 that already.	 She’d	 asked	 these	 questions	 a	 hundred	 times	 in	 the	 last	 few	 months wishing	there	was	any	other	way.	It	didn’t	help	her	nerves	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	entire	future	rested	on	the	competition.	How	could	she	feel	anything	but anxiety	skewering	her	muscles	when	so	much	depended	on	this? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marmie	 met	 her	 eye	 and	 put	 two	 fingers	 under	 her	 chin.	 “You’re	 the	 best shaper	here.”	Then	she	shrugged	with	a	tease.	“Even	if	you	weren’t,	they	aren’t testing	how	good	you	are	at	shaping.	You	only	need	to	show	that	you	 <i class="calibre3">can</i>.	Any child	who	can	shape	is	welcome	to	the	academy	for	the	first	stage	of	training.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again,	 she	 knew	 all	 that,	 but	 it	 helped	 to	 hear	 the	 words	 anyway.	 Talise tucked	 herself	 closer	 to	 Marmie’s	 side,	 wishing	 they	 had	 a	 little	 more	 time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	just	a	few	more	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mercifully,	time	went	by	slowly	as	the	guards	tested	each	new	child,	let	them say	 goodbye,	 and	 then	 followed	 him	 or	 her	 into	 the	 back	 room	 to	 give	 more instructions	 about	 the	 academy.	 Hours	 passed	 by	 while	 more	 children	 were tested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	children	were	getting	antsy,	but	not	Talise.	She	drank	up	every	last minute	 she	 had.	 When	 she	 felt	 brave,	 she’d	 ask	 Marmie	 to	 tell	 her	 a	 story	 or recite	 one	 of	 their	 favorite	 memories.	 Marmie	 always	 complied	 with	 a	 gentle smile	and	a	reassuring	lilt	to	her	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 even	 as	 one	 of	 the	 more	 boring	 days	 of	 her	 life,	 time	 still	 marched	 on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon,	Talise	was	the	only	child	left	in	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 older	 guard	 entered	 and	 glanced	 around.	 Not	 noticing	 Talise	 at	 first,	 he checked	with	the	woman	guard.	They	whispered	together	for	a	moment	until	the woman	 guard	 pointed	 to	 the	 back	 corner	 where	 Talise	 and	 Marmie	 sat.	 The	 air seemed	to	grow	hotter	and	thicker.	More	anxiety	trampled	through	Talise	as	she tried	to	hold	her	head	high.	She	wanted	to	be	brave	for	Marmie.	She	knew	what</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>she	had	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 guard	 nodded	 and	 went	 to	 his	 usual	 place	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 room where	he	called	out	her	name,	almost	with	a	grimace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 walked	 over,	 pinching	 folds	 of	 her	 dress	 between	 two	 fingers	 before releasing	them	again.	She	took	a	deep	breath	when	she	reached	the	center	of	the room.	After	a	quick	bow	and	a	long	gulp,	she	looked	up	at	the	guard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stared	down	at	her,	surveying	every	inch	of	her	tattered	clothes.	His	eyes landed	heavily	on	the	bright	patch	near	her	hem.	He	looked	back	at	Marmie	and scoffed	 loudly.	 Slamming	 his	 writing	 pad	 shut,	 he	 looked	 at	 the	 other	 guard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	them	we’re	done	here.	They	can	take	the	children	to	the	docks	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">FOUR</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">TALISE	TOOK	A	STEP	BACK	WHILE	MARMIE	took	a	step	forward.	Talise</p>
<p class="calibre1">clutched	 at	 her	 dress.	 All	 of	 the	 softness	 in	 Marmie’s	 face	 hardened	 to	 jagged lines.	 Her	 cheekbones	 cut	 like	 knives.	 No	 more	 honey	 and	 sparkles.	 When Marmie	spoke	now,	her	voice	was	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	can	shape.	You	are	required	to	give	her	entrance	to	a	training	academy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	be	stupid,	vermin,”	the	guard	said	as	he	peered	down	at	Marmie.	“<i class="calibre3">No</i> <i class="calibre3">one</i>	 from	 the	 Storm	 can	 shape.	 How	 did	 you	 even	 get	 enough	 money	 for	 the riverboat?	Did	you	sell	your	hair? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 and	 the	 other	 guard	 glanced	 at	 each	 other	 before	 bursting	 into	 a	 fit	 of laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marmie	reached	for	the	frizzy	ends	of	her	hair,	all	uneven	and	dull.	At	the	last second,	she	turned	her	hand	into	a	fist	and	set	her	jaw.	“Test	her,”	Marmie	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guard	began	walking	toward	the	back	room,	still	letting	out	the	whispers of	a	laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marmie	 stood	 in	 front	 of	 him	 leaving	 only	 a	 few	 inches	 between	 them.	 She crossed	her	arms	over	her	chest	and	said	more	firmly,	“Test	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	out	of	my	way,”	the	guard	said,	brushing	her	to	the	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	such	weak	muscles	inside	her,	Marmie	staggered	at	the	man’s	touch.	She gripped	him	by	the	forearm	to	catch	her	balance	and	tried	to	steady	herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	wrung	her	hands	all	around	each	other	as	she	watched	the	pair	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps	 the	 guard	 only	 needed	 to	 see	 that	 she	 was	 capable	 of	 shaping.	 Maybe she	 should	 just	 show	 him	 what	 she	 could	 do.	 But	 she	 feared	 disrespecting	 her elder.	 He	 clearly	 had	 a	 prejudice	 that	 ran	 deep.	 Would	 shaping	 get	 them	 into more	trouble? </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Marmie	steadied	herself,	she	said,	“The	girl	can	shape.	You	must	test her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guard	moved	to	push	her	away	again,	but	with	greater	force	this	time.	To protect	herself,	Marmie	grabbed	his	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guard	ripped	his	arm	from	her	grip.	“You	dare	attack	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	though	it	was	clear	an	attack	was	far	from	her	mind,	Marmie	narrowed</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	eyes.	“I’ll	do	whatever	it	takes	to	make	sure	this	girl	goes	to	the	academy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guard	moved	so	swiftly,	Talise	didn’t	realize	he	had	Marmie	by	the	wrist</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>until	 he	 was	 already	 reaching	 for	 the	 wooden	 baton	 under	 his	 tunic.	 If	 Talise didn’t	do	something,	Marmie	would	be	beaten.	Her	frail	body	couldn’t	handle	a beating	of	any	kind	right	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop!”	Talise	shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 only	 seemed	 to	 add	 fire	 to	 the	 guard’s	 flame.	 He	 pulled	 the	 baton	 out while	 a	 hint	 of	 glee	 passed	 over	 his	 features.	 If	 she	 was	 going	 to	 do	 anything, clearly	words	would	not	be	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 took	 one	 glance	 around	 the	 room	 and	 did	 the	 only	 thing	 that	 seemed logical	 in	 the	 moment.	 Many	 people	 considered	 fire	 to	 be	 the	 most	 difficult element	to	master,	so	she	lit	a	fire	in	her	palm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thinking	 only	 of	 Marmie’s	 safety,	 Talise	 took	 a	 fistful	 of	 the	 guard’s	 tunic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,”	she	said	as	she	forced	him	to	turn	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 his	 feet	 moved	 to	 face	 her,	 the	 tunic	 in	 her	 left	 hand	 collided	 with	 the flame	in	her	right.	Her	eyebrows	flew	up	her	forehead	as	the	silk	fabric	caught on	fire.	The	guard	let	out	a	gasp	that	could	have	fluttered	the	curtains	as	much	as air	shaping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 shaped	 away	 the	 fire	 in	 her	 palm	 instantly,	 but	 the	 damage	 had	 been done.	 The	 guard	 seemed	 too	 surprised,	 or	 angry,	 to	 react	 to	 his	 still	 burning tunic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though	less	than	a	second	had	passed,	it	felt	like	five	hundred.	Talise	scanned the	room,	letting	her	mind	whirl	as	it	tried	to	find	a	way	to	fix	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I’ll	 never	 go	 to	 the	 academy	 now</i>,	 she	 thought.  <i class="calibre3">I	 won’t	 even	 go	 back	 to	 the</i> <i class="calibre3">Storm.	They’re	going	to	kill	me	here	and	Marmie	too. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	at	the	curtains.	She	could	pull	them	down	and	suffocate	the	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No,	 she’d	 never	 be	 strong	 enough	 to	 rip	 them	 away.  <i class="calibre3">Useless</i>.	 Her	 tote	 bag	 of dresses	was	closer,	but	the	fire	might	be	out	of	control	by	the	time	she	got	a	dress out	of	it.  <i class="calibre3">Also	useless</i>.	The	bowl	of	water	for	shape	testing	would	work.	Her	foot had	already	taken	a	step	before	she	realized	that	even	that	would	take	too	much time.	The	bowl	was	on	the	other	side	of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	a	single	thought	about	the	consequences,	Talise	used	her	shaping	to raise	the	water	out	of	the	bowl	and	splash	it	onto	the	guard’s	tunic.	The	fire	was out,	and	it	had	only	taken	the	longest	three	seconds	of	her	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	 she	 could	 let	 out	 a	 breath	 of	 relief,	 the	 guard’s	 mouth	 dropped.	 It looked	more	like	surprise	than	anger	this	time,	but	now	she	was	all	too	aware	of just	how	wet	the	guard’s	clothes	were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 guard	 worked	 his	 jaw	 up	 and	 down	 as	 he	 looked	 from	 his	 shirt	 to	 the empty	bowl	and	back	to	his	shirt	again.	He	touched	the	damp	fabric	as	if	daring</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>it	to	be	real. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	it	was	real.	Talise’s	stomach	sank.	She	had	to	do	something.	“I	can	fix	it,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	said.	The	words	sounded	so	stupid	as	soon	as	they	left	her	mouth.	She	turned her	head	to	the	ground,	afraid	to	make	eye	contact.	“Well,	not	fix	it.	At	least	not the	fabric	that	got	burnt.	But	I	can	help	with	the	wet	clothes	at	least.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guard	took	a	step	away	from	her,	his	eyes	widening	every	second. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Undeterred,	 she	 raised	 her	 hands	 until	 the	 palms	 were	 an	 inch	 over	 the	 wet fabric.	Then,	she	shaped	as	much	air	as	she	could	to	blow	against	the	fabric.	If only	she	were	a	little	better	at	shaping,	she	could	just	shape	the	water	out	of	his clothes	and	back	into	the	bowl.	Instead,	the	air	shaping	would	have	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 guard	 took	 another	 step	 back	 and	 grabbed	 both	 of	 her	 wrists.	 He	 stared down	into	her	palms	with	his	mouth	gaping	open.	“You	…	you	can	shape	three elements?	How	is	this	possible?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Four,”	Marmie	said.	Her	breath	was	weak,	but	she	was	still	on	her	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guard	turned	to	her	and	shook	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marmie	 stood	 a	 little	 taller	 and	 set	 her	 jaw.	 “Not	 three,	 she	 can	 shape	 four. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Show	them,	Talise.	Do	the	snake	like	you	did	on	the	boat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 was	 back	 to	 pinching	 the	 folds	 of	 fabric	 in	 her	 dress.	 The	 guard	 was astonished?	Not	angry?	Maybe	he	was	still	both,	but	the	astonishment	seemed	to be	 winning	 at	 the	 moment.	 Would	 shaping	 something	 fancy	 get	 her	 into	 more trouble? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marmie	gave	her	a	gentle	nod,	and	the	lines	around	her	eyes	softened	to	the face	Talise	knew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	a	gulp,	Talise	moved	her	hand	toward	the	pile	of	dirt	in	the	center	of	the floor.	 She	 pulled	 in	 her	 stomach	 muscles	 and	 tried	 to	 work	 past	 the	 anxiety threatening	to	smother	her.	As	the	little	snake	started	to	take	shape,	the	woman guard	took	a	step	forward	with	eyes	full	of	wonder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	 course	 she	 will	 have	 place	 at	 the	 academy,”	 the	 first	 guard	 said	 as	 he touched	the	burnt	hem	of	his	tunic.	“I’ve	never	seen	a	child	with	such	advanced shaping.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 woman	 guard	 brushed	 a	 strand	 of	 hair	 behind	 her	 ear.	 “She	 shouldn’t train	 at	 any	 of	 the	 academies	 in	 the	 Gate.	 She	 should	 go	 straight	 to	 the	 elite academy	in	the	Crown.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marmie	 gave	 a	 smug	 grin,	 but	 Talise’s	 insides	 were	 bubbling	 over	 with excitement.	“If	I	train	there,	will	I	finish	sooner?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	 the	 first	 guard	 said	 as	 he	 opened	 his	 writing	 pad.	 “Training	 always takes	 ten	 years,	 but	 it	 will	 be	 more	 advanced	 at	 the	 elite	 academy.	 I’ll	 have	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>write	a	special	recommendation	for	you,	but	you	should	get	in	with	no	problem.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	wasn’t	exactly	the	news	she	wanted	to	hear,	but	it	didn’t	take	away	any of	her	excitement.	She	did	it.	She	was	going	to	the	academy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Say	 your	 goodbyes,”	 the	 guard	 said,	 his	 eyes	 still	 on	 his	 writing	 pad.	 And with	those	words,	all	the	excitement	was	sucked	up	and	out	of	her	body,	leaving nothing	but	a	pit	in	her	stomach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marmie	 brushed	 the	 hair	 out	 of	 Talise’s	 face	 as	 she	 set	 the	 strap	 of	 the	 tote bag	on	her	shoulder.	“Work	hard,”	Marmie	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	write	to	you.”	Talise’s	lip	quivered.	“Every	week.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marmie	brushed	her	thumb	under	Talise’s	chin,	giving	her	a	smile.	“And	I’ll write	to	you.	Twice	a	week.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 if	 I	 forget	 your	 face?”	 Talise	 bit	 her	 bottom	 lip	 to	 keep	 it	 from quivering	again.	She	knew	she	had	to	go	to	the	academy.	She	knew	she	needed it.	But	why	did	it	have	to	mean	leaving	Marmie?	Why	couldn’t	they	go	together? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	 never	 forget	 my	 face	 as	 long	 as	 you	 love	 me,”	 Marmie	 said	 with	 a laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	what	if	I	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marmie	bent	down	to	leave	a	soft	kiss	on	Talise’s	cheek.	With	her	head	still bent,	 she	 whispered	 into	 Talise’s	 ear.	 “You	 must	 try.	 You	 must	 promise	 that you’ll	do	your	best	to	become	Master	Shaper.	You	can’t	entertain	any	thoughts of	rejoining	me	in	the	Storm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	pained	her	more	than	anything	else	that	day,	but	Talise	knew	what	she	had to	 say.	 She	 put	 both	 her	 hands	 on	 Marmie’s	 cheeks	 and	 said,	 “I	 will	 try.	 In	 ten years,	I’ll	be	the	best	shaper	Kamdaria	has	ever	known.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">MRS.	DEW	ALWAYS	POINTED	TO	THE	SLATE	board	as	if	it	held	the	key	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">life’s	 mysteries.	 Talise	 preferred	 the	 academy	 lessons	 that	 included	 actual shaping.	 Mrs.	 Dew	 had	 taught	 them	 nothing	 but	 theory	 for	 the	 past	 month.	 It didn’t	seem	very	smart	when	the	competition	was	only	a	month	away,	but	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dew	had	been	the	top	instructor	at	the	elite	academy	for	twenty-five	years.	Her methods	weren’t	up	for	debate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	sighed	and	started	shaping	little	bursts	of	air	from	her	palm.	The	bursts reached	just	high	enough	to	tickle	her	hair	before	they	would	fizzle	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	 Dew	 slapped	 her	 palm	 against	 the	 slate.	 “That	 is	 why	 you	 must	 never attempt	to	freeze	water	while	you’re	shaping	it.	You’ll	give	yourself	hypothermia and	your	fingers	could	break	clean	off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 emphasized	 the	 point	 by	 making	 some	 gesture	 with	 her	 hands.	 She	 was probably	 miming	 her	 fingers	 falling	 off,	 but	 since	 Talise	 sat	 in	 the	 back	 of	 the classroom,	she	couldn’t	tell	for	sure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	pulled	a	letter	from	the	front	pocket	of	her	school	uniform.	Her	latest letter	 from	 Marmie.	 She	 traced	 a	 finger	 over	 her	 favorite	 paragraph,	 trying	 to carve	the	words	into	her	mind	so	she’d	never	forget	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Anyway,	 I’m	 sure	 you	 don’t	 care	 about	 all	 that,	 but	 the	 point	 is	 it	 worked!	 I</i> <i class="calibre3">finally	 grew	 a	 flower	 in	 the	 Storm.	 I’ve	 learned	 a	 lot	 from	 living	 here,	 and	 the</i> <i class="calibre3">most	 interesting	 thing	 is	 this:	 without	 hope,	 people	 have	 nothing.	 They	 aren’t</i> <i class="calibre3">happy;	 they	 don’t	 live.	 But	 the	 smallest	 things	 can	 change	 that.	 You	 should	 see</i> <i class="calibre3">what	 this	 little	 flower	 has	 done	 to	 the	 neighborhood.	 It’s	 like	 there’s	 magic	 all</i> <i class="calibre3">around	us	now. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Magic.	 Talise	 loved	 that	 part.	 Marmie	 had	 never	 sent	 such	 a	 happy	 letter	 in the	 ten	 years	 since	 Talise	 had	 gone	 to	 the	 academy.	 Maybe	 it	 was	 just	 because the	 competition	 was	 so	 close.	 Talise	 knew	 Marmie	 never	 expected	 to	 live	 long enough	to	see	Talise	compete.	But	she	had.	Just	like	magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	had	saved	just	enough	money	for	a	riverboat	ride	from	the	Storm	to	the Crown.	Soon,	Marmie	would	use	it	to	travel	to	Ridgerock	Palace	for	a	temporary</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>visit.	Long	enough	to	see	Talise	in	the	competition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	several	more	slaps	to	the	slate	board,	Mrs.	Dew	released	them	for	lunch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	bowed	to	the	portrait	of	Emperor	Flarius	as	she	left	the	room.	His	golden crown	never	seemed	oppressive	to	her,	but	every	so	often,	his	eyes	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shrugging	away	the	feeling,	Talise	went	through	the	doorway	to	find	Wendy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	outside	the	classroom,	Talise	bumped	into	a	student	whose	eyes	were	on the	ground.	He	had	light	brown	skin	and	a	thin	mustache	and	goatee.	He	held	his shoulders	back	with	an	easy	confidence	that	usually	came	from	those	born	in	the Crown.	Aaden.	At	least	she	thought	his	name	was	Aaden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Earlier	that	week,	all	the	top	students	in	the	final	year	of	the	third	stage	were combined	into	one	class.	Students	from	academies	all	over	Kamdaria	were	now in	one	class	at	the	elite	academy,	and	Talise	only	knew	a	handful	of	them.	Based on	his	demeanor,	she	guessed	he	came	from	another	academy	in	the	Crown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry	about	that,”	Talise	said	as	she	passed	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aaden	scowled	as	he	trudged	past	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Rude. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Marmie	would	have	scolded	her	for	making	such	a	harsh	judgment.	As	Talise</p>
<p class="calibre1">wandered	down	the	hallway,	she	opened	her	mind	to	other	possibilities.	Maybe he	was	nervous	about	being	at	a	new	academy.	Maybe	he	just	needed	a	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 finally	 found	 Wendy	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 hall.	 She	 was	 checking	 on	 a pastry	 in	 her	 school	 bag.	 “Just	 a	 little	 something	 to	 add	 to	 my	 lunch,”	 Wendy said	as	she	looked	away	with	a	smile.	They	walked	side	by	side	as	they	headed for	the	dining	courtyard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Luckily,	the	academy	paid	for	their	lunches	or	Talise	might	never	have	eaten. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marmie	 sent	 her	 money	 as	 often	 as	 she	 could.	 And	 Talise	 always	 sent	 it	 back, except	when	she	was	desperate.	The	academy	also	paid	for	her	school	uniforms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 spent	 so	 much	 time	 in	 training,	 no	 one	 ever	 realized	 Talise	 only	 had	 two dresses	apart	from	her	school	clothes.	Her	other	possessions	were	fewer	than	the fingers	on	her	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fish	 again?”	 Talise	 asked	 as	 she	 wrinkled	 her	 nose.	 Fish	 always	 reminded her	of	the	Storm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	giggled	and	tugged	her	through	the	gate.	“What	do	you	expect	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	live	so	close	to	the	palace?	Ridgerock	Lake	is	full	of	fish.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	scowled,	not	caring	if	Wendy	noticed	how	her	feet	were	dragging. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	did	notice.	She	shot	Talise	a	disapproving	look	before	erasing	it	with	a smile.	 “At	 least	 there’s	 noodle	 soup	 to	 go	 along	 with	 it.	 You	 love	 the	 noodle soup.”	Her	eyebrows	teetered	upward,	begging	Talise	to	agree. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>Unable	 to	 stop	 herself,	 Talise	 let	 out	 a	 chuckle.	 “Yes,	 I	 do	 like	 the	 noodle soup.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	always	had	a	way	of	scolding	without	making	it	feel	like	a	drudgery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	like	Marmie.	Talise	had	been	drawn	to	Wendy	for	that	exact	reason.	Wendy was	sweet	and	gentle	like	Marmie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 look,”	 Wendy	 said,	 bouncing	 on	 her	 heels.	 “They’re	 even	 serving	 the soup	in	the	round	bowls	instead	of	the	square.	You	love	the	round	bowls.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 shook	 her	 head	 but	 let	 out	 another	 chuckle.	 “I	 don’t	 love	 them.	 I	 just think	they’re	easier	to	hold.	And	I	only	said	that	one	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	receiving	their	food,	Talise	quickly	scanned	the	courtyard	for	a	place	to eat.	 One	 end	 of	 the	 courtyard	 looked	 empty	 except	 for	 a	 single	 person.	 Aaden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	she	had	been	right	about	him	needing	a	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	know	him?”	Talise	asked,	pointing	to	the	lonely	young	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	nodded.	Of	course	she	did.	Wendy	knew	everyone.	It	was	part	of	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">charm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aaden,”	Wendy	said.	“He’s	from	the	other	academy	in	the	Crown.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	go	sit	with	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy’s	 eyes	 widened,	 but	 she	 tried	 to	 smile	 the	 expression	 away.	 “I	 don’t know	him	 <i class="calibre3">that</i>	well.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 started	 walking	 toward	 him.	 “Maybe	 he	 doesn’t	 know	 anyone	 in	 the new	class.	We	should	be	friends	with	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	 blinked	 and	 glanced	 around	 the	 courtyard.	 “Maybe	 he	 wants	 to	 be alone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 gave	 her	 friend	 a	 sideways	 glance.	 Usually	 Wendy	 was	 the	 one	 who wanted	to	make	new	friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,	there’s	Claye	over	there.	Let’s	go	sit	with	him.”	Even	with	her	hands full	 of	 dishes,	 Wendy	 managed	 to	 nudge	 Talise	 away	 from	 that	 part	 of	 the courtyard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	grinning	about?”	Wendy	asked	as	she	settled	into	the	seat	next to	Claye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 brown	 eyes	 looked	 bright	 with	 a	 joke	 that	 would	 probably	 befit	 a	 ten-year-old	 boy.	 “I	 just	 slurped	 my	 noodle	 the	 wrong	 way	 and	 it	 came	 out	 my nose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 disgusting.”	 Talise	 tried	 not	 to	 think	 about	 it	 too	 much	 or	 she wouldn’t	be	able	to	eat	anything	at	this	meal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Claye	 snickered,	 seeming	 to	 care	 even	 less	 than	 usual	 about	 her	 opinion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And,”	he	said	rounding	on	Wendy.	“Mr.	Cobble	confirmed	that	training	the	day</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>before	a	competition	can	weaken	your	muscles.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	 stiffened	 before	 she	 shook	 her	 head	 firmly.	 “Only	 if	 you	 train	 too much.	Surely,	no	training	at	all	hurts	more	than	it	helps.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	idly	put	the	spoon	to	her	lips	as	Wendy	and	Clayed	jumped	into	a	deep discussion	 on	 which	 was	 best.	 They	 both	 had	 compelling	 arguments	 that	 had been	picked	apart	in	detail	over	the	last	year	by	every	student	in	the	final	year	of the	third	stage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Right	 now,	 Talise	 was	 more	 captivated	 by	 the	 young	 man	 who	 stared	 at	 the ground	 and	 ate	 alone.	 So	 quiet.	 If	 he	 had	 so	 little	 to	 say,	 he	 must	 have	 had mountains	of	things	going	on	in	his	head. </p>

<p class="calibre1">plate	of	grilled	fish	over	to	Wendy	and	Claye.	“You	two	share	this,”	she	said	as she	stood	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	cleaned	her	soup	dish	at	the	washing	station	and	watched	Aaden	as	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">worked.	 His	 neatly	 trimmed	 hair	 had	 been	 combed	 with	 precision.	 The	 black strands	were	so	shiny,	they	gleamed	in	the	sunlight.	His	clothes	hung	stiffer	than hers,	which	could	only	mean	his	school	uniform	had	recently	been	pressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	definitely	from	the	Crown	then.	Only	someone	from	the	inner	circle</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	Kamdaria	could	afford	such	a	luxury.	She	didn’t	know	whether	to	be	awed	or angry	by	how	casually	he	broadcasted	his	privilege. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead,	 she	 focused	 on	 the	 one	 thing	 she	 knew	 for	 sure.	 He	 ate	 his	 entire lunch	 alone.	 Someone	 like	 that	 must	 have	 needed	 a	 friend.	 She	 tried	 to	 smile with	the	same	warmth	Marmie	had	taught	her	as	she	headed	his	way.	He	stood up	even	before	she	got	to	him,	as	if	eager	to	avoid	any	interaction.	Hopefully,	he only	wanted	to	avoid	her	because	he	was	nervous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	Talise,”	she	said	when	she	reached	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aaden	gave	her	a	short	glance	through	the	side	of	his	eye.	“I	don’t	care.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	raised	an	eyebrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	began	marching	toward	the	washing	station,	and	his	body	language	didn’t invite	her	to	join.	But	she	did	anyway.	Her	lips	twitched	at	the	corners	while	she tried	to	decide	if	she	should	be	offended	or	humored	by	his	brash	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Not	funny</i>,	she	finally	decided.	But	maybe	he	only	pushed	her	away	because he	was	nervous.	Attempting	a	friendly	smirk,	she	asked,	“Is	that	how	you	greet everyone?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	he	said	with	utterly	no	explanation	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	had	reached	the	washing	station	now,	and	Aaden	kept	his	eyes	down	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	scrubbed	his	dishes	clean. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	in	her	told	Talise	to	give	up.	This	young	man	smelled	like	trouble and	it	wrinkled	her	nose	even	more	than	the	grilled	fish	had.	She	wanted	to	walk away.	She	almost	did	when	some	of	Aaden’s	washing	water	splashed	onto	her.	It didn’t	seem	like	an	accident. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	then	she	remembered	Marmie	and	the	Storm.	She	knew	desperation	when</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>she	 saw	 it.	 It	 looked	 like	 anger	 when	 it	 was	 really	 fear.	 It	 looked	 like	 hatred when	it	was	really	sadness.  <i class="calibre3">One	more	time</i>,	she	thought.  <i class="calibre3">I’ll	try	one	more	time	to</i> <i class="calibre3">befriend	him</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	shaped	the	splashed	water	out	of	her	clothes	and	back	into	the	washing bin.	“What’s	your	primary?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fire,”	Aaden	said,	putting	as	much	heat	into	the	word	as	an	actual	flame.	He dropped	his	clean	dishes	onto	the	pile	and	whirled	around	to	face	her.	“Just	like you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such	simple	words.	How	did	he	make	them	sound	like	a	threat? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 lips	 parted	 as	 their	 eyes	 met.	 With	 his	 earlier	 words,	 he	 had	 pushed	 her away.	Now,	he	practically	begged	her	to	respond.	For	once,	she	had	no	idea	what to	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	did	he	know	her	primary?	What	else	did	he	know	about	her? </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	opened	her	mouth	to	ask,	but	his	eagerness	for	a	response	evaporated.	He turned	his	back	on	her	and	said,	“Leave	me	alone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stalked	off	with	his	shoulders	hunched	forward	and	a	fist	forming	in	one hand.	For	a	moment,	she	almost	followed	him.	His	anger	only	made	her	think	he was	really	desperate.	For	 <i class="calibre3">something</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	only	thing	holding	her	in	place	were	those	words	he	spoke	that	felt	like	a threat.  <i class="calibre3">Just	like	you</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	he	was	so	quick	to	threaten,	maybe	it	was	because	he	felt	threatened	by	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	he	wanted	the	title	of	Master	Shaper.	Talise	had	been	the	top	of	her	class for	so	long,	she	couldn’t	even	remember	what	real	competition	felt	like. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">This</i>,	she	thought.  <i class="calibre3">It	feels	like	this</i>. </p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">TWO	 WEEKS	 LATER,	 Talise	 rummaged	 through	 the	 books	 in	 the	 library.	 All she	needed	was	a	book	that	classified	the	different	wind	types.	If	she	could	just understand	 where	 the	 different	 types	 of	 wind	 came	 from,	 it	 would	 be	 easier	 to shape	air	in	the	same	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 almost	 rolled	 her	 eyes	 at	 the	 thought.	 Apparently,	 Mrs.	 Dew	 had	 been right	about	theory.	It	really	did	help	with	technique. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Biting	 her	 bottom	 lip,	 she	 opened	 another	 air	 book.	 She	 slammed	 it	 shut	 a moment	 later	 when	 it	 showed	 the	 same	 diagram	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 books	 showed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Air	 shaping	 must	 come	 from	 the	 lungs.	 She	 knew	 all	 that.	 It	 didn’t	 help	 her understand	wind	any	better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	golden	spine	of	another	book	caught	her	eye.	The	title	looked	promising. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a> <i class="calibre3">Air	 Shaping	 Origins</i>.	 Before	 she	 could	 grab	 it	 off	 the	 shelf,	 a	 clatter	 from	 a nearby	aisle	caught	her	attention.	She	peeked	around	the	bookshelf,	expecting	to see	one	of	the	younger	students.	Instead	she	saw	Aaden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’d	 avoided	 him	 since	 their	 brief	 conversation.	 Not	 that	 it	 had	 been	 that hard.	 Aaden	 stayed	 away	 from	 her	 and	 everyone	 else.	 She	 learned	 that	 Wendy had	already	tried	to	befriend	him	and	had	failed	as	miserably	as	she	had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aaden	crouched	over	a	painting	of	Ridgerock	Palace	that	was	supposed	to	be hanging	on	the	wall.	He	glanced	around	from	one	end	of	the	room	to	the	next. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	 thinking,	 Talise	 hid	 herself	 behind	 the	 bookshelf	 and	 then	 peeked	 out again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thinking	he	was	alone,	Aaden	bent	over	the	painting	and	ran	a	finger	over	the cherry	trees	standing	like	sentinels	at	the	main	gate	of	the	palace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 studying	 the	 painting,	 he	 did	 the	 unthinkable	 and	 pulled	 the	 painting from	its	frame.	The	canvas	stretched	as	he	rolled	it	up	tight.	He	then	stuck	it	into the	jacket	of	his	uniform. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise’s	mouth	was	still	hanging	open	when	he	left	the	library.	He	didn’t	even bow	 to	 the	 emperor’s	 portrait	 on	 his	 way	 out.	 Her	 brain	 was	 busy	 processing what	 he	 had	 done,	 but	 it	 didn’t	 stop	 her	 feet	 from	 following.	 She	 put	 enough distance	between	them	to	not	seem	suspicious,	but	her	ears	were	hyper	aware	of each	of	his	movements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 left	 the	 instructional	 building	 and	 flew	 through	 the	 gardens	 to	 get	 to	 the training	building.	She	almost	lost	him	when	he	made	two	sharp	turns	in	the	halls of	the	training	building,	but	she	found	him	again	a	moment	later.	He	had	settled into	an	empty	training	room	that	was	a	little	smaller	than	the	others.	It	stood	in the	back	corner	of	the	building.	That,	combined	with	its	small	size,	meant	hardly anyone	used	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aaden	had	shut	the	door	when	he	entered,	but	Talise	managed	to	push	it	open slightly	without	his	notice.	He	was	too	busy	propping	the	painting	up	on	a	desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	traced	his	fingers	over	the	cherry	trees	again.	The	pink	blossoms	burst	out of	the	branches	like	little	clouds	of	delight.	He	stared	at	the	painting	for	so	long, Talise	 was	 ready	 to	 give	 up	 and	 just	 tell	 Mrs.	 Dew	 how	 he	 had	 stolen	 the painting	from	the	library. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	 when	 she	 lifted	 her	 foot	 to	 walk,	 Aaden	 took	 a	 step	 away	 from	 the painting	and	a	fire	burst	out	of	his	palm.	The	fire	burned	in	a	column,	but	little by	little,	bits	of	the	column	drifted	away,	and	a	tree	began	to	form. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fire	sculpture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	tree	was	formed,	it	grew	larger	until	it	burned	as	high	as	Aaden’s</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>chin.	Then,	he	stared	at	the	tree	like	a	mother	coaxing	her	baby	to	eat.	When	his eyes	narrowed,	the	branches	of	the	trees	seemed	to	shudder.	He	clenched	his	jaw and	one	branch	seemed	to	grow	small	pustules. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	impressive	as	it	was,	that	didn’t	seem	to	be	what	Aaden	wanted.	The	fire vanished	 as	 he	 dropped	 his	 hand	 away	 and	 let	 out	 a	 groan.	 He	 kicked	 the	 wall twice	and	then	did	it	again,	all	the	way	down	to	the	pustules. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 didn’t	 matter	 if	 he	 was	 doing	 what	 he	 wanted	 or	 not,	 fire	 sculptures	 were hard.	His	were	detailed	and	looked	as	though	they	were	alive.	On	his	fourth	try, one	of	the	pustules	popped	open	and	a	blossom	appeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	gasped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 couldn’t	 help	 it.	 She	 had	 no	 idea	 he	 was	 attempting	 something	 so complex. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aaden’s	tree	vanished	as	he	whirled	around	to	face	her.	His	lips	were	pressed to	a	thin	line	while	a	huff	of	air	burst	from	his	nose.	He	worked	his	jaw	up	and down	as	he	shaped	a	fireball	in	each	of	his	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	balls	flew	toward	her,	and	she	leapt	back	with	a	yelp.	One	of	the	balls	hit the	 cement	 wall,	 but	 the	 other	 hit	 the	 door	 right	 next	 to	 her	 arm.	 It	 was	 close enough	that	it	burned	her	forearm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aaden	glared	at	her	as	he	formed	two	more	fireballs	in	his	hands.	Not	needing anymore	encouragement,	she	ducked	away	and	ran	out	of	the	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 the	 fresh	 air	 blowing	 on	 the	 burn,	 the	 stinging	 decreased.	 She	 went straight	for	the	kitchen	building,	hoping	to	find	some	ice.	Even	with	such	a	direct mission,	she	could	barely	focus	on	the	burn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aaden’s	trees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	incredible,	she	had	to	admit	it.	And	to	emulate	the	same	trees	that stood	 in	 front	 of	 the	 palace	 was	 a	 stroke	 of	 genius.	 It	 was	 sure	 to	 catch	 the emperor’s	eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	reality	settled	into	her,	leaving	her	insides	a	writhing	mess.	Aaden	had	a chance	of	winning	Master	Shaper.	Maybe	a	better	chance	than	her.	Who	was	she kidding,	he	had	a	way	better	chance	than	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	like	anyone	from	the	Crown,	he	had	everything	he	ever	needed	without</p>
<p class="calibre1">even	 blinking.	 That’s	 why	 most	 people	 from	 the	 Crown	 didn’t	 care	 about becoming	Master	Shaper.	They	didn’t	need	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 when	 someone	 from	 the	 Crown	  <i class="calibre3">wanted</i>	 to	 become	 Master	 Shaper,	 they did.	 End	 of	 story.	 Aaden	 probably	 had	 a	 personal	 shaping	 tutor	 that	 had	 been teaching	him	for	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 had	 spent	 the	 past	 ten	 years	 keeping	 her	 promise	 to	 Marmie,	 training</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>hard	 with	 the	 intent	 to	 win.	 She’d	 been	 the	 best	 for	 so	 long,	 she	 stopped worrying	about	the	competition	years	ago.	Everyone	knew	she	was	going	to	win. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	still	she	never	stopped	training	as	hard	as	she	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,	all	that	hard	work	fizzled	out	in	just	one	afternoon.	All	along,	there	had been	someone	just	as	good	as	her	at	the	other	academy	in	the	Crown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	she	was	going	to	win	the	competition,	she	needed	to	up	her	game. </p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">THE	 LAST	 PARAGRAPH	 OF	 HER	 LETTER	 TO	 Marmie	 seemed	 a	 little</p>
<p class="calibre1">ridiculous.	Truth	laced	every	word,	but	that	didn’t	mean	she	should	send	it.	But what	else	could	she	say?	Talise	read	through	it	one	last	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">He	 did	 fire	 sculptures	 like	 I’ve	 never	 seen	 before.	 Somehow,	 he	 managed	 to</i> <i class="calibre3">get	little	cherry	blossoms	to	burst	out	of	the	fire	branches.	I’ll	admit	it,	Marmie. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I’m	scared.	I’ve	tried	so	hard	to	win,	but	I	think	he’s	better	than	me.	At	least	I’m</i> <i class="calibre3">not	a	child	anymore.	If	I	have	to	go	back	to	the	Storm,	I’d	probably	survive	now. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">And	then	I’d	get	to	be	with	you	again.	That	doesn’t	sound	so	bad. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Marmie	 would	 be	 angry.	 She’d	 scold	 and	 remind	 Talise	 of	 her	 promise,	 but none	 of	 that	 changed	 how	 Talise	 felt	 in	 this	 moment.	 Living	 in	 the	 Storm	 with Marmie	really	didn’t	sound	so	bad.	Certainly	not	as	bad	as	it	did	when	she	was	a child.	She	was	stronger	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shaking	her	head,	Talise	got	a	blank	sheet	of	paper	to	start	a	new	letter.	She couldn’t	 send	 something	 like	 that	 so	 close	 to	 the	 competition.	 Marmie	 would worry	too	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	to	say	something	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	stared	at	the	blank	paper	for	two	and	half	minutes	before	she	gave	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 added	 a	 quick,  <i class="calibre3">Please	 don’t	 worry.	 I’m	 still	 going	 to	 try</i>.	 to	 the	 end	 of	 the letter	and	shoved	it	into	its	envelope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 the	 letter	 in	 hand,	 Talise	 left	 her	 room	 to	 find	 the	 nearest	 academy guard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	you	make	sure	this	is	sent	tonight?”	Talise	asked	the	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	nodded	as	she	tucked	the	letter	into	a	hidden	pocket	of	her	yellow silk	tunic.		“Any	special	instructions?”	the	guard	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.”	 Talise	 smoothed	 the	 bottom	 of	 her	 uniform	 so	 she	 could	 avoid	 the guard’s	eye.	Why	did	they	always	have	to	ask	that?	She	stuffed	a	hand	into	her pocket,	but	it	only	reminded	her	of	how	empty	that	pocket	was.	No	money	for special	 requests.	 No	 money	 for	 extra	 pastries.	 No	 money	 for	 anything	 but survival. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 gulped	 as	 she	 turned	 away.	 How	 could	 she	 forget	 so	 easily	 the challenges	 of	 the	 Storm?	 She	 had	 been	 in	 the	 Crown	 for	 ten	 years,	 but	 the challenges	 still	 chased	 after	 her.	 They	 were	 little	 things	 like	 not	 being	 able	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>afford	 a	 pass	 to	 leave	 academy	 grounds.	 Never	 having	 anything	 extra	 beyond necessities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	with	all	her	necessities	taken	care	of	for	ten	years	straight,	it	was	easy	to forget	how	bad	things	in	the	Storm	were.	Marmie	had	sacrificed	so	much	to	get her	here.	She	couldn’t	let	that	sacrifice	be	in	vain. </p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">LATE	 THAT	 EVENING,	 Talise	 slipped	 out	 of	 bed	 still	 wearing	 her	 school uniform.	She	tiptoed	out	of	her	room	and	held	her	breath	as	she	walked	down	a hall	where	one	of	the	night	guards	patrolled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	hall	remained	empty	as	Talise	tiptoed	down	it.	Just	as	she	was	ready	to round	 a	 corner,	 she	 heard	 footsteps.	 There	 were	 punishments	 for	 sneaking around	at	night,	but	none	of	them	were	worse	than	losing	the	competition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	tucked	herself	into	a	supply	closet	just	as	the	footsteps	came	around	the corner.	Who	was	it?	Did	they	see	her? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	gripped	her	elbows.	She	tried	to	force	herself	to	breathe,	but	her	lungs seemed	to	think	it	would	be	more	fun	to	hold	her	breath	until	she	couldn’t	stand it	another	second.	Just	when	she	sucked	in	a	loud	breath,	the	door	to	the	supply closet	swung	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	hands	flew	into	the	air	in	defense.	“I	was	just—”	Talise’s	words	cut	off	as she	blinked.	“Wendy?	What	are	you	doing	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy’s	finger	flew	to	her	lips	as	she	looked	over	her	shoulder.	“I	was	going to	the	bathroom,”	she	whispered.	“What	are	 <i class="calibre3">you</i>	doing	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um.”	Talise	began	rubbing	a	hand	up	and	down	her	forearm.	“I	need	to	train for	the	competition.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	 let	 out	 a	 snort	 and	 a	 new	 pair	 of	 footsteps	 started	 coming	 from	 a nearby	 hall.	 Her	 eyes	 widened	 as	 she	 grabbed	 Talise	 by	 the	 wrist.	 “Come	 on,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	 said,	 pulling	 her	 down	 the	 hall.	 “They	 always	 check	 this	 closet,	 but	 I know	another	place	we	can	hide.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	you—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">Shhh! </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	clamped	her	mouth	shut	until	they	were	out	of	that	hallway	and	in	the guard’s	 hallway.	 When	 Wendy’s	 feet	 began	 to	 slow,	 Talise	 looked	 at	 her seriously.	“This	is	the	guard’s	hallway.	Where	the	 <i class="calibre3">guards</i>	check	in	and	get	their gear	and	everything.	We	can’t	hide	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	smirked.	“Yeah,	but	they	only	check	in	every	hour	on	the	hour.	This</p>
<p class="calibre1">place	is	empty	the	rest	of	the	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>“How	do	you	know	that?”	Talise	asked.	She	stared	at	her	friend’s	gentle	smile and	innocent	face.	“How	often	do	you	sneak	out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	Wendy	asked	as	she	put	a	hand	to	her	chest.	Somehow,	she	managed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	imbibe	each	of	her	words	with	a	sweetness	that	jarred	against	the	reality	of	the situation.	“I	never	sneak	out.	How	could	you	suggest	such	a	thing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 could	 only	 respond	 with	 a	 disbelieving	 chuckle.	 “Then	 what	 are	 you doing	right	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy’s	ears	turned	pink	as	she	looked	down	at	the	ground.	“That’s	different. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	to	go	to	the	bathroom.	I	hate	how	they	make	us	take	a	guard	escort.	I	never sneak	out	for	anything	else.”	Her	lips	squished	up	into	a	knot	as	she	looked	at	a nearby	wall.	“Well,	sometimes	I	do	sneak	into	the	kitchens.	But	only	because	the headmaster	forgets	to	feed	the	animals.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 looked	 up	 with	 a	 smile	 but	 then	 her	 ears	 turned	 pink	 again.	 Looking away,	she	said.	“Oh.	There	was	one	time	I	didn’t	turn	an	essay	in	on	time.	But	I finished	it	that	night,	so	I	snuck	into	the	teacher’s	classroom	and	put	my	essay	in the	pile.	But	that	was	only	one	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	wanted	to	laugh	hard,	but	since	the	guards	were	looking	for	them,	she had	to	keep	it	to	a	quiet	snicker.	“How	did	you	learn	what	the	guards	do	at	night? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	can’t	imagine	you	sneaking	out	enough	to	find	out.”	She	cocked	her	head	to	the side.	“Can	you	get	us	to	the	training	building?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	 nodded	 and	 glanced	 around	 a	 corner.	 She	 waved	 at	 Talise	 to	 follow her	 and	 then	 she	 said,	 “My	 brother,	 Cyrus,	 taught	 me	 everything.	 Do	 you remember	when	he	was	here	a	few	years	ago?	He	got	into	lots	of	trouble.	Once he	graduated,	he	thought	he’d	pass	his	legacy	on	to	me	I	guess.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	snicker	escaped	Talise’s	mouth,	but	she	quieted	it	when	Wendy	put	a finger	 to	 her	 lips.	 They	 were	 silent	 through	 a	 few	 more	 halls,	 and	 even	 more silent	through	the	gardens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 they	 reached	 the	 training	 building,	 they	 were	 so	 used	 to	 whispering, they	didn’t	even	notice	that	they	kept	it	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	do	you	have	to	train	anyway?”	Wendy	asked.	“Everyone	knows	you’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	to	win.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 closed	 her	 eyes	 as	 she	 filled	 her	 palms	 with	 fire.	 When	 a	 cold	 chill swept	into	the	room,	she	shaped	more	fire,	but	this	time	inside	of	herself.	Why couldn’t	she	do	that	during	her	demonstration?	Shaping	fire	inside	the	veins	was such	 a	 difficult	 skill,	 most	 students	 never	 learned	 it.	 Sadly,	 it	 wasn’t	 flashy enough	for	a	demonstration,	not	to	mention	Emperor	Flarius	would	have	no	way of	knowing	fire	actually	ran	through	her	veins. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>Putting	that	thought	aside,	Talise	focused	on	the	fire	in	her	palms.	She	shaped each	 of	 them	 to	 look	 like	 the	 long	 ribbons	 that	 were	 often	 used	 in	 air	 shaping demonstrations.	“It’s	Aaden,”	Talise	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	 settled	 into	 a	 corner	 of	 the	 room	 and	 pulled	 out	 a	 pastry	 she	 had hidden	in	her	robe.	At	the	mention	of	Aaden,	her	body	shivered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	going	to	do	a	fire	sculpture	for	his	demonstration.	I	saw	him	practicing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s	doing	cherry	trees,	and	he’s	going	to	make	cherry	blossoms	pop	out	of	the branches	after	he	shapes	the	tree.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever	 made	 Wendy	 shiver	 before	 seemed	 to	 float	 away.	 Her	 eyes	 went wide	 as	 she	 popped	 a	 piece	 of	 the	 pastry	 into	 her	 mouth.	 Then	 she	 shook	 her head.	“Are	you	sure	he’s	not	going	to	make	a	tree	that	sort	of	looks	bushy?	He can’t	really	make	cherry	blossoms	pop	out	of	the	branches.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 can,”	 Talise	 said	 as	 she	 shaped	 the	 fire	 ribbons	 through	 the	 air.	 She moved	 them	 the	 same	 as	 people	 often	 moved	 colorful	 ribbons	 with	 wind shaping.	 The	 ribbons	 curled	 and	 weaved	 as	 if	 a	 wind	 danced	 with	 them.	 She chose	this	demonstration	specifically	because	it	used	her	primary	element	of	fire, but	also	because	it	showed	that	she	knew	how	to	shape	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only	 someone	 talented	 with	 air	 shaping	 could	 understand	 the	 movements well	 enough	 to	 move	 fire	 in	 the	 same	 way.	 Except	 fire	 was	 harder	 to	 control. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many	 people	 in	 Kamdaria,	 the	 emperor	 included,	 believed	 fire	 was	 the	 most difficult	element	to	master.	This	demonstration	proved	she	could	shape	fire	with skill,	but	it	also	showed	off	another	element	she	knew	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	incredible,”	Wendy	said.	“Cherry	blossoms	popping	out	of	branches. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Fire</i>	cherry	blossoms.	And	fire	branches.	That’s	so	cool.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,”	Talise	said	with	a	frown.	“And	I	have	to	beat	him,	so	don’t	act	too impressed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,”	 Wendy	 said,	 softening	 her	 voice.	 She	 chewed	 her	 pastry	 slowly, watching	as	Talise	shaped	the	fire	around	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 moved	 one	 of	 the	 fire	 ribbons	 to	 look	 like	 a	 tornado,	 spinning	 down until	 it	 nearly	 kissed	 the	 ground.	 With	 the	 other	 ribbon,	 she	 made	 it	 whip	 and whirl	 above	 her	 head	 in	 waves.	 Two	 completely	 separate	 motions	 moving simultaneously.	It	was	impressive	by	anyone’s	standard.	But	was	it	enough? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	going	to	beat	you,”	Wendy	said.	Her	voice	was	so	quiet,	Talise	almost didn’t	 hear.	 She	 wanted	 to	 be	 angry,	 but	 Wendy’s	 words	 had	 been	 uttered	 with such	love,	the	anger	left	before	it	could	settle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 let	 her	 fires	 vanish	 before	 she	 dropped	 onto	 the	 floor.	 With	 her forehead	 buried	 in	 her	 palms,	 she	 said,	 “I’ve	 been	 training	 ten	 years	 for	 this. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>There	has	to	be	something	I	can	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 sat	 in	 silence	 long	 enough	 to	 hear	 a	 changing	 of	 the	 guard	 in	 the courtyard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Make	it	dangerous,”	Wendy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	looked	up	as	she	raised	an	eyebrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	 nodded.	 “Aaden	 might	 beat	 you	 with	 the	 detail	 of	 his	 sculpture,	 but everybody	loves	a	bit	of	danger.	It	will	make	you	impressive	in	a	different	way, and	it	will	make	you	memorable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise’s	head	bobbed	up	and	down	as	she	got	to	her	feet.	She	shaped	a	long ribbon	 of	 fire	 and	 swirled	 it	 around	 like	 a	 tornado.	 When	 it	 got	 closer	 to	 the ground,	she	turned	it	back	upward.	Before	she	could	reconsider,	she	held	her	arm out	straight	and	let	the	fire	ribbon	twist	around	her	arm.	The	heat	brought	a	line of	sweat	to	her	forehead,	but	it	didn’t	burn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly,	she	untwined	the	fire	ribbon	from	her	arm	and	let	it	twist	around	her leg.	She	had	to	keep	the	fire	farther	from	her	leg,	so	it	didn’t	burn	the	fabric.	The temperature	inside	her	raised	even	higher,	but	it	didn’t	stop	her	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	raised	both	hands	high	above	her	head	and	clasped	them	together.	Then</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	let	the	fire	ribbon	swirl	around	her	entire	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 she	 finally	 shaped	 the	 fire	 away,	 Wendy	 clapped	 with	 delight.	 “Now <i class="calibre3">that</i>	was	cool.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	pretty	hot,”	Talise	said,	wiping	the	sweat	from	her	forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Too	hot?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	a	shrug,	Talise	said,	“It	has	to	be	dangerous	to	be	impressive,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Talise	wiped	another	line	of	sweat	from	the	back	of	her	neck,	she	thought about	shaping	ice	into	her	veins.	The	thought	of	Mrs.	Dew’s	lesson	stopped	her in	her	tracks.	She	didn’t	need	her	fingers	breaking	off.	Especially	not	before	the competition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	maybe	she	could	pack	ice	in	her	pockets	and	rub	them	over	her	body	after the	competition.	Except	if	she	did	that,	the	ice	would	melt	in	her	pocket	during the	demonstration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	didn’t	matter.	She’d	think	of	something	and	make	sure	she	became	Master Shaper.	She’d	have	to	tell	Marmie	the	good	news. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>	</p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">DAYLIGHT	 STREAMED	 IN	 THROUGH	 THE	 WINDOW	 OF	 the	 training</p>
<p class="calibre1">room	 as	 Talise	 worked	 to	 improve	 her	 technique.	 The	 competition	 was	 only	 a week	away	now,	and	she’d	been	training	during	every	minute	of	her	spare	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 the	 fire	 ribbons	 got	 too	 close	 to	 her	 body,	 it	 would	 raise	 her	 internal temperature	just	like	a	fever.	But	she	needed	that	little	bit	of	danger	or	else	the demonstration	 wouldn’t	 be	 impressive	 enough.	 She’d	 written	 another	 letter	 to Marmie	all	about	her	new	plan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	one	would	work.	It	had	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	swirled	a	fire	ribbon	around	her	arm.	When	it	reached	her	shoulder,	she let	the	ribbon	grow	longer	so	it	could	then	swirl	around	her	torso,	and	down	one leg.	 A	 cool	 afternoon	 air	 drifted	 in	 through	 the	 training	 room	 door,	 which	 felt nice	on	her	heated	skin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	 when	 Talise	 made	 another	 fire	 ribbon	 spin	 around	 her	 from	 bottom	 to top,	 Mrs.	 Dew	 walked	 into	 the	 room.	 Talise	 hadn’t	 snuck	 in	 this	 time,	 but	 the sight	of	her	teacher	still	made	her	jump. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mrs.	Dew.”	Talise	stopped	shaping	immediately	as	she	lowered	her	head	in	a quick	bow.	“What	can	I	do	for	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	 her	 surprise,	 Mrs.	 Dew	 didn’t	 answer.	 Her	 face	 remained	 stoic	 as	 she pointed	 toward	 the	 little	 stools	 in	 the	 corner	 of	 the	 room.	 One	 thing	 did	 seem different	 though.	 The	 muscles	 around	 her	 eyes	 looked	 heavy	 as	 if	 something weighed	them	down.	It	made	Talise’s	hair	stand	on	end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	it?”	Talise	asked.	“What’s	wrong?”	Terror	flashed	through	her,	but the	 logical	 part	 of	 her	 brain	 tried	 to	 swat	 it	 away.	 Mrs.	 Dew	 always	 looked serious.	That	was	her	default.	This	expression	was	no	different	than	usual.	Still, something	 like	 doom	 seemed	 to	 settle	 into	 the	 walls.	 Something	 was	 wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	didn’t	know	how	she	knew	it,	but	she	knew	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	 Dew	 only	 pointed	 to	 the	 stools	 again.	 Without	 waiting	 for	 Talise,	 she lowered	herself	onto	the	nearest	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Terror	 gripped	 Talise	 by	 the	 insides,	 but	 she	 tried	 to	 squash	 it	 down.	 Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dew	 probably	 just	 wanted	 to	 see	 Talise’s	 demonstration.	 She’d	 been	 going around	to	the	other	students	giving	advice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	 matter	 how	 much	 her	 brain	 worked,	 by	 the	 time	 Talise	 sat	 down	 across</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>from	Mrs.	Dew,	she	knew	this	had	nothing	to	do	with	her	demonstration.	A	faint glisten	of	tears	sat	in	the	corner	of	Mrs.	Dew’s	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 the	 same	 time,	 a	 lump	 appeared	 in	 Talise’s	 throat.	 Her	 muscles	 suddenly couldn’t	be	relaxed,	no	matter	how	she	tried	to	soothe	them.	And	when	had	she started	breathing	so	quickly? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	happened?”	Talise	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 just	 received	 word,”	 Mrs.	 Dew	 said,	 suddenly	 staring	 at	 the	 ground.	 She gulped	and	held	her	lips	together	as	if	unable	to	force	them	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 rope	 of	 ice	 seemed	 to	 tighten	 around	 Talise’s	 heart.	 Her	 breathing	 got deeper,	 and	 her	 muscles	 got	 tighter.	 How	 many	 seconds	 had	 it	 been	 since	 Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dew	 entered	 the	 room?	 Ten?	 Twelve?	 It	 felt	 like	 a	 thousand.	 Not	 a	 thousand seconds,	but	a	thousand	hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	knew	what	was	coming.	She	 <i class="calibre3">knew</i>	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	how	could	she	know	it?	Mrs.	Dew	hadn’t	said	anything	about	it	yet.	This conversation	 could	 have	 been	 about	 anything.	 Talise	 tried	 to	 force	 her	 mind	 to consider	how	ridiculous	she	was	being.	Tried	and	failed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	mind	had	no	control	now.	She	was	being	led	by	her	thumping	heart	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	anxiety	that	seized	her	muscles.	No	longer	able	to	calm	herself,	she	held	her breath	waiting	for	Mrs.	Dew’s	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your,”	 Mrs.	 Dew	 said	 before	 she	 gulped	 again.	 “I	 just	 received	 word	 from one	of	the	guards.	Your…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	paused	again	as	if	the	words	were	too	much.	Too	heavy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Just	 say	 it</i>,	 Talise	 thought.  <i class="calibre3">I	 already	 know	 what	 you’re	 going	 to	 say,	 so	 just</i> <i class="calibre3">say	it</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Dew	closed	her	eyes	and	turned	away.	“Shyna	was	found	this	morning</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	a	neighbor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marmie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Apparently	she’s	been	sick	the	past	few	weeks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise’s	seizing	muscles	were	replaced	by	a	cold,	icy	grip.	No	more	thumping heart.	 It	 must	 have	 stopped.	 It	 had	 to	 have	 stopped.	 Because	 how	 could	 she	 be alive	when	Marmie…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 neighbor	 was	 there	 the	 night	 before.	 He	 said	 she	 fell	 asleep.	 When	 he came	back	in	the	morning…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	Talise	said.	It	was	all	she	could	think	to	say.	This	couldn’t	possibly	be real. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	passed	away	in	her	sleep.	She	probably	didn’t	feel	anything	at	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!”	Talise	shouted.	She	jumped	off	her	stool,	but	then	standing	there	didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>feel	any	better.	She	had	to	do	something.	She	had	to	move,	or	her	muscles	would explode. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	stool. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 kicked	 it	 over,	 but	 it	 wasn’t	 enough.	 She	 threw	 it	 across	 the	 room,	 but that	wasn’t	enough	either.	Grabbing	the	stool	again,	she	heaved	it	at	the	wall.	It needed	to	break.	Something	had	to	be	destroyed.	Something	needed	to	break	for the	impossibility	of	this	situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	stool	hit	the	wall,	it	bounced	to	the	ground	with	barely	even	a	dent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 let	 out	 a	 guttural	 scream	 and	 fireballs	 appeared	 in	 her	 hands.	 She	 didn’t really	mean	to	set	the	stool	on	fire,	but	at	the	same	time,	she	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon,	the	wooden	stool	had	burst	into	flames	atop	the	cement	floor.	The	wood cracked	 by	 the	 heat	 of	 the	 flames.	 Talise	 watched	 until	 the	 legs	 of	 the	 stools turned	black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	she	fell	to	the	ground	with	her	face	in	her	hands	and	wept. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sobs	 shook	 through	 her.	 The	 muscles	 inside	 had	 been	 weakened	 by	 the anxiety	that	gripped	them.	Her	heart	no	longer	beat,	it	only	fluttered.	For	some reason,	her	eyes	felt	tired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	tired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sorry,”	Mrs.	Dew	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 teacher	 had	 never	 been	 particularly	 comforting,	 but	 having	 her	 arm wrapped	around	Talise’s	shoulders	felt	nice.	Not	enough,	but	nice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	 Dew	 said	 nothing	 of	 the	 burning	 stool.	 Instead,	 she	 squeezed	 Talise’s shoulders	and	let	her	cry	as	long	as	she	needed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	took	longer	than	it	should	have. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	did	she	die?”	Talise	finally	asked.	Her	voice	sounded	like	the	croaking of	a	frog,	but	she	managed	to	get	the	words	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	her	sleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	nodded.	“Yes,	I	know	you	said	that,	but	what	did	she	die	of?	Why	was she	sick?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Dew	wet	her	lips	as	she	looked	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	a	lot	of	people	getting	it?	Is	the	sickness	spreading?	A	fever?	A	cough? </p>
<p class="calibre1">What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking	at	the	ground,	Mrs.	Dew	asked,	“Do	you	know	how	most	people	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Storm	die?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blood	 rushed	 through	 Talise’s	 ears	 as	 her	 heart	 pounded.	 Again,	 the	 world seemed	 to	 freeze	 while	 she	 was	 forced	 to	 deal	 with	 these	 awful	 truths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Malnourishment,”	 Talise	 whispered.	 The	 same	 thing	 that	 prevented	 people	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>the	 Storm	 from	 being	 able	 to	 shape	 was	 also	 the	 thing	 that	 usually	 took	 them away	forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Dew	nodded,	still	unable	to	make	eye	contact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	both	quiet,	watching	the	flames	around	the	stool	turn	to	embers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 have	 to	 go	 to	 the	 funeral,”	 Talise	 said.	 “I	 have	 to	 leave	 a	 mark	 on	 her gravestone.”	It	was	the	only	thing	she	could	do	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	 the	 time	 of	 Kamdar,	 the	 first	 emperor	 of	 Kamdaria,	 gravestones	 had been	marked	by	the	deceased’s	family	members.	The	simple	marks	honored	the person’s	 life	 and	 acted	 as	 symbols	 for	 the	 love	 their	 family	 members	 held	 for them.	 The	 more	 marks	 a	 grave	 had,	 the	 more	 honored	 that	 person	 was considered	to	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	had	just	enough	money	to	get	to	the	Storm.	Not	enough	to	get	back,	but Mrs.	Dew	or	the	school	might	help	with	that.	They	allowed	that	sort	of	thing	on occasion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	 it	 was	 reckless	 to	 spend	 a	 day	 of	 traveling	 this	 close	 to	 the competition,	but	Talise	didn’t	care.	She	needed	this.	She	had	to	say	goodbye.	She had	to	leave	a	mark	on	Marmie’s	grave	because	hers	would	be	the	only	mark	the grave	would	bear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	 course.	 We	 have	 funds	 for	 you.	 I’ll	 contact	 the	 city	 and	 find	 out	 when they	plan	to	do	the	funeral.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	city?”	Talise	looked	up	with	a	start. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	 Dew	 nodded.	 “Yes,	 the	 city	 is	 doing	 her	 funeral.”	 When	 Talise	 stared back	 at	 her,	 Mrs.	 Dew	 added,	 “She	 didn’t	 have	 any	 family	 in	 the	 Storm,	 did she?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	turned	away	as	she	wrapped	her	arms	around	her	stomach.	Shaking	her head,	she	said,	“No.	She	has	no	family	in	the	Storm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">And	whose	fault	is	that? </i>	she	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	dropped	her	head	into	her	palms	and	began	crying	again	as	if	she	had never	stopped.	At	this	rate,	she	might	never	stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	until	Marmie’s	grave	bore	her	mark. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>	</p>

<p class="calibre1">LETTERS. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	captured	the	essence	of	Marmie,	but	not	the	smell.	They	didn’t	hold	the soft	 edges	 of	 her	 wrinkled	 skin	 or	 the	 few	 gray	 strands	 in	 her	 hair.	 How	 many strands	of	gray	were	there	now? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 hadn’t	 seen	 Marmie	 in	 ten	 years.	 When	 she	 first	 joined	 the	 academy, the	one	thing	she	feared	most	was	forgetting	Marmie’s	face.	At	first,	it	took	no effort	at	all	to	recall	her	sparkly	smile	and	gray	eyes.	The	first	few	years,	it	was easy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	it	wasn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	she	wondered	if	she	had	imagined	that	freckle	under	Marmie’s	right	eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or	was	it	her	left?	Had	her	lips	been	full	or	thin?	She	never	thought	to	look	when she	was	younger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marmie	insisted	Talise	would	never	be	able	to	forget	her	as	long	as	she	loved her.	But	she	was	wrong.	She	loved	Marmie	with	more	heart	than	she	even	knew was	capable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	she	could	barely	remember	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 clutched	 the	 letters	 against	 her	 chest	 and	 breathed	 them	 in	 again, praying	for	even	the	hint	of	a	smell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	 course	 it	 never	 came.	 What	  <i class="calibre3">did</i>	 Marmie	 smell	 like?	 Now	 she’d	 never know.	At	the	funeral,	she’d	smell	like	embalming	fluid.	That	wasn’t	Marmie.	All Talise	would	really	get	was	to	see	Marmie’s	face	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	beautiful	face	that	had	sacrificed	everything,  <i class="calibre3">everything</i>	 for	 Talise	 to	 be here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why	did	fate	have	to	be	so	cruel	as	to	let	Marmie	see	Talise	get	so	close	to	the competition,	but	not	close	enough	to	win?	Talise	had	bought	Marmie	a	riverboat ticket	so	she	could	attend.	If	things	had	gone	according	to	plan,	Marmie	would have	had	one	full	day	of	food	and	rest.	It	would	have	been	the	best	she’d	felt	in years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	now	she	was	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sand	 seemed	 to	 scrape	 down	 Talise’s	 throat	 as	 she	 tried	 to	 swallow.	 She clutched	the	letters	to	her	chest	as	she	paced	across	her	bedroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>How	was	she	supposed	to	compete	like	this?	How	could	she	focus	now? </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	swallowed	again	and	brushed	an	errant	tear	from	her	cheek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	just	had	to	put	a	mark	on	Marmie’s	gravestone.	If	she	could	just	leave	a mark	on	the	gravestone,	then	she	could	focus	again.	Why	was	Mrs.	Dew	taking so	long	to	tell	her	when	the	funeral	would	be? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise’s	bedroom	door	opened	a	crack,	and	the	letters	flew	through	the	air	as she	wrenched	the	door	open.	Her	arms	sagged	at	her	sides	when	she	saw	Wendy in	the	doorway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 turned	 away	 and	 tucked	 a	 strand	 of	 chin-length	 black	 hair	 behind	 her ear.	“I	thought	you	were	Mrs.	Dew.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	weren’t	you	in	class	this	morning?”	Wendy	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gulping	seemed	like	a	good	way	to	subdue	the	frog	in	Talise’s	throat,	but	the sandpaper	feeling	only	got	worse.	Considering	how	much	she’d	been	crying,	it made	sense	that	her	throat	was	dry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 had	 a,	 uh…	 personal…”	 Why	 was	 she	 trying	 to	 be	 brave	 in	 front	 of Wendy?	 Wendy	 was	 her	 friend.	 But	 maybe	 if	 she	 could	 be	 brave	 in	 front	 of Wendy,	 she	 could	 be	 brave	 in	 front	 of	 everyone	 else	 too.	 “A	 personal	 issue,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	finished	with	a	curt	nod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy’s	 face	 had	 fallen.	 All	 the	 lighthearted	 laughter	 in	 her	 eyes	 had	 been replaced	 by	 a	 shroud	 of	 black.	 “What	 happened?”	 Her	 voice	 came	 out	 higher than	usual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	of	that	Talise	probably	could	have	handled.	But	then	Wendy	touched	her arm	 with	 fingers	 as	 cold	 as	 ice.	 In	 a	 voice	 barely	 above	 a	 whisper,	 she	 asked, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Marmie?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 floodgates	 released	 and	 tears	 fell	 down	 Talise’s	 cheeks	 in	 sheets	 before she	 could	 even	 nod.	 Gripping	 her	 arms	 tight	 around	 her	 stomach,	 she	 turned away.	She	felt	foolish	for	crying,	but	she	didn’t	know	why. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	emotion	boiled	inside	her	until	it	was	too	much.	She	threw	her	body	onto her	 bed	 and	 kicked	 her	 feet	 against	 the	 mattress	 as	 she	 sobbed.	 She	 felt	 like	 a child	throwing	a	tantrum,	but	it	didn’t	stop	her.	Nothing	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why	did	this	have	to	be	real?	Why	couldn’t	it	be	a	fairy	tale	where	she	gained some	magic	power	for	going	through	a	tragedy?	In	reality,	all	this	gave	her	was the	urge	to	curl	up	in	a	ball	and	never	face	the	world	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	she	couldn’t	even	keep	her	cool	around	her	best	friend,	what	chance	did	she have	around	the	rest	of	her	classmates?	Around	Mrs.	Dew? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Around	the	emperor? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	never	understand	or	forgive	her	for	letting	her	emotions	get	in	the	way</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>of	shaping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	had	sidled	next	to	Talise.	She	stroked	her	hair	and	let	her	cry.	Minutes passed	without	either	of	them	saying	a	word.	Or	maybe	it	was	hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 Talise	 knew	 was	 her	 shoulders	 still	 heaved	 with	 sobs,	 but	 no	 more	 tears fell	 from	 her	 eyes.	 Maybe	 she’d	 finally	 gotten	 too	 dehydrated.	 When	 the sandpaper	coating	her	throat	became	unbearable,	she	sat	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	sat	across	from	her	on	the	end	of	the	bed.	Were	those	tear	streaks	on her	cheeks	too? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 just,”	 Talise	 said	 as	 she	 started	 twisting	 a	 chunk	 of	 her	 hair	 with	 both hands.	“I	just	want	to	go	to	the	funeral	and	put	a	mark	on	Marmie’s	gravestone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	I	can	just	see	her	one	last	time,	if	I	can	just	say	goodbye,	I	know	I’ll	be	okay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ll	be	able	to	focus	on	the	competition	and	do	my	best	like	I	promised	her.	I	just need	to	put	mark	on	her	gravestone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	is	the	funeral?”	Wendy’s	voice	came	out	in	a	gentle	wisp,	floating	on the	air	like	an	air	shaping	ribbon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.	Mrs.	Dew	was	supposed	to	find	out,	but	she	doesn’t	know	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	said	the	city	is	taking	forever	to	write	back.	Or	maybe	the	letter	got	lost	in the	mail.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	Wendy’s	eyebrows	shot	up	for	a	brief	moment	before	it	fell	back	into place.	It	was	such	a	small	expression,	but	on	Wendy,	it	spoke	volumes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	 seemed	 to	 curl	 into	 herself.	 She	 shrugged	 her	 shoulders	 until	 they touched	her	earlobes.	“I’m	sure	it’s	nothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	sat	forward,	grabbing	one	of	Wendy’s	hands	until	it	was	tight	between both	of	hers.	“Please,	Wendy.	It’s	my…”	Her	throat	seemed	to	choke	up	before the	name	could	escape	her	lips.	In	a	whisper,	she	finished,	“What	do	you	know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy’s	 eyes	 were	 full	 to	 the	 brim	 with	 tears.	 A	 light	 flush	 colored	 her cheeks	 as	 she	 nodded.	 Maybe	 she	 had	 been	 trying	 to	 protect	 Talise	 from	 the truth,	but	she	understood	now.	Talise	needed	the	truth	more	than	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	Mrs.	Dew	already	knows	when	the	funeral	is.	I	heard	her	talking	to another	teacher.	I	don’t	know	when	it’s	supposed	to	be,	but	I	think	she’s	hiding something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	clasped	her	hands	over	her	mouth.	Her	stomach	seemed	to	solidify	into a	 knot	 with	 thousands	 of	 strands	 that	 grew	 tighter	 each	 second.	 “It’s	 the	 same day.	What	if	it’s	the	same	day	as	the	competition?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	wouldn’t	do	that,”	Wendy	said,	forcing	her	head	side	to	side	in	sharp jerks.	“They	wouldn’t	wait	that	long	to	do	the	funeral.	Especially	in	the	Storm. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>Have	you	ever	heard	of	them	waiting	an	entire	week	to	do	a	funeral?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	knot	in	her	stomach	loosened	one	strand	at	a	time.	“No.	No,	you’re	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Funerals	 in	 the	 Storm	 usually	 happen	 within	 three	 days.”	 With	 those	 words, another	strand	came	loose,	allowing	her	to	let	out	a	breath.	But	then,	it	recoiled, and	the	knot	seemed	even	tighter	than	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	then	why	hasn’t	Mrs.	Dew	told	me	when	it	is?	What	is	she	hiding?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	she	doesn’t	want	you	to	get	distracted	from	the	competition.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	let	out	a	snort.	“Too	late	for	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	money	a	problem?”	Wendy	asked.	Her	eyes	were	focused	on	her	fingers</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 she	 picked	 at	 her	 cuticles.	 “I	 have	 a	 little	 money	 in	 savings	 if	 you	 need	 a ticket.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	took	everything	in	her	for	Talise	to	keep	her	mouth	from	gaping.	This	was not	typical	for	their	relationship.	Wendy	was	from	the	Gate,	so	she	always	had more	money	than	Talise.	But	even	still,	Wendy	never	had	exorbitant	amounts	of money.	At	least	not	like	people	from	the	Crown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	 frog	 settled	 into	 Talise’s	 throat,	 though	 she	 couldn’t	 figure	 out exactly	why.	“Mrs.	Dew	said	the	school	might	pay	for	the	ticket.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	let	out	an	audible	breath	of	relief	that	was	probably	meant	to	be	silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	cheeks	turned	pink	for	a	moment	before	her	eyes	narrowed	at	a	spot	in	the floor.	“Something	weird	is	going	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	nodded	and	crossed	her	arms	over	her	chest.	She	wanted	to	scowl	too but	worried	Wendy	might	think	it	was	about	her.	For	now,	her	scowling	would have	to	stay	in	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	 twisted	 her	 hands	 around	 themselves	 before	 she	 spoke	 again.	 “My brother	told	me	he	used	to	bribe	guards	when	he	wanted	information.	You	know they	 hear	 everything.	 He	 told	 me	 who	 the	 trustworthy	 guards	 are,	 who	 can	 be bought,	and	who	gives	good	information.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	light	bloomed	in	Talise’s	heart	for	only	a	moment	before	it	was	snuffed	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t.	I	only	have	enough	money	for	my	riverboat	ticket.	If	the	school	doesn’t help,	I	don’t	have	anything	extra	for	bribery.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wasn’t	suggesting	you	pay	for	it,”	Wendy	said	in	a	matter-of-fact	tone.	She grabbed	 Talise’s	 wrist	 and	 pulled	 them	 both	 out	 the	 door	 before	 Talise	 could even	think	about	protesting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	led	them	out	into	the	gardens	where	they	hid	behind	a	particularly	stiff bush.	Prying	a	few	branches	apart,	Talise	looked	through	a	small	opening	in	the leaves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 guard	 stood	 in	 front	 of	 a	 fountain	 wearing	 a	 uniform	 covered	 in	 wrinkles</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>and	dirt	smudges.	One	of	the	older	guards	was	talking	to	him,	and	the	younger guard	didn’t	like	what	he	was	hearing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 moment	 the	 older	 guard	 stepped	 away,	 Wendy	 pulled	 them	 out	 from behind	the	bush	and	marched	toward	the	younger	guard.	He	didn’t	notice	them	at first	because	he	was	too	busy	grumbling	under	his	breath	and	digging	his	toe	into the	dirt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 they	 stood	 directly	 in	 front	 of	 him,	 he	 finally	 seemed	 to	 notice	 they were	 there	 for	 him.	 His	 toe	 stopped	 mid-dig	 as	 he	 looked	 up.	 He	 pasted	 on	 a cocky	smile	and	shook	his	hair	until	it	fell	into	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	then,	he	saw	Talise’s	face	and	everything	in	his	expression	changed.	First his	eyebrows	shot	up,	and	then	he	stuffed	his	hands	into	his	pockets.	After	a	tiny gulp,	his	cocky	expression	returned,	but	nothing	about	it	felt	natural	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	 did	 you	 make	 that	 face	 when	 you	 saw	 me?”	 Talise	 asked.	 “Did	 that guard	say	something	to	you	about	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!”	the	guard	said,	a	little	too	quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	 placed	 a	 hand	 on	 his	 forearm,	 and	 his	 shoulders	 seemed	 to	 relax instantly.	She	turned	her	eyes	downward	so	the	only	way	to	look	at	him	was	up through	 her	 eyelashes.	 “Do	 you	 know	 anything	 about	 a	 funeral	 for	 a	 woman named	Shyna?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guard	seemed	mesmerized	by	Wendy’s	honey-sweet	voice.	After	a	brief</p>
<p class="calibre1">blank	 stare,	 he	 shook	 his	 head	 and	 looked	 away.	 “No.	 I	 don’t	 know	 anything about	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	was	ready	to	grind	her	teeth	into	dust,	but	Wendy	seemed	to	welcome the	challenge.	She	bit	her	bottom	lip	and	touched	the	guard’s	forearm	again.	He was	 too	 busy	 staring	 into	 her	 eyes	 to	 notice	 she	 had	 retrieved	 a	 wad	 of	 money from	her	side	pouch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	now?”	she	said	with	a	playful	smirk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	eyed	the	money	for	a	long	second	but	then	looked	back	into	her	eyes.	And then	 back	 at	 the	 money.	 Without	 warning,	 he	 took	 a	 step	 back	 and	 raised	 his hands	 in	 front	 of	 himself.	 “I’m	 straight	 now.	 I	 don’t	 do	 that	 kind	 of	 thing anymore.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	let	out	a	soft	sigh	and	reached	back	into	her	side	pouch.	This	time,	an even	 bigger	 wad	 of	 money	 lay	 in	 her	 palm.	 Even	 Talise’s	 eyes	 widened	 at	 the sight	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 do	 you	 know?”	 Wendy	 asked.	 She	 probably	 meant	 for	 her	 voice	 to sound	serious	and	business-like,	but	she	was	too	sweet	for	it.	Instead,	it	sounded just	as	innocent	as	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>The	 guard	 showed	 a	 moment’s	 hesitation.	 After	 one	 last	 look	 into	 Wendy’s eyes,	 he	 leaned	 forward,	 keeping	 his	 head	 bent	 low.	 “The	 funeral	 is	 scheduled for	the	week	after	the	competition.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise’s	 fingers	 curled	 into	 a	 fist.	 “Try	 again,”	 she	 said.	 “That’s	 two	 weeks away.	They	would	never	wait	that	long	to	do	a	funeral.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	swear,”	the	guard	said,	placing	a	hand	over	his	heart	while	the	other	took the	 money.	 “I	 thought	 it	 was	 weird	 too,	 but	 they	 said	 they’re	 doing	 some embalming	thing	so	they	can	hold	off	until	then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 was	 still	 busy	 eyeing	 the	 guard,	 trying	 to	 decide	 if	 he	 was	 telling	 the truth	or	not,	when	Wendy	said,	“Thank	you.	You	don’t	know	what	this	means.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	sheepish	smile	grew	on	the	guard’s	lips	as	he	rustled	his	hair	with	one	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	still	didn’t	know	if	he	could	be	trusted,	but	then	again,	why	would	he	lie? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	made	sense	now.	Mrs.	Dew	didn’t	want	to	say	when	the	funeral	was because	she	wanted	Talise	to	focus	on	the	competition	without	worrying	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	postponed	the	funeral	to	make	sure	Talise	could	be	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	all	made	sense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	still,	the	curling	knot	of	anxiety	in	her	stomach	only	seemed	to	twist	and tighten	at	the	thought.	Could	she	focus	on	the	competition	even	with	the	funeral postponed? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">TEN</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">THE	CLASSROOM	LOOKED	NOTHING	LIKE	IT	USUALLY	did.	The	desks</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	chairs	had	all	been	pushed	against	the	walls,	so	the	floor	was	wide	open.	The students	sat	cross-legged	at	the	back	of	the	classroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	 Dew	 and	 four	 other	 shapers	 from	 the	 Crown	 sat	 at	 a	 long	 table	 in	 the front.	 They	 each	 held	 a	 writing	 pad	 and	 kept	 whispering	 to	 each	 other.	 They didn’t	seem	to	be	concerned	in	the	least	that	their	whispers	increased	the	tension in	the	room	by	ten	times.	In	fact,	a	few	of	them	seemed	to	enjoy	the	affect	they had	on	the	students. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pre-competition	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Competition	day	was	most	important	to	Talise,	but	for	almost	everyone	else, this	 was	 the	 day	 they’d	 been	 training	 ten	 years	 for.	 Mrs.	 Dew	 and	 the	 fellow judges	 would	 make	 notes	 on	 the	 demonstrations	 and	 those	 notes	 would ultimately	 help	 place	 the	 students	 into	 their	 future	 jobs.	 Plus,	 it	 gave	 anyone vying	for	Master	Shaper	the	chance	to	see	each	other’s	demonstrations	and	alter theirs	to	better	compete. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	competition	day,	the	only	judge	would	be	the	emperor.	He	would	choose</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	best	shaper	as	Master	Shaper.	Everyone	already	knew	there	were	really	only two	students	who	had	a	chance	at	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	pre-competition	day? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	 had	 a	 chance	 here.	 For	 everyone	 besides	 Talise	 and	 Aaden,	 today was	 the	 day	 their	 lives	 would	 be	 set.	 They	 had	 to	 show	 the	 very	 best	 of	 their skills,	and	they	had	to	do	it	without	throwing	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 dug	 her	 fingernails	 into	 her	 knees,	 trying	 to	 keep	 her	 mind	 occupied with	 anything	 besides	 Marmie’s	 funeral.	 She	 should	 have	 been	 more	 worried about	 Aaden	 and	 seeing	 his	 skills,	 but	 all	 she	 could	 see	 in	 her	 mind	 was Marmie’s	empty	gravestone	until	Talise	would	be	able	to	put	one	tiny	mark	on	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	mark	that	would	look	so	little	compared	to	the	life	that	Marmie	had	led. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	sacrifice	and	love	deserved	a	hundred	marks.	The	only	thing	Talise	could	do now	was	make	her	mark	so	intricate	and	detailed	that	it	would	be	marveled	by all	who	saw	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	 jumped	 to	 the	 center	 of	 the	 room	 when	 Mrs.	 Dew	 called	 her	 name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 dug	 her	 nails	 deeper	 into	 her	 knees.	 She	 needed	 to	 focus	 on	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>demonstration.	She	owed	it	to	Wendy	to	pay	attention	at	least	to	hers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	 time	 Talise’s	 mind	 would	 wander	 to	 Marmie’s	 grave,	 she’d	 press	 her nails	 in	 deeper.	 Her	 mind	 still	 fought	 to	 dwell	 on	 the	 grave	 even	 while	 Wendy asked	for	the	classroom	windows	to	be	opened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 other	 judges	 looked	 bored,	 but	 Mrs.	 Dew	 gave	 Wendy	 an	 encouraging nod.	 Wendy	 lifted	 her	 bow	 and	 a	 single	 arrow	 from	 the	 ground.	 She	 took	 aim before	shooting,	but	her	demonstration	began	after	the	arrow	left	the	bow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	dropped	the	bow	and	put	both	hands	in	front	of	her,	sending	a	rush	of shaped	air	after	the	arrow.	With	the	added	air,	the	arrow	was	able	to	travel	three times	the	distance	it	could	have	without	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	judges	were	impressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	was	proud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	then	the	judges	asked	too	many	questions,	especially	one	judge	wearing red	 silk.	 He	 asked	 about	 the	 military	 application	 of	 her	 shaping	 technique,	 and Talise’s	head	was	filled	with	thoughts	of	Marmie	once	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Aaden’s	turn	came,	she	could	barely	keep	herself	from	losing	the	food in	her	stomach.	He	had	improved	his	cherry	blossoms	to	perfection.	Even	from the	back	of	the	classroom	she	could	see	how	beautiful	they	were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	stomach	roiled	and	clenched	as	she	watched.	No	amount	of	nail	pressing would	 help	 her	 insides	 now.	 When	 she	 was	 called	 up	 to	 do	 her	 demonstration, she	already	had	a	headache	and	her	skin	seemed	to	be	on	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’d	been	practicing	with	so	much	fire	lately,	she	didn’t	notice	her	internal temperature	 rising	 so	 much.	 But	 this	 time,	 she	 was	 pretty	 sure	 it	 was	 an	 actual fever,	not	from	fire	shaping.	A	stress-induced	fever	no	doubt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	if	she	lost	her	lunch	in	front	of	the	judges,	they	would	let	her	do	her demonstration	another	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	wouldn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 already	 knew	 they	 wouldn’t.	 It	 wouldn’t	 do	 her	 any	 good	 even	 if	 they did.	Marmie’s	funeral	was	still	an	entire	week	after	the	final	competition.	How could	she	concentrate	on	anything	before	then? </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 shaped	 her	 fire	 ribbons	 into	 the	 air	 and	 let	 them	 spin	 around	 her.	 Her veins	 protested	 at	 every	 second.	 Her	 temperature	 was	 rising	 much	 more	 than	 it ever	 had	 in	 practice.	 She	 gritted	 her	 teeth	 together	 and	 tried	 to	 think	 of something	that	would	encourage	her.	She	tried	to	think	of	Marmie’s	sacrifice	and how	she	couldn’t	let	it	be	in	vain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 a	 fire	 ribbon	 high	 above	 her	 head,	 an	 image	 of	 Marmie	 came	 into Talise’s	head	so	clearly,	it	was	as	if	Marmie	sat	next	to	her.	Talise	remembered</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>sitting	in	that	little	room	where	she’d	been	tested	for	a	shaping	academy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	had	asked	if	Marmie	could	come	live	in	the	palace	after	Talise	became Master	Shaper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	already	know	the	answer	to	that,”	Marmie	had	said	in	a	gentle	tone.	Her right	 eye	 had	 squinted,	 almost	 in	 a	 wink.	 The	 freckle	 under	 her	 eye	 bounced through	the	movement.	So,	the	freckle	 <i class="calibre3">was</i>	under	her	right	eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 a	 moment,	 Talise’s	 heart	 soared	 with	 relief.	 She	 could	 see	 the	 face	 with perfect	 clarity.	 It	 felt	 as	 though	 Marmie	 looked	 down	 on	 her,	 offering	 love	 and approval	through	her	memory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	then	reality	settled	in	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marmie	was	dead.	Gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 that	 moment,	 everything	 fell	 apart.	 When	 the	 fire	 ribbon	 fell,	 Talise’s shaping	became	jerky	and	rigid.	Instead	of	falling	in	a	swooping	swirl,	it	looked more	like	a	snake	slithering	down	a	spiral	staircase,	and	not	in	a	graceful	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 managed	 to	 regain	 control	 when	 the	 fire	 ribbon	 reached	 her	 shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	spun	the	ribbon	around	her	body	just	like	she	had	practiced	all	those	times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	still,	when	the	ribbon	swirled	around	her	ankles,	she	shaped	it	too	close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 skin	 over	 her	 ankle	 bone	 tingled	 with	 a	 burn,	 and	 the	 hem	 of	 her	 pants had	probably	been	singed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	care. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	tried	to;	she	really	did.	How	could	she	be	so	careless	with	the	competition so	 close?	 She	 needed	 to	 know	 if	 her	 demonstration	 was	 good	 enough	 to	 beat Aaden’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	how	could	she	care	about	anything	when	Marmie	was	dead? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	senses	seemed	to	sharpen	at	the	thought	of	Aaden.	He	was	an	impressive shaper.	She	needed	to	beat	him.	All	this	moping	wouldn’t	do	her	any	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	lifted	her	chin	in	the	air	and	attempted	a	smile	at	the	judges.  <i class="calibre3">Be	brave</i>, she	thought.  <i class="calibre3">That’s	what	Marmie	would	want</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 ended	 her	 demonstration	 with	 one	 fire	 ribbon	 twisting	 around	 her	 arms and	another	twisting	around	her	legs.	They	joined	together	around	her	waist	only to	sprout	several	new	ribbons	that	shot	out	from	her	body	like	a	firework. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	rest	of	the	demonstration	was	flawless	just	like	all	of	it	should	have	been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Talise	bowed	to	the	judges,	she	noticed	one	of	them	was	still	gaping	at her.	Mrs.	Dew	looked	smug	as	she	glanced	at	that	judge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	walk	to	the	back	of	the	room	seemed	longer	than	it	should	have.	It	was made	a	little	easier	when	Talise	recognized	a	glint	of	fear	in	Aden’s	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a> <i class="calibre3">Good</i>.	He	deserved	to	be	as	worried	as	he	had	made	her	feel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	 looked	 delighted	 when	 Talise	 sat	 down	 next	 to	 her.	 “Very	 cool,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	said	under	her	breath.	She	paired	the	words	with	an	encouraging	nod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	lifted	Talise’s	spirits.	Not	a	lot,	but	when	she	was	feeling	so	low,	a	little made	a	big	difference. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 judges	 began	 whispering	 as	 they	 compared	 their	 notes.	 Mrs.	 Dew	 had chosen	 Talise	 to	 go	 last	 because	 she	 knew	 it	 would	 be	 an	 impressive demonstration.	 Of	 course,	 it	 looked	 better	 for	 Mrs.	 Dew	 if	 one	 of	 her	 students won	 Master	 Shaper.	 That	 was	 how	 she	 kept	 her	 spot	 at	 the	 elite	 academy	 year after	year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 whispering	 among	 the	 judges	 lasted	 too	 long.	 Despite	 their	 years	 of studying	patience	and	discipline,	every	single	one	of	the	students	was	fidgeting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aaden	kept	glancing	over	at	Talise,	but	then	his	eyes	would	flick	away,	and he’d	try	to	pretend	like	he	had	never	looked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 nervousness	 probably	 shouldn’t	 have	 made	 her	 feel	 so	 good,	 but	 she couldn’t	help	it.	Whenever	his	eyes	flicked,	a	shot	of	glee	danced	through	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	did	feel	a	 <i class="calibre3">little</i>	guilty,	but	this	was	for	Marmie	and	Marmie	wanted	her	to win. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	several	more	minutes	of	biting	her	bottom	lip	and	checking	the	hem	of her	pants—which	had	been	singed—the	judges	announced	that	they	had	made	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">decision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	wearing	red	silk	stood	from	the	judges	table.	He	held	a	thick	stack of	 papers	 which	 would	 determine	 job	 placements	 for	 all	 the	 students.	 With	 a good	 recommendation	 from	 pre-competition	 day,	 even	 someone	 from	 the	 Gate could	get	a	job	in	the	palace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 not	 someone	 from	 the	 Storm.	 The	 only	 way	 someone	 could	 escape	 the Storm	 was	 by	 winning	 Master	 Shaper.	 Which	 meant	 Talise	 didn’t	 care	 one	 bit about	 the	 stack	 of	 papers	 in	 the	 man’s	 hand.	 She	 only	 cared	 about	 the	 words ready	 to	 spill	 from	 his	 mouth.	 Now	 she’d	 know	 once	 and	 for	 all	 if	 her demonstration	was	good	enough	to	beat	Aaden’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	are	most	impressed,”	the	man	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	a	good	sign.	Talise	noticed	the	man	wore	a	silver	pin	engraved	with a	 miniature	 tornado.	 The	 silver	 pin	 meant	 he	 worked	 at	 the	 palace	 and	 the tornado	 meant	 air	 was	 his	 primary	 element.	 He	 wasn’t	 a	 Master	 Shaper,	 or	 his pin	would	have	been	engraved	with	the	symbols	for	all	four	elements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	wracked	her	brain,	trying	to	think	if	she	knew	of	any	air	shapers	from the	 palace	 important	 enough	 to	 come	 to	 pre-competition	 day.	 Like	 all	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>students,	 she	 had	 been	 disappointed	 that	 no	 Master	 Shapers	 had	 come.	 They usually	had	at	least	one	for	pre-competition	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	still,	this	man	had	to	have	a	high	level	of	authority	to	be	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">General	Gale	Asato.	It	came	to	her	suddenly	as	he	opened	his	mouth	to	speak again.	 No	 wonder	 he	 had	 been	 so	 intrigued	 by	 Wendy’s	 demonstration.	 He oversaw	shape	training	for	all	military	personnel,	especially	the	royal	guard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never	 before	 have	 we	 seen	 shaping	 like	 we	 saw	 today.	 Mrs.	 Dew	 truly deserves	a	promotion	after	what	she	has	helped	you	achieve.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Dew’s	cheeks	turned	pink	and	General	Gate	gave	her	the	barest	hint	of	a wink.	 He	 licked	 his	 lips	 before	 he	 continued.	 “The	 winner	 for	 today	 was	 most difficult	to	choose.	Not	all	the	judges	agreed	on	the	same	student.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	paused,	seeming	to	hold	his	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Just	 say	 it</i>!	 With	 the	 added	 anxiety	 running	 through	 her,	 Talise	 suddenly remembered	her	fever.	She	wanted	nothing	more	than	to	lie	down.	And	to	win	of course. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aaden	is	our	winner	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise’s	mouth	dropped	open	at	the	words.	Wendy	let	out	a	small	gasp.	Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dew	frowned	at	the	table.	Every	pair	of	eyes	in	the	room	seemed	to	wander	over to	 Talise.	 Claye	 gave	 her	 an	 apologetic	 look	 before	 he	 glanced	 at	 Wendy	 and shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 fever	 inside	 Talise	 seemed	 to	 explode	 through	 her	 skin	 while	 a	 deep shiver	ran	through	every	part	of	her	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 teeth	 rattled,	 and	 she	 had	 to	 clench	 them	 together.	 Tears	 threatened	 to spill	over	her	eyelashes,	but	she	managed	to	hold	them	back.	The	last	thing	she wanted	was	to	start	crying	in	front	of	the	judges. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	probably	would	have	held	it	together	too.	She	was	strong.	She	had	been through	a	lot.	Yes,	Marmie	had	just	died,	and	she	was	devastated.	But	still,	Talise wasn’t	one	to	burst	into	tears	with	a	roomful	of	eyes	on	her.	She	 <i class="calibre3">could</i>	have	held it	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Except	then	Aaden	looked	at	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	didn’t	even	matter	what	expression	he	wore	because	his	stupid	face	was	the reason	 the	 past	 ten	 years	 meant	 nothing.	 The	 reason	 Marmie’s	 death	 meant nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	dared	to	make	eye	contact,	and	she	lost	all	semblance	of	control.	Her	body seemed	to	detach	itself	from	her	mind,	so	she	had	no	control	over	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Springing	to	her	feet,	her	legs	propelled	her	out	of	the	classroom,	as	far	from Aaden	as	she	could	get. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">ELEVEN</p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">TALISE	 HUGGED	 THE	 WOODEN	 GATE	 THAT	 SEPARATED	 the	 academy</p>
<p class="calibre1">grounds	 from	 the	 palace	 graveyard.	 Without	 a	 pass,	 she	 wasn’t	 permitted	 to leave	the	school	grounds.	And	she’d	never	gotten	a	pass	because	she’d	never	had enough	money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	her	spot	behind	the	gate,	she	could	just	make	out	the	marks	on	the	late empress’s	grave.	Isla	Tempest	Malksur	Ruemon	had	one	thousand	three	hundred and	twelve	marks	on	her	grave.	Talise	had	counted	them	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many	citizens	of	Kamdaria	had	come	to	her	funeral	and	been	invited	to	leave a	mark	on	her	grave.	Marks	were	usually	reserved	for	family	members	only,	but as	empress,	Isla	Ruemon	was	considered	family	to	all	of	Kamdaria. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 couldn’t	 bring	 herself	 to	 have	 bitterness	 toward	 the	 late	 empress.	 Isla had	been	murdered	in	cold	blood	after	all.	But	why	did	Empress	Isla	get	over	a thousand	 marks	 when	 Marmie	 would	 only	 get	 one?	 One	 mark	 was	 a	 disgrace, even	if	it	was	an	intricate	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	crunch	of	gravel	made	Talise	jump,	but	she	relaxed	immediately	when	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard	Wendy’s	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	I’d	find	you	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	didn’t	have	to	wipe	any	tears	before	she	turned	around.	Maybe	rushing from	 the	 classroom	 had	 dried	 them	 all	 up.	 No	 matter	 how	 she	 stared	 at	 the graveyard,	 they	 stayed	 back,	 stealing	 the	 emotional	 release	 that	 tears	 usually provided. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 did	 they	 say	 after	 I	 left?”	 Talise	 asked.	 She	 hoped	 Wendy	 wouldn’t guess	that	 <i class="calibre3">they</i>	really	just	meant	Aaden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing,”	Wendy	said	in	her	usual	timid	voice.	“No	one	said	a	single	thing, and	Mrs.	Dew	looked	at	them	all	really	sternly	in	case	they	were	thinking	about it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	tried	to	smile.	She	was	grateful	Wendy	had	come	for	her.	She	was	even grateful	Mrs.	Dew	had	given	stern	glares. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	does	your	recommendation	say?”	Talise	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy’s	eyes	lit	up	with	a	grin.	“I’ve	been	recommended	for	military	shape training.	General	Gale	wants	to	work	with	me	himself.”	Her	smile	looked	too	big for	her	face	and	somehow,	it	made	her	look	even	sweeter	than	ever. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>“You	deserve	it,”	Talise	said.	Her	words	had	never	been	more	sincere,	but	that didn’t	stop	her	from	choking	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	Talise,”	Wendy	said,	throwing	her	arms	around	her.	“You’re	still	going	to win;	I	know	you	will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	opened	her	mouth	to	speak.	Sniffed.	Felt	tears	welling	in	her	eyes.	And closed	her	mouth	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	 hugged	 tighter,	 seeming	 to	 sense	 her	 distress.	 “You	 were	 just distracted	because	of	Marmie’s	funeral,	and	it	made	you	mess	up	in	the	middle of	your	demonstration.	You’ll	be	more	focused	on	competition	day.	You’re	going to	win.	Then,	when	you	visit	Marmie’s	grave,	you’ll	be	a	Master	Shaper,	and	you can	leave	four	marks	on	her	grave.	One	for	each	element.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 tears	 subsided	 for	 a	 moment	 as	 Wendy’s	 words	 sunk	 in.	 Talise	 had forgotten	 Master	 Shapers	 were	 allowed	 to	 leave	 four	 marks.	 That	 lifted	 her spirits	slightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	really	think	I	have	a	chance?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	pulled	away	and	nodded	emphatically.	“You	only	messed	up	because</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	were	thinking	about	Marmie,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See?	Then	you	still	have	a	chance	for	sure.	We	all	saw	when	you	messed	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 rest	 of	 your	 demonstration	 was	 perfect	 except	 that	 one	 part.	 Even	 General Gale	said	the	judges	were	divided	on	who	should	win.	On	competition	day,	the emperor	 is	 the	 only	 one	 who	 matters.	 As	 long	 as	  <i class="calibre3">he</i>	 likes	 your	 demonstration better,	it	doesn’t	matter	what	happened	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	wrapped	a	hand	around	her	elbow	and	pulled	it	close	to	her	body.	What if	 the	 emperor	 liked	 fire	 cherry	 blossoms	 more	 than	 fire	 ribbons?	 Talise	 was almost	 certain	 he	 would.	 Ridgerock	 Palace	 was	 known	 for	 its	 cherry	 blossoms and	 the	 emperor	 loved	 them.	 How	 could	 he	 appreciate	 dancing	 ribbons	 more than	 his	 favorite	 trees?	 The	 only	 thing	 he	 liked	 better	 than	 those	 blossoms	 was his	crown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	skin	seems	warmer	than	usual.	Is	that	still	from	the	demonstration?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um,”	Talise	pulled	her	elbow	even	closer	to	her	body.	“Yes,”	she	lied.	The fever	inside	her	had	been	growing	worse,	but	she	chose	to	ignore	it.	If	she	didn’t get	some	rest	soon,	it	would	become	an	even	bigger	problem.	One	she	couldn’t deal	with	at	the	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on.	Let’s	get	you	to	the	kitchen	so	we	can	get	some	ice	to	cool	your body.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	allowed	Wendy	to	tug	her	along.	As	they	walked,	Talise	glanced	back</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>at	Empress	Isla’s	grave.	Even	with	over	a	thousand	marks,	it	still	looked	sad.	So many	strangers	had	left	marks	that	the	ones	from	her	real	family	members	were impossible	 to	 spot.	 The	 memory	 of	 them	 seemed	 to	 be	 buried	 along	 with	 the empress	herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	walk	to	the	kitchen	building	seemed	longer	than	usual.	At	first,	Wendy’s presence	had	been	welcome,	but	now	Talise	wanted	to	be	alone.	Her	mind	was wrestling	with	too	many	things	at	once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Could	 her	 fire	 ribbons	 beat	 Aaden’s	 cherry	 trees?	 Did	 she	 even	 care	 when Marmie’s	death	was	so	fresh?	How	could	she	not	care	when	Marmie	had	died	to get	 her	 this	 far?	 How	 should	 the	 mark	 look	 that	 she	 would	 leave	 on	 Marmie’s gravestone? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy’s	 chatter	 kept	 interrupting	 her	 thoughts	 and	 each	 time	 it	 felt	 more intrusive.	When	they	reached	the	kitchen	building,	she	told	Wendy	to	go	on	and get	the	ice	while	she	stayed	outside.	She	needed	a	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	 she	 really	 needed	 was	 for	 Marmie	 to	 be	 alive	 and	 all	 this	 to	 be	 a horrible	nightmare,	but	Talise	didn’t	think	that	would	happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	pinched	herself	just	to	be	sure.	The	pain	brought	a	scowl	to	her	face	that only	deepened	when	Aaden	appeared	in	front	of	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	blinked	as	his	chest	rose	and	fell	against	his	fire	orange	tunic.	It	took	her	a moment	to	realize	why	that	seemed	so	strange.	Aaden	was	out	of	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 stared	 at	 her	 like	 he	 had	 found	 what	 he	 was	 looking	 for.	 And	 yet,	 his shoulders	 pulled	 back	 as	 if	 unsure	 whether	 being	 in	 her	 presence	 was	 what	 he really	wanted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	eyed	him	carefully,	hoping	her	gaze	would	make	him	squirm	like	he	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	her	demonstration.	Sadly,	her	gaze	seemed	to	have	no	such	effect	on	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	worse,	he	took	a	step	toward	her	with	his	shoulders	rolling	forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	demonstration	was	impressive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	curled	her	lip	into	a	snarl	and	jerked	herself	away	from	him.	“I	don’t need	your	pity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aaden	 let	 out	 a	 sigh	 and	 glanced	 over	 his	 shoulder	 at	 the	 instructional building.	 It	 may	 have	 been	 her	 imagination,	 but	 he	 seemed	 to	 focus	 on	 the window	to	Mrs.	Dew’s	office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 he	 turned	 back,	 he	 shrugged,	 and	 a	 look	 of	 resignation	 fell	 over	 his features.	“Look,	I’m	glad	I	won,	and	you	lost.	I	won’t	deny	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	clenched	her	teeth	as	a	hot	anger	boiled	from	her	toes	all	the	way	up	to her	bobbed	hair.	“Is	this	your	way	of	trying	to	make	me	feel	better?	Because	if	it is,	you’re	failing	miserably.	And	don’t	think	I’m	only	upset	about	losing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>“I	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	time,	she	took	a	step	toward	him.	It	took	everything	in	her	not	to	slap	his smug	 face.	 She	 crossed	 her	 arms	 over	 her	 chest	 to	 keep	 them	 from	 acting	 on their	own.	“My	Marmie	died	and	I	just	want	to	put	a	mark	on	her	grave,	but	the funeral	 isn’t	 until	 a	 week	 after	 the	 competition.	 I’m	 having	 a	 hard	 time concentrating.	It	has	nothing	to	do	with	you.  <i class="calibre3">Nothing</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Marmie?”	His	voice	sounded	hollow.	When	she	braved	a	glance	toward	him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">his	face	looked	hollow	too.	Gray	and	ice	seemed	to	spread	through	his	skin	as	he looked	 at	 her.	 The	 question	 sizzled	 in	 his	 eyes,	 almost	 begging	 to	 be contradicted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	turned	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	wouldn’t	do	at	all.	She	liked	being	angry	with	him	much	better.	As	she had	said	earlier,	she	didn’t	want	his	pity.	It	only	made	her	feel	pathetic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	something	I	think	you	should	know,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	she	could	ask	what	he	meant,	he	turned	and	waved	at	her	to	follow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 glared	 at	 his	 back,	 trying	 to	 decide	 if	 she	 should.	 He	 was	 probably	 just trying	 to	 mess	 with	 her	 head.	 He	 was	 probably	 trying	 to	 ensure	 that	 she	 failed when	they	did	their	demonstrations	for	the	emperor	next	week. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	a	tiny	piece	of	her,	way	down	in	her	gut,	trusted	him.	She	planted	her	feet and	 scolded	 that	 tiny	 spark	 in	 her	 gut.	 What	 did	 it	 know?	 How	 could	 she	 trust him?  <i class="calibre3">Him</i>? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aaden	 kept	 marching	 on,	 and	 it	 became	 clear	 he	 wouldn’t	 ask	 her	 again.	 If she	 wanted	 to	 know	 whatever	 mysterious	 information	 he	 thought	 she	 needed, this	was	her	last	chance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	spark	in	her	gut	seemed	to	make	the	decision	for	her.	She	sprang	forward, rushing	to	catch	up	with	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stopped	directly	under	the	window	to	Mrs.	Dew’s	office.	Pressing	a	finger to	 his	 lips,	 he	 pulled	 the	 window	 out	 so	 the	 sound	 from	 inside	 drifted	 out	 to them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	did	you	say	to	her	exactly?”	Mrs.	Dew	didn’t	sound	happy.	She	wasn’t the	sunshine	and	roses	type,	but	this	seemed	even	more	serious	than	usual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	doesn’t	know.	I	swear	on	the	emperor,	I	didn’t	give	anything	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	owner	of	the	second	voice	was	harder	to	place.	Talise	recognized	it	but couldn’t	remember	from	where. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	have	your	guard	status	revoked	if	you	try	to	sidestep	my	question	again!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Dew	shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	wasn’t	until	the	guard	replied	that	Talise	finally	placed	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>“I	told	her	the	funeral	would	be	a	week	 <i class="calibre3">after</i>	the	competition.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Dew	scoffed.	“She	would	never	believe	that.	She	isn’t	stupid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise’s	 gut	 started	 thrashing	 inside	 her,	 pinging	 off	 all	 sorts	 of	 warning signals	to	her	brain.	Why	 <i class="calibre3">had</i>	she	believed	it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 very	 convincing,”	 the	 guard	 said,	 and	 she	 imagined	 that	 he	 wore	 a charming	smile	as	he	said	it.	“Trust	me,	she	still	has	no	idea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 don’t	 understand	 what	 will	 happen	 if	 she	 loses.	 Talise	 needs	 to	 win.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Mrs.	Dew	spoke	again,	it	sounded	like	her	jaw	was	clenched.	“If	she	finds out	the	funeral	is	the	same	day	as	the	competition,	she’ll	lose	for	sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guard	said	something	in	reply,	but	Talise	didn’t	hear	it.	She	was	too	busy unraveling	from	the	inside	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The	same	day? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 pressed	 her	 back	 against	 the	 wall	 of	 the	 building	 as	 she	 sunk	 to	 the gravel.	Her	knees	were	pulled	up	to	her	chest,	and	her	chin	rested	on	top	before she	dared	take	a	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Why? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Why	hadn’t	Mrs.	Dew	told	her	from	the	beginning?	Why	had	the	guard	lied? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why	did	Marmie	have	to	die	this	close	to	the	competition? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 shiver	 ran	 up	 her	 spine	 thanks	 to	 her	 fever.	 Anger	 jabbed	 her	 in	 the stomach,	and	then	it	stabbed	her	in	the	chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aaden	shifted	on	the	gravel	once	he	closed	the	window.	She	wasn’t	angry	at him.	How	could	she	be	when	none	of	this	was	his	fault? </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 he	 was	 nearest,	 and	 the	 anger	 inside	 her	 was	 slamming	 against	 her insides,	desperate	to	spring	on	anyone	or	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 disgust	 me.”	 Her	 voice	 sounded	 more	 like	 the	 hiss	 of	 a	 snake	 than	 a human.	“You	only	brought	me	here	to	make	sure	I’d	lose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aaden	looked	mortified	by	the	mere	suggestion.	It	didn’t	matter	if	she	didn’t believe	her	own	words	or	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hate	you,”	Talise	said,	and	for	a	moment,	she	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aaden	gave	her	one	last	glance	before	he	stalked	away.	The	glance	held	not even	a	shred	of	pity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 stomach	 dropped.	 Now	 her	 anger	 had	 nothing	 to	 latch	 itself	 to.	 This wouldn’t	do	at	all.	This	was	too	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People	 in	 Kamdaria	 said	 that	 life	 wouldn’t	 give	 you	 anything	 you	 weren’t capable	of	handling.	But	they	were	wrong.	She’d	seen	it	in	the	Storm	and	now she	felt	it	firsthand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	she	could	do	was	give	up	because	this	was	too	hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>How	 could	 she	 possibly	 choose	 between	 Marmie’s	 funeral	 and	 the competition? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">TWELVE</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">IT	 DIDN’T	 TAKE	 TALISE	 LONG	 TO	 PACK	 her	 belongings.	 Just	 one	 extra dress,	 a	 handful	 of	 toiletries,	 and	 a	 stack	 of	 letters	 from	 Marmie.	 Her	 tote	 bag had	long	since	been	lost,	but	a	pillowcase	worked	just	as	well	to	carry	her	things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	running	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Forget	the	competition.	It	had	brought	her	nothing	but	anxiety	anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hours	had	passed	since	the	pre-competition	demonstrations.	Everyone	let	her go	 to	 bed	 with	 no	 idea	 that	 she	 was	 falling	 apart.	 But	 she	 knew	 she	 had	 to	 act now	before	she	lost	her	nerve.	The	curtain	of	night	would	aid	in	her	escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	pushed	open	her	bedroom	door	and	peeked	out.	Empty.	With	the	bulging</p>
<p class="calibre1">pillowcase	over	her	shoulder,	she	crept	into	the	hallway	as	silently	as	she	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	she	was	caught	off	academy	grounds	and	in	the	Crown	without	an	ID	card</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	pass	of	some	sort,	she	would	get	arrested.	Since	she	was	under	eighteen,	she didn’t	have	a	card	yet,	but	she	didn’t	have	a	pass	either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 only	 hope	 was	 to	 sneak	 off	 academy	 grounds,	 go	 through	 the	 palace graveyard	 to	 Ridgerock	 Lake,	 and	 then	 she’d	 swim	 through	 the	 river	 that	 ran through	the	Crown	to	the	Gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	she	made	it	to	the	Gate,	things	would	be	easier.	Security	was	more	lax, and	 she	 had	 a	 little	 money.	 Just	 enough	 to	 get	 her	 to	 the	 Storm.	 She	 didn’t remember	exactly	where	their	cottage	had	been	in	the	Storm,	but	it	would	easier to	find	than	Marmie’s	grave	after	she	was	buried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	had	been	tiptoeing	for	the	last	two	hallways.	Now,	she	held	her	breath as	 she	 pressed	 her	 back	 into	 the	 wall.	 Two	 guards	 whispered	 just	 around	 the corner	from	her	and	all	she	could	do	was	pray	they	weren’t	about	to	walk	right into	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	minute	passed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 muscles	 in	 her	 leg	 began	 to	 cramp.	 She	 adjusted	 her	 feet	 and	 tried	 to think	relaxing	thoughts.	Her	flesh	shivered	at	the	prompting	of	her	fever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	legs	started	cramping	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	when	she	was	ready	to	give	up,	the	guards	stopped	whispering	and	their footsteps	sounded	through	the	hall.	Were	they	coming	her	way? </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 let	 out	 a	 breath	 of	 relief	 when	 their	 footsteps	 got	 progressively	 quieter</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>with	 each	 step.	 The	 guard’s	 hallway	 was	 just	 around	 the	 next	 corner,	 and	 then she’d	be	off	toward	the	graveyard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	outside,	Talise	used	her	pillowcase	to	wipe	the	sweat	from	her	forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fevers	 had	 always	 been	 her	 least	 favorite	 way	 to	 be	 sick.	 Her	 body	 began pulsing	 with	 anticipation	 as	 she	 walked.	 The	 closer	 she	 came	 to	 the	 edge	 of academy	grounds,	the	more	her	stomach	roiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’d	 stopped	 looking	 over	 her	 shoulder	 now.	 This	 was	 happening	 whether her	brain	liked	it	or	not.	With	one	final	glance	back	at	the	grounds,	she	hoisted her	leg	up	on	the	gate	and	prepared	to	climb	over	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sound	of	crunching	gravel	made	her	heart	stop	in	her	chest.	Her	eyelids dropped	while	the	rest	of	her	body	froze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 only	 option	 now	 was	 to	 run.	 Whatever	 guard	 stood	 behind	 her	 would soon	sound	the	alarm.	Hopefully	she’d	have	at	least	a	few	seconds	to	get	to	the lake.	Maybe	she	could	shape	a	fire	onto	the	academy	grounds	to	keep	the	guards from	following	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	as	she	was	about	to	thrust	herself	over	the	gate,	a	small	voice	froze	her muscles	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait,”	the	voice	said.	“Just	wait,	please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy.	Not	a	guard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Relief	spread	through	Talise	almost	as	completely	as	her	fever.	But	no	matter how	 relieved	 she	 was,	 her	 determination	 hadn’t	 wavered.	 When	 she	 turned	 to face	her	friend,	she	didn’t	relax	her	grip	on	the	gate.	“You	can’t	stop	me,”	Talise said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	scrambled	toward	her,	clutching	her	side	and	panting.	“I’m	not	here	to stop	you.”	Wendy’s	voice	was	breathless	yet	resolute	all	the	same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 might	 have	 worried	 Talise	 if	 Wendy’s	 previous	 words	 weren’t	 busy needling	 through	 her	 mind.	 She	 tried	 to	 find	 sense	 in	 them,	 but	 none	 could	 be found.  <i class="calibre3">Not</i>	 there	 to	 stop	 her?	 Maybe	 it	 was	 a	 trap.	 It	 didn’t	 seem	 likely	 from someone	 like	 her	 gentle	 friend,	 but	 she	 didn’t	 have	 the	 luxury	 of	 taking	 any chances.	Clutching	the	gate	even	harder,	Talise	asked,	“Why	are	you	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	lugged	a	bag	off	her	shoulder	that	seemed	much	heavier	than	Talise’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tossing	the	bag	toward	her,	Wendy	said,	“Did	you	even	think	to	pack	food?	Isn’t food	scarce	in	the	Storm?	Like	dangerously	scarce?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	caught	the	bag	with	her	mouth	half	open.	After	fiddling	with	the	knot, she	peeked	inside	and	saw	her	favorite	fruits,	breads,	and	a	large	pouch	of	dried meat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	 shook	 her	 head	 and	 let	 out	 a	 sigh.	 “I	 would	 have	 packed	 some</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>pastries,	 but	 I	 ate	 the	 last	 of	 mine	 a	 few	 nights	 ago.	 I	 haven’t	 had	 time	 to	 get more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 was	 still	 gaping	 at	 the	 bag	 of	 food.	 It	 was	 heavy	 but	 invaluable.	 The bread	wouldn’t	survive	her	swim	in	the	river,	but	the	fruit	and	meat	would.	This supply	 could	 last	 her	 weeks.	 It	 could	 mean	 the	 difference	 between	 death	 and survival.	 She	 wanted	 to	 be	 grateful	 for	 Wendy’s	 generosity,	 but	 apparently,	 she was	still	too	stunned	to	speak.	At	last,	she	managed	a	quiet,	“You’re	not	going	to stop	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	 ignored	 the	 question	 while	 she	 dug	 through	 her	 pockets.	 When	 her eyes	 lit	 up,	 she	 pulled	 a	 few	 paper	 packets	 from	 them.	 Each	 was	 labeled	 with painted	 pictures	 of	 vegetables.	 Suddenly	 sheepish,	 Wendy	 bit	 her	 lip	 as	 she handed	 the	 packets	 to	 her	 friend.	 “I	 thought	 you	 might	 need	 some	 seeds	 too.	 I don’t	 know	 if	 the	 ground	 is	 rich	 enough	 in	 the	 Storm	 to	 grow	 vegetables,	 but some	 people	 live	 there,	 and	 they	 have	 to	 eat	 something,	 right?	 I	 figured	 it	 was worth	a	chance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	the	emotion	came.	Talise’s	throat	choked	up	as	her	eyes	stung	with	tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 opened	 her	 mouth	 to	 say	 thank	 you,	 but	 no	 words	 escaped.	 It	 took	 all	 her effort	just	to	take	the	packets	and	hold	them	close	to	her	heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 shared	 a	 glance,	 and	 it	 spoke	 more	 than	 all	 the	 words	 Talise	 had	 ever said	in	her	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy’s	 eyes	 filled	 with	 tears	 as	 she	 threw	 her	 arms	 around	 Talise.	 They didn’t	speak,	but	they	didn’t	have	to.	There	was	nothing	to	say	except	goodbye and	goodbye	was	a	horrible	thing	to	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Wendy	pulled	away,	the	finality	of	the	decision	started	catching	up	to Talise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	 grabbed	 a	 piece	 of	 her	 hair	 and	 twirled	 it	 around	 her	 finger.	 She always	 did	 that	 when	 she	 was	 nervous.	 Clearing	 her	 voice,	 Wendy	 said,	 “You know	you	can’t	come	back,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise’s	throat	swelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy’s	voice	rose	up	a	notch.	“The	competition	will	be	over	by	the	time	you get	to	the	Storm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 know,”	 Talise	 said,	 but	 the	 surety	 in	 her	 voice	 was	 as	 much	 for	 her	 own benefit	as	it	was	for	Wendy’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 <i class="calibre3">know</i>?	Are	you	sure	you	know?	Do	you	really	understand	what	you’re giving	up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 have	 to	 be	 there.”	 This	 time,	 Talise’s	 words	 weren’t	 for	 anyone	 in particular.	 They	 were	 simply	 the	 words	 from	 her	 heart.	 The	 things	 her	 soul</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>whispered	into	her	bones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	 her	 funeral?”	 Wendy	 asked.	 Her	 voice	 had	 risen	 again,	 and	 her	 lip trembled	 with	 each	 word.	 “You	 have	 to	 be	 at	 her	 funeral	 when	 she’s	 already dead?	You	have	to	trap	yourself	back	in	the	life	she	wanted	you	to	escape?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 gulped.	 Her	 soul	 had	 stopped	 whispering.	 Now	 it	 was	 listening	 to Wendy	and	Talise	didn’t	like	it	one	bit.	“What	about	her	grave?	She	won’t	have	a single	 mark	 without	 mine.	 They	 don’t	 keep	 grave	 records	 in	 the	 Storm.	 If	 I’m not	at	the	funeral,	I	might	never	find	her	grave,	and	it	will	be	bare	forever.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	go,”	Wendy	said.	“You’ll	give	up	everything	Marmie	wanted	for	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	 not	 what	 she	 would	 want.	 She	 wants	 you	 to	 have	 a	 life	 outside	 the Storm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 that’s	 impossible	 now.”	 Talise	 turned	 away	 as	 she	 said	 it,	 pulling	 her arms	 over	 her	 stomach.	 The	 frog	 in	 her	 throat	 made	 it	 difficult	 to	 speak,	 but somehow,	she	managed.	“Aaden	beat	me.	He’s	going	to	beat	me	again	in	front	of the	emperor.	Why	should	I	stay	when	I	don’t	even	have	a	chance?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	the	truth	came	out.	The	truth	she’d	been	hiding	even	from	herself.	She pulled	 her	 arms	 tighter	 over	 her	 stomach,	 wishing	 she	 could	 curl	 into	 them	 the way	 she	 used	 to	 curl	 into	 Marmie	 when	 she	 was	 scared.	 A	 single	 tear	 began trickling	down	her	cheek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	find	a	way	to	beat	Aaden.”	Wendy	didn’t	seem	to	have	any	sympathy	for Talise’s	tear.	“You	still	have	three	days.	Make	your	demonstration	more	detailed or	dangerous	or	something.	Beat	him	like	Marmie	knew	you	could.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	words	sounded	nice.	Inspiring	even.	But	they	weren’t	enough.	Talise	had made	her	decision.	“I’m	leaving,”	she	said	as	she	wiped	away	the	tear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	 tugged	 at	 Talise’s	 elbow	 until	 they	 were	 facing	 each	 other.	 Wendy wore	a	frown	as	she	stared	at	her	friend.	It	seemed	like	she	intended	to	change Talise’s	mind	with	her	look	alone.	It	wouldn’t	work.	After	a	few	seconds,	Wendy seemed	to	understand.	Her	face	slackened	as	a	tremble	shook	through	her	bottom lip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	 turned	 away	 and	 reached	 for	 another	 piece	 of	 her	 hair.	 In	 a	 whisper she	said,	“I	won’t	stop	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise’s	heart	seemed	to	freeze.	She	breathed	in	and	out	just	to	make	sure	she still	 could.	 It	 was	 so	 much	 easier	 being	 defiant.	 But	 now	 Wendy	 gave	 her	 the responsibility	of	the	decision.	It	was	a	heavy	weight	to	bear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	was	right.	Talise	knew	she	was	right.	A	mark	on	a	grave	wasn’t	worth what	she	would	have	to	give	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 how	 could	 she	 leave	 Marmie’s	 grave	 bare?	 Completely	 and	 utterly	 bare</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a>without	one	single	mark.	The	idea	slashed	through	her	like	a	sword	and	her	heart bled	through	her	bones.	It	didn’t	matter	what	Marmie	would	have	wanted.	Talise couldn’t	live	with	herself	if	she	knew	Marmie’s	grave	was	bare. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 hoisted	 her	 leg	 onto	 the	 gate	 and	 ignored	 how	 her	 stomach	 sank.	 She ignored	 how	 her	 body	 shivered	 from	 a	 fever.	 She	 had	 to	 ignore	 it	 because	 she knew	she	wouldn’t	last	long	in	the	Storm	with	a	fever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 that	 didn’t	 matter.	 Even	 if	 she	 only	 lived	 another	 week,	 it	 was	 worth	 it because	Marmie	would	have	a	mark	on	her	grave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	her	own	grave	would	be	bare.	Not	Marmie’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise’s	breath	hitched	as	the	thought	of	death	shook	through	her.	Fear,	cold and	tight	pressed	through	her	skin	and	gripped	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why	 couldn’t	 she	 give	 her	 life	 for	 a	 mark	 on	 Marmie’s	 grave?	 Marmie deserved	it.	Why	did	the	survival	instinct	have	to	be	so	strong?	Reality	laid	itself bare	in	front	of	Talise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	want	to	die.	Not	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	fell	from	the	gate	when	she	let	go.	Her	body	smarted	against	the	gravel, but	 she	 didn’t	 bother	 breaking	 her	 fall.	 She	 just	 fell	 into	 a	 heap	 and	 pulled	 her knees	up	to	her	chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 body	 shook	 and	 shivered	 with	 each	 sob.	 She	 didn’t	 know	 crying	 could hurt	so	much.	Her	muscles	jumbled	and	her	bones	shattered,	but	it	only	acted	as fuel	 for	 her	 tears.	 The	 arms	 in	 her	 muscles	 strained	 as	 she	 clutched	 her	 knees closer	to	her	chest.	They	couldn’t	come	any	closer,	but	that	didn’t	stop	her	from pulling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 clung	 to	 them	 like	 she	 clung	 to	 the	 past.	 To	 Marmie.	 But	 the	 past	 was gone,	and	she	had	to	accept	that.	She	had	to	let	go,	or	her	future	would	crumble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	the	truth,	no	matter	how	much	she	hated	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steeling	herself	against	the	storm	inside,	Talise	pulled	herself	off	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	brushed	away	the	gravel	that	had	stuck	to	her.	When	she	rolled	her	shoulders back,	Wendy	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	you	can	beat	him,”	Wendy	said	as	she	wiped	the	tears	off	her	cheeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t.”	Talise’s	voice	no	longer	shook	with	fear.	Indecision	had	plagued	her before,	 but	 now	 she	 was	 filled	 with	 certainty.	 “Not	 unless	 I	 change	 my demonstration.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Again?	 But	 the	 competition	 is	 in	 three	 days.	 Can’t	 you	 adjust	 your demonstration?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 threw	 the	 bags	 over	 her	 shoulder	 as	 she	 began	 walking	 toward	 the academy	 living	 quarters.	 “No.	 You	 were	 right.	 I	 need	 something	 dangerous	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>catch	 the	 emperor’s	 attention.	 But	 the	 fire	 ribbons	 aren’t	 dangerous	 enough.	 I have	 to	 do	 something	 no	 one	 has	 ever	 attempted.	 Something	 no	 one	 could forget.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">THIRTEEN</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">WHILE	 RECOVERING	 FROM	 HER	 FEVER,	 TALISE	 THREW	 herself	 into</p>
<p class="calibre1">research.	 After	 three	 days,	 her	 body	 had	 healed	 but	 she	 was	 getting	 nowhere with	her	demonstration.	The	stacks	of	books	surrounding	her	were	so	high,	she could	barely	see	past	the	library	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Flipping	 through	 the	 pages	 of	 her	 current	 book,	 she	 let	 out	 a	 groan.	 “There has	to	be	someone	who’s	shaped	ice	before.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy	 sat	 across	 the	 table,	 pursing	 her	 lips	 together.	 Talise	 didn’t	 have	 to guess	the	thoughts	running	through	her	friend’s	mind	since	she’d	already	spoken them	aloud	several	times.  <i class="calibre3">Ice	is	too	dangerous</i>,	Wendy	had	said.  <i class="calibre3">It’s	impossible. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">You’ll	regret	it</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	didn’t	matter	how	many	times	Wendy	protested,	Talise	knew	what	she	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	do.	She	slammed	the	book	shut	and	added	it	to	the	stack	on	her	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here’s	 something,”	 Wendy	 said,	 though	 she	 seemed	 to	 regret	 having	 to	 let those	 words	 out	 of	 her	 mouth.	 “It’s	 from	 Master	 Shaper	 Luca.	 The	 one	 who discovered	internal	shaping.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 passage	 was	 only	 a	 few	 paragraphs,	 but	 it	 gave	 Talise	 the	 courage	 to hope.	 It	 came	 from	 Master	 Shaper	 Luca’s	 personal	 journal.	 He	 had	 lived	 many years	ago	and	worked	for	Emperor	Flarius’s	grandfather. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Water	 shaping	 comes	 from	 the	 eyes.	 Everyone	 knows	 this	 as	 easily	 as	 they</i> <i class="calibre3">know	earth	shaping	comes	from	the	feet	and	fire	shaping	comes	from	the	heart. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Lately,	 I	 have	 experimented	 with	 shaping	 elements	 inside	 of	 the	 body.	 It	 seems</i> <i class="calibre3">they	all	appear	in	different	places	while	inside.	Air	travels	through	the	muscles</i> <i class="calibre3">and	 bones.	 Fire	 seems	 to	 travel	 through	 the	 veins.	 Water,	 which	 I	 had	 guessed</i> <i class="calibre3">would	travel	through	the	veins,	actually	seems	to	travel	just	under	the	surface	of</i> <i class="calibre3">the	skin. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I	 discovered	 something	 else	 that	 deserves	 to	 be	 taught	 to	 all	 shapers</i> <i class="calibre3">everywhere.	A	warning	no	one	should	forget.	After	a	fair	bit	of	fire	shaping,	my</i> <i class="calibre3">insides	were	too	hot	for	comfort.	I	thought	I	might	cool	myself	by	doing	internal</i> <i class="calibre3">water	shaping,	and	then	freezing	the	water.	I	gave	myself	frostbite,	and	one	of	my</i> <i class="calibre3">fingers	will	have	to	be	removed.	Luckily,	it’s	only	the	pinky. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I’d	heard	ice	shaping	was	dangerous,	but	I	thought	because	I	was	cooling	a</i> <i class="calibre3">part	 of	 my	 body	 that	 was	 already	 hot,	 it	 would	 be	 fine.	 I	 was	 wrong.	 I	 can</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a> <i class="calibre3">irrevocably	say,	only	a	fool	should	ever	attempt	ice	shaping. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	sure	you	can’t	adjust	your	fire	ribbon	demonstration?”	Wendy	asked while	twirling	her	typical	bit	of	hair.	Her	face	was	all	pinched	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">None	 of	 that	 mattered	 to	 Talise	 because	 she	 finally	 had	 an	 idea.	 Master Shaper	 Luca	 had	 attempted	 to	 cool	 the	 heat	 inside	 his	 body,	 and	 it	 still	 led	 to frostbite.	 She	 had	 the	 same	 thought	 when	 she	 practiced	 her	 fire	 ribbon demonstration.	What	if	she	used	ice	to	cool	the	heat? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sitting	here	now,	she	could	see	it	was	all	wrong.	It	would	never	work	because ice	 was	 so	 much	 colder	 than	 the	 normal	 body	 temperature	 of	 a	 human.	 No wonder	Master	Shaper	Luca	had	gotten	frostbite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	she	had	another	thought.	A	magical	thought.	What	if	she	tried	it	the	other way	around? </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	if	she	didn’t	use	ice	to	cool	the	heat	from	a	fire?	What	if	she	used	fire	to warm	her	body	while	she	shaped	ice? </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	the	trick.	She	would	have	to	use	them	both	at	the	same	time.	That was	the	skill	everyone	else	had	always	missed.	Both	she	and	Master	Shaper	Luca originally	 thought	 they	 could	 cool	 parts	 of	 the	 body	 that	 were	 only	 slightly higher	than	body	temperature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	what	if	she	froze	her	skin	and	shaped	a	fire	through	her	veins	at	the	exact same	time? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simultaneously	shaping	two	elements	was	difficult.	For	many	shapers,	it	was impossible.	 But	 she	 wasn’t	 just	 any	 shaper.	 Ten	 years	 ago,	 she	 had	 promised Marmie	 she	 would	 be	 the	 best	 shaper	 Kamdaria	 had	 ever	 known.	 Now	 it	 was time	to	make	good	on	that	promise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 need	 some	 water,”	 Talise	 said.	 She	 knocked	 a	 stack	 of	 books	 over	 as	 she jumped	 from	 her	 seat.	 Not	 bothering	 to	 right	 them,	 she	 scurried	 to	 the	 back	 of the	 library	 where	 the	 containers	 of	 elements	 were	 kept.	 Just	 past	 the	 nearest bookshelf,	she	nearly	toppled	over	Aaden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 eyes	 went	 wide	 as	 he	 scrambled	 to	 grab	 a	 book	 off	 the	 shelf.	 He	 was suddenly	pouring	over	the	book	with	a	little	too	much	enthusiasm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Spying	on	me?”	Talise	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	slapped	the	book	shut,	dropping	all	pretense	that	he	cared	about	the	words inside.	 “You’ll	 never	 be	 able	 to	 do	 it.	 No	 one	 has	 ever	 shaped	 ice	 without regretting	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	lifted	her	chin	and	stepped	past	him	coolly.	Of	course	it	had	never	been done,	 but	 that	 wasn’t	 going	 to	 stop	 her	 from	 trying.	 It	 was	 the	 only	 way	 she could	beat	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>When	she	got	to	the	back	of	the	library,	she	took	a	bowl	of	water	and	a	bowl of	dirt.	Before	she	attempted	ice	shaping,	she	needed	to	practice	simultaneously shaping	two	elements.	She’d	start	with	earth	and	air	since	they	were	easiest	for her.	Maybe	she’d	make	dirt	rings	and	blow	bursts	of	air	through	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aaden	was	gone	by	the	time	she	made	her	way	back	to	the	table.	Why	did	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">care	so	much	about	becoming	Master	Shaper	anyway?	He	didn’t	need	it	like	she did.	Then	again,	he	was	from	the	Crown.	This	was	probably	the	first	time	in	his life	he	didn’t	immediately	get	the	thing	he	wanted	on	a	silver	platter.	Whatever his	reason,	he’d	just	have	to	live	without	the	victory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	bowed	unconsciously	to	the	portrait	of	Emperor	Flarius	as	she	passed	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	rich	fire	orange	robes	were	made	of	silk,	but	he	also	wore	a	brown	cloak	of speckled	 fur.	 His	 clothes	 were	 different	 in	 some	 of	 his	 portraits,	 but	 the	 crown was	always	the	same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gold	with	rubies	embedded	around	the	middle.	Each	of	the	tines	grew	up	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">equal	 height	 so	 the	 crown	 looked	 the	 same	 from	 every	 angle.	 That	 crown	 was almost	as	old	as	Kamdaria	itself,	and	Emperor	Flarius	loved	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	only	a	portrait,	but	his	eyes	seemed	to	watch	her	as	she	walked	back	to the	 table.	 What	 would	 he	 think	 of	 her	 plan?	 If	 she	 succeeded,	 she’d	 easily become	Master	Shaper.	But	if	she	failed?	He’d	think	her	a	fool. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	heart	pattered	as	she	sat	at	the	table.	The	thought	of	seeing	the	emperor	in person	always	made	her	nervous.	All	she	could	do	now	was	practice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Claye	had	joined	Wendy	at	the	table.	They	both	stopped	talking	the	moment</p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 appeared,	 giving	 her	 the	 impression	 they	 had	 been	 talking	 about	 her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Claye	 raised	 an	 eyebrow	 when	 Talise	 began	 shaping	 dirt	 rings.	 Both	 he	 and Wendy	were	surprised	when	Talise	shaped	bursts	of	air	through	the	dirt.	Wendy let	out	a	breath	of	relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 sighed.	 “I’m	 just	 practicing	 simultaneous	 shaping	 so	 it	 will	 be	 easier when	I	start	shaping	ice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	still	going	to	do	it?”	Claye	asked.	He	and	Wendy	shared	a	look	that told	 her	 everything	 she	 needed	 to	 know	 about	 what	 they’d	 been	 saying	 behind her	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 ignored	 them	 and	 kept	 shaping.	 It	 didn’t	 take	 long	 to	 learn	 two	 things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One,	simultaneous	shaping	was	easier	when	she	could	focus	one	half	of	her	body on	 one	 element	 and	 the	 other	 half	 of	 her	 body	 on	 the	 other	 element.	 And	 two, that	method	wouldn’t	work	when	she	started	shaping	ice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hour	after	hour	she	practiced	in	the	library.	Wendy	and	Claye	had	long	since left.	Wendy	begged	her	to	take	a	break	so	she	could	come	to	dinner,	but	Talise</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>refused.	The	muscles	around	her	eyes	were	starting	to	tire	from	all	the	strain	she put	on	them	when	she	narrowed	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	more	she	practiced,	the	easier	simultaneous	shaping	got.	She	would	have liked	another	week	to	practice,	or	truthfully,	another	year,	but	two	days	was	all she	had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	day,	she	skipped	her	shaping	lessons	altogether	and	kept	practicing in	 the	 library.	 There	 weren’t	 any	 lessons	 left	 to	 learn	 anyway.	 At	 this	 point, everyone	was	just	preparing	for	the	competition.	It	was	much	easier	to	practice simultaneous	shaping	without	the	other	students	gaping	at	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aaden	 hadn’t	 returned	 to	 the	 library.	 Or	 maybe	 he	 had,	 but	 she’d	 been	 too busy	 to	 notice.	 She	 tried	 not	 to	 think	 of	 it	 too	 much	 because	 it	 made	 her	 as nervous	as	the	thought	of	seeing	Emperor	Flarius. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	end	of	that	day,	she	had	started	simultaneously	shaping	fire	and	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing	inside	her	body	yet.	Her	latest	exercise	involved	bouncing	balls	of	water through	 the	 air	 while	 fire	 arrows	 would	 shoot	 straight	 through	 them.	 It	 would have	 been	 enough	 to	 beat	 any	 other	 student	 besides	 Aaden.	 Against	 him,	 it would	still	be	a	tie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 the	 exercise	 became	 too	 easy,	 she	 shaped	 the	 water	 back	 into	 its container	and	let	the	fire	die	around	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	more	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 just	 had	 one	 more	 day	 to	 practice.	 The	 day	 after	 that	 would	 be	 the competition.	She	always	intended	to	rest	the	day	before	the	competition,	but	she knew	 now	 that	 wasn’t	 an	 option.	 She	 hadn’t	 even	 shaped	 ice	 yet,	 let	 alone decided	what	to	make	with	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	as	she	had	that	thought,	the	image	of	Emperor	Flarius’s	portrait	came	to her	 mind.	 Aaden’s	 idea	 to	 make	 fire	 sculptures	 of	 the	 cherry	 trees	 Emperor Flarius	loved	was	brilliant.	An	idea	like	that	might	be	worth	copying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 wouldn’t	 make	 trees.	 Her	 ice	 shaping	 would	 never	 be	 as	 detailed	 as Aaden’s,	 especially	 with	 only	 one	 day	 to	 practice.	 She	 needed	 to	 make something	the	emperor	would	recognize	and	love,	but	something	that	would	be easier.	Something	flashy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	crown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 crown	 would	 be	 easy	 enough	 to	 replicate,	 but	 it	 would	 still	 be recognizable.	It	wouldn’t	be	gold	or	have	red	rubies,	but	the	emperor	would	still understand	even	if	it	was	made	of	ice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sitting	the	library	chair,	Talise	closed	her	eyes	as	she	took	in	a	deep	breath.	It was	close	to	evening	now	and	the	other	students	were	all	busy	getting	ready	for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>bed.	 She	 had	 nothing	 left	 to	 distract	 her	 mind.	 The	 time	 had	 come	 for	 her	 to shape	ice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fear	roiled	through	her.	Her	brow	glistened	even	though	her	fever	had	healed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	took	in	another	deep	breath	and	sent	a	fire	burning	through	her	veins.	The heat	 felt	 nice	 at	 first,	 but	 it	 grew	 unpleasant	 after	 only	 a	 few	 minutes.	 During those	 minutes,	 she	 figured	 out	 how	 to	 localize	 the	 heat	 in	 specific	 parts	 of	 her body.	The	fire	always	began	in	her	heart,	but	once	it	was	started,	she	could	move it	to	only	burn	inside	the	veins	of	her	arms	and	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	the	true	test	came.	She	shaped	the	water	out	of	the	bowl,	so	it	levitated over	one	palm.	She	started	with	a	small	amount	of	water,	no	bigger	than	a	coin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fire	burned	harder	inside	her,	and	she	took	a	steadying	breath	to	calm	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Based	 on	 Master	 Shaper	 Luca’s	 journal,	 she	 knew	 to	 note	 her	 heartbeat,	 her internal	temperature,	and	her	breathing.	If	any	of	these	seemed	off,	she’d	have	to adjust	her	fire	shaping	to	compensate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 shaped	 the	 water	 into	 a	 square.	 Then	 she	 shaped	 it	 into	 a	 flower,	 and then	a	fish.	She	was	stalling,	but	the	shaping	helped	calm	her	nerves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 last,	 she	 shaped	 the	 water	 into	 a	 simple	 ball.	 With	 her	 eyes	 narrowed	 to tiny	 slits,	 she	 internally	 shaped	 water	 around	 her	 fingers.	 The	 urge	 to	 hold	 her breath	was	strong,	but	she	knew	it	would	be	best	to	keep	breathing	normally.	She had	to	regulate	her	breath	to	know	if	frostbite	or	hypothermia	were	imminent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	froze	the	water	in	her	fingers	and	let	the	cold	air	rise	so	it	could	freeze	the levitating	water	into	ice.	Again,	she	paid	special	attention	to	her	vital	life	signs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 heart	 kept	 beating	 at	 a	 steady	 tempo.	 Not	 too	 fast.	 Not	 too	 slow.	 Her breathing	remained	constant.	The	skin	temperature	in	her	hands	was	cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feeling	 the	 fire	 in	 her	 veins,	 she	 sent	 it	 just	 a	 little	 closer	 to	 her	 hands.	 Too close	and	it	would	melt	the	ice	in	her	fingers.	Too	far	and	she’d	have	frostbite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	spent	a	few	seconds	getting	it	just	right,	but	soon	the	truth	became	clear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	going	to	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 less	 fear,	 she	 sent	 another	 wave	 of	 cold	 through	 her	 fingers,	 and	 the levitating	ball	of	ice	began	to	freeze.	Ice	crystals	first	formed	at	the	bottom	of	the water	ball,	but	soon	they	crept	up	the	sides	until	the	entire	ball	had	frozen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	gasped	behind	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 lost	 control	 of	 the	 ice	 shaping	 immediately,	 and	 the	 ball	 turned	 back	 to water.	But	it	didn’t	matter	because	it	had	worked.	One	more	day	would	be	plenty of	time	to	learn	how	to	shape	an	ice	crown.	The	emperor	would	never	forget	her</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>demonstration,	and	neither	would	anyone	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	smiled	as	she	turned	around	to	face	the	person	who	had	gasped	behind her.	She	smiled	because	she	recognized	him	the	instant	she	heard	his	gasp.	It	was such	beautiful	symmetry	that	he	gasped,	just	like	she	had	when	she	snuck	in	to see	him	shape	fire	cherry	blossoms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	her	eyes	met	Aaden’s,	she	saw	true	fear	in	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	said	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	both	knew	what	that	ball	of	ice	meant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	going	to	win. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">FOURTEEN</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">ICE	THROUGH	THE	FINGERS,	FIRE	IN	THE	VEINS. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	closed	her	eyes	as	she	pushed	the	mantra	through	her	mind,	willing	it to	 become	 reality	 within	 her.	 Shaping	 the	 water	 was	 easy,	 but	 freezing	 it	 still came	with	the	threat	of	hypothermia.	With	only	the	previous	day	to	practice,	ice shaping	required	her	utmost	concentration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	stared	at	the	porcelain	bowl	of	water	sitting	on	the	desk	in	front	of	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	 Dew	 stood	 at	 the	 front	 of	 the	 classroom,	 fiddling	 with	 a	 stack	 of	 papers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	knew	she	was	watching	her	from	the	corner	of	her	eye.	Everyone	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	competition	was	an	hour	away,	which	meant	it	was	too	late	for	anyone	to change	 their	 demonstration.	 Now	 she	 could	 practice	 in	 front	 of	 them	 with	 no fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ice	and	Fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	could	do	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	a	sharp	intake	of	breath,	she	shaped	the	water	until	it	levitated	out	of	the bowl.	 Holding	 her	 palm	 upward,	 she	 moved	 her	 fingers	 through	 the	 air	 as	 if twisting	an	invisible	ball. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	puddle	of	floating	water	slowly	started	spinning.	Round	and	around	until air	appeared	in	the	center	and	it	resembled	a	spinning	donut.	Her	fingers	twisted faster	and	soon	the	water	shape	went	from	donut	to	a	thin	circle	of	water	just	big enough	to	fit	on	the	crown	of	a	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 continued	 spinning	 the	 water,	 taking	 several	 deep	 breaths	 to	 prepare herself	for	what	came	next.	Biting	her	lip,	she	let	her	fingers	freeze	both	literally and	 figuratively.	 As	 the	 water	 stopped	 spinning,	 tiny	 ice	 crystals	 appeared around	the	bottom	edge,	freezing	the	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	stood	her	fingers	straight	up,	willing	the	water	to	grow	tines	and	slowly froze	the	tines	as	they	grew.	As	the	ice	crown	took	shape,	her	heart	thumped	in her	chest,	reminding	her	of	the	cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Momentarily	ignoring	the	 crown,	she	breathed	 a	fire	through	 her	veins	until her	heart	stopped	its	complaining.	When	both	the	crown	and	the	heat	were	just right,	she	used	her	fingers	to	levitate	the	crown	through	the	air	until	it	landed	on her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	exactly	five	seconds,	she	levitated	the	crown	off	her	head	and	dropped	it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>back	 into	 the	 bowl.	 She	 melted	 the	 ice	 as	 it	 moved	 through	 the	 air,	 so	 it	 was nothing	more	than	a	puddle	of	water	by	the	time	it	hit	the	porcelain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	victorious	smile	spread	on	her	lips	as	she	stared	back	at	the	water.	She	had this	competition	in	the	bag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Elements	in	their	containers	please,”	Mrs.	Dew	said.	She	clapped	her	hands together,	 pressing	 her	 lips	 into	 a	 thin	 line.	 “We	 leave	 for	 the	 palace	 in	 a	 few minutes.	 Remember,	 Emperor	 Flarius	 will	 only	 choose	 one	 of	 you	 as	 Master Shaper.	Whoever	is	chosen	will	receive	a	permanent	place	at	the	palace	with	the other	Master	Shapers.	But	even	more	importantly,	that	person	will	receive	great honor.	 A	 silver	 crescent	 moon	 will	 be	 stamped	 on	 the	 ID	 cards	 of	 the	 Master Shaper’s	children,	grandchildren,	and	great-grandchildren.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	seat	to	her	left,	she	noticed	Aaden	mockingly	opening	and	closing	his hand	 while	 mouthing	  <i class="calibre3">blah	 blah	 blah</i>.	 He	 rolled	 his	 eyes	 and	 whispered	 to whoever	would	listen,	“She	says	this	like	it’s	the	first	time	we’ve	heard	it.	As	if this	wasn’t	what	we’ve	been	preparing	for	all	our	lives	at	the	academy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 pinned	 him	 with	 one	 of	 her	 most	 wicked	 glares,	 hoping	 he	 would squirm	 in	 his	 seat.	 The	 entire	 point	 of	 this	 competition	 was	 to	 win	 honor.	 If Aaden	mocked	his	elder	so	openly,	he	had	no	business	winning	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately,	her	glare	did	nothing	but	make	Aaden	chuckle,	and	run	a	hand through	 his	 hair	 coolly.	 Despite	 his	 bravado,	 she	 noticed	 his	 hands	 shaking	 the tiniest	bit.	It	made	the	corner	of	her	lip	cock	up	in	a	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing	 her	 confidence,	 Aaden	 scoffed.	 “You’re	 still	 afraid	 I’ll	 win.	 Maybe you	 can	 shape	 ice,	 but	 my	 fire	 sculptures	 are	 more	 detailed	 than	 anything	 the emperor	has	ever	seen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	developed	a	cocky	attitude	since	he	caught	her	ice	shaping	in	the	library. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 fire	 sculptures	 were	 exquisite.	 She’d	 never	 argue	 that,	 but	 she	 didn’t	 think he’d	win	now.	Not	even	Emperor	Flarius	Ruemon	himself	could	shape	ice,	and he	was	a	talented	shaper.	Her	ice	crown	would	win	everyone	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	 Dew	 announced	 the	 arrival	 of	 the	 boat	 that	 would	 take	 them	 across Ridgerock	 Lake	 right	 to	 the	 entrance	 of	 Ridgerock	 Palace.	 Talise	 hung	 back	 to take	 one	 last	 look	 at	 the	 classroom.	 She’d	 spent	 ten	 years	 on	 the	 academy grounds,	and	it	seemed	impossible	it	was	finally	time	to	say	goodbye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	thoughts	drifted	to	Marmie	so	suddenly,	she	almost	grabbed	the	desk	to steady	herself.	She	had	to	shove	away	the	thoughts	of	the	funeral	or	else	she’d turn	into	a	sobbing	mess.	But	she	didn’t	push	away	all	thoughts	of	Marmie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 she	 stood	 there	 looking	 at	 her	 empty	 classroom,	 Talise	 made	 a	 promise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ll	 find	 your	 grave	 someday,	 Talise	 thought.	 And	 I’ll	 leave	 the	 four	 most</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>intricate	marks	any	Master	Shaper	has	ever	left. </p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">A	STUFFY,	HUMID	HEAT	HUNG	IN	THE	air,	reminding	her	of	the	riverboat</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 had	 taken	 to	 get	 to	 academy	 testing.	 She	 had	 forgotten	 boats	 felt	 like	 that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Except	this	time,	there	were	wooden	chairs	nailed	to	the	deck,	so	she	wouldn’t have	to	stand	the	whole	time.	Wendy	waved	at	her	so	they	could	sit	together,	but Claye	took	the	seat	just	before	Talise	got	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendy’s	cheeks	turned	pink	as	she	bit	her	bottom	lip.	“I	forgot	I	told	Claye we	could	sit	together.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	 gave	 a	 simple	 smile	 and	 kept	 moving	 toward	 the	 back	 of	 the	 boat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing	could	sour	her	mood	now.	Her	nose	wrinkled	when	she	realized	every seat	on	the	boat	had	been	taken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	except	one	in	the	very	back,	right	next	to	her	least	favorite	person.	Aaden didn’t	bother	to	acknowledge	her	existence	as	the	boat	began	to	slip	away	from the	shore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 seems	 wasteful	 to	 take	 a	 boat	 when	 the	 palace	 is	 so	 close,	 don’t	 you think?”	Talise	asked.	Maybe	she	shouldn’t	dislike	him	so	much,	especially	now when	she	was	going	to	win. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 seemed	 to	 have	 the	 opposite	 thought.	 Deliberately	 ignoring	 her,	 he	 held his	palms	out	in	front	of	him	and	narrowed	his	eyes	until	flames	appeared	above his	 hands.	 The	 flames	 quickly	 formed	 into	 trees,	 and	 the	 branches	 grew	 out	 of the	burning	trunk	just	like	real	branches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	took	Talise	far	too	much	concentration	to	not	be	mesmerized	as	the	flame trees	 grew	 in	 Aaden’s	 palms.	 Soon,	 little	 blossoms	 popped	 out	 from	 the branches,	perfectly	mirroring	the	cherry	blossoms	that	covered	each	of	the	trees surrounding	the	palace.	They	looked	so	much	better	up	close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Forgetting	 her	 anger,	 Talise	 leaned	 forward	 to	 get	 a	 closer	 look.	 Exquisite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	surpassed	what	she	had	seen	before.	He	must	have	been	practicing	in	secret like	she	had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	 warning,	 a	 few	 branches	 grew	 out	 of	 control	 until	 one	 licked	 her face.	“Hey,”	she	said,	putting	a	hand	to	her	cheek.	“You	burned	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 flame	 trees	 vanished,	 and	 Aaden	 turned	 to	 her	 with	 a	 sneer.	 “Then	 use your	ice	shaping	to	cool	your	skin.”	He	turned	away	from	her	without	a	trace	of guilt. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>Her	jaw	flexed	as	she	clenched	her	teeth	together.	She	had	already	pushed	ice through	 her	 fingers	 and	 against	 her	 cheek,	 but	 what	 if	 he’d	 been	 sitting	 by anybody	 else?	 He	 should	 have	 been	 more	 careful.	 And	 besides,	 they	 weren’t supposed	 to	 practice	 on	 the	 boat	 anyway.	 Mrs.	 Dew	 had	 been	 telling	 them	 for weeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	as	Talise	prepared	to	give	him	the	lecture	of	the	century,	sharp	footsteps brought	her	gaze	to	the	aisle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aaden,”	 Mrs.	 Dew	 said	 with	 no	 small	 amount	 of	 contempt.	 “Were	 you shaping	on	the	boat?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	Aaden	said,	looking	straight	into	Mrs.	Dew’s	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise	let	out	a	huff.	“You	compete	for	honor,	yet	you	lie	to	your	elder	like	it’s nothing?	You	don’t	deserve	to	win,	no	matter	how	detailed	your	fire	sculptures are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aaden	held	his	chin	high	wearing	a	face	that	declared	 <i class="calibre3">she</i>	was	lying,	not	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was	he	shaping,	Talise?”	Mrs.	Dew	asked	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 a	 moment,	 her	 breath	 stilled.	 If	 he	 admitted	 to	 lying,	 he	 would	 be punished.	But	if	he	said	nothing	and	she	told	the	truth	for	him,	his	punishment would	be	much	more	severe.	She	stayed	silent	for	a	few	breaths,	giving	him	the chance	to	come	clean.	Still,	he	said	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clenching	her	jaw,	she	shot	him	with	another	glare.	Today	was	too	important to	protect	someone	like	Aaden.	She	needed	to	win	the	competition.	Years	spent living	in	the	Storm	had	taught	her	how	much	one	good	mark	could	change	a	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 <i class="calibre3">needed</i>	to	be	chosen	as	Master	Shaper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	was,”	Talise	said	with	her	eyes	to	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aaden,”	 Mrs.	 Dew	 said	 through	 an	 exasperated	 breath.	 “I	 told	 you	 no	 one was	allowed	to	practice	on	the	boat,	and	you	did	it	anyway?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	said	nothing	as	he	stared	back,	never	once	breaking	eye	contact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing?”	Mrs.	Dew	said.	“No	explanation?”	With	a	tiny	shake	of	her	head, she	turned	around.	Over	her	shoulder	she	said,	“Then,	you	are	disqualified	from the	competition	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	Aaden	said	in	a	whisper.	When	Mrs.	Dew	kept	walking,	he	stood	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	shouted	the	same	question.	“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	no	response	still,	Aaden	shouted,	“You	can’t	do	that!	I’ve	been	training all	my	life	for	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aaden	Sato,”	Mrs.	Dew	said.	“You	will	keep	your	thoughts	to	yourself	until I	decide	what	to	do	you	with	you.”	She	clapped	her	hands,	then	waved	toward the	boat	exit.	“Everyone	file	out	in	an	orderly	fashion.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a><img src="index-76_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Talise’s	 jaw	 had	 dropped,	 which	 she	 only	 noticed	 when	 she	 realized	 she’d been	holding	her	breath.	Aaden	Sato?  <i class="calibre3">Sato</i>?	The	name	distracted	her	more	than the	events	that	had	just	transpired.	Was	he	really	going	to	be	disqualified?	Aaden deserved	punishment,	but	this? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	ounce	of	sympathy	drained	out	of	her	when	Aaden	gripped	her	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulder.	 “You,”	 he	 said.	 He	 didn’t	 speak	 another	 word,	 but	 he	 didn’t	 have	 to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	 pair	 of	 flames	 burned	 out	 of	 him,	 this	 time	 not	 from	 his	 hands,	 but around	his	irises.	As	his	eyes	burned,	they	said	one	thing	as	they	glared	at	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Revenge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fire	in	his	eyes	was	meant	to	frighten	her,	but	nothing	terrified	her	more than	 his	 name.	 She	 gulped	 and	 jumped	 from	 her	 seat,	 eager	 to	 put	 as	 much distance	between	them	as	possible.	They	exited	the	boat,	but	not	even	the	sight of	Ridgerock	Palace	was	enough	to	distract	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	name	Sato	had	been	revered	in	the	Crown	for	years.	Aaden’s	family	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	 respected	 than	 almost	 anyone.	 Every	 member	 of	 his	 family	 had	 a	 silver crescent	moon	on	their	ID	cards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	except	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	Talise	could	only	wonder,	was	Aaden	honorable	like	his	grandfather?	A</p>
<p class="calibre1">shiver	crawled	up	her	spine.	Or	would	he	be	more	like	his	father? </p>
