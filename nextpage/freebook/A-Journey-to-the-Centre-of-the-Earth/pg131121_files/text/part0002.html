<p class="calibre8">"Hastigt, hastigt!" cried our guide.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Now I certainly knew nothing of Danish, but I thoroughly understood that his gestures were meant to quicken us.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The guide turned rapidly in a direction which would take us to the back of the crater, all the while ascending slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We followed rapidly, despite our excessive fatigue.</p>
<p class="calibre8">A quarter of an hour later Hans paused to enable us to look back. The mighty whirlwind of sand was spreading up the slope of the mountain to the very spot where we had proposed to halt. Huge stones were caught up, cast into the air, and thrown about as during an eruption. We were happily a little out of the direction of the wind, and therefore out of reach of danger. But for the precaution and knowledge of our guide, our dislocated bodies, our crushed and broken limbs, would have been cast to the wind, like dust from some unknown meteor.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Hans, however, did not think it prudent to pass the night on the bare side of the cone. We therefore continued our journey in a zigzag direction. The fifteen hundred feet which remained to be accomplished took us at least five hours. The turnings and windings, the no-thoroughfares, the marches and marches, turned that insignificant distance into at least three leagues. I never felt such misery, fatigue and exhaustion in my life. I was ready to faint from hunger and cold. The rarefied air at the same time painfully acted upon my lungs.</p>
<p class="calibre8">At last, when I thought myself at my last gasp, about eleven at night, it being in that region quite dark, we reached the summit of Mount Sneffels! It was in an awful mood of mind, that despite my fatigue, before I descended into the crater which was to shelter us for the night, I paused to behold the sun rise at midnight on the very day of its lowest declension, and enjoyed the spectacle of its ghastly pale rays cast upon the isle which lay sleeping at our feet!</p>
<p class="calibre8">I no longer wondered at people traveling all the way from England to Norway to behold this magical and wondrous spectacle.</p>

<h4 id="pgepubid00027" class="calibre7">THE SHADOW OF SCARTARIS</h4>
<p class="calibre8">Our supper was eaten with ease and rapidity, after which everybody did the best he could for himself within the hollow of the crater. The bed was hard, the shelter unsatisfactory, the situation painful—lying in the open air, five thousand feet above the level of the sea!</p>
<p class="calibre8">Nevertheless, it has seldom happened to me to sleep so well as I did on that particular night. I did not even dream. So much for the effects of what my uncle called "wholesome fatigue."</p>
<p class="calibre8">Next day, when we awoke under the rays of a bright and glorious sun, we were nearly frozen by the keen air. I left my granite couch and made one of the party to enjoy a view of the magnificent spectacle which developed itself, panorama-like, at our feet.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I stood upon the lofty summit of Mount Sneffels' southern peak. Thence I was able to obtain a view of the greater part of the island. The optical delusion, common to all lofty heights, raised the shores of the island, while the central portions appeared depressed. It was by no means too great a flight of fancy to believe that a giant picture was stretched out before me. I could see the deep valleys that crossed each other in every direction. I could see precipices looking like sides of wells, lakes that seemed to be changed into ponds, ponds that looked like puddles, and rivers that were transformed into petty brooks. To my right were glaciers upon glaciers, and multiplied peaks, topped with light clouds of smoke.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The undulation of these infinite numbers of mountains, whose snowy summits make them look as if covered by foam, recalled to my remembrance the surface of a storm-beaten ocean. If I looked towards the west, the ocean lay before me in all its majestic grandeur, a continuation as it were, of these fleecy hilltops.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Where the earth ended and the sea began it was impossible for the eye to distinguish.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I soon felt that strange and mysterious sensation which is awakened in the mind when looking down from lofty hilltops, and now I was able to do so without any feeling of nervousness, having fortunately hardened myself to that kind of sublime contemplation.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I wholly forgot who I was, and where I was. I became intoxicated with a sense of lofty sublimity, without thought of the abysses into which my daring was soon about to plunge me. I was presently, however, brought back to the realities of life by the arrival of the Professor and Hans, who joined me upon the lofty summit of the peak.</p>
<p class="calibre8">My uncle, turning in a westerly direction, pointed out to me a light cloud of vapor, a kind of haze, with a faint outline of land rising out of the waters.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Greenland!" said he.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Greenland?" cried I in reply.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes," continued my uncle, who always when explaining anything spoke as if he were in a professor's chair; "we are not more than thirty-five leagues distant from that wonderful land. When the great annual breakup of the ice takes place, white bears come over to Iceland, carried by the floating masses of ice from the north. This, however, is a matter of little consequence. We are now on the summit of the great, the transcendent Sneffels, and here are its two peaks, north and south. Hans will tell you the name by which the people of Iceland call that on which we stand."</p>
<p class="calibre8">My uncle turned to the imperturbable guide, who nodded, and spoke as usual—one word.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Scartaris."</p>
<p class="calibre8">My uncle looked at me with a proud and triumphant glance.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"A crater," he said, "you hear?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">I did hear, but I was totally unable to make reply.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The crater of Mount Sneffels represented an inverted cone, the gaping orifice apparently half a mile across; the depth indefinite feet. Conceive what this hole must have been like when full of flame and thunder and lightning. The bottom of the funnel-shaped hollow was about five hundred feet in circumference, by which it will be seen that the slope from the summit to the bottom was very gradual, and we were therefore clearly able to get there without much fatigue or difficulty. Involuntarily, I compared this crater to an enormous loaded cannon; and the comparison completely terrified me.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"To descend into the interior of a cannon," I thought to myself, "when perhaps it is loaded, and will go off at the least shock, is the act of a madman."</p>
<p class="calibre8">But there was no longer any opportunity for me to hesitate. Hans, with a perfectly calm and indifferent air, took his usual post at the head of the adventurous little band. I followed without uttering a syllable.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I felt like the lamb led to the slaughter.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In order to render the descent less difficult, Hans took his way down the interior of the cone in rather a zigzag fashion, making, as the sailors say, long tracks to the eastward, followed by equally long ones to the west. It was necessary to walk through the midst of eruptive rocks, some of which, shaken in their balance, went rolling down with thundering clamor to the bottom of the abyss. These continual falls awoke echoes of singular power and effect.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Many portions of the cone consisted of inferior glaciers. Hans, whenever he met with one of these obstacles, advanced with a great show of precaution, sounding the soil with his long iron pole in order to discover fissures and layers of deep soft snow. In many doubtful or dangerous places, it became necessary for us to be tied together by a long rope in order that should any one of us be unfortunate enough to slip, he would be supported by his companions. This connecting link was doubtless a prudent precaution, but not by any means unattended with danger.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Nevertheless, and despite all the manifold difficulties of the descent, along slopes with which our guide was wholly unacquainted, we made considerable progress without accident. One of our great parcels of rope slipped from one of the Iceland porters, and rushed by a short cut to the bottom of the abyss.</p>
<p class="calibre8">By midday we were at the end of our journey. I looked upwards, and saw only the upper orifice of the cone, which served as a circular frame to a very small portion of the sky—a portion which seemed to me singularly beautiful. Should I ever again gaze on that lovely sunlit sky!</p>
<p class="calibre8">The only exception to this extraordinary landscape, was the Peak of Scartaris, which seemed lost in the great void of the heavens.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The bottom of the crater was composed of three separate shafts, through which, during periods of eruption, when Sneffels was in action, the great central furnace sent forth its burning lava and poisonous vapors. Each of these chimneys or shafts gaped open-mouthed in our path. I kept as far away from them as possible, not even venturing to take the faintest peep downwards.</p>
<p class="calibre8">As for the Professor, after a rapid examination of their disposition and characteristics, he became breathless and panting. He ran from one to the other like a delighted schoolboy, gesticulating wildly, and uttering incomprehensible and disjointed phrases in all sorts of languages.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Hans, the guide, and his humbler companions seated themselves on some piles of lava and looked silently on. They clearly took my uncle for a lunatic; and—waited the result.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Suddenly the Professor uttered a wild, unearthly cry. At first I imagined he had lost his footing, and was falling headlong into one of the yawning gulfs. Nothing of the kind. I saw him, his arms spread out to their widest extent, his legs stretched apart, standing upright before an enormous pedestal, high enough and black enough to bear a gigantic statue of Pluto. His attitude and mien were that of a man utterly stupefied. But his stupefaction was speedily changed to the wildest joy.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Harry! Harry! come here!" he cried; "make haste—wonderful—wonderful!"</p>
<p class="calibre8">Unable to understand what he meant, I turned to obey his commands. Neither Hans nor the other Icelanders moved a step.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Look!" said the Professor, in something of the manner of the French general, pointing out the pyramids to his army.</p>
<p class="calibre8">And fully partaking his stupefaction, if not his joy, I read on the eastern side of the huge block of stone, the same characters, half eaten away by the corrosive action of time, the name, to me a thousand times accursed—</p>
<div class="figcenter"></div>
<p class="calibre8">"Arne Saknussemm!" cried my uncle, "now, unbeliever, do you begin to have faith?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">It was totally impossible for me to answer a single word. I went back to my pile of lava, in a state of silent awe. The evidence was unanswerable, overwhelming!</p>
<p class="calibre8">In a few moments, however, my thoughts were far away, back in my German home, with Gretchen and the old cook. What would I have given for one of my cousin's smiles, for one of the ancient domestic's omelettes, and for my own feather bed!</p>
<p class="calibre8">How long I remained in this state I know not. All I can say is, that when at last I raised my head from between my hands, there remained at the bottom of the crater only myself, my uncle and Hans. The Icelandic porters had been dismissed and were now descending the exterior slopes of Mount Sneffels, on their way to Stapi. How heartily did I wish myself with them!</p>
<p class="calibre8">Hans slept tranquilly at the foot of a rock in a kind of rill of lava, where he had made himself a rough and ready bed. MY uncle was walking about the bottom of the crater like a wild beast in a cage. I had no desire, neither had I the strength, to move from my recumbent position. Taking example by the guide, I gave way to a kind of painful somnolency, during which I seemed both to hear and feel continued heavings and shudderings in the mountain.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In this way we passed our first night in the interior of a crater.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Next morning, a grey, cloudy, heavy sky hung like a funereal pall over the summit of the volcanic cone. I did not notice it so much from the obscurity that reigned around us, as from the rage with which my uncle was devoured.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I fully understood the reason, and again a glimpse of hope made my heart leap with joy. I will briefly explain the cause.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Of the three openings which yawned beneath our steps, only one could have been followed by the adventurous Saknussemm. According to the words of the learned Icelander, it was only to be known by that one particular mentioned in the cryptograph, that the shadow of Scartaris fell upon it, just touching its mouth in the last days of the month of June.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We were, in fact, to consider the pointed peak as the stylus of an immense sun-dial, the shadow of which pointed on one given day, like the inexorable finger of fate, to the yawning chasm which led into the interior of the earth.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Now, as often happens in these regions, should the sun fail to burst through the clouds, no shadow. Consequently, no chance of discovering the right aperture. We had already reached the 25th June. If the kindly heavens would only remain densely clouded for six more days, we should have to put off our voyage of discovery for another year, when certainly there would be one person fewer in the party. I already had sufficient of the mad and monstrous enterprise.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It would be utterly impossible to depict the impotent rage of Professor Hardwigg. The day passed away, and not the faintest outline of a shadow could be seen at the bottom of the crater. Hans the guide never moved from his place. He must have been curious to know what we were about, if indeed he could believe we were about anything. As for my uncle, he never addressed a word to me. He was nursing his wrath to keep it warm! His eyes fixed on the black and foggy atmosphere, his complexion hideous with suppressed passion. Never had his eyes appeared so fierce, his nose so aquiline, his mouth so hard and firm.</p>
<p class="calibre8">On the 26th no change for the better. A mixture of rain and snow fell during the whole day. Hans very quietly built himself a hut of lava into which he retired like Diogenes into his tub. I took a malicious delight in watching the thousand little cascades that flowed down the side of the cone, carrying with them at times a stream of stones into the "vasty deep" below.</p>
<p class="calibre8">My uncle was almost frantic: to be sure, it was enough to make even a patient man angry. He had reached to a certain extent the goal of his desires, and yet he was likely to be wrecked in port.</p>
<p class="calibre8">But if the heavens and the elements are capable of causing us much pain and sorrow, there are two sides to a medal. And there was reserved for Professor Hardwigg a brilliant and sudden surprise which was to compensate him for all his sufferings.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Next day the sky was still overcast, but on Sunday, the 28th, the last day but two of the month, with a sudden change of wind and a new moon there came a change of weather. The sun poured its beaming rays to the very bottom of the crater.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Each hillock, every rock, every stone, every asperity of the soil had its share of the luminous effulgence, and its shadow fell heavily on the soil. Among others, to his insane delight, the shadow of Scartaris was marked and clear, and moved slowly with the radiant start of day.</p>
<p class="calibre8">My uncle moved with it in a state of mental ecstasy.</p>
<p class="calibre8">At twelve o'clock exactly, when the sun had attained its highest altitude for the day, the shadow fell upon the edge of the central pit!</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Here it is," gasped the Professor in an agony of joy, "here it is—we have found it. Forward, my friends, into the Interior of the Earth."</p>
<p class="calibre8">I looked curiously at Hans to see what reply he would make to this terrific announcement.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Forut," said the guide tranquilly.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Forward it is," answered my uncle, who was now in the seventh heaven of delight.</p>
<p class="calibre8">When we were quite ready, our watches indicated thirteen minutes past one!</p>

<div class="calibre2"></div><div class="calibre2"></div><h2 id="pgepubid00028" class="calibre3"><a id="CHAPTER_14" class="calibre6"></a>CHAPTER 14</h2>
<h4 id="pgepubid00029" class="calibre7">THE REAL JOURNEY COMMENCES</h4>
<p class="calibre8">Our real journey had now commenced. Hitherto our courage and determination had overcome all difficulties. We were fatigued at times; and that was all. Now we were about to encounter unknown and fearful dangers.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I had not as yet ventured to take a glimpse down the horrible abyss into which in a few minutes more I was about to plunge. The fatal moment had, however, at last arrived. I had still the option of refusing or accepting a share in this foolish and audacious enterprise. But I was ashamed to show more fear than the eider-duck hunter. Hans seemed to accept the difficulties of the journey so tranquilly, with such calm indifference, with such perfect recklessness of all danger, that I actually blushed to appear less of a man than he!</p>
<p class="calibre8">Had I been alone with my uncle, I should certainly have sat down and argued the point fully; but in the presence of the guide I held my tongue. I gave one moment to the thought of my charming cousin, and then I advanced to the mouth of the central shaft.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It measured about a hundred feet in diameter, which made about three hundred in circumference. I leaned over a rock which stood on its edge, and looked down. My hair stood on end, my teeth chattered, my limbs trembled. I seemed utterly to lose my centre of gravity, while my head was in a sort of whirl, like that of a drunken man. There is nothing more powerful than this attraction towards an abyss. I was about to fall headlong into the gaping well, when I was drawn back by a firm and powerful hand. It was that of Hans. I had not taken lessons enough at the Frelser's-Kirk of Copenhagen in the art of looking down from lofty eminences without blinking!</p>
<p class="calibre8">However, few as the minutes were during which I gazed down this tremendous and even wondrous shaft, I had a sufficient glimpse of it to give me some idea of its physical conformation. Its sides, which were almost as perpendicular as those of a well, presented numerous projections which doubtless would assist our descent.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It was a sort of wild and savage staircase, without bannister or fence. A rope fastened above, near the surface, would certainly support our weight and enable us to reach the bottom, but how, when we had arrived at its utmost depth, were we to loosen it above? This was, I thought, a question of some importance.</p>
<p class="calibre8">My uncle, however, was one of those men who are nearly always prepared with expedients. He hit upon a very simple method of obviating this difficulty. He unrolled a cord about as thick as my thumb, and at least four hundred feet in length. He allowed about half of it to go down the pit and catch in a hitch over a great block of lava which stood on the edge of the precipice. This done, he threw the second half after the first.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Each of us could now descend by catching the two cords in one hand. When about two hundred feet below, all the explorer had to do was to let go one end and pull away at the other, when the cord would come falling at his feet. In order to go down farther, all that was necessary was to continue the same operation.</p>
<p class="calibre8">This was a very excellent proposition, and no doubt, a correct one. Going down appeared to me easy enough; it was the coming up again that now occupied my thoughts.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Now," said my uncle, as soon as he had completed this important preparation, "let us see about the baggage. It must be divided into three separate parcels, and each of us must carry one on his back. I allude to the more important and fragile articles."</p>
<p class="calibre8">My worthy and ingenious uncle did not appear to consider that we came under the denomination.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Hans," he continued, "you will take charge of the tools and some of the provisions; you, Harry, must take possession of another third of the provisions and of the arms. I will load myself with the rest of the eatables, and with the more delicate instruments."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"But," I exclaimed, "our clothes, this mass of cord and ladders—who will undertake to carry them down?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"They will go down of themselves."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"And how so?" I asked.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"You shall see."</p>
<p class="calibre8">My uncle was not fond of half measures, nor did he like anything in the way of hesitation. Giving his orders to Hans he had the whole of the nonfragile articles made up into one bundle; and the packet, firmly and solidly fastened, was simply pitched over the edge of the gulf.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I heard the moaning of the suddenly displaced air, and the noise of falling stones. My uncle leaning over the abyss followed the descent of his luggage with a perfectly self-satisfied air, and did not rise until it had completely disappeared from sight.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Now then," he cried, "it is our turn."</p>
<p class="calibre8">I put it in good faith to any man of common sense—was it possible to hear this energetic cry without a shudder?</p>
<p class="calibre8">The Professor fastened his case of instruments on his back. Hans took charge of the tools, I of the arms. The descent then commenced in the following order: Hans went first, my uncle followed, and I went last. Our progress was made in profound silence—a silence only troubled by the fall of pieces of rock, which breaking from the jagged sides, fell with a roar into the depths below.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I allowed myself to slide, so to speak, holding frantically on the double cord with one hand and with the other keeping myself off the rocks by the assistance of my iron-shod pole. One idea was all the time impressed upon my brain. I feared that the upper support would fail me. The cord appeared to me far too fragile to bear the weight of three such persons as we were, with our luggage. I made as little use of it as possible, trusting to my own agility and doing miracles in the way of feats of dexterity and strength upon the projecting shelves and spurs of lava which my feet seemed to clutch as strongly as my hands.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The guide went first, I have said, and when one of the slippery and frail supports broke from under his feet he had recourse to his usual monosyllabic way of speaking.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Gif akt—"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Attention—look out," repeated my uncle.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In about half an hour we reached a kind of small terrace formed by a fragment of rock projecting some distance from the sides of the shaft.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Hans now began to haul upon the cord on one side only, the other going as quietly upward as the other came down. It fell at last, bringing with it a shower of small stones, lava and dust, a disagreeable kind of rain or hail.</p>
<p class="calibre8">While we were seated on this extraordinary bench I ventured once more to look downwards. With a sigh I discovered that the bottom was still wholly invisible. Were we, then, going direct to the interior of the earth?</p>
<p class="calibre8">The performance with the cord recommenced, and a quarter of an hour later we had reached to the depth of another two hundred feet.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I have very strong doubts if the most determined geologist would, during that descent, have studied the nature of the different layers of earth around him. I did not trouble my head much about the matter; whether we were among the combustible carbon, Silurians, or primitive soil, I neither knew nor cared to know.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Not so the inveterate Professor. He must have taken notes all the way down, for, at one of our halts, he began a brief lecture.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"The farther we advance," said he, "the greater is my confidence in the result. The disposition of these volcanic strata absolutely confirms the theories of Sir Humphry Davy. We are still within the region of the primordial soil, the soil in which took place the chemical operation of metals becoming inflamed by coming in contact with the air and water. I at once regret the old and now forever exploded theory of a central fire. At all events, we shall soon know the truth."</p>
<p class="calibre8">Such was the everlasting conclusion to which he came. I, however, was very far from being in humor to discuss the matter. I had something else to think of. My silence was taken for consent; and still we continued to go down.</p>
<p class="calibre8">At the expiration of three hours, we were, to all appearance, as far off as ever from the bottom of the well. When I looked upwards, however, I could see that the upper orifice was every minute decreasing in size. The sides of the shaft were getting closer and closer together, we were approaching the regions of eternal night!</p>
<p class="calibre8">And still we continued to descend!</p>
<p class="calibre8">At length, I noticed that when pieces of stone were detached from the sides of this stupendous precipice, they were swallowed up with less noise than before. The final sound was sooner heard. We were approaching the bottom of the abyss!</p>
<p class="calibre8">As I had been very careful to keep account of all the changes of cord which took place, I was able to tell exactly what was the depth we had reached, as well as the time it had taken.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We had shifted the rope twenty-eight times, each operation taking a quarter of an hour, which in all made seven hours. To this had to be added twenty-eight pauses; in all ten hours and a half. We started at one, it was now, therefore, about eleven o'clock at night.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It does not require great knowledge of arithmetic to know that twenty-eight times two hundred feet makes five thousand six hundred feet in all (more than an English mile).</p>
<p class="calibre8">While I was making this mental calculation a voice broke the silence. It was the voice of Hans.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Halt!" he cried.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I checked myself very suddenly, just at the moment when I was about to kick my uncle on the head.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"We have reached the end of our journey," said the worthy Professor in a satisfied tone.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"What, the interior of the earth?" said I, slipping down to his side.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"No, you stupid fellow! but we have reached the bottom of the well."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"And I suppose there is no farther progress to be made?" I hopefully exclaimed.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Oh, yes, I can dimly see a sort of tunnel, which turns off obliquely to the right. At all events, we must see about that tomorrow. Let us sup now, and seek slumber as best we may."</p>
<p class="calibre8">I thought it time, but made no observations on that point. I was fairly launched on a desperate course, and all I had to do was to go forward hopefully and trustingly.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It was not even now quite dark, the light filtering down in a most extraordinary manner.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We opened the provision bag, ate a frugal supper, and each did his best to find a bed amid the pile of stones, dirt, and lava which had accumulated for ages at the bottom of the shaft.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I happened to grope out the pile of ropes, ladders, and clothes which we had thrown down; and upon them I stretched myself. After such a day's labor, my rough bed seemed as soft as down!</p>
<p class="calibre8">For a while I lay in a sort of pleasant trance.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Presently, after lying quietly for some minutes, I opened my eyes and looked upwards. As I did so I made out a brilliant little dot, at the extremity of this long, gigantic telescope.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It was a star without scintillating rays. According to my calculation, it must be Beta in the constellation of the Little Bear.</p>
<p class="calibre8">After this little bit of astronomical recreation, I dropped into a sound sleep.</p>

<h4 id="pgepubid00031" class="calibre7">WE CONTINUE OUR DESCENT</h4>
<p class="calibre8">At eight o'clock the next morning, a faint kind of dawn of day awoke us. The thousand and one prisms of the lava collected the light as it passed and brought it to us like a shower of sparks.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We were able with ease to see objects around us.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, Harry, my boy," cried the delighted Professor, rubbing his hands together, "what say you now? Did you ever pass a more tranquil night in our house in the Konigstrasse? No deafening sounds of cart wheels, no cries of hawkers, no bad language from boatmen or watermen!"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, Uncle, we are quite at the bottom of this well—but to me there is something terrible in this calm."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Why," said the Professor hotly, "one would say you were already beginning to be afraid. How will you get on presently? Do you know, that as yet, we have not penetrated one inch into the bowels of the earth."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"What can you mean, sir?" was my bewildered and astonished reply.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"I mean to say that we have only just reached the soil of the island itself. This long vertical tube, which ends at the bottom of the crater of Sneffels, ceases here just about on a level with the sea."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Are you sure, sir?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Quite sure. Consult the barometer."</p>
<p class="calibre8">It was quite true that the mercury, after rising gradually in the instrument, as long as our descent was taking place, had stopped precisely at twenty-nine degrees.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"You perceive," said the Professor, "we have as yet only to endure the pressure of air. I am curious to replace the barometer by the manometer."</p>
<p class="calibre8">The barometer, in fact, was about to become useless—as soon as the weight of the air was greater than what was calculated as above the level of the ocean.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"But," said I, "is it not very much to be feared that this ever-increasing pressure may not in the end turn out very painful and inconvenient?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"No," said he. "We shall descend very slowly, and our lungs will be gradually accustomed to breathe compressed air. It is well known that aeronauts have gone so high as to be nearly without air at all—why, then, should we not accustom ourselves to breathe when we have, say, a little too much of it? For myself, I am certain I shall prefer it. Let us not lose a moment. Where is the packet which preceded us in our descent?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">I smilingly pointed it out to my uncle. Hans had not seen it, and believed it caught somewhere above us: "Huppe" as he phrased it.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Now," said my uncle, "let us breakfast, and break fast like people who have a long day's work before them."</p>
<p class="calibre8">Biscuit and dried meat, washed down by some mouthfuls of water flavored with Schiedam, was the material of our luxurious meal.</p>
<p class="calibre8">As soon as it was finished, my uncle took from his pocket a notebook destined to be filled by memoranda of our travels. He had already placed his instruments in order, and this is what he wrote:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p class="calibre8">Monday, June 29th</p>
<p class="calibre8">Chronometer, 8h. 17m. morning.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Barometer, 29.6 inches.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Thermometer, 6 degrees [43 degrees Fahr.]</p>
<p class="calibre8">Direction, E.S.E.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">This last observation referred to the obscure gallery, and was indicated to us by the compass.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Now, Harry," cried the Professor, in an enthusiastic tone of voice, "we are truly about to take our first step into the Interior of the Earth; never before visited by man since the first creation of the world. You may consider, therefore, that at this precise moment our travels really commence."</p>
<p class="calibre8">As my uncle made this remark, he took in one hand the Ruhmkorff coil apparatus, which hung round his neck, and with the other he put the electric current into communication with the worm of the lantern. And a bright light at once illumined that dark and gloomy tunnel!</p>
<p class="calibre8">The effect was magical!</p>
<p class="calibre8">Hans, who carried the second apparatus, had it also put into operation. This ingenious application of electricity to practical purposes enabled us to move along by the light of an artificial day, amid even the flow of the most inflammable and combustible gases.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Forward!" cried my uncle. Each took up his burden. Hans went first, my uncle followed, and I going third, we entered the somber gallery!</p>
<p class="calibre8">Just as we were about to engulf ourselves in this dismal passage, I lifted up my head, and through the tubelike shaft saw that Iceland sky I was never to see again!</p>
<p class="calibre8">Was it the last I should ever see of any sky?</p>
<p class="calibre8">The stream of lava flowing from the bowels of the earth in 1219 had forced itself a passage through the tunnel. It lined the whole of the inside with its thick and brilliant coating. The electric light added very greatly to the brilliancy of the effect.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The great difficulty of our journey now began. How were we to prevent ourselves from slipping down the steeply inclined plane? Happily some cracks, abrasures of the soil, and other irregularities, served the place of steps; and we descended slowly; allowing our heavy luggage to slip on before, at the end of a long cord.</p>
<p class="calibre8">But that which served as steps under our feet became in other places stalactites. The lava, very porous in certain places, took the form of little round blisters. Crystals of opaque quartz, adorned with limpid drops of natural glass suspended to the roof like lusters, seemed to take fire as we passed beneath them. One would have fancied that the genii of romance were illuminating their underground palaces to receive the sons of men.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Magnificent, glorious!" I cried in a moment of involuntary enthusiasm, "What a spectacle, Uncle! Do you not admire these variegated shades of lava, which run through a whole series of colors, from reddish brown to pale yellow—by the most insensible degrees? And these crystals, they appear like luminous globes."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"You are beginning to see the charms of travel, Master Harry," cried my uncle. "Wait a bit, until we advance farther. What we have as yet discovered is nothing—onwards, my boy, onwards!"</p>
<p class="calibre8">It would have been a far more correct and appropriate expression, had he said, "let us slide," for we were going down an inclined plane with perfect ease. The compass indicated that we were moving in a southeasterly direction. The flow of lava had never turned to the right or the left. It had the inflexibility of a straight line.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Nevertheless, to my surprise, we found no perceptible increase in heat. This proved the theories of Humphry Davy to be founded on truth, and more than once I found myself examining the thermometer in silent astonishment.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Two hours after our departure it only marked fifty-four degrees Fahrenheit. I had every reason to believe from this that our descent was far more horizontal than vertical. As for discovering the exact depth to which we had attained, nothing could be easier. The Professor as he advanced measured the angles of deviation and inclination; but he kept the result of his observations to himself.</p>
<p class="calibre8">About eight o'clock in the evening, my uncle gave the signal for halting. Hans seated himself on the ground. The lamps were hung to fissures in the lava rock. We were now in a large cavern where air was not wanting. On the contrary, it abounded. What could be the cause of this—to what atmospheric agitation could be ascribed this draught? But this was a question which I did not care to discuss just then. Fatigue and hunger made me incapable of reasoning. An unceasing march of seven hours had not been kept up without great exhaustion. I was really and truly worn out; and delighted enough I was to hear the word Halt.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Hans laid out some provisions on a lump of lava, and we each supped with keen relish. One thing, however, caused us great uneasiness—our water reserve was already half exhausted. My uncle had full confidence in finding subterranean resources, but hitherto we had completely failed in so doing. I could not help calling my uncle's attention to the circumstance.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"And you are surprised at this total absence of springs?" he said.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Doubtless—I am very uneasy on the point. We have certainly not enough water to last us five days."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Be quite easy on that matter," continued my uncle. "I answer for it we shall find plenty of water—in fact, far more than we shall want."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"But when?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"When we once get through this crust of lava. How can you expect springs to force their way through these solid stone walls?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"But what is there to prove that this concrete mass of lava does not extend to the centre of the earth? I don't think we have as yet done much in a vertical way."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"What puts that into your head, my boy?" asked my uncle mildly.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, it appears to me that if we had descended very far below the level of the sea—we should find it rather hotter than we have."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"According to your system," said my uncle; "but what does the thermometer say?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Scarcely fifteen degrees by Reaumur, which is only an increase of nine since our departure."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, and what conclusion does that bring you to?" inquired the Professor.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"The deduction I draw from this is very simple. According to the most exact observations, the augmentation of the temperature of the interior of the earth is one degree for every hundred feet. But certain local causes may considerably modify this figure. Thus at Yakoust in Siberia, it has been remarked that the heat increases a degree every thirty-six feet. The difference evidently depends on the conductibility of certain rocks. In the neighborhood of an extinct volcano, it has been remarked that the elevation of temperature was only one degree in every five-and-twenty feet. Let us, then, go upon this calculation—which is the most favorable—and calculate."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Calculate away, my boy."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Nothing easier," said I, pulling out my notebook and pencil. "Nine times one hundred and twenty-five feet make a depth of eleven hundred and twenty-five feet."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Archimedes could not have spoken more geometrically."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, according to my observations, we are at least ten thousand feet below the level of the sea."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Can it be possible?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Either my calculation is correct, or there is no truth in figures."</p>
<p class="calibre8">The calculations of the Professor were perfectly correct. We were already six thousand feet deeper down in the bowels of the earth than anyone had ever been before. The lowest known depth to which man had hitherto penetrated was in the mines of Kitzbuhel, in the Tirol, and those of Wurttemberg.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The temperature, which should have been eighty-one, was in this place only fifteen. This was a matter for serious consideration.</p>

<h4 id="pgepubid00033" class="calibre7">THE EASTERN TUNNEL</h4>
<p class="calibre8">The next day was Tuesday, the 30th of June—and at six o'clock in the morning we resumed our journey.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We still continued to follow the gallery of lava, a perfect natural pathway, as easy of descent as some of those inclined planes which, in very old German houses, serve the purpose of staircases. This went on until seventeen minutes past twelve, the precise instant at which we rejoined Hans, who, having been somewhat in advance, had suddenly stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"At last," cried my uncle, "we have reached the end of the shaft."</p>
<p class="calibre8">I looked wonderingly about me. We were in the centre of four cross paths—somber and narrow tunnels. The question now arose as to which it was wise to take; and this of itself was no small difficulty.</p>
<p class="calibre8">My uncle, who did not wish to appear to have any hesitation about the matter before myself or the guide, at once made up his mind. He pointed quietly to the eastern tunnel; and, without delay, we entered within its gloomy recesses.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Besides, had he entertained any feeling of hesitation it might have been prolonged indefinitely, for there was no indication by which to determine on a choice. It was absolutely necessary to trust to chance and good fortune!</p>
<p class="calibre8">The descent of this obscure and narrow gallery was very gradual and winding. Sometimes we gazed through a succession of arches, its course very like the aisles of a Gothic cathedral. The great artistic sculptors and builders of the Middle Ages might have here completed their studies with advantage. Many most beautiful and suggestive ideas of architectural beauty would have been discovered by them. After passing through this phase of the cavernous way, we suddenly came, about a mile farther on, upon a square system of arch, adopted by the early Romans, projecting from the solid rock, and keeping up the weight of the roof.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Suddenly we would come upon a series of low subterranean tunnels which looked like beaver holes, or the work of foxes—through whose narrow and winding ways we had literally to crawl!</p>
<p class="calibre8">The heat still remained at quite a supportable degree. With an involuntary shudder, I reflected on what the heat must have been when the volcano of Sneffels was pouring its smoke, flames, and streams of boiling lava—all of which must have come up by the road we were now following. I could imagine the torrents of hot seething stone darting on, bubbling up with accompaniments of smoke, steam, and sulphurous stench!</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Only to think of the consequences," I mused, "if the old volcano were once more to set to work."</p>
<p class="calibre8">I did not communicate these rather unpleasant reflections to my uncle. He not only would not have understood them, but would have been intensely disgusted. His only idea was to go ahead. He walked, he slid, he clambered over piles of fragments, he rolled down heaps of broken lava, with an earnestness and conviction it was impossible not to admire.</p>
<p class="calibre8">At six o'clock in the evening, after a very wearisome journey, but one not so fatiguing as before, we had made six miles towards the southward, but had not gone more than a mile downwards.</p>
<p class="calibre8">My uncle, as usual, gave the signal to halt. We ate our meal in thoughtful silence, and then retired to sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Our arrangements for the night were very primitive and simple. A traveling rug, in which each rolled himself, was all our bedding. We had no necessity to fear cold or any unpleasant visit. Travelers who bury themselves in the wilds and depths of the African desert, who seek profit and pleasure in the forests of the New World, are compelled to take it in turn to watch during the hours of sleep; but in this region of the earth absolute solitude and complete security reigned supreme.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We had nothing to fear either from savages or from wild beasts.</p>
<p class="calibre8">After a night's sweet repose, we awoke fresh and ready for action. There being nothing to detain us, we started on our journey. We continued to burrow through the lava tunnel as before. It was impossible to make out through what soil we were making way. The tunnel, moreover, instead of going down into the bowels of the earth, became absolutely horizontal.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I even thought, after some examination, that we were actually tending upwards. About ten o'clock in the day this state of things became so clear that, finding the change very fatiguing, I was obliged to slacken my pace and finally come to a halt.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well," said the Professor quickly, "what is the matter?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"The fact is, I am dreadfully tired," was my earnest reply.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"What," cried my uncle, "tired after a three hours' walk, and by so easy a road?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Easy enough, I dare say, but very fatiguing."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"But how can that be, when all we have to do is to go downwards."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"I beg your pardon, sir. For some time I have noticed that we are going upwards."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Upwards," cried my uncle, shrugging his shoulders, "how can that be?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"There can be no doubt about it. For the last half hour the slopes have been upward—and if we go on in this way much longer we shall find ourselves back in Iceland."</p>
<p class="calibre8">My uncle shook his head with the air of a man who does not want to be convinced. I tried to continue the conversation. He would not answer me, but once more gave the signal for departure. His silence I thought was only caused by concentrated ill-temper.</p>
<p class="calibre8">However this might be, I once more took up my load, and boldly and resolutely followed Hans, who was now in advance of my uncle. I did not like to be beaten or even distanced. I was naturally anxious not to lose sight of my companions. The very idea of being left behind, lost in that terrible labyrinth, made me shiver as with the ague.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Besides, if the ascending path was more arduous and painful to clamber, I had one source of secret consolation and delight. It was to all appearance taking us back to the surface of the earth. That of itself was hopeful. Every step I took confirmed me in my belief, and I began already to build castles in the air in relation to my marriage with my pretty little cousin.</p>
<p class="calibre8">About twelve o'clock there was a great and sudden change in the aspect of the rocky sides of the gallery. I first noticed it from the diminution of the rays of light which cast back the reflection of the lamp. From being coated with shining and resplendent lava, it became living rock. The sides were sloping walls, which sometimes became quite vertical.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We were now in what the geological professors call a state of transition, in the period of Silurian stones, so called because this specimen of early formation is very common in England in the counties formerly inhabited by the Celtic nation known as Silures.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"I can see clearly now," I cried; "the sediment from the waters which once covered the whole earth formed during the second period of its existence these schists and these calcareous rocks. We are turning our backs on the granite rocks, and are like people from Hamburg who would go to Lubeck by way of Hanover."</p>
<p class="calibre8">I might just as well have kept my observations to myself. My geological enthusiasm got the better, however, of my cooler judgment, and Professor Hardwigg heard my observations.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"What is the matter now?" he said, in a tone of great gravity.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well," cried I, "do you not see these different layers of calcareous rocks and the first indication of slate strata?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well; what then?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"We have arrived at that period of the world's existence when the first plants and the first animals made their appearance."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"You think so?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes, look; examine and judge for yourself."</p>
<p class="calibre8">I induced the Professor with some difficulty to cast the light of his lamp on the sides of the long winding gallery. I expected some exclamation to burst from his lips. I was very much mistaken. The worthy Professor never spoke a word.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It was impossible to say whether he understood me or not. Perhaps it was possible that in his pride—my uncle and a learned professor—he did not like to own that he was wrong in having chosen the eastern tunnel, or was he determined at any price to go to the end of it? It was quite evident we had left the region of lava, and that the road by which we were going could not take us back to the great crater of Mount Sneffels.</p>
<p class="calibre8">As we went along I could not help ruminating on the whole question, and asked myself if I did not lay too great a stress on these sudden and peculiar modifications of the earth's crust.</p>
<p class="calibre8">After all, I was very likely to be mistaken—and it was within the range of probability and possibility that we were not making our way through the strata of rocks which I believed I recognized piled on the lower layer of granitic formation.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"At all events, if I am right," I thought to myself, "I must certainly find some remains of primitive plants, and it will be absolutely necessary to give way to such indubitable evidence. Let us have a good search."</p>
<p class="calibre8">I accordingly lost no opportunity of searching, and had not gone more than about a hundred yards, when the evidence I sought for cropped up in the most incontestable manner before my eyes. It was quite natural that I should expect to find these signs, for during the Silurian period the seas contained no fewer than fifteen hundred different animal and vegetable species. My feet, so long accustomed to the hard and arid lava soil, suddenly found themselves treading on a kind of soft dust, the remains of plants and shells.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Upon the walls themselves I could clearly make out the outline, as plain as a sun picture, of the fucus and the lycopods. The worthy and excellent Professor Hardwigg could not of course make any mistake about the matter; but I believe he deliberately closed his eyes, and continued on his way with a firm and unalterable step.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I began to think that he was carrying his obstinacy a great deal too far. I could no longer act with prudence or composure. I stooped on a sudden and picked up an almost perfect shell, which had undoubtedly belonged to some animal very much resembling some of the present day. Having secured the prize, I followed in the wake of my uncle.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Do you see this?" I said.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, said the Professor, with the most imperturbable tranquillity, "it is the shell of a crustaceous animal of the extinct order of the trilobites; nothing more, I assure you."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"But," cried I, much troubled at his coolness, "do you draw no conclusion from it?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, if I may ask, what conclusion do you draw from it yourself?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, I thought—"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"I know, my boy, what you would say, and you are right, perfectly and incontestably right. We have finally abandoned the crust of lava and the road by which the lava ascended. It is quite possible that I may have been mistaken, but I shall be unable to discover my error until I get to the end of this gallery."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"You are quite right as far as that is concerned," I replied, "and I should highly approve of your decision, if we had not to fear the greatest of all dangers."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"And what is that?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Want of water."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, my dear Henry, it can't be helped. We must put ourselves on rations."</p>
<p class="calibre8">And on he went.</p>
<hr class="c"/>
<div class="calibre2"></div><div class="calibre2"></div><h2 id="pgepubid00034" class="calibre3"><a id="CHAPTER_17" class="calibre6"></a>CHAPTER 17</h2>
<h4 id="pgepubid00035" class="calibre7">DEEPER AND DEEPER—THE COAL MINE</h4>
<p class="calibre8">In truth, we were compelled to put ourselves upon rations. Our supply would certainly last not more than three days. I found this out about supper time. The worst part of the matter was that, in what is called the transition rocks, it was hardly to be expected we should meet with water!</p>
<p class="calibre8">I had read of the horrors of thirst, and I knew that where we were, a brief trial of its sufferings would put an end to our adventures—and our lives! But it was utterly useless to discuss the matter with my uncle. He would have answered by some axiom from Plato.</p>
<p class="calibre8">During the whole of next day we proceeded on our journey through this interminable gallery, arch after arch, tunnel after tunnel. We journeyed without exchanging a word. We had become as mute and reticent as Hans, our guide.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The road had no longer an upward tendency; at all events, if it had, it was not to be made out very clearly. Sometimes there could be no doubt that we were going downwards. But this inclination was scarcely to be distinguished, and was by no means reassuring to the Professor, because the character of the strata was in no wise modified, and the transition character of the rocks became more and more marked.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It was a glorious sight to see how the electric light brought out the sparkles in the walls of the calcareous rocks, and the old red sandstone. One might have fancied oneself in one of those deep cuttings in Devonshire, which have given their name to this kind of soil. Some magnificent specimens of marble projected from the sides of the gallery: some of an agate grey with white veins of variegated character, others of a yellow spotted color, with red veins; farther off might be seen samples of color in which cherry-tinted seams were to be found in all their brightest shades.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The greater number of these marbles were stamped with the marks of primitive animals. Since the previous evening, nature and creation had made considerable progress. Instead of the rudimentary trilobites, I perceived the remains of a more perfect order. Among others, the fish in which the eye of a geologist has been able to discover the first form of the reptile.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The Devonian seas were inhabited by a vast number of animals of this species, which were deposited in tens of thousands in the rocks of new formation.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It was quite evident to me that we were ascending the scale of animal life of which man forms the summit. My excellent uncle, the Professor, appeared not to take notice of these warnings. He was determined at any risk to proceed.</p>
<p class="calibre8">He must have been in expectation of one of two things; either that a vertical well was about to open under his feet, and thus allow him to continue his descent, or that some insurmountable obstacle would compel us to stop and go back by the road we had so long traveled. But evening came again, and, to my horror, neither hope was doomed to be realized!</p>
<p class="calibre8">On Friday, after a night when I began to feel the gnawing agony of thirst, and when in consequence appetite decreased, our little band rose and once more followed the turnings and windings, the ascents and descents, of this interminable gallery. All were silent and gloomy. I could see that even my uncle had ventured too far.</p>
<p class="calibre8">After about ten hours of further progress—a progress dull and monotonous to the last degree—I remarked that the reverberation, and reflection of our lamps upon the sides of the tunnel, had singularly diminished. The marble, the schist, the calcareous rocks, the red sandstone, had disappeared, leaving in their places a dark and gloomy wall, somber and without brightness. When we reached a remarkably narrow part of the tunnel, I leaned my left hand against the rock.</p>
<p class="calibre8">When I took my hand away, and happened to glance at it, it was quite black. We had reached the coal strata of the Central Earth.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"A coal mine!" I cried.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"A coal mine without miners," responded my uncle, a little severely.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"How can we tell?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"I can tell," replied my uncle, in a sharp and doctorial tone. "I am perfectly certain that this gallery through successive layers of coal was not cut by the hand of man. But whether it is the work of nature or not is of little concern to us. The hour for our evening meal has come—let us sup."</p>
<p class="calibre8">Hans, the guide, occupied himself in preparing food. I had come to that point when I could no longer eat. All I cared about were the few drops of water which fell to my share. What I suffered it is useless to record. The guide's gourd, not quite half full, was all that was left for us three!</p>
<p class="calibre8">Having finished their repast, my two companions laid themselves down upon their rugs, and found in sleep a remedy for their fatigue and sufferings. As for me, I could not sleep, I lay counting the hours until morning.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The next morning, Saturday, at six o'clock, we started again. Twenty minutes later we suddenly came upon a vast excavation. From its mighty extent I saw at once that the hand of man could have had nothing to do with this coal mine; the vault above would have fallen in; as it was, it was only held together by some miracle of nature.</p>
<p class="calibre8">This mighty natural cavern was about a hundred feet wide, by about a hundred and fifty high. The earth had evidently been cast apart by some violent subterranean commotion. The mass, giving way to some prodigious upheaving of nature, had split in two, leaving the vast gap into which we inhabitants of the earth had penetrated for the first time.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The whole singular history of the coal period was written on those dark and gloomy walls. A geologist would have been able easily to follow the different phases of its formation. The seams of coal were separated by strata of sandstone, a compact clay, which appeared to be crushed down by the weight from above.</p>
<p class="calibre8">At that period of the world which preceded the secondary epoch, the earth was covered by a coating of enormous and rich vegetation, due to the double action of tropical heat and perpetual humidity. A vast atmospheric cloud of vapor surrounded the earth on all sides, preventing the rays of the sun from ever reaching it.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Hence the conclusion that these intense heats did not arise from this new source of caloric.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Perhaps even the star of day was not quite ready for its brilliant work—to illumine a universe. Climates did not as yet exist, and a level heat pervaded the whole surface of the globe—the same heat existing at the North Pole as at the equator.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Whence did it come? From the interior of the earth?</p>
<p class="calibre8">In spite of all the learned theories of Professor Hardwigg, a fierce and vehement fire certainly burned within the entrails of the great spheroid. Its action was felt even to the very topmost crust of the earth; the plants then in existence, being deprived of the vivifying rays of the sun, had neither buds, nor flowers, nor odor, but their roots drew a strong and vigorous life from the burning earth of early days.</p>
<p class="calibre8">There were but few of what may be called trees—only herbaceous plants, immense turfs, briers, mosses, rare families, which, however, in those days were counted by tens and tens of thousands.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It is entirely to this exuberant vegetation that coal owes its origin. The crust of the vast globe still yielded under the influence of the seething, boiling mass, which was forever at work beneath. Hence arose numerous fissures, and continual falling in of the upper earth. The dense mass of plants being beneath the waters, soon formed themselves into vast agglomerations.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Then came about the action of natural chemistry; in the depths of the ocean the vegetable mass at first became turf, then, thanks to the influence of gases and subterranean fermentation, they underwent the complete process of mineralization.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In this manner, in early days, were formed those vast and prodigious layers of coal, which an ever—increasing consumption must utterly use up in about three centuries more, if people do not find some more economic light than gas, and some cheaper motive power than steam.</p>
<p class="calibre8">All these reflections, the memories of my school studies, came to my mind while I gazed upon these mighty accumulations of coal, whose riches, however, are scarcely likely to be ever utilized. The working of these mines could only be carried out at an expense that would never yield a profit.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The matter, however, is scarcely worthy consideration, when coal is scattered over the whole surface of the globe, within a few yards of the upper crust. As I looked at these untouched strata, therefore, I knew they would remain as long as the world lasts.</p>
<p class="calibre8">While we still continued our journey, I alone forgot the length of the road, by giving myself up wholly to these geological considerations. The temperature continued to be very much the same as while we were traveling amid the lava and the schists. On the other hand my sense of smell was much affected by a very powerful odor. I immediately knew that the gallery was filled to overflowing with that dangerous gas the miners call fire damp, the explosion of which has caused such fearful and terrible accidents, making a hundred widows and hundreds of orphans in a single hour.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Happily, we were able to illumine our progress by means of the Ruhmkorff apparatus. If we had been so rash and imprudent as to explore this gallery, torch in hand, a terrible explosion would have put an end to our travels, simply because no travelers would be left.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Our excursion through this wondrous coal mine in the very bowels of the earth lasted until evening. My uncle was scarcely able to conceal his impatience and dissatisfaction at the road continuing still to advance in a horizontal direction.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The darkness, dense and opaque a few yards in advance and in the rear, rendered it impossible to make out what was the length of the gallery. For myself, I began to believe that it was simply interminable, and would go on in the same manner for months.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Suddenly, at six o'clock, we stood in front of a wall. To the right, to the left above, below, nowhere was there any passage. We had reached a spot where the rocks said in unmistakable accents—No Thoroughfare.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I stood stupefied. The guide simply folded his arms. My uncle was silent.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, well, so much the better," cried my uncle, at last, "I now know what we are about. We are decidedly not upon the road followed by Saknussemm. All we have to do is to go back. Let us take one night's good rest, and before three days are over, I promise you we shall have regained the point where the galleries divided."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes, we may, if our strength lasts as long," I cried, in a lamentable voice.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"And why not?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Tomorrow, among us three, there will not be a drop of water. It is just gone."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"And your courage with it," said my uncle, speaking in a severe tone.</p>
<p class="calibre8">What could I say? I turned round on my side, and from sheer exhaustion fell into a heavy sleep disturbed by dreams of water! And I awoke unrefreshed.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I would have bartered a diamond mine for a glass of pure spring water!</p>
