<p class="calibre8"><a id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="part0007.html#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The keeper of gigantic cattle, himself still more gigantic!</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">Yes—it was no longer a fossil whose corpse we had raised from the ground in the great cemetery, but a giant capable of guiding and driving these prodigious monsters. His height was above twelve feet. His head, as big as the head of a buffalo, was lost in a mane of matted hair. It was indeed a huge mane, like those which belonged to the elephants of the earlier ages of the world.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In his hand was a branch of a tree, which served as a crook for this antediluvian shepherd.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We remained profoundly still, speechless with surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre8">But we might at any moment be seen by him. Nothing remained for us but instant flight.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Come, come!" I cried, dragging my uncle along; and, for the first time, he made no resistance to my wishes.</p>
<p class="calibre8">A quarter of an hour later we were far away from that terrible monster!</p>
<p class="calibre8">Now that I think of the matter calmly, and that I reflect upon it dispassionately; now that months, years, have passed since this strange and unnatural adventure befell us—what am I to think, what am I to believe?</p>
<p class="calibre8">No, it is utterly impossible! Our ears must have deceived us, and our eyes have cheated us! we have not seen what we believed we had seen. No human being could by any possibility have existed in that subterranean world! No generation of men could inhabit the lower caverns of the globe without taking note of those who peopled the surface, without communication with them. It was folly, folly, folly! nothing else!</p>
<p class="calibre8">I am rather inclined to admit the existence of some animal resembling in structure the human race—of some monkey of the first geological epochs, like that discovered by M. Lartet in the ossiferous deposit of Sansan.</p>
<p class="calibre8">But this animal, or being, whichsoever it was, surpassed in height all things known to modern science. Never mind. However unlikely it may be, it might have been a monkey—but a man, a living man, and with him a whole generation of gigantic animals, buried in the entrails of the earth—it was too monstrous to be believed!</p>

<h4 id="pgepubid00075" class="calibre7">THE MYSTERIOUS DAGGER</h4>
<p class="calibre8">During this time, we had left the bright and transparent forest far behind us. We were mute with astonishment, overcome by a kind of feeling which was next door to apathy. We kept running in spite of ourselves. It was a perfect Right, which resembled one of those horrible sensations we sometimes meet with in our dreams.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Instinctively we made our way towards the Central Sea, and I cannot now tell what wild thoughts passed through my mind, nor of what follies I might have been guilty, but for a very serious preoccupation which brought me back to practical life.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Though I was aware that we were treading on a soil quite new to us, I, however, every now and then noticed certain aggregations of rock, the shape of which forcibly reminded me of those near Port Gretchen.</p>
<p class="calibre8">This confirmed, moreover, the indications of the compass and our extraordinary and unlooked-for, as well as involuntary, return to the north of this great Central Sea. It was so like our starting point, that I could scarcely doubt the reality of our position. Streams and cascades fell in hundreds over the numerous projections of the rocks.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I actually thought I could see our faithful and monotonous Hans and the wonderful grotto in which I had come back to life after my tremendous fall.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Then, as we advanced still farther, the position of the cliffs, the appearance of a stream, the unexpected profile of a rock, threw me again into a state of bewildering doubt.</p>
<p class="calibre8">After some time, I explained my state of mental indecision to my uncle. He confessed to a similar feeling of hesitation. He was totally unable to make up his mind in the midst of this extraordinary but uniform panorama.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"There can be no doubt," I insisted, "that we have not landed exactly at the place whence we first took our departure; but the tempest has brought us above our starting point. I think, therefore, that if we follow the coast we shall once more find Port Gretchen."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"In that case," cried my uncle, "it is useless to continue our exploration. The very best thing we can do is to make our way back to the raft. Are you quite sure, Harry, that you are not mistaken?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"It is difficult," was my reply, "to come to any decision, for all these rocks are exactly alike. There is no marked difference between them. At the same time, the impression on my mind is that I recognize the promontory at the foot of which our worthy Hans constructed the raft. We are, I am nearly convinced, near the little port: if this be not it," I added, carefully examining a creek which appeared singularly familiar to my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"My dear Harry—if this were the case, we should find traces of our own footsteps, some signs of our passage; and I can really see nothing to indicate our having passed this way."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"But I see something," I cried, in an impetuous tone of voice, as I rushed forward and eagerly picked up something which shone in the sand under my feet.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"What is it?" cried the astonished and bewildered Professor.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"This," was my reply.</p>
<p class="calibre8">And I handed to my startled relative a rusty dagger, of singular shape.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"What made you bring with you so useless a weapon?" he exclaimed. "It was needlessly hampering yourself."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"I bring it? It is quite new to me. I never saw it before—are you sure it is not out of your collection?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Not that I know of," said the Professor, puzzled. "I have no recollection of the circumstance. It was never my property."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"This is very extraordinary," I said, musing over the novel and singular incident.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Not at all. There is a very simple explanation, Harry. The Icelanders are known to keep up the use of these antiquated weapons, and this must have belonged to Hans, who has let it fall without knowing it."</p>
<p class="calibre8">I shook my head. That dagger had never been in the possession of the pacific and taciturn Hans. I knew him and his habits too well.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Then what can it be—unless it be the weapon of some antediluvian warrior," I continued, "of some living man, a contemporary of that mighty shepherd from whom we have just escaped? But no—mystery upon mystery—this is no weapon of the stony epoch, nor even of the bronze period. It is made of excellent steel—"</p>
<p class="calibre8">Ere I could finish my sentence, my uncle stopped me short from entering upon a whole train of theories, and spoke in his most cold and decided tone of voice.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Calm yourself, my dear boy, and endeavor to use your reason. This weapon, upon which we have fallen so unexpectedly, is a true <i class="calibre5">dague</i>, one of those worn by gentlemen in their belts during the sixteenth century. Its use was to give the <i class="calibre5">coup de grace</i>, the final blow, to the foe who would not surrender. It is clearly of Spanish workmanship. It belongs neither to you, nor to me, nor the eider-down hunter, nor to any of the living beings who may still exist so marvelously in the interior of the earth."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"What can you mean, Uncle?" I said, now lost in a host of surmises.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Look closely at it," he continued; "these jagged edges were never made by the resistance of human blood and bone. The blade is covered with a regular coating of iron mold and rust, which is not a day old, not a year old, not a century old, but much more—"</p>
<p class="calibre8">The Professor began to get quite excited, according to custom, and was allowing himself to be carried away by his fertile imagination. I could have said something. He stopped me.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Harry," he cried, "we are now on the verge of a great discovery. This blade of a dagger you have so marvelously discovered, after being abandoned upon the sand for more than a hundred, two hundred, even three hundred years, has been indented by someone endeavoring to carve an inscription on these rocks."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"But this poniard never got here of itself," I exclaimed, "it could not have twisted itself. Someone, therefore, must have preceded us upon the shores of this extraordinary sea."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes, a man."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"But what man has been sufficiently desperate to do such a thing?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"A man who has somewhere written his name with this very dagger—a man who has endeavored once more to indicate the right road to the interior of the earth. Let us look around, my boy. You know not the importance of your singular and happy discovery."</p>
<p class="calibre8">Prodigiously interested, we walked along the wall of rock, examining the smallest fissures, which might finally expand into the much wished—for gully or shaft.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We at last reached a spot where the shore became extremely narrow. The sea almost bathed the foot of the rocks, which were here very lofty and steep. There was scarcely a path wider than two yards at any point. At last, under a huge over-hanging rock, we discovered the entrance of a dark and gloomy tunnel.</p>
<p class="calibre8">There, on a square tablet of granite, which had been smoothed by rubbing it with another stone, we could see two mysterious, and much worn letters, the two initials of the bold and extraordinary traveler who had preceded us on our adventurous journey.</p>
<div class="figcenter"></div>
<p class="calibre8">"A. S.!" cried my uncle. "You see, I was right. Arne Saknussemm, always Arne Saknussemm!"</p>

<div class="calibre2"></div><div class="calibre2"></div><h2 id="pgepubid00076" class="calibre3"><a id="CHAPTER_38" class="calibre6"></a>CHAPTER 38</h2>
<h4 id="pgepubid00077" class="calibre7">NO OUTLET—BLASTING THE ROCK</h4>
<p class="calibre8">Ever since the commencement of our marvelous journey, I had experienced many surprises, had suffered from many illusions. I thought that I was case-hardened against all surprises and could neither see nor hear anything to amaze me again.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I was like a many who, having been round the world, finds himself wholly blase and proof against the marvelous.</p>
<p class="calibre8">When, however, I saw these two letters, which had been engraven three hundred years before, I stood fixed in an attitude of mute surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Not only was there the signature of the learned and enterprising alchemist written in the rock, but I held in my hand the very identical instrument with which he had laboriously engraved it.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It was impossible, without showing an amount of incredulity scarcely becoming a sane man, to deny the existence of the traveler, and the reality of that voyage which I believed all along to have been a myth—the mystification of some fertile brain.</p>
<p class="calibre8">While these reflections were passing through my mind, my uncle, the Professor, gave way to an access of feverish and poetical excitement.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Wonderful and glorious genius, great Saknussemm," he cried, "you have left no stone unturned, no resource omitted, to show to other mortals the way into the interior of our mighty globe, and your fellow creatures can find the trail left by your illustrious footsteps, three hundred years ago, at the bottom of these obscure subterranean abodes. You have been careful to secure for others the contemplation of these wonders and marvels of creation. Your name engraved at every important stage of your glorious journey leads the hopeful traveler direct to the great and mighty discovery to which you devoted such energy and courage. The audacious traveler, who shall follow your footsteps to the last, will doubtless find your initials engraved with your own hand upon the centre of the earth. I will be that audacious traveler—I, too, will sign my name upon the very same spot, upon the central granite stone of this wondrous work of the Creator. But in justice to your devotion, to your courage, and to your being the first to indicate the road, let this cape, seen by you upon the shores of this sea discovered by you, be called, of all time, Cape Saknussemm."</p>
<p class="calibre8">This is what I heard, and I began to be roused to the pitch of enthusiasm indicated by those words. A fierce excitement roused me. I forgot everything. The dangers of the voyage and the perils of the return journey were now as nothing!</p>
<p class="calibre8">What another man had done in ages past could, I felt, be done again; I was determined to do it myself, and now nothing that man had accomplished appeared to me impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Forward—forward," I cried in a burst of genuine and hearty enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I had already started in the direction of the somber and gloomy gallery when the Professor stopped me; he, the man so rash and hasty, he, the man so easily roused to the highest pitch of enthusiasm, checked me, and asked me to be patient and show more calm.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Let us return to our good friend, Hans," he said; "we will then bring the raft down to this place."</p>
<p class="calibre8">I must say that though I at once yielded to my uncle's request, it was not without dissatisfaction, and I hastened along the rocks of that wonderful coast.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Do you know, my dear uncle," I said, as we walked along, "that we have been singularly helped by a concurrence of circumstances, right up to this very moment."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"So you begin to see it, do you, Harry?" said the Professor with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Doubtless," I responded, "and strangely enough, even the tempest has been the means of putting us on the right road. Blessings on the tempest! It brought us safely back to the very spot from which fine weather would have driven us forever. Supposing we had succeeded in reaching the southern and distant shores of this extraordinary sea, what would have become of us? The name of Saknussemm would never have appeared to us, and at this moment we should have been cast away upon an inhospitable coast, probably without an outlet."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes, Harry, my boy, there is certainly something providential in that wandering at the mercy of wind and waves towards the south: we have come back exactly north; and what is better still, we fall upon this great discovery of Cape Saknussemm. I mean to say, that it is more than surprising; there is something in it which is far beyond my comprehension. The coincidence is unheard of, marvelous!"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"What matter! It is not our duty to explain facts, but to make the best possible use of them."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Doubtless, my boy; but if you will allow me—" said the really delighted Professor.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Excuse me, sir, but I see exactly how it will be; we shall take the northern route; we shall pass under the northern regions of Europe, under Sweden, under Russia, under Siberia, and who knows where—instead of burying ourselves under the burning plains and deserts of Africa, or beneath the mighty waves of the ocean; and that is all, at this stage of our journey, that I care to know. Let us advance, and Heaven will be our guide!"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes, Harry, you are right, quite right; all is for the best. Let us abandon this horizontal sea, which could never have led to anything satisfactory. We shall descend, descend, and everlastingly descend. Do you know, my dear boy, that to reach the interior of the earth we have only five thousand miles to travel!"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Bah!" I cried, carried away by a burst of enthusiasm, "the distance is scarcely worth speaking about. The thing is to make a start."</p>
<p class="calibre8">My wild, mad, and incoherent speeches continued until we rejoined our patient and phlegmatic guide. All was, we found, prepared for an immediate departure. There was not a single parcel but what was in its proper place. We all took up our posts on the raft, and the sail being hoisted, Hans received his directions, and guided the frail bark towards Cape Saknussemm, as we had definitely named it.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The wind was very unfavorable to a craft that was unable to sail close to the wind. It was constructed to go before the blast. We were continually reduced to pushing ourselves forward by means of poles. On several occasions the rocks ran far out into deep water and we were compelled to make a long round. At last, after three long and weary hours of navigation, that is to say, about six o'clock in the evening, we found a place at which we could land.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I jumped on shore first. In my present state of excitement and enthusiasm, I was always first. My uncle and the Icelander followed. The voyage from the port to this point of the sea had by no means calmed me. It had rather produced the opposite effect. I even proposed to burn our vessel, that is, to destroy our raft, in order to completely cut off our retreat. But my uncle sternly opposed this wild project. I began to think him particularly lukewarm and unenthusiastic.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"At any rate, my dear uncle," I said, "let us start without delay."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes, my boy, I am quite as eager to do so as you can be. But, in the first place, let us examine this mysterious gallery, in order to find if we shall need to prepare and mend our ladders."</p>
<p class="calibre8">My uncle now began to see to the efficiency of our Ruhmkorff coil, which would doubtless soon be needed; the raft, securely fastened to a rock, was left alone. Moreover, the opening into the new gallery was not twenty paces distant from the spot. Our little troop, with myself at the head, advanced.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The orifice, which was almost circular, presented a diameter of about five feet; the somber tunnel was cut in the living rock, and coated on the inside by the different material which had once passed through it in a state of fusion. The lower part was about level with the water, so that we were able to penetrate to the interior without difficulty.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We followed an almost horizontal direction; when, at the end of about a dozen paces, our further advance was checked by the interposition of an enormous block of granite rock.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Accursed stone!" I cried furiously, on perceiving that we were stopped by what seemed an insurmountable obstacle.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In vain we looked to the right, in vain we looked to the left; in vain examined it above and below. There existed no passage, no sign of any other tunnel. I experienced the most bitter and painful disappointment. So enraged was I that I would not admit the reality of any obstacle. I stooped to my knees; I looked under the mass of stone. No hole, no interstice. I then looked above. The same barrier of granite! Hans, with the lamp, examined the sides of the tunnel in every direction.</p>
<p class="calibre8">But all in vain! It was necessary to renounce all hope of passing through.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I had seated myself upon the ground. My uncle walked angrily and hopelessly up and down. He was evidently desperate.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"But," I cried, after some moments' thought, "what about Arne Saknussemm?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"You are right," replied my uncle, "he can never have been checked by a lump of rock."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"No—ten thousand times no," I cried, with extreme vivacity. "This huge lump of rock, in consequence of some singular concussion, or process, one of those magnetic phenomena which have so often shaken the terrestrial crust, has in some unexpected way closed up the passage. Many and many years have passed away since the return of Saknussemm, and the fall of this huge block of granite. Is it not quite evident that this gallery was formerly the outlet for the pent-up lava in the interior of the earth, and that these eruptive matters then circulated freely? Look at these recent fissures in the granite roof; it is evidently formed of pieces of enormous stone, placed here as if by the hand of a giant, who had worked to make a strong and substantial arch. One day, after an unusually strong shock, the vast rock which stands in our way, and which was doubtless the key of a kind of arch, fell through to a level with the soil and has barred our further progress. We are right, then, in thinking that this is an unexpected obstacle, with which Saknussemm did not meet; and if we do not upset it in some way, we are unworthy of following in the footsteps of the great discoverer; and incapable of finding our way to the centre of the earth!"</p>
<p class="calibre8">In this wild way I addressed my uncle. The zeal of the Professor, his earnest longing for success, had become part and parcel of my being. I wholly forgot the past; I utterly despised the future. Nothing existed for me upon the surface of this spheroid in the bosom of which I was engulfed, no towns, no country, no Hamburg, no Koenigstrasse, not even my poor Gretchen, who by this time would believe me utterly lost in the interior of the earth!</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well," cried my uncle, roused to enthusiasm by my words, "Let us go to work with pickaxes, with crowbars, with anything that comes to hand—but down with these terrible walls."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"It is far too tough and too big to be destroyed by a pickax or crowbar," I replied.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"What then?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"As I said, it is useless to think of overcoming such a difficulty by means of ordinary tools."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"What then?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"What else but gunpowder, a subterranean mine? Let us blow up the obstacle that stands in our way."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Gunpowder!"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes; all we have to do is to get rid of this paltry obstacle."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"To work, Hans, to work!" cried the Professor.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The Icelander went back to the raft, and soon returned with a huge crowbar, with which he began to dig a hole in the rock, which was to serve as a mine. It was by no means a slight task. It was necessary for our purpose to make a cavity large enough to hold fifty pounds of fulminating gun cotton, the expansive power of which is four times as great as that of ordinary gunpowder.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I had now roused myself to an almost miraculous state of excitement. While Hans was at work, I actively assisted my uncle to prepare a long wick, made from damp gunpowder, the mass of which we finally enclosed in a bag of linen.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"We are bound to go through," I cried, enthusiastically.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"We are bound to go through," responded the Professor, tapping me on the back.</p>
<p class="calibre8">At midnight, our work as miners was completely finished; the charge of fulminating cotton was thrust into the hollow, and the match, which we had made of considerable length, was ready.</p>
<p class="calibre8">A spark was now sufficient to ignite this formidable engine, and to blow the rock to atoms!</p>
<p class="calibre8">"We will now rest until tomorrow."</p>
<p class="calibre8">It was absolutely necessary to resign myself to my fate, and to consent to wait for the explosion for six weary hours!</p>

<h4 id="pgepubid00079" class="calibre7">THE EXPLOSION AND ITS RESULTS</h4>
<p class="calibre8">The next day, which was the twenty-seventh of August, was a date celebrated in our wondrous subterranean journey. I never think of it even now, but I shudder with horror. My heart beats wildly at the very memory of that awful day.</p>
<p class="calibre8">From this time forward, our reason, our judgment, our human ingenuity, have nothing to do with the course of events. We are about to become the plaything of the great phenomena of the earth!</p>
<p class="calibre8">At six o'clock we were all up and ready. The dreaded moment was arriving when we were about to seek an opening into the interior of the earth by means of gunpowder. What would be the consequences of breaking through the crust of the earth?</p>
<p class="calibre8">I begged that it might be my duty to set fire to the mine. I looked upon it as an honor. This task once performed, I could rejoin my friends upon the raft, which had not been unloaded. As soon as we were all ready, we were to sail away to some distance to avoid the consequences of the explosion, the effects of which would certainly not be concentrated in the interior of the earth.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The slow match we calculated to burn for about ten minutes, more or less, before it reached the chamber in which the great body of powder was confined. I should therefore have plenty of time to reach the raft and put off to a safe distance.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I prepared to execute my self-allotted task—not, it must be confessed, without considerable emotion.</p>
<p class="calibre8">After a hearty repast, my uncle and the hunter-guide embarked on board the raft, while I remained alone upon the desolate shore.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I was provided with a lantern which was to enable me to set fire to the wick of the infernal machine.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Go, my boy," said my uncle, "and Heaven be with you. But come back as soon as you can. I shall be all impatience."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Be easy on that matter," I replied, "there is no fear of my delaying on the road."</p>
<p class="calibre8">Having said this, I advanced toward the opening of the somber gallery. My heart beat wildly. I opened my lantern and seized the extremity of the wick.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The Professor, who was looking on, held his chronometer in his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Are you ready?" cried he.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Quite ready."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, then, fire away!"</p>
<p class="calibre8">I hastened to put the light to the wick, which crackled and sparkled, hissing and spitting like a serpent; then, running as fast as I could, I returned to the shore.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Get on board, my lad, and you, Hans, shove off," cried my uncle.</p>
<p class="calibre8">By a vigorous application of his pole Hans sent us flying over the water. The raft was quite twenty fathoms distant.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It was a moment of palpitating interest, of deep anxiety. My uncle, the Professor, never took his eyes off the chronometer.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Only five minutes more," he said in a low tone, "only four, only three."</p>
<p class="calibre8">My pulse went a hundred to the minute. I could hear my heart beating.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Only two, one! Now, then, mountains of granite, crumble beneath the power of man!"</p>
<p class="calibre8">What happened after that? As to the terrific roar of the explosion, I do not think I heard it. But the form of the rocks completely changed in my eyes—they seemed to be drawn aside like a curtain. I saw a fathomless, a bottomless abyss, which yawned beneath the turgid waves. The sea, which seemed suddenly to have gone mad, then became one great mountainous mass, upon the top of which the raft rose perpendicularly.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We were all thrown down. In less than a second the light gave place to the most profound obscurity. Then I felt all solid support give way not to my feet, but to the raft itself. I thought it was going bodily down a tremendous well. I tried to speak, to question my uncle. Nothing could be heard but the roaring of the mighty waves. We clung together in utter silence.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Despite the awful darkness, despite the noise, the surprise, the emotion, I thoroughly understood what had happened.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Beyond the rock which had been blown up, there existed a mighty abyss. The explosion had caused a kind of earthquake in this soil, broken by fissures and rents. The gulf, thus suddenly thrown open, was about to swallow the inland sea which, transformed into a mighty torrent, was dragging us with it.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Only one idea filled my mind. We were utterly and completely lost!</p>
<p class="calibre8">One hour, two hours—what more I cannot say, passed in this manner. We sat close together, elbow touching elbow, knee touching knee! We held one another's hands not to be thrown off the raft. We were subjected to the most violent shocks, whenever our sole dependence, a frail wooden raft, struck against the rocky sides of the channel. Fortunately for us, these concussions became less and less frequent, which made me fancy that the gallery was getting wider and wider. There could be now no doubt that we had chanced upon the road once followed by Saknussemm, but instead of going down in a proper manner, we had, through our own imprudence, drawn a whole sea with us!</p>
<p class="calibre8">These ideas presented themselves to my mind in a very vague and obscure manner. I felt rather than reasoned. I put my ideas together only confusedly, while spinning along like a man going down a waterfall. To judge by the air which, as it were, whipped my face, we must have been rushing at a perfectly lightning rate.</p>
<p class="calibre8">To attempt under these circumstances to light a torch was simply impossible, and the last remains of our electric machine, of our Ruhmkorff coil, had been destroyed during the fearful explosion.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I was therefore very much confused to see at last a bright light shining close to me. The calm countenance of the guide seemed to gleam upon me. The clever and patient hunter had succeeded in lighting the lantern; and though, in the keen and thorough draft, the flame flickered and vacillated and was nearly put out, it served partially to dissipate the awful obscurity.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The gallery into which we had entered was very wide. I was, therefore, quite right in that part of my conjecture. The insufficient light did not allow us to see both of the walls at the same time. The slope of waters, which was carrying us away, was far greater than that of the most rapid river of America. The whole surface of the stream seemed to be composed of liquid arrows, darted forward with extreme violence and power. I can give no idea of the impression it made upon me.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The raft, at times, caught in certain whirlpools, and rushed forward, yet turned on itself all the time. How it did not upset I shall never be able to understand. When it approached the sides of the gallery, I took care to throw upon them the light of the lantern, and I was able to judge of the rapidity of motion by looking at the projecting masses of rock, which as soon as seen were again invisible. So rapid was our progress that points of rock at a considerable distance one from the other appeared like portions of transverse lines, which enclosed us in a kind of net, like that of a line of telegraphic wires.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I believe we were now going at a rate of not less than a hundred miles an hour.</p>
<p class="calibre8">My uncle and I looked at one another with wild and haggard eyes; we clung convulsively to the stump of the mast, which, at the moment when the catastrophe took place, had snapped short off. We turned our backs as much as possible to the wind, in order not to be stifled by a rapidity of motion which nothing human could face and live.</p>
<p class="calibre8">And still the long monotonous hours went on. The situation did not change in the least, though a discovery I suddenly made seemed to complicate it very much.</p>
<p class="calibre8">When we had slightly recovered our equilibrium, I proceeded to examine our cargo. I then made the unsatisfactory discovery that the greater part of it had utterly disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I became alarmed, and determined to discover what were our resources. My heart beat at the idea, but it was absolutely necessary to know on what we had to depend. With this view, I took the lantern and looked around.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Of all our former collection of nautical and philosophical instruments, there remained only the chronometer and the compass. The ladders and ropes were reduced to a small piece of rope fastened to the stump of the mast. Not a pickax, not a crowbar, not a hammer, and, far worse than all, no food—not enough for one day!</p>
<p class="calibre8">This discovery was a prelude to a certain and horrible death.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Seated gloomily on the raft, clasping the stump of the mast mechanically, I thought of all I had read as to sufferings from starvation.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I remembered everything that history had taught me on the subject, and I shuddered at the remembrance of the agonies to be endured.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Maddened at the prospects of enduring the miseries of starvation, I persuaded myself that I must be mistaken. I examined the cracks in the raft; I poked between the joints and beams; I examined every possible hole and corner. The result was—simply nothing!</p>
<p class="calibre8">Our stock of provisions consisted of nothing but a piece of dry meat and some soaked and half-moldy biscuits.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I gazed around me scared and frightened. I could not understand the awful truth. And yet of what consequence was it in regard to any new danger? Supposing that we had had provisions for months, and even for years, how could we ever get out of the awful abyss into which we were being hurled by the irresistible torrent we had let loose?</p>
<p class="calibre8">Why should we trouble ourselves about the sufferings and tortures to be endured from hunger when death stared us in the face under so many other swifter and perhaps even more horrid forms?</p>
<p class="calibre8">It was very doubtful, under the circumstances in which we were placed, if we should have time to die of inanition.</p>
<p class="calibre8">But the human frame is singularly constituted.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I know not how it was; but, from some singular hallucination of the mind, I forgot the real, serious, and immediate danger to which we were exposed, to think of the menaces of the future, which appeared before us in all their naked terror. Besides, after all, suggested Hope, perhaps we might finally escape the fury of the raging torrent, and once more revisit the glimpses of the moon, on the surface of our beautiful Mother Earth.</p>
<p class="calibre8">How was it to be done? I had not the remotest idea. Where were we to come out? No matter, so that we did.</p>
<p class="calibre8">One chance in a thousand is always a chance, while death from hunger gave us not even the faintest glimpse of hope. It left to the imagination nothing but blank horror, without the faintest chance of escape!</p>
<p class="calibre8">I had the greatest mind to reveal all to my uncle, to explain to him the extraordinary and wretched position to which we were reduced, in order that, between the two, we might make a calculation as to the exact space of time which remained for us to live.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It was, it appeared to me, the only thing to be done. But I had the courage to hold my tongue, to gnaw at my entrails like the Spartan boy. I wished to leave him all his coolness.</p>
<p class="calibre8">At this moment, the light of the lantern slowly fell, and at last went out!</p>
<p class="calibre8">The wick had wholly burnt to an end. The obscurity became absolute. It was no longer possible to see through the impenetrable darkness! There was one torch left, but it was impossible to keep it alight. Then, like a child, I shut my eyes, that I might not see the darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre8">After a great lapse of time, the rapidity of our journey increased. I could feel it by the rush of air upon my face. The slope of the waters was excessive. I began to feel that we were no longer going down a slope; we were falling. I felt as one does in a dream, going down bodily—falling; falling; falling!</p>
<p class="calibre8">I felt that the hands of my uncle and Hans were vigorously clasping my arms.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Suddenly, after a lapse of time scarcely appreciable, I felt something like a shock. The raft had not struck a hard body, but had suddenly been checked in its course. A waterspout, a liquid column of water, fell upon us. I felt suffocating. I was being drowned.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Still the sudden inundation did not last. In a few seconds I felt myself once more able to breathe. My uncle and Hans pressed my arms, and the raft carried us all three away.</p>

<h4 id="pgepubid00081" class="calibre7">THE APE GIGANS</h4>
<p class="calibre8">It is difficult for me to determine what was the real time, but I should suppose, by after calculation, that it must have been ten at night.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I lay in a stupor, a half dream, during which I saw visions of astounding character. Monsters of the deep were side by side with the mighty elephantine shepherd. Gigantic fish and animals seemed to form strange conjunctions.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The raft took a sudden turn, whirled round, entered another tunnel—this time illumined in a most singular manner. The roof was formed of porous stalactite, through which a moonlit vapor appeared to pass, casting its brilliant light upon our gaunt and haggard figures. The light increased as we advanced, while the roof ascended; until at last, we were once more in a kind of water cavern, the lofty dome of which disappeared in a luminous cloud!</p>
<p class="calibre8">A rugged cavern of small extent appeared to offer a halting place to our weary bodies.</p>
<p class="calibre8">My uncle and the guide moved as men in a dream. I was afraid to waken them, knowing the danger of such a sudden start. I seated myself beside them to watch.</p>
<p class="calibre8">As I did so, I became aware of something moving in the distance, which at once fascinated my eyes. It was floating, apparently, upon the surface of the water, advancing by means of what at first appeared paddles. I looked with glaring eyes. One glance told me that it was something monstrous.</p>
<p class="calibre8">But what?</p>
<p class="calibre8">It was the great "shark-crocodile" of the early writers on geology. About the size of an ordinary whale, with hideous jaws and two gigantic eyes, it advanced. Its eyes fixed on me with terrible sternness. Some indefinite warning told me that it had marked me for its own.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I attempted to rise—to escape, no matter where, but my knees shook under me; my limbs trembled violently; I almost lost my senses. And still the mighty monster advanced. My uncle and the guide made no effort to save themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre8">With a strange noise, like none other I had ever heard, the beast came on. His jaws were at least seven feet apart, and his distended mouth looked large enough to have swallowed a boatful of men.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We were about ten feet distant when I discovered that much as his body resembled that of a crocodile, his mouth was wholly that of a shark.</p>
<p class="calibre8">His twofold nature now became apparent. To snatch us up at a mouthful it was necessary for him to turn on his back, which motion necessarily caused his legs to kick up helplessly in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I actually laughed even in the very jaws of death!</p>
<p class="calibre8">But next minute, with a wild cry, I darted away into the interior of the cave, leaving my unhappy comrades to their fate! This cavern was deep and dreary. After about a hundred yards, I paused and looked around.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The whole floor, composed of sand and malachite, was strewn with bones, freshly gnawed bones of reptiles and fish, with a mixture of mammalia. My very soul grew sick as my body shuddered with horror. I had truly, according to the old proverb, fallen out of the frying pan into the fire. Some beast larger and more ferocious even than the shark-crocodile inhabited this den.</p>
<p class="calibre8">What could I do? The mouth of the cave was guarded by one ferocious monster, the interior was inhabited by something too hideous to contemplate. Flight was impossible!</p>
<p class="calibre8">Only one resource remained, and that was to find some small hiding place to which the fearful denizens of the cavern could not penetrate. I gazed wildly around, and at last discovered a fissure in the rock, to which I rushed in the hope of recovering my scattered senses.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Crouching down, I waited shivering as in an ague fit. No man is brave in presence of an earthquake, or a bursting boiler, or an exploding torpedo. I could not be expected to feel much courage in presence of the fearful fate that appeared to await me.</p>
<p class="calibre8">An hour passed. I heard all the time a strange rumbling outside the cave.</p>
<p class="calibre8">What was the fate of my unhappy companions? It was impossible for me to pause to inquire. My own wretched existence was all I could think of.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Suddenly a groaning, as of fifty bears in a fight, fell upon my ears—hisses, spitting, moaning, hideous to hear—and then I saw—</p>
<p class="calibre8">Never, were ages to pass over my head, shall I forget the horrible apparition.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It was the Ape Gigans!</p>
<p class="calibre8">Fourteen feet high, covered with coarse hair, of a blackish brown, the hair on the arms, from the shoulder to the elbow joints, pointing downwards, while that from the wrist to the elbow pointed upwards, it advanced. Its arms were as long as its body, while its legs were prodigious. It had thick, long, and sharply pointed teeth—like a mammoth saw.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It struck its breast as it came on smelling and sniffing, reminding me of the stories we read in our early childhood of giants who ate the Flesh of men and little boys!</p>
<p class="calibre8">Suddenly it stopped. My heart beat wildly, for I was conscious that, somehow or other, the fearful monster had smelled me out and was peering about with his hideous eyes to try and discover my whereabouts.</p>
<p class="calibre8">My reading, which as a rule is a blessing, but which on this occasion, seemed momentarily to prove a curse, told me the real truth. It was the Ape Gigans, the antediluvian gorilla.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Yes! This awful monster, confined by good fortune to the interior of the earth, was the progenitor of the hideous monster of Africa.</p>
<p class="calibre8">He glared wildly about, seeking something—doubtless myself. I gave myself up for lost. No hope of safety or escape seemed to remain.</p>
<p class="calibre8">At this moment, just as my eyes appeared to close in death, there came a strange noise from the entrance of the cave; and turning, the gorilla evidently recognized some enemy more worthy his prodigious size and strength. It was the huge shark-crocodile, which perhaps having disposed of my friends, was coming in search of further prey.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The gorilla placed himself on the defensive, and clutching a bone some seven or eight feet in length, a perfect club, aimed a deadly blow at the hideous beast, which reared upwards and fell with all its weight upon its adversary.</p>
<p class="calibre8">A terrible combat, the details of which it is impossible to give, now ensued. The struggle was awful and ferocious, I, however, did not wait to witness the result. Regarding myself as the object of contention, I determined to remove from the presence of the victor. I slid down from my hiding place, reached the ground, and gliding against the wall, strove to gain the open mouth of the cavern.</p>
<p class="calibre8">But I had not taken many steps when the fearful clamor ceased, to be followed by a mumbling and groaning which appeared to be indicative of victory.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I looked back and saw the huge ape, gory with blood, coming after me with glaring eyes, with dilated nostrils that gave forth two columns of heated vapor. I could feel his hot and fetid breath on my neck; and with a horrid jump—awoke from my nightmare sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Yes—it was all a dream. I was still on the raft with my uncle and the guide.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The relief was not instantaneous, for under the influence of the hideous nightmare my senses had become numbed. After a while, however, my feelings were tranquilized. The first of my perceptions which returned in full force was that of hearing. I listened with acute and attentive ears. All was still as death. All I comprehended was silence. To the roaring of the waters, which had filled the gallery with awful reverberations, succeeded perfect peace.</p>
<p class="calibre8">After some little time my uncle spoke, in a low and scarcely audible tone: "Harry, boy, where are you?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"I am here," was my faint rejoinder.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, don't you see what has happened? We are going upwards."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"My dear uncle, what can you mean?" was my half-delirious reply.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes, I tell you we are ascending rapidly. Our downward journey is quite checked."</p>
<p class="calibre8">I held out my hand, and, after some little difficulty, succeeded in touching the wall. My hand was in an instant covered with blood. The skin was torn from the flesh. We were ascending with extraordinary rapidity.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"The torch—the torch!" cried the Professor, wildly; "it must be lighted."</p>
<p class="calibre8">Hans, the guide, after many vain efforts, at last succeeded in lighting it, and the flame, having now nothing to prevent its burning, shed a tolerably clear light. We were enabled to form an approximate idea of the truth.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"It is just as I thought," said my uncle, after a moment or two of silent attention. "We are in a narrow well about four fathoms square. The waters of the great inland sea, having reached the bottom of the gulf are now forcing themselves up the mighty shaft. As a natural consequence, we are being cast upon the summit of the waters."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"That I can see," was my lugubrious reply; "but where will this shaft end, and to what fall are we likely to be exposed?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Of that I am as ignorant as yourself. All I know is, that we should be prepared for the worst. We are going up at a fearfully rapid rate. As far as I can judge, we are ascending at the rate of two fathoms a second, of a hundred and twenty fathoms a minute, or rather more than three and a half leagues an hour. At this rate, our fate will soon be a matter of certainty."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"No doubt of it," was my reply. "The great concern I have now, however, is to know whether this shaft has any issue. It may end in a granite roof—in which case we shall be suffocated by compressed air, or dashed to atoms against the top. I fancy, already, that the air is beginning to be close and condensed. I have a difficulty in breathing."</p>
<p class="calibre8">This might be fancy, or it might be the effect of our rapid motion, but I certainly felt a great oppression of the chest.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Henry," said the Professor, "I do believe that the situation is to a certain extent desperate. There remain, however, many chances of ultimate safety, and I have, in my own mind, been revolving them over, during your heavy but agitated sleep. I have come to this logical conclusion—whereas we may at any moment perish, so at any moment we may be saved! We need, therefore, prepare ourselves for whatever may turn up in the great chapter of accidents."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"But what would you have us do?" I cried. "Are we not utterly helpless?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"No! While there is life there is hope. At all events, there is one thing we can do—eat, and thus obtain strength to face victory or death."</p>
<p class="calibre8">As he spoke, I looked at my uncle with a haggard glance. I had put off the fatal communication as long as possible. It was now forced upon me, and I must tell him the truth.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Still I hesitated.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Eat," I said, in a deprecating tone as if there were no hurry.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes, and at once. I feel like a starving prisoner," he said, rubbing his yellow and shivering hands together.</p>
<p class="calibre8">And, turning round to the guide, he spoke some hearty, cheering words, as I judged from his tone, in Danish. Hans shook his head in a terribly significant manner. I tried to look unconcerned.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"What!" cried the Professor, "you do not mean to say that all our provisions are lost?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes," was my lowly spoken reply, as I held out something in my hand, "this morsel of dried meat is all that remains for us three."</p>
<p class="calibre8">My uncle gazed at me as if he could not fully appreciate the meaning of my words. The blow seemed to stun him by its severity. I allowed him to reflect for some moments.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well," said I, after a short pause, "what do you think now? Is there any chance of our escaping from our horrible subterranean dangers? Are we not doomed to perish in the great hollows of the centre of the earth?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">But my pertinent questions brought no answer. My uncle either heard me not, or appeared not to do so.</p>
<p class="calibre8">And in this way a whole hour passed. Neither of us cared to speak. For myself, I began to feel the most fearful and devouring hunger. My companions, doubtless, felt the same horrible tortures, but neither of them would touch the wretched morsel of meat that remained. It lay there, a last remnant of all our great preparations for the mad and senseless journey!</p>
<p class="calibre8">I looked back, with wonderment, to my own folly. Fully was I aware that, despite his enthusiasm, and the ever-to-be-hated scroll of Saknussemm, my uncle should never have started on his perilous voyage. What memories of the happy past, what previsions of the horrible future, now filled my brain!</p>
<hr class="c"/>

<h4 id="pgepubid00083" class="calibre7">HUNGER</h4>
<p class="calibre8">Hunger, prolonged, is temporary madness! The brain is at work without its required food, and the most fantastic notions fill the mind. Hitherto I had never known what hunger really meant. I was likely to understand it now.</p>
<p class="calibre8">And yet, three months before I could tell my terrible story of starvation, as I thought it. As a boy I used to make frequent excursions in the neighborhood of the Professor's house.</p>
<p class="calibre8">My uncle always acted on system, and he believed that, in addition to the day of rest and worship, there should be a day of recreation. In consequence, I was always free to do as I liked on a Wednesday.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Now, as I had a notion to combine the useful and the agreeable, my favorite pastime was birds' nesting. I had one of the best collections of eggs in all the town. They were classified, and under glass cases.</p>
<p class="calibre8">There was a certain wood, which, by rising at early morn, and taking the cheap train, I could reach at eleven in the morning. Here I would botanize or geologize at my will. My uncle was always glad of specimens for his herbarium, and stones to examine. When I had filled my wallet, I proceeded to search for nests.</p>
<p class="calibre8">After about two hours of hard work, I, one day, sat down by a stream to eat my humble but copious lunch. How the remembrance of the spiced sausage, the wheaten loaf, and the beer, made my mouth water now! I would have given every prospect of worldly wealth for such a meal. But to my story.</p>
<p class="calibre8">While seated thus at my leisure, I looked up at the ruins of an old castle, at no great distance. It was the remains of an historical dwelling, ivy-clad, and now falling to pieces.</p>
<p class="calibre8">While looking, I saw two eagles circling about the summit of a lofty tower. I soon became satisfied that there was a nest. Now, in all my collection, I lacked eggs of the native eagle and the large owl.</p>
<p class="calibre8">My mind was made up. I would reach the summit of that tower, or perish in the attempt. I went nearer, and surveyed the ruins. The old staircase, years before, had fallen in. The outer walls were, however, intact. There was no chance that way, unless I looked to the ivy solely for support. This was, as I soon found out, futile.</p>
<p class="calibre8">There remained the chimney, which still went up to the top, and had once served to carry off the smoke from every story of the tower.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Up this I determined to venture. It was narrow, rough, and therefore the more easily climbed. I took off my coat and crept into the chimney. Looking up, I saw a small, light opening, proclaiming the summit of the chimney.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Up—up I went, for some time using my hands and knees, after the fashion of a chimney sweep. It was slow work, but, there being continual projections, the task was comparatively easy. In this way, I reached halfway. The chimney now became narrower. The atmosphere was close, and, at last, to end the matter, I stuck fast. I could ascend no higher.</p>
<p class="calibre8">There could be no doubt of this, and there remained no resource but to descend, and give up my glorious prey in despair. I yielded to fate and endeavored to descend. But I could not move. Some unseen and mysterious obstacle intervened and stopped me. In an instant the full horror of my situation seized me.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I was unable to move either way, and was doomed to a terrible and horrible death, that of starvation. In a boy's mind, however, there is an extraordinary amount of elasticity and hope, and I began to think of all sorts of plans to escape my gloomy fate.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In the first place, I required no food just at present, having had an excellent meal, and was therefore allowed time for reflection. My first thought was to try and move the mortar with my hand. Had I possessed a knife, something might have been done, but that useful instrument I had left in my coat pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I soon found that all efforts of this kind were vain and useless, and that all I could hope to do was to wriggle downwards.</p>
<p class="calibre8">But though I jerked and struggled, and strove to turn, it was all in vain. I could not move an inch, one way or the other. And time flew rapidly. My early rising probably contributed to the fact that I felt sleepy, and gradually gave way to the sensation of drowsiness.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I slept, and awoke in darkness, ravenously hungry.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Night had come, and still I could not move. I was tight bound, and did not succeed in changing my position an inch. I groaned aloud. Never since the days of my happy childhood, when it was a hardship to go from meal to meal without eating, had I really experienced hunger. The sensation was as novel as it was painful. I began now to lose my head and to scream and cry out in my agony. Something appeared, startled by my noise. It was a harmless lizard, but it appeared to me a loathsome reptile. Again I made the old ruins resound with my cries, and finally so exhausted myself that I fainted.</p>
<p class="calibre8">How long I lay in a kind of trance or sleep I cannot say, but when again I recovered consciousness it was day. How ill I felt, how hunger still gnawed at me, it would be hard to say. I was too weak to scream now, far too weak to struggle.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Suddenly I was startled by a roar.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Are you there, Henry?" said the voice of my uncle; "are you there, my boy?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">I could only faintly respond, but I also made a desperate effort to turn. Some mortar fell. To this I owed my being discovered. When the search took place, it was easily seen that mortar and small pieces of stone had recently fallen from above. Hence my uncle's cry.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Be calm," he cried, "if we pull down the whole ruin, you shall be saved."</p>
<p class="calibre8">They were delicious words, but I had little hope.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Soon however, about a quarter of an hour later I heard a voice above me, at one of the upper fireplaces.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Are you below or above?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Below," was my reply.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In an instant a basket was lowered with milk, a biscuit, and an egg. My uncle was fearful to be too ready with his supply of food. I drank the milk first, for thirst had nearly deadened hunger. I then, much refreshed, ate my bread and hard egg.</p>
<p class="calibre8">They were now at work at the wall. I could hear a pickax. Wishing to escape all danger from this terrible weapon I made a desperate struggle, and the belt, which surrounded my waist and which had been hitched on a stone, gave way. I was free, and only escaped falling down by a rapid motion of my hands and knees.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In ten minutes more I was in my uncle's arms, after being two days and nights in that horrible prison. My occasional delirium prevented me from counting time.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I was weeks recovering from that awful starvation adventure; and yet what was that to the hideous sufferings I now endured?</p>
<p class="calibre8">After dreaming for some time, and thinking of this and other matters, I once more looked around me. We were still ascending with fearful rapidity. Every now and then the air appeared to check our respiration as it does that of aeronauts when the ascension of the balloon is too rapid. But if they feel a degree of cold in proportion to the elevation they attain in the atmosphere, we experienced quite a contrary effect. The heat began to increase in a most threatening and exceptional manner. I cannot tell exactly the mean, but I think it must have reached one hundred twenty-two degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p class="calibre8">What was the meaning of this extraordinary change in the temperature? As far as we had hitherto gone, facts had proved the theories of Davy and of Lidenbrock to be correct. Until now, all the peculiar conditions of refractory rocks, of electricity, of magnetism, had modified the general laws of nature, and had created for us a moderate temperature; for the theory of the central fire, remained, in my eyes, the only explainable one.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Were we, then, going to reach a position in which these phenomena were to be carried out in all their rigor, and in which the heat would reduce the rocks to a state of fusion?</p>
<p class="calibre8">Such was my not unnatural fear, and I did not conceal the fact from my uncle. My way of doing so might be cold and heartless, but I could not help it.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"If we are not drowned, or smashed into pancakes, and if we do not die of starvation, we have the satisfaction of knowing that we must be burned alive."</p>
<p class="calibre8">My uncle, in presence of this brusque attack, simply shrugged his shoulders, and resumed his reflections—whatever they might be.</p>
<p class="calibre8">An hour passed away, and except that there was a slight increase in the temperature no incident modified the situation.</p>
<p class="calibre8">My uncle at last, of his own accord, broke silence.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, Henry, my boy," he said, in a cheerful way, "we must make up our minds."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Make up our minds to what?" I asked, in considerable surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well—to something. We must at whatever risk recruit our physical strength. If we make the fatal mistake of husbanding our little remnant of food, we may probably prolong our wretched existence a few hours—but we shall remain weak to the end."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes," I growled, "to the end. That, however, will not keep us long waiting."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, only let a chance of safety present itself—only allow that a moment of action be necessary—where shall we find the means of action if we allow ourselves to be reduced to physical weakness by inanition?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"When this piece of meat is devoured, Uncle, what hope will there remain unto us?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"None, my dear Henry, none. But will it do you any good to devour it with your eyes? You appear to me to reason like one without will or decision, like a being without energy."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Then," cried I, exasperated to a degree which is scarcely to be explained, "you do not mean to tell me—that you—that you—have not lost all hope."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Certainly not," replied the Professor with consummate coolness.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"You mean to tell me, Uncle, that we shall get out of this monstrous subterranean shaft?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"While there is life there is hope. I beg to assert, Henry, that as long as a man's heart beats, as long as a man's flesh quivers, I do not allow that a being gifted with thought and will can allow himself to despair."</p>
<p class="calibre8">What a nerve! The man placed in a position like that we occupied must have been very brave to speak like this.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well," I cried, "what do you mean to do?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Eat what remains of the food we have in our hands; let us swallow the last crumb. It will bel Heaven willing, our last repast. Well, never mind—instead of being exhausted skeletons, we shall be men."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"True," muttered I in a despairing tone, "let us take our fill."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"We must," replied my uncle, with a deep sigh, "call it what you will."</p>
<p class="calibre8">My uncle took a piece of the meat that remained, and some crusts of biscuit which had escaped the wreck. He divided the whole into three parts.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Each had one pound of food to last him as long as he remained in the interior of the earth.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Each now acted in accordance with his own private character.</p>
<p class="calibre8">My uncle, the Professor, ate greedily, but evidently without appetite, eating simply from some mechanical motion. I put the food inside my lips, and hungry as I was, chewed my morsel without pleasure, and without satisfaction.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Hans, the guide, just as if he had been eider-down hunting, swallowed every mouthful, as though it were a usual affair. He looked like a man equally prepared to enjoy superfluity or total want.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Hans, in all probability, was no more used to starvation than ourselves, but his hardy Icelandic nature had prepared him for many sufferings. As long as he received his three rix-dollars every Saturday night, he was prepared for anything.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The fact was, Hans never troubled himself about much except his money. He had undertaken to serve a certain man at so much per week, and no matter what evils befell his employer or himself, he never found fault or grumbled, so long as his wages were duly paid.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Suddenly my uncle roused himself. He had seen a smile on the face of our guide. I could not make it out.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"What is the matter?" said my uncle.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Schiedam," said the guide, producing a bottle of this precious fluid.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We drank. My uncle and myself will own to our dying day that hence we derived strength to exist until the last bitter moment. That precious bottle of Hollands was in reality only half full; but, under the circumstances, it was nectar.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It took some minutes for myself and my uncle to form a decided opinion on the subject. The worthy Professor swallowed about half a pint and did not seem able to drink any more.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"<i class="calibre5">Fortrafflig</i>," said Hans, swallowing nearly all that was left.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Excellent—very good," said my uncle, with as much gusto as if he had just left the steps of the club at Hamburg.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I had begun to feel as if there had been one gleam of hope. Now all thought of the future vanished!</p>
<p class="calibre8">We had consumed our last ounce of food, and it was five o'clock in the morning!</p>
