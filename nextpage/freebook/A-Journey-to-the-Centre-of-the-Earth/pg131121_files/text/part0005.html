<p class="calibre8"><a id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="part0004.html#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The declination is the variation of the needle from the true meridian of a place.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote">
<p class="calibre8"><a id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="part0004.html#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Inclination is the dip of the magnetic needle with a tendency to incline towards the earth.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">"What may that be, Uncle? Your information interests me."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Why, that the needle instead of dipping towards the pole as it does on earth, in the northern hemisphere, has an upward tendency."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"This proves," I cried, "that the great point of magnetic attraction lies somewhere between the surface of the earth and the spot we have succeeded in reaching."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Exactly, my observant nephew," exclaimed my uncle, elated and delighted, "and it is quite probable that if we succeed in getting toward the polar regions—somewhere near the seventy-third degree of latitude, where Sir James Ross discovered the magnetic pole, we shall behold the needle point directly upward. We have therefore discovered by analogy, that this great centre of attraction is not situated at a very great depth."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well," said I, rather surprised, "this discovery will astonish experimental philosophers. It was never suspected."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Science, great, mighty and in the end unerring," replied my uncle dogmatically, "science has fallen into many errors—errors which have been fortunate and useful rather than otherwise, for they have been the steppingstones to truth."</p>
<p class="calibre8">After some further discussion, I turned to another matter.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Have you any idea of the depth we have reached?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"We are now," continued the Professor, "exactly thirty-five leagues—above a hundred miles—down into the interior of the earth."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"So," said I, after measuring the distance on the map, "we are now beneath the Scottish Highlands, and have over our heads the lofty Grampian Hills."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"You are quite right," said the Professor, laughing; "it sounds very alarming, the weight being heavy—but the vault which supports this vast mass of earth and rock is solid and safe; the mighty Architect of the Universe has constructed it of solid materials. Man, even in his highest flights of vivid and poetic imagination, never thought of such things! What are the finest arches of our bridges, what the vaulted roofs of our cathedrals, to that mighty dome above us, and beneath which floats an ocean with its storms and calms and tides!"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"I admire it all as much as you can, Uncle, and have no fear that our granite sky will fall upon our heads. But now that we have discussed matters of science and discovery, what are your future intentions? Are you not thinking of getting back to the surface of our beautiful earth?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">This was said more as a feeler than with any hope of success.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Go back, nephew," cried my uncle in a tone of alarm, "you are not surely thinking of anything so absurd or cowardly. No, my intention is to advance and continue our journey. We have as yet been singularly fortunate, and henceforth I hope we shall be more so."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"But," said I, "how are we to cross yonder liquid plain?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"It is not my intention to leap into it head foremost, or even to swim across it, like Leander over the Hellespont. But as oceans are, after all, only great lakes, inasmuch as they are surrounded by land, so does it stand to reason, that this central sea is circumscribed by granite surroundings."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Doubtless," was my natural reply.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, then, do you not think that when once we reach the other end, we shall find some means of continuing our journey?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Probably, but what extent do you allow to this internal ocean?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, I should fancy it to extend about forty or fifty leagues—more or less."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"But even supposing this approximation to be a correct one—what then?" I asked.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"My dear boy, we have no time for further discussion. We shall embark tomorrow."</p>
<p class="calibre8">I looked around with surprise and incredulity. I could see nothing in the shape of boat or vessel.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"What!" I cried, "we are about to launch out upon an unknown sea; and where, if I may ask, is the vessel to carry us?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, my dear boy, it will not be exactly what you would call a vessel. For the present we must be content with a good and solid raft."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"A raft," I cried, incredulously, "but down here a raft is as impossible of construction as a vessel—and I am at a loss to imagine—"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"My good Harry—if you were to listen instead of talking so much, you would hear," said my uncle, waxing a little impatient.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"I should hear?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes—certain knocks with the hammer, which Hans is now employing to make the raft. He has been at work for many hours."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Making a raft?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"But where has he found trees suitable for such a construction?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"He found the trees all ready to his hand. Come, and you shall see our excellent guide at work."</p>
<p class="calibre8">More and more amazed at what I heard and saw, I followed my uncle like one in a dream.</p>
<p class="calibre8">After a walk of about a quarter of an hour, I saw Hans at work on the other side of the promontory which formed our natural port. A few minutes more and I was beside him. To my great surprise, on the sandy shore lay a half-finished raft. It was made from beams of a very peculiar wood, and a great number of limbs, joints, boughs, and pieces lay about, sufficient to have constructed a fleet of ships and boats.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I turned to my uncle, silent with astonishment and awe.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Where did all this wood come from?" I cried; "what wood is it?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, there is pinewood, fir, and the palms of the northern regions, mineralized by the action of the sea," he replied, sententiously.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Can it be possible?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes," said the learned Professor, "what you see is called fossil wood."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"But then," cried I, after reflecting for a moment, "like the lignites, it must be as hard and as heavy as iron, and therefore will certainly not float."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Sometimes that is the case. Many of these woods have become true anthracites, but others again, like those you see before you, have only undergone one phase of fossil transformation. But there is no proof like demonstration," added my uncle, picking one or two of these precious waifs and casting them into the sea.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The piece of wood, after having disappeared for a moment, came to the surface, and floated about with the oscillation produced by wind and tide.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Are you convinced?" said my uncle, with a self-satisfied smile.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"I am convinced," I cried, "that what I see is incredible."</p>
<p class="calibre8">The fact was that my journey into the interior of the earth was rapidly changing all preconceived notions, and day by day preparing me for the marvelous.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I should not have been surprised to have seen a fleet of native canoes afloat upon that silent sea.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The very next evening, thanks to the industry and ability of Hans, the raft was finished. It was about ten feet long and five feet wide. The beams bound together with stout ropes, were solid and firm, and once launched by our united efforts, the improvised vessel floated tranquilly upon the waters of what the Professor had well named the Central Sea.</p>

<h4 id="pgepubid00059" class="calibre7">ON THE WATERS—A RAFT VOYAGE</h4>
<p class="calibre8">On the thirteenth of August we were up betimes. There was no time to be lost. We now had to inaugurate a new kind of locomotion, which would have the advantage of being rapid and not fatiguing.</p>
<p class="calibre8">A mast, made of two pieces of wood fastened together, to give additional strength, a yard made from another one, the sail a linen sheet from our bed. We were fortunately in no want of cordage, and the whole on trial appeared solid and seaworthy.</p>
<p class="calibre8">At six o'clock in the morning, when the eager and enthusiastic Professor gave the signal to embark, the victuals, the luggage, all our instruments, our weapons, and a goodly supply of sweet water, which we had collected from springs in the rocks, were placed on the raft.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Hans had, with considerable ingenuity, contrived a rudder, which enabled him to guide the floating apparatus with ease. He took the tiller, as a matter of course. The worthy man was as good a sailor as he was a guide and duck hunter. I then let go the painter which held us to the shore, the sail was brought to the wind, and we made a rapid offing.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Our sea voyage had at length commenced; and once more we were making for distant and unknown regions.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Just as we were about to leave the little port where the raft had been constructed, my uncle, who was very strong as to geographic nomenclature, wanted to give it a name, and among others, suggested mine.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well," said I, "before you decide I have another to propose."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well; out with it."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"I should like to call it Gretchen. Port Gretchen will sound very well on our future map."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well then, Port Gretchen let it be," said the Professor.</p>
<p class="calibre8">And thus it was that the memory of my dear girl was attached to our adventurous and memorable expedition.</p>
<p class="calibre8">When we left the shore the wind was blowing from the northward and eastward. We went directly before the wind at a much greater speed than might have been expected from a raft. The dense layers of atmosphere at that depth had great propelling power and acted upon the sail with considerable force.</p>
<p class="calibre8">At the end of an hour, my uncle, who had been taking careful observations, was enabled to judge of the rapidity with which we moved. It was far beyond anything seen in the upper world.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"If," he said, "we continue to advance at our present rate, we shall have traveled at least thirty leagues in twenty-four hours. With a mere raft this is an almost incredible velocity."</p>
<p class="calibre8">I certainly was surprised, and without making any reply went forward upon the raft. Already the northern shore was fading away on the edge of the horizon. The two shores appeared to separate more and more, leaving a wide and open space for our departure. Before me I could see nothing but the vast and apparently limitless sea—upon which we floated—the only living objects in sight.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Huge and dark clouds cast their grey shadows below—shadows which seemed to crush that colorless and sullen water by their weight. Anything more suggestive of gloom and of regions of nether darkness I never beheld. Silvery rays of electric light, reflected here and there upon some small spots of water, brought up luminous sparkles in the long wake of our cumbrous bark. Presently we were wholly out of sight of land; not a vestige could be seen, nor any indication of where we were going. So still and motionless did we seem without any distant point to fix our eyes on that but for the phosphoric light at the wake of the raft I should have fancied that we were still and motionless.</p>
<p class="calibre8">But I knew that we were advancing at a very rapid rate.</p>
<p class="calibre8">About twelve o'clock in the day, vast collections of seaweed were discovered surrounding us on all sides. I was aware of the extraordinary vegetative power of these plants, which have been known to creep along the bottom of the great ocean, and stop the advance of large ships. But never were seaweeds ever seen, so gigantic and wonderful as those of the Central Sea. I could well imagine how, seen at a distance, tossing and heaving on the summit of the billows, the long lines of algae have been taken for living things, and thus have been fertile sources of the belief in sea serpents.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Our raft swept past great specimens of fucus or seawrack, from three to four thousand feet in length, immense, incredibly long, looking like snakes that stretched out far beyond our horizon. It afforded me great amusement to gaze on their variegated ribbon-like endless lengths. Hour after hour passed without our coming to the termination of these floating weeds. If my astonishment increased, my patience was well-nigh exhausted.</p>
<p class="calibre8">What natural force could possibly have produced such abnormal and extraordinary plants? What must have been the aspect of the globe, during the first centuries of its formation, when under the combined action of heat and humidity, the vegetable kingdom occupied its vast surface to the exclusion of everything else?</p>
<p class="calibre8">These were considerations of never-ending interest for the geologist and the philosopher.</p>
<p class="calibre8">All this while we were advancing on our journey; and at length night came; but as I had remarked the evening before, the luminous state of the atmosphere was in nothing diminished. Whatever was the cause, it was a phenomenon upon the duration of which we could calculate with certainty.</p>
<p class="calibre8">As soon as our supper had been disposed of, and some little speculative conversation indulged in, I stretched myself at the foot of the mast, and presently went to sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Hans remained motionless at the tiller, allowing the raft to rise and fall on the waves. The wind being aft, and the sail square, all he had to do was to keep his oar in the centre.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Ever since we had taken our departure from the newly named Port Gretchen, my worthy uncle had directed me to keep a regular log of our day's navigation, with instructions to put down even the most minute particulars, every interesting and curious phenomenon, the direction of the wind, our rate of sailing, the distance we went; in a word, every incident of our extraordinary voyage.</p>
<p class="calibre8">From our log, therefore, I tell the story of our voyage on the Central Sea.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Friday, August 14th. A steady breeze from the northwest. Raft progressing with extreme rapidity, and going perfectly straight. Coast still dimly visible about thirty leagues to leeward. Nothing to be seen beyond the horizon in front. The extraordinary intensity of the light neither increases nor diminishes. It is singularly stationary. The weather remarkably fine; that is to say, the clouds have ascended very high, and are light and fleecy, and surrounded by an atmosphere resembling silver in fusion.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Thermometer, +32 degrees centigrade.</p>
<p class="calibre8">About twelve o'clock in the day our guide Hans having prepared and baited a hook, cast his line into the subterranean waters. The bait he used was a small piece of meat, by means of which he concealed his hook. Anxious as I was, I was for a long time doomed to disappointment. Were these waters supplied with fish or not? That was the important question. No—was my decided answer. Then there came a sudden and rather hard tug. Hans coolly drew it in, and with it a fish, which struggled violently to escape.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"A fish!" cried my uncle.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"It is a sturgeon!" I cried, "certainly a small sturgeon."</p>
<p class="calibre8">The Professor examined the fish carefully, noting every characteristic; and he did not coincide in my opinion. The fish had a flat head, round body, and the lower extremities covered with bony scales; its mouth was wholly without teeth, the pectoral fins, which were highly developed, sprouted direct from the body, which properly speaking had no tail. The animal certainly belonged to the order in which naturalists class the sturgeon, but it differed from that fish in many essential particulars.</p>
<p class="calibre8">My uncle, after all, was not mistaken. After a long and patient examination, he said:</p>
<p class="calibre8">"This fish, my dear boy, belongs to a family which has been extinct for ages, and of which no trace has ever been found on earth, except fossil remains in the Devonian strata."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"You do not mean to say," I cried, "that we have captured a live specimen of a fish belonging to the primitive stock that existed before the deluge?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"We have," said the Professor, who all this time was continuing his observations, "and you may see by careful examination that these fossil fish have no identity with existing species. To hold in one's hand, therefore, a living specimen of the order, is enough to make a naturalist happy for life."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"But," cried I, "to what family does it belong?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"To the order of Ganoides—an order of fish having angular scales, covered with bright enamel—forming one of the family of the Cephalaspides, of the genus—"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, sir," I remarked, as I noticed my uncle hesitated to conclude.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"To the genus Pterychtis—yes, I am certain of it. Still, though I am confident of the correctness of my surmise, this fish offers to our notice a remarkable peculiarity, never known to exist in any other fish but those which are the natives of subterranean waters, wells, lakes, in caverns, and suchlike hidden pools."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"And what may that be?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"It is blind."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Blind!" I cried, much surprised.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Not only blind," continued the Professor, "but absolutely without organs of sight."</p>
<p class="calibre8">I now examined our discovery for myself. It was singular, to be sure, but it was really a fact. This, however, might be a solitary instance, I suggested. The hook was baited again and once more thrown into the water. This subterranean ocean must have been tolerably well supplied with fish, for in two hours we took a large number of Pterychtis, as well as other fish belonging to another supposed extinct family—the Dipterides (a genus of fish, furnished with two fins only, whence the name), though my uncle could not class it exactly. All, without exception, however, were blind. This unexpected capture enabled us to renew our stock of provisions in a very satisfactory way.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We were now convinced that this subterranean sea contained only fish known to us as fossil specimens—and fish and reptiles alike were all the more perfect the farther back they dated their origin.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We began to hope that we should find some of those saurians which science has succeeded in reconstructing from bits of bone or cartilage.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I took up the telescope and carefully examined the horizon—looked over the whole sea; it was utterly and entirely deserted. Doubtless we were still too near the coast.</p>
<p class="calibre8">After an examination of the ocean, I looked upward, towards the strange and mysterious sky. Why should not one of the birds reconstructed by the immortal Cuvier flap his stupendous wings aloft in the dull strata of subterranean air? It would, of course, find quite sufficient food from the fish in the sea. I gazed for some time upon the void above. It was as silent and as deserted as the shores we had but lately left.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Nevertheless, though I could neither see nor discover anything, my imagination carried me away into wild hypotheses. I was in a kind of waking dream. I thought I saw on the surface of the water those enormous antediluvian turtles as big as floating islands. Upon those dull and somber shores passed a spectral row of the mammifers of early days, the great Liptotherium found in the cavernous hollow of the Brazilian hills, the Mesicotherium, a native of the glacial regions of Siberia.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Farther on, the pachydermatous Lophrodon, that gigantic tapir, which concealed itself behind rocks, ready to do battle for its prey with the Anoplotherium, a singular animal partaking of the nature of the rhinoceros, the horse, the hippopotamus and the camel.</p>
<p class="calibre8">There was the giant Mastodon, twisting and turning his horrid trunk, with which he crushed the rocks of the shore to powder, while the Megatherium—his back raised like a cat in a passion, his enormous claws stretched out, dug into the earth for food, at the same time that he awoke the sonorous echoes of the whole place with his terrible roar.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Higher up still, the first monkey ever seen on the face of the globe clambered, gamboling and playing up the granite hills. Still farther away, ran the Pterodactyl, with the winged hand, gliding or rather sailing through the dense and compressed air like a huge bat.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Above all, near the leaden granitic sky, were immense birds, more powerful than the cassowary and the ostrich, which spread their mighty wings and fluttered against the huge stone vault of the inland sea.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I thought, such was the effect of my imagination, that I saw this whole tribe of antediluvian creatures. I carried myself back to far ages, long before man existed—when, in fact, the earth was in too imperfect a state for him to live upon it.</p>
<p class="calibre8">My dream was of countless ages before the existence of man. The mammifers first disappeared, then the mighty birds, then the reptiles of the secondary period, presently the fish, the crustacea, the mollusks, and finally the vertebrata. The zoophytes of the period of transition in their turn sank into annihilation.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The whole panorama of the world's life before the historic period, seemed to be born over again, and mine was the only human heart that beat in this unpeopled world! There were no more seasons; there were no more climates; the natural heat of the world increased unceasingly, and neutralized that of the great radiant Sun.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Vegetation was exaggerated in an extraordinary manner. I passed like a shadow in the midst of brushwood as lofty as the giant trees of California, and trod underfoot the moist and humid soil, reeking with a rank and varied vegetation.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I leaned against the huge column-like trunks of giant trees, to which those of Canada were as ferns. Whole ages passed, hundreds upon hundreds of years were concentrated into a single day.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Next, unrolled before me like a panorama, came the great and wondrous series of terrestrial transformations. Plants disappeared; the granitic rocks lost all trace of solidity; the liquid state was suddenly substituted for that which had before existed. This was caused by intense heat acting on the organic matter of the earth. The waters flowed over the whole surface of the globe; they boiled; they were volatilized, or turned into vapor; a kind of steam cloud wrapped the whole earth, the globe itself becoming at last nothing but one huge sphere of gas, indescribable in color, between white heat and red, as big and as brilliant as the sun.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In the very centre of this prodigious mass, fourteen hundred thousand times as large as our globe, I was whirled round in space, and brought into close conjunction with the planets. My body was subtilized, or rather became volatile, and commingled in a state of atomic vapor, with the prodigious clouds, which rushed forward like a mighty comet into infinite space!</p>
<p class="calibre8">What an extraordinary dream! Where would it finally take me? My feverish hand began to write down the marvelous details—details more like the imaginings of a lunatic than anything sober and real. I had during this period of hallucination forgotten everything—the Professor, the guide, and the raft on which we were floating. My mind was in a state of semioblivion.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"What is the matter, Harry?" said my uncle suddenly.</p>
<p class="calibre8">My eyes, which were wide opened like those of a somnambulist, were fixed upon him, but I did not see him, nor could I clearly make out anything around me.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Take care, my boy," again cried my uncle, "you will fall into the sea."</p>
<p class="calibre8">As he uttered these words, I felt myself seized on the other side by the firm hand of our devoted guide. Had it not been for the presence of mind of Hans, I must infallibly have fallen into the waves and been drowned.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Have you gone mad?" cried my uncle, shaking me on the other side.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"What—what is the matter?" I said at last, coming to myself.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Are you ill, Henry?" continued the Professor in an anxious tone.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"No—no; but I have had an extraordinary dream. It, however, has passed away. All now seems well," I added, looking around me with strangely puzzled eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"All right," said my uncle; "a beautiful breeze, a splendid sea. We are going along at a rapid rate, and if I am not out in my calculations we shall soon see land. I shall not be sorry to exchange the narrow limits of our raft for the mysterious strand of the subterranean ocean."</p>
<p class="calibre8">As my uncle uttered these words, I rose and carefully scanned the horizon. But the line of water was still confounded with the lowering clouds that hung aloft, and in the distance appeared to touch the edge of the water.</p>

<h4 id="pgepubid00061" class="calibre7">TERRIFIC SAURIAN COMBAT</h4>
<p class="calibre8">Saturday, August 15th. The sea still retains its uniform monotony. The same leaden hue, the same eternal glare from above. No indication of land being in sight. The horizon appears to retreat before us, more and more as we advance.</p>
<p class="calibre8">My head, still dull and heavy from the effects of my extraordinary dream, which I cannot as yet banish from my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The Professor, who has not dreamed, is, however, in one of his morose and unaccountable humors. Spends his time in scanning the horizon, at every point of the compass. His telescope is raised every moment to his eyes, and when he finds nothing to give any clue to our whereabouts, he assumes a Napoleonic attitude and walks anxiously.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I remarked that my uncle, the Professor, had a strong tendency to resume his old impatient character, and I could not but make a note of this disagreeable circumstance in my journal. I saw clearly that it had required all the influence of my danger and suffering, to extract from him one scintillation of humane feeling. Now that I was quite recovered, his original nature had conquered and obtained the upper hand.</p>
<p class="calibre8">And, after all, what had he to be angry and annoyed about, now more than at any other time? Was not the journey being accomplished under the most favorable circumstances? Was not the raft progressing with the most marvelous rapidity?</p>
<p class="calibre8">What, then, could be the matter? After one or two preliminary hems, I determined to inquire.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"You seem uneasy, Uncle," said I, when for about the hundredth time he put down his telescope and walked up and down, muttering to himself.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"No, I am not uneasy," he replied in a dry harsh tone, "by no means."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Perhaps I should have said impatient," I replied, softening the force of my remark.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Enough to make me so, I think."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"And yet we are advancing at a rate seldom attained by a raft," I remarked.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"What matters that?" cried my uncle. "I am not vexed at the rate we go at, but I am annoyed to find the sea so much vaster than I expected."</p>
<p class="calibre8">I then recollected that the Professor, before our departure, had estimated the length of this subterranean ocean as at most about thirty leagues. Now we had traveled at least over thrice that distance without discovering any trace of the distant shore. I began to understand my uncle's anger.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"We are not going down," suddenly exclaimed the Professor. "We are not progressing with our great discoveries. All this is utter loss of time. After all, I did not come from home to undertake a party of pleasure. This voyage on a raft over a pond annoys and wearies me."</p>
<p class="calibre8">He called this adventurous journey a party of pleasure, and this great inland sea a pond!</p>
<p class="calibre8">"But," argued I, "if we have followed the route indicated by the great Saknussemm, we cannot be going far wrong."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"'That is the question,' as the great, the immortal Shakespeare, has it. Are we following the route indicated by that wondrous sage? Did Saknussemm ever fall in with this great sheet of water? If he did, did he cross it? I begin to fear that the rivulet we adopted for a guide has led us wrong."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"In any case, we can never regret having come thus far. It is worth the whole journey to have enjoyed this magnificent spectacle—it is something to have seen."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"I care nothing about seeing, nor about magnificent spectacles. I came down into the interior of the earth with an object, and that object I mean to attain. Don't talk to me about admiring scenery, or any other sentimental trash."</p>
<p class="calibre8">After this I thought it well to hold my tongue, and allow the Professor to bite his lips until the blood came, without further remark.</p>
<p class="calibre8">At six o'clock in the evening, our matter-of-fact guide, Hans, asked for his week's salary, and receiving his three rix-dollars, put them carefully in his pocket. He was perfectly contented and satisfied.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Sunday, August 16th. Nothing new to record. The same weather as before. The wind has a slight tendency to freshen up, with signs of an approaching gale. When I awoke, my first observation was in regard to the intensity of the light. I keep on fearing, day after day, that the extraordinary electric phenomenon should become first obscured, and then go wholly out, leaving us in total darkness. Nothing, however, of the kind occurs. The shadow of the raft, its mast and sails, is clearly distinguished on the surface of the water.</p>
<p class="calibre8">This wondrous sea is, after all, infinite in its extent. It must be quite as wide as the Mediterranean—or perhaps even as the great Atlantic Ocean. Why, after all, should it not be so?</p>
<p class="calibre8">My uncle has on more than one occasion, tried deep-sea soundings. He tied the cross of one of our heaviest crowbars to the extremity of a cord, which he allowed to run out to the extent of two hundred fathoms. We had the greatest difficulty in hoisting in our novel kind of lead.</p>
<p class="calibre8">When the crowbar was finally dragged on board, Hans called my attention to some singular marks upon its surface. The piece of iron looked as if it had been crushed between two very hard substances.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I looked at our worthy guide with an inquiring glance.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Tander," said he.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Of course I was at a loss to understand. I turned round towards my uncle, absorbed in gloomy reflections. I had little wish to disturb him from his reverie. I accordingly turned once more towards our worthy Icelander.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Hans very quietly and significantly opened his mouth once or twice, as if in the act of biting, and in this way made me understand his meaning.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Teeth!" cried I, with stupefaction, as I examined the bar of iron with more attention.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Yes. There can be no doubt about the matter. The indentations on the bar of iron are the marks of teeth! What jaws must the owner of such molars be possessed of! Have we then, come upon a monster of unknown species, which still exists within the vast waste of waters—a monster more voracious than a shark, more terrible and bulky than the whale? I am unable to withdraw my eyes from the bar of iron, actually half crushed!</p>
<p class="calibre8">Is, then, my dream about to come true—a dread and terrible reality?</p>
<p class="calibre8">All day my thoughts were bent upon these speculations, and my imagination scarcely regained a degree of calmness and power of reflection until after a sleep of many hours.</p>
<p class="calibre8">This day, as on other Sundays, we observed as a day of rest and pious meditation.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Monday, August 17th. I have been trying to realize from memory the particular instincts of those antediluvian animals of the secondary period, which succeeding to the mollusca, to the crustacea, and to the fish, preceded the appearance of the race of mammifers. The generation of reptiles then reigned supreme upon the earth. These hideous monsters ruled everything in the seas of the secondary period, which formed the strata of which the Jura mountains are composed. Nature had endowed them with perfect organization. What a gigantic structure was theirs; what vast and prodigious strength they possessed!</p>
<p class="calibre8">The existing saurians, which include all such reptiles as lizards, crocodiles, and alligators, even the largest and most formidable of their class, are but feeble imitations of their mighty sires, the animals of ages long ago. If there were giants in the days of old, there were also gigantic animals.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I shuddered as I evolved from my mind the idea and recollection of these awful monsters. No eye of man had seen them in the flesh. They took their walks abroad upon the face of the earth thousands of ages before man came into existence, and their fossil bones, discovered in the limestone, have allowed us to reconstruct them anatomically, and thus to get some faint idea of their colossal formation.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I recollect once seeing in the great Museum of Hamburg the skeleton of one of these wonderful saurians. It measured no less than thirty feet from the nose to the tail. Am I, then, an inhabitant of the earth of the present day, destined to find myself face to face with a representative of this antediluvian family? I can scarcely believe it possible; I can hardly believe it true. And yet these marks of powerful teeth upon the bar of iron! Can there be a doubt from their shape that the bite is the bite of a crocodile?</p>
<p class="calibre8">My eyes stare wildly and with terror upon the subterranean sea. Every moment I expect one of these monsters to rise from its vast cavernous depths.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I fancy that the worthy Professor in some measure shares my notions, if not my fears, for, after an attentive examination of the crowbar, he cast his eyes rapidly over the mighty and mysterious ocean.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"What could possess him to leave the land," I thought, "as if the depth of this water was of any importance to us. No doubt he has disturbed some terrible monster in his watery home, and perhaps we may pay dearly for our temerity."</p>
<p class="calibre8">Anxious to be prepared for the worst, I examined our weapons, and saw that they were in a fit state for use. My uncle looked on at me and nodded his head approvingly. He, too, has noticed what we have to fear.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Already the uplifting of the waters on the surface indicates that something is in motion below. The danger approaches. It comes nearer and nearer. It behooves us to be on the watch.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Tuesday, August 18th. Evening came at last, the hour when the desire for sleep caused our eyelids to be heavy. Night there is not, properly speaking, in this place, any more than there is in summer in the arctic regions. Hans, however, is immovable at the rudder. When he snatches a moment of rest I really cannot say. I take advantage of his vigilance to take some little repose.</p>
<p class="calibre8">But two hours after I was awakened from a heavy sleep by an awful shock. The raft appeared to have struck upon a sunken rock. It was lifted right out of the water by some wondrous and mysterious power, and then started off twenty fathoms distant.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Eh, what is it?" cried my uncle starting up. "Are we shipwrecked, or what?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">Hans raised his hand and pointed to where, about two hundred yards off, a large black mass was moving up and down.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I looked with awe. My worst fears were realized.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"It is a colossal monster!" I cried, clasping my hands.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes," cried the agitated Professor, "and there yonder is a huge sea lizard of terrible size and shape."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"And farther on behold a prodigious crocodile. Look at his hideous jaws, and that row of monstrous teeth. Ha! he has gone."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"A whale! a whale!" shouted the Professor, "I can see her enormous fins. See, see, how she blows air and water!"</p>
<p class="calibre8">Two liquid columns rose to a vast height above the level of the sea, into which they fell with a terrific crash, waking up the echoes of that awful place. We stood still—surprised, stupefied, terror-stricken at the sight of this group of fearful marine monsters, more hideous in the reality than in my dream. They were of supernatural dimensions; the very smallest of the whole party could with ease have crushed our raft and ourselves with a single bite.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Hans, seizing the rudder which had flown out of his hand, puts it hard aweather in order to escape from such dangerous vicinity; but no sooner does he do so, than he finds he is flying from Scylla to Charybdis. To leeward is a turtle about forty feet wide, and a serpent quite as long, with an enormous and hideous head peering from out the waters.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Look which way we will, it is impossible for us to fly. The fearful reptiles advanced upon us; they turned and twisted about the raft with awful rapidity. They formed around our devoted vessel a series of concentric circles. I took up my rifle in desperation. But what effect can a rifle ball produce upon the armor scales with which the bodies of these horrid monsters are covered?</p>
<p class="calibre8">We remain still and dumb from utter horror. They advance upon us, nearer and nearer. Our fate appears certain, fearful and terrible. On one side the mighty crocodile, on the other the great sea serpent. The rest of the fearful crowd of marine prodigies have plunged beneath the briny waves and disappeared!</p>
<p class="calibre8">I am about to fire at any risk and try the effect of a shot. Hans, the guide, however, interfered by a sign to check me. The two hideous and ravenous monsters passed within fifty fathoms of the raft, and then made a rush at one another—their fury and rage preventing them from seeing us.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The combat commenced. We distinctly made out every action of the two hideous monsters.</p>
<p class="calibre8">But to my excited imagination the other animals appeared about to take part in the fierce and deadly struggle—the monster, the whale, the lizard, and the turtle. I distinctly saw them every moment. I pointed them out to the Icelander. But he only shook his head.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Tva," he said.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"What—two only does he say. Surely he is mistaken," I cried in a tone of wonder.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"He is quite right," replied my uncle coolly and philosophically, examining the terrible duel with his telescope and speaking as if he were in a lecture room.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"How can that be?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes, it is so. The first of these hideous monsters has the snout of a porpoise, the head of a lizard, the teeth of a crocodile; and it is this that has deceived us. It is the most fearful of all antediluvian reptiles, the world—renowned Ichthyosaurus or great fish lizard."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"And the other?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"The other is a monstrous serpent, concealed under the hard vaulted shell of the turtle, the terrible enemy of its fearful rival, the Plesiosaurus, or sea crocodile."</p>
<p class="calibre8">Hans was quite right. The two monsters only, disturbed the surface of the sea!</p>
<p class="calibre8">At last have mortal eyes gazed upon two reptiles of the great primitive ocean! I see the flaming red eyes of the Ichthyosaurus, each as big, or bigger than a man's head. Nature in its infinite wisdom had gifted this wondrous marine animal with an optical apparatus of extreme power, capable of resisting the pressure of the heavy layers of water which rolled over him in the depths of the ocean where he usually fed. It has by some authors truly been called the whale of the saurian race, for it is as big and quick in its motions as our king of the seas. This one measures not less than a hundred feet in length, and I can form some idea of his girth when I see him lift his prodigious tail out of the waters. His jaw is of awful size and strength, and according to the best-informed naturalists, it does not contain less than a hundred and eighty-two teeth.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The other was the mighty Plesiosaurus, a serpent with a cylindrical trunk, with a short stumpy tail, with fins like a bank of oars in a Roman galley.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Its whole body covered by a carapace or shell, and its neck, as flexible as that of a swan, rose more than thirty feet above the waves, a tower of animated flesh!</p>
<p class="calibre8">These animals attacked one another with inconceivable fury. Such a combat was never seen before by mortal eyes, and to us who did see it, it appeared more like the phantasmagoric creation of a dream than anything else. They raised mountains of water, which dashed in spray over the raft, already tossed to and fro by the waves. Twenty times we seemed on the point of being upset and hurled headlong into the waves. Hideous hisses appeared to shake the gloomy granite roof of that mighty cavern—hisses which carried terror to our hearts. The awful combatants held each other in a tight embrace. I could not make out one from the other. Still the combat could not last forever; and woe unto us, whichsoever became the victor.</p>
<p class="calibre8">One hour, two hours, three hours passed away, without any decisive result. The struggle continued with the same deadly tenacity, but without apparent result. The deadly opponents now approached, now drew away from the raft. Once or twice we fancied they were about to leave us altogether, but instead of that, they came nearer and nearer.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We crouched on the raft ready to fire at them at a moment's notice, poor as the prospect of hurting or terrifying them was. Still we were determined not to perish without a struggle.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Suddenly the Ichthyosaurus and the Plesiosaurus disappeared beneath the waves, leaving behind them a maelstrom in the midst of the sea. We were nearly drawn down by the indraft of the water!</p>
<p class="calibre8">Several minutes elapsed before anything was again seen. Was this wonderful combat to end in the depths of the ocean? Was the last act of this terrible drama to take place without spectators?</p>
<p class="calibre8">It was impossible for us to say.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Suddenly, at no great distance from us, an enormous mass rises out of the waters—the head of the great Plesiosaurus. The terrible monster is now wounded unto death. I can see nothing now of his enormous body. All that could be distinguished was his serpent-like neck, which he twisted and curled in all the agonies of death. Now he struck the waters with it as if it had been a gigantic whip, and then again wriggled like a worm cut in two. The water was spurted up to a great distance in all directions. A great portion of it swept over our raft and nearly blinded us. But soon the end of the beast approached nearer and nearer; his movements slackened visibly; his contortions almost ceased; and at last the body of the mighty snake lay an inert, dead mass on the surface of the now calm and placid waters.</p>
<p class="calibre8">As for the Ichthyosaurus, has he gone down to his mighty cavern under the sea to rest, or will he reappear to destroy us?</p>
<p class="calibre8">This question remained unanswered. And we had breathing time.</p>

<h4 id="pgepubid00063" class="calibre7">THE SEA MONSTER</h4>
<p class="calibre8">Wednesday, August 19th. Fortunately the wind, which for the present blows with some violence, has allowed us to escape from the scene of the unparalleled and extraordinary struggle. Hans with his usual imperturbable calm remained at the helm. My uncle, who for a short time had been withdrawn from his absorbing reveries by the novel incidents of this sea fight, fell back again apparently into a brown study. His eyes were fixed impatiently on the widespread ocean.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Our voyage now became monotonous and uniform. Dull as it has become, I have no desire to have it broken by any repetition of the perils and adventures of yesterday.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Thursday, August 20th. The wind is now N. N. E., and blows very irregularly. It has changed to fitful gusts. The temperature is exceedingly high. We are now progressing at the average rate of about ten miles and a half per hour.</p>
<p class="calibre8">About twelve o'clock a distant sound as of thunder fell upon our ears. I make a note of the fact without even venturing a suggestion as to its cause. It was one continued roar as of a sea falling over mighty rocks.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Far off in the distance," said the Professor dogmatically, "there is some rock or some island against which the sea lashed to fury by the wind, is breaking violently."</p>
<p class="calibre8">Hans, without saying a word, clambered to the top of the mast, but could make out nothing. The ocean was level in every direction as far as the eye could reach.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Three hours passed away without any sign to indicate what might be before us. The sound began to assume that of a mighty cataract.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I expressed my opinion on this point strongly to my uncle. He merely shook his head. I, however, am strongly impressed by a conviction that I am not wrong. Are we advancing towards some mighty waterfall which shall cast us into the abyss? Probably this mode of descending into the abyss may be agreeable to the Professor, because it would be something like the vertical descent he is so eager to make. I entertain a very different opinion.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Whatever be the truth, it is certain that not many leagues distant there must be some very extraordinary phenomenon, for as we advance the roar becomes something mighty and stupendous. Is it in the water, or in the air?</p>
<p class="calibre8">I cast hasty glances aloft at the suspended vapors, and I seek to penetrate their mighty depths. But the vault above is tranquil. The clouds, which are now elevated to the very summit, appear utterly still and motionless, and completely lost in the irradiation of electric light. It is necessary, therefore, to seek for the cause of this phenomenon elsewhere.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I examine the horizon, now perfectly calm, pure, and free from all haze. Its aspect still remains unchanged. But if this awful noise proceeds from a cataract—if, so to speak in plain English, this vast interior ocean is precipitated into a lower basin—if these tremendous roars are produced by the noise of falling waters, the current would increase in activity, and its increasing swiftness would give me some idea of the extent of the peril with which we are menaced. I consult the current. It simply does not exist: there is no such thing. An empty bottle cast into the water lies to leeward without motion.</p>
<p class="calibre8">About four o'clock Hans rises, clambers up the mast, and reaches the truck itself. From this elevated position his looks are cast around. They take in a vast circumference of the ocean. At last, his eyes remain fixed. His face expresses no astonishment, but his eyes slightly dilate.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"He has seen something at last," cried my uncle.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"I think so," I replied.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Hans came down, stood beside us, and pointed with his right hand to the south.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Der nere," he said.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"There," replied my uncle.</p>
<p class="calibre8">And seizing his telescope, he looked at it with great attention for about a minute, which to me appeared an age. I knew not what to think or expect.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes, yes," he cried in a tone of considerable surprise, "there it is."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"What?" I asked.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"A tremendous spurt of water rising out of the waves."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Some other marine monster," I cried, already alarmed.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Perhaps."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Then let us steer more to the westward, for we know what we have to expect from antediluvian animals," was my eager reply.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Go ahead," said my uncle.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I turned towards Hans. Hans was at the tiller steering with his usual imperturbable calm.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Nevertheless, if from the distance which separated us from this creature, a distance which must be estimated at not less than a dozen leagues, one could see the column of water spurting from the blow-hole of the great animal, his dimensions must be something preternatural. To fly is, therefore, the course to be suggested by ordinary prudence. But we have not come into that part of the world to be prudent. Such is my uncle's determination.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We, accordingly, continued to advance. The nearer we come, the loftier is the spouting water. What monster can fill himself with such huge volumes of water, and then unceasingly spout them out in such lofty jets?</p>
<p class="calibre8">At eight o'clock in the evening, reckoning as above ground, where there is day and night, we are not more than two leagues from the mighty beast. Its long, black, enormous, mountainous body, lies on the top of the water like an island. But then sailors have been said to have gone ashore on sleeping whales, mistaking them for land. Is it illusion, or is it fear? Its length cannot be less than a thousand fathoms. What, then, is this cetaceous monster of which no Cuvier ever thought?</p>
<p class="calibre8">It is quite motionless and presents the appearance of sleep. The sea seems unable to lift him upwards; it is rather the waves which break on his huge and gigantic frame. The waterspout, rising to a height of five hundred feet, breaks in spray with a dull, sullen roar.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We advance, like senseless lunatics, towards this mighty mass.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I honestly confess that I was abjectly afraid. I declared that I would go no farther. I threatened in my terror to cut the sheet of the sail. I attacked the Professor with considerable acrimony, calling him foolhardy, mad, I know not what. He made no answer.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Suddenly the imperturbable Hans once more pointed his finger to the menacing object:</p>
<p class="calibre8">"<i class="calibre5">Holme</i>!"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"An island!" cried my uncle.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"An island?" I replied, shrugging my shoulders at this poor attempt at deception.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Of course it is," cried my uncle, bursting into a loud and joyous laugh.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"But the waterspout?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Geyser," said Hans.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes, of course—a geyser," replied my uncle, still laughing, "a geyser like those common in Iceland. Jets like this are the great wonders of the country."</p>
<p class="calibre8">At first I would not allow that I had been so grossly deceived. What could be more ridiculous than to have taken an island for a marine monster? But kick as one may, one must yield to evidence, and I was finally convinced of my error. It was nothing, after all, but a natural phenomenon.</p>
<p class="calibre8">As we approached nearer and nearer, the dimensions of the liquid sheaf of waters became truly grand and stupendous. The island had, at a distance, presented the appearance of an enormous whale, whose head rose high above the waters. The geyser, a word the Icelanders pronounce geysir, and which signifies fury, rose majestically from its summit. Dull detonations are heard every now and then, and the enormous jet, taken as it were with sudden fury, shakes its plume of vapor, and bounds into the first layer of the clouds. It is alone. Neither spurts of vapor nor hot springs surround it, and the whole volcanic power of that region is concentrated in one sublime column. The rays of electric light mix with this dazzling sheaf, every drop as it falls assuming the prismatic colors of the rainbow.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Let us go on shore," said the Professor, after some minutes of silence.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It is necessary, however, to take great precaution, in order to avoid the weight of falling waters, which would cause the raft to founder in an instant. Hans, however, steers admirably, and brings us to the other extremity of the island.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I was the first to leap on the rock. My uncle followed, while the eider-duck hunter remained still, like a man above any childish sources of astonishment. We were now walking on granite mixed with siliceous sandstone; the soil shivered under our feet like the sides of boilers in which over-heated steam is forcibly confined. It is burning. We soon came in sight of the little central basin from which rose the geyser. I plunged a thermometer into the water which ran bubbling from the centre, and it marked a heat of a hundred and sixty-three degrees!</p>
<p class="calibre8">This water, therefore, came from some place where the heat was intense. This was singularly in contradiction with the theories of Professor Hardwigg. I could not help telling him my opinion on the subject.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well," said he sharply, "and what does this prove against my doctrine?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Nothing," replied I dryly, seeing that I was running my head against a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Nevertheless, I am compelled to confess that until now we have been most remarkably fortunate, and that this voyage is being accomplished in most favorable conditions of temperature; but it appears evident, in fact, certain, that we shall sooner or later arrive at one of those regions where the central heat will reach its utmost limits, and will go far beyond all the possible gradations of thermometers.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Visions of the Hades of the ancients, believed to be in the centre of the earth, floated through my imagination.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We shall, however, see what we shall see. That is the Professor's favorite phrase now. Having christened the volcanic island by the name of his nephew, the leader of the expedition turned away and gave the signal for embarkation.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I stood still, however, for some minutes, gazing upon the magnificent geyser. I soon was able to perceive that the upward tendency of the water was irregular; now it diminished in intensity, and then, suddenly, it regained new vigor, which I attributed to the variation of the pressure of the accumulated vapors in its reservoir.</p>
<p class="calibre8">At last we took our departure, going carefully round the projecting, and rather dangerous, rocks of the southern side. Hans had taken advantage of this brief halt to repair the raft.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Before we took our final departure from the island, however, I made some observations to calculate the distance we had gone over, and I put them down in my journal. Since we left Port Gretchen, we had traveled two hundred and seventy leagues—more than eight hundred miles—on this great inland sea; we were, therefore, six hundred and twenty leagues from Iceland, and exactly under England.</p>

<h4 id="pgepubid00065" class="calibre7">THE BATTLE OF THE ELEMENTS</h4>
<p class="calibre8">Friday, August 21st. This morning the magnificent geyser had wholly disappeared. The wind had freshened up, and we were fast leaving the neighborhood of Henry's Island. Even the roaring sound of the mighty column was lost to the ear.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The weather, if, under the circumstances, we may use such an expression, is about to change very suddenly. The atmosphere is being gradually loaded with vapors, which carry with them the electricity formed by the constant evaporation of the saline waters; the clouds are slowly but sensibly falling towards the sea, and are assuming a dark-olive texture; the electric rays can scarcely pierce through the opaque curtain which has fallen like a drop scene before this wondrous theater, on the stage of which another and terrible drama is soon to be enacted. This time it is no fight of animals; it is the fearful battle of the elements.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I feel that I am very peculiarly influenced, as all creatures are on land when a deluge is about to take place.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The cumuli, a perfectly oval kind of cloud, piled upon the south, presented a most awful and sinister appearance, with the pitiless aspect often seen before a storm. The air is extremely heavy; the sea is comparatively calm.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In the distance, the clouds have assumed the appearance of enormous balls of cotton, or rather pods, piled one above the other in picturesque confusion. By degrees, they appear to swell out, break, and gain in number what they lose in grandeur; their heaviness is so great that they are unable to lift themselves from the horizon; but under the influence of the upper currents of air, they are gradually broken up, become much darker, and then present the appearance of one single layer of a formidable character; now and then a lighter cloud, still lit up from above, rebounds upon this grey carpet, and is lost in the opaque mass.</p>
<p class="calibre8">There can be no doubt that the entire atmosphere is saturated with electric fluid; I am myself wholly impregnated; my hairs literally stand on end as if under the influence of a galvanic battery. If one of my companions ventured to touch me, I think he would receive rather a violent and unpleasant shock.</p>
<p class="calibre8">About ten o'clock in the morning, the symptoms of the storm became more thorough and decisive; the wind appeared to soften down as if to take breath for a renewed attack; the vast funereal pall above us looked like a huge bag—like the cave of AEolus, in which the storm was collecting its forces for the attack.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I tried all I could not to believe in the menacing signs of the sky, and yet I could not avoid saying, as it were involuntarily:</p>
<p class="calibre8">"I believe we are going to have bad weather."</p>
<p class="calibre8">The Professor made me no answer. He was in a horrible, in a detestable humor—to see the ocean stretching interminably before his eyes. On hearing my words he simply shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"We shall have a tremendous storm," I said again, pointing to the horizon. "These clouds are falling lower and lower upon the sea, as if to crush it."</p>
<p class="calibre8">A great silence prevailed. The wind wholly ceased. Nature assumed a dead calm, and ceased to breathe. Upon the mast, where I noticed a sort of slight ignis fatuus, the sail hangs in loose heavy folds. The raft is motionless in the midst of a dark heavy sea—without undulation, without motion. It is as still as glass. But as we are making no progress, what is the use of keeping up the sail, which may be the cause of our perdition if the tempest should suddenly strike us without warning.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Let us lower the sail," I said, "it is only an act of common prudence."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"No—no," cried my uncle, in an exasperated tone, "a hundred times, no. Let the wind strike us and do its worst, let the storm sweep us away where it will—only let me see the glimmer of some coast—of some rocky cliffs, even if they dash our raft into a thousand pieces. No! keep up the sail—no matter what happens."</p>
<p class="calibre8">These words were scarcely uttered when the southern horizon underwent a sudden and violent change. The long accumulated vapors were resolved into water, and the air required to fill up the void produced became a wild and raging tempest.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It came from the most distant corners of the mighty cavern. It raged from every point of the compass. It roared; it yelled; it shrieked with glee as of demons let loose. The darkness increased and became indeed darkness visible.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The raft rose and fell with the storm, and bounded over the waves. My uncle was cast headlong upon the deck. I with great difficulty dragged myself towards him. He was holding on with might and main to the end of a cable, and appeared to gaze with pleasure and delight at the spectacle of the unchained elements.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Hans never moved a muscle. His long hair driven hither and thither by the tempest and scattered wildly over his motionless face, gave him a most extraordinary appearance—for every single hair was illuminated by little sparkling sprigs.</p>
<p class="calibre8">His countenance presents the extraordinary appearance of an antediluvian man, a true contemporary of the Megatherium.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Still the mast holds good against the storm. The sail spreads out and fills like a soap bubble about to burst. The raft rushes on at a pace impossible to estimate, but still less swiftly than the body of water displaced beneath it, the rapidity of which may be seen by the lines which fly right and left in the wake.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"The sail, the sail!" I cried, making a trumpet of my hands, and then endeavoring to lower it.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Let it alone!" said my uncle, more exasperated than ever.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"<i class="calibre5">Nej</i>," said Hans, gently shaking his head.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Nevertheless, the rain formed a roaring cataract before this horizon of which we were in search, and to which we were rushing like madmen.</p>
<p class="calibre8">But before this wilderness of waters reached us, the mighty veil of cloud was torn in twain; the sea began to foam wildly; and the electricity, produced by some vast and extraordinary chemical action in the upper layer of cloud, is brought into play. To the fearful claps of thunder are added dazzling flashes of lightning, such as I had never seen. The flashes crossed one another, hurled from every side; while the thunder came pealing like an echo. The mass of vapor becomes incandescent; the hailstones which strike the metal of our boots and our weapons are actually luminous; the waves as they rise appear to be fire-eating monsters, beneath which seethes an intense fire, their crests surmounted by combs of flame.</p>
<p class="calibre8">My eyes are dazzled, blinded by the intensity of light, my ears are deafened by the awful roar of the elements. I am compelled to hold onto the mast, which bends like a reed beneath the violence of the storm, to which none ever before seen by mariners bore any resemblance.</p>
<hr class="c4"/>
<p class="calibre8">Here my traveling notes become very incomplete, loose and vague. I have only been able to make out one or two fugitive observations, jotted down in a mere mechanical way. But even their brevity, even their obscurity, show the emotions which overcame me.</p>
<hr class="c4"/>
<p class="calibre8">Sunday, August 23rd. Where have we got to? In what region are we wandering? We are still carried forward with inconceivable rapidity.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The night has been fearful, something not to be described. The storm shows no signs of cessation. We exist in the midst of an uproar which has no name. The detonations as of artillery are incessant. Our ears literally bleed. We are unable to exchange a word, or hear each other speak.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The lightning never ceases to flash for a single instant. I can see the zigzags after a rapid dart strike the arched roof of this mightiest of mighty vaults. If it were to give way and fall upon us! Other lightnings plunge their forked streaks in every direction, and take the form of globes of fire, which explode like bombshells over a beleaguered city. The general crash and roar do not apparently increase; it has already gone far beyond what human ear can appreciate. If all the powder magazines in the world were to explode together, it would be impossible for us to hear worse noise.</p>
<p class="calibre8">There is a constant emission of light from the storm clouds; the electric matter is incessantly released; evidently the gaseous principles of the air are out of order; innumerable columns of water rush up like waterspouts, and fall back upon the surface of the ocean in foam.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Whither are we going? My uncle still lies at full length upon the raft, without speaking—without taking any note of time.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The heat increases. I look at the thermometer, to my surprise it indicates—<i class="calibre5">The exact figure is here rubbed out in my manuscript.</i></p>
<p class="calibre8">Monday, August 24th. This terrible storm will never end. Why should not this state of the atmosphere, so dense and murky, once modified, again remain definitive?</p>
<p class="calibre8">We are utterly broken and harassed by fatigue. Hans remains just as usual. The raft runs to the southeast invariably. We have now already run two hundred leagues from the newly discovered island.</p>
<p class="calibre8">About twelve o'clock the storm became worse than ever. We are obliged now to fasten every bit of cargo tightly on the deck of the raft, or everything would be swept away. We make ourselves fast, too, each man lashing the other. The waves drive over us, so that several times we are actually under water.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We had been under the painful necessity of abstaining from speech for three days and three nights. We opened our mouths, we moved our lips, but no sound came. Even when we placed our mouths to each other's ears it was the same.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The wind carried the voice away.</p>
<p class="calibre8">My uncle once contrived to get his head close to mine after several almost vain endeavors. He appeared to my nearly exhausted senses to articulate some word. I had a notion, more from intuition than anything else, that he said to me, "We are lost."</p>
<p class="calibre8">I took out my notebook, from which under the most desperate circumstances I never parted, and wrote a few words as legibly as I could:</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Take in sail."</p>
<p class="calibre8">With a deep sigh he nodded his head and acquiesced.</p>
<p class="calibre8">His head had scarcely time to fall back in the position from which he had momentarily raised it than a disk or ball of fire appeared on the very edge of the raft—our devoted, our doomed craft. The mast and sail are carried away bodily, and I see them swept away to a prodigious height like a kite.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We were frozen, actually shivered with terror. The ball of fire, half white, half azure-colored, about the size of a ten-inch bombshell, moved along, turning with prodigious rapidity to leeward of the storm. It ran about here, there, and everywhere, it clambered up one of the bulwarks of the raft, it leaped upon the sack of provisions, and then finally descended lightly, fell like a football and landed on our powder barrel.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Horrible situation. An explosion of course was now inevitable.</p>
<p class="calibre8">By heaven's mercy, it was not so.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The dazzling disk moved on one side, it approached Hans, who looked at it with singular fixity; then it approached my uncle, who cast himself on his knees to avoid it; it came towards me, as I stood pale and shuddering in the dazzling light and heat; it pirouetted round my feet, which I endeavored to withdraw.</p>
<p class="calibre8">An odor of nitrous gas filled the whole air; it penetrated to the throat, to the lungs. I felt ready to choke.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Why is it that I cannot withdraw my feet? Are they riveted to the flooring of the raft?</p>
<p class="calibre8">No.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The fall of the electric globe has turned all the iron on board into loadstones—the instruments, the tools, the arms are clanging together with awful and horrible noise; the nails of my heavy boots adhere closely to the plate of iron incrustated in the wood. I cannot withdraw my foot.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It is the old story again of the mountain of adamant.</p>
<p class="calibre8">At last, by a violent and almost superhuman effort, I tear it away just as the ball which is still executing its gyratory motions is about to run round it and drag me with it—if—</p>
<p class="calibre8">Oh, what intense stupendous light! The globe of fire bursts—we are enveloped in cascades of living fire, which flood the space around with luminous matter.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Then all went out and darkness once more fell upon the deep! I had just time to see my uncle once more cast apparently senseless on the flooring of the raft, Hans at the helm, "spitting fire" under the influence of the electricity which seemed to have gone through him.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Whither are we going, I ask? and echo answers, Whither?</p>
<p class="calibre8">.............</p>
<p class="calibre8">Tuesday, August 25th. I have just come out of a long fainting fit. The awful and hideous storm still continues; the lightning has increased in vividness, and pours out its fiery wrath like a brood of serpents let loose in the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Are we still upon the sea? Yes, and being carried along with incredible velocity.</p>
<p class="calibre8">We have passed under England, under the Channel, under France, probably under the whole extent of Europe.</p>
<hr class="c4"/>
<p class="calibre8">Another awful clamor in the distance. This time it is certain that the sea is breaking upon the rocks at no great distance. Then—</p>
