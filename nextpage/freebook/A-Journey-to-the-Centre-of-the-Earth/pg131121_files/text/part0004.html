<h4 id="pgepubid00051" class="calibre7">THE WHISPERING GALLERY</h4>
<p class="calibre8">When at last I came back to a sense of life and being, my face was wet, but wet, as I soon knew, with tears. How long this state of insensibility lasted, it is quite impossible for me now to say. I had no means left to me of taking any account of time. Never since the creation of the world had such a solitude as mine existed. I was completely abandoned.</p>
<p class="calibre8">After my fall I lost much blood. I felt myself flooded with the life-giving liquid. My first sensation was perhaps a natural one. Why was I not dead? Because I was alive, there was something left to do. I tried to make up my mind to think no longer. As far as I was able, I drove away all ideas, and utterly overcome by pain and grief, I crouched against the granite wall.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I just commenced to feel the fainting coming on again, and the sensation that this was the last struggle before complete annihilation—when, on a sudden, a violent uproar reached my ears. It had some resemblance to the prolonged rumbling voice of thunder, and I clearly distinguished sonorous voices, lost one after the other, in the distant depths of the gulf.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Whence came this noise? Naturally, it was to be supposed from new phenomena which were taking place in the bosom of the solid mass of Mother Earth! The explosion of some gaseous vapors, or the fall of some solid, of the granitic or other rock.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Again I listened with deep attention. I was extremely anxious to hear if this strange and inexplicable sound was likely to be renewed! A whole quarter of an hour elapsed in painful expectation. Deep and solemn silence reigned in the tunnel. So still that I could hear the beatings of my own heart! I waited, waited with a strange kind of hopefulness.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Suddenly my ear, which leaned accidentally against the wall, appeared to catch, as it were, the faintest echo of a sound. I thought that I heard vague, incoherent and distant voices. I quivered all over with excitement and hope!</p>
<p class="calibre8">"It must be hallucination," I cried. "It cannot be! it is not true!"</p>
<p class="calibre8">But no! By listening more attentively, I really did convince myself that what I heard was truly the sound of human voices. To make any meaning out of the sound, however, was beyond my power. I was too weak even to hear distinctly. Still it was a positive fact that someone was speaking. Of that I was quite certain.</p>
<p class="calibre8">There was a moment of fear. A dread fell upon my soul that it might be my own words brought back to me by a distant echo. Perhaps without knowing it, I might have been crying aloud. I resolutely closed my lips, and once more placed my ear to the huge granite wall.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Yes, for certain. It was in truth the sound of human voices.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I now by the exercise of great determination dragged myself along the sides of the cavern, until I reached a point where I could hear more distinctly. But though I could detect the sound, I could only make out uncertain, strange, and incomprehensible words. They reached my ear as if they had been spoken in a low tone—murmured, as it were, afar off.</p>
<p class="calibre8">At last, I made out the word forlorad repeated several times in a tone betokening great mental anguish and sorrow.</p>
<p class="calibre8">What could this word mean, and who was speaking it? It must be either my uncle or the guide Hans! If, therefore, I could hear them, they must surely be able to hear me.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Help," I cried at the top of my voice; "help, I am dying!"</p>
<p class="calibre8">I then listened with scarcely a breath; I panted for the slightest sound in the darkness—a cry, a sigh, a question! But silence reigned supreme. No answer came! In this way some minutes passed. A whole flood of ideas flashed through my mind. I began to fear that my voice, weakened by sickness and suffering, could not reach my companions who were in search of me.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"It must be they," I cried; "who else could by any possibility be buried a hundred miles below the level of the earth?" The mere supposition was preposterous.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I began, therefore, to listen again with the most breathless attention. As I moved my ears along the side of the place I was in, I found a mathematical point as it were, where the voices appeared to attain their maximum of intensity. The word forlorad again distinctly reached my ear. Then came again that rolling noise like thunder which had awakened me out of torpor.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"I begin to understand," I said to myself after some little time devoted to reflection; "it is not through the solid mass that the sound reaches my ears. The walls of my cavernous retreat are of solid granite, and the most fearful explosion would not make uproar enough to penetrate them. The sound must come along the gallery itself. The place I was in must possess some peculiar acoustic properties of its own."</p>
<p class="calibre8">Again I listened; and this time—yes, this time—I heard my name distinctly pronounced: cast as it were into space.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It was my uncle, the Professor, who was speaking. He was in conversation with the guide, and the word which had so often reached my ears, forlorad, was a Danish expression.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Then I understood it all. In order to make myself heard, I too must speak as it were along the side of the gallery, which would carry the sound of my voice just as the wire carries the electric fluid from point to point.</p>
<p class="calibre8">But there was no time to lose. If my companions were only to remove a few feet from where they stood, the acoustic effect would be over, my Whispering Gallery would be destroyed. I again therefore crawled towards the wall, and said as clearly and distinctly as I could:</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Uncle Hardwigg."</p>
<p class="calibre8">I then awaited a reply.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Sound does not possess the property of traveling with such extreme rapidity. Besides the density of the air at that depth from light and motion was very far from adding to the rapidity of circulation. Several seconds elapsed, which to my excited imagination, appeared ages; and these words reached my eager ears, and moved my wildly beating heart:</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Harry, my boy, is that you?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">A short delay between question and answer.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes—yes."</p>
<p class="calibre8">..........</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Where are you?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">..........</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Lost!"</p>
<p class="calibre8">..........</p>
<p class="calibre8">"And your lamp?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">..........</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Out."</p>
<p class="calibre8">..........</p>
<p class="calibre8">"But the guiding stream?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">..........</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Is lost!"</p>
<p class="calibre8">..........</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Keep your courage, Harry. We will do our best."</p>
<p class="calibre8">..........</p>
<p class="calibre8">"One moment, my uncle," I cried; "I have no longer strength to answer your questions. But—for heaven's sake—do you—continue—to speak—to me!" Absolute silence, I felt, would be annihilation.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Keep up your courage," said my uncle. "As you are so weak, do not speak. We have been searching for you in all directions, both by going upwards and downwards in the gallery. My dear boy, I had begun to give over all hope—and you can never know what bitter tears of sorrow and regret I have shed. At last, supposing you to be still on the road beside the Hansbach, we again descended, firing off guns as signals. Now, however, that we have found you, and that our voices reach each other, it may be a long time before we actually meet. We are conversing by means of some extraordinary acoustic arrangement of the labyrinth. But do not despair, my dear boy. It is something gained even to hear each other."</p>
<p class="calibre8">While he was speaking, my brain was at work reflecting. A certain undefined hope, vague and shapeless as yet, made my heart beat wildly. In the first place, it was absolutely necessary for me to know one thing. I once more, therefore, leaned my head against the wall, which I almost touched with my lips, and again spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Uncle."</p>
<p class="calibre8">..........</p>
<p class="calibre8">"My boy?" was his answer after a few moments.</p>
<p class="calibre8">..........</p>
<p class="calibre8">"It is of the utmost consequence that we should know how far we are asunder."</p>
<p class="calibre8">..........</p>
<p class="calibre8">"That is not difficult."</p>
<p class="calibre8">..........</p>
<p class="calibre8">"You have your chronometer at hand?" I asked.</p>
<p class="calibre8">..........</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Certainly."</p>
<p class="calibre8">..........</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, take it into your hand. Pronounce my name, noting exactly the second at which you speak. I will reply as soon as I hear your words—and you will then note exactly the moment at which my reply reaches you."</p>
<p class="calibre8">..........</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Very good; and the mean time between my question and your answer will be the time occupied by my voice in reaching you."</p>
<p class="calibre8">..........</p>
<p class="calibre8">"That is exactly what I mean, Uncle," was my eager reply.</p>
<p class="calibre8">..........</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Are you ready?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">..........</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes."</p>
<p class="calibre8">..........</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, make ready, I am about to pronounce your name," said the Professor.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I applied my ear close to the sides of the cavernous gallery, and as soon as the word "Harry" reached my ear, I turned round and, placing my lips to the wall, repeated the sound.</p>
<p class="calibre8">..........</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Forty seconds," said my uncle. "There has elapsed forty seconds between the two words. The sound, therefore, takes twenty seconds to ascend. Now, allowing a thousand and twenty feet for every second—we have twenty thousand four hundred feet—a league and a half and one-eighth."</p>
<p class="calibre8">These words fell on my soul like a kind of death knell.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"A league and a half," I muttered in a low and despairing voice.</p>
<p class="calibre8">..........</p>
<p class="calibre8">"It shall be got over, my boy," cried my uncle in a cheery tone; "depend on us."</p>
<p class="calibre8">..........</p>
<p class="calibre8">"But do you know whether to ascend or descend?" I asked faintly enough.</p>
<p class="calibre8">..........</p>
<p class="calibre8">"We have to descend, and I will tell you why. You have reached a vast open space, a kind of bare crossroad, from which galleries diverge in every direction. That in which you are now lying must necessarily bring you to this point, for it appears that all these mighty fissures, these fractures of the globe's interior, radiate from the vast cavern which we at this moment occupy. Rouse yourself, then, have courage and continue your route. Walk if you can, if not drag yourself along—slide, if nothing else is possible. The slope must be rather rapid—and you will find strong arms to receive you at the end of your journey. Make a start, like a good fellow."</p>
<p class="calibre8">These words served to rouse some kind of courage in my sinking frame.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Farewell for the present, good uncle, I am about to take my departure. As soon as I start, our voices will cease to commingle. Farewell, then, until we meet again."</p>
<p class="calibre8">..........</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Adieu, Harry—until we say Welcome." Such were the last words which reached my anxious ears before I commenced my weary and almost hopeless journey.</p>
<p class="calibre8">This wonderful and surprising conversation which took place through the vast mass of the earth's labyrinth, these words exchanged, the speakers being about five miles apart—ended with hopeful and pleasant expressions. I breathed one more prayer to Heaven, I sent up words of thanksgiving—believing in my inmost heart that He had led me to the only place where the voices of my friends could reach my ears.</p>
<p class="calibre8">This apparently astounding acoustic mystery is easily explainable by simple natural laws; it arose from the conductibility of the rock. There are many instances of this singular propagation of sound which are not perceptible in its less mediate positions. In the interior gallery of St. Paul's, and amid the curious caverns in Sicily, these phenomena are observable. The most marvelous of them all is known as the Ear of Dionysius.</p>
<p class="calibre8">These memories of the past, of my early reading and studies, came fresh to my thoughts. Moreover, I began to reason that if my uncle and I could communicate at so great a distance, no serious obstacle could exist between us. All I had to do was to follow the direction whence the sound had reached me; and logically putting it, I must reach him if my strength did not fail.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I accordingly rose to my feet. I soon found, however, that I could not walk; that I must drag myself along. The slope as I expected was very rapid; but I allowed myself to slip down.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Soon the rapidity of the descent began to assume frightful proportions; and menaced a fearful fall. I clutched at the sides; I grasped at projections of rocks; I threw myself backwards. All in vain. My weakness was so great I could do nothing to save myself.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Suddenly earth failed me.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I was first launched into a dark and gloomy void. I then struck against the projecting asperities of a vertical gallery, a perfect well. My head bounded against a pointed rock, and I lost all knowledge of existence. As far as I was concerned, death had claimed me for his own.</p>

<h4 id="pgepubid00053" class="calibre7">A RAPID RECOVERY</h4>
<p class="calibre8">When I returned to the consciousness of existence, I found myself surrounded by a kind of semiobscurity, lying on some thick and soft coverlets. My uncle was watching—his eyes fixed intently on my countenance, a grave expression on his face, a tear in his eye. At the first sigh which struggled from my bosom, he took hold of my hand. When he saw my eyes open and fix themselves upon his, he uttered a loud cry of joy. "He lives! he lives!"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes, my good uncle," I whispered.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"My dear boy," continued the grim Professor, clasping me to his heart, "you are saved!"</p>
<p class="calibre8">I was deeply and unaffectedly touched by the tone in which these words were uttered, and even more by the kindly care which accompanied them. The Professor, however, was one of those men who must be severely tried in order to induce any display of affection or gentle emotion. At this moment our friend Hans, the guide, joined us. He saw my hand in that of my uncle, and I venture to say that, taciturn as he was, his eyes beamed with lively satisfaction.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"God dag," he said.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Good day, Hans, good day," I replied, in as hearty a tone as I could assume, "and now, Uncle, that we are together, tell me where we are. I have lost all idea of our position, as of everything else."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Tomorrow, Harry, tomorrow," he replied. "Today you are far too weak. Your head is surrounded with bandages and poultices that must not be touched. Sleep, my boy, sleep, and tomorrow you will know all that you require."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"But," I cried, "let me know what o'clock it is—what day it is?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"It is now eleven o'clock at night, and this is once more Sunday. It is now the ninth of the month of August. And I distinctly prohibit you from asking any more questions until the tenth of the same."</p>
<p class="calibre8">I was, if the truth were told, very weak indeed, and my eyes soon closed involuntarily. I did require a good night's rest, and I went off reflecting at the last moment that my perilous adventure in the interior of the earth, in total darkness, had lasted four days!</p>
<p class="calibre8">On the morning of the next day, at my awakening, I began to look around me. My sleeping place, made of all our traveling bedding, was in a charming grotto, adorned with magnificent stalagmites, glittering in all the colors of the rainbow, the floor of soft and silvery sand.</p>
<p class="calibre8">A dim obscurity prevailed. No torch, no lamp was lighted, and yet certain unexplained beams of light penetrated from without, and made their way through the opening of the beautiful grotto.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I, moreover, heard a vague and indefinite murmur, like the ebb and flow of waves upon a strand, and sometimes I verily believed I could hear the sighing of the wind.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I began to believe that, instead of being awake, I must be dreaming. Surely my brain had not been affected by my fall, and all that occurred during the last twenty-four hours was not the frenzied visions of madness? And yet after some reflection, a trial of my faculties, I came to the conclusion that I could not be mistaken. Eyes and ears could not surely both deceive me.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"It is a ray of the blessed daylight," I said to myself, "which has penetrated through some mighty fissure in the rocks. But what is the meaning of this murmur of waves, this unmistakable moaning of the salt-sea billows? I can hear, too, plainly enough, the whistling of the wind. But can I be altogether mistaken? If my uncle, during my illness, has but carried me back to the surface of the earth! Has he, on my account, given up his wondrous expedition, or in some strange manner has it come to an end?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">I was puzzling my brain over these and other questions, when the Professor joined me.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Good day, Harry," he cried in a joyous tone. "I fancy you are quite well."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"I am very much better," I replied, actually sitting up in my bed.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"I knew that would be the end of it, as you slept both soundly and tranquilly. Hans and I have each taken turn to watch, and every hour we have seen visible signs of amelioration."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"You must be right, Uncle," was my reply, "for I feel as if I could do justice to any meal you could put before me."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"You shall eat, my boy, you shall eat. The fever has left you. Our excellent friend Hans has rubbed your wounds and bruises with I know not what ointment, of which the Icelanders alone possess the secret. And they have healed your bruises in the most marvelous manner. Ah, he's a wise fellow is Master Hans."</p>
<p class="calibre8">While he was speaking, my uncle was placing before me several articles of food, which, despite his earnest injunctions, I readily devoured. As soon as the first rage of hunger was appeased, I overwhelmed him with questions, to which he now no longer hesitated to give answers.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I then learned, for the first time, that my providential fall had brought me to the bottom of an almost perpendicular gallery. As I came down, amidst a perfect shower of stones, the least of which falling on me would have crushed me to death, they came to the conclusion that I had carried with me an entire dislocated rock. Riding as it were on this terrible chariot, I was cast headlong into my uncle's arms. And into them I fell, insensible and covered with blood.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"It is indeed a miracle," was the Professor's final remark, "that you were not killed a thousand times over. But let us take care never to separate; for surely we should risk never meeting again."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Let us take care never again to separate."</p>
<p class="calibre8">These words fell with a sort of chill upon my heart. The journey, then, was not over. I looked at my uncle with surprise and astonishment. My uncle, after an instant's examination of my countenance, said: "What is the matter, Harry?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"I want to ask you a very serious question. You say that I am all right in health?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Certainly you are."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"And all my limbs are sound and capable of new exertion?" I asked.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Most undoubtedly."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"But what about my head?" was my next anxious question.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, your head, except that you have one or two contusions, is exactly where it ought to be—on your shoulders," said my uncle, laughing.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, my own opinion is that my head is not exactly right. In fact, I believe myself slightly delirious."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"What makes you think so?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"I will explain why I fancy I have lost my senses," I cried. "Have we not returned to the surface of Mother Earth?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Certainly not."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Then truly I must be mad, for do I not see the light of day? do I not hear the whistling of the wind? and can I not distinguish the wash of a great sea?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"And that is all that makes you uneasy?" said my uncle, with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Can you explain?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"I will not make any attempt to explain; for the whole matter is utterly inexplicable. But you shall see and judge for yourself. You will then find that geological science is as yet in its infancy—and that we are doomed to enlighten the world."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Let us advance, then," I cried eagerly, no longer able to restrain my curiosity.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Wait a moment, my dear Harry," he responded; "you must take precautions after your illness before going into the open air."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"The open air?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes, my boy. I have to warn you that the wind is rather violent—and I have no wish for you to expose yourself without necessary precautions."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"But I beg to assure you that I am perfectly recovered from my illness."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Have just a little patience, my boy. A relapse would be inconvenient to all parties. We have no time to lose—as our approaching sea voyage may be of long duration."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Sea voyage?" I cried, more bewildered than ever.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes. You must take another day's rest, and we shall be ready to go on board by tomorrow," replied my uncle, with a peculiar smile.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Go on board!" The words utterly astonished me.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Go on board—what and how? Had we come upon a river, a lake, had we discovered some inland sea? Was a vessel lying at anchor in some part of the interior of the earth?</p>
<p class="calibre8">My curiosity was worked up to the very highest pitch. My uncle made vain attempts to restrain me. When at last, however, he discovered that my feverish impatience would do more harm than good—and that the satisfaction of my wishes could alone restore me to a calm state of mind—he gave way.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I dressed myself rapidly—and then taking the precaution to please my uncle, of wrapping myself in one of the coverlets, I rushed out of the grotto.</p>
<hr class="c"/>
<div class="calibre2"></div><div class="calibre2"></div><h2 id="pgepubid00054" class="calibre3"><a id="CHAPTER_27" class="calibre6"></a>CHAPTER 27</h2>
<h4 id="pgepubid00055" class="calibre7">THE CENTRAL SEA</h4>
<p class="calibre8">At first I saw absolutely nothing. My eyes, wholly unused to the effulgence of light, could not bear the sudden brightness; and I was compelled to close them. When I was able to reopen them, I stood still, far more stupefied than astonished. Not all the wildest effects of imagination could have conjured up such a scene! "The sea—the sea," I cried.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes," replied my uncle, in a tone of pardonable pride; "the Central Sea. No future navigator will deny the fact of my having discovered it; and hence of acquiring a right of giving it a name."</p>
<p class="calibre8">It was quite true. A vast, limitless expanse of water, the end of a lake if not of an ocean, spread before us, until it was lost in the distance. The shore, which was very much indented, consisted of a beautiful soft golden sand, mixed with small shells, the long-deserted home of some of the creatures of a past age. The waves broke incessantly—and with a peculiarly sonorous murmur, to be found in underground localities. A slight frothy flake arose as the wind blew along the pellucid waters; and many a dash of spray was blown into my face. The mighty superstructure of rock which rose above to an inconceivable height left only a narrow opening—but where we stood, there was a large margin of strand. On all sides were capes and promontories and enormous cliffs, partially worn by the eternal breaking of the waves, through countless ages! And as I gazed from side to side, the mighty rocks faded away like a fleecy film of cloud.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It was in reality an ocean, with all the usual characteristics of an inland sea, only horribly wild—so rigid, cold and savage.</p>
<p class="calibre8">One thing startled and puzzled me greatly. How was it that I was able to look upon that vast sheet of water instead of being plunged in utter darkness? The vast landscape before me was lit up like day. But there was wanting the dazzling brilliancy, the splendid irradiation of the sun; the pale cold illumination of the moon; the brightness of the stars. The illuminating power in this subterranean region, from its trembling and Rickering character, its clear dry whiteness, the very slight elevation of its temperature, its great superiority to that of the moon, was evidently electric; something in the nature of the aurora borealis, only that its phenomena were constant, and able to light up the whole of the ocean cavern.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The tremendous vault above our heads, the sky, so to speak, appeared to be composed of a conglomeration of nebulous vapors, in constant motion. I should originally have supposed that, under such an atmospheric pressure as must exist in that place, the evaporation of water could not really take place, and yet from the action of some physical law, which escaped my memory, there were heavy and dense clouds rolling along that mighty vault, partially concealing the roof. Electric currents produced astonishing play of light and shade in the distance, especially around the heavier clouds. Deep shadows were cast beneath, and then suddenly, between two clouds, there would come a ray of unusual beauty, and remarkable intensity. And yet it was not like the sun, for it gave no heat.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The effect was sad and excruciatingly melancholy. Instead of a noble firmament of blue, studded with stars, there was above me a heavy roof of granite, which seemed to crush me.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Gazing around, I began to think of the theory of the English captain who compared the earth to a vast hollow sphere in the interior of which the air is retained in a luminous state by means of atmospheric pressure, while two stars, Pluto and Proserpine, circled there in their mysterious orbits. After all, suppose the old fellow was right!</p>
<p class="calibre8">In truth, we were imprisoned—bound as it were, in a vast excavation. Its width it was impossible to make out; the shore, on either hand, widening rapidly until lost to sight; while its length was equally uncertain. A haze on the distant horizon bounded our view. As to its height, we could see that it must be many miles to the roof. Looking upward, it was impossible to discover where the stupendous roof began. The lowest of the clouds must have been floating at an elevation of two thousand yards, a height greater than that of terrestrial vapors, which circumstance was doubtless owing to the extreme density of the air.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I use the word "cavern" in order to give an idea of the place. I cannot describe its awful grandeur; human language fails to convey an idea of its savage sublimity. Whether this singular vacuum had or had not been caused by the sudden cooling of the earth when in a state of fusion, I could not say. I had read of most wonderful and gigantic caverns—but, none in any way like this.</p>
<p class="calibre8">The great grotto of Guachara, in Colombia, visited by the learned Humboldt; the vast and partially explored Mammoth Cave in Kentucky—what were these holes in the earth to that in which I stood in speechless admiration! with its vapory clouds, its electric light, and the mighty ocean slumbering in its bosom! Imagination, not description, can alone give an idea of the splendor and vastness of the cave.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I gazed at these marvels in profound silence. Words were utterly wanting to indicate the sensations of wonder I experienced. I seemed, as I stood upon that mysterious shore, as if I were some wandering inhabitant of a distant planet, present for the first time at the spectacle of some terrestrial phenomena belonging to another existence. To give body and existence to such new sensations would have required the coinage of new words—and here my feeble brain found itself wholly at fault. I looked on, I thought, I reflected, I admired, in a state of stupefaction not altogether unmingled with fear!</p>
<p class="calibre8">The unexpected spectacle restored some color to my pallid cheeks. I seemed to be actually getting better under the influence of this novelty. Moreover, the vivacity of the dense atmosphere reanimated my body by inflating my lungs with unaccustomed oxygen.</p>
<p class="calibre8">It will be readily conceived that after an imprisonment of forty-seven days, in a dark and miserable tunnel it was with infinite delight that I breathed this saline air. It was like the genial, reviving influence of the salt sea waves.</p>
<p class="calibre8">My uncle had already got over the first surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre8">With the Latin poet Horace his idea was that—</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p class="calibre8">Not to admire is all the art I know,</p>
<p class="calibre8">To make man happy and to keep him so.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre8">"Well," he said, after giving me time thoroughly to appreciate the marvels of this underground sea, "do you feel strong enough to walk up and down?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Certainly," was my ready answer, "nothing would give me greater pleasure."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well then, my boy," he said, "lean on my arm, and we will stroll along the beach."</p>
<p class="calibre8">I accepted his offer eagerly, and we began to walk along the shores of this extraordinary lake. To our left were abrupt rocks, piled one upon the other—a stupendous titanic pile; down their sides leaped innumerable cascades, which at last, becoming limpid and murmuring streams, were lost in the waters of the lake. Light vapors, which rose here and there, and floated in fleecy clouds from rock to rock, indicated hot springs, which also poured their superfluity into the vast reservoir at our feet.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Among them I recognized our old and faithful stream, the Hansbach, which, lost in that wild basin, seemed as if it had been flowing since the creation of the world.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"We shall miss our excellent friend," I remarked, with a deep sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Bah!" said my uncle testily, "what matters it? That or another, it is all the same."</p>
<p class="calibre8">I thought the remark ungrateful, and felt almost inclined to say so; but I forbore.</p>
<p class="calibre8">At this moment my attention was attracted by an unexpected spectacle. After we had gone about five hundred yards, we suddenly turned a steep promontory, and found ourselves close to a lofty forest! It consisted of straight trunks with tufted tops, in shape like parasols. The air seemed to have no effect upon these trees—which in spite of a tolerable breeze remained as still and motionless as if they had been petrified.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I hastened forward. I could find no name for these singular formations. Did they not belong to the two thousand and more known trees—or were we to make the discovery of a new growth? By no means. When we at last reached the forest, and stood beneath the trees, my surprise gave way to admiration.</p>
<p class="calibre8">In truth, I was simply in the presence of a very ordinary product of the earth, of singular and gigantic proportions. My uncle unhesitatingly called them by their real names.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"It is only," he said, in his coolest manner, "a forest of mushrooms."</p>
<p class="calibre8">On close examination I found that he was not mistaken. Judge of the development attained by this product of damp hot soils. I had heard that the Lycoperdon giganteum reaches nine feet in circumference, but here were white mushrooms, nearly forty feet high, and with tops of equal dimensions. They grew in countless thousands—the light could not make its way through their massive substance, and beneath them reigned a gloomy and mystic darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Still I wished to go forward. The cold in the shades of this singular forest was intense. For nearly an hour we wandered about in this visible darkness. At length I left the spot, and once more returned to the shores of the lake, to light and comparative warmth.</p>
<p class="calibre8">But the amazing vegetation of subterraneous land was not confined to gigantic mushrooms. New wonders awaited us at every step. We had not gone many hundred yards, when we came upon a mighty group of other trees with discolored leaves—the common humble trees of Mother Earth, of an exorbitant and phenomenal size: lycopods a hundred feet high; flowering ferns as tall as pines; gigantic grasses!</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Astonishing, magnificent, splendid!" cried my uncle; "here we have before us the whole flora of the second period of the world, that of transition. Behold the humble plants of our gardens, which in the first ages of the world were mighty trees. Look around you, my dear Harry. No botanist ever before gazed on such a sight!"</p>
<p class="calibre8">My uncle's enthusiasm, always a little more than was required, was now excusable.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"You are right, Uncle," I remarked. "Providence appears to have designed the preservation in this vast and mysterious hothouse of antediluvian plants, to prove the sagacity of learned men in figuring them so marvelously on paper."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well said, my boy—very well said; it is indeed a mighty hothouse. But you would also be within the bounds of reason and common sense, if you added that it is also a vast menagerie."</p>
<p class="calibre8">I looked rather anxiously around. If the animals were as exaggerated as the plants, the matter would certainly be serious.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"A menagerie?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Doubtless. Look at the dust we are treading under foot—behold the bones with which the whole soil of the seashore is covered—"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Bones," I replied, "yes, certainly, the bones of antediluvian animals."</p>
<p class="calibre8">I stooped down as I spoke, and picked up one or two singular remains, relics of a bygone age. It was easy to give a name to these gigantic bones, in some instances as big as trunks of trees.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Here is, clearly, the lower jawbone of a mastodon," I cried, almost as warmly and enthusiastically as my uncle; "here are the molars of the Dinotherium; here is a leg bone which belonged to the Megatherium. You are right, Uncle, it is indeed a menagerie; for the mighty animals to which these bones once belonged, have lived and died on the shores of this subterranean sea, under the shadow of these plants. Look, yonder are whole skeletons—and yet—"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"And yet, nephew?" said my uncle, noticing that I suddenly came to a full stop.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"I do not understand the presence of such beasts in granite caverns, however vast and prodigious," was my reply.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Why not?" said my uncle, with very much of his old professional impatience.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Because it is well known that animal life only existed on earth during the secondary period, when the sedimentary soil was formed by the alluviums, and thus replaced the hot and burning rocks of the primitive age."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"I have listened to you earnestly and with patience, Harry, and I have a simple and clear answer to your objections: and that is, that this itself is a sedimentary soil."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"How can that be at such enormous depth from the surface of the earth?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"The fact can be explained both simply and geologically. At a certain period, the earth consisted only of an elastic crust, liable to alternative upward and downward movements in virtue of the law of attraction. It is very probable that many a landslip took place in those days, and that large portions of sedimentary soil were cast into huge and mighty chasms."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Quite possible," I dryly remarked. "But, Uncle, if these antediluvian animals formerly lived in these subterranean regions, what more likely than that one of these monsters may at this moment be concealed behind one of yonder mighty rocks."</p>
<p class="calibre8">As I spoke, I looked keenly around, examining with care every point of the horizon; but nothing alive appeared to exist on these deserted shores.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I now felt rather fatigued, and told my uncle so. The walk and excitement were too much for me in my weak state. I therefore seated myself at the end of a promontory, at the foot of which the waves broke in incessant rolls. I looked round a bay formed by projections of vast granitic rocks. At the extreme end was a little port protected by huge pyramids of stones. A brig and three or four schooners might have lain there with perfect ease. So natural did it seem, that every minute my imagination induced me to expect a vessel coming out under all sail and making for the open sea under the influence of a warm southerly breeze.</p>
<p class="calibre8">But the fantastic illusion never lasted more than a minute. We were the only living creatures in this subterranean world!</p>
<p class="calibre8">During certain periods there was an utter cessation of wind, when a silence deeper, more terrible than the silence of the desert fell upon these solitary and arid rocks—and seemed to hang like a leaden weight upon the waters of this singular ocean. I sought, amid the awful stillness, to penetrate through the distant fog, to tear down the veil which concealed the mysterious distance. What unspoken words were murmured by my trembling lips—what questions did I wish to ask and did not! Where did this sea end—to what did it lead? Should we ever be able to examine its distant shores?</p>
<p class="calibre8">But my uncle had no doubts about the matter. He was convinced that our enterprise would in the end be successful. For my part, I was in a state of painful indecision—I desired to embark on the journey and to succeed, and still I feared the result.</p>
<p class="calibre8">After we had passed an hour or more in silent contemplation of the wondrous spectacle, we rose and went down towards the bank on our way to the grotto, which I was not sorry to gain. After a slight repast, I sought refuge in slumber, and at length, after many and tedious struggles, sleep came over my weary eyes.</p>

<h4 id="pgepubid00057" class="calibre7">LAUNCHING THE RAFT</h4>
<p class="calibre8">On the morning of the next day, to my great surprise, I awoke completely restored. I thought a bath would be delightful after my long illness and sufferings. So, soon after rising, I went and plunged into the waters of this new Mediterranean. The bath was cool, fresh and invigorating.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I came back to breakfast with an excellent appetite. Hans, our worthy guide, thoroughly understood how to cook such eatables as we were able to provide; he had both fire and water at discretion, so that he was enabled slightly to vary the weary monotony of our ordinary repast.</p>
<p class="calibre8">Our morning meal was like a capital English breakfast, with coffee by way of a windup. And never had this delicious beverage been so welcome and refreshing.</p>
<p class="calibre8">My uncle had sufficient regard for my state of health not to interrupt me in the enjoyment of the meal, but he was evidently delighted when I had finished.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Now then," said he, "come with me. It is the height of the tide, and I am anxious to study its curious phenomena."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"What!"' I cried, rising in astonishment, "did you say the tide, Uncle?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Certainly I did."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"You do not mean to say," I replied, in a tone of respectful doubt, "that the influence of the sun and moon is felt here below."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"And pray why not? Are not all bodies influenced by the law of universal attraction? Why should this vast underground sea be exempt from the general law, the rule of the universe? Besides, there is nothing like that which is proved and demonstrated. Despite the great atmospheric pressure down here, you will notice that this inland sea rises and falls with as much regularity as the Atlantic itself."</p>
<p class="calibre8">As my uncle spoke, we reached the sandy shore, and saw and heard the waves breaking monotonously on the beach. They were evidently rising.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"This is truly the flood," I cried, looking at the water at my feet.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes, my excellent nephew," replied my uncle, rubbing his hands with the gusto of a philosopher, "and you see by these several streaks of foam that the tide rises at least ten or twelve feet."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"It is indeed marvelous."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"By no means," he responded; "on the contrary, it is quite natural."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"It may appear so in your eyes, my dear uncle," was my reply, "but all the phenomena of the place appear to me to partake of the marvelous. It is almost impossible to believe that which I see. Who in his wildest dreams could have imagined that, beneath the crust of our earth, there could exist a real ocean, with ebbing and flowing tides, with its changes of winds, and even its storms! I for one should have laughed the suggestion to scorn."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"But, Harry, my boy, why not?" inquired my uncle, with a pitying smile; "is there any physical reason in opposition to it?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, if we give up the great theory of the central heat of the earth, I certainly can offer no reasons why anything should be looked upon as impossible."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Then you will own," he added, "that the system of Sir Humphry Davy is wholly justified by what we have seen?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"I allow that it is—and that point once granted, I certainly can see no reason for doubting the existence of seas and other wonders, even countries, in the interior of the globe."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"That is so—but of course these varied countries are uninhabited?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, I grant that it is more likely than not: still, I do not see why this sea should not have given shelter to some species of unknown fish."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Hitherto we have not discovered any, and the probabilities are rather against our ever doing so," observed the Professor.</p>
<p class="calibre8">I was losing my skepticism in the presence of these wonders.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well, I am determined to solve the question. It is my intention to try my luck with my fishing line and hook."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Certainly; make the experiment," said my uncle, pleased with my enthusiasm. "While we are about it, it will certainly be only proper to discover all the secrets of this extraordinary region."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"But, after all, where are we now?" I asked; "all this time I have quite forgotten to ask you a question, which, doubtless, your philosophical instruments have long since answered."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Well," replied the Professor, "examining the situation from only one point of view, we are now distant three hundred and fifty leagues from Iceland."</p>
<p class="calibre8">"So much?" was my exclamation.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"I have gone over the matter several times, and am sure not to have made a mistake of five hundred yards," replied my uncle positively.</p>
<p class="calibre8">"And as to the direction—are we still going to the southeast?"</p>
<p class="calibre8">"Yes, with a western declination<a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="part0005.html#Footnote_2_2">[2]</a> of nineteen degrees, forty-two minutes, just as it is above. As for the inclination<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a class="fnanchor" href="part0005.html#Footnote_3_3">[3]</a> I have discovered a very curious fact."</p>
