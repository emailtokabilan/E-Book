<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre5">“Probably the best</span> place to set down,” Franklin said. “Their apartment’s only a few blocks over.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon dropped down over the debris-filled remains of Central Park’s Wollman Ice Rink. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">In a few hours,</span> he thought, <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">on any normal weekday, happy skaters would begin to fill it.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Not today.</span> At three hundred feet above the rink, Everon hesitated.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">There were not even people running into the open areas to escape the flames and falling concrete here. Just death.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Gushing streams of water flowed upward from somewhere beneath the ground, producing a disgusting mixture of wreckage and bodies. Dead skaters, fewer children — it had been eight o’clock when the bomb went off. Limbs separated from torsos, mixed with trash and sewage, brick and steel girder stirred into a killing soup of vast proportion.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Never before had such common concentrated murder been allowed inside America.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“When the blast hit,” Chuck commented, “people were just going out on the town — probably having the time of their lives.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Cynthia, Steve, Melissa can’t be part of that!” Franklin said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I wonder how the pigeons made out?” Chuck muttered, looking away. “Especially baby pigeons. I’ve never seen one. They must hide somewhere, sick and limping in the crannies around buildings. Even an atom bomb couldn’t kill all the pigeons in New York City.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Watching the mess flow beneath, the big Red Cross man added, “This is going to affect all of us for a long, long time.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin felt like telling Chuck to just shut up. But he understood. It was the big man’s way of dealing with something none of them had ever seen before.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“That area doesn’t look too bad,” Chuck pointed to an open area of ice rink.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Wet and shiny but mostly clear of debris.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon nodded and set up his approach. The ice glared up at him.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">They were less than two hundred feet above when Chuck asked, “Did you see — I thought I saw something move.” He pointed to the middle of the ice. “Something’s running around down there!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin looked through the binoculars. Several dark-colored seals were huddled together in the middle of the rink, heads moving back and forth.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Seals.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Okay,” Chuck said, “but what’s that?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon pulled up suddenly. “No fucking way we’re landing here!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Two huge polar bears, nearly invisible until the Pelican had dropped low enough to tell them from the ice, had taken down a pair of seals and were ripping the carcasses to shreds.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin swept the binoculars around the outside of the rink. A group of five spotted leopards of some type Franklin didn’t recognize padded the rink edge. It was difficult to say whether the leopards were more concerned about the bears or the ice. But they kept their distance. Two of the big cats were ripping at pieces of something. Something that looked like it was covered in cloth or skin.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon gained altitude and crabbed east.</p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer085" class="p_div_ork-plaza"><span><img alt="" src="image61.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_s_graphic_after_no_indent">read the remaining stylish gold letters. The thin wide sign lay in thick gray dust.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Looks like the top of the 9 Building was blasted back into the Plaza Hotel behind it,” Everon said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Chunks of the hotel all the way to the zoo cages?” Chuck said. “That’s like four blocks.” A terrible darkness rode on the Red Cross man’s voice. “What about the Sheep Meadow? That’s probably better. Over that way, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Our sister’s place is on the east side,” Franklin replied grimly. “Too far. The Sheep Meadow is in the mid-60s on the west side. Cynthia’s just north of 59th. Altogether, that would leave us a two-mile walk. With who knows what — animals — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">whatever,</span> in our way.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Addressing Everon, he pointed through the windshield, “Their apartment should be straight east from the bottom of the park.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I wonder why the damage is so much worse around here,” Chuck said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I don’t know, dammit!” Franklin shouted back. “Go east, Everon.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon complied silently, angling the Pelican to the right.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He took them higher to pass over what had been several taller buildings, hovering above an area depressed as if that same giant’s palm which destroyed Lower Manhattan leaned in here. But more selectively — smashing only certain buildings, leaving others. Down Fifth Avenue, their top halves were broken off but before they’d crumbled had offered their protection to St. Patrick’s. But for a few missing feet of its ornate upper spires, the old cathedral looked untouched.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“The pattern’s different here too,” Franklin said. “Look how the pressure turned away here, more toward the Upper <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">West</span> Side.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon gritted his teeth at his brother’s unrealistic hopefulness.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">They crossed Park Avenue. Far down to their right, Everon recognized the top of the big hotel that spanned the avenue, broken off and sitting amid other rubble in the wide divider.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">And around the wreckage, more bodies! In the streets. On the sidewalks. Always the bodies.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin peered through the smoke ahead. A Roosevelt Island Tram car hung slanted by a single wheel, like a child hanging from a clothesline by one finger, stalled within shouting distance of its station. A tickle, a breath of wind, and down it would go. No one looked back through its cracked windows.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He began to feel that same sense of dread he’d felt hanging there under Ash Cave rising inside him; changes in his face, his body’s posture. Seeing the trail of death below was like tracking the worst serial killer of all time. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Why,</span> he wondered, <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">are there so many stories about biblically-influenced serial killers? What is it those psychopaths aren’t supposed to feel about something like this, the average person does?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“One thing’s certain,” he whispered, “there’ll be a lot to talk about at the church Sunday morning.”</span></p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer086" class="p_divider1"><span><img alt="" src="image62.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">“Cynthia’s apartment should</span> be somewhere over there. Within a two-block radius. About —”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin was pointing right at another ball of flame in the middle of Lexington Avenue. Almost as large as the one that nearly brought them down at Columbus Circle, the big yellow fireball expanded, from the size of a misshapen hot air balloon to something much bigger, completely blocking their view of the building behind and below. Heat rocked the craft.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The balloon shrank back. They tried to see around it.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I think that’s — just off that corner there. It — it doesn’t look as though there’s anything left,” he said dismally. “Hold on!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What?” Everon asked, hovering them above a row of converted red and yellow brick five-story walk-ups.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“That file cabinet! On the corner of that building. Right there! It looks like the one Cynthia decorated with those big yellow sunflowers.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Where?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“There!” Franklin pointed.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">There was so much smoke. Determined, Everon edged in closer.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Oh — sure as hell does!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Other than a few partial walls between apartments, the entire floor looked like it had been flattened.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“They keep that file cabinet in Melissa’s room!” Franklin said. “Cynthia added those plastic flowers herself to make it fit the nursery. They didn’t have a separate office. Only the two bedrooms.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Jagged teeth of red brick jutted upward, part of the remaining nursery-office wall, acting like a shield against the cabinet’s east fire-blasted Lexington Avenue side. The fireball began to expand again. Roiling hot air buffeted the blades hard on the close side, pushing them away.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Maybe they weren’t home,” Franklin said as he looked through the binoculars. A two-inch-wide corner of some pink material hung from the front right of the third drawer down, fluttering in the wind caused by the flame. And then a bizarre thought fluttered through his mind. He closed his eyes for a moment. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">No!</span> he mouthed silently, shaking his head.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">But the thought wouldn’t leave.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I don’t see any place to land around here,” Franklin said. “Let me rappel down on top!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I can’t fly directly over the building with that burning gas right next to it,” Everon yelled back. “Too dangerous. That empty lot there would be good. But it’s too uneven with all that shit in it. Have to keep the blades level.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Chuck leaned closer to the brothers and cupped a hand, “I thought I saw another open spot — a block up.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Where?” Everon asked.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Around the corner of that squat building. Over there — that ten-story on the corner. We can run back from there and take a closer look. Follow that crevasse,” Chuck pointed.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Looks like a collapsed subway,” Franklin said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Then around that one —” Chuck said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon flew east, over the collapsed center of the street. “What do we show for radiation?” he shouted.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Chuck held the gray box closer to his face. “Level’s between zero-point-one and zero-point-two rads. Less than a chest X-ray an hour.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Alright.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">A block farther on, Everon let the Pelican hover over Chuck’s spot. Its middle appeared to have once been a wide fountain. Only the outer rim remained.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Looks clear,” Franklin called out, looking down through the binoculars. “Is it wide enough?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“It’ll do,” Everon said. He descended straight down. Light winds had been following them from New Jersey — from the west. Now Everon noticed a change. He no longer had to compensate. There seemed to be no drift at all.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">The wind is changing, </span>he thought, picturing the deadly cloud anvilled out over Long Island.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Not good.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">To their left a marble statue, a trumpeting angel, looked like it had been blasted from the middle of the fountain into a plate-glass window. He put the Pelican’s wheels gently onto the fountain’s concrete center and hesitated. He hadn’t yet shut the helicopter down. He had no idea if he’d be able to restart it.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He took a deep breath and pulled the mixture back. And the engine fell away.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">To the sounds of a burning city.</p>
