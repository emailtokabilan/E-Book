<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre5">“We have to</span> get out of here now,” Franklin said, gritting his teeth as the icy water bit like needles into his calves.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The dark-haired woman he’d seen in the window sat sideways, legs across several seats just out of the water’s reach. She appeared to be in pain. Her dark mid-length coat was pulled around her. One of her long, smooth legs was interrupted by what looked like thin tubes of rolled newspaper strapped to her leg’s sides, and an obnoxious-looking knee that bulged under the skin.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“How’d you get up to the window?” Franklin asked her.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I pulled myself up on the bars. Had to.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Are you able to walk?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Not much. My leg feels like it’s broken.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He sloshed over, examined her knee. “Dislocated, looks like. There’s a man up top who’ll know better. I think we can get you out okay.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">As she stared up at him, blood matted along the right side of her face, Franklin thought, <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">She doesn’t seem to be bleeding anymore.</span> He frowned at her vague familiarity. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Probably looks a lot better without that blood in her hair.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">He looked around. “Anybody else hurt?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Mr. van Patter,” she nodded toward the elderly gentleman, “was unconscious when I woke up.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I’m alright,” van Patter said lightly. “Just a little bump on the noggin. I’ll be fine.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Well <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">I’m</span> not fine!” said the man in the soggy toupee. The screamer. “Tyner Kone,” he announced. “U.S. Department of Commerce! I want answers! How bad is it up there?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“No good deed goes unpunished,” a voice echoed from above.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin looked up to see his brother’s upside-down head wiggle through the now-missing window. Everon winked at the dark-haired young woman. “I wonder if he knows his hairpiece is on crooked?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">She barked out a high laugh.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin understood his brother’s strategy. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Keep them from going further into shock. </span>The water was rising. Everon looked at him as if to say, <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Let’s get to what we came for!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Your attempt at humor is not appropriate, nor appreciated,” Kone fumed. He straightened his toupee and pointed. “This water is probably loaded with radiation. How do you propose to get us out of here?” Kone pointed to Everon. “How far is it?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon looked at Franklin. “Chuck and I used the winch to break out that metal grate. We can take everybody straight up.” He wiggled backward and disappeared.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Alright then. Pull me up!” Kone said. “Let’s go!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin considered the opening — against the bureaucrat’s round shape. Despite Everon’s ability to wiggle through the small tunnel they’d made, it would be too tight for some of them. For sure Kone wouldn’t fit. He wouldn’t even make it through the window.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Yeah, let’s go, man! Water’s coming up fast!” <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">StreetNews!</span> Cap’s rising voice was sounding more like Kone’s.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“If we try to pull you up through that hole, all we’ll succeed in doing is getting you stuck halfway and wind up cutting the rope.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin looked at the dark-haired woman. There was no way to get someone with a bad leg through either. He studied the train car doors and knew what he had to do.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What’s your name?” he asked.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Victoria.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“All right, Victoria. We have to move you. I need to get everybody to the other side of the car.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Okay,” she said, despite what he suspected was considerable pain.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">As much as possible they had to avoid the water. Not because it was cold, but because the bomb had exploded only a few miles away, somewhere downtown near the water. He hadn’t brought Chuck’s radiation meter with him. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">It all depends,</span> he realized, <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">on which way the East River is flowing.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin heard the word again. “Bomba? Bomba?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">A man with sandy-brown hair, his arm around a slim blonde woman in a fur-lined coat bunched around her neck, both in their mid-thirties, had remained silent the whole time. Now they whispered frantically to each other. It seemed they didn’t understand what was going on.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“New York bombili,” </span>Franklin said<span class="c_span_body-char-italic"> — </span>the same thing he’d told the others. The couple looked at each other. “Bomba?” the woman asked, staring at him wide-eyed.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Bomba! Da! Ya skazal vam!”  — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Bomb! Yeah! I told you! </span>The man looked back to Franklin, who nodded grimly.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What are they speaking?” Mr. van Patter asked.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Russian.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What did he say? What did he say?” Kone asked. But Franklin didn’t answer.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The guy in the <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">StreetNews!</span> cap said, “Let me give you a hand. Name’s Clarence.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin and Clarence carefully slid their arms beneath Victoria’s legs. The Russian guy lifted her feet. The dark-haired young woman grimaced as they carried her to a seat on the opposite side. Drew breath sharply as they set her down. It was going to be tough getting her up. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Maybe I can help her feel better, </span>Franklin thought. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">If she’s consciously willing to let me do it.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Ultimately it would have to be her decision.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“If I can reduce your pain before we go up, would you go along with it?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What, a pill or something?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Half her pain’s internal,</span> Franklin was certain. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Induced by fear — of what might be wrong with her knee, wondering if it will heal. A second part caused by wondering whether she’ll even get out of here.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">“No . . . something mental.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Uh — I don’t know. I guess so.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">But Franklin’s mind was already tuned in to everything about her — a lightning comparison of her vocal accent and vocal tone — her body posture, even what he could see in the limited light of the dilation of her pupils. The swelling of her full lips, down to the nearly invisible tension in the pores of the smooth skin across her cheeks. All of it poured into him, affected him, and was processed.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Like a well-practiced musician, responding in ways he was barely aware of, Franklin gave himself an inner nod, and in a low insistent voice, whispered in her ear, “<span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Victoria</span><span class="c_span_er-char-italic"> . . . DEEP INSIDE YOU CAN FALL ASLEEP, REST, ARRIVE AT A DEEPER . . . PLACE TO RELAX, UNWIND, CHILL OUT, VOUS DORMEZ, CALMING . . .”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">She frowned at him. But underneath, she felt her breathing slow . . .</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What are you telling her?” Kone said, voice rising again.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin ignored him.<span class="c_span_er-char-italic"> “. . . DOWN DEEPER TO LOOSEN UP, LIGHTEN UP, USTED DUERME . . . SETTLE DOWN . . . SPAT’ . . . FEEL AND SENSE AND EXPERIENCE . . . UNDERGO TO CHANGE AND BE ALLOWING . . . YOU YOURSELF TO JUST LET GO AS</span><span class="c_span_er-char-bold-italic"> . . . YOU . . . CANCEL . . . PAIN.”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">She felt a flow of energy through her calves, down into her feet.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Since she had given, at least, her conscious agreement, Franklin was using an ultra-abbreviated form of what he’d used to convince Chuck Farndike to set up their Red Cross clearance. But where he’d helped Chuck amplify his uncomfortableness, he did the opposite with <span class="calibre14">“. . . V</span><span class="c_span_er-char-italic">ICTORIA . . . RELAXING . . . DEEPER NOW . . .”</span><span class="c_span_er-char-bold-italic"> </span>Dropping his pitch and volume, his tone deeper still . . .</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The third time he said it he looked suddenly away, gently squeezed her shoulder.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">What’s all that about?</span> she frowned. Then oddly realized she didn’t feel so frightened . . . And the throbbing in her knee was diminishing too . . .</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Canceling her pain,</span> he knew, <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">carries a danger of its own: The pain is there for a reason, a warning: Be careful! Something’s damaged!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">But now he could do what he had to. The water was pouring in at an alarming rate. Franklin pulled the rock hammer from his harness and stepped to one side of the big window in the other door. He waved a hand and spoke to the Russian couple, who immediately stepped back.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What’s going on?” Kone asked.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“You might want to back up,” he told the others.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">They all moved back. Except Kone. “What do you think you’re doing?” he asked, voice bordering on hysteria.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Ignore him,” van Patter said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Cowed for some reason by the older gentleman, Kone obediently stepped over, up on the seats where Victoria and van Patter sat and the others stood.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin hauled the hammer back and smacked the glass. A shuddering split appeared in the window’s lower left corner. He swung back to take another swing, but a high rippling sound snaked its way diagonally upward across the window and . . . <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">SNAP!</span> Shattered glass exploded into the car. Pieces of tile and gray cement dust poured in, chips of concrete, red bricks laid down a century ago — splashed into the still rising water.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">A dirt pile rose fast in the water in the center aisle.</p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer107" class="p_divider5"><span><img alt="" src="image79.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">Within seconds, dirt</span> had risen above the water. Then a foot above and still the pile grew. As they scooped it back to make room for more, struggling to keep up, Franklin began to wonder if he’d miscalculated.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">How much can there be?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Clarence, the Russians and the transit engineer pushed bricks and dirt into the water away from the rising mound. More light poked through. Van Patter moved several smaller bricks then wobbled back to a seat, ready to fall over. Victoria used her sleeve to wipe away the small trail of blood that dribbled down his face.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Kone stood on the opposite side seat next to Victoria and watched.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“We didn’t know how much stuff was above us,” Clarence said as they worked. “We should have tried.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">And then it slowed. The dirt had taken space where the water had been. The water was rising even faster now.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">More chunks of loose rock rolled down. Franklin could hear Everon digging above. The casual refrain of a familiar tune floated down, Everon’s voice off-key, “I’ve been diggin’ on the railroad, all the livelong day . . .”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">A couple of people smiled.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin used the short claw of his rock hammer between the door seals and wedged them an inch apart. The Russian guy splashed into the water, grabbed one side of the rubber strip, the engineer’s hands above his. Clarence and Franklin slid their fingers onto the opposing side.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Slowly they forced the doors wide open. As more dirt poured in, they shoved it to the sides. The pile rose above the seat bottoms, then even with the water. Hands began to bleed. They kept at it until they had a slot up through the dirt, large enough that even Kone could slide through easily.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">They stood on the seats, water to their knees and coming in fast.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Normally I’d say ladies and injured people first,” Franklin rushed now, “But we’ll need some muscle up top.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Figuring the Russian guy would want to stay until his lady had gotten clear, he looked at Clarence.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“We’ll take Victoria here up next. Can you help my brother, guide her?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Okay, okay — let’s go!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Okay — his name’s Everon — tell him I’ll give three short tugs when we’re ready then take it really slow. Since he’s got the grate cleared, you’ll want to take her straight up to street level. Do you need the winch to pull you up?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Clarence glanced at the opening. “No way, man.” Like a mole, the <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">StreetNews!</span> guy scrambled up through the chute, shooting loose dirt into the water behind. His feet disappeared as if he’d been grabbed from above.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">While Franklin tightened a harness strap just below Victoria’s gold skirt, the Russian sloshed through the stomach-high water to the doors, lifted his woman up and shoved against the bottoms of her shoes. She surprised them all, darting upward nearly as fast as Clarence. Victoria watched the woman’s mobility with something like envy. Embarrassment flashed across her face. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">She wishes she could do it herself,</span> Franklin realized.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">When he moved around to her other leg, the strap was already on, the buckle tightened down. He looked up at her.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">She shrugged. “It seemed the right way to do it.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">She looped an arm around Franklin’s neck and the transit engineer helped her across the rising water, around the pile of brick and wet gray dirt to the car’s other side. Franklin gave the rope three sharp pulls and its slack was taken up.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Victoria Hill watched the wiry, dark-haired man as he guided her head carefully upward to the hole. Just before the train car’s interior dropped away, she saw what the lack of light had hidden. His irises. Electric cobalt blue.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Water rose above the seat backs, touched the lower edge of the train’s windows.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Kone coughed and scratched at his nose. For someone in a hurry to go — now Kone didn’t want to leave the train car! Making an odd superstitious kind of motion, touching opposite shoulders several times — as if to even himself out somehow. Water halfway up his chest, Franklin ignored it, gave the rope a tug.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Kone halfway up the hole, the engineer looked at Franklin as they strained against the little bureaucrat’s bulk. “Feels like the chub’s pushing back!” the engineer grunted.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Finally Kone’s weight left their hands and his shoes disappeared.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Walter van Patter followed quite quickly, spry for someone so old. The Russian went next. Franklin pushed the engineer up into the hole right on the Russian’s heels.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">By the time the engineer was up, Franklin’s chest was completely submerged in the freezing water. He felt with the toes of his right climbing shoe onto the top corner of the plastic seat back and pushed off to propel himself up into the chute.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The dirt around him was loose, turning to mud. He couldn’t get a grip. The mud shifted. He slid backward as he clawed against it. The earth offered no support at all.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The hole’s sides were loosening. He could feel the loose gray mud pressing inward on his waist, his shoulders. He scrabbled faster, trying to grab onto something, anything, cupping his hands like scoops.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The mud grew softer, washing backward without any purchase at all. The water was to his neck, closing the hole around him, squeezing his legs, freezing water rising over his chin. He kicked desperately, trying to dig forward with his knees.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">His right knee found a sharp object, an embedded brick or something in the muck and he pushed against it. But it sloughed backward. He was going down. Water closed over his chin, his mouth, his nose, his eyes. He could see nothing but a gray milky white.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Even that disappeared in darkness.</p>
