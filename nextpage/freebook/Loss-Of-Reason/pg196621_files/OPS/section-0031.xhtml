<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre8">“What’s he doing?” </span>Bonnie Fisk screamed. She watched the woman fall as the air was forced from Bonnie’s chest, crushed against a thousand others. She was being slowly pushed toward the bridge’s side.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Bonnie wrenched her neck back to look at the man with long dark hair rising toward the helicopter, away from the long orange truck-trailer — as she slid another two feet toward the hole.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Ahhhheee!”</span> she screamed. Someone’s elbow felt like it was going right through her bladder — which reacted, unfortunately, by letting loose, wetting her size-fourteen peach knit slacks. As co-owners of Fiskmart, the sixth largest national chain of retail big box shopping marts, Bonnie and her sister Barbara were worth billions. On the GW’s upper deck today, she was no different than anyone else. Mauled and sliding, bumping, moving inexorably <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">toward that goddamn hole.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">The dark-haired man was leaving them. He was giving up. The helicopter couldn’t lift the orange trailer.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Today Bonnie had clung to only one possession. Her keys. And when the dark-haired man beneath the helicopter glanced her way, she put every bit of her considerable strength into throwing them.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">They sailed in an arc. Hit him right on the neck.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He stared at her. She pointed.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">At the silver container box on the other side of the bridge.</p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer136" class="p_divider1"><span><img alt="" src="image100.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">Chuck had Franklin</span> halfway up to the Pelican when he saw Franklin wave his right hand and point. He stopped the hoist. Franklin was pointing across the bridge at another 18-wheeler that lay across the outbound lanes. The FedEx and the dumper wedged at its tail against the north bridge railing.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Chuck ducked back to Everon. “He doesn’t want to come up! He’s pointing to the rear of the silver one!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“They’re too heavy! And that one’s got a cab on it too. Reel him in! We have to go back and tell somebody else. Maybe the military can do it.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Chuck hesitated. “Okay.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">As Chuck Farndike went for the hoist controls, he felt a tug on his sleeve. Walter van Patter. He leaned his head in close to the billionaire’s mouth.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What color was the first truck?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Orange,” Chuck answered.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“The orange ones are ocean going,” van Patter said. “They’re made of steel. The silver ones will be lighter. They’re aluminum.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Chuck went forward and told Everon.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon doubted they could lift it either.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Unless it’s empty,” Chuck said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Manhattan, Everon knew, was mostly a consumer. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Coming out of the city after a delivery somewhere like the Garment District maybe? </span>He was sure what Franklin would say. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Look at how many people are down there! Cyn could be one of them — Steve and Melissa, they could </span>all<span class="c_span_body-char-italic"> be!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">“There’s no refrigeration unit either!” Chuck told him. “It’s not a meat or fish packer. Might be coming out empty, right?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“We tried!” Kone complained. “Now let’s get out of here!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Shut up!” a half dozen voices yelled back.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon hovered them directly over the back end of the long silver truck, keeping his blade-to-streetlight distance firmly in mind.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Dangling below the helicopter, Franklin glanced at the sky. Far to the east it looked like the dark cloud had bunched up, upper winds pushing it back into a ball. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">It’s reversing!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">And then realized suddenly, <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">I’m descending. They’re lowering me back down.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">The soles of his shoes contacted the silver 18-wheeler’s top and registered the shaking pressure of the crowd pushing against it.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">This time Everon seemed to know how long the cables were below him.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">As the helicopter hovered over to the big rig’s corner, Franklin quickly pulled the hook with him, slid it into the corner eye farthest from the crowd.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He leaned into one of the lift cables to steady himself. Far east, high in the sky, the cloud vied for his attention.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">It’s no longer moving away from us! It’s coming!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">The mob seemed to sense it too. People pushing harder, faster. He could feel it in his feet. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Pressure. The force on each person must be tremendous. No oversold sporting event has ever seen anything like this. </span>All along the middle of the bridge people were pouring over the sides.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The Pelican began to climb. Everon could feel it in the controls. He was at the top of the lift harness now. Slowly, slowly up the long box came.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Feels like this one’s empty!” he muttered.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">A fuel feed light blinked on, glowing above his head. Power on the right turbine gauge dropped <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">out. “NO! NOT NOW!”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">They were losing power. It felt like the main rotor blades were drooping.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">They were going down.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Without thinking, his left hand twisted the throttle, yanked the collective arm upward, until it was angled as high off the floor as he could pull. The other turbine <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">strained</span> to keep up, whining, growling, screaming. He eyeballed its temperature gauge as the needle snuck into the red. If they lost the Number One engine here above the bridge like this, rotor blades catching in the bridge piping above these people, it was all over.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">No way! Got to get it restarted in the air!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">He’d been running the right engine off the rear tank, the left engine off the front. He hit the boost switches. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Too late for that.</span> Its flame was already out. The rotor continued to lose RPMs.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">And then Everon felt the automatic stabilizer system drop out too.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The Pelican rocked in the air, her controls suddenly super-sensitive. Overhead a chip light from the rear crankcase illuminated. He knew what that was. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Pieces of metal getting inside the gearbox. This thing is more of a mess than I realized. We shouldn’t even be in the air!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Down below, Franklin watched with a kind of detached fatalistic awe, the helicopter slowly descending on top of him.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He didn’t even have time to move.</p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer137" class="p_divider1"><span><img alt="" src="image101.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">Everon glanced at</span> Clarence in the left seat and pointed upward with his chin. “Hit that switch!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Which one?” Clarence gulped.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“The one marked right engine boost pump, front tank!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Clarence flipped it.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Move that lever,” Everon pointed with his eyes to the overhead console. “Twist it! From <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">left tank</span> — to <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">crossfeed — </span>the right engine.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Clarence moved the lever to the first notch.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“One more!”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">The newspaper vendor twisted the black lever all the way over.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Now this one here,” Everon nosed, “the speed selector lever — to SHUTOFF.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He waited a few moments, licked his lips. “Okay, push the start button on Turbine Two.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Here?” Clarence asked.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“HIT IT!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Clarence pushed. Nothing.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">In back, the transit engineer crossed his fingers in front of himself. The Russians joined him, making the sign of the cross.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Then they all felt it. A vibration.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon glanced at the gauge for Turbine Two. The needle jumped. It was restarting. As the rotor’s torque increased, the blades felt springier. As the right turbine spun up, he felt a power surge.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">They climbed.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin’s senses were overwhelmed by the screams of people falling off the sides of the bridge now, screams of people smashed against tractor-trailers, legs and bodies forced against cars, breaking glass, crumpling metal.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He was kneeling on top of the silver trailer, trying to push the big hook out of the box’s corner metal eye, when he realized the helicopter’s pitch overhead was changing. He looked up. The helicopter’s bottom was feet above his head<span class="c_span_body-char-italic"> — But — it doesn’t seem to be getting any lower.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">The thick heavy-lift cables tightened. His hand barely moved in time to keep from getting crushed when the hook yanked itself straight in the box eye.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The trailer’s corner, its entire rear end, slowly rose. Higher. Several inches. Without pause, the helicopter immediately moved sideways. The cables grew tighter, pulling the rear of the whole trailer backward. A foot — two feet — dragging its end away from the other truck blocking the road, away from the cars stuck beneath it. And away from the fighting struggling compressed mass of people pressed against it.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">The now cheering mob!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">As though it were the start of the New York City Marathon — one that might never be run again, like releasing a torrent of water from a breaking dam, thousands burst toward freedom.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">And ran with everything they had.</p>
