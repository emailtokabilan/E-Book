<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre5">Houses rose toward</span> them — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">a baseball diamond. Could I make that? Too far. That parking lot? Power lines.</span> Everon fought himself not to white-knuckle the machine, to continue <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">feeling</span> the controls.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“It’s going to be close,” he muttered.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin kept one eye on Melissa, the other on his brother’s face. He couldn’t recall ever having seen Everon like this, this — pure focused rage it looked like — none of his typical sarcastic humor. Franklin’s fingers slid off the triangle base of the small gold cross beneath his shirt, then brushed the soft feathers of the owl’s head.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">And then he saw it clearly. It had been a personally dangerous, altruistic and foolhardy thing they’d done to release all those people on the bridge. He and Everon had put their own lives at risk out of grief and desperation. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Thinking we’d failed Cynthia and Steve. How could I have let these strangers become more important than my own sister?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Now that they were certain Cynthia was dead, Franklin felt a kind of pure, blind hatred like nothing he’d ever felt before. But nobody knew who to hate. Only a desperate need to somehow strike back, do something drastic.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">In the co-pilot seat to Everon’s left, Clarence’s hands clenched around the base of his seat cushion. He felt his stomach rise, the ground coming toward them at an alarming rate, trees, buildings — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Fuck! I knew I should have worn the green shirt yesterday! Life is always better, safer in the green shirt! </span>But it was so hard to sell newspapers when he was smelly.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Down ahead of Everon, a power line appeared across their path. But they were committed. A messy crash — death for everyone if he snagged it. He pushed the yoke forward.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">They fell faster.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The transit engineer looked at his digital wristwatch. Strange. He hadn’t noticed. The numbers hadn’t changed. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Eight-zero-zero. Does it mean something? Can’t be good. Stomach feels like it’s in my throat.</span> Certain numbers had always been lucky for him. Never double zero.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Are we going to make it past this power line? </span>Everon asked silently. With no engine, they were dropping on a steep angle, free-falling, only a small amount of resistance from the main rotor, in full auto-rotate. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">No time to bring the tail around. </span>He jerked hard back on the yoke. Shoulders hunched, Everon pulled his head into his neck waiting for the tail to strike.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Despite cold air whistling through the cracks, small bubbles of perspiration formed on Tyner Kone’s upper lip. As the Pelican fell, he rushed to make certain he was balanced. With his right hand, nervously he tapped his left shoulder, then more softly with his left hand tapped his right. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Too hard on the left,</span> he thought. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Must have balance!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">There was no deadly tilt, no sudden jerk. Ground flying at them, Everon’s left hand yanked on the collective arm almost ripping it from the floor.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The Russian woman Kat felt like suddenly she weighed a thousand pounds. Despite the security of Petre’s arm around her shoulder, she had known this was how it would end for them since yesterday. That flock of pitch-black crows in Queens landing on a street pole, beaks cawing loudly — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">right at her! The most evil sign!</span> A warning she hadn’t understood — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">until now! The bomb! The subway! To die finally smashed into the ground!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">They slammed in hard. Then <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">bounced!</span> Off the Pelican’s balloon tires — six, eight, ten feet in the air. Then fell, hit again, not so hard this time, and <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">settled</span> — to near stillness.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon’s breath shot from his lips. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">FFFFffff . . .</span> like air going from the tires. He looked around.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Alright back there?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“We’re okay!” Franklin yelled.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Well I’m not —”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">But for the semiconscious Walter van Patter, the again bitching Tyner Kone, they all clapped and cheered.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">They were on the airport runway. A hundred feet from the nearest tent.</p>
