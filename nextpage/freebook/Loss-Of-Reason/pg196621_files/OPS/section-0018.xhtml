<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre5">High in the</span> distance, a billion gallons of radioactive water vapor glimmered — a giant rising cumulonimbus. Its top had to be more than twenty thousand feet, Everon figured — high enough to be knocked by strong west winds into the familiar anvil head fanning over Long Island.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Not twenty miles south, Everon’s dad was buried, and his gaze lingered in that direction as if to catch a glimpse of a graveyard too far to see.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin looked out the left side window to the north. It was growing lighter as they crossed over the Hudson River, the Pelican’s long rotor blades whumping above. The George Washington Bridge surprised him. The long blue-gray span was still connected and appeared undamaged. Cables still hung below their huge curved support pipes where they were supposed to be.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He pulled a pair of powerful binoculars from his bag. “Looks like the GW’s okay,” he yelled, the hopeful sound in his voice rising over the rotor blades. “If the bridge — then maybe —” There were no cars moving over the upper level. A severe jam in the bridge’s middle was blocking traffic.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon ignored his own growing suspicions about Cyn, involuntary moisture forming on the surface of his eyes. He held his own thoughts tightly corked inside. If he recalled correctly, yesterday would have been Franklin’s mother’s birthday. He felt the same as Franklin. But there was no time to voice his own more realistic doubts. He was too busy fighting the Pelican’s unfamiliar feel. He brought them in low along the Hudson’s leafless black-branched trees of Riverside Park, banking south to follow the Manhattan shore down the West Side Highway.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin watched the signs of destruction grow more apparent with every passing block. Black smoke from an occasional building. An abandoned police car, red lights still flashing, locked inside the endless frozen stream of cars that had given up trying to go north. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">A working ambulance would have no better luck transporting a heart patient.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">An isolated glass-front sliver-building burned. Around garbage and frozen vehicles, groups of people moved northward on foot.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Who could have done a thing like this?</span> Franklin wondered, his thoughts repeatedly interrupted by a horrible image he couldn’t block, a burning fifth-floor apartment ten avenues east, sixty streets to the south. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">What part of this is Cynthia’s?</span></p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer072" class="p_divider1"><span><img alt="" src="image51.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">The 79th Street</span> Boat Basin had been swept into a violent, soupy mess. Listing sloops, catches, yachts aggregated near the shore. A mast here and there poked above the water, their hulls not visible in the murky muck. Among them, thousands of dead striped bass and bluefish floated on their sides. Hundreds of dead green-and-brown-headed mallards.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Where did those come from? </span>Everon wondered.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Must have been a large swell when the bomb went off,” Chuck yelled in his ear.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The sunken boats reminded Everon of the time Cyn had convinced him to fly the two of them out to do some surfing north of San Diego — just after an ocean storm.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Cyn was a fish. She cut through the gigantic waves running seconds apart as if they were hardly there. Fast as Everon paddled, one wave after another slammed him back toward shore, until an especially huge swell towered above his head ready to smash him down. And suddenly Cyn was next to him, laughing, yelling — “Hang on!” — as she reached over and flipped him and his board <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">upside</span> down.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon clung to the surfboard, air in his cheeks, eyes closed, waiting . . . ocean crashing around him . . . for the turbulence to pass. It was terrifying. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Hang on,</span> he told himself . . .</p>
<p class="p_body_para">When he came up, he opened his mouth above the water and sucked in huge gulps of air. And in that moment before the next wave hit them, he heard Cyn’s joyous laughter, saw the beauty of it. His sister’s method worked. Avoid the turbulence completely!</p>
<p class="p_body_para">But Everon turned for shore.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He would never get used to it, never be comfortable with water the way Cyn was. Perhaps some primitive paranoia of drowning would always be there, brought through the ages by the human race. Whatever. He didn’t know.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He did know water was not for him. He found no single thing more frightening. Never again would he attempt to overcome that dull fear. Never again attempt to paddle out beyond the breakers. Even now, flying above it, he could feel the strange pull, that cold water trying to rip the smooth, hard board from his hands — his only means of regaining the surface. No air.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“The Hudson was never all that clean to begin with,” Chuck yelled over Everon’s left shoulder.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">As they flew south, slowly rising, they saw fewer people walking north. Occasionally, in places where the smoke thinned, bodies lay in the street, on the sidewalk.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin looked down through his binoculars. In the cold morning air, limbs had been frozen into odd positions: An arm out straight. A leg bent to one side. Heads at weird angles on necks. Eyes open, eyes closed. Papery, crackly-looking skin; slick, black, pooled blood; hair spiked out like icicles. He wondered, <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Why would someone want to destroy everything — universities, engineers, scientists, inventors, businesses? Who hates us so damned much? “Dear God,”</span> he whispered<span class="c_span_body-char-italic">, “please save our sister. Please bring Cynthia back to us.”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Soon they were south enough to find no one alive at all. When he couldn’t look anymore, Franklin reached back and passed the binoculars to Chuck.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Field glasses against his eyes, Chuck muttered, “Someone’s got to find out whatever <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">bastards </span>did this — some vast and highly secret organization to catch us off guard like this —”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“A bomb can’t leave much evidence!” Everon yelled. “It’s all blown up!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin barely heard Chuck add, “The destruction’s only gonna get worse as we get closer to the center.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin took in the side of Everon’s face, watching as the same thought probably hit them both: <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">How far away from that center was Cynthia when the thing went off?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Look at that!” Chuck handed the binoculars back to Franklin and pointed at the old 72nd Street subway house on Broadway. “Water’s rising!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">A dark wave flowed up through the subway entrances, black, flooding the street.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“The subways must be full,” Chuck added.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“That’s not water!” Franklin yelled back.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon dipped the nose. “What — ?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">As they came closer, the black tide differentiated into thousands of small dark rodent bodies, running for their lives.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Rats! Hundreds of thousands of them!” Everon said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Leaving a sinking ship,” Chuck said. “More than 70 million supposed to live in the city, more rats than people. Way more!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">There were children lying in the streets too. A small boy face down in a jacket in the middle of Broadway, his right hand out above his head reaching for a book. Red with big bright letters. Franklin could make out the title — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Dr. Seuss.</span> Another little girl in her pajamas, maybe ten years old, holding her dead mother’s hand.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">All to be eaten by the rats.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The helicopter bobbled. Franklin watched his older brother at the controls. The beat-up old machine seemed to be running well enough. It was the idea they could be down there too, walking in that human sewage, among the wreckage, flame and smoke. Up to their knees in furry bodies, sharp nips cutting through their jeans —</p>
<p class="p_body_para">But the rat-stampede passed them <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">all</span> by, leaving the dead untouched in their run for the Hudson River. The herd joined up with a second group and flowed up onto the West Side Highway on ramp heading north.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The tips of Franklin’s fingers idled around the pointy triangular base of the very old, small gold cross that hung from a chain inside his shirt. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">People have to be out of their minds to live this way. A loss of reason. </span>And in the next moment it occurred to him who one of those people was.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon looked down at his hands. He was holding the stick in a fiercely unnatural grip. An amateur at the controls. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Can there really be anything left of Cyn’s building? </span>he wondered. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Is Franklin right? Can we find Cyn and Steve and Melissa? Or will the waves of pain and sadness come crashing down on full force? Hell, at least we’re not just waiting, sitting by a phone somewhere until someone calls with the bad news. </span>Some part of him suspected what they really would find. But to know that truth today, they would have to be the ones to find it.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He forced himself to take a long, deep breath . . . another . . . until he could feel the craft again. Then to fly, with grim determination, as fast as the old bird would take them.</p>
