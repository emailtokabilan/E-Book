<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre5">As they rose</span> above ruined streets and broken buildings, the survivors learned in silent fear what the city had become. Franklin wished he could have distracted them from what lay below, keep them from going into a state of shock. There just wasn’t time.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Chuck, can you handle the hoist?” he asked.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Of course.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin stepped to the rear of the Sea Pelican’s cargo area and pulled a climbing harness out of his blue bag.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What are you doing?” Tyner Kone asked, voice rising.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Before we can get you to Teterboro, we have to make a stop,” Franklin said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Stop?</span> You can <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">kiss my ass!”</span> Kone yelled.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Our sister, her husband and child live two blocks over. The first floor was blocked when we tried to get inside their apartment building. We were on our way to get the helicopter to do a flyover when we knocked a piece of concrete down onto your train.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“These people belong in a hospital!” Kone said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Victoria gave the barrel-bodied little bureaucrat a severe look.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Maybe we should just give these men the time they need to do what they came to do. If it weren’t for them we’d still be in that damn train. Probably dead.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I agree,” added Mr. van Patter. He looked toward the empty bench. “This helicopter’s not full, and none of us are in worse shape than this young lady here. If she can wait, I think <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">you</span> can, Mr. Kone. If we can locate any more survivors, we ought to do it.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Yeah, man, just shut up,” said Clarence the newspaper vendor.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The Russians said nothing. The transit engineer gave a small nod of agreement.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Kone shut up.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Victoria sat on the fabric cot-seat looking at him silently. Though her knee was swollen nearly twice its normal size, the pain wasn’t that bad.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">If I hadn’t gone out to the television studio in Queens, I’d probably be dead now. Like David,</span> the guy she’d had a first date with last night. David lived in Chelsea. South. She could see nothing but fire in that direction.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">What if I’d stayed at David’s last night like he wanted me to?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">There was probably still a job here — of some kind. If she wanted it. She didn’t. She didn’t want Atlanta either. So then, <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">back to Chicago</span> it would have to be, she figured.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The helicopter rocked violently as Everon crabbed them over the wrecked building tops.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“That one!” Franklin said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">There on the floor of Cynthia’s apartment was the flower-covered four-drawer file cabinet, situated up against that half-broken bit of outside wall. Again Franklin noticed the fluttering splash of pink along the cabinet’s side.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon dodged them around the roaring yellow ball of flame as it expanded again in the middle of Lexington. “I — I just can’t do it,” he yelled. “I can’t get you over top and still keep the blades out of the fire!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin studied the building through the ball of yellow as they slowly drifted around it. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Something. We aren’t seeing something. Has to be a way down there.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">The flame shrank. Everon inched closer. Expanded again. They could feel the heat from it as it rocked the big Pelican.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">But after two more complete circles, there just wasn’t. Not one debris-covered square foot. To put the winch’s hang point over any part of what was left of the upper floors would put the blades right in the flame.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">At the fireball’s smallest, just as it began to expand, they got a brief look at the apartment floor. The broken walls. Junk littered everywhere.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Fortunately one person wasn’t looking down.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Uh — I think we <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">better GET OUT — OF — HERE!”</span> Clarence shouted. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“SHIT!”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin’s eyes shot upward. Pieces of steel I-beam fell past the blades. Furniture and stone work. A statue of some kind.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“That tower’s coming down!” The helicopter lurched as Everon jerked them away.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Alright, that’s it now!” said Kone.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The city was still falling apart.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin watched through the helicopter window — pieces of someone else’s life falling into the alley behind Cynthia’s building.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">There was no movement down there. No one could have survived.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">With a terrible reluctance, Everon turned off. Banked west.</p>
