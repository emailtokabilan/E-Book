<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre5">“Franklin,” Cynthia coughed.</span> “I thought I was — I didn’t think anyone would —” Tears streamed from the corners of her eyes. Face-to-face inside the cocoon with Franklin’s sister was her husband.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin looked at Steve. Felt his cheek. It was cold. Ice-water cold. He wasn’t breathing. He was gone.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Cynthia laughed bitterly, began to cry, “He went an hour ago,” she coughed, struggled to pull a breath. “My arms . . . I . . . couldn’t move.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">At least I can still save Cynthia,</span> Franklin thought. They were wrapped so tightly, Cynthia’s arms pinned to her sides. “Here, let me get you out of —” he began, unwrapping the blanket —</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Ahhhh!” Cynthia cried, “Don — don’t!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">But Franklin had already peeled it open far enough to see.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">A piece of metal he hadn’t noticed, barely protruding from the outsides of the charred blanket, had pierced them both. The only difference being it had gone through Steve slightly more in the center of his chest. Cynthia’s wound was more to the right side.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I’ve had better nights-out in New York,” Cynthia rasped out with a weak smile. Her attempts to ignore the obvious pain were betrayed by her ragged gasping for air. Her lips were turning blue.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin looked around wildly, up to the helicopter. The black rain was closing fast. By the sound of her breathing, Cynthia’s right lung was punctured. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">How do I get her out of here? How can I get her over the building’s side, down to the street? Without killing her?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Everon must be able to see.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">He waved frantically, trying to will Everon in closer. But the ball of flame expanded, driving the helicopter back. He could just imagine how Kone was responding.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">It looked like Everon was going to try another tack, come around back, inside the block.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Cynthia’s eyes shot to her left. “The cab —” The word died on her lips. Her eyes rolled back in her head. A long gurgling breath poured from her mouth.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“No . . . Cynthia!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin grasped his sister’s head. But he knew that sound too well. He’d heard it from the throats of too many dying Rangers. A death rattle. His sister was gone.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He held his sister’s shoulders in his lap, a hand under Cynthia’s head. He threw up on the dusty floor. He’d found them too late. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">If only I’d gotten here thirty minutes sooner.</span> An hour the subway had cost him. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Another hour at the damn bridge. Would I have been able to save both of them? Did I actually kill Cynthia by unwrapping the blanket, removing the pressure that held her together?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">He let out a long, deep exhale. Tears flowed from his eyes, down his face, onto his chin, his mouth gasping for air.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">His sister and brother-in-law’s naked bodies still clutched each other, holding each other tightly. Cynthia’s blonde, conservative banker’s hair; the short dark hair matted about Steve’s head — he brushed a couple of flies angrily away from Cynthia’s face. But for the blood at the corner of Cynthia’s mouth, in the midst of smoke and fire and the ultimate violence, they were only sleeping.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">She had always quoted one verse to him, a Proverb: <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Above all your possessions, value understanding. </span>Cynthia’s humor had been a door to that understanding. And what she’d always said to understand was that everything — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">every effect</span> — had a cause. That every cause was a value. And <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">values,</span> were completely personal. Cynthia had been one of Franklin’s highest values — besides God — a major cause, a reason for living. And now that link to his family, to their mother and to Everon even, was gone.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">His arms twisted. Like being forced to chew a jalapeño pepper whole while someone used a hammer to break both his arms and legs, unbearable agony coursed through his entire body. Some distant part of him knew the pain in his every cell was purely mental. He didn’t want to think. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">About anything anymore.</span> His altruistic gamble may have saved a bunch of strangers, but it had cost him his sister’s life. There was nothing he could do. No magic formula. No prayer. No take-backs. This was it. Cynthia was gone.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">I have to get them out of here.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">He would lower them to the ground, then himself. Chuck could pick them up there. He looked over the building’s edge. But the street was flooding.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">From the helicopter, Everon watched the low dark tide rushing down the avenue. Flooding into side streets. Reaching Cynthia’s building.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Aren’t there big water supply tunnels under the city?” Chuck asked.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“The water’s gravity-fed,” Walter van Patter answered. “It comes down from the Catskill Mountains. If the tunnels have cracked open, there’s no stopping it.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“We’ll have to leave him!”</span> Kone screamed hysterically.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">WHOOM!</span> The sound of fire imploding echoed, rocking the floor beneath Franklin’s feet. Out in the street, the huge gas ball of fire shrank back again . . . to nothing. The flame was out!</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He squatted there, looking around, shocked by the sudden loss of noise and heat. He blew some air from his nostrils, wiped his eyes.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He looked up at the helicopter, then back to the bodies. He could just imagine what Everon was going to say — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">to think.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon must see him. There was nothing either of them could do now. He quickly cut a piece of rope, tugged the burned edge of the Aztec comforter back into place and began winding the rope around and around them, binding the entire thing like a cocoon.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The black wall, nuclear rain out 60th, was nearly on them. Everon was already bringing the helicopter over.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin hooked the bundle onto the cable and gave Chuck the signal. The cocoon lifted skyward. Franklin looked around to see if he might have missed anything. There was no sign of Melissa. No bassinet, nothing.</p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer148" class="p_divider1"><span><img alt="" src="image109.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">Above his head,</span> Franklin watched Chuck swing the wrapped bodies through the helicopter door. The storm was bearing down on them. Wind blasting in sudden gusts.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">As he waited for Chuck to send the cable back down for him, he noticed a shaking brown mass the shape of a small football by the base of the file cabinet. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">What’s that?</span> he wondered.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">It turned its head.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Some sort of bird,</span> he realized. The exotic brown and white pattern across its feathers fluttered in the strengthening wind. Huge yellow eyes peered up at him as it shivered against the cabinet. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">An owl?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">He reached out to touch it. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Doesn’t seem afraid or aggressive.</span> He scooped a hand underneath, gently lifting it, sliding his wrist against the cabinet.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">And then he heard something — a crying sound.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“The cabinet —”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Pivoting his ears back and forth — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">from inside?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">His eyes locked on the flapping pink material caught in the second drawer. Holding the bird in one hand, he tried to pull it open. To <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">force</span> it open. He tried them all. None of them would budge. The oval-shaped lock was sticking out. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Unlocked position.</span> He lowered his head — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">loudest from the second drawer!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">She’s in here! She’s alive!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">The side of the file cabinet was warm. He could feel the heat right through the glove on his hand. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">The fireball.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Using the hook knife from his harness, he pried into the crack along the drawer’s side — hoping at least to bend the drawer outward far enough to confirm his suspicions. The black edge widened to an eighth of an inch.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Snap!</span> The curved blade broke halfway back.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He looked desperately for some way to get the drawer open. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Dammit! A whole tool kit in the helicopter, a screwdriver, a pry bar —</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Before he realized what was happening, the building’s entire floor suddenly shifted — he felt his thigh and calf muscles react, even before his conscious mind. “Ahhh!” He felt the whole building wobble as if the foundation of life were cracking beneath his feet.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">His first thought was to grab for the cabinet handles, but the floor steadied at a slight angle, maybe five degrees. The foundation rumbled deep somewhere below. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Damn, this thing could go any time! Why am I swearing? Too much time spent around Everon. Starting to affect me.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">He waved frantically for Everon to fly the cable over the cabinet. The dark misty rain looked less than two or three blocks away.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">As Chuck lowered the cable, Franklin quickly unbuttoned the middle of his white shirt and stuffed one of the few living creatures he’d seen today, the owl, inside. He used what was left of the hook knife to cut a piece of rope. He looped the rope through the cabinet’s four drawer handles and tied the ends together.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The wind blasted. The cable hook whacked him on the shoulder.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He snagged it onto the rope. Pulled on the handles to test their strength. They looked like they would hold. He stretched the connecting loop of his own harness to the cable hook. The floor shook violently and with a rumble, as if in slow motion — all he could do to throw both hands around the cable, himself onto the cabinet — the floor fell away.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">And the building collapsed below.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">His arms felt like they were being pulled from their sockets. His body stretched over the top of the cabinet as the lift cable dug through his gloves, into the palms of his hands. He felt a sharp pain beneath his shirt. The owl had latched its talons into his stomach. He moved his knees against the cabinet to keep pressure off the bird. The pain in his midsection eased off.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Overhead blades whipping at his dark hair, the hoist reeled Franklin skyward.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">While the cabinet’s handles might have been strong enough to support the cabinet, they now had to carry his weight as well. He couldn’t get enough grip on the hard stainless cable to pull himself away. The angle, the bird, all combined to make it impossible. But he was rising.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Fifteen feet from the opening in the side of the helicopter, unable to see what was happening below his dangling feet, he felt something sag. With a loud <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">BANG!</span> the bottom handle ripped loose. It felt like the cabinet was going to keep going. But the next lowest drawer handle held — and immediately began to bend.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Oww!”</span> Franklin yelled as the bird dug into his flesh, this time into his ribs. The little owl was getting rambunctious in there, rummaging around under his shirt. He tried to suck in his stomach but it was all he could do to just hang on . . .</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Out the open helicopter side door, Chuck could see what was happening. But the hoist had one speed — slow. Chuck mentally willed it to go faster.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He shouted to Everon, “You’d better find a safe place to get this thing on the ground before that cabinet drops off there. Looks like he’s got it connected by its handles. And they’re tearing out!”</p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer149" class="p_divider1"><span><img alt="" src="image110.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">The wind blew.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Out Everon’s front window, the deadly black rain was closing. Almost near enough to touch. The weight of the swinging cabinet made the helicopter dance despite radical corrections to the controls in Everon’s hands.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“There’s just no good place, Chuck, the way it’s swinging. The wind’s picking up from the east causing turbulence around these buildings. That black rain’s closing in. We can’t go back to the fountain — there’s no other place the blades can fit around here. Isn’t he almost in?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">As the top of the cabinet cleared the helicopter’s floor, Clarence reached out to swing it in — and slipped. Like slow motion, he was falling out the door — twenty degrees past vertical when the transit engineer snagged a grip on his shirt, and yanked him back inside.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Petre the Russian, on the wide door’s other side, reached for Franklin’s harness. Franklin tried to swing a foot around to step inside.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Plunk!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">One side of the second lowest handle — on the drawer he thought she might be inside — chose that moment to rip away.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The rope slipped around it. With a scraping jar, the big metal box slid a foot-and-a-half down against the lower door frame. Now the top two handles carried the load.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">If I could just get my weight off it!</span> He could barely hold onto the rope with one hand. The Russian, Clarence, Chuck and the engineer tried to grab the box’s smooth sides to haul him in.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He could feel the rope slipping beneath his chest, the next handle bending. Every time he pulled himself off the cabinet the owl seemed to dig into his stomach deeper. He ignored the talons and hung off the top of the cable hook using only his biceps.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The hoist wound more cable. It was high enough!</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Chuck, Clarence, the engineer and the Russian moved fast. The third handle snapped, just as they pulled the box through the door. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Bang!</span> — the cabinet fell to the open edge of the helicopter’s metal floor, teetering, twisting on the edge as four pairs of hands struggled to wrestle the tall metal box all the way inside.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“He’s in!” Chuck yelled to Everon, amongst cheering passengers — all but Kone who demanded, “What in hell did you bring that up for?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon stabilized the chopper and climbed gently away from the black mist. They were getting short on fuel. He tapped the oil gauge. It didn’t look like the leak was getting any better either.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Victoria was closest. She leaned her head on the warm cabinet. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“I hear crying!”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What?” Kone yelled.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Crying! Inside! Here!” she said, pointing at the second drawer from the bottom.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“The second drawer!” Clarence said, “She’s right!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Da!” echoed the Russian woman Kat, her head next to Victoria’s.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin was already jumping for tools from the helicopter’s rear wall. Flipping open the toolbox lid, ignoring a hammer, screwdrivers and wrenches, near the bottom he found a two-foot pry bar.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He dropped an ear against the cabinet’s side. To his relief, despite the helicopter blades and engines, he could still hear that crying sound. He put the bar’s edge into the narrow gap along the right side and pushed. The metal side bent outward, creating a small triangular gap. He pulled on the drawer. It still wouldn’t slide open.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He put one eye to the opening. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Can’t see!</span> he thought furiously.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He wedged the bar into the slit along the drawer’s top. Its horizontal divider bent as much as the drawer itself, then with a sudden <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">clanggg! — </span>popped outward.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Chuck, Walter van Patter, Victoria, Clarence, the Russians, the transit engineer, even Kone, jockeyed to see as Franklin struggled to scrape out the damaged drawer, screeching metal-against-metal audible above the helicopter’s noise.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Between the fourth and fifth buttons on Franklin’s white button-down shirt, a fluffy brown and white speckled head poked its way out to join the curious.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">And there she was, wrapped in a pink blanket, nestled between a few hanging file folders, face-to- face with the exotically colored bird, crying with all the gusto she could manage — Franklin and Everon’s baby niece, Melissa.</p>
