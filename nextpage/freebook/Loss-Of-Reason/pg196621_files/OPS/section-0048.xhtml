<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre5">The Sudden</span><span class="calibre15"> CLUNK</span> made the entire fuselage vibrate.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Aux power unit?” Everon grunted, more surprised question than answer.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">A moment later several scattered dim lights blinked on across the control panel. Franklin could make out Everon’s hands in a death grip, fighting the white yoke.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He twisted the yoke hard right, and Franklin felt his head roll to his left shoulder, his body sway — as his brother’s right hand shot out to punch buttons, flip levers on the panel.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Another soft noise joined the whistling wind. A whining, behind and to the right. Everon flipped more switches. A similar noise grew from the left. “Go . . .” he urged, <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“GO!”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">The whine grew louder, and in the moment Franklin recognized it for what it was, two things happened, more wonderful than he could imagine. Dim lights came on around the cockpit, then back through the cockpit door in the cabin. And the windshield went from pure black to being splattered with bright points of light.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Stars. Overhead there were stars!</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The wind-sound dropped away. A dim cloud-filled horizon righted below them. The turbulence dissipated. Franklin felt pressure from the seat on the backs of his legs, the weight of Melissa in his arms. They were on top of an ocean of moonlit cotton, flying between mountains of white.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He leaned forward, looked back through the right side cockpit window. There was no black gunk on the wing. It was gone. The wing was clean. He found the radiation meter wedged behind his seat and moved its probe around the ceiling . . . the walls, the windshield.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“How is it, Bro?” Everon asked.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“A trace. That’s all.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“You know what that was,” Everon said, not really a question.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin waited, gently jiggling Melissa to calm her crying.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“There’s only one answer. Another bomb. Had to be. I wonder where. Close enough to affect us, not close enough to do permanent damage.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin floated between worry, sadness, anger. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“How is</span> <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">this happening?”</span> he asked softly. Louder, “Is the plane okay?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I don’t know. The few systems I’m using appear functional. We’ll find out about the rest when we get to the Valley.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin watched the plane’s lights play over Everon’s tired blond features. Hours without sleep. Hopefully the autopilot was still working and could do most of the flying.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin’s eyes dropped to Melissa. He smoothed a hand over her dark hair much like his own, soothing her, then looked to the aisle where Harry sat shaking softly on the floor and scooped the owl back into his soup box. A feather molted from his right wing into the bottom.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Someone was sobbing in the back of the jet. More than one.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Okay to go back there?” he asked Everon.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Go ahead. We should remain stable for now but don’t be too long out of your seat.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He unlatched his seat belt, stepped around Harry’s box, carrying Melissa.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The passengers were pretty shaken up. Severe strap burns across necks. Deeply bruised stomachs. Somehow there were no obvious broken bones.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He knelt along the seats, stopped and talked to each person, letting his voice drop down like a salve, at first mirroring their nervous discomfort then bringing them each down out of the shock they were feeling.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_er-char-italic">“YOU YOU OKAY?”</span> he suggested.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I — I think so.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He nodded and moved on.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Is the plane okay?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“We think it is. <span class="c_span_er-char-italic">YOU’RE ALRIGHT?</span> Beginning to . . . <span class="c_span_er-char-italic">FEEL EASIER, NOW?”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Soothing the adults, pacifying the children. Tranquilizing the fast-beating heart. Some, a few moments. Others, longer until they were calm.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Back past the pantry, through the now-open door to the luggage compartment, tied to the floor was the black body bag. He moved closer, knelt down. He wished he could just unzip it and say, <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Cynthia! Wake up!”</span> like she’d done for him so many birthdays and Christmases ago. He thought of the charred Aztec blanket inside, wrapped around Cynthia and Steve’s bodies. Holding each other, clinging in their final moment.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He gulped down a swallow of air, holding Melissa just a little tighter. He stood and closed the luggage door. He didn’t want to say the words he would have to, to Everon. It wasn’t going to be a very pleasant ride back to Nevada.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">was</span> that?” Someone asked as he moved back to the front.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“We don’t know,” Franklin answered softly, moving forward.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“It had to be a second bomb,” one of the men behind him said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Where do you think it went off?” a woman’s voice called out. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Boston? Washington?</span> No point sending another one to New York.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">She was answered only by the whine of the engines.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin put his seat belt on.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“This better not be like all the other things the government never figured out,” Everon spit out. “But how can they? Unless someone comes right out and takes credit for it.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I hope Chuck’s okay,” Franklin began, dodging the inevitable.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“At least he’s inside the hospital. Higher ground,” Everon answered absently, adjusting one of the jet’s controls.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin remembered Cynthia’s face. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">When</span> <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">she —</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">He looked at his brother. “Uh —” He felt the pain and anger rise up in his chest, behind his eyes, flowing out to his wrists, his fingertips. “Cynthia was alive when I got to her.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“What!”</span> almost a scream from Everon. “Wasn’t there anything —”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I tried,” he whispered.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Couldn’t you —”</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Jesus Christ!”</span> Franklin said, shocking himself. Never in the last six years had he taken the Lord’s name in vain. “She gave out a death rattle!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon stared miserably out the jet’s front window.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“She told me Steve died an hour before.” Franklin felt tears well up. “Her last words were <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">‘I’ve had better nights-out</span> <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">in New York.’</span> Then, <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">‘The cabinet . . .’</span> That and spotting Harry shaking next to it were how I found Melissa.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He waited for Everon to scream something else, about the time lost in the subway. The extra time they’d taken on the bridge.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">But it didn’t come.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">For the rest of his life these things would probably come back as though he’d lived three days in one: Helping pull Victoria Hill, Walter van Patter, Kone and the others from the collapsed subway. Freeing the thousands trapped on the upper deck of the George Washington Bridge. Finally, Cynthia dying in his arms and finding Melissa.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">It was a day he hoped never to live again.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Unfortunately his desires would not dictate his future. Today, he would come to realize, was only the beginning of the pain to be borne by himself and many others. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Who,</span> Franklin wondered, <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">could have done this to us?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Steve —” Everon finally said. “I always liked him.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Then there was only silence but for the whisper of the engines as they headed west.</p>
