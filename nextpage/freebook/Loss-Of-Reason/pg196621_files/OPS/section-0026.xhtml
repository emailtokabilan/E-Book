<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre5">Everon and the </span>Russian pulled the transit engineer from the hole. The portly guy, Kone, was in the second harness, already riding the winch to the street. The old man would go up next, the engineer after him.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon glanced at the hole alongside the train. “What’s taking so long?” he asked. “How many more are there?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“The rescue guy’s the last,” the transit engineer answered.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The hole suddenly filled with water.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Down below, Franklin reached up blindly for anything. There was nothing to grab onto. He couldn’t breathe.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He reached again and felt fingers take hold of his right hand — then slip away. He was being sucked down, deeper now, backward into the train.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Something caught the left sleeve of his leather jacket. It was a grip of iron and it shocked him to know who it had to be, to know the water had to be not only over his own head but over his brother’s too — startled to remember what Cynthia once told him, how frightened Everon was of having his head submerged.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He slid his other hand onto the hand that pinched his leather sleeve. Another hand reached down attaching itself to his arm. Slowly, he moved upward. But the suction tried to hold him. He was drowning, running out of air.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He was jerked forward — violently!</p>
<p class="p_body_para">His head burst clear. He saw Everon’s determined face, eyes big, covered with wet gray slime. They both gasped, sucking in huge gulps of the smoky Manhattan air.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The Russian, kneeling down next to Everon, must have been holding Everon’s legs for he scrambled forward and pulled at Franklin’s arms too, helping Franklin crawl his own legs out of the sucking muck.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin’s feet came free and he made his knees, breathing hard. He rose to one foot, bent over, his muddy sleeve taking a swipe across his face, then hugged his brother. “Thanks — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Bro!” </span>he breathed out.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon let out a long exhale. “Nothing better to do today.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Except find Cynthia.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Exactly.”</p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer111" class="p_divider1"><span><img alt="" src="image82.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">Standing in toe-deep</span> water as it rippled over the train car top, Franklin and Everon watched the rope help the Russian rise to the street. The others were already up.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Climbing out from here would have been impossible for them without the hoist.” Franklin looked up. “Nice job getting rid of the metal grate.” He turned to Everon. “We can’t just ditch them, you know.” Rising water sloshed over their boot tops.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I know.” Everon’s forehead held a puzzled frown. “That old guy looks familiar.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Victoria — the dark-haired girl — she called him Mr. van Patter.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Walter</span> van Patter? What the hell? You’re kidding!” Everon nodded. “I thought I’d seen him somewhere. That guy’s a multibillionaire, Bro. They call him The Runner.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“The Runner? <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Him?”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Well, he doesn’t actually run much. It’s a nickname. Did you see those gold and white running shoes he wears? He walks everywhere. Probably the only billionaire in the city who never uses a driver.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The harness was coming down. “How long to get the helicopter started?” Franklin asked.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Just a few minutes, I hope.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin held the harness out to his brother. “Then get up there and get going.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon got his legs in the straps and yelled up. A moment later he began ascending the tunnel wall very slowly. “Looks like the battery’s nearly out of juice . . .”</p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer112" class="p_divider1"><span><img alt="" src="image83.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">Chuck was handing</span> each person a bottle of water and a snack bar as they reached the street. He pulled out a blanket for Victoria to sit on.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Dislocated,” he said. “Nice job somebody came up with for splints,” carefully undoing them. “Franklin?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I did it.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Really!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">When he probed her bulging knee with a gentle fingertip, she barely reacted. “Not bothering you like you’d think it would,” he said puzzled, rubbing backs of fingers across red muttonchops. “I can’t reduce it by myself though.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The Russian woman said something unintelligible and knelt down behind Victoria’s head. She slid her arms to the elbows under Victoria’s armpits and said something else to Chuck.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Do it!” said the Russian man.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“She wants you to try to put it back in,” Victoria said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Yeah. Okay,” Chuck pushed her skirt up a few inches, and with a meaty hand massaged her thigh, pulling on her heel, straightening her leg.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Now the pain came back. Her leg was three-quarters straight when her kneecap popped over and her leg straightened. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Ahhhh . . .”</span> Suddenly the world felt a whole lot better.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Chuck replaced the newspaper splints with a clear blow-up plastic cuff. He wound another cloth around her head.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“You should check out Mr. van Patter,” she said, as the white-haired man came from the ditch. “I think he had a pretty bad crack.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Chuck used some alcohol on a gauze pad to clean the blood off the side of van Patter’s forehead.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“No big deal,” the old guy winced.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Chuck peeled open a large flesh-colored adhesive bandage and applied it just below the scalp line. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Probably a concussion,</span> Chuck thought.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Who are they?” Victoria asked. “The two guys who got us out of there.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Who, Franklin and the blond one?” Chuck smiled. “Just met ’em myself. They’re brothers.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Brothers?” van Patter said. “They don’t look anything like brothers.”</p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer113" class="p_divider4"><span><img alt="" src="image84.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">As the hoist</span> walked Everon slowly upward, he wiped sweat from his eyes, more of the gray cement mud from his forehead. The sun was out. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Getting warm. Or is it that gas blasting up out of the street?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">As soon as he made the edge, he immediately got out of the harness and signaled the train engineer to send it back down for Franklin.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The smell seemed worse than before. Everon looked down 59th. “The military’s been here? HAZMAT people?” he asked, frowning.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Chuck shook his head, “Not yet.” The others agreed. A low hum permeated the air.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Those body bags,” Everon pointed out two, a hundred feet up the sidewalk.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The Russian woman watched where he was pointing. She began speaking rapidly, hands suddenly animated. Her agitation spread to the Russian male.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What are they saying?” Kone asked.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I don’t know. You can ask Franklin when he gets up here,” Everon said. “Something about body bags. I’ve got to —”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Look kinda rough,” Clarence frowned at the two nearest ones. “Uneven, somehow, aren’t they?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Oh my God!”</span> Victoria said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“That’s no rubberized plastic,” Chuck snarled. “Flies. Thousands of ’em.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Shit!” Everon said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">hate</span> flies,” Chuck said. “Nothing — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">nothing</span> will ever kill all the flies and roaches in New York City.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Why can’t the big guy just shut up?</span> Everon thought. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Rats, pigeons, cockroaches, he’s okay with. Flies, he has a problem —</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">The train engineer flipped the lever to put the hoist in gear. Everon watched the hoist grinding Franklin upward. Wind gusted along the street. Buildings blocked any sense of direction. Everon could see some blue sky, a puffy cumulus overhead. “As soon as my brother’s up I’m going to run ahead, start the helicopter . . .”</p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer114" class="p_divider5"><span><img alt="" src="image85.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">Franklin was only</span> up six feet when the hoist <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">rrrrr-ed</span> to a stop. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Not my day!”</span> The cable rope slowly paid out and set him back in the shin-high water . . .</p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer115" class="p_divider1"><span><img alt="" src="image86.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">“Pull him up!”</span> van Patter urged. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Pull him up!”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everyone but Victoria, van Patter and Kone grabbed onto the winch cable. Too slick and smooth. There was nothing to grip.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I’ll get another battery!” Everon yelled, grabbing the drill and heading for the nearest abandoned car.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon had the hood raised and was disconnecting the battery’s second lead, when a shout went up. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“There!”</span> Franklin’s head appeared at the top of the rope, tied around Bloomingdale’s front doors. Bent over, straining, he rose out of the ditch hand-over-hand.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin’s climbing shoes had no laces.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Ahh,” Everon smiled, running back. “The old pull yourself up by your shoelaces trick!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin’s laces were wound around the rope, ends tied in knots to form loops. Slide one up. Stand on the other. He pulled himself over the street’s edge — to the waiting grip of Clarence, the Russian guy and the train engineer.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Faster than changing batteries,” he said as he undid the knots and threaded the laces back in his shoes. He looked at Everon. “Haven’t you got a helicopter to start?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Right!” Everon scooped up the hoist, tugged on Clarence’s jacket. “Come on! Give me a hand!” And they ran down 59th Street.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Victoria looked at Franklin’s pants, jacket — his face and dark hair were caked with gray mud. “What <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">happened?”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">“New York’s streets are underlain with dozens of creeks and streams,” the voice of white-haired van Patter answered for him. “But I wouldn’t doubt the water coming into the train is part of the East River.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin glanced back over the edge, rapidly coiling purple rope around a hand and elbow. The rubble above the train was completely submerged now.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I didn’t pay to get on. Maybe the Transit Authority didn’t want to let me go.”</p>
