<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre5">The mob of</span> GW Bridge survivors was halfway to Teterboro when drops of black goo began to fall from the sky. Fifty-one people squeezed in together atop a narrow raised concrete oval that housed the pumps of a Quick-N-Go GAS U-POURIUM.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">On the platform’s front side, barely protected by the station’s overhang, the woman who’d hit Franklin with her keys struggled to keep her weight off her bloody right leg without being pushed off the pump platform into the growing black muck. Bonnie Fisk’s torn pants did not protect her from the goo’s backsplash, each cold ricocheted drop a little bit of fire.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The wind picked up, and where small globs of the black stuff splattered, bare skin turned red and began to burn. They tried to rub it off. Blisters formed. They screamed and cursed and packed in tighter. It was like being jammed into the bridge all over again. The cloud pushed west.</p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer168" class="p_divider5"><span><img alt="" src="image123.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">Franklin’s survivors hurried</span> past the medical tents to where long yellow school buses were filling with people. A shake of Franklin’s hand, a pat on his back. “Thank you,” they said quickly. “The pilot — he leave so fast,” Petre said in Russian, “You thank him for us?” then, “Do svidaniya,” — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Goodbye,</span> echoed Kat. Kone continued into the lot without a word.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">An old white sedan with several people inside pulled up sharply. A young guy in a long heavy coat rushed from the driver’s side. Victoria smiled at him as he moved behind her chair.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Head out the window, Kone returned in the back of a black town car bearing U.S. government plates. Asked if he could offer Walter van Patter a lift. “No thank you, Mr. Kone,” van Patter declined. Kone’s jaw bulged and he told the driver to move on.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Clarence, the train engineer, the Russians, even Mr. van Patter, found seats on one of the yellow buses.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">As Victoria’s friend began to push her chair away, she reached up, pulled Franklin’s shoulder down and kissed his cheek. “You did a wonderful thing for us. Thank your brother for me, will you?” She studied his face, “You’re really a minister?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“First Congregational Church, Erie, Pennsylvania,” Franklin replied, feeling strangely warm around the collar.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“You and the pilot —” she said. “Your hair’s so dark. He’s so blond. You don’t look much like brothers.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“We each share — a parent with Cynthia . . .” A lump formed in his throat. He looked down at Melissa in his arms, his niece’s accusing eyes staring up at him. “We’re both her uncles,” he rasped.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The guy from the car rolled her to the rear side door, helped her from the wheelchair into the back seat. She looked back through the rear window as they drove away.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Harry — as Victoria had named him — was shaking inside Franklin’s shirt. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">I have to do something about this bird.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Someone had left a cardboard box on the ground. Campbell’s Chicken Soup. Inside was a stack of thin <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">USA TODAYs</span>. The headline read:</p>
<p class="p_usa-today-article-title"><span class="calibre11">WHO’S RESPONSIBLE?</span></p>
<p class="p_s_graphic_after">A computer-drawn image took up the whole first page. In his mind’s eye he saw what no eye should ever see: an expanding fireball, bright and red and gold and lethal in all its evil glory. The blast was centered at Manhattan’s south end — below <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Wall Street,</span> labeled: <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">South Street Seaport.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Balancing Melissa, Franklin slipped his free hand along the stack and set half the papers on the ground. He tugged out his front shirttails. Down inside his shirt, the owl’s talons clung to the top of Franklin’s pants. Harry didn’t want to leave, the owl’s speckled brown feathers shaking, shivering, all the way down the bird’s fluffy white chest, his long feathery cape.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin sucked in his abs and gently prised beneath the bird’s talons with a finger, coaxing the owl into letting go. Finally, Harry released his grip and Franklin lifted him out of his shirt. Set him in the box.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The owl kept his large yellow eyes focused on Franklin as he scooped up the box in one arm, Melissa in the other. As Franklin hustled for the jet, spots of blood weeping across his shirtfront, Harry began a soft <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“hup-hup-hup.”</span></p>
