<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre5">Gasping for breath </span>Franklin fell through the jet’s door. “I think the military’s after me!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Wha — why?”</span> Andréa asked.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I took a radioactive sample off one of their helicopters.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Are you nuts?”</span> she shook her head. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Both of you!”</span> exasperated. “We better get going.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I found a family who wanted a ride. Where —” Franklin looked into the jet’s empty passenger area. Everon, Hunt, even the black body bag, were gone.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“You’re taking Mr. Williams’ Gulfstream home,” Andréa explained. “And you’re taking a bunch of refugees out west with you.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin hurried Cynthia’s papers into the soup box next to Harry. Gently shoving the bird aside, he squeezed in the radiation counter. Put the sample in the corner farthest from Harry.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Andréa carried Melissa; Franklin, Harry’s box. When Andréa got more than a couple feet ahead of Franklin, Melissa and the owl began to let out cries and howls. They really didn’t like being separated.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Andréa led Franklin to a long white aircraft at the end of the row. He could see Everon through the cockpit window talking rapidly with a tall, thin man dressed in airline whites.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">A young Hispanic woman lurched after her small son out the jet’s open door. A pear-shaped old woman with white hair and a bald old man followed. They bent over heaving red and green bile. The little boy and his mother went to their knees.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The old woman stopped first and put a hand on the young woman’s back, looked up at Franklin. “I’m afraid,” she coughed, “you’ll have to go without us. They were <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">snowed</span> on. Got us too.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Snow? Did it snow?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“That gray stuff. They had it all over their shoes. We think the kid ate some,” she coughed. “On the way here, over in Queens —” gulping as if she was about to let loose again, “— we got hit with that stinging black crap out of the sky.” Her teary eyes turned to the short bald man next to her. “Let’s get Cheri and Johnny to a hospital tent, Louie.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin shook his head as they staggered away.</p>
<p class="p_bible-verse">“And behold,” he mumbled, “a pale green horse: and Hell and pestilence followed with him. And the names of they that sat on them was Death.”</p>
<p class="p_s_graphic_after">He turned suddenly to Melissa. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Will she get sick too? </span>She’d been outside in that cabinet all night long.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">A hint of wind from the city forced its way between the jets. Franklin looked up. The black mist was right <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">THERE!</span> Maybe a mile away. Coming in fast.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">A man and woman ran up, pulling a little boy and girl by their hands. “Is this the plane going to Nevada?” the man asked.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Uh, yes it is.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin followed them aboard as Everon glanced at him and said to the man in airline whites, “Here’s my co-pilot now.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">It looked like word had gotten around. People squooshed over to make room to let the little family of newcomers buckle in. The whole back of the plane was full. To the stares of several passengers, Franklin set Harry’s soup box on the floor, hurried past leather seats filled with refugees.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Back in cargo he stepped around the fat rubber body bag. It was strapped to the floor with some of his climbing rope. There was a small plastic window on top — like something that would hold a shipping label.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The words read: Certificate Of Death.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">That sense of directionless rage welled up in him again — unlike anything he’d ever felt — the urge to strike at anything. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Not anymore! I’m a minister, for Christ’s sake!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin found an empty upper compartment and shoved the scarf-wrapped bottle inside. When he got back up front, he took Melissa from Andréa then leaned into the cockpit between Everon and the man in airline whites.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“We’ve swapped jets,” Everon said. “I’ve agreed to help Hunt fix — where were you?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I was getting Cynthia’s papers. We’ve got to get off the East Coast!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Did you see that wind? It’s almost too late to leave. I don’t know if we should be in the air when the next — whatever’s coming hits. If —”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“It may be too dangerous to stay! Three Army helicopters just landed back from Manhattan. They came back radioactive. They had to have been in the fallout zone.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Maybe that’s why the military wouldn’t let us south of —”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin pointed. “There’s another reason we’d better get out of here.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">A horde of people were coming down the road, like all Manhattan was on its way. Poorly dressed homeless people alongside Wall Street types, others in bathrobes.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“We may have shot ourselves in the foot, Bro,” Everon nodded, “opening that bridge.” He looked to the man in airline whites.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The man grabbed his flight bag and left the co-pilot’s seat. “We’re all set. Mr. Williams wants a quick word.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Once the Williams man was out, Franklin frowned and asked, “This thing’s pretty big. It only takes one pilot to fly it?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Shhhh! </span>It’s not usually legal,” Everon whispered, “but all standard FAA regulations are temporarily suspended. All flights are subject to military approval under martial law. In other words, it all depends on whether we can get clearance. I can handle it just fine myself — as long as nothing breaks and things don’t get too crazy.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin and Melissa followed Everon off the plane.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“One thing —” Hunt began.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon looked at his own right shoulder. A dime-sized drop of something dark and thick and wet had fallen on his jacket collar. He glanced at the sky. Moved a finger to touch the stuff.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Don’t!” Franklin said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The middle of the heavy black cloud was right over their heads.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin leaned into the jet, pulled Chuck’s meter out of Harry’s box. Turned it on. Waved it around Everon’s collar.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Radioactive!”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon jerked off his jacket, threw it to the ground. “Let’s get out of here!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The daylight dimmed. A blast of wind came through, gusting violently, then died.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“One thing —” Hunt rushed as Everon stepped through the big jet’s doorway.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“What?”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Please. No <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">barrel rolls</span> in the Gulfstream.”</p>
<div class="calibre1">

</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">“Second, our job</span> is to control debris!” Colonel Marsh explained. “What search quadrant were you flying?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Seventy-second street. West side. Uh, sir, it’s getting pretty damned hot, even up there.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Mueller’s just yellow!” a second pilot spat through clenched teeth.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Sir,” the first pilot shot back, “it’s raining atomic fallout over there! If we fly another mission we’re in danger of being poisoned. We absorbed more that last flight through the chopper’s skin than all our other missions combined!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“No reason we can’t wear radiation suits,” the second pilot shot back.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“How are we supposed <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">to fly</span> in a rad-suit, sir?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">General Anders roared up in an old staff car, one of the few still working. Shaven head, long military coat with sheepskin collar. He flew from the back seat.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Report, Colonel.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Marsh began explaining the progress with the tents, power and hospital facilities. The radiation picked up by the last three helicopters he’d sent in.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Perhaps we ought to relocate our hospital facilities back some,” Anders agreed.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Colonel!” The third pilot blurted as he ran up out of breath. “Unauthorized personnel snooping around our helicopters!” He swallowed and before Marsh could respond, added, “Uh — with what looked like a radiation counter!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“We cannot have civilians taking radiation readings off our helicopters!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Uh, excuse me, Colonel Marsh, General.” A sergeant had been standing by, leaning foot to foot like he had to go to the bathroom. Anders’ and Marsh’s eyes shot to him. “I — I’m not sure,” he said hesitantly, “I think I saw him too. He scooped some dirt off the landing gear of one chopper into a water bottle —”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What!” Anders yelled. “We can’t have that! Arrest him!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Yes sir. He disappeared somewhere into the row of jets here. I spoke to the same guy earlier this morning. He said he came on a Williams jet.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Describe him.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Long dark hair. Leather jacket. Blue eyes.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Well, search every single aircraft if you have to. Start on this end and work your way back.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“There’s a big Williams Gulfstream up a little ways,” one of Marsh’s men said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“That minister at the gate this morning, Sarge?” another man put in.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“You seen him?” the sergeant barked.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“He just got into that small Lear up at the beginning of the row. The one with <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Williams</span> painted on it. I went past a minute ago and the door was closed. I think it’s leaving for the runway right now.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Anders turned to Marsh. “I want three men.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Sergeant Rodriquez,” Marsh commanded, “you, Bell and Zimmer follow the general’s staff car . . .”</p>

</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">Holding Melissa in</span> his lap, Franklin looked back through the cockpit door at the people traveling with them. Fourteen children and adults were belted to the white leather seats. There was a sense they were consciously avoiding the luggage door that shielded the wide black rubber bag — the way the parents had placed their kids away from the aisle.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The owl was shaking.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">A single worry pushed the rest away: <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">This owl looks pretty sick — that young woman, her little boy, the two old people who brought them too. Will Melissa be next?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">He watched the jet two ahead turn onto the runway and accelerate to takeoff speed. Two old green staff cars with large stars on their doors sped down the opposite taxiway.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What’re <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">they</span> doing?” Everon said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The cars crossed the runway and stopped abruptly at Hunt’s smaller Lear, two jets back. Soldiers jumped from the cars. One banged on the Learjet’s door.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“That’s General Anders. And that security guard Vandersommen is with him!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“They think we’re in there,” Everon said. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Whoa!” </span>Bushes whipped around outside, then bent over. Just as suddenly, all was still.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I — I think they might actually be looking for me,” Franklin said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Globs of black pelted across the jet’s windshield. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Big sloppy chunks.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin leaned forward to see back through the cockpit window. It was falling all over the wings.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Will the jet take off with that stuff on it?” he asked. “I remember you saying even a little snow can really cut a plane’s lift. That stuff looks a lot heavier than a little snow.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Unless it slides off. It increases the required runway length. A bunch. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">And</span> we’re fully loaded.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin grabbed Chuck’s meter. He extended its probe. Waved it around the cockpit’s ceiling and walls. “It’s radioactive! The windshield’s off the scale! What do we do?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Without waiting for a change in clearance, Everon made an illegal turn onto a runway access closer than the one assigned, braked the big jet and keyed his mic.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Gulfstream — Five-Five-Six-Six-Sierra-Whiskey to Teterboro tower. Ready to depart Runway Two-Four.”</p>

</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">For many, many</span> miles the second fish had been swimming patiently beneath the water’s surface. Nowhere near its planned destination, its nose hammered directly into shore. To the fish’s small but potent brain, the impact made one thing clear:</p>
<p class="p_body_para">It had arrived.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Eight shakes of a second later it became nothing more than a ball of pure expanding energy.</p>
