<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre8">There’s another one! </span>Sal thought . . . <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">And another one . . .</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Along the highway berm were stranded cars with no apparent damage.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“I think they’re running out of gas!”</span> he said softly.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“How are <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">we,</span> Saly?” Margarete asked. “Will we make it to Momma’s?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Sal glanced at the Chevy’s gauges. “Eighth of a tank,” he muttered. “I don’t know.” They were up to forty.<span class="c_span_body-char-italic"> At least we’re moving again. Another hour should do it.</span> Margarete dialed in a local radio station.</p>
<p class="p_radio_">“Evacuees who try to return before their home areas are officially open are being blocked by military personnel; they will be required to turn their vehicles around. Those not yet allowed to go home may have to spend another grueling night in their cars.”</p>
<p class="p_s_graphic_after">“What’s an evacee, Daddy?” their son asked.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Listen!” Margarete shushed. The station’s voice continued:</p>
<p class="p_radio_">“Traffic is still extreme. Apparently some drivers unable to take the stress have flatly refused to move. The Army is using giant transport trucks to shove any such cars aside.</p>
<p class="p_radio_1">“Soldiers were forced to return fire on one man with a handgun who died after receiving two bullets to the head —”</p>
<p class="p_s_graphic_after">Sal turned it off. “Those poor bastards.” Not even a glare from Margarete. “We’re lucky we got out when we did.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“When are they going to figure out who’s behind this, Saly?” Rita asked, echoing the very thing he’d been thinking. She had a way of doing that.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">As they came off the freeway the engine quit for a moment, then restarted. Sal ran a red light. When they turned onto Momma Conti’s street the engine stopped running completely.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">They coasted into the driveway.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Their arrival was a complete surprise to Momma Conti.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Oh, my children,” Daniella exclaimed as she opened the door. It was the first time Sal had ever heard such desperation in his mother-in-law’s voice. Almost as if she included him in her affection.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Oh, darling,” Margarete’s mother gushed all over her daughter. “And you drove <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">that car!”</span> An eyeball glanced at Sal. “I’m so relieved to see you. The news said there are no airlines, no trains at all east of Buffalo. And my two little pumpkins!” she knelt down, arms reaching out to hug the kids. “I’m so glad we’re all together.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Hello, Daniella.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Hello, Sal.” She turned back to Margarete.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“There was no way to call you!” Margarete said. “When the sirens started and the power went off — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">we hadn’t planned</span> — we barely had any food. We packed everything we had.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Don’t worry,” Daniella said to her daughter, Sal thought eyeing him a bit snidely. “Momma has no electricity at the moment. But <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">our</span> food’s still cold. Plenty for <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">everybody.”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Margarete kissed her mother’s cheek and turned to the kids. “Time for you two to have a quick bite and get to bed.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">But the moment the kids were down, the power came on. For how long, Sal couldn’t say. “They’re transmitting from New York!” Daniella called.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The first thing Sal saw on his mother-in-law’s television was a man with an owl’s head sticking out of his shirt.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“That bird!”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Sal ran out of the room like a nut — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Who cares! Daniella already thinks so anyway</span> — to the room the kids were using, silently slid out the yellow toolbox by its black handle. Flipped up the lid, pawing through, dumping his daughter’s dolls onto the floor —</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">There!</span> Narrow brown stripes painted in streaks across its entire length . . .</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Rita and her mother, staring at him as he ran back in. He held the feather to the television screen.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">It’s the same!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">He could still picture the restaurant’s dock. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">That Middle Eastern man with the boat. Letting go of that bird beneath the Brooklyn Bridge.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">And then the picture was suddenly replaced by snow, the sound by static.</p>
