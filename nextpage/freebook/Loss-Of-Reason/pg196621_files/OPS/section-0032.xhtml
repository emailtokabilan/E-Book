<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre5">As Franklin was</span> hoisted back up to the Sea Pelican, his eyes studied the bridge’s structure, followed the lines of its blue-gray girders, the way they connected. Something he could almost see nagged at him, and faded. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Something</span> —</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Suddenly, in his mind he saw another structure, as it last lay. His brain had snapped a picture at the last possible moment, an image he didn’t know he had. If it was still like that when they got — He wouldn’t be able to take anything down with him. Did he dare?</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Chuck and the Russian Petre swung him through the cargo door.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“We have to go back!” he yelled.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“About time!” said Kone. “We ought to just make it.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“No,” said Franklin. “Back to Cynthia’s. I know how to get on top!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“WHAT!”</span> screamed Kone.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“We’ve already tried twice!” Everon yelled. “Bro,” he head pointed, “Look! See that dark stuff out there not making it to the ground? That’s virga. It could turn to full-on radioactive rainstorm in an instant. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">She’s gone! </span>All that’s left to us is to figure out who did it. Vengeance is all we have left and even that’s extremely unlikely. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">They’re gone!</span> Let them go!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“They’re not!</span> Trust me,” Franklin said fiercely. “I know how to get in. Let me try!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon shook his head, lips tight. “This bird’s barely in the air.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“You can fly anything.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon studied the severe, begging intensity in his younger brother’s face. Franklin shouted over the whining engine, “If you don’t go back, it’s not that I won’t forgive you — you’ll never forgive yourself!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon’s hand left the stick for only a second. To wipe across his eyes.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“You’ve got to get these people to a hospital first!” Kone yelled.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“If we land, they won’t let us take off again,” Franklin shouted back.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What about radiation?” Kone pointed out the Pelican’s east windows. “That cloud doesn’t look any farther away.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin didn’t answer. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">It’s not. It’s closer.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Let them have one more try,” said van Patter.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“You owe your life to these men, Mr. Kone!” It was Victoria and she pointed a finger at Franklin while looking at the little bureaucrat. “He nearly drowned getting us out! And now you say they can’t take every chance, any possibility to find their family?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin looked at her gratefully. “I didn’t know you knew about that.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“The engineer told me,” her voice rising to reach Everon. “Put us down somewhere on the Manhattan shore.” She pointed at Kone, “Let him walk back!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Kone yelled. He screamed. He went for the cockpit. At one point Franklin thought he was going to try to wrestle the controls out of Everon’s hands.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">But with the support of Victoria, of Walter van Patter, the others physically restraining Kone who refused to agree to get out, Everon turned back into Manhattan. They were going back into it. Back toward the cloud.</p>

<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">Bits of ash</span> clung to the Impala’s old white body. Edie’s left hand gripped Lou’s right thigh as she rode next to him in front — while Cheri Enriquez, their new neighbor, tried to comfort her son Johnny in the back.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Kid looks pretty sick,</span> thought Lou Goodman. Another quick look in the rearview mirror. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">And his mother isn’t looking much better.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">The Goodmans were an old Jewish couple in their seventies, Lou balding, his wife Edith’s hair whiter than the Brooklyn snow from the bomb. They had planned to take the girl and her kid to their son’s house in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Lou and Edie’s grandkids had moved away to Vegas. Jake and his wife were out there visiting. The apartment was empty.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">But a couple miles after they’d left Kings highway, Edith made another whispered suggestion. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Let’s take them to Brooklyn Hospital, Louie. Something’s really wrong with that kid.”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Which would have been a good idea. Except the Belt Parkway was out. Not just closed. From what Lou could make out three blocks away, long sections had cracked and slanted out of alignment.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">For the next three hours, Lou wound their way through east Brooklyn neighborhoods, and little Johnny got sicker. Cheri too. The young woman was hyperventilating and the kid looked <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">green.</span> He couldn’t stop crying either.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">When they got into Queens, Edie agreed they should give up and try again to get over to Jake’s place in Jersey.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">But at the George Washington Bridge turnoff, it looked like no one was getting anywhere. And there was still no cellphone signal. When the minivan ahead slowly veered off a northbound exit, Lou followed. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Maybe we can get up across the Tappan Zee Bridge? Drop down into Fort Lee from there?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Another three hours, traffic channeling them this way, that way. Lou grabbed a look over his shoulder. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Kid isn’t breathing too well. Looks sweaty.</span> Somehow they’d narrowly avoided getting completely stuck, but they weren’t making great progress either. They were still in Queens. Lou turned on the radio. The announcer said something about emergency hospital services at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Hmmm . . .</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Lou! Stop!”</span> Edie screamed. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Louie! Stop the car!”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Lou Goodman mashed the brakes as Cheri Enriquez flung open the rear door.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Too late. Little Johnny was already puking his guts out on the back seat. The Goodmans helped Cheri and Johnny outside. The kid was really heaving it up when the thick dark clouds over their heads began to drizzle.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">What started as a mist soon thickened. Within a minute all four of them were being pissed on by stinging black rain as the clouds grew even heavier and pushed in toward the city.</p>
