<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre5">“We should start</span> east around here.” From the helicopter’s left front seat Franklin pointed an upright flat hand at the left window. “Toward 59th Street. Cynthia’s place should be almost straight over. Maybe we can land at the south end of Central Park?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon began a shallow bank to the left.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Chuck leaned forward between the seats to study the cobalt-blue eyes of the dark-haired man who had pulled him into this. “So I’m getting the idea we’re going to look for your sister before we try to save anyone else?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin turned a hard mouth back on the Red Cross man. “That’s right. Do you have anyone here, Chuck?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“All my relatives moved to Florida five years ago. I was the holdout. Just asking — I’d do the same.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">To Everon, it felt good to have only buildings to watch out for — instead of people like Marsh and Vandersommen. But the rotor blades were getting close. Columbus Circle was dead ahead. He could feel pockets of heat rising.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He glanced at the engine instruments. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Running a bit warm — should go higher okay. </span>He lifted the collective delicately. The whine of the turbine increased. The Pelican began to climb.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">By the way he was crabbing, a light tailwind was still blowing from the west. He looked through the top of the helicopter’s front windows and muttered, “High broken clouds. Snow tomorrow . . .”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Out above the radioactive anvil.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Six hundred feet,” Everon called out. “That should be enough, especially if we head across the park.” He began to level out. “Nothing’s as high as I remember it.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Tops of skyscrapers in big chunks littered the streets.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He glanced at the turbine temperature gauges. The needle had risen a little but appeared stabilized below the red zone. “Hanging in there,” he muttered.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">A huge <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">BOOM</span> answered him, Chuck screaming, “Oh shit!” as the helicopter was pushed backwards, nose tilting high, a huge ball of yellow fire blossoming in the air before them, expanding as if to pull them inside.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon yanked up on the collective, maxing the throttle, pulling back the stick, trying to halt their forward path — struggled to keep them from the flames.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">As Franklin watched his older brother’s deft touch on the controls try to defy the craft’s desire to kill them all, he felt strangely calmer than he knew he should have. And he wondered if indeed they would all three die — Everon, Franklin, Cynthia — today in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The blades overhead whumped still louder, flexing against the strain.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Everon has abilities in so many places, </span>he thought, <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">things I have no understanding of — solar power, electronics, his ability to fly — his competence in business and in everything he touches.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">The earsplitting whine of the turbines rose higher.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Why can’t I do the things Cynthia or Everon know how to do? Why can I never think my way through the air the way Everon can — or do statistical analysis like Cynthia does?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Those processes escaped him. He knew the words, the concepts, even the histories of the sciences involved. But there was some barrier he couldn’t get past. Sometimes he wondered if it was self-imposed, something he wouldn’t <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">allow</span> himself to see. To feel even.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He studied Everon’s profile. His brother’s arms, jaw flexing as he willed the old helicopter to stay in the air. He could feel the heat of the fire reaching out for them.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Despite Everon’s usual fun-loving sarcasm, his brother never had anything darker underneath. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">The way you and Cynthia are so good at living in the moment — Not like me, romanticizing the past, philosophizing over some random future that may never come. Worried too much over what I’m making of my life.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Somehow you guys always live in the now.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">I wonder what Cynthia is thinking? Is she trapped somewhere in the apartment with Steve and Melissa? Is Cynthia even with her family?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon released a huge exhale. Franklin looked outside. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">I guess if I’m worried about being in the moment, I’m not in the moment now.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">The craft was responding, backing away from the flame’s edge. The broken tops of buildings dropped below.</p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer076" class="p_divider1"><span><img alt="" src="image54.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">“What is that</span> thing?” Franklin asked as the old red and white helicopter climbed above the fireball.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I’ve seen one before,” Everon yelled back. “With Cyn and Steve, one night, having drinks on the eighth floor of the Marriott Marquis. Down Broadway, at 41st Street was this flaming ball of fire maybe five stories high. The three of us took a walk after dinner. It was still burning. Roaring up out of the street. The buildings acting like a chimney. A cop at the barricades said a major gas main was broken.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Gas</span> main?” Chuck said, looking back out the side windows. “This one’s a lot more than five stories.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Yeah,” Everon nodded. “The whole city’s underlain with hundreds of ’em and the pressure’s on.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The city flattened out before them. Through the smoke over middle Manhattan, the fire and destruction, was a vision of Hell on Earth. Building tops appeared bowled over. As if a giant’s hand had slewn across them sideways.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Oh my God!” Chuck gasped. “It’s <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">gone!”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">The top half of what had once been the tallest building in the world, the symbol of the city, was missing. Like dozens of other skyscrapers around it, the Empire State had been cut in half like a broken saguaro cactus, leaving only the nubs of uneven girders sticking up above lower ragged concrete floors and shell.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The U.S. had weathered all kinds of things — civil war, world war, financial collapse. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Can it weather this? Are we at war now?</span> Franklin wondered. Some countries rose and fell in a matter of years. The U.S. was unique. Of all the places he’d traveled to, he’d seen no other country founded for the purpose of protecting the individual. Something <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">that</span> strong had to corrode first on the inside.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">South of 20th Street or so, not even steel frameworks remained. The giant’s hand had swept out, destroying everything in its path from somewhere near the bottom tip of Manhattan Island. Until up around 42nd, where a kind of transition zone appeared.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">While Times Square was a flaming wreck, just blocks north, less than half were on fire. There was a new pattern. Those close to street corners were gone — but structures in blast-shadows of what had been taller buildings remained standing. But for their missing window glass, some looked completely untouched.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Crossing one thousand feet,” Everon said loudly.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Look at Broadway,” Franklin said. “The blast must have been channeled by the open spaces —”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Like the avenues were rivers,” Chuck said. “The lower end of the city is gone. The damage up here is selective.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Overpressure decreases with the cube of the distance,” Everon yelled.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Maybe there’s a chance that Cynthia —”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Of course there’s a chance,” Everon yelled back. “But let’s not start painting false pictures like you do on Sundays.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin hung a piercing blue stare on his brother, sucked his lips inward, taking deep breaths. “That way,” he pointed. “Straight across the bottom of the park.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon softened. “Sorry, Bro.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Bro. He hasn’t called me that in a long time and it’s the second time today,</span> Franklin realized. He and Everon were step-brothers. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Not </span>bro,<span class="c_span_body-char-italic"> but</span> Bro.<span class="c_span_body-char-italic"> Like he’s trying to connect himself, bond more tightly to the family.</span> <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">He’s as upset as I am —</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Cynthia’s chances were slim. Franklin knew it. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">The likelihood of anyone still alive on the Upper East Side — </span>he closed his eyes and hallucinated finding Cynthia’s building completely blown away — nothing but rubble. He could smell the burning drywall, hear the flames. The hallucination became stronger as he saw in his mind the corpses — his sister, Cynthia’s husband and daughter — lying there, sightless eyes staring up at him.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“At least the smoke helps block the sun,” Chuck yelled over their shoulders.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon nodded back.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Across the far east sky, the poisonous anvil-headed radiation cloud stretched even farther and darker — out across Long Island now where snow and rain were likely to bring death to thousands.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Hey! </span>Another helicopter!” Chuck pointed.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">A Bell Executive flew into view from behind the broken frame of the Empire State. Its doors bore a huge logo, a gold crown. Underneath in three-foot gold letters was a single word: KING.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Nathan King,” Everon said. “He bought the Empire State Building last year.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Before Everon could push the stick over to bank them toward Central Park, out of nowhere an F-18 fighter flashed past their windows. A moment later, a fast-attack Cobra gunship rose to hover along their right side, its single machine cannon targeting the old Sea Pelican.</p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer077" class="p_divider6"><span><img alt="" src="image55.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">Beneath the ready</span> emotion, Nathan King’s deep coolness was missing, mutated into a profound sorrow mixed with rage. It twisted his jovial features.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Fuck!” he said softly, shoulders slumped, watching his city burn from the side window of his private helicopter. “There’s nothing left!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“How is this different?”</span> those who knew him so well — friends, employees, business associates — might have asked. His moods, so volatile — one day intense, the next, wild — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">sadness, joy, whatever — it doesn’t matter.</span> <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">As long as it entertains! Oh, yeah — and get the hell out of my critical path!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">But anyone could have guessed the answer: <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“How often does a man lose everyone he cares about, everything his life is built on — in a flash of light?”</span> Everything he loved, even his parents, killed during a night he’d been doing business in London.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">To confirm their deaths King rushed across the Atlantic, came up here to see for himself. The eight sky-piercing buildings he’d created — his parents’ penthouse in one of them — gone.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He straightened. Louder and with a touch of vehemence, asked, “What do we know, John?” John Mayhew, his executive assistant, had lost people too.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Well, Mr. King, the information we have so far from the military shows two to three hundred kilotons. The blast —”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“No, not that stuff, John. What does the government say? What do our contacts say? <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Goddammit! I want to know who did this! Don’t you?”</span></p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer078" class="p_divider1"><span><img alt="" src="image56.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">From the gunship’s</span> open side cargo door, a soldier held up a whiteboard penned with thick black numbers. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">FREQ 121.5.</span> A clipped military voice over a megaphone echoed the same thing.<span class="c_span_body-char-italic"> “Go to frequency 121.5! Now!”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Chuck leaned up between the seats and Everon handed him the microphone. “Looks like you’re on deck.” Everon dialed the frequency into the helicopter’s radio display.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“This is Chuck Farndike with a Red Cross mission out of Teterboro.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The response was immediate. “You have no authorization to be here, Mr. Farndike. All traffic is restricted.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“We’re on an emergency Red Cross mission.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I’m sorry, Mr. Farndike, your tail number’s not listed as authorized. You’ll have to return to New Jersey.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon asked over the radio, “What’s the King helicopter doing in here?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“That is not your concern!” the military pilot responded. “Follow us back across the Hudson. Now, please.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The pilot’s tone offered no options.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin held out his hand. “Let me give it a try.” Chuck handed over the microphone.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">In a smooth calm voice half an octave lower than he usually spoke, Franklin said: “We have on board potassium iodide and other medical supplies. People down there are waiting for our help. Our mission was a last-minute Red Cross addition. Please check with Teterboro and allow us to continue.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I’m sorry, you’ll have to —”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Let them do what they can,” a new voice said. “At least call it in.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“This is an emergency channel. Identify yourself!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Nathan King.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The radio went silent.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“King!”</span> Everon said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Seconds ticked by, both helicopters hovering over 59th Street, fifteen hundred feet in the air.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“The tower people have my backup radio,” Everon said. “I fixed their generator too.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Let’s hope your friends in the tower back us up,” Franklin nodded.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The radio crackled. “Uh — your flight has been authorized. Non-military personnel are not allowed south of Forty-Second Street. Radiation levels are too high. For your own protection.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Understood. Thank you,” Franklin said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon banked the aircraft left and began descending on a northeasterly course toward Central Park.</p>
