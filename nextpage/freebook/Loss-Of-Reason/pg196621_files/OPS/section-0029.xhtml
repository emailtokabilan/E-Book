<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre5">Franklin’s climbing harness</span> lay abandoned on the floor.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“It’s over. She’s gone.” Everon’s face stayed straight ahead, talking loudly at the windshield, “We tried, Bro.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Ten survivors turned away from the Manhattan shore, and the Sea Pelican’s windows were filled by the rusty-green of the Hudson River, on their right the blue-gray span of the George Washington Bridge. In the narrow track of blue between the pilots’ seats, the morning sky swarmed thick with giant insects — helicopters of every size and color heading toward Manhattan to rescue whoever they could find.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin got off his knees between the front seats. Left his brother to handle the Sea Pelican’s controls. Moved back to take a space at the forward end of the passenger compartment’s long side-bench.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Chopping off body parts one at a time is too good for whoever did this to us . . .” Chuck shouted over the Pelican’s whomping roar. Franklin let the big man rant. Soon they’d be back at Teterboro.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Not finding Cynthia filled Franklin with a lowness he’d never felt before. Not the Army. Not the church. He felt like crying — if it would do any good. He couldn’t admit to himself what Everon had already accepted: <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Cynthia and Steve and Melissa. They have to be dead.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">But his inner eye kept seeing Cynthia’s building. The debris. The walls. The alley behind. There just wasn’t any way down there.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">On the long seat next to Franklin, the pain of the dark-haired woman, Victoria, seemed to have diminished to a level she was able to handle. Next to her, Walter van Patter’s head bandage had bled through. Chuck was replacing it.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin listened as the MTA transit engineer debated quietly with Clarence over where the bomb must have come from.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin studied the Russians on the opposite bench seat along the helicopter’s right side. The Russian man, Petre, was holding his wife, Kat. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Could it be? The Russians? Or maybe some Al Qaeda-ISIS-Muslim group, like the extremists who brought down the World Trade Center?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Who cares!</span> Franklin thought.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Tyner Kone was the only loud one. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“How long ’til we get back? Can’t this thing go any faster?” — </span>and was still at it now crossing the river. Chuck looked like he wanted to lean over, open the door and shove the little bureaucrat out.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin ignored Kone, staring ’til his eyes went out of focus. Something was gone now. Something he knew could never be replaced. He thought of stories he’d heard on the physical weight of the soul, a body losing as much as a pound when it left, and wondered, <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Do Cynthia’s and Steve’s bodies weigh any less now than they had alive? Does their little daughter Melissa’s?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">But he knew their physical weight wasn’t the thing that was missing. Franklin and Everon had always been somewhat isolated from each other. Cynthia had been their link. Phone calls. News updates, passing information. Now that link was broken. Gone.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">What kind of a person would do a hellish thing like this?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon was right. They would never find out. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Like a missing soul, the bomb’s gone. What’s left after an explosion to tell anybody anything about who’s behind it?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">His thoughts were jerked away by a swift movement between two cumulus clouds, a glint of reflected sun outside the helicopter’s left windows.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Fighter jet!” Chuck called out. “Probably protection from more attacks.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I don’t know how much good that’s going to do anybody now,” the transit engineer said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">They watched the tiny jet disappear, then re-appear on the helicopter’s right, over the George Washington Bridge.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What’s that?” Victoria pointed.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What?” Franklin said, not really paying attention.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Right there. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">There!</span> <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">There</span> — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">it goes again!”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Somebody dumping stuff off the GW,” Clarence said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin’s eyes focused suddenly. “No they aren’t! Those are bodies! Those are people falling off the bridge!”</p>
