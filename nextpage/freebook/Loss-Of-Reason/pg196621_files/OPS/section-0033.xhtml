<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre5">The huge ball</span> of fire was still in the way. From the look on Everon’s face, the jerky movements of his hands on the controls, the wind had strengthened and was gusting from the east. Out 60th Street, a wall of black mist was moving toward them.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">None of it could matter.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Let me down over there,” Franklin pointed. “On that.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon took one look. All of two seconds — “No, <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">no way, Bro!</span> You can’t! It’s suicide!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">A falling statue’s descent had been arrested by the top of a water tank, on the building separated by the alley behind Cynthia’s building. It was some kind of winged creature. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">An angel?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Its feet and the lower tips of its huge flared wings had pierced the tank’s round lid. It had come to rest about knee high. One end of a narrow steel I-beam sat nestled between the arched, protruding top of the broad, curved left wing, and the statue’s ugly head.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Not an angel. A stone gargoyle.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">The I-beam’s other end sat across the alley on the top remaining floor of Cynthia’s building. Four stories in the air.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Even if you find them, how would you get them out?” Everon shouted.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I’ll take some rope, lower them over the side.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon was right. He didn’t have to do this. He could just stop. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">No!</span> He <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">couldn’t!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I have to know!” he cried. “We have to know!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Are you both fucking <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">crazy?</span> Is <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">he?”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Hey!” Clarence jumped in at Kone. “Do you realize you’re speaking to a —”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“It’s okay,” Franklin said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I don’t care if he’s the Queen of Sheba.” Kone was looking down through the window and let out a piercing, maniacal laugh. “You can’t be serious!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The roly-poly bureaucrat’s words hung on the fetid air.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">But in his mind, Franklin saw Cynthia, Steve, Melissa, burned, injured, somewhere in the mess below. Victoria, Walter van Patter, the others were watching him.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Am I crazy?” he said. “Maybe right now a little.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">But Kone’s doubt seemed to buck Everon up. Everon shook his head, lips pinched. “I’ll get you as close as I can.” He turned northward, then hovered them over the middle of a twenty-yard gap.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin slung a coil of rope over one shoulder.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Isn’t that rain?” Kone pointed through the east windows. “Is that radioactive? That can’t be more than a mile or two away!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Ready on the hoist,” Chuck said, a determined pressure visible around the big man’s mouth.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin hooked his harness to the cable with a carabiner then swung himself through the Pelican’s wide doorway. This time he was ready for the freezing rotor blast. Chuck pressed the down button. Franklin began to drop.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">His toes touched down on a wobbly beam more than three stories in the air. Franklin centered his mass, feet sideways, single file. The beam’s top was only inches wide. It hadn’t come to rest flat but angled slightly upward toward Cynthia’s building. A foul-smelling wind took his hair behind him, pushed at his chest, his shoulders. He stood wavering, knees bent, hands out trying to find his balance.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">As Chuck slowly let out more line, Franklin took a deep breath and released his harness from the hoist cable.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He took another breath and slid his right foot forward. Left foot step. A long way down to the jagged pile of junk at the bottom. Slide-step. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">What am I doing? Maybe Kone’s right. I must be out of my mind.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">His only safety net was to fall on his chest or arms and try to hang on. This was the craziest thing he had ever done.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The girder wobbled. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Or is it the statue? Is it slipping?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">He waited. The rope coiled over his shoulder made balance difficult.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Step. Slide-step.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">It would be no worse than the splat falling from Ash Cave.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Heights had once bothered him. Years ago he had found a way to fool part of his mind into thinking he was only a few feet in the air.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Step. Slide-step.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He caught the beam’s rhythm and moved faster. As long as he remained in some way connected to the ground he was okay.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">He. Was. Across!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">As he stepped off the beam’s edge onto open floor, the beam slid backwards, statue disappearing into the water tank. He watched his end of the long beam fall end-over-end into the alley below.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The fireball flared and he felt the heat against his cheek. On his other side, wind from the rotor blades whipped up a storm of swirling garbage. The floor shook, vibrating — each step like walking on poorly supported plywood.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Has to be concrete, though, doesn’t it? </span>he thought, waving Everon away.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The helicopter moved up the block, the blades still loud but his footing didn’t vibrate so much.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Dark smoke drifted across what was left of Cynthia’s apartment. Twisted pieces of metal, piles of block from other buildings. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Definitely the right place though. Strange, the file cabinet wasn’t touched.</span> It sat by itself against a chunk of one remaining exposed brick wall.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">There seemed to be no other sign of Cynthia or Steve or Melissa. Areas of jaggedly broken brick wall still separated the apartment from its neighbors — he wondered if he really was standing in the right one. The thick smoke stung his eyes, burned his nostrils. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Isn’t their bedroom across from the room this cabinet was in? Could the cabinet have moved?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">For a moment a breeze blew the smoke away, and the corner of the pink blanket he’d noticed from the chopper protruding from the third file cabinet drawer, waved in the wind. And then, two apartments over, his eye caught on a roll of burned cloth, seven or eight feet long, three feet in diameter.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He felt himself being pulled toward it.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Some type of garbage, an old rolled-up rug.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">But it was too familiar. He knew that pattern. Too well.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The blackened outside let only a little of the bright colors show through — in small places — yellow and orange, green and red and blue. A comforter. A Mexican blanket. The edge of a woven design. A giant round Aztec calendar stone that he knew filled the entire center.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He knelt down. There was a large dark stain across its middle he’d never seen before. A scratching, sucking sound as he carefully peeled back the crisp outer layer.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">And his sister’s eyes opened to him.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Cynthia!”</p>
