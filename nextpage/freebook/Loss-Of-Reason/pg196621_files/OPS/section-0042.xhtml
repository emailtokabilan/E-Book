<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre5">A</span><span class="calibre10"> </span><span class="calibre5">giant of</span> a helicopter roared in low overhead. The largest Franklin had ever seen — long and fat.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Suspended beneath on four cables was slung a semi-truck container. Its crisp white paint job, like that on the chopper, bore a huge red WILLIAMS POWER logo on its side. The amount of air the giant moved as it passed was like a small windstorm.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin walked faster until he was up with Everon and Chuck again. “I thought you wanted to get out of here? That black mist looks like it’s crossing the river,” Franklin pointed.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">But Everon wasn’t listening.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The helicopter descended near the end of the row of big tents.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Shouldn’t we —”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Hold on,” Everon barked.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Soldiers ran over, unhooked cables, opened doors on the semi container’s front and rear. They pulled out heavy wires, ran them to one of the hospital tents. A motor cranked up. Bright lights came on. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Emergency diesel generator,</span> Franklin realized.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">But as the huge helicopter banked away, the air it moved didn’t calm. Now it was gusty. The wind was picking up again.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Everon!” waved a tall salt-and-pepper-haired man in a dark suit from the door of their Lear.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Hunt?” </span>Everon called out.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Hunt Williams,</span> Franklin figured.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I see you brought one of your backup generators.” Everon studied the soldiers operating its controls. “Need to find out what’s going on with it?” he added doubtfully.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“The Army asked me to bring it,” Hunt said, “but no, my pilot could have handled this without me. I came here to talk to you.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Me?” Everon and Chuck rolled the stretcher up against the Learjet’s side door.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Hunt threw a questioning glance at the charred cocoon as they pushed it back into the jet’s passenger area.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“My sister and her husband,” Everon said. “We found them on the Upper East Side.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Oh. I’m very sorry,” Hunt said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">From somewhere along the taxiway Everon had obtained what appeared to be a large rubber — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">a body bag,</span> Franklin realized. He watched Everon unfold it alongside the bulging Aztec blanket and push one edge underneath, his jaw clamped together, tugging its zipper back and forth between the charred blanket and the jet’s floor.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Chuck moved in to help lift one side of the cocoon, but Everon gently moved the big man’s arm away as if to say, <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“I have this.”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Chuck stood there, silently watching. Franklin couldn’t.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He scooted Harry’s soup box back beneath the jet’s small side table. Harry slanted his head up at Andréa. She was flipping quickly through a bunch of charts, pulling more from a pouch next to the pilot’s seat.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin took the seat next to her. Melissa let out a wail.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Oh! Who’s this?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">To a shocked Andréa, Franklin explained as briefly as possible how and where they’d found Melissa in the city.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“How long has she been wearing that?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Eighteen hours maybe? I don’t know.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Andréa put away the maps.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Together they peeled off his niece’s soiled pink nightsuit. Andréa wrapped a strip of what looked like part of a blue airline blanket between Melissa’s legs, then doubled over the rest and wrapped Melissa up in it, cleverly finishing the job with several strips of white medical tape. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Who’s going to take care of her now?</span> Franklin wondered. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Grandma Del, I guess.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Andréa pulled out some milk to warm up in the jet’s microwave.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Don’t give her that,” Chuck said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He fished a short disposable bottle and a can of baby formula out of his big green case. “Here.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">A few minutes later Melissa was greedily sucking it down.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin threw a handful of airline peanuts into Harry’s soup box.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">With Melissa slurping softly, Harry answering in his soft <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“hup-hup-hup-hup,”</span> Franklin let his eyes close. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">We have to get out of here,</span> he thought. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">That cloud is coming.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Andréa says you have time in a Gulfstream?” he heard Hunt ask.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Uh-huh,” Everon grunted, like he was trying to force the middle of the bag past something.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Probably that damn piece of metal, </span>Franklin thought<span class="c_span_body-char-italic">.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Obviously all the generating plants surrounding the city are out,” Hunt said, “— from Long Island, to over here in New Jersey. What nobody expected was Llanerch, Mercer, Schuylkill, that we’d have so much system damage all the way down through —”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What? <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">In Pennsylvania?</span> How far?” Everon grunted, struggling. “I remember you buying this for them, Bro.” Everon wasn’t talking to Hunt now. “A house-warming gift for Steve and Cyn, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">There it was again, Franklin could still see it — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">that Aztec blanket waving in the Pacific roadside Baja breeze. </span>The thick tightly woven wool in orange and scarlet, forest green and lime — lots of lemon and turquoise.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“And now look at it,” Everon spat out, “all burned and charred.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin listened to his brother’s breathing. The pain there had nothing to do with a damaged blanket. Only what was wrapped inside.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">When Everon had been quietly working the bag’s zipper underneath again for half a minute or so, Hunt answered, “We don’t know exactly how far — the damage runs at least halfway across the state.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Did Ted and Stu stick around for the rest of the convention?” Everon asked, worry lines creasing his forehead.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Yes,” Hunt answered bitterly.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon said nothing.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“And now the President’s ordered the nuclear plants shut down,” Hunt said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“He has?</span> Why would he do something like that?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“He’s worried about a bomb hitting one of the reactors.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“It was a sea attack, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Looks that way.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What an idiot.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Hunt nodded. “Gas stations can’t pump gas. Hospitals and prisons are on their emergency generators.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Uh — speaking of hospitals, I better get back,” Chuck said softly.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The Aztec cocoon was in. Everon slowly zipped up the bag. The wind blew stronger. Franklin felt the plane move as Everon stepped outside. It felt like something darkened the sun.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“That cloud’s coming in, Hunt,” he heard Everon say. Then, “I don’t know how we can ever thank you.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Why would someone do this?</span> Franklin wondered. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Killing so many with the push of a button, however it was done. </span>Franklin kept seeing his sister’s smile, a smile he would never see again. Climbing and Cynthia’s love of history had been her own links with Franklin. He was sure Everon already felt the loss of Cynthia’s silly humor, popping up at the oddest times. The greatest sister who ever lived.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“No problem.” Chuck’s voice.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Strangers, people the killers would never meet. How could someone even think that way?</span> Franklin wondered. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Whoever did this, there’s no punishment, no form of death bad enough.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Part of him wanted to see the person behind it burning over a spit of fire, twisting painfully — skin bubbling, hair shriveling — chunks of flesh burning off their bones. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">To watch their blood boil as their marrow exploded into that last vestige of </span>withering<span class="c_span_body-char-italic"> consciousness.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin opened his eyes, suddenly realizing Chuck had gone. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">I didn’t even thank him? What am I doing thinking like that?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">He jumped from the plane and dodged through the milling crowd.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Chuck!</span> Chuck, wait!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Chuck turned around, startled.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Thanks a lot, my friend,” Franklin said, giving the big man a one-armed hug.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“No problem,” he said bashfully. “Other circumstances, I’d have said I enjoyed it. Glad to do something useful.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The big man walked away.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">So many refugees,</span> Franklin thought, unable to avoid bumping shoulders on his way back. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">How are they going to get out of here before the cloud comes?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Inside the plane, Hunt was unfolding a large white map. “Take a quick look at this copy of our power grid . . . <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Everon?”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon, stepped outside, looked at the sky, turned and quickly climbed back in, a scowl on his face. “We have to get out of here, Hunt.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I understand, what I’m trying to say is . . .”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin turned to Andréa. “Could you watch Melissa for me?” He glanced at the owl. “Keep an eye on Harry? Just for a couple of minutes? We need to find some people to fill up this plane.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“No problem.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Six, max!” </span>Everon called after him. “And make it really quick, Bro!”</p>
