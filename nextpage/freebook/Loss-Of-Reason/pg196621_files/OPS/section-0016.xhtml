<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre5">At the jet</span> Franklin introduced Chuck to Andréa and began to tell her about the Red Cross clearance. She held up a hand, shaking her head, “I have some bad news for you. I know you guys wanted to go into the city.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What?” Franklin’s breath caught.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Everon lost the helicopter.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“The one he rented?” Franklin asked.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“The Army took it.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Damn military just let us in!” Chuck said fiercely. “Doesn’t sound like our clearance will do us much good now, does it?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin’s lips silently formed a swear word he didn’t use anymore. He stared at the ground. All he could see was Cynthia, Steve, Melissa — trapped beneath burning beams, surrounded by fire that raged like pain, through the veins of his wrists, the tendons of his palms.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“At least I was able to get you back in to your jet,” Chuck said. “I’ll leave you some iodine drops.” As he flicked the latches on his case he spoke to Andréa. “You should both take some right away. Protects the thyroid.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Hey!” Andréa pointed over Franklin’s shoulder. “Look at that!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Far down the street, in the control tower lights a tree tilted. Its angle slowly increased, picking up speed until it fell behind the tower.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Wonder what that’s about.” Chuck said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">A minute later, a young guy in a shaggy green coat ran up carrying a chain saw, checking numbers on aircraft, breath pumping out clouds of white steam. “Who’s Franklin Reveal?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I am.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He threw a thumb over his shoulder, “Your brother’s looking for you. Third building down. He said to tell you: Grab your stuff, and <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">hurry!”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin quickly threw the straps to his bags over his shoulders, too rushed to notice that airport security guard Vandersommen was back, watching from the shadows.</p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer062" class="p_divider1"><span><img alt="" src="image43.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">The old Coast</span> Guard bird was as ready as Everon could make it with the tools he had available. He gave the starter a try. No less cranky than its owner, the exhaust ports coughed out blasts of thick black smoke. But he kept at it, turning the big turbine over and over. He could hear the starter grinding down as its batteries ran out of juice.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Hopeless,</span> he thought.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He switched over to engine number two. It turned over more slowly than the first —</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The old engine made a rattling sound, belched out more of the black stuff and cleared. The big blades began to turn. Their speed increased. The old Pelican was running!</p>
<p class="p_body_para">With the second engine to draw on, he tried the first turbine again. This time it spun up quickly and lit. The rotor turned faster now. Everon pushed up the RPMs until both engines smoothed out. He slid a gnarled old headset he’d found back in the crew compartment over his ears and from the floor between the seats pulled the collective arm gently upward with his left hand, testing the ability of the spinning blades to grab air. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Nothing!</span> He cranked on the arm’s motorcycle grip and pulled again. He felt the old rattletrap lighten until he’d lifted her off a few inches. His spirits rose with it.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">A crackly voice came over his headset. “Helicopter near the museum, this is Teterboro Tower. We show no clearance granted to any aircraft at this time.” Apparently the old radio was working too.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Engine run-up only,” Everon answered as he put the chopper’s wheels back on the ground.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The Pelican was giving the impression it might just take them into the city — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">and back.</span> Now the problem was again to obtain clearance. But one thought filled him: <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">I’m going in this time whether I get permission or not!</span></p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer063" class="p_divider1"><span><img alt="" src="image44.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">It was cold</span> out. The sun was about to rise. Franklin, Chuck and Andréa found Everon inside a big red and white helicopter, its blades already turning.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What<span class="c_span_body-char-italic"> is </span>this?” Franklin yelled over the sound of the engine.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Helicopter, looks like!” Everon yelled back.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“This is Chuck Farndike,” Franklin introduced. “He’s the regional Red Cross blood coordinator.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Nothin’ like a Slick,” Chuck yelled.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What?” Everon mouthed.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Troop carrier. No weapons. Called ’em Slicks in the Army — Hogs, Frogs ’n Chunkers all had missiles or heavy weapons. Here!” Chuck untwisted a cap from a bottle and pushed a dropper full of some brown liquid toward Everon’s face. “Let me put some of this under your tongue.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon eyeballed the overweight guy in muttonchops. “What is it?” he yelled.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Lugol’s Solution. We’re goin’ in, aren’t we? Hospital’s nearly out of iodine pills. It’ll have to do — protect our thyroids!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon let him put the drops under his tongue.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">From his bag, Chuck pulled an old gray box the size of a loaf of bread.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Radiation counter,” Everon acknowledged, surprised. “Good!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">For Chuck’s part, he was actually covering up the deep twisting dread running through his gut at the prospect of going into the city, something he hadn’t felt since the years he’d last flown on a combat chopper. Diverting his fear by thinking about what he should take, <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">jabbering on like some young weenie about the Lugol’s.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Then again, some part of him felt more afraid of <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">chickening out. And</span> some part really did want to go, something inside that felt totally underused doing those blood donations. It was <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">this,</span> had convinced him to go in the first place — not the things this wacky dark-haired minister said to him, whatever they were.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon pulled his brother forward by the jacket into the cockpit. “What’s with the bullfrog?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Would Red Cross authorization help us?” Franklin smiled, his first since getting on the jet.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“He’s</span> our way in? How’d you convince him?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin shrugged. “Tell you about it later. Can you fly this thing?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I haven’t logged many helicopter hours lately. Nan usually flies our MD-900 jobs. But this is just a more beat-up version of one I flew down in Houston, a personnel transport out to a couple of oil rigs.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“How long?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“How long what?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“How long since you’ve flown <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">any</span> helicopter?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I flew our MD-900 last year.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“And one of these?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon was busy checking fuses when he said it. “Fifteen years.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin shrugged. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Better than nothing I guess.</span> He’d never seen an aircraft their older brother couldn’t fly.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin took a look through the rear cabinets. Beneath one bench seat he found four thick stainless cables, each terminated in an eyelet. Their other ends were joined by a large hook.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“There’s a cargo hook back there!” he told Everon. “Do we need it?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Maybe.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Chuck Farndike pulled out a folded pair of huge Red Cross stickers. Shoved his heavy green suitcase under a bench. What they didn’t use they could leave in Manhattan.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">There’s a problem, </span>Franklin realized. He looked at Chuck. “We have to switch the tail number!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Damn,” Chuck said, “you’re <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">right!</span> What’s the —” he stepped outside, a moment later back in. “Two-Two-Bravo-India. Twenty-Two-Bravo-India,” he repeated. “Man, I’ve got Six-Six-Six-Kilo-India on the brain.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin let Chuck take the helicopter’s left seat and Everon handed Chuck another old headset. Keeping his eyes on the radio, Franklin spoke in Chuck’s ear, softly yet forcefully, gripping Chuck’s right collar bone, “Really happy <span class="c_span_er-char-bold-italic">YOU GOTTA</span> be able to <span class="c_span_er-char-bold-italic">GET THAT CLEARANCE!”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Right!” Chuck answered. He reached overhead to dial in a frequency and began calling the tower.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin threw his duffel bags under the seat in the crew area. He and Andréa went outside and began applying Chuck’s huge Red Cross stickers to either side of the Pelican’s fuselage.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">When they came back in, Chuck dropped his headset on the seat. “I’m going over and talk to those bozos myself!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He ran off for the tower.</p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer064" class="p_divider1"><span><img alt="" src="image45.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre7">Did our original</span> <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">clearance get approved because Chuck requested a Red Cross mission, </span>Franklin wondered, <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">or because somebody knew the Army had already requisitioned Everon’s helicopter-from-Hell?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Andréa climbed in the back of the blasting Pelican with a case of bottled water and a box of energy bars, moved up into the cockpit and pulled the headset away from the left side of Everon’s head. “Do you really think they’ll let you go in?” she shouted.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“We’ll see. You fly the company choppers, don’t you? Do you know how to fly a Sea Pelican?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">She eyeballed the ratty old gray-metal cockpit dubiously. “Do <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">you?”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Well enough.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I’ve got to stay with the jet and try to contact Mr. Williams.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I could use a co-pilot.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">She shook her head. “This old derelict may not have much performance left in it. You’ve already got Franklin’s big Red Cross guy. If I go with you, it’s another survivor you can’t bring back.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He frowned and adjusted the throttle, trimming back power as the big engines smoothed out.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I put a case of water and some snack bars off the Learjet in back.” Her eyes looked up at him. “Be careful, will you?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon nodded. “Yeah.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">She kissed his lips hard and left.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Hunt would want her to stay with the plane? </span>If he really thought about it he was probably better off without her.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Chuck ran back breathing hard from the control tower and got in.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Fuck it!”</span> he yelled. “It’s in the pipeline. I called the first number in over the hospital-military radio. Now they’re giving me a hard time. Trying to reach some general — guy named Anders, military commander appointed by the President to oversee all airspace in the vicinity.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin stared at him. “That was Anders before — at the gate!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Shit!”</span> Chuck yelled. “Well, I’m not sitting around all day watching blood drain out of people’s arms like I did when the Trade Center went. Felt damned out of touch. I was an Army medic — really happy you boys asked me into the thick of things. We get hassled on the way in, I’ll get on the radio, see what I can do. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Waiting</span> for clearance! What stupid bureaucratic <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">bullshit</span> at a time like this!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin couldn’t agree more but rose both eyebrows to Everon. Everon shouted at Chuck, “So we act like we have all the clearances in the world — and hope for the best!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Exactly.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Works for me.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Watching the turbines’ temperatures, Everon brought them up to speed. The blades were really whomping now.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">A female voice came from the tower. “Helicopter at museum. You’ll need clearance to lift off. All Teterboro Airport flights are restricted today.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Sue?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Yes?” the voice came back.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“This is Everon, the guy whose radio you’re using? The guy who fixed your generator? We already have Red Cross clearance for our old chopper. Apparently there’s been some delay switching tail numbers to this one. They haven’t sent it over yet.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Oh. Let me check on that. See if I can speed it up for you.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin looked at his brother. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“She </span>sounded friendly!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon shrugged. “She knows what we’re trying to do.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Chuck tapped him on the shoulder. “Screw the clearance. It’ll come through on the way in.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin shrugged. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">To hell with waiting,</span> he mouthed silently.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Clear to fly or not, Everon wasn’t going to take a chance shutting the big Pelican’s turbines down. Prepared to feign ignorance on the next radio call, he began to lift off anyway.</p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer065" class="p_divider1"><span><img alt="" src="image46.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">Up in the tower,</span> Sue eyeballed Colonel Marsh who was busy talking to his men. She whispered to John, the other controller, so the military wouldn’t hear. “We have to stop him. Nobody should go in there!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Especially not him, right?” John looked at her sideways. “Jesus Christ, let him go. What if it was <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">your</span> sister! Hell, he gave us his radio, fixed our power! For fuck’s sake, Sue!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Flames burning above the city. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">It’s death to go in there. So maybe his sister </span>is<span class="c_span_body-char-italic"> in there.</span> She couldn’t admit to John or even to herself the deeper reason. She just didn’t want something to happen to that beautiful man.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Her eyes shot to the museum again. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Shit!</span> In the morning twilight, the helicopter’s white pontoons were gapping air above the corner of the museum’s roof — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">He’s lifting that damned old red and white death trap off the ground!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">She glanced at John. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">He knows the chopper’s rising! He isn’t even looking out the window.</span> He was staring at her. Watching her eyes. She hesitated, unsure what to do. She held her breath . . . and decided, giving only a small nod of her head.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">If it was really what that blond-haired man wanted to do, she wouldn’t say anything.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">An airport security guard ran up, now bending forward breathless. “Colonel!” he gasped. Marsh seemed to remind himself of the man’s name from the silver nameplate. VANDERSOMMEN.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“That guy who was up here has another helicopter and is attempting an unlawful flight from the museum!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Marsh glanced at the two controllers with irritation, and hesitated. An innate sense of fair play held him back, a growing respect. He’d heard about the four-place helicopter the man had rented, the one his men appropriated. The same man who had fixed the airport’s generator. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">And</span> re-established communications of a sort. None of it the Army had been able to do. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">What if it was my sister!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Sir, what about the fuel they’re burning?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Mmm,” Marsh hesitated, breathed out, resigned to the annoying little prick. Held out his hand. “Let me have that radio.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Sergeant,” he transmitted, “take some men around to the museum and stop that helicopter.”</p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer066" class="p_divider1"><span><img alt="" src="image47.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">Nose angled downward</span> in the semi-darkness, a team of six soldiers ran beneath them. Sergeant Page — uniform bunched at the hip — didn’t look happy.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“And that asshole guard Vandersommen is with them!” Everon shouted.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Coast Guard helicopter Bravo-India!” came over the radio. “You have no clearance. Land at once!” Everon recognized the voice of Colonel Marsh.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“You’ll have to shoot us down!” Chuck yelled back.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">As if they’d heard Chuck, five rifles and a pistol were targeted onto the old Sea Pelican.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Did they hear that?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Nope, Bro. Hadn’t keyed the mic.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon spun the tail around, jammed the big bird over and banked southeast, expecting bullets to come ripping through the fuselage any second.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">A mile later the tension suddenly drained out of him. He felt relieved of the night’s frustration. Just to be in motion. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Doing something. Moving.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">He didn’t know how far they would make it anyway. Right at takeoff he’d noticed what appeared to be a slow oil leak somewhere in the Pelican’s turbine seals, but he braced himself with the old dictum silently: <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">All helicopters leak.</span> He didn’t have time to fix it right now. Every minute lost was time taken from Cynthia and Steve and Melissa.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">No one in the dark houses and towers below seemed aware of their passing. A lone flashing police car moved down one of the side streets. Those able to leave had already left.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon scanned the early red horizon, wondering how far they’d get before the military tried something else to stop them.</p>
