<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre5">As Everon angled</span> the chopper more northward, a long arc of blue-gray pipe, vertical strings of cable, filled the windows. Franklin could see people getting through on the lower level, making their way around stalled cars.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">But on the upper deck, two 18-wheelers jackknifed butt-to-butt on a diagonal across the bridge formed a giant barrier, blocking all eight lanes. A third 18-wheeler, a FedEx rig, lay on its side, pinning the cab of the long silver container truck against a big commercial dumper at the north side of the bridge. Franklin could make out a Volkswagen Bug, its top hacked clear off, crammed beneath the orange semi’s chassis.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">People here and there were struggling to squeeze through narrow spaces. One woman popped out like shot from a cannon. There was blood on her face as she fell limply to the roadway. Those next to escape ran right over her. Like sports fans pushing out a single arena door, they were being compressed in a smashing mass crushing in on itself. But the pileup was acting like a funnel, sweeping the mob toward a wide hole something had broken in the bridge’s south side.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“There go two more!” Chuck cried out.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Pressure on the upper deck looked brutal. Tens of thousands crammed against its sides into a space meant to hold eight lanes of traffic. Like the city’s rats, thousands had made their way uptown on foot, expecting to escape across the blue-gray span.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">A long dark overcoat cocooned around a man who had fallen through the hole. Franklin could almost feel the scream from the man’s O-shaped mouth, red power-tie flapping alongside eyes huge with fear. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">If he hits flat-footed, it’ll drive the bones of his neck right up through his brain.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Then a woman. She could have had no idea where she was. Long legs, dark high-heels, white underwear high up on her waist, the blue fabric of her long skirt billowing about her head as she plummeted to the water below.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">A single fire boat raced to pick up bodies — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">people probably dead when they hit the water,</span> Franklin thought. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">At that speed it has to be hard as concrete. Even if they survive the fall, it’s freezing. Cold’s going to penetrate in seconds.</span> “Closer!” he shouted to Everon.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Must be two hundred thousand people up there!” Chuck shouted back.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“More!” yelled the train engineer.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“The whole north end of Manhattan is trying to get out over the bridge!” Clarence yelled.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Cynthia and Steve. There’s a chance they’re on the bridge too,” Franklin shouted.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Not much of one,” Everon shouted back.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Why not?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Think about the way their building looked. Their apartment. Think about what time it was when the bomb went off. What do you think they were doing at eight o’clock at night? Out for a stroll with Melissa?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Still, the slimmest of chances,</span> Franklin thought.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“They’re being crushed to death,” Victoria shouted, leaning her face against the window.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Transference of pressure,” Everon said loudly over his left shoulder. “People in back are only pushing a little. By the time it gets up front, the pressure becomes enormous.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">In slow motion, another section of large-diameter railing pipe bent outward to leave an even wider gap, where the monstrous mob launched more bodies into space.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“It’ll take days to get tow trucks in there,” Walter van Patter rasped.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Clarence shook his head. “Those semis ain’t going nowhere!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">It was getting worse. While they watched, people began falling by twos and threes.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon came to a dead hover, halfway between the two mid-span lattice towers, where the bridge’s main support pipeage curved down to the tops of the wrecked 18-wheelers — while half a dozen more people launched off the south side.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What’s he doing?” Kone yelled. Everyone ignored him.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Think we could enlarge that small opening between the wrecks?” Franklin said. “Use the big hook?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Someone would have to go down there and hook one of the semis up,” Chuck said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“No! It’s too dangerous!” Kone screamed. “Let someone else do it! You’ve got to get us to a hospital!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What happens if we land back at Teterboro and the Army won’t let us take off again?” Everon yelled back.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“All of us might know somebody in there,” the transit engineer said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Can this machine handle the load?” van Patter asked.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I think so,” Everon yelled.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“They’ll have to wait!” Kone said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“We can’t just leave them!” Victoria shot back.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Da! Da!” Petre and Kat pointed frantically out the right side window, urging someone do something as more were ejected from the bridge.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I demand you get us to New Jersey! Now!” Kone shouted.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">While they argued, a dozen more fell to their deaths, dropping through the hole in the bridge’s side. Part of Franklin felt like agreeing with Kone. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Cynthia and her family will never be found. What’s the point?</span> But another desperate voice inside wasn’t ready to give up. Not yet. A voice that said: <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Maybe they’re on the bridge!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Walter van Patter squinted at the chubby little bureaucrat. “You know, Mr. Kone, some of the most powerful people in the world are probably trapped on that bridge.”</p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer131" class="p_divider1"><span><img alt="" src="image96.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">Kone shut up.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin shuffled bent over, to keep from hitting his head, into the back of the passenger compartment. On the helicopter’s rear wall, he flipped out a handle and opened a three-foot-square door. He dragged the heavy cable harness across the floor, until its big curved hook caught under one of the seat supports. Petre freed the hook, and with the transit engineer, they pushed the heavy tangle to the side door.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin bent down between the front cockpit seats where he could speak with Everon. “I have to get the heavy-lift harness connected underneath.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Okay,” Everon nodded, gingerly handling the controls.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“The hook says it’s rated for six thousand pounds,” Franklin said. “Is that enough?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Maybe for one end of a trailer if we can find an empty one. Which one do you want to try?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Hold on.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin backed up to where Chuck waited. Together they slid back the big square door. Cold air poured in.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Clearly, there wouldn’t be much chance they could even slide one of the truck cabs out of the way. The engines alone probably weighed several tons. Of the jack-knifed trailers still on their wheels, the orange one had no cab. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Must have gone over the side through the hole.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">He moved back to the cockpit.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Forget the FedEx. It’s on its side <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">and</span> it’s probably full. Let’s try the orange trailer, the one with no cab in the inbound lanes. It’s only got that VW jammed under it.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Makes sense. Tell Chuck that’s the one and he can — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">WHOA!”</span> Everon’s left hand yanked upward on the collective arm as a sudden gust tried to drop them into the bridge cabling. He moved the cyclic stick before his knees with quick, jerky movements until the big bird steadied out twenty feet higher. “I’m going to — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">hold on!”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">He pushed several overhead switches. Immediately the whole ride smoothed out. “It works!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He glanced at Franklin. “Auto-stabilizer. I was afraid to try it.” He let out a deep breath. “That will make it easier. Okay, Bro. Too bad we don’t have all the communications stuff working. Signal to Chuck. He can tell me which way you want me as he lowers you down.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“All we need is to slide the back end of one trailer away from the other, right?” Franklin yelled in his brother’s ear. “Those containers — are they locked on their chassis?” Half the trailers on the roads these days were actually a separate container box that sat on an 18-wheeler chassis.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon’s eyes searched his memory. “Not necessarily,” he nodded. “Once we’re hooked on, I won’t raise it too high. Otherwise we could pull the box right off the truck bed!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Okay!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin backed up. Picked up the climbing harness where he’d left it on the floor. Slid his legs in and buckled its upper straps across his chest. Chuck clipped the loop on the front of the harness to the hoist carabiner.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin showed Chuck the orange container truck he wanted to try. But first they had to get the cable harness attached to the helicopter while still in the air.</p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer132" class="p_divider1"><span><img alt="" src="image97.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">Franklin took one</span> of the heavy cable eyelets in his right hand, gripped the overhead hoist bracket tubes with his left and lowered his weight onto the hoist cable. He hadn’t known what to expect until he swung through the open door. Freezing rotor wind blasted his hair.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Okay!”</span> he yelled.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Chuck held the hoist’s DOWN button until he was two feet below the Pelican’s body. Water ran from Franklin’s eyes. He could barely see.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">With the bulk of the heavy cable harness still inside the door, Franklin pulled himself underneath, around the right streamlined wheel pontoon.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“More slack!” he waved.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Chuck dropped him down another two feet.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Mounted to the underside of the Pelican’s airframe were four metal hooks, arranged in a rectangle. Using his legs he pushed himself into a position nearly horizontal, and reached out for the closest hook with a cable eyelet.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Chuck’s head appeared over the door edge.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“A little more!” Franklin yelled.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The cable dropped him another foot. He pushed with his legs and the first eyelet clipped into place. Chuck lay on his stomach and handed him another. The next two snapped easily into their hooks. The last one would be a stretch, way out to the helicopter’s far corner.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He strained against the hoist cable, swinging his arm and missed. His feet slipped off the sponson and his weight fell straight down jerking him onto the cable.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He got hold of the fourth eyelet, scrambled using his legs to push himself back up into position. He pointed his toes. Hand reaching out, lunging away from the wheel sponson, the eyelet scraped next to the hook. He fell away swinging back and forth in the violent wind again, not knowing if he had the strength to try again.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">But the cable was gone. It was hanging from the fourth hook.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He wiped the back of a gloved hand against his forehead, as Chuck shoved the rest of the heavy harness over the door edge and its cables untangled. The big hook squared into position, dangling twenty feet below.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin nodded. Chuck disappeared.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The helicopter began moving sideways to a spot above the rear of the cab-less orange semi-trailer that took up most of the four inbound lanes.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Inside, Everon yelled to Chuck, “How’s that?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Five feet to the rear. Okay — perfect! Hold it.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin saw Chuck reappear at the doorway edge. Franklin gave him a downward point. A moment later, Franklin felt himself descend.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">His feet contacted the top of the orange container with a clang. Below him on the crowded bridge deck, rotor-blade blast was whipping people’s hair, their clothes. Faces screamed up at him, people shaking fists in the air, flipping the middle finger. He had to focus.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">More hoist cable came down, giving him room to maneuver.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Chuck’s head appeared. Franklin waved the hook lower. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Closer!</span> Chuck vanished in the doorway.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The helicopter descended — until Franklin was able to grab the big hook and guide it sideways. At shipyards, cranes lifted these containers off their chassis and moved them directly onto ships for transport overseas. An eye was welded at each corner. It was one of these Franklin wanted.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Lower!”</span> Everon heard Chuck call out. “Looks like we’re still a couple feet high.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">They were very close to the minimum altitude Everon could risk. A long row of street lights ran along the sides of the bridge. He calculated the distance: <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">four lanes, each twelve feet wide — forty-eight feet to a side. Two sides: inbound and outbound, a little extra for the center divider — four feet maybe.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">A hundred feet.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">In the operating manual tucked behind the seat, the Pelican’s blades had been listed at sixty-two. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Blade tips to light poles, less than twenty feet to spare on a side.</span> Any lower, he’d be down inside them. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">One bad gust of wind and —</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">More people were being forced over the rails. His left hand made the tiniest dip in the collective.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">With a <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">CLANG!</span> that vibrated upward, the hook went into the corner eye. Franklin clung to one of the cables.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“He’s got it!” Chuck yelled in Everon’s ear.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Okay!</span> Everon thought<span class="c_span_body-char-italic">. Now if we can — </span>Gently he pulled. The whine of the turbines increased, the blade noise rising with the engine’s RPMs. He pulled the collective all the way up. The Pelican strained to rise several feet, then stopped. He waited. The effort was for nothing.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Just the rear of this trailer is too much,</span> he thought.<span class="c_span_body-char-italic"> The Pelican can’t lift it!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">“It must be full of something really heavy,” Chuck yelled.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Stop! Stop!” Kone yelled. “You’ll kill us all!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Down below, Franklin shook his head and waved Everon back down.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Okay,” Everon admitted, “maybe this was a bad idea. Tell my brother to cut us loose.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The helicopter descended enough to slack the cables. Franklin pushed the big harness hook from the trailer eye.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The helicopter rose, Franklin’s hoist cable retracting with it. It seemed people down there were giving up too. Instead of being crushed to death against the guardrails, they were deliberately jumping off the sides!</p>
<p class="p_body_para">At the very moment his feet left the box’s roof, he felt hands grip his right leg. A slim woman in her thirties with wavy light hair had somehow gotten to the trailer’s top.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Cynthia!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">But as the woman struggled to hold on, she looked directly into Franklin’s eyes. There was only a vague resemblance. The forehead, the nose. But not the eyes.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin reached to grab her beneath an armpit. But the woman slipped, falling toward the crowd, as if diving backward onto fans in a rock concert. <i class="calibre9">Her soul, </i>Franklin thought, <i class="calibre9">into those thousands of the screaming damned.</i></p>
