<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre5">“Another tree, ma’am?” </span>the soldier asked the nurse.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Oh, that would be a big help. Thank you.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He stood the light tree in the corner of the tent, back from the patients on their gurneys, and extended the pole. He plugged in the cord. The rectangular fixtures mounted either side threw a brilliant glow into every corner.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">And they all went <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">out!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">There were screams and cries around him in the dark. The nurse swore. More yells outside the tent.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The soldier fumbled around until he was able to poke his head out. A breaker had blown. They’d hooked up too many circuits.</p>

</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">From the Williams</span> Learjet, Andréa watched the lights go out, half the glowing makeshift tent-triage-city go dark.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Several minutes went by as soldiers scrambled dimly, calling back and forth. Finally the other half of the lights came back on. The military had reached the limit of their generators.</p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer091" class="p_divider3"><span><img alt="" src="image66.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">“Colonel Marsh?”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Marsh looked up from the map he was examining, to the face of an exquisitely beautiful red-haired woman.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Yes ma’am?” he gulped. Someone had let this woman into the command tent at the base of the airport tower. He’d have to recheck his men’s understanding of their orders. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Can’t have civilians just wandering around.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I don’t believe we’ve been introduced.” Her hand turned over his as they shook, a slight feminine bend to her wrist. “I’m Andréa Buer. I fly for Williams Power. Have you got a telephone I can use?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I’m very sorry, ma’am, our satellite phones are for military use only. It’s hit-and-miss now anyway. This is a command —”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Even if it’s to call Hunt Williams? To get you another generator up here?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Two minutes later, Andréa’s call went through.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Hello?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Mr. Williams, it’s Andréa.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Andréa! Where are you? Are you alright? How’s Everon?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“We’re fine. We took off from Kennedy about an hour before the bomb went off. We’re back at Teterboro Airport now.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“This is the first call I — I didn’t think this sat phone was working, Andréa.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I’m on a military phone, Mr. Williams. They say it’s intermittent. Apparently some of the satellites that were overhead at the time of the blast have moved on around the globe.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“It’s horrible down here, Andréa. I’ve got four million people without power. The whole system is down. Control systems, substations . . .” — the connection faded out — “. . . actually got melted power lines. I don’t know how many of our engineers and technicians . . . at that damned New York conference. I’m very relieved to hear your voice.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">It sounded like her boss was nearly crying.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Can you get Everon to the phone?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“He’s gone into the city, Mr. Williams.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“What!</span> Isn’t that where the bomb went off?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Yes,” she grumbled.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Why the hell did you let him —”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I don’t think anyone can stop Everon Student from doing anything,” she said with irritation. “He and his brother went in to see if they can find their sister. Everon was able to get ahold of an old Coast Guard helicopter and they took off about an hour ago on a Red Cross mission. I think they’re planning to search on the Upper East Side, a good distance north of the blast site.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The line went silent.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Mr. Williams? <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Sir?”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I’m desperate for crew people, Andréa. I need to talk with him as soon as he returns.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I don’t know if I’ll have access to this phone later, sir.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Alright, I’m coming up there. I’ve got Tally. He can fly me.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“They aren’t letting anyone fly anywhere near here without special permission from the military. Um, the Army needs generators though.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The phone went silent again. “Let me speak with someone in charge.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Hold on.” She turned. “Colonel Marsh?” She handed him the phone. “Hunt Williams.”</p>

</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">Hunt Williams finished</span> his satellite phone conversation with Colonel Marsh and stared into the dimly lit Williams Power control room at Juniata. One small gas generator chugged outside.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Every single one of the giant Williams generators was shut down. All of them probably damaged. Thousands of homes and businesses without power, shut down by the bomb’s electro-magnetic pulse that had traveled train tracks and power lines out of the New York area. The whole U.S. grid in Hunt’s part of Pennsylvania was dead. There wouldn’t be any outside power to restart the Williams system.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He had strong reservations about handing one of their only three spare generators over to the military. Until they were able — make that <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">if</span> they were able — to restart one of the big Williams coal units, the Williams system was crippled.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The company’s problem was personnel. There was only one thing to do.</p>
