<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre5">“Why are we</span> doing this?” Everon asked, hands, triceps straining. “She’s not gonna be down there, you know.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“We don’t know that!” But it was only his own desperation Franklin heard.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Fifteen feet from the first hole, Franklin and Everon struggled to push over a vertical slab of concrete-bonded asphalt the size of a flat panel television.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">As the slab began to move, a breath of air fluttered along the ditch, lifted Everon’s wavy blond hair. “That radiation cloud’s coming,” he grunted. The asphalt’s black upper edge went past vertical, rotating as if encased in glue. “Think of a desert storm. Then realize each grain of sand is poison. A poison once inside, your body can’t ever get rid of.” The slab accelerated as gravity took over until it fell, crashing onto the dirt on the other side of the subway.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Dirt flew as they began a new hole. Franklin knew it. They didn’t have to do this. They could stop now. “When she left you at the airport, was she taking a cab — or a train?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I left her <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">in</span> a cab.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">More bricks tossed into the ditch. The train was deeper here. As they dug down, yellow, blue, white tiles were part of the mix.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What was Cynthia planning to do?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Go home to her family, watch TV and go to <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">bed.”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">They exposed the upper part of a window; its lower edge, buried in the dirt, became visible. Another narrow one they’d overshot. But this one had no horizontal split. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Tight, but possible.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">As they dug out more dirt and debris, the face of a white-haired old man appeared. “Get back!” Franklin yelled at him.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The face in the window disappeared.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin pulled a small rock hammer from his climbing belt and smacked the glass. It didn’t break. He hauled back. And smacked the hell out of it. The glass shattered with a loud crash.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He felt a faint breeze from the window as he used the hammer’s handle to scrape away shards around the edge. It wouldn’t do to rip his skin open on the way in.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">With one hand on the climbing rope, he flipped himself around and slid his legs over. As his chest scraped through, he felt hands lightly grip his feet and guide him inside — moving his feet sideways to where his toes found something hard to stand on.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">And something cold, too.</p>
<div class="calibre1">

<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">Faces stared back</span> at him in his flashlight beam.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Part of him felt like he’d made a terrible mistake, wasting so much time. Cynthia’s face was not among them.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The group was smaller than he expected, five men and two women, gathered at the high end of the car, standing, sitting, holding onto silver poles. As if to anchor themselves. Cold was leaking into his climbing shoes. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Water!</span> Already an inch over the orange plastic seat he stood on.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The odor was strong — salt, and the faint smell of ripe sewage. A swollen male body floated in the water, a man in a soggy dark business suit.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Are we ever glad to see you, son!” said the man with short white hair Franklin had seen in the window. Blood was smeared across his scalp. He wore an expensive disheveled topcoat and suit. “What happened?” he asked. He bore a calm, kind look on his face. His eyes held wisdom.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Before Franklin could answer, someone else asked, “Where is everybody?” Another voice: <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“You’re it?”</span> And then they let loose: “The next car’s — We’ve been here — flooded — Are you — for hours — with the — Train crash? — city . . .”</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">They have a way out now,</span> a voice inside Franklin said<span class="c_span_body-char-italic">. Let these people find their own way off Manhattan. Get to the helicopter. Try again for the top of Cynthia’s building!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">But he had to tell them: “The City’s been bombed.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">There were gasps. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“I knew it.” “Bombed! What do you mean bombed?” “A bomb!” “Oh my God!” “Bomba! Bomba!”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What kind of bomb?” one man’s high voice penetrated, a dark damp toupee half off his head. He was nearly screaming. “What kind of bomb could affect us all the way up here if —” the high-pitched sound froze. His eyes went wide. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Nuclear?”</span> he did scream.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin gave him a firm look. “We think so. Down by the seaport.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">People gasped. The screamer shut up.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">In the flashlight’s beam Franklin caught two more corpses, a man and a woman floating at the car’s end. The woman’s dark skirt floated up around her white jacket, their faces already bloated by gas. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Water’s about four feet high already,</span> he judged. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Coming in pretty fast.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What about radiation?” asked a guy with piercing black obsidian eyes and skin, a green ball cap, the words <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">StreetNews!</span> hand-painted on the front in white.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Our meter isn’t showing a problem so far around here. My brother’s on the roof with ropes,” Franklin pointed. “We have a helicopter. We can get you out of the city.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I knew it!” said a very dark-skinned man, shaking his head. He had high cheekbones, a dark, bushy mustache, an orange and white New York Transit vest over a blue shirt. “I was up front in the motor when we came off the tracks. We were nearly into Lex and 59th. Wasn’t going that fast.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“You’re the engineer?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“This is everybody?” Franklin disconnected his harness, stepped out of it. “This is the first car?” The cold water had filled his climbing shoes, was rising up his ankles.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I put the train in service ten minutes before it hit,” the engineer answered. “Just an eight car hookup.” He pointed down the far end, “I — I couldn’t open the door — I have the key — the water . . .” his voice trailed off.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Got to our car maybe an hour ago,” the old man said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin stepped from one seat to the next, grabbing silver overhead handles for balance.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“You <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">don’t want to LOOK AT THAT!”</span> the engineer’s voice rose in volume as Franklin swung his beam.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Light hit the window at car’s end. Franklin jerked involuntarily as a face stared back, sightless open eyes through the tall rectangular glass in the car on the other side.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Halfway up the door, water was leaking through a seal that was holding back a flood. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Everyone in there has to be dead. Probably drowned when the subway tunnel collapsed and flooded. Not long after the bomb went off.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">He flashed the beam downward and perceived ripples in the light, a moving current.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Water coming in from more than one place too.</span></p>
