<p class="p_body_para">The newspaper guy cradled the winch in place as Everon reattached it to its tubular support arms above the Pelican’s cargo door. Everon hated having to take time now, not being too certain how difficult the helicopter would be to restart. But they would need the hoist to have any chance of getting Franklin on top of Cyn’s building.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Damn!” Clarence said as the green cap blew from his head. “Getting windy.” Dark kinky hair stood out in all directions, flipped back in the gusts. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">From the southeast now,</span> Everon saw. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">From the cloud.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">“How big was the bomb?” Clarence asked.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I don’t know.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Way down the avenue, thick dark slanting wisps of death, the radiation cloud and its rain were definitely moving in their direction.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“There!”</span> Everon said, <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Got it!”</span> sliding the last bolt home. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Zzzzt!</span> He quickly tightened down a nut and moved to another.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Zzzzt! Zzzzt! </span>He moved to the last nut, part of him wishing they hadn’t taken time to get these people out. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Zzzzt! What if Franklin’s right and Cyn’s up there half alive?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">“My mother’s in Brooklyn,” Clarence interrupted worriedly. “Do you know anything about Brooklyn . . .”</p>

<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">They were hustling</span> at a pretty good clip, dodging chunks of debris, smashed furniture, fly-covered corpses. But the wind was gusting now, back and forth along 59th. They’d left the battery behind. Cars were everywhere. They could always get another.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Victoria Hill rode on Franklin and the train engineer’s interlocked hands. The Russian couple, who called themselves Petre and Kat, Franklin learned, carried his larger bags. Tyner Kone trailed the others. He’d refused to carry anything.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The slightly built Walter van Patter carried the small blue bag with Franklin’s climbing harnesses. “Has the President said anything yet?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Communications are down everywhere,” Chuck huffed as he lugged his med case.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I doubt any television stations are operating,” Franklin said. “Only one radio station was on the air when we flew out of Teterboro. Everon can tell you more about electronic damage.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“My family’s in the Bronx,” the transit engineer rasped out. He was tiring now, his side of Victoria lagging up and down with every step. “Have you heard anything about the Bronx?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin shook his head.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">They were halfway up the block when the transit engineer asked, “Can we stop to rest? Just for a minute?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">An explosion rumbled ten yards behind them. A chunk of concrete slammed into the street, putting an end to the engineer’s rest idea. They pushed on. Past where the subway cave-in ended they were able to hustle still faster more in the center of the street.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Victoria studied the dark-haired man carrying her, pushing them all to go faster. Her knee was almost numb. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">How did he do it? And he speaks Russian? They don’t look much like brothers. The other one — Everon? — the wavy sun-blond hair. Certainly dresses well</span> — Beneath the mud, she’d recognized quality in the cotton diagonal running through his sturdy tan trousers — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">gabardine.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">But it was this one, <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Franklin,</span> carrying her, almost running along the street. The gray mud streaked on his black leather jacket, on his long, dark tied-back hair and face. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Tall and rangy.</span> A flutter in her stomach. Those shining cobalt-blue eyes seemed to see her as she had never been seen before.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“So you’re on a Red Cross mission?” she asked.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“No,” he huffed. “We just came in to find our sister.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“She was on the subway?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“We don’t know where she is.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Does anyone know who did this?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“No one seems to.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Despite a minor case of numb-butt, she could feel his fingers below her thighs, long and strong. She’d noticed a little dirt caked around their tips. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">From where he must have been clawing his way out of that hole. </span>But his nails were clipped close. Barely any white showing at the ends.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Why the hell am I thinking about his nails?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">She felt her face redden with embarrassment. She knew why. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">What am I doing? It’s only a you-saved-my-life attraction.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">She remembered reading somewhere that more babies were conceived around a major disaster than any other time. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">What is it about disaster that makes people think about sex?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">The helicopter came into view, blades already turning.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“We’re almost there,” Franklin urged. “Come on!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Cynthia has to be alive!</span> <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Has to be!</span> A kind of mantra he repeated with each step, clinging to uncertainty, holding tight to his fear. Grief, sadness — they meant his sister was already gone.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Fear was better. As long as he was afraid, Cynthia had to be alive.</p>
