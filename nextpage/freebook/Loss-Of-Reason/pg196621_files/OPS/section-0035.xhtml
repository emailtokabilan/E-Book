<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre5">He wasn’t sure</span> if the storm outside had calmed some. His cabin was steadier. If anything his stomach felt worse.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Ahmad Hashim rolled his face over the side of his bunk and vomited more of the viscous green and red fluid into a rusty metal bucket. He sucked down ragged gasps of air, trying to relax. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">More red than green this time. Blood,</span> he knew. The skin across his stomach, chest and shoulders was a boiling rash. He put a hand to his burning forehead.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">No!</span> He would <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">not</span> do it again<span class="c_span_body-char-italic">. So many dead. So many brothers and sisters. Why was it only the Jews Allah told the killing of one innocent man was as the killing of the entire world? Why have I done this thing? No amount of money is worth this guilt, this pain.</span> He had made a terrible choice and Allah had made this sickness his price.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Ahmad closed his eyes and lay his dark curly hair and blistering neck back on the bunk. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">My own guilt it was that allowed such a foolish error.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">A criticality accident, </span>it was called. It seemed to be getting more difficult to — his memory seemed to be going — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">too much plutonium in too small a space . . . trying to modify the device</span> — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">the halves of the bomb’s core in too close proximity with one another . . . radiation filling the lab. Shooting through the walls . . . </span>anyone within twenty feet in all directions would be as he was now.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Hashim had been the only one. Except for the bird, of course.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The lab shared a wall with the Evil One’s own cabin. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Too bad the Evil One was not in there too,</span> Hashim thought viciously. Only the bird, and now Hashim’s friend Taliq had taken it. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Does the infidel even know his bird is gone? </span>Hashim certainly wasn’t going to tell him.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">His stomach rumbled, ready to release again. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Na’am — yes! Eighty, ninety miles. Certainly we are less than a hundred off the East Coast. Allah will guide me.</span> Ahmad would find someone and warn them about what was coming. He had to try. He must remove himself from this ship. If he did not receive outside medical attention he would not last another day.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He slid his feet from the bunk and forced himself unsteadily erect. Struggled into a jacket. Slid the two candy bars, a small bottle of water into his right jacket pocket. His left held the control cards.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">As he staggered to the cabin door, Ahmad slipped on the vile green slop. The doorknob caught the side of his head painfully but his hands grasped it and kept him on his feet.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">At the stairs he crawled his way up each stair, pulling himself up the railing for support . . .</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Up to the starboard side of the main deck — where the four white boats hung from their davits above the water. He looked over the side.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Norse Wind</span> was making more than fifteen knots against a five-knot wind. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Even with help, dangerous to launch at this speed. </span>He was alone and he had no choice.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Two days earlier, Ahmad had watched the transmitter men leave. The outdated lifeboat had no upper shell. Only a cloth tarp cover that looked old enough to have come off the <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Titanic</span>. When Ahmad doubted its condition, the man enthusiastically explained, <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Nothing to worry about, my friend. If need be, all is automatic. One sets the timer — we push this button here, then this one . . .”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Slow eight-foot swells rose along <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Norse Wind’s </span>side. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">They will be to my advantage,</span> Ahmad thought dully, a hacking snort erupting from his nose. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">If I live through launch.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">He set the controls for self-launch then crawled up inside. He had to get off without anyone else seeing. The Evil One, no doubt, would kill him for desertion. And sabotage.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">As the mechanism unwound, with what strength he had left, he struggled to remove the rear of the white tarp from its hooks before the boat hit the water.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The boat slapped down and Ahmad jolted forward, but the still-connected tarp caught his knees and saved him from launching into the air.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He grabbed the starboard rail and removed the aft winch cable. Pulled himself across the tarp to reach the bow hook before the next trough could yank him airborne, but the cable released itself. And he watched as the huge ship rolled away — then loomed dangerously back, inches from crushing his tiny vessel.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The gap widened. He left the front of the tarp attached. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Better to keep water out,</span> he thought. He hurried the key, surprised to hear the motor come to life on its first try. He pushed the tiller to steer away west.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">WHOOOSH,</span> a sound blasted from the ship’s hull. He looked up to see a long dark object flying from the narrow side door in the ship’s bow, land in the water and disappear.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">The second fish launched! “Oh, Allah, no!”</span></p>
