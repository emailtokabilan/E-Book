<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre15">“Where am I?”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">A glittering silver pole rose from the floor near her head. There was a dull ache in her left leg, bent strangely at the knee around a second pole — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">wasn’t I sitting on the other side of it?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">The air felt damp and dusty. Above her head, a long row of lights glowed dimly, highlighted the orange of the seat where she’d been sitting — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">what seemed like only moments before.</span> She could make out enough to remind herself of the last thing she could remember — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">I was riding in a subway car!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">What time is it? A couple more minutes we’d have been into 59th and Lex! </span>She brushed something from her eyes to read her watch. Its digital readout was blank. She tried to move. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Ye-aaahhhhhhhhhhhh!”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Her vision cleared instantly as overwhelming pain shot up her leg, snapping her to full consciousness. Victoria Hill clamped down on the scream and through gritted teeth, sucked in breaths of damp air — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">is my knee broken? </span>She held a breath and ran fingertips lightly around her kneecap, afraid to try to straighten it again. It was dry. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">No blood. Skin’s not cut — not yet. Be careful of it!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">The long car was sitting at an angle. People were jumbled around, groaning, someone crying faintly. Victoria touched her right forefinger to a cold area near her right temple and let her breath escape. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Wet, slippery — blood,</span> she thought.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The blood shocked more than scared her.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">She gripped hands around her upper thigh, trying to choke off the next wave pulsing through her knee. The worry, the mind-invading fear of further bone and tissue damage, was reinforced by shooting pain at her slightest movement.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The pain receded. She pulled her jacket collar tighter around her neck. And from the car’s end she recognized another sound. The gurgle of water pouring in.</p>
<div class="calibre1">
<div id="a__idContainer058" class="p_divider6"><span><img alt="" src="image40.jpg" class="calibre2"/></span></div>
</div>
<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre6">“Come on!” she</span> shook the white-haired man.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">His eyes opened and he smiled faintly. There was wet blood matted in his hair. “Hi. My name’s Victoria. We’ve got to move up to the other end. The water’s getting higher.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I know who you are, Miss Hill. I’ve seen you on TV before.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">A dark-skinned man in a baseball cap with <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">StreetNews!</span> on the front, and another man who spoke no English, pulled her up, while the transit engineer helped the old man. Arms across their shoulders, she hobbled on her one good leg. The screaming pain rolled up in waves: calf-knee-thigh-pelvis-calf — almost more than she could bear.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">They eased her onto one of the plastic seats in the upper third of the car.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I normally wouldn’t do this —” the guy in the green baseball cap muttered, “I have to buy these but —” He pulled out several folded newspapers from a large black bag.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Ahhhh,</span> thank you,” she said as he eased them gently beneath her knee.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I don’t expect to have a lot of customers right now,” he said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">She spotted her black purse floating in the dark water. “Look in there, will you? There should be a couple of twenties. My phone too.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">But he didn’t go for the purse. “That’s <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">okay,</span> lady,” he said, an uncomfortable stress in his voice. And then she realized the half-submerged lump floating nearby was a body, a gas-bloated man in a dark suit.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“We can’t just sit here waiting for the water to take us,” Victoria told the others. There were six of them. The only other woman was shaking her head, pointing at her cellphone, speaking to the man with her in a language Victoria didn’t recognize.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Someone will come for us soon!” said a portly man with a high, annoying voice.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“But <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">how soon,</span> man?” said the newspaper vendor. “Before the water rises over our heads?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What about opening the front door by your compartment up there?” Victoria pointed. “Maybe we can walk up the tunnel. If you —”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The engineer shook his head. “Cave-in, lady. I can’t tell how much of the tunnel’s blocked that way. My flashlight’s dead. We’re safer in here.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">They turned back to the rising water, already inches higher in the minute or so they’d spent debating.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">I wish I could look for myself,</span> she thought. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">I need something to bind my knee. </span>She looked at the newspapers. Her scarf. The lining of her coat. “Does anyone have a knife?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The newspaper vendor had a knife.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">She talked him out of a couple more newspapers from which she rolled tight paper tubes on a diagonal three pages thick. Using them like splints, she tied off four above and below her knee with strips of scarf and coat lining. She probably still couldn’t walk on her own, but it did feel better.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Something cold licked Victoria’s heel and she jerked her swollen leg away. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Water! Already?</span> The pain shot right into her pelvis. She gritted her teeth, clamping hands around her thigh again. Not quite as bad. The splints were helping. They’d work for a while. Until they got wet.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">She pulled herself up on one of the train’s vertical steel hand poles and slowly worked her way to the train’s front door. It was locked. She peered through the glass. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">The engineer’s right. You can’t see anything.</span> She turned to see him watching her. They were all watching her.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Do you have the key?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I don’t know if we should —”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I know we shouldn’t!” the high-pitched guy interrupted the engineer.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">She held out her hand insistently, waiting, until the transit engineer produced a silver key from his pocket, stepped around her and thrust it into the lock.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The door slid back with a <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">whooosh! </span>A breeze flowed. And another sound. Behind them. Water pouring in. Fast. The door had been acting as an airlock. Now there was nothing to hold the water back. And just outside, a wall of dirt.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Close it! Close it!” the portly man screamed as the transit engineer thrust the door closed and locked it again.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The breeze was gone. But the water in those few moments had risen a good six inches higher up the low end of the car.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Well I guess we know not to try that again,” said the engineer.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Sorry,” she said.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Don’t be sorry,” said the old man. “It was a good idea.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Yeah,” said the news vendor. “But how the hell they gonna get us out?”</p>
