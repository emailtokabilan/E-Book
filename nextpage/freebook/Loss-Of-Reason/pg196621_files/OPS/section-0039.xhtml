<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre5">Of the people</span> running toward the helicopter, Franklin spotted several hauling video cameras. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Photographers and reporters.</span> The rest, wearing pale hospital greens, carried stretchers, pushed wheelchairs. They helped Walter van Patter, now conscious again, into one; Victoria Hill into another.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Which one of you’s a doctor?” Kone whined indignantly. “I feel like I’m ready to fall over, after everything <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">I’ve</span> been through!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">The wind was calm in New Jersey, Franklin noticed. Just as it had been at the fountain minutes before it changed directions. The black cigar-shaped cloud jutted out.<span class="c_span_body-char-italic"> Has it reached the river? How much time does it leave us to get out?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Everon pulled one of the medic’s collapsible stretcher dollies next to the cargo door. Franklin got to his feet with Melissa. His jacket halfway open, the owl poked its head out between his white shirt’s middle two buttons again. A photographer snapped a picture. The flash scared the bird back inside.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“You have an <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">owl</span> in there!” a reporter pointed.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“I found him on top of an apartment building,” Franklin muttered.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“We should call him Harry!” Victoria spoke up. “In honor of our narrow escape.” She pointed to Melissa. “Harry helped find this little girl!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Flashes flashed. Video cameras recorded. Vandersommen, that same jerk airport security guard who nearly stopped them going into the city, emerged from the crowd. Before he could say anything, Everon said, “Emergency landing. Lost both engines. No choice.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“You had no authorization in the first place.” Vandersommen wrote something in a small notebook, while looking at the Pelican’s tail number.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">An Army major ran over followed by two of his men. “We’re commandeering this helicopter!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Go ahead!” Everon barked. He jumped down from the big cargo door. With Chuck’s help, they began to wrestle the Aztec cocoon out onto the dolly.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin heard someone shout, “Victoria!” One of the reporters apparently knew her. He pushed a microphone to her face. Clarence nudged behind Victoria’s chair, freeing the woman in green scrubs.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“We better hustle,” Everon said as he and Chuck passed alongside with the Aztec cocoon. “Look!” he head-pointed. The dark cloud looked to be completely across the Hudson. “By the time that gets here we better be long gone! Meet you at the jet, Bro!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Before anyone could thank them, Everon and Chuck pushed ahead.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“You were rescued by these men, Ms. Hill?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“They pulled us out of a collapsed subway. They’re amazing.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“And these EMS personnel are from where?” another reporter asked.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“They’re brothers,” Clarence cut in. “The pilot’s from Vegas.” He pointed at Franklin. “He’s a Congregational minister.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“A <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">what?”</span> Victoria looked at Franklin, as surprised as the reporter.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“The big guy told me,” Clarence nodded at Chuck, pointed back at Franklin. “The dark-haired one is <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Reverend</span> Franklin Reveal. The blond surfer guy’s the pilot, Everon Student. They saved us — and about three hundred thousand other people.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“How’s <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">that?”</span> the reporter asked. “Three hundred <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">thousand — ?”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin walked faster.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Be ready to expect a <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">lot</span> more survivors in about an hour!” the transit engineer put in. “They set thousands free when they opened a path on top of the GW.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Communications must be out,</span> Franklin realized. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Nobody even knows what’s happening.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">He passed soldiers adding to a row of tall green and white toilets. One woman lined up said to another behind her, “I just hate these porta-things, don’t you?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Through the nearest tent’s entrance, Franklin saw people crammed on ankle-high cots. Doctors and nurses clearly past overload, bandaging foreheads, arms, legs. Selecting who would live, and who could not be helped, who would die. Franklin thought of the mob coming from the bridge.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">People were crying, screaming, searching for the ones they’d lost. As if someone had torn away the reality in which they’d lived. The world was upside down, where nothing made any sense at all.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Yea, <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">brother!”</span> shouted a homeless vagrant in tattered clothes and cutoff gloves, voice rising like an old-time revivalist. “The end of days is come!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Mania was taking over.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">An elderly bleached-blonde stepped in Franklin’s way. A camel-shaped brown stain ran across the bottom of her long torn skirt. Her right hand parallel with the ground just above her head, she asked, “White-hair, about this tall — have you seen my husband? They said they would bring him on the next helicopter . . .” her thick Jewish-Brooklyn accent trailed off.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“No, I’m sorry,” Franklin answered.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">She wandered away screaming violently, “WHO HAS <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">DONE</span> THIS!”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">No one told her to be quiet. It was the same question they were all asking. There was no victim list you could check to see if someone you cared about was on it. He doubted there ever could be such a list. There were so many like her. People who seemed not to know where they were or what they were doing. Only that something important had been taken from their lives. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Oh, please God . . .”</span> voices trailed off nearby. A total loss of reason.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“What was it like over there?” a female reporter asked, pushing a microphone into Franklin’s face.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He stepped around her.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Franklin had no desire to talk about the city. He didn’t want to hate Vandersommen or this reporter or anybody. The only person he hated was someone he couldn’t see or touch or find. Someone who had set off a bomb that had caused fire and agony and so much pain.</p>
