<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre5">Clarence, the Russian</span> and the transit engineer pulled the heavy hook and most of its cable back into the Pelican, tying them with a piece of climbing rope to one of the bench seat supports along the side. They closed the cargo door as far as the lift harness would allow and the freezing wind dropped to a light roar.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Cradled in Franklin’s arms, Melissa wiggled, a secret smile on her face. Fine blonde hair like Cynthia’s. She acted as though she were safe, the most comfortable baby in the world. How long had she been wearing that same night outfit? <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">More than sixteen hours,</span> he guessed. He could smell something going on in there. Not much he could do about <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">that</span> right now. He worried why she hadn’t complained about not being fed for what must have been, <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">what? More than twelve hours?</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">Since he’d taken her from the cabinet, the only time she cried was when he tried to have someone else hold her. He would only need a moment to reach inside his shirt and pull out the bird. But Melissa would go wild. He felt another brief scamper, claws against his skin. The bird had ducked back inside and it wouldn’t come out either. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Wish I could get it out of my shirt.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">As they cleared the Hudson River cliffs re-entering New Jersey, Everon breathed a little easier. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">At least I won’t have to make a water landing. </span>He could set them down in any open field, if he had to, even a golf course, a parking lot.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Noise was increasing, the <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">left</span> turbine’s tachometer needle this time pegging into the red. He knew what <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">that</span> meant — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">governor’s failing to the high side — a runaway engine. If there isn’t smoke trailing us yet, there will be soon.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">He didn’t want to do it — He grabbed the left turbine lever and slid it back to MANUAL. There was no effect. He took a deep breath. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">No choice at all now.</span> He couldn’t just wait for the right engine to self-destruct. Still, he hesitated, calculating quickly — <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">thirteen passengers. Burned off a lot of fuel. Nowhere near overload. Still have one engine.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">He reached over, slid the left turbine control to OFF and cut its boost pumps. Immediately the Pelican began to sink as the right turbine spun down. He compensated by increasing pressure on the collective, pushing the right turbine harder, forcing the helicopter to hold altitude.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">In the distance he spotted the eight-story red-brick Med Center, north of the airport. He’d seen their heliport marked on a map. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Probably less than three miles,</span> he guessed. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Still one good engine.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">He adjusted the radio frequency. “Helicopter Pelican Two-Two-Bravo-India, emergency approach for Hackensack Med Center Roof Top Heliport.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He waited. There was no answer. “Med Center Heliport, do you read?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">As the red-brick building moved closer he could make out another chopper still sitting on the roof! Its blades weren’t even turning!</p>
<p class="p_body_para">A voice came back to him. “Uh — Bravo-India we read, we’re closing except to Teterboro high-risk patient transfers. Delay several minutes.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">He couldn’t delay even one minute. Everon veered for the airport.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Much of the space around the runways was occupied by tents. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Must be an awful lot of casualties coming in. </span>Then he noticed he’d been unconsciously raising his left arm and the Pelican’s collective with it. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Losing power?”</span> he blurted. He glanced at the altimeter. “A thousand feet,” he muttered to no one in particular. They shouldn’t have been but they <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">were</span> dropping. He glanced at the engine instruments. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Shit!</span> The right turbine’s fuel filter light was on again. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">We’re going down!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">He scanned the area quickly. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">All I need is a little —</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">There was an oblong-shaped corner of the airport still open, several helicopters there already. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Can I glide it that far?</span> And then he heard that harsh, asshole voice again —</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Where are you planning to land? I hope you’re taking us directly to the hospital,” Kone yelled.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“We’re losing altitude goddammit!” Everon snarled through his teeth. “This thing’d fly a whole lot better with less weight. Care to step outside, Mr. Kone?”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Please be quiet,” Franklin whispered forcefully to the little bureaucrat. “You’re not helping.”</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Perspiration dripped from Everon’s forehead. “Hold on!” he yelled and lowered the collective to the floor.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">As if the bottom dropped out, the Pelican fell. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Fast.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">No one said a word.</p>
