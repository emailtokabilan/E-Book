<p class="p_body_para_after_time"><span class="calibre5">As fear gave</span> way to sleep, the pretty Latina woman held her child where they lay on the carpet. Until the dim gray light filtered through the front window. And now Cheri remembered:</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Cheri Enriquez’s house shook.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Mommy!”</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">The roaring wave of pressure had cut off Stevie Wonder on the stereo, singing to the penalties of superstition. Pounded Cheri and her three-year-old Johnny down to the floor. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“Mommy!”</span> he’d cried again as they held onto each other, rocking together on the carpet, eyes closed — waiting for the scary hurricane sound to pass.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">As quickly as it began, the howling noise dropped off until it was replaced by a dead and eerie silence.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">For the longest time Cheri had been afraid to move.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">She looked at the small boy in her arms. His eyes stared silently up at her. He was awake now too.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">She rose and carried Johnny to look out the front window. The sky over east Brooklyn was so dark she could barely make out the tree-lined street. Something overhead was blotting out the light.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">She tried the news. The television screen stared back blankly. She lifted the phone. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Nothing.</span> She played with the dial on their portable radio. Only static.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Cheri had gone along with her husband Jáime’s wishes: “Better to bring Johnny up away from gangs and drugs!” And for three years they had saved every spare dollar for a deposit. Until they were able to move to the mainly Jewish area of southeast Brooklyn. Today she wished they still lived in the old neighborhood. Where she knew everybody. Where she could still go next door to the Gonzalezes or across the street to find out what Francie Lopez knew.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Jáime would know what to do.</span> But Jáime had taken that job working construction with his cousin in California. When he called last night, things were going so well. He was sending money home again. <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Oh, why did he have to go? He should be here!</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">As she held on, rocking Johnny in her arms, the raw, twisting knot grew in her stomach. A feeling that she would never see Jáime again.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">She set Johnny down and got him bundled in his winter jacket and hat and they went outside into the dim light.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">“Look, Mommy, more snow!” Johnny exclaimed happily. It was cold out, and the ground was covered with a light fresh dusting.</p>
<p class="p_body_para">Cheri looked around. Something was wrong.<span class="c_span_body-char-italic"> Snow? It looks so dark.</span></p>
<p class="p_body_para">When she touched a glove to it then touched the white-gray stuff to her face, it wasn’t cold. And before she could stop him, her little boy had lifted a finger to his lips.</p>
<p class="p_body_para"><span class="c_span_body-char-italic">“No!”</span> she shouted, slapping Johnny’s hand away, scared, hugging him to her. “You didn’t eat any of that, did you? <span class="c_span_body-char-italic">Did you, Johnny?”</span></p>
