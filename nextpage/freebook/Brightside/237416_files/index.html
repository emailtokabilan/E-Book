<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	ONE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">THEY	CALL	US	THOUGHT	Thieves,	but	it’s	not	like	we	have	a	choice.	All	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sick,	twisted	things	rolling	around	in	people’s	heads,	we	can’t	help	but	hear.	God knows	I’ve	tried	to	turn	it	off.	The	sexual	perversions,	the	violent	fantasies	about your	 boss,	 that	 annoying	 neighbor	 you	 want	 dead,	 even	 those	 unfortunate thoughts	about	your	kids.	I’ve	had	to	stand	there	and	listen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	never	wish	this	upon	anyone,	not	even	my	mom,	the	woman	who’s	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">over-sharing	since	I	slid	from	her	womb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	wouldn’t	believe	the	awful	shit	I’ve	heard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imagine	if	you	knew	every	dark	thought	people	had	about	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trust	 me,	 it’s	 not	 pleasant.	 In	 any	 given	 moment,	 the	 person	 you	 love	 is thinking	 about	 someone	 else	 she’d	 like	 to	 screw,	 how	 fat	 you’ve	 gotten,	 how unbearable	it	is	to	hear	you	chew.	Later,	she’ll	hold	you	and	kiss	you	and	regret most	of	it,	and	you’ll	fall	asleep	hating	yourself	for	having	all	the	same	thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Secrets	keep	the	world	from	burning.	I	know	this	now	more	than	ever.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">secret	I	have	left	could	get	everyone	killed.	One	person’s	already	dead,	more	are sure	to	follow.	All	because	I	couldn’t	keep	my	stupid	thoughts	shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 I	 understand	 why	 they	 rounded	 us	 up,	 Thought	 Thieves	 like	 me,	 and took	 us	 to	 this	 little	 town	 on	 top	 of	 a	 mountain	 with	 drops	 so	 steep	 there’s	 no need	 for	 a	 fence.	 It	 keeps	 the	 country	 functioning,	 lets	 everyone	 feel	 safe, knowing	we’re	up	here	in	the	sky,	far	away	from	everyone’s	thoughts,	except	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 call	 our	 town	 Brightside	 because,	 as	 they	 like	 to	 remind	 us,	 things could	be	worse.	Some	Thought	Thieves	weren’t	so	lucky.	They	were	beaten	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">hanged,	 shot	 in	 the	 streets.	 Others	 were	 wrapped	 in	 straightjackets	 and	 locked away	in	squishy-walled	rooms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brightside	 was	 our	 chance	 to	 start	 over.	 We	 could	 hold	 jobs	 and	 have apartments;	we	could	even	go	on	dates	and	shop	in	the	little	stores.	It	wouldn’t be	so	bad,	they	told	us.	As	long	as	we	never	tried	to	leave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 now	 it’s	 Day	 100,	 the	 day	 it’s	 all	 going	 to	 end.	 Guess	 we’ll	 find	 out how	bad	it	can	get. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 bedroom	 window’s	 right	 in	 front	 of	 me,	 but	 I’ve	 got	 my	 eyes	 closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	warm	glow	of	the	sunrise	is	trying	to	make	me	peek,	but	I	can’t	look	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">jagged	 crack	 running	 down	 the	 center	 of	 the	 glass.	 I	 can’t	 look	 at	 the	 pool	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a><img src="index-7_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">blood	on	the	chair,	the	tiny	drops	on	the	ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eight	 pounds	 of	 power	 rest	 across	 my	 thighs.	 My	 Mossberg	 12-gauge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">American	metal.	Dad’s	special	gift. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Odds	are	this	is	my	last	sunrise.	I	open	my	eyes,	take	in	the	absolute	beauty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wonder	if	Danny	and	Sara	are	awake	and	seeing	it,	too.	If	I	can	somehow	help</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	escape,	it	might	make	up	for	some	of	the	things	I’ve	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	Rachel,	though.	What	happened	with	her	is	beyond	redemption;	I	can’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">go	back	and	change	it.	If	I’d	just	given	her	what	she	needed,	told	her	what	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted	to	hear,	she’d	be	coming	with	us.	I	know	what	happened	to	Rachel	goes</p>
<p class="calibre1">beyond	Day	39,	but	that’s	when	it	all	started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IT	WAS	SEVEN	HOURS	before	Day	39	officially	began.	Rachel	and	I	were	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	office,	the	only	one	with	two	desks.	They	put	us	there	because	of	our	shitty sales	 record.	 Jobs	 in	 Brightside	 were	 based	 on	 the	 ones	 we	 held	 in	 our	 former lives.	I	used	to	sell	BMWs.	Here,	I	sold	timeshares.	At	BMW	I	never	missed	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">quota,	 never	 blew	 a	 sale,	 but	 I	 was	 always	 within	 six	 feet	 of	 the	 customer,	 the range	 I	 needed	 to	 hear	 someone’s	 thoughts.	 On	 the	 phone,	 I	 was	 next	 to worthless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	clock	on	the	wall	showed	the	same	time	as	my	computer.	All	the	clocks</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	Brightside	were	perfectly	in	sync.	No	reason	to	be	late.	No	reason	to	think	this wasn’t	all	perfectly	normal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	even	hid	the	security	cameras	to	help	us	relax.	They	put	them	inside</p>
<p class="calibre1">light	fixtures,	behind	bushes	in	the	Square,	where	we	have	a	bakery,	a	bar,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">even	 an	 electronics	 store.	 All	 built	 for	 us.	 To	 make	 us	 believe	 this	 is	 just	 a regular	town,	a	place	like	any	other.	No	reason	to	ever	escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	got	hung	up	on	before	she	could	finish	telling	the	guy	how	close	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">condo	was	to	the	beach.	We	had	five	minutes	left	of	work,	enough	time	for	her	to make	another	call,	but	she	just	opened	the	bottom	desk	drawer	and	pulled	out	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bottle	 of	 lotion.	 She	 squirted	 it	 onto	 her	 palm	 and	 rubbed	 her	 legs	 that	 were spilling	out	from	under	the	desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	 and	 I	 had	 been	 dating	 for	 close	 to	 three	 weeks.	 Long	 enough	 for Rachel	 to	 decide	 I	 was	 the	 one.	 Long	 enough	 for	 me	 to	 give	 her	 a	 key	 to	 my place,	to	convince	myself	I	loved	her	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	 gets	 accelerated	 in	 Brightside,	 because	 you	 can’t	 lie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything’s	exposed.	Normal	couples	take	six	months	to	admit	how	they	feel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brightsiders	do	it	on	the	first	date. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	 rolled	 back	 in	 her	 chair	 and	 looked	 at	 me	 like	 I’d	 just	 said</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>something.	 It	 made	 me	 feel	 sorry	 for	 all	 the	 people	 I’d	 done	 this	 to	 over	 the years.	Taking	whatever	I	pleased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	got	up	with	a	smile	and	walked	over	to	my	desk.	Her	red	skirt	stopped</p>
<p class="calibre1">mid-thigh	and	was	tight	enough	to	be	painted	on.	She	didn’t	need	to	listen	to	my thoughts	to	know	I	liked	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 last	 couple	 days,	 Rachel	 only	 saw	 me	 at	 work,	 and	 she	 knew	 I	 was ready	 to	 break	 up	 with	 her.	 It’s	 not	 that	 things	 were	 bad.	 They	 were	 just	 too intense.	 Rachel	 was	 the	 first	 Thought	 Thief	 I’d	 ever	 been	 with.	 I	 had	 no	 idea how	 exhausting	 it	 could	 be.	 You	 can’t	 just	 say	 you’re	 tired	 or	 that	 nothing’s wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	knew	everything,	even	though	I	never	said	a	word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	why	she	sat	on	the	corner	of	my	desk,	crossed	her	legs	so	I	couldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">focus	on	my	computer	screen.	She’d	put	her	dark	hair	in	a	ponytail	so	it	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">less	Jewish.	I’d	only	thought	that	once,	but	she	never	let	it	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	 smiled	 and	 took	 off	 the	 glasses	 she	 didn’t	 need.	 The	 ones	 that looked	exactly	like	Mom’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 took	 the	 part	 of	 the	 frame	 that	 rested	 behind	 her	 ear	 and	 put	 it	 in	 her mouth.	She	sucked	on	it	a	bit	then	spoke	around	it.	“You	got	plans	tonight?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 noticed	 Rachel	 had	 gotten	 contacts,	 her	 eyes	 so	 fucking	 blue.	 Just	 like Michelle’s,	my	last	girlfriend	before	Brightside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	 turned	 her	 legs	 toward	 me.	 They	 were	 shiny	 and	 smooth	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">smelled	like	piña	colada.	“I	just	shaved,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	both	knew	I	wanted	to	feel	the	inside	of	her	thigh,	run	my	hand	up	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	 if	 she	 was	 telling	 the	 truth,	 but	 I	 just	 mumbled	 that	 they	 looked	 nice	 and powered	off	my	computer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	rubbed	her	calf	against	my	knee	until	I	looked	up	at	her.	“I	need	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	you	tonight,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 adjusted	 my	 khakis,	 pointlessly	 trying	 to	 conceal	 the	 fact	 her	 plan	 was working. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	can	go	out,”	she	said.	“Something	nice.	I’m	thinking	Oscar’s.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oscar’s	meant	a	lot	of	money,	something	I	wasn’t	making	in	Brightside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Always	staying	one	step	ahead	of	me,	Rachel	said	dinner	was	on	her.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted	 me	 to	 know	 things	 could	 be	 different.	 She	 was	 willing	 to	 change.	 It didn’t	have	to	be	so	intense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	 on,	 it’ll	 be	 fun,”	 she	 said.	 “And	 I	 don’t	 even	 need	 to	 stay	 over tonight.	Unless	you	want	me	to?”	Rachel	took	hold	of	my	collar	and	pulled	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">in,	her	red	lips	so	close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could	feel	the	security	camera	zooming	in	from	its	hiding	spot.	I	pushed</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	back	and	said,	“Fine,	we’ll	go	to	Oscar’s.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>Rachel	smiled	and	spun	off	my	desk.	She	let	me	watch	her	ass	as	she	picked up	her	purse	and	walked	out	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oscar’s	was	only	a	few	blocks	from	my	apartment	and,	even	though	I	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">dressed	and	ready,	I	waited	until	the	last	possible	minute	to	leave.	I	didn’t	want to	get	there	before	Rachel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	passed	under	the	bronze	archway	and	entered	the	park	with	its	enormous</p>
<p class="calibre1">pine	trees.	Someone	had	decorated	them	with	little	white	lights	to	make	it	look</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	a	winter	wonderland.	There	were	no	rules	about	sticking	to	the	path,	so	I	cut across	 the	 grass,	 staying	 far	 away	 from	 the	 edge	 where	 the	 mountain	 dropped off.	 A	 full	 mile,	 straight	 down.	 Heights	 threw	 my	 stomach	 around	 in	 my	 chest and	made	me	shake	like	a	little	girl.		I	passed	the	pond	and	took	deep	breaths	to clear	my	head.	The	air	was	cool,	everything	silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 Cabin	 was	 high	 up	 on	 the	 hill,	 with	 its	 big	 red	 logs	 and	 long	 bay window.	The	curtains	were	always	pulled	back,	so	we’d	see	the	residents	who’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">broken	the	rules.	Some	had	refused	to	go	to	work	or	started	fights.	A	few	had	slit their	wrists	too	shallow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 common	 room,	 a	 small	 blonde	 in	 a	 nurse’s	 uniform	 sat	 behind	 the desk	 reading	 a	 magazine.	 The	 rule-breakers	 sat	 in	 chairs,	 their	 faces	 pale,	 eyes ringed	 in	 black.	 They	 weren’t	 allowed	 to	 talk	 during	 rehabilitation.	 They	 were given	pills	to	keep	them	calm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 Cabin	 was	 the	 big	 reminder	 in	 Brightside	 that	 our	 town	 was	 still	 a prison. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	focused	my	eyes	straight,	kept	walking,	went	through	the	South	archway</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 stepped	 onto	 Main	 Street.	 The	 six	 small	 stores	 were	 dark	 and	 closed,	 but everything	else	was	lit.	Every	ten	feet,	a	lamp	post	to	wipe	out	any	shadow.	No</p>
<p class="calibre1">place	to	hide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	strolled	down	the	deserted	street	as	the	American	flag	flapped	high	above</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Square.	The	flapping	like	a	goddamn	slap	in	the	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 knew	 I	 had	 to	 clear	 my	 head.	 I	 needed	 to	 blow	 out	 all	 the	 bad	 thoughts before	I	turned	the	corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	was	waiting	for	me	on	the	bench	outside	Oscar’s.	She	was	wearing</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 fancy	 green	 dress.	 The	 one	 she’d	 worn	 under	 her	 robe	 at	 graduation.	 Back then	it	fit	perfectly.	Now,	she	had	to	suck	in.	Her	hair	was	up	in	a	French	twist, and	her	makeup	was	thick.	Especially	her	lips.	Dark	red.	Her	glasses	were	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	wanted	me	to	know	she’d	been	paying	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	realize	it	was	supposed	to	be	that	kind	of	dinner,	but	at	least	I	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	my	nice	pair	of	jeans	and	my	shirt	had	a	collar.	Rachel	didn’t	care	what	I	was wearing.	She	was	just	happy	I	showed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	her	hand	and	said,	“Let’s	go	eat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>Oscar’s	 windows	 were	 tinted	 just	 enough	 so	 you	 had	 to	 press	 your	 face against	 the	 glass	 to	 see	 the	 idiots	 paying	 thirty	 bucks	 for	 the	 same	 steak	 they could	buy	for	ten	across	the	street.	Brightside	liked	to	remind	us	we	could	still	be special. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 hostess	 was	 going	 to	 seat	 us	 in	 the	 back,	 tucked	 away	 in	 the	 corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	asked	if	we	could	sit	at	a	table.	She	knew	I	wouldn’t	break	up	with	her	in the	open.	We	sat	in	between	two	couples	silently	engaged	in	conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	 wanted	 to	 talk	 though,	 wanted	 me	 to	 feel	 this	 was	 a	 normal	 date. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	knew	I	was	thinking	about	the	Cabin	and	that	fucking	flag.	She	told	me	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">order	anything	I	wanted.	She	asked	about	my	day,	even	though	she’d	been	sitting</p>
<p class="calibre1">next	to	me	the	entire	eight	hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	steaks	arrived,	and	Rachel	kept	asking	questions,	like	the	first	concert	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">went	to	 and	 the	last	 book	 I’d	read.	 She	 was	 trying,	and	 I	 felt	like	 an	 asshole.	I answered	her	questions	and	even	asked	a	few	of	my	own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 made	 me	 think	 this	 is	 how	 our	 first	 date	 should	 have	 been.	 Not	 me sharing	how	much	I	hated	my	mom.	Rachel	sharing	what	her	uncle	did	with	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">panties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 by	 the	 time	 we’d	 finished	 dessert,	 we’d	 run	 out	 of	 things	 to	 say.	 We were	like	an	old	married	couple	after	only	three	weeks.	I	took	Rachel’s	hand	and started	 to	 have	 the	 talk	 we’d	 been	 avoiding.	 She	 put	 her	 other	 hand	 on	 top	 of mine	like	it	was	a	game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	just	grab	a	drink.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	knew	I	wasn’t	a	drinker.	It’s	not	that	I	have	a	problem	with	booze.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">problem	is	when	I’m	buzzed	I	start	thinking	about	shit	I	shouldn’t.	Back	home	in Ohio,	I	could	get	away	with	it.	In	Brightside	it	was	a	problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	“It’s	kind	of	late.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	snorted.	That’s	how	she	laughed.	“We’ll	only	have	one.”	She	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	desperate	sitting	there,	her	hand	squeezing	mine.	She	just	wanted	us	to	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	fun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,”	I	said,	“we’ll	go	for	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 crossed	 through	 the	 Square	 and	 headed	 for	 Riley’s,	 the	 bar	 where</p>
<p class="calibre1">everyone	knows	your	name	and	all	the	horrifying	shit	that	fills	your	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 started	 out	 fine	 because	 that’s	 how	 bars	 usually	 start	 out.	 Then	 an	 hour turned	 to	 two	 and	 I	 was	 somehow	 on	 my	 sixth	 Jack.	 All	 my	 thoughts	 started creeping	out	like	cockroaches.	Rachel	handed	me	another	shot.	I	talked	louder	to keep	 other	 things	 to	 myself,	 but	 some	 guy	 asked	 what	 I	 had	 against	 the	 flag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	laughed	and	pulled	me	towards	the	door.	Everything	was	spinning	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	I	might	fall	over.	Rachel	kissed	me	and	kissed	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	it	was	Day	39. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>I	 woke	 up	 to	 the	 darkness.	 The	 curtains	 were	 closed.	 I	 had	 no	 idea	 what time	 it	 was	 or	 how	 we’d	 gotten	 back	 to	 my	 place.	 Besides	 the	 pounding headache	 it	 seemed	 like	 every	 other	 morning	 with	 Rachel,	 but	 something	 was definitely	wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	was	sitting	on	the	edge	of	the	bed,	legs	dangling	over	the	side.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">kept	 pulling	 at	 her	 curls,	 over	 and	 over,	 again	 and	 again.	 Her	 right	 hand	 was clenched,	her	fingers	pressing	down	on	her	thumb	like	she	was	trying	to	break	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	put	my	head	back	on	the	pillow,	tired	and	hungover.	I	was	still	halfway	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	dream,	and	it	was	a	good	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Michelle	and	I	were	walking	in	the	forest,	its	grass	so	green,	Ohio’s	brilliant</p>
<p class="calibre1">blue	sky	above.	Michelle	stopped	at	a	clearing	and	laid	down	her	red	blanket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	she	was	underneath	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	eyes	were	the	lightest	blue	with	the	softest	shine.	I	brushed	Michelle’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">sandy	 blonde	 hair	 from	 the	 side	 of	 her	 face,	 ran	 my	 thumb	 lightly	 across	 her cheek,	around	her	ear,	then	cradled	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	reached	behind	my	back	and	pulled	me	down.	My	heart	covered	hers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	heart,	my	heart,	beat	to	beat.	“Can	you	feel	that,	Joe?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	I	was	inside	her	and	we	were	white	on	red,	all	that	blue	above	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beautiful	colors	back	then. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Michelle.	Michelle.	Michelle... </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	fucking	serious?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	voice	definitely	wasn’t	Michelle’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dream	was	gone.	I	was	awake,	back	in	Brightside,	darkness	all	around</p>
<p class="calibre1">me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 had	 no	 idea	 what	 I’d	 done,	 but	 I	 knew	 it	 wasn’t	 good.	 “Come	 back	 to sleep,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	wouldn’t	face	me,	all	her	focus	on	those	curtains,	the	ones	I	refused</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	open,	the	mile	of	Brightside	beyond	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	reached	out	and	put	my	hand	on	her	back.	Rachel	recoiled	and	my	hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">fell.	Her	mouth	was	a	black	hole	moving	in	the	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	still	love	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	played	dumb,	what	Mom	wouldn’t	call	a	hard	stretch.	“Who?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	swung	her	knee	onto	the	bed	so	it	was	up	against	my	ribs,	the	thin</p>
<p class="calibre1">white	sheet	the	only	thing	between	us.	“Please	don’t	lie	to	me,	Joe.	I’m	not	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">idiot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	eyes	were	adjusting	to	the	dark.	I	saw	Rachel’s	blue	contacts,	the	black</p>
<p class="calibre1">trails	bleeding	beneath	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 took	 hold	 of	 her	 fist	 and	 eased	 it	 open.	 I	 rubbed	 her	 college	 ring,	 the emerald	 set	 in	 white	 gold.	 She’d	 gotten	 it	 a	 month	 before	 they	 brought	 her	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>Brightside.	“You’re	not	an	idiot,”	I	said.	“You’ve	got	the	ring	to	prove	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	said,	“You	think	this	is	funny?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	wasn’t	funny.	It	was	scary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 said	 I	 was	 sorry.	 “I	 shouldn’t	 have	 joked	 like	 that.”	 I	 kept	 touching	 her ring,	started	picturing	her	in	school,	lying	under	all	those	guys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel’s	hand	clenched	back	into	a	fist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 couldn’t	 control	 my	 thoughts.	 “Rachel,	 it’s	 late.”	 I	 looked	 over	 at	 the clock.	“We’ve	got	work	in	three	hours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	wish	I	was	her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 knew	 I	 couldn’t	 answer	 that.	 Not	 in	 one	 word.	 Not	 the	 one	 she	 was looking	for. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Michelle	was	the	woman	I	was	going	to	marry.	She	found	out	the	hard	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	my	secret.	She	was	there	when	they	took	me	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	 sat	 waiting	 for	 an	 answer,	 staring	 at	 me,	 peering	 inside.	 I	 took	 a deep	breath,	trying	to	clear	my	head,	but	she	knew	everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	always	did	in	Brightside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	asked	if	she	was	hungry,	mentioned	the	diner,	some	eggs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	just	sat	there.	She	needed	me	to	say	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	couldn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	 reached	 over	 and	 grabbed	 my	 dick	 poking	 up	 under	 the	 sheet.	 My hard-on	was	news	to	me,	but	the	proof	she	needed	was	in	her	hand.	It	looked	like she’d	captured	the	world’s	smallest	ghost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	“Let	go.	I	have	to	piss.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	spoke	like	I	was	a	Special	Ed	student.	“How	about	you	just	wait?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	pissing	the	bed	because	you	want	to	talk.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 wasn’t	 much	 left	 of	 my	 dick	 to	 grip	 because	 getting	 treated	 like	 a child	isn’t	my	thing.	But	that	didn’t	stop	Rachel.	“You’re	not	walking	away,”	she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	hold	of	her	wrist	and	pried	off	her	fingers.	“You	need	to	stop	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	real	serious	and	slow	so	she	heard	me,	I	said,	“Fucking	relax.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Fucking	relax? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel’s	 football	 player.	 His	 words	 coming	 out	 of	 my	 mouth.	 I	 hadn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">meant	to	say	it.	Not	like	that,	at	least.	Or	had	I?	Cornered,	what	was	I	capable of? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	wasn’t	the	only	one	who	could	use	thoughts	against	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	learned	about	the	jocks,	the	Dartmouth	boys,	and	all	the	other	guys	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	second	date.	She	was	drunk	and	underneath	me.	I	thought	she	was	moaning</p>
<p class="calibre1">because	of	me,	but	then	her	thoughts	started	pouring,	flooding	her	head,	and	then mine.	 She	 realized	 what	 was	 happening,	 and	 she	 started	 crying.	 She	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>ashamed.	No	one	had	ever	seen	these	things	with	Rachel.	I	told	her	it	was	okay, that	I	didn’t	care. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 things	 considered,	 I’m	 not	 a	 bad	 guy.	 I	 don’t	 try	 to	 hurt	 people	 on purpose,	but	just	like	Rachel,	sometimes	I	can’t	let	shit	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	got	off	the	bed,	moved	to	the	other	side	of	the	room	to	get	out	of	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">range.	She	couldn’t	stomach	the	disgusting	thoughts	in	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Out	of	range,	I	could	finally	lie.	“I’m	over	Michelle.	It	was	just	a	dream.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Rachel	was	bawling.	I	sat	up	all	the	way	and	asked	her	to	please	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	to	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	wiped	at	her	tears	like	she	was	mad	at	them.	“Yeah,	you’re	over	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	proved	it	to	me,	right?	And	it	was	so	sweet.	Carving	my	name	on	a	tree.	Just like	we	were	in	junior	high.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	stupid,	something	I	did	on	Day	7.	I’d	used	my	key	to	carve	out	a	big</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart,	put	“Joe	loves	Michelle”	inside	it.	I	didn’t	think	anyone	would	see	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Brightsiders	see	everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	 and	 I	 were	 coming	 back	 to	 my	 place	 one	 night,	 and	 my	 lock	 was sticking.	I’d	damaged	the	key	by	carving	Michelle’s	name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	didn’t	say	anything,	didn’t	need	to.	I	felt	awful	though,	so	I	went	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	next	day	and	crossed	it	out,	replaced	Michelle’s	name	with	Rachel’s.	It	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">childish,	 something	 an	 eighth	 grader	 would	 do,	 but	 it	 was	 better	 than	 what Rachel	was	doing	back	then,	getting	fingerbanged	behind	the	gymnasium. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	kicked	the	bed.	She	was	back	in	range.	“You	got	something	to	say?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Fuck! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Thirty-nine	 days	 weren’t	 enough	 to	 get	 used	 to	 this.	 From	 Day	 1,	 we	 all knew	 we	 weren’t	 alone.	 They	 told	 us	 being	 together	 in	 a	 group	 would	 make	 it easier,	 but	 it	 was	 so	 much	 worse.	 Everything	 on	 display,	 nowhere	 to	 hide.	 It’s what	brought	Rachel	and	me	together.	We	thought	we	could	elevate	past	all	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dysfunctional	 relationships,	 especially	 our	 parents’,	 but	 we	 were	 even	 more dysfunctional,	all	honest	and	exposed,	the	little	secrets	and	awful	truths	firing	off like	buckshot	at	anyone	within	range. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	not	proud	of	it,	but	I	couldn’t	stop	thinking	about	the	list.	It	was	long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	the	guys	Rachel	had	been	with,	the	depths	she’d	sunk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	fucking	sick,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 the	 hell	 happened	 last	 night?	 I	 remember	 going	 to	 Riley’s	 and	 you ordering	those	shots—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	so	you’re	just	drunk?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	your	problem?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	shouldn’t	care	if	you	dream	about	her?	That	you	gotta	pretend	I’m	her	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">fuck	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>As	calm	as	I	could,	I	said,	“I	don’t	do	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel’s	jaw	clenched	so	tight	I	thought	she’d	break	teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	usually	have	a	great	memory,	one	of	the	things	I	hate	about	myself.	Not	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Day	 39.	 I	 was	 having	 trouble	 thinking,	 let	 alone	 remembering.	 The	 walk	 home was	one	big	blur. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel’s	 jaw	 relaxed.	 She	 was	 listening	 to	 my	 thoughts.	 I	 was	 trying	 to piece	things	together,	grasping	at	vapors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	smell	of	sex	was	stronger	than	my	breath,	and	I	guessed	it	was	possible</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 imagined	 Rachel	 as	 Michelle.	 But	 I	 couldn’t	 admit	 that	 and	 saying	 I	 blacked out	 wouldn’t	 change	 anything.	 I	 put	 my	 hands	 over	 my	 head,	 as	 if	 that	 would block	her	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	do	that,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	heard	her	thought:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">You’re	a	liar! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rachel,	 I	 don’t	 remember	 anything.	 If	 that	 happened,	 I’m	 sorry.	 I	 never should’ve	had	those	shots.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	it’s	all	my	fault?”	She	started	pacing,	moving	in	and	out	of	range. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Holy	shit.	Can	you	just	stop?	You’re	acting	crazy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	 smiled,	 breathed	 through	 her	 nose.	 “You	 want	 to	 see	 crazy?”	 Her voice	 scared	 the	 shit	 out	 of	 me.	 She	 was	 all	 the	 way	 on	 the	 other	 side	 of	 the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rachel,	I	know	you’re	angry.	But	you	need	to	calm	down—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	want	me	to	calm	down?	Should	I	get	some	air?	Maybe	we	should	take</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	break.	That’s	what	you	want,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Right	then	was	my	best	chance	of	denying	things,	her	by	the	door,	both	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">us	 out	 of	 range,	 lights	 off	 so	 she	 couldn’t	 look	 me	 in	 the	 eyes.	 But	 I	 knew	 we weren’t	going	to	work	no	matter	how	much	I	wanted	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	I	had	to	do	was	say	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	couldn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rachel,	come	on...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	should	I	go,	Joe?	Should	I	go	back	home?	Huh?	Oh	right,	I	can’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	is	it.”	Her	smile	was	creeping	me	out.	“This	is	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	suddenly	realized	this	was	about	so	much	more	than	Michelle.	Rachel	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">cracking,	like	a	dam	ready	to	burst. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rachel,	please,	I’m	begging—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	screamed	like	she	was	being	burned.	Her	legs	gave	out.	She	thudded</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	the	hardwood.	She	put	her	forehead	to	the	floor.	Her	tiny	fists	strangled	her matted	hair	and	she	just	kept	screaming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lights	flashed	on,	the	120s	blinding	me	even	with	the	fixture	over	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>“Rachel,	come	on,	be	quiet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 looked	 at	 the	 clock.	 We	 still	 had	 an	 hour	 before	 morning	 lights.	 They never	came	on	early. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rachel,	please!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 throat	 wouldn’t	 close,	 just	 kept	 spraying	 screams	 until	 I	 covered	 my ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	you’re	great,	Rachel.	I	wouldn’t	be	with	you	if	I	didn’t.	Just	please</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	quiet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	kept	wailing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	I	knew	they	were	coming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	 knew	 it	 too,	 but	 she	 didn’t	 seem	 to	 care,	 just	 curled	 up	 under	 the bright	 lights.	 Everything	 exposed.	 The	 scar	 on	 her	 collarbone.	 The	 two-inch wide	birthmark	on	her	lower	back.	She	banged	the	floor	with	her	head,	pleading</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	someone	to	let	her	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	just	want	to	go	home,”	she	sobbed.	“Why	won’t	they	let	us	go?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 head	 was	 pounding	 from	 the	 lights	 and	 the	 hangover,	 but	 I	 kept	 my voice	 nice	 and	 quiet	 when	 I	 said,	 “Just	 come	 to	 bed,	 okay?	 We’ll	 say	 you stubbed	your	toe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bootsteps	were	coming. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Rachel,	get	over	here	NOW! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	jumped	off	the	bed,	felt	foolish	because	my	dick	was	just	hanging	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Rachel	wasn’t	looking	at	me.	She	was	still	crying	to	the	floor,	the	voice	not her	at	all.	Broken	and	shattered.	I	yanked	her	arm,	but	she	wouldn’t	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Boots	were	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	going	to	hurt	like	hell,	but	I	had	to	get	close,	right	up	against	her	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	thoughts	would	sound	like	they	were	coming	through	a	megaphone. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">GET	UP!	THEY’RE	HERE!	PLEASE! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	made	herself	smaller,	pressed	her	fists	against	the	sides	of	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	didn’t	even	knock,	just	opened	the	door.	Two	of	them	standing	there, </p>
<p class="calibre1">all	calm,	like	they	were	here	to	fix	the	sink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	screamed,	“Fuck	you!	You	can’t	keep	us	here!	You	can’t!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	told	Rachel	to	shut	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	did,	but	only	to	spit	in	one	guy’s	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guy	didn’t	even	wipe	it	off,	just	twisted	her	arm,	almost	snapped	it.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">begged	him	to	let	her	go.	Then	she	clawed	him	in	the	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stepped	forward,	my	hands	out	to	show	them	I	wasn’t	looking	for	a	fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	had	too	much	to	drink.	Please,	don’t—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	baton	cracked	off	my	skull	and	I	fell.	The	boots	walked	right	up	to	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">face. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>“You	got	anything	else	to	say?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	kept	my	face	to	the	floor,	listened	as	they	dragged	Rachel	from	my	room, </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	TWO</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">IT	WAS	DAY	39	AND	I	was	alone	in	my	office,	just	Rachel’s	desk	to	keep	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">company.	 I	 needed	 to	 look	 busy	 and	 pretended	 to	 type,	 my	 fingers	 tapping	 out nonsensical	 strings.	 I	 drank	 cup	 after	 cup	 of	 water	 so	 I	 could	 focus	 on	 my throbbing	 bladder,	 focus	 on	 anything	 but	 Rachel,	 the	 Boots	 dragging	 her	 from my	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	computer	dinged.	A	polite	email	reminding	me	of	my	quota. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brightside	 required	 us	 to	 work.	 It	 wasn’t	 for	 the	 money.	 The	 government funded	 most	 everything.	 But	 Brightside	 needed	 us	 to	 keep	 busy,	 to	 feel productive.

<p class="calibre1">Quotas	kept	us	from	living	in	our	heads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Busy	people	don’t	kill	themselves.	That	was	the	idea,	at	least. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	started	dialing.	Got	twenty-four	hang-ups,	five	don’t-call-me-ever-agains, </p>

<p class="calibre1">thing,	like	begged	for	help	or	told	anyone	the	truth	about	this	place,	I’d	be	sitting in	the	Cabin	dripping	drool	by	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	 a	 guy	 actually	 sounded	 interested.	 I	 asked	 him	 if	 there	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">anywhere	he	dreamed	of	going. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guy	said,	“Costa	Rica.	I’ve	heard	good	things	about	that	place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	three	quick	clicks,	I	was	on	their	homepage.	“Oh,	definitely.	Costa	Rica’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">great.	Did	you	know	the	average	temperature	is	seventy-two	degrees?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	know	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	and	they’ve	got	active	volcanoes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	pretty	cool.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	 Costa	 Rica	 is	 definitely	 the	 place	 to	 go,”	 I	 said,	 “and	 we’ve	 got some	incredible	getaways	available	at	great	prices.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brightside	 had	 given	 me	 a	 sales	 script,	 which	 was	 shit,	 but	 deviation	 was against	the	rules. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	the	guy	said.	“How	much	would	it	run	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 sure	 you’d	 qualify	 for	 our	 no-down-payment	 plan.	 And	 our	 smaller</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>suites	are	under	two	hundred	a	month.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	nothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly.	Less	than	you	probably	spend	on	gas.”	I	checked	the	screen.	“Are</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	still	in	management,	Mr.	Crawford?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	home	enjoying	a	sick	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lucky	 man.	 How	 are	 your	 benefits	 over	 there?	 Do	 you	 have	 much</p>
<p class="calibre1">vacation	time	built	up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tons.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what	do	you	think?	Would	you	like	to	own	your	very	own	Costa	Rican</p>
<p class="calibre1">condo?	Doesn’t	that	sound	like	fun?”	They	told	us	to	emphasize	the	word	“fun” </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	much	as	possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	does,	but	tell	me	this.	Is	prostitution	really	legal	over	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	screen	said	Mr.	Crawford	had	a	wife	and	son,	but	that	was	none	of	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">business.	 For	 all	 I	 knew,	 he’d	 gotten	 a	 divorce.	 The	 computers	 were	 never accurate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	told	him	prostitution	was	legal	and	his	laugh	made	me	sick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would	you	be	looking	for	a	one	bedroom	or	two?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	one.	So	tell	me	more	about	this.	Are	there	brothels?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	believe	so,	now	I’ve	got	some	nice	villas	on	the	Pacific	Ocean.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	I	heard	there’s	no	age	limit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 something	 you’ll	 have	 to	 check.	 Now,	 the	 place	 is	 right	 on	 the water.	Why	don’t	we	get	the	process	started?	If	I	can	get	your	credit	card	number and	verify	a	couple	details,	we’ll	be	done	before	you	know	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	I	know	this	isn’t	some	kind	of	scam?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	question.	Goes	to	show	what	a	smart	man	you	are.	Why	don’t	I	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">email	 over	 a	 contract?	 Just	 click	 on	 the	 link	 and	 it’ll	 take	 you	 to	 our	 site. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brightside	Travel	is	a	very	reputable	company.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Holy	shit,	you’re	one	of	those	guys?	Tell	me	what	I’m	thinking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh...afraid	it	doesn’t	work	like	that.	If	you	give	me	your	email	address,	I’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">send	you	the	contract.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	door	opened	and	closed	on	Mr.	Crawford’s	end.	A	woman’s	grating	voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">said,	“Paul,	what	are	you	doing	on	the	phone?	You’re	supposed	to	be	sick.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sounding	 nothing	 like	 the	 man	 he’d	 been	 when	 she	 wasn’t	 around,	 Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crawford	said,	“I’ll	be	off	in	a	minute.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	know	if	he	was	still	listening	to	me,	but	I	kept	trying.	“Tell	her	it’s	a surprise.	 Tell	 her	 you’re	 doing	 something	 special	 for	 her,	 but	 don’t	 tell	 her what.”	 As	 quick	 as	 I	 could,	 I	 said,	 “You	 make	 this	 decision,	 and	 she’ll	 thank you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	he’d	already	hung	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a><img src="index-19_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	told	Carlos,	my	boss,	the	website’s	name	was	hurting	our	ability	to	sell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carlos	 said	 it	 reminded	 people	 Brightside	 allowed	 us	 to	 live	 productive	 lives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again,	I	told	him,	it	was	hurting	sales.	Carlos	said	the	P.R.	was	worth	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brightside	 wasn’t	 very	 profitable,	 but	 we	 only	 needed	 to	 make	 enough	 to cover	 what	 the	 government	 wouldn’t	 fund,	 like	 the	 ice	 cream	 parlor,	 movie theater,	and	electronics	store. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 this	 had	 been	 BMW,	 I	 would’ve	 had	 papers	 everywhere,	 stacks	 of	 sales contracts,	important	phone	calls	to	return. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	Brightside	desk	had	one	piece	of	paper,	a	blue	Post-It	Carlos	had	stuck</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	my	phone.	A	completely	unnecessary	reminder	of	our	three	o’clock	meeting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	 never	 worried	 about	 a	 review	 before	 Brightside,	 got	 salesman	 of	 the month	 five	 times	 in	 a	 row.	 Worst	 thing	 my	 ex-boss,	 Saul,	 ever	 said	 to	 me	 was slow	 down	 a	 little.	 Leave	 something	 for	 the	 other	 guys.	 Some	 of	 them	 have families. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here,	I	shared	an	office	because	I	sucked	so	hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	made	another	call,	but	it	just	kept	ringing.	I	stared	at	the	door,	waiting	for it	 to	 open,	 to	 see	 Rachel	 and	 that	 red	 skirt,	 her	 legs	 glistening	 with	 the	 piña colada	lotion.	The	only	thing	that	entered	the	office	all	morning	was	a	note	card, slipped	under	the	door.	It	told	me	I	had	an	appointment	with	Sharon,	Brightside’s resident	 shrink.	 Sharon	 liked	 to	 say	 there	 was	 beauty	 in	 everything.	 Look	 at	 it all.	Breathe	it	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 she	 could	 keep	 her	 fucking	 Kool-Aid.	 Self-help	 wasn’t	 going	 to	 save me.	 It	 was	 too	 late	 for	 that.	 It	 might	 have	 worked	 when	 I	 was	 a	 kid,	 when everything	started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IT	WAS	WINTER	AND	I	was	in	kindergarten,	my	very	first	day.	The	bell	rang</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 class	 began.	 Miss	 Parker	 assigned	 us	 seats.	 Corey	 thought	 I	 smelled	 like	 a girl.	Tameka	asked	to	be	moved	because	her	dad	told	her	never	to	trust	a	honky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jennie	thought	I	looked	weird	and	stupid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	all	this	before	naptime,	and	it	only	got	worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	 been	 hearing	 other	 people’s	 thoughts	 for	 a	 few	 months,	 but	 never	 this many	at	one	time.	Miss	Parker	had	told	us	to	be	quiet,	to	try	and	fall	asleep.	The ones	 who	 couldn’t	 would	 just	 lie	 there	 and	 think.	 A	 million	 voices	 blasting straight	into	my	head.	It	was	like	standing	behind	a	jet	engine.	I	covered	my	ears, mashing	my	palms	until	I	thought	I’d	crack	my	skull,	but	that’s	not	how	thoughts entered	me.	They	just	shot	in,	and	I	screamed.	Miss	Parker	ran	over,	thinking	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	having	a	nightmare.	She	saw	my	pants	covered	in	piss.	Some	kids	laughed, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>they	all	thought	I	was	a	baby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	kept	my	hands	over	my	crotch.	Miss	Parker	told	everyone	to	be	quiet.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">took	my	hand.	Her	skin	was	dry	and	scaly,	covered	in	chalk.	She	took	me	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bathroom	to	get	cleaned	up.	She	said	there	was	a	change	of	pants	in	the	teacher’s lounge.	 This	 sort	 of	 thing	 happened	 a	 lot.	 I	 remember	 my	 little	 pecker	 rubbing against	the	corduroy	because	the	school	didn’t	carry	underwear.	Miss	Parker	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	cuff	the	legs	because	they	were	too	long.	I	wondered	how	many	other	peckers</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	touched	this	zipper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	 Parker	 held	 my	 hand	 again,	 her	 skin	 cutting	 into	 mine,	 and	 we	 went back	to	class.	The	kids	were	quietly	thinking	I	was	a	retard,	except	for	Steven, probably	 the	 only	 Chinese	 kid	 in	 Columbus.	 He	 thought	 the	 other	 kids	 were jerks,	but	he	just	sat	there,	said	nothing.	I	would’ve	done	the	same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	day	finally	ended,	I	waited	for	everyone	to	leave	the	room	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">slipped	on	my	red	rain	boots	because	Mom	said	comfy	winter	ones	were	a	waste</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	money.	I	put	on	my	puffy	blue	jacket	that	was	my	Hulk	jacket	when	I	wore</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad’s	green	sweatshirt	over	it	and	growled	at	the	mirror.	I	left	my	gloves	in	my pocket	and	headed	to	the	door.	I	hoped	it	wasn’t	too	cold	out.	I	hoped	I	wouldn’t have	to	wait	long.	Mom	had	promised	she	wouldn’t	forget.	But	she	said	not	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">worry	enough	times	for	me	to	know	better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	snow	was	coming	down	hard,	the	sky	a	dark	cloud.	I	put	on	my	gloves</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	were	only	just	mittens,	the	kind	without	fingers	because	they	were	cheaper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over	 half	 the	 class	 had	 already	 been	 picked	 up,	 their	 parents	 waiting	 out front.	The	rest	of	the	kids	were	lined	up	along	the	fence	with	Miss	Parker	folding her	arms	and	hopping	up	and	down	looking	like	a	skinny	Big	Bird.	She	had	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same	puffy	yellow	hair,	too,	but	hid	most	of	it	under	her	brown	hat	with	the	giant ear-flaps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	said	it	was	the	rule	to	wait	by	the	fence,	but	there	were	kids	spilling	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	the	street.	I	headed	over	to	the	end,	squeezed	in	between	Steven	and	the	giant mound	of	snow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steven	was	dressed	for	success,	a	bright	blue	snow	coat	and	matching	vest, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 light	 blue	 button-down	 beneath	 it.	 No	 one	 had	 told	 his	 parents	 dressing	 like that	came	later	in	life.	Maybe	they	knew	Steven’s	life	would	be	a	short	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	never	looked	up	from	his	six-inch	tall	Superman,	the	strongest	man	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	planet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 had	 both	 hands	 in	 my	 jacket	 pockets,	 holding	 each	 other	 and	 my	 belly because	 the	 lining	 was	 ripped	 and	 Mom	 didn’t	 sew.	 I	 kicked	 away	 a	 circle	 of snow.	My	boots	were	too	thin	and	I	was	going	to	be	there	a	while. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steven	aimed	Superman	at	the	ground	and	thought,  <i class="calibre4">Melt	this	with	your	heat</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">vision. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>“What?”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	say	nothing,”	Steven	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	learned	to	apologize	when	I	mistakenly	thought	someone	had	said	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughts	out	loud.	People	got	angry	when	I	didn’t.	They	called	me	crazy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	night	I	prayed	for	God	to	make	it	go	away,	but	it	was	always	there, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	noise	inside	other	people’s	heads.	I	never	listened	on	purpose.	Never	reached in	 and	 stole	 people’s	 thoughts,	 like	 some	 believed.	 For	 me,	 it’s	 like	 hearing	 a person’s	true	voice,	the	things	they	really	believe.	It’s	a	whisper	from	six	feet,	a scream	at	just	inches.	The	more	focused	the	thought,	the	louder	it	gets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	know	that	silent	awkwardness	when	someone	is	holding	their	tongue, </p>
<p class="calibre1">stewing	in	anger	after	someone	does	something	awful,	because	they	don’t	want</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 cause	 a	 scene?	 Well,	 for	 me,	 it’s	 like	 being	 face-to-face	 with	 a	 wailing psychopath.	An	endless	scream	of	all	the	horrible	things	people	really	want	to	do to	each	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back	then	I	was	still	getting	used	to	it.	Part	of	me	wanted	to	turn	to	Steven</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 see	 if	 his	 lips	 were	 moving.	 The	 other	 part	 was	 smart	 enough	 to	 know	 the things	 he	 was	 thinking	 weren’t	 things	 anyone	 would	 say.	 He	 was	 pointing Superman	at	Corey,	the	kid	who	thought	I	smelled	like	a	girl	and	that	Steven	was a	fucking	chink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	started	humming	my	ABC’s,	occupying	my	mind,	blocking	Steven	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 wasn’t	 long	 before	 Brenda’s	 mom	 drove	 up.	 Then	 Darryl’s.	 Then</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jennie’s.	The	next	time	I	counted	there	were	only	five	of	us	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steven	turned	to	me	and	held	out	Superman.	Steven’s	eyes	were	so	squinted</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 could	 barely	 see	 the	 black.	 He	 was	 thinking	 he	 should	 have	 stood	 up	 for	 me after	I’d	pissed	my	pants.	“You	can	borrow	him,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 didn’t	 know	 what	 to	 say.	 I	 almost	 asked	 if	 he	 could	 hear	 my	 thoughts, because	I’d	been	watching	him	play	with	that	toy	and	wanted	it	for	myself.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	learned	that	was	a	good	way	to	get	laughed	at.	I	just	nodded	and	said	thanks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	shiny	black	Mercedes	pulled	up	to	the	gate.	Miss	Parker	called	Steven	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	real	name,	Hong,	even	though	he’d	asked	her	not	to	that	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	got	Corey	started.	Bigger	than	most	of	us	and	blacker	than	all,	he	ran</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	and	started	doing	his	gorilla	impression,	pounding	his	chest,	stomping	snow everywhere.	He	shouted,	“Hong	Kong,	Hong	Kong.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steven’s	face	got	red,	but	he	didn’t	say	a	word	about	how	he	was	going	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">jump	in	the	car	and	have	his	father	plow	right	into	Corey.	Then	Corey	slanted	his eyes	 and	 unleashed	 his	 ching-chang-ching	 talk.	 Steven	 figured	 Corey	 was jealous	of	the	car.	He	had	no	idea	Corey	was	jealous	of	the	stone-faced	woman</p>
<p class="calibre1">staring	straight	ahead	in	the	backseat.	Corey’s	mom	had	died	of	tuberculosis. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>If	I’d	been	bigger,	braver,	I	would	have	said	something	to	defend	my	very first	 friend,	 but	 I	 knew	 Corey	 would	 turn	 on	 me,	 ask	 me	 where’s	 my	 diaper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	the	cold,	my	feet	freezing	so	bad	they	might	crack,	I	had	a	warm	feeling in	my	chest	and	didn’t	want	to	ruin	it.	Soon,	Steven	was	out	the	gate,	climbing	in the	front	seat	of	the	Mercedes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	next	few	minutes,	Corey	and	the	rest	of	the	kids	were	picked	up	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">gone.	It	was	just	me	and	Superman.	The	bone-aching	cold.	Miss	Parker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	 Parker	 told	 me	 to	 stay	 where	 I	 was,	 that	 she’d	 be	 right	 back.	 I	 had nowhere	 to	 go	 and	 was	 used	 to	 waiting	 so	 that’s	 what	 I	 did.	 She	 went	 into	 the classroom	and	came	back	out	a	few	minutes	later.	Instead	of	heading	back	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">gate,	 she	 walked	 up	 to	 me,	 touched	 my	 puffy	 blue	 jacket	 and	 put	 her	 face	 real close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Parker	had	a	face	that	made	you	pay	attention.	That’s	what	Dad	said	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do.	Pay	attention	to	it.	Miss	Parker	smoked	cigarettes	when	she	was	a	kid.	She’d be	a	Miss	forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having	anyone’s	face	just	inches	away	wasn’t	easy,	but	I	didn’t	flinch.	I	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">stood	 there,	 waited	 for	 her	 to	 talk.	 I’ve	 always	 been	 shy,	 have	 a	 hard	 time looking	 people	 in	 the	 eyes,	 but	 I	 looked	 Miss	 Parker	 in	 her	 murky	 blue	 ones because	she’d	been	nice	to	me,	gave	me	the	corduroys	and	told	all	the	kids	that	if anyone	else	laughed	they’d	be	sent	to	the	principal’s	office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	 Parker	 gave	 her	 half-smile,	 spoke	 out	 the	 right	 side	 of	 her	 mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	mom	didn’t	answer,	Joey.	Is	there	another	number	I	can	call?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 shook	 my	 head	 no.	 Mom	 had	 more	 important	 things	 to	 do	 than	 worry</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	there	anyone	else	that	can	come	get	you?	Maybe	your	dad?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	 one	 called	 Dad	 when	 he	 was	 at	 work.	 I	 wouldn’t	 be	 first.	 I	 told	 Miss Parker	no,	held	Superman	tight	and	tried	to	stomp	the	cold	right	out	of	my	boots. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">This	poor	kid, </i>	Miss	Parker	thought.  <i class="calibre4">I’m	going	to	have	to	deal	with	this	for</i> <i class="calibre4">the	rest	of	the	year. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Parker	didn’t	know	what	to	do.	She’d	never	been	stuck	with	a	kid	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">long	and	never	in	the	cold.	The	cold	made	her	bones	hurt,	but	she	pretended	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	showed	her	Superman	and	pointed	at	his	S.	“He’s	made	of	steel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss	Parker	walked	me	over	to	the	gate.	“That’s	nice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	given	up	on	Mom,	but	had	an	idea.	It	wasn’t	as	cold	when	I	was	moving</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	it	was	just	four	blocks	to	my	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	blue	car	passed	by	the	gate,	went	through	the	intersection	and	pulled	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	curb	halfway	up	the	block.	Miss	Parker	had	her	back	to	it	so	I	pointed	at	the car	and	said,	“There	she	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>Miss	Parker	had	no	reason	to	doubt	me	and	was	already	thinking	about	the space	 heater	 beneath	 her	 desk.	 “Tell	 your	 mom	 she	 needs	 to	 pick	 you	 up	 right here	from	now	on.	And	tell	her	we	can’t	wait	so	long.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	both	ways	and	ran	across	the	street.	When	I	got	to	the	other	side	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">slowed	down.	I	didn’t	want	to	get	to	the	car	too	quick.	It	wasn’t	a	Buick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	fat	man	with	humongous	black	boots	pushed	himself	out	of	the	car	like	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 a	 clown	 trick.	 Miss	 Parker	 didn’t	 see	 because	 she	 was	 already	 heading inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	walked	in	front	of	me	and	stopped	all	of	a	sudden.	He	pointed	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	house	we	were	in	front	of	and	said,	“You	the	one	fucking	with	my	flowers?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	weren’t	any	flowers	where	he	was	pointing,	just	mounds	of	snow.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	smart	enough	not	to	argue	and	said,	“No,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fat	man	thought	I	was	a	little	fucking	liar	and	walked	to	his	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning	 around	 and	 running	 back	 to	 the	 classroom	 seemed	 like	 the	 smart thing	to	do.	But	it	was	just	four	blocks	and	I	knew	my	address. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 kept	 walking,	 one	 boot	 after	 another,	 even	 though	 my	 toes	 felt	 ready	 to snap	off.	Then	it	started	snowing	sideways.	I	put	my	mittens	out	in	front	of	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">face,	 scrunched	 my	 eyes	 like	 Steven’s.	 I	 crossed	 the	 street	 and	 kept	 on	 going, made	 it	 all	 the	 way	 to	 the	 next	 corner,	 where	 I	 was	 supposed	 to	 turn	 right.	 Or was	it	left? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	each	way	and	tried	to	see	the	school,	but	everything	was	the	same, </p>
<p class="calibre1">just	walls	of	white. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 I	 could	 do	 was	 guess	 so	 I	 went	 to	 the	 right,	 but	 that	 was	 really	 a	 left because	 I’d	 turned	 around	 in	 a	 half	 circle.	 The	 block	 was	 longer	 than	 I remembered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 wasn’t	 scared	 yet	 but	 I	 was	 getting	 close.	 I’d	 gone	 two	 or	 three	 more blocks	 when	 the	 snow	 finally	 stopped,	 the	 clouds	 parted,	 the	 sun	 shining,	 and that	 made	 me	 feel	 better,	 like	 maybe	 there	 was	 a	 God.	 Like	 He	 was	 actually looking	out	for	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still,	 I	 couldn’t	 tell	 where	 I	 was.	 I	 kept	 walking	 and	 walking	 but	 never crying	until	this	nice	lady	came	up	to	me	and	knelt	on	the	sidewalk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	couldn’t	see	her	face	because	my	eyes	weren’t	really	working,	everything</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	blurry	and	bright.	But	I	didn’t	have	to	see	her	eyes	to	know	they	were	nice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lady	put	both	her	hands	on	my	shoulders.	“Honey,”	she	said.	“Are	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">lost?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	trust	myself	to	speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	knew	I	was	lost	without	me	saying	a	word.	Gave	me	the	biggest	hug, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wrapping	 her	 arms	 so	 tight	 around	 me,	 tighter	 than	 I’d	 ever	 been	 held.	 “It’s going	to	be	alright,”	she	said.	“Don’t	you	cry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>I	hadn’t	even	known	I	was,	but	the	tears	were	there,	coming	down	hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lady	didn’t	stop	hugging	me.	She	didn’t	think	what	a	whiny	baby,	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	other	kids.	She	just	hugged	me	harder	and	held	me	until	I	was	all	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	know	where	you	live?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded,	sniffed	up	the	snot	pouring	out	of	my	nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	shiny	green	car	was	right	there	so	she	told	me,	“Go	ahead	and	get	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	to	the	back	door	but	she	opened	the	front,	the	place	I	never	sat	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	nice	lady	started	the	car	and	spoke	real	soft	and	called	me	Honey	ten</p>
<p class="calibre1">times	 trying	 to	 find	 out	 where	 I	 lived.	 But	 even	 though	 it	 took	 that	 long	 she never	got	mad.	She	said	how	smart	I	was	to	remember	the	address. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	we	got	to	my	house,	the	lady	looked	out	the	passenger	window.	“Is</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	where	you	live?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wanted	to	say	no.	I	wanted	her	to	drive	forever.	But	I	didn’t	want	to	lie	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said	yes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,”	she	said.	“Let’s	get	you	inside.	I’m	sure	your	mother’s	worried.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	got	out	of	the	car,	and	the	nice	lady	got	out	too.	She	put	her	hand	around</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	shoulder	and	started	down	the	path	to	the	front	porch.	“I’ll	make	sure	she’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom’s	big	old	Buick	that	she	was	dying	to	trade	in	for	something	sexy	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	driveway.	I	didn’t	recognize	the	van	parked	behind	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	 at	 five	 years	 old	 I	 knew	 what	 I	 was	 walking	 toward,	 that	 it	 wasn’t something	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	nice	lady	walked	us	up	the	three	steps,	her	hand	on	me	the	whole	way, </p>
<p class="calibre1">even	when	she	knocked	on	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	one	came	so	she	knocked	again.	“Does	your	mom	work?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said	no	and	pointed	to	the	doorbell.	The	nice	lady	pushed	it	and	we	heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	noise	inside,	fast	footsteps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	opened	halfway	and	there	she	was.	Mom	in	that	dark	green	towel</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	matched	her	eyes.	She	kept	one	arm	pinched	to	her	side	to	hold	it	up.	Her</p>
<p class="calibre1">hair	was	fire	on	that	snow-white	skin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,	I	was	in	the	shower.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 found	 him	 walking	 up	 and	 down	 our	 cul-de-sac	 on	 Cherry.”	 The	 nice lady	kept	her	hand	on	my	shoulder,	stopped	me	from	running	away.	“That’s	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">three	miles	from	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	got	to	excuse	him.”	Like	I	couldn’t	hear,	Mom	said,	“He’s	a	little</p>
<p class="calibre1">special	sometimes.	What	the	hell	were	you	thinking,	Joey?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 nice	 lady	 pointed	 at	 my	 eyes,	 the	 skin	 all	 around	 them.	 “He	 was	 out there	a	long	time,”	she	said.	“It’d	be	a	good	idea	to	put	something	on	him	right</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>away.	Maybe	get	him	to	a	doctor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	 grabbed	 my	 hand	 and	 pulled	 me	 past	 her,	 my	 face	 brushing	 against her	towel	that	reeked	of	an	over-ripe	sweetness,	something	sour	underneath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	nice	lady	said,	“Not	butter,	though.	That’ll	make	it	worse.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	smiled.	“I	know	what’s	best	for	my	son.”  <i class="calibre4">Bitch. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	nice	lady	started	to	say	something.	Mom	slammed	the	door	and	walked</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	 toward	 the	 kitchen.	 Her	 bedroom	 door	 was	 open	 and	 she	 was	 praying	 I wouldn’t	 look	 that	 way.	 At	 the	 guy	 standing	 next	 to	 the	 dresser,	 buckling	 his pants,	his	chest	all	sweaty	like	he’d	been	doing	pushups. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	saw	me	looking	and	said,	“TV	went	out	again.	That’s	why	I	couldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">leave.	 He’s	 fixing	 it.”	 She	 opened	 the	 fridge,	 took	 out	 the	 tub	 of	 butter.	 That yellow	tub	was	shaking,	something	Mom	never	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wanted	to	back	up,	to	get	away	from	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	held	me	there	and	said,	“Damn	it,	Joey,	stay	still.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	 was	 really	 worried.	 Worried	 and	 ashamed.	 She	 couldn’t	 care	 less</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	how	she’d	forgotten	to	pick	me	up.	She	was	feeling	bad	about	what	she’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">done	in	her	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	stuck	one	hand	into	the	tub,	the	same	stuff	that’d	been	good	enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 her	 growing	 up.	 With	 a	 huge	 scoop	 of	 butter	 globbed	 in	 each	 hand,	 Mom said,	“I	need	you	to	promise	me	something.	Can	you	keep	a	secret?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	the	one	thing	I	was	good	at.	Knowing	people’s	secrets.	Acting	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	slabbed	the	cold	butter	on	my	tingling	cheeks.	“Not	a	word,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 spread	 the	 butter	 across	 my	 face,	 wasn’t	 all	 that	 careful	 around	 my	 eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	about	any	of	this.	You	can	do	that,	can’t	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	exactly	what	Mom	was	talking	about.	I	said,	“I	won’t	tell.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Not	like	your	father	doesn’t	already	know. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hurried	to	my	room	and	cried.	Mom	didn’t	know	at	the	time	I	could	listen</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	her	thoughts,	but	she	knew	she	couldn’t	trust	me.	After	that,	whenever	she	had a	man	over,	she	told	me	to	go	outside.	When	the	weather	was	bad	she	locked	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 my	 bedroom.	 I’d	 sit	 there	 and	 watch	 the	 rain	 leaking	 in	 through	 the	 tiny window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 guess	 that’s	 why	 I	 didn’t	 freak	 out	 like	 the	 others	 when	 I	 first	 got	 to Brightside.	I	was	used	to	captivity.	The	others	weren’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 first	 few	 nights	 I	 heard	 the	 screams,	 the	 uncontrollable	 sobbing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometimes	 the	 bootsteps	 would	 follow	 and	 the	 thuds	 and	 then	 silence.	 Other times	they	just	let	the	people	cry	themselves	to	sleep.	The	apartment	walls	were too	 thick	 to	 hear	 anyone’s	 thoughts,	 but	 we	 still	 knew	 what	 each	 other	 was thinking.	You	didn’t	have	to	be	a	telepath	to	know	everyone	was	scared	shitless. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>We’d	never	leave	Brightside. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a><img src="index-27_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	THREE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	WEEK	BEFORE	BRIGHTSIDE	I	was	selling	BMW’s	and	drawing	too	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">attention.	 It’s	 amazing	 how	 easy	 it	 is	 to	 sell	 when	 you	 can	 hear	 people’s thoughts.	 If	 a	 guy	 was	 worried	 about	 draining	 his	 kid’s	 college	 tuition,	 I’d	 tell him	 driving	 a	 5-Series	 was	 an	 investment	 in	 his	 career.	 I’d	 tell	 a	 woman	 she deserved	it	when	I	knew	her	husband	was	slamming	his	secretary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	came	around.	They	didn’t	stand	a	chance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	 guy	 didn’t	 like	 my	 tie,	 looked	 like	 one	 his	 father	 wore.	 I	 said	 my parents	were	coming	for	Christmas.	Told	him	I	might	spike	my	dad’s	drink	so	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	make	it	through	dinner	without	him	reminding	me	that	my	brother	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">doctor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	have	a	brother.	The	guy	drove	off	in	a	convertible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 shattered	 every	 salesman	 record	 across	 the	 country.	 In	 the	 last	 month,	 I sold	more	cars	than	the	entire	Beverly	Hills	dealership.	My	monthly	commission</p>
<p class="calibre1">check	was	going	to	be	more	than	most	people	made	in	a	year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 dad	 called,	 asked	 if	 I’d	 heard	 about	 them	 taking	 ten	 more	 people	 to Brightside.	I	changed	the	subject,	said	I	was	thinking	about	buying	a	house	with Michelle.	He	started	lecturing	so	I	hung	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	days	before	Brightside,	Michelle	was	curled	up	on	the	couch.	She	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	her	silky	blue	pajamas,	both	feet	on	my	thigh,	her	head	way	down	on	the	other end	 where	 I	 could	 barely	 hear	 her	 thoughts.	 She	 was	 drinking	 whiskey.	 She’d taken	two	pills.	Her	brain	hardly	making	a	sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily,	 my	 eight-year-old	 Lab	 whose	 sandy	 blonde	 hair	 matched	 Michelle’s, was	 right	 below	 us	 on	 the	 soft	 white	 rug.	 All	 one	 hundred	 pounds	 wedged between	the	couch	and	coffee	table,	her	warm	breath	on	my	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	 exactly	 what	 I	 needed.	 Everyone	 at	 work	 had	 been	 talking	 about</p>
<p class="calibre1">Brightside.	 How	 they	 were	 rounding	 up	 people	 all	 over	 the	 country.	 Thought Thieves	were	real. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Michelle	 just	 lay	 there	 watching	 her	 mind-numbing	 TV	 show.	 The	 one	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t	 watch	 with	 my	 last	 girlfriend	 because	 the	 doctor	 looked	 like	 her	 last boyfriend	 and	 she’d	 be	 thinking	 about	 how	 hard	 he	 used	 to	 fuck	 her,	 what	 she didn’t	get	with	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	not	my	Michelle.	She	was	somewhere	else,	in	that	perfect	little	place, </p>
<p class="calibre1">her	thoughts	a	gentle	sea. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>I	 opened	 my	 computer,	 the	 article	 about	 the	 beautiful	 mountain	 town	 of telepaths,	 how	 it	 was	 in	 everyone’s	 interest	 that	 they	 be	 isolated.	 Thought Thieves	 could	 destroy	 everything.	 Parents	 didn’t	 want	 them	 in	 the	 schools	 or walking	the	streets.	No	one	was	safe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Halfway	through	the	article,	Michelle	started	doing	the	thing	with	her	toes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">tugging	 my	 sweats	 and	 letting	 them	 go.	 Louder	 than	 anything	 she’d	 said	 all night,	Michelle	thought	about	making	another	drink.	She	tucked	her	toes	beneath</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	and	pushed	herself	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	here,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 clicked	 on	 the	 Excel	 spreadsheet	 and	 pointed	 at	 the	 number	 in	 bold,	 left my	hand	there	to	block	the	tabs	at	the	bottom	of	the	screen.	I	waited	for	her	to wonder	why	I	had	so	many	websites	open,	what	I	was	trying	to	hide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Michelle	laid	her	head	against	my	shoulder,	ran	her	fingers	on	my	stomach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	realize	I	was	showing	her	something.	Sweet	as	ever,	she	asked,	“You</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	done?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	just	about.”	I	pointed.	“That’s	what	I’ll	bring	home	next	week.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	mouth	dropped	open,	stayed	there.	“No	way!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 wasn’t	 trying	 to	 brag,	 just	 wanted	 to	 let	 her	 to	 know	 we	 could	 buy	 the house.	“It’s	more	than	a	down	payment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Holy	 shit.”	 Michelle’s	 blue	 eyes	 dropped,	 lost	 what	 little	 shine	 they	 had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	thinking	about	the	crappy	Christmas	present	she’d	gotten	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	glass	was	empty	except	for	some	ice.	I	told	her	to	make	another	while	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">finished	 up.	 Her	 thoughts	 were	 giving	 me	 a	 headache.	 Michelle	 got	 off	 the couch,	was	extra	careful	not	to	wake	Lily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 went	 back	 to	 my	 laptop,	 started	 closing	 out	 sites.	 Homeland	 Security. </p>
<p class="calibre1">National	Safety	Council.	Half	a	dozen	others.	Each	called	us	domestic	terrorists, all	 because	 one	 man	 said	 so.	 Our	 President	 was	 scared	 shitless	 when	 he	 found out	what	we	could	do.	The	possibility	that	one	of	us	could	sneak	up	beside	him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">learn	his	every	word	was	a	lie.	The	corporations,	the	corruption,	all	the	money</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	media.	We	never	had	a	chance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	executive	order	was	issued	to	trample	our	rights.	And	the	biggest	irony</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 all,	 only	 two	 years	 before,	 Carl	 Pepper,	 a	 Thought	 Thief	 from	 Kansas,	 had single-handedly	foiled	the	President’s	assassination.	He’d	been	at	a	rally,	heard the	gunman’s	thoughts.	There	were	celebrations,	photos	of	Carl	everywhere.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	someone	realized	there	was	no	way	Carl	could’ve	known	the	stuff	that	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew.	Thought	Thieves	were	branded	enemies.	Carl	showed	up	on	the	cover	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Time</i>.	In	big	red	letters:	“Thought	Thieves	Among	Us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 didn’t	 take	 long	 for	 laws	 to	 pop	 up	 all	 over	 the	 country.	 First,	 we	 were arrested,	thrown	in	jail,	but	the	regular	prisoners	petitioned	to	have	us	removed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>That’s	when	Brightside	was	created,	an	old	mining	town	in	California,	more	than a	mile	in	the	sky,	high	enough	to	make	the	normals	feel	safe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	been	surfing	in	private,	but	I	still	cleared	the	history	before	setting	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">laptop	on	the	table.	I	didn’t	think	Michelle	would	ever	snoop,	but	there	was	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">need	to	take	the	chance.	There	was	no	shortage	of	people	who’d	sell	out	friends</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	family	for	fifty	thousand	dollars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	had	taught	me	to	trust	no	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Michelle	knew	I	was	a	stickler	when	it	came	to	my	two-drink	limit	and	put</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 bottle	 of	 Jack	 up	 in	 the	 cupboard.	 She	 came	 back	 so	 tall	 and	 graceful,	 my tipsy	swan	gliding	across	the	floor,	hardly	a	thought	in	her	beautiful	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	dimmed	the	lights	and	took	her	hand,	brought	her	beside	me	on	the	couch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Getting	 so	 close	 wasn’t	 always	 wise,	 but	 Michelle	 was	 different,	 especially	 on her	meds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	squeezed	in	behind	her,	the	thinnest	layer	of	clothes	between	us,	her	hair</p>
<p class="calibre1">sweet	vanilla,	a	home	I	never	had.	My	right	hand	rested	on	the	curve	of	her	hip, my	left	arm	under	her	neck,	holding	her	closer,	my	hand	on	her	chest,	the	thump</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	her	heart.	“This	is	perfect.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Michelle	thought	it	was	too,	but	bad	thoughts	started	flying,	ones	about	how</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	would	eventually	leave	her,	move	on	like	every	other	guy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	her	hand	and	got	it	scratching	Lily	behind	the	ear,	knew	there	was	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	to	keep	thinking	bad	things	with	that	tongue	licking	the	air,	those	two	brown eyes	so	full	of	love. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Michelle	 recovered,	 kissed	 Lily’s	 nose	 as	 a	 thank	 you.	 I	 massaged</p>
<p class="calibre1">Michelle’s	shoulders	and	she	sank	back	against	me,	let	her	mind	go	all	dreamy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	she	thought	something	that	tore	open	my	heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	loved	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	for	the	first	time,	I	wondered	if	I	could	tell	her	the	truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	day	I	heard	my	boss,	Saul,	thinking	I	was	making	too	many	sales. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	BMW,	I’d	never	stay	at	a	job	too	long.	Couple	of	months,	tops.	Just	make</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 cash	 and	 quit.	 But	 I	 was	 so	 close	 to	 buying	 the	 house,	 I’d	 stayed	 there almost	a	year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	ease	Saul’s	suspicious	mind,	I	tanked	the	next	three	customers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Boy	Wonder	having	an	off-day?”	Saul	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	only	human,	Saul.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 knew	 my	 time	 there	 was	 up.	 I	 asked	 Saul	 if	 I	 could	 get	 my	 commission early,	 said	 I	 wanted	 to	 get	 something	 nice	 for	 Michelle.	 Saul	 said	 he’d	 think about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	got	home,	Michelle	thought	I	was	acting	strange.	I’d	been	thinking</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>about	telling	her	the	truth	about	me,	but	I	didn’t	want	to	screw	things	up	before	I got	my	commission.	Once	the	check	cleared,	we	could	take	off,	move	anywhere, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 I’d	 tell	 her	 everything.	 In	 public,	 Michelle	 spoke	 just	 like	 everyone	 else, saying	Thought	Thieves	should	be	locked	away,	but	I	figured	she’d	change	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind	if	she	knew	I	was	one	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still,	I	was	too	stressed.	I	just	needed	to	clear	my	head	and	hers.	I	poured</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	a	drink	and	took	her	to	the	bedroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later,	 we	 were	 back	 in	 the	 living	 room,	 the	 lights	 off,	 a	 soft	 glow	 from Letterman	because	I	was	too	comfortable	to	grab	the	remote	off	the	coffee	table</p>
<p class="calibre1">next	to	our	half-eaten	dinner.	Michelle	and	I	curled	up,	our	clothes	back	on.	I	felt calm,	 relaxed.	 And	 it	 wasn’t	 just	 because	 Michelle	 took	 me	 to	 the	 place	 where all	I	can	hear	is	myself	saying	Jesus,	Jesus,	Jesus,	holy	shit	that	feels	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	closeness.	The	closeness	to	someone	still	awake,	even	if	barely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Being	 able	 to	 lie	 with	 someone	 who	 wasn’t	 constantly	 judging	 or	 whining	 or worrying.	I	wanted	to	live	like	this	forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily	 was	 down	 below	 us,	 back	 from	 her	 banishment	 to	 the	 kitchen	 while Michelle	 and	 I	 had	 been	 busy.	 I	 was	 proud	 of	 her	 for	 not	 eating	 the	 leftover steak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	Lily’s	ears	perked.	She	raised	her	head	above	the	coffee	table,	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	got	up	on	my	elbow	and	reached	for	the	remote. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily	 got	 to	 her	 feet	 and	 I	 muted	 the	 TV,	 thought	 I	 heard	 a	 whisper	 by	 the window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Michelle	 mumbled	 and	 I	 shushed	 her,	 said	 everything	 was	 okay.	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">concentrated	hard,	focused	on	the	sides	of	my	head,	an	inch	above	my	ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 man	 outside	 the	 window.  <i class="calibre4">This	 is	 gonna	 be	 a	 blast.	 Fuck	 yeah.	 Rock	 n’</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">roll. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Three. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Two. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">One. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 bam.	 The	 window	 shattered	 and	 the	 door	 boomed,	 flecks	 of	 wood</p>
<p class="calibre1">flying	 through	 the	 air.	 Michelle’s	 head	 jerked	 back,	 smacked	 my	 mouth.	 Lily barking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 went	 for	 the	 steak	 knife,	 but	 Lily	 tipped	 over	 the	 table.	 The	 front	 door cracked	open,	a	wall	of	yellow	lights.	I	covered	Michelle	and	looked	at	what	just clanked	off	the	floor,	a	metal	canister	rolling	toward	the	couch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	blast	of	light	snuffed	out	my	sight,	an	unbelievable	pop	and	I	couldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear.	Everything	was	black,	my	shouts	just	whispers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Michelle	 was	 flailing,	 not	 knowing	 anything,	 falling	 off	 the	 couch.	 Then</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>came	another	pop	and	more	whispers.	A	loud	angry	voice	rushed	toward	me.	He thought,  <i class="calibre4">Take	that. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 blow	 to	 my	 back	 felt	 like	 a	 baseball	 bat	 at	 full	 speed,	 the	 pain immediate.	 I	 screamed	 but	 couldn’t	 hear	 it,	 just	 the	 shrill	 ringing,	 piercing	 my brain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	lost	Michelle’s	thoughts,	but	felt	her	below	me.	Then	fingers	sunk	into	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">arm,	lifted	me	up,	let	me	go.	I	bounced	off	the	floor	and	weight	came	down	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	neck,	paralyzed	my	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ringing	continued.	One	hand	then	the	other	wrenched	behind	my	back, </p>
<p class="calibre1">metal	pinching	skin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	vision	came	in,	white	and	fuzzy,	couldn’t	make	out	shit	except	someone</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 turned	 on	 the	 lights.	 It	 took	 me	 a	 second	 to	 see	 the	 puffy	 clouds	 were	 the carpet	up	close.	Then	Lily	came	into	focus	less	than	a	foot	away.	Her	eyes	open, looking	at	me,	the	rug	turning	red	around	her.	“My	dog!”	I	shouted,	“What	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fuck	did	you	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	knee	dug	down	on	my	neck	and	I	pushed	back	because	it	felt	like	I	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">dying.	 The	 guy	 on	 top	 of	 me	 just	 put	 more	 pressure,	 made	 his	 forearm	 a	 lever between	my	arms	and	back,	hoped	I’d	try	something	so	he	could	fucking	break</p>
<p class="calibre1">me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	closed	my	eyes	and	grit	my	teeth,	said	okay,	okay,	and	gave	up	the	fight.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">got	hard	to	breathe,	even	harder	to	think,	my	skull	ready	to	crack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 knee	 let	 off	 enough	 for	 me	 to	 open	 my	 eyes,	 the	 ringing	 beginning	 to fade.	I	watched	Lily	whine	like	never	before,	her	back	legs	kicking	slower	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">slower.	From	behind	me,	Michelle	screamed,	“Let	me	go!	Lily!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 ringing	 was	 gone,	 but	 I	 could	 only	 hear	 out	 my	 left	 ear.	 No	 more Michelle,	just	Lily	and	the	sound	of	heavy	footsteps	shaking	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	yelled,	“Gomez,	get	him	over	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 the	 pressure	 left	 my	 neck	 as	 Gomez	 told	 Hendricks,	 “Yes,	 Sir.”	 I	 got yanked	 up	 by	 my	 forearms,	 dragged	 three	 steps,	 screaming	 because	 that’s	 all	 I could	 do.	 Gomez	 used	 his	 knee	 to	 knock	 my	 head	 the	 other	 way	 then	 dropped me	down	on	the	carpet,	right	next	to	the	knife	that	would’ve	got	us	killed	if	I’d been	a	little	faster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gomez’s	knee	came	down	on	my	neck,	made	it	so	I	couldn’t	look	away	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter	how	much	I	wanted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hendricks	had	Michelle	bent	over	the	edge	of	the	couch,	her	head	smashed</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 cushion,	 eye	 shut	 and	 mouth	 open,	 somehow	 holding	 back	 a	 scream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hendricks	 stood	 behind	 Michelle,	 wedged	 in	 tight	 between	 her	 trembling	 legs, his	hand	on	her	cranked	back	wrist.	He	wore	all	black,	no	letters	anywhere,	hid</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind	the	helmet	and	face	shield,	ski	mask	beneath. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>His	eyes	were	the	warning.	Two	black	hollow	points	aiming	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thanks	to	the	mask,	I	couldn’t	see	Hendrick’s	lips	moving,	but	he	asked	if	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	hear	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	then,	all	jacked	up,	I	had	the	wits	not	to	say	shit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	no	question	Hendricks	was	talking	out	loud	when	he	said,	“Tear</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	 place	 apart.	 He’s	 got	 something	 somewhere.	 Everyone	 does.	 Grab	 his computer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Michelle	screamed,	“Why	are	you	doing	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	told	me	to	go	ahead	and	tell	her.	Tell	her	what	I	could	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	vision	was	too	clear,	the	biggest	crack	tearing	through	Michelle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe,	what’d	you	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hendricks	shut	her	up	with	a	twist	of	her	wrist.	I	didn’t	see	the	mask	move</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	he	thought,  <i class="calibre4">Nine	plus	two</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Say	it,	and	it’ll	all	stop. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	kept	quiet,	felt	the	puff	of	breath	on	my	arm,	Lily’s	nose	on	my	elbow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gomez	must’ve	seen	it	because	he	thought	it	was	some	sad	shit,	didn’t	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">why	Hendricks	lit	her	up	in	the	first	place.	“Someone	do	something	about	this,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boots	stomped	across	the	floor,	each	one	rattling	my	chest.	All	casual,	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	guy	was	ordering	a	coffee,	he	said,	“Friendly	fire.”	Then	two	blasts,	each	a jolt	through	my	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	whining	was	over,	Michelle’s	face	buried	in	the	cushion,	sobbing	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily	was	her	child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hendricks	let	go	of	Michelle’s	wrist,	put	his	hand	on	her	waist. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Nine	plus	two,	fuckhead. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said	nothing	and	he	said,	“Fine.	Get	this	piece	of	shit	out	of	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ski	mask	covered	his	smile,	but	I	knew	it	was	there.	He	thought	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	 kind	 of	 questioning	 he’d	 put	 Michelle	 through.	 How	 she’d	 do	 and	 say whatever	he	asked	once	she	found	out	the	prison	term	for	harboring	a	terrorist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gomez	jerked	me	to	my	feet	and	Hendricks	asked,	“What’s	it	going	to	be?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	I	had	to	do	was	say	it.  <i class="calibre4">Nine	plus	two. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Michelle	didn’t	deserve	any	of	this.	I	told	her	I	was	sorry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	I	said	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eleven.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a><img src="index-33_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	FOUR</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 MET	 WITH	 SHARON	 ON	 Day	 41,	 holding	 off	 as	 long	 as	 possible	 after	 the Rachel	 incident.	 I	 didn’t	 want	 to	 hear	 her	 bullshit	 or	 talk	 about	 my	 feelings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	invited	me	in,	asked	me	to	sit.	I	stared	at	the	steady	stream	from	her	Zen waterfall.	 We	 didn’t	 speak	 for	 at	 least	 a	 minute,	 Sharon	 smiling,	 her	 back	 nice and	tall,	perfect	posture.	I	felt	myself	slouching,	almost	to	the	point	I	thought	I’d slide	right	off	the	couch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	would	you	like	to	talk	about	today?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 hated	 how	 easily	 Sharon	 sifted	 through	 my	 thoughts.	 I	 tried	 not	 to	 think about	Rachel,	Lily,	this	whole	fucked	up	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">You	don’t	have	to	say	anything, </i> Sharon	thought.  <i class="calibre4">We	can	just	do	this	silently</i> <i class="calibre4">if	it	makes	it	easier. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	backed	into	the	couch.	“Don’t	you	have	to	want	to	share	for	therapy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Therapy	can	work	in	many	ways.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	stay	out	of	my	head.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	 smoothed	 out	 her	 white	 slacks,	 her	 short	 blonde	 hair	 plastered</p>
<p class="calibre1">down.	 Sharon	 had	 the	 longest	 range	 of	 anyone	 in	 Brightside.	 She	 could	 hear your	thoughts	from	fifty	feet	on	a	clear	day.	I	never	understood	how	she	stayed</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	calm.	She	heard	thoughts	wherever	she	went.	I	guess	the	meditation	helped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	said	it	did.	I	heard	that	soft	humming	mantra	flowing	from	her	skull. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silent	 therapy	 made	 sense.	 Just	 cut	 through	 the	 crap	 and	 spill	 out	 every thought.	 Even	 with	 the	 waterfall’s	 soothing	 sounds	 and	 these	 yellow	 walls	 to make	us	feel	comfortable,	people	never	say	what’s	really	on	their	mind.	It’s	how society	 works.	 We	 glance	 off	 the	 truth,	 avoid	 conflict.	 We’re	 trained	 to	 keep	 it pleasant,	 hold	 back.	 Silent	 therapy	 allowed	 Sharon	 to	 get	 past	 all	 that,	 but	 I didn’t	want	her	digging,	not	that	I	could	do	anything	to	block	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s	Rachel?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Safe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Right. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	smiled,	even	as	I	imagined	strangling	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 perfectly	 natural	 to	 be	 angry,	 Joe.	 Brightside	 takes	 getting	 used	 to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’re	all	on	different	timelines.	But	if	you’re	willing	to	open	up,	you’ll	see	how</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>wonderful	it	can	be.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pictured	Rachel,	catatonic,	staring	at	nothing	in	the	Cabin,	the	place	rule-</p>
<p class="calibre1">breakers	were	sent	to	drool. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Carlos	says	you’re	doing	well.	Your	sales	are	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carlos	was	my	boss.	He	wore	American	flag	pins	on	his	tie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	long	do	I	have	to	be	here?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	 long.”	 Sharon	 studied	 me,	 staring,	 probing	 my	 head.	 “You	 know,	 I have	a	good	feeling	about	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	going	to	be	disappointed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.	We’ll	see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	 only	 been	 forced	 to	 see	 Sharon	 twice.	 The	 first	 time	 was	 the	 hardest: Day	1	in	Brightside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	wasn’t	a	trial	after	the	raid.	They	held	a	group	of	us	in	a	cell	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">night.	 They	 woke	 us	 by	 yelling.	 My	 right	 ear	 was	 still	 out	 from	 the	 flashbang, my	 left	 muffled	 with	 a	 light	 ringing.	 They	 brought	 us	 to	 the	 helicopter	 outside and	took	us	up	into	the	sky.	Some	thought	it	was	beautiful,	the	rising	sun	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 cute	 mountain	 town.	 I	 never	 saw	 it,	 kept	 my	 eyes	 shut,	 too	 afraid	 to	 look down,	 see	 the	 drop.	 Someone	 was	 telling	 us	 about	 Brightside,	 gave	 us	 a	 quick history.	 I	 only	 heard	 every	 fifth	 word,	 focused	 on	 my	 clenched	 fists	 cuffed behind	my	back,	my	pounding	heart.	Seemed	like	we’d	been	rising	for	hours,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	was	probably	only	minutes.	My	eyelids	didn’t	open	until	the	helicopter	landed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 took	 a	 deep	 breath.	 The	 air	 burned	 my	 lungs,	 so	 cold,	 thin.	 I	 thought	 I	 might pass	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 finally	 unlocked	 the	 cuffs,	 told	 us	 we	 were	 going	 to	 be	 processed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brightside	 loved	 paperwork.	 We	 had	 to	 sign	 forms	 stating	 we	 were	 here voluntarily.	They	told	us	we	had	no	choice,	that	if	we	didn’t	sign,	our	stay	would be	 unpleasant.	 If	 we	 just	 scratched	 our	 names	 down,	 things	 would	 get	 a	 lot easier.	 I	 don’t	 remember	 signing,	 but	 I	 must	 have,	 because	 they	 took	 me	 to human	resources,	helped	me	land	a	job.	They	liked	I	had	a	background	in	sales. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People	 were	 smiling,	 nodding.	 They	 said	 this	 was	 going	 to	 be	 fun.	 They	 loved that	word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	ice	cream	parlor	is	fun.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Karaoke	nights	are	super	fun.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Summer	is	the	most	fun.	We	have	intramural	kickball	games.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next,	 I	 was	 sent	 to	 Sharon.	 All	 of	 us	 new	 residents	 were	 sitting	 in	 her pleasant	 waiting	 room.	 “Know	 Thyself,	 Love	 Thyself”	 painted	 in	 pink	 flowery sweeps	across	the	yellow	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	recognized	one	of	the	guys,	Phuc	Li,	the	world	famous	poker	player.	He’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">won	every	major	tournament,	collected	eleven	bracelets,	racked	up	millions.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>even	 had	 his	 own	 late	 night	 poker	 show	 on	 TV.	 Some	 called	 him	 “Lucky	 Li.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Others	used	his	first	name.	Turned	out	he	wasn’t	lucky	at	all.	I	realized	I’d	been in	the	wrong	business.	He’d	made	more	money	playing	poker	in	a	single	night</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	I	made	in	the	year	at	BMW. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Phuc	stared	at	me	from	behind	his	sunglasses	and	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	 else	 stared	 at	 their	 laps	 or	 the	 floor.	 I	 heard	 one	 guy	 thinking about	his	wife,	the	bitch	who’d	turned	him	in.	Another	woman	thought	about	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">kids	stuck	with	their	alcoholic	father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brightsiders	 weren’t	 allowed	 to	 keep	 their	 kids.	 There	 were	 petitions,	 but they	 wouldn’t	 change	 anything,	 normals	 couldn’t	 stay	 on	 the	 mountain.	 After some	time,	we	could	have	visitors,	not	that	I	expected	anyone	to	ever	show. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	mumbled,	“Cut	that	shit	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guy	beside	me	thought,  <i class="calibre4">Yeah,	who	brought	the	retard? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 wondered	 what	 I	 was	 doing	 and	 checked	 my	 feet	 to	 make	 sure	 I	 wasn’t tapping. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Not	 you. </i> My	 neighbor	 nudged	 his	 hand	 to	 the	 right,	 his	 last	 three	 fingers purple	and	swollen.  <i class="calibre4">Einstein	over	there. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 guy	 reading	 the	 comic	 book	 in	 the	 corner	 looked	 old	 enough	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">college,	 but	 his	 extra	 tight	 Donald	 Duck	 t-shirt	 and	 white	 name	 tag	 with	 big blocky	letters	said	it	was	more	likely	he’d	been	hijacked	from	preschool.	The	tag was	 scrunched	 up	 and	 falling	 off,	 but	 his	 bright	 blue	 hat	 with	 red	 embroidered letters	spelled	out	DANNY	for	everyone	to	see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	my	head	so	I	could	hear	what	was	pissing	people	off.	The	rustle	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">paper	 and	 squeak	 of	 the	 comic	 book’s	 battered	 cover	 as	 Danny	 rubbed	 it	 back and	forth	in	his	right	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	 though	 I	 hadn’t	 met	 many	 Thought	 Thieves	 before	 Brightside,	 I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">assumed	 they	 were	 all	 masterminds,	 or	 at	 least	 intelligent,	 definitely	 brighter than	me.	There	were	two	guys	between	us,	but	I	did	my	best	to	block	them	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 focused	 on	 Danny.	 I	 listened	 to	 him	 silently	 sound	 out	 each	 word	 in	 his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	wasn’t	right	to	listen	in,	but	I	needed	an	escape	from	reality	and	I’d	never</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard	GI	Joe	in	slow	motion.	There	were	more	“BOOMs!”	and	“BLAMs!”	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	expecting,	but	never	any	death.	All	that	noise,	all	those	bullets.	I	guessed there	was	no	friendly	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	clack	of	heels	stopped	the	story.	Sharon	stood	in	the	doorway,	cool	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">collected	in	her	white	pantsuit,	hands	folded	in	front	of	her.	She	was	over	fifty, but	 could	 have	 passed	 for	 thirty-five.	 All	 that	 age-defying	 meditation.	 Sharon retreated	into	her	office,	her	short	blonde	hair	sprayed	into	place.	She	called	me by	my	first	name	like	I	was	a	friend	and	told	me	to	step	inside.	She	got	behind</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>her	mahogany	desk	and	waved	me	over	like	I	was	a	puppy.	“Come	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	me	sit.	Waited	for	me	to	speak	first.	When	I	wouldn’t,	she	told	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	Brightside,	how	it	wasn’t	so	bad,	that	I	just	had	to	settle	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 later	 learned	 that	 things	 hadn’t	 always	 been	 so	 cheery.	 The	 place	 had changed.	In	the	beginning,	people	like	us	were	kept	in	the	Cabin	or	behind	steel bars	in	the	basements.	Too	many	took	their	own	lives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	the	politicians	and	lawyers	arrived.	Phillip,	the	ex-Senator.	Grace,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">New	 York	 D.A.	 with	 her	 perfect	 conviction	 rate.	 Phillip	 and	 Grace	 formed	 the Brightside	 Council.	 They	 turned	 things	 around,	 got	 us	 more	 funding,	 lessened the	 security,	 even	 put	 a	 stop	 to	 the	 sterilization.	 Brightsiders	 could	 have	 babies and	families.	We	could	live	normal	lives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Things	could	be	worse,”	Sharon	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	see	how,	even	after	I	was	shown	my	new	apartment	and	taken	on	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">tour	of	the	town.	We	were	given	free	meals	for	the	first	two	days.	After	that,	we had	 to	 pay	 for	 everything	 with	 the	 money	 we	 earned.	 Outside	 contact	 was forbidden	 the	 first	 week.	 No	 calls,	 no	 letters	 back	 home.	 Once	 Sharon	 and	 the Council	 deemed	 us	 safe,	 we	 could	 make	 contact.	 Monitored	 contact.	 We	 could also	receive	gifts.	Not	that	I	expected	anything.	After	they	dragged	me	from	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">place,	 Michelle	 thought	 I	 was	 a	 piece	 of	 shit.	 And	 my	 parents...right.	 They’d forgotten	half	of	my	birthdays	as	a	kid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	only	gift	I	received	was	from	the	Council.	A	hundred	dollar	gift	card	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 use	 anywhere	 in	 Brightside.	 Day	 7	 I	 bought	 an	 iPod	 to	 block	 out	 all	 the thoughts.	Danny	bought	comic	books	and	a	postcard	to	send	to	his	sister,	Sara.	A bright	blue	pencil	so	he	could	sign	his	name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	 stood	 by	 the	 rack,	 the	 sharpened	 pencil	 clenched	 in	 his	 fist,	 his thumb	 sliding	 down	 then	 up	 to	 the	 eraser.	 He	 kept	 doing	 it	 as	 he	 stared	 at	 the comic	books,	his	thumb	going	back	and	forth,	his	hat	down	low	to	hide	most	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	 was	 there	 when	 they	 took	 him.	 Danny	 had	 been	 listening	 to	 a	 store clerk’s	thoughts.	Two	black	guys	were	standing	by	the	rack	of	CDs.	Danny	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’d	watch	them	to	make	sure	they	weren’t	stealing.	Sara	told	him	to	be	quiet, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 the	 black	 guys	 had	 heard	 him,	 started	 shoving	 Danny.	 The	 clerk	 thought about	going	for	his	pistol.	Danny	told	him	no	guns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly,	 the	 guys	 and	 the	 clerk	 were	 on	 the	 same	 side.	 Sara	 begged	 for them	 to	 just	 let	 her	 and	 Danny	 go,	 but	 the	 Boots	 arrived.	 Danny	 was	 cuffed, taken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	felt	bad	for	listening	and	moved	to	the	sketchpads.	I	used	to	sketch	when	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 a	 kid.	 Hadn’t	 done	 it	 in	 years,	 but	 something	 about	 the	 pad	 and	 colored pencils	made	me	want	to	pick	it	up.	From	the	end	of	the	aisle,	Danny	asked	if	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>was	a	drawer.	He	sounded	like	a	six-year-old	cowboy	with	a	speech	impediment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thanks	 to	 the	 cowards	 too	 scared	 to	 knock,	 my	 right	 ear	 was	 still	 next	 to useless.	I	turned	my	head	and	Danny	repeated	the	question.	He	used	his	finger	to draw	on	the	air	because	I	was	the	one	being	slow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 pulled	 down	 my	 sleeves	 to	 cover	 the	 purple	 bruises	 ringing	 both	 wrists and	said,	“I	used	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	tugged	on	his	hat	and	walked	over	real	slow,	his	custom-order	Dino-</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoes	flashing	red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 Danny	 got	 to	 where	 the	 average	 person	 would	 stop,	 I	 said,	 “Cool shoes,	man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	surprised	me	and	took	another	step,	came	in	close	enough	for	me	to	tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">two	 of	 his	 favorite	 foods	 were	 peanut	 butter	 and	 pickles.	 Danny	 didn’t	 say	 a word	about	my	wrists,	just	pointed	at	his	feet.	“T-Rex	is	my	favorite.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	“Mine,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	backed	up	a	bit	to	give	me	some	room,	but	stayed	well	within	my	six-</p>
<p class="calibre1">foot	range.	Like	he	wasn’t	so	sure	he	was	saying	it	right,	he	said,	“I’m	Danny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	right	hand	was	busy	with	the	pencil	so	he	stuck	out	his	left	with	a	rolled-up comic	book	in	it.	He	raised	his	head	and	showed	me	his	hazel	eyes	that	were	too</p>
<p class="calibre1">close	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having	someone	look	me	in	the	eyes	has	never	been	easy,	but	Dad	taught</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	to	watch	them	when	someone’s	talking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	said	if	you	want	to	know	what	people	look	like	when	they	lie,	just	look</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	in	the	eyes	and	ask	how	they’re	doing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	said	the	eyes	show	everything.	They	show	the	real	you.	And	that	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	I	didn’t	want	anyone	seeing.	Especially	some	stranger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Danny	didn’t	have	the	eyes	of	a	stranger.	They	were	the	kindest	shade</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 hazel,	 the	 softest	 brown	 I’d	 ever	 seen.	 There	 was	 a	 whole	 lot	 of	 hurt	 filling those	eyes,	but	the	flecks	of	gold	said	he’d	be	alright. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 gave	 the	 comic	 book	 a	 shake	 like	 that’s	 how	 everyone	 did	 it.	 “Nice	 to meet	you,	Danny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	turned	his	neck	like	he	was	trying	to	get	out	the	kink	then	pointed	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	sketchpad	and	asked,	“You	a	pro?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	just	for	fun.”	That	word	“fun”	making	me	want	to	puke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	 picked	 up	 the	 sketchpad	 and	 the	 box	 of	 colored	 pencils.	 He	 said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	need	these.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 still	 had	 money	 left	 on	 the	 gift	 card,	 but	 thought	 I	 should	 save	 it.	 I followed	Danny	to	the	register	and	told	him,	“I’m	not	sure	I	want	to	buy	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	unzipped	his	blue	fanny	pack	and	paid	with	his	own	card.	Then	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">handed	over	the	pad	and	pencils	and	said,	“Happy	new	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a><img src="index-38_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="index-38_2.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Danny...	I	can’t	accept	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	to.	I	want	to	see	you	draw.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	haven’t	done	it	since	I	was	a	kid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Need	practice.	Come	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	 ran	 out	 the	 door,	 over	 to	 a	 bench,	 plopped	 down.	 Reluctantly,	 I	 sat and	opened	the	pad	to	the	very	first	page.	“What	would	you	like	me	to	draw?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	 said	 he	 didn’t	 know,	 but	 I	 knew	 he	 was	 being	 shy.	 I	 turned	 and listened	for	his	thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	got	nothing,	the	first	time	that’d	ever	happened	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	 been	 around	 people	 who	 didn’t	 think	 much	 or	 were	 always	 distracted, caught	up	in	the	moment.	But	this	was	different.	With	Danny	there	was	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	one	thought,	just	that	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny’s	kind	eyes	got	worried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	out	the	charcoal	pencil,	finally	heard	Danny’s	thoughts.	“You	didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">ruin	it.”	I	gave	him	a	smile	and	said,	“It’s	cool.	It’ll	be	a	surprise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 turned	 off	 my	 mind	 and	 looked	 across	 the	 park.	 Rachel	 was	 sitting	 by	 a tree.	I’d	met	her	at	work,	but	we’d	barely	spoken,	both	of	us	too	scared,	knowing we	were	being	watched.	My	pencil	got	moving.	In	less	than	a	minute,	I	had	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">outline. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IT	 WAS	 A	 HALF-DAY,	 Mom	 another	 no-show.	 But	 this	 time	 I	 was	 six,	 old enough	to	use	the	under-the-mat	key.	I	hoped	I’d	have	the	house	to	myself,	even</p>
<p class="calibre1">though	 that	 meant	 Mom	 would	 be	 at	 someone	 else’s.	 But	 she	 was	 home, </p>
<p class="calibre1">laughing	so	loud	she	didn’t	hear	me	open	the	back	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 walked	 past	 the	 dryer’s	 low	 rumble,	 my	 Ghostbusters	 backpack	 in	 one hand,	my	drawing	in	the	other.	I	heard	a	man’s	voice,	the	aerobics	instructor,	the one	with	the	big	dick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 kid’s	 a	 regular	 Picasso.	 Look	 at	 all	 the	 crap	 I’ve	 got	 on	 my	 fridge.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	crumpled	up	the	drawing	and	ran	to	my	room.	She	came	in	later,	heard	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">crying.	She	wished	I	wasn’t	such	a	whiny	brat.	She	tried	to	console	me,	make	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">feel	better,	but	her	thoughts	told	the	truth	and	made	everything	so	much	worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">DANNY	 COULDN’T	 STAY	 still,	 kept	 shifting,	 tapping	 his	 legs	 like	 a	 drum, thumbing	the	paint	off	his	pencil.	I	made	him	my	helper	and	asked	for	colors,	but he	didn’t	know	them	all	by	name.	I	pointed.	He	figured	it	out.	By	the	time	I	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>done	with	the	drawing	I	was	ready	to	crumple	it	up	like	I	did	with	Mom.	Anyone who	saw	it	would	know	I	was	no	artist,	I’d	never	been	good	with	faces,	but	I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">sort	of	captured	Rachel’s	insecurity,	the	way	she	adjusted,	sucked	in	so	her	belly wouldn’t	spill	over	her	skirt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	asked	if	I	was	done.	I	tore	it	out	and	handed	it	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	said	it	was	perfect	and	I	said	it	was	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	held	up	the	picture,	his	eyes	all	shiny.	“It’s	everything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	jumped	to	his	feet	and	ran	over	to	Rachel.	Handed	it	to	her.	He	pointed</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	to	me	and	she	smiled.	I	felt	guilty	and	left,	wandered	out	into	the	forest	and carved	 Michelle’s	 name	 in	 that	 tall	 pine	 tree.	 They	 hadn’t	 told	 us	 we	 could venture	into	the	woods,	but	I	didn’t	care,	just	kept	walking	until	I	found	that	tree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pulled	out	my	apartment	keys	and	dug	into	the	bark.	For	a	second,	I	thought	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">key	 might	 break,	 but	 I	 just	 kept	 carving,	 digging,	 needing	 to	 see	 her	 name, pretend	I	could	make	things	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	only	I’d	told	her	the	truth,	hadn’t	been	so	greedy	about	the	house,	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">smarter	like	Dad	had	told	me	to	be.	Maybe	then	I	wouldn’t	have	ended	up	here, </p>
<p class="calibre1">trapped	on	this	fucking	mountain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fucking	Saul. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	he	was	suspicious	at	BMW,	knew	he	was	thinking	about	turning	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">in,	but	I	pressed,	thought	I	had	a	few	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Michelle’s	name	was	finally	carved,	I	fell	against	the	tree	and	wept.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">can’t	remember	ever	crying	like	that	as	an	adult.	My	mind	falling	into	the	past.	I thought	 about	 getting	 lost	 in	 the	 snow	 as	 a	 kid,	 that	 nice	 woman	 hugging	 me, taking	me	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	home	I’d	never	see	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 sun	 began	 to	 set,	 and	 the	 temperature	 dropped,	 the	 tears	 warm	 trails down	 my	 cheeks.	 I	 finally	 got	 up,	 walked	 back	 towards	 the	 apartment.	 That’s when	 I	 heard	 the	 car.	 It	 rounded	 the	 curve	 way	 up	 the	 mountain.	 It	 was	 dark blue,	definitely	a	Chrysler.	The	same	kind	Michelle	drove. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	started	running.	She’d	come	to	save	me! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	car	was	half	a	block	away.	I	still	couldn’t	see	the	driver,	but	I	knew	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	Michelle.	I	wasn’t	a	piece	of	shit.	She’d	forgiven	me,	probably	knew	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	ability	all	along. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	ran	into	the	middle	of	the	street,	waving	my	arms	like	an	idiot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Michelle!	Michelle!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	car	was	going	fast	and	headed	right	for	me.	I	closed	my	eyes,	thought	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t	stop,	the	screech	of	brakes	louder	than	anything	I’ve	ever	heard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	opened	my	eyes,	the	car	only	a	foot	from	me,	its	front	door	thrown	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 the	 quickest	 I’ve	 gone	 from	 one	 feeling	 to	 another.	 First	 thinking	 I	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>free,	saved,	still	loved,	then	straight	to	scared	shitless,	because	the	driver	was	out of	 the	 car,	 running	 right	 at	 me,	 screaming	 for	 me	 to	 get	 down,	 his	 big	 fucking pistol	pointed	right	at	my	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 happened	 so	 quick	 I	 just	 saw	 flashes.	 Blue	 jeans,	 black	 windbreaker, angry	 brown	 eyes.	 And	 then	 he	 was	 on	 me,	 kicking	 my	 legs	 out,	 pushing	 my head,	slamming	me	to	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	black	boot	went	on	my	cheek	like	he	was	squashing	a	bug.	He	shouted, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stay	the	fuck	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 yelled	 like	 a	 little	 girl.	 “Get	 off	 of	 me!”	 Then	 I	 grabbed	 his	 boot	 and pushed	it	off	to	prove	I	wasn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 boot	 went	 away,	 but	 metal	 came	 back.	 Hard.	 The	 barrel	 of	 the	 gun pushed	at	my	temple,	dug	into	the	bone	like	it	didn’t	need	a	bullet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could	barely	open	my	jaw.	It	sounded	all	screwed	up	when	I	said,	“What’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	want	to	die?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 didn’t	 try	 to	 talk.	 Laid	 still.	 Focused	 on	 the	 cold	 gravel	 digging	 into	 my cheek,	not	on	the	gun	twitching,	pressing	like	all	this	guy	wanted	to	do	was	pull the	trigger	and	splatter	my	brain	across	the	street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 put	 more	 pressure	 on	 the	 gun,	 his	 breath	 straight	 caffeine.	 “You	 think it’d	matter	if	I	killed	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	 footsteps	 approached,	 cowboy	 boots.	 And	 then	 Melvin,	 Brightside’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">sheriff,	asked,	“Everything	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wanted	to	say	no,	it	wasn’t	right	at	all,	but	the	gun	was	still	there,	pinning me	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black	boots	said,	“Yeah,	it’s	fine.	Go	back	inside	where	it’s	warm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Melvin	said,	“I’m	okay.	Reminds	me	of	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 was	 just	 finishing	 up	 with	 this	 guy.”	 The	 prick	 tapped	 the	 side	 of	 my head,	letting	me	know	where	he	wanted	to	put	the	bullet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	he	learned	his	lesson,”	Sheriff	Melvin	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black	boots	pulled	the	gun	off	me	and	kicked	my	leg	when	he	walked	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	his	car.	“You	get	up	before	I’m	gone	and	you’ll	be	sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 Boots	 called	 themselves	 agents,	 but	 I	 never	 would.	 Even	 the	 term</p>
<p class="calibre1">“cop”	was	too	good	for	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Face	 down	 on	 the	 ground,	 though,	 I’d	 never	 been	 so	 still,	 my	 eyes	 on	 the American	flag	rippling	back	and	forth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Melvin	 chuckled.	 When	 I	 didn’t	 look	 at	 him,	 he	 said,	 “Know	 what	 I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking	right	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 turned	 just	 my	 face	 because	 I	 figured	 he	 wouldn’t	 leave	 until	 I	 did.	 He stood	there,	a	huge	smile	hanging	underneath	the	darkest	pair	of	sunglasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>“I	 was	 thinking	 about	 what	 that	 guy	 asked	 you.	 I	 was	 thinking	 no	 one would	care.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	got	to	my	feet	and	stepped	to	the	side.	The	Chrysler	zipped	by	and	for	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">split	second	I	was	staring	into	the	eyes	of	the	man	who	could	have	ended	me.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wished	he	had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Melvin	asked,	“You	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	waited	until	the	car	made	its	way	around	the	Circle	and	disappeared	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">Main	Street.	“Yeah,	I’m	alright.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Melvin	put	his	hand	on	my	shoulder	and	guided	me	to	the	curb.	He	had	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">bushy	white	mustache,	which	made	him	look	like	the	guy	from	the	Quaker	Oats</p>
<p class="calibre1">commercials	on	a	bender. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have	a	seat	a	second.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	felt	like	I’d	just	been	kicked	in	the	balls,	the	body,	the	face,	but	I	deserved it.	I	was	the	idiot	who	ran	in	front	of	a	car.	The	idiot	that	thought	Michelle	would ever	want	to	see	me	again.	Even	if	she	lived	in	the	next	city	over,	she	wouldn’t come.	Not	unless	it	was	to	demand	an	apology	or	watch	me	suffer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Melvin	used	the	side	of	his	cowboy	boot	to	sweep	the	bloody	gravel	at	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">feet.	“You	sure	you’re	okay?”	He	pointed	at	the	Cabin.	“We	can	go	in	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	know	much	about	the	Cabin	at	the	time,	but	I	knew	enough	to	stay</p>
<p class="calibre1">away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wiped	off	my	hands,	pretended	like	I	didn’t	want	to	cry.	I	didn’t	have	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">ask	Melvin	to	leave	me	alone	or	tell	him	I	couldn’t	talk.	All	I	did	was	look	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	read	the	banner	rippling	above	the	Square,	the	big	red	letters	on	both	sides:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome	to	Brightside.	Welcome	Home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a><img src="index-42_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	FIVE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">BRIGHTSIDE	WAS	PLASTIC.	It	was	all	just	pretend.	Everything.	The	jobs,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">town,	 the	 Council,	 our	 freedom	 to	 shop.	 Each	 detail	 fabricated	 so	 we	 wouldn’t jump	off	the	edge	of	this	damn	mountain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	the	plastic	rubbed	off.	It	let	me	pretend	Rachel	and	I	were	in	love,	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Michelle	had	come	to	rescue	me,	that	I	had	options.	It	almost	got	me	killed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Day	8,	I	showed	up	to	my	job	and	pretended	to	work.	Rachel	kept	sneaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">glances.	 She	 was	 out	 of	 my	 range.	 The	 first	 few	 times	 I’d	 seen	 her,	 she	 wore thick	 pants,	 long-sleeved	 shirts.	 This	 time	 she	 was	 in	 that	 red	 leather	 skirt,	 her legs	smooth	and	sexy	all	the	way	to	the	slit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wished	I’d	never	drawn	that	stupid	picture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	said	she	was	going	to	try	out	the	diner.	Heard	they	had	good	burgers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	asked	if	I’d	like	to	go.	She	wanted	to	pretend	this	was	all	just	fucking	fine.	I guess	I	needed	that,	too,	because	I	said	sure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 first	 few	 dates	 were	 intense.	 Neither	 of	 us	 had	 been	 with	 a	 Thought Thief	before	Brightside.	It	amplified	every	quiet	moment.	No	more	pretense.	No</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	lying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	the	bad	shit	felt	good,	because	it	was	true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	accelerated	relationship	let	us	believe	we’d	met	our	soul	mates.	I	didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">even	 care	 when	 I	 received	 Michelle’s	 letter,	 the	 one	 telling	 me	 how	 happy	 she was	 I’d	 been	 taken	 to	 Brightside,	 that	 I	 was	 out	 of	 her	 life.	 She	 said	 she	 felt raped	by	our	relationship,	that	I’d	lied,	stolen	every	private	thought.	She	wanted me	to	die	a	slow,	painful	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	to	hell	with	her.	I	had	Rachel,	someone	who	loved	me	for	me.	It	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	feel	worthy.	It	made	me	better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	did	drawings	for	Danny,	promised	him	one	a	week.	Sometimes	I	gave	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">two.	I	wasn’t	a	real	artist,	but	Danny	liked	them.	They	brightened	his	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	 spent	 my	 whole	 life	 hurting	 and	 disappointing	 other	 people, </p>
<p class="calibre1">manipulating	 them.	 With	 Danny	 I	 just	 had	 to	 move	 my	 pencil.	 Vertical	 and horizontal	lines	flying	across	the	paper.	The	images	took	shape,	a	massive	brick wall	filling	the	page,	a	hawk	soaring	through	the	sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	entire	second	week	in	Brightside,	I’d	sit	on	the	bench	sketching,	put	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	oversized	headphones.	I	knew	people	laughed.	I’d	heard	all	their	silent	jokes, but	I	didn’t	give	a	shit. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a><img src="index-43_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 grabbed	 the	 eraser,	 put	 a	 giant	 hole	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 wall,	 and	 then picked	up	the	blue	pencil.	Brilliant	blue	skies	and	a	luscious	green	meadow	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 other	 side	 of	 the	 wall.	 A	 pile	 of	 broken	 bricks	 gathered	 under	 the	 hole,	 a young	boy	climbing	up	it.	The	boy	had	a	lopsided	grin	on	his	face	as	he	grasped</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	hand	of	an	unseen	man	reaching	through.	Freedom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	not	very	often	I	looked	at	one	of	my	drawings	and	smiled.	They	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">never	 that	 good,	 but	 this	 one	 was	 and	 Danny	 loved	 it.	 All	 he	 needed	 was	 a drawing	to	make	him	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	needed	more,	especially	when	she	heard	me	dreaming	of	Michelle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Day	39	when	I	couldn’t	give	her	the	answer,	because	pretending	was	so	fucking</p>
<p class="calibre1">exhausting.	Then	the	Boots	came	to	take	her	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">TWO	 NIGHTS	 LATER,	 AFTER	 my	 session	 with	 Sharon	 on	 Day	 41,	 I	 found</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself	walking.	I	couldn’t	sleep.	It	wasn’t	as	cold	as	it’d	been	the	day	I	burned my	five-year-old	face,	but	cold	enough	to	snuggle	into	my	jacket	and	zip	it	up	all the	way.	Cold	enough	to	remind	me	my	low	expectations	for	this	place	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	too	high. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Cabin	sat	up	on	the	hill,	where	Rachel	was	most	likely	sitting	in	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">catatonic	 state,	 wondering	 why	 she	 ever	 trusted	 me.	 I	 could	 have	 visited,	 but	 I didn’t	want	to	see	what	I’d	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shoved	both	hands	in	my	pockets	and	went	to	the	railing	overlooking	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">park.	I	leaned	on	it,	but	not	too	far	because	the	weld	looked	weak	and	fifteen	feet was	only	high	enough	to	hurt.	Still,	it	was	too	high.	I	stepped	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brightside	spread	out	before	me,	our	nothing	of	a	town	stuck	on	the	side	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 mountain.	 The	 cemetery	 was	 another	 two	 hundred	 feet	 up.	 Three	 hundred yards	 to	 the	 welcome	 center.	 The	 town	 of	 telepaths	 was	 hard	 at	 work,	 my thoughts	all	my	own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	statue	of	Jonas	Stonebrook	stood	by	the	pond.	Jonas	was	the	founding</p>
<p class="calibre1">father	of	this	place.	His	son,	William,	had	been	branded	a	Thought	Thief.	Some</p>
<p class="calibre1">guy	 shot	 him	 in	 his	 home.	 William	 bled	 out	 on	 his	 bathroom	 floor.	 Jonas	 was old,	angry,	thought	there	was	a	better	way.	He	sold	the	land	up	here	for	a	buck, thought	he	was	giving	the	government	a	humane	option. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 statue	 of	 the	 skinny	 old	 man	 with	 his	 gray	 hair	 and	 scraggly	 beard stood	 stoically	 by	 the	 frozen	 water,	 almost	 like	 he	 was	 lost	 in	 thought.	 I wondered	if	he	regretted	creating	Brightside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stayed	 on	 the	 path	 until	 I	 hit	 the	 woods,	 the	 full	 and	 bright	 moon illuminating	 the	 way.	 I	 headed	 for	 the	 tallest	 tree,	 found	 the	 five	 long	 slashes</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>buried	in	the	bark.	Michelle’s	name	scratched	out.	Rachel’s	name	in	her	place.	I pulled	out	the	knife	I’d	swiped	from	the	diner,	started	scratching	it	out.	I	don’t know	why.	I	suppose	I	was	simply	crossing	off	another	woman,	another	broken</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart,	bullshit	love. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	 told	 myself	 things	 could	 last	 with	 Michelle,	 even	 if	 she	 found	 out	 the truth.	Then	I	tried	to	believe	it	was	even	better	with	Rachel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Always	 pretending.	 Making	 shit	 up	 in	 my	 head	 to	 believe	 I	 had	 a	 chance, that	happiness	was	possible,	even	for	someone	like	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	would	say	my	expectations	were	the	problem,	that	they	were	setting</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	 up	 for	 failure.	 Reality	 can	 never	 live	 up	 to	 your	 imagination.	 Expectations imply	a	future,	which	doesn’t	exist.	There’s	only	the	present. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	day	I	met	Krystal.	I	was	at	the	deli	and	something	smacked	the	tile</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind	 me,	 made	 me	 jump.	 I	 spun	 around	 and	 bumped	 into	 this	 amazing	 ass, grabbed	it	for	balance	so	neither	of	us	fell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal	was	bent	over,	straight-legged,	picking	a	small	box	up	off	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	couldn’t	see	her	face,	but	the	bright	red	hair	gave	Krystal	away.	That	and	her ass	 pointed	 right	 at	 me,	 her	 white	 bakery	 coat	 so	 short	 I	 could	 see	 the	 tiniest strand	of	her	red	thong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	seen	her	a	few	times,	but	always	thought	she	was	too	intimidating,	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">arms	covered	in	tattoos,	her	pierced	nipples	on	full	display	under	that	tight	shirt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 wasn’t	 thinking	 about	 Rachel	 locked	 away	 in	 the	 Cabin.	 I	 also	 wasn’t thinking	about	work	because	I	was	done	for	the	day.	I	was	only	thinking	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	present.	Krystal’s	ass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	let	go	of	it	and	said,	“I’m	sorry.”	I	left	my	hand	on	her	hip	to	help	her	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kept	it	there	because	she	was	nice	to	touch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal	didn’t	pull	away.	She	backed	up	into	me,	gave	me	a	little	bump	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned	around.	I	knew	her	name,	but	we’d	never	been	this	close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	eyes	so	green	I	never	had	a	chance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	let	myself	think	every	nasty	thought,	let	her	know	it	didn’t	bother	me	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	listening.	Krystal	was	used	to	guys	thinking	these	things.	But	they’d	never</p>
<p class="calibre1">say	it	out	loud.	I	wasn’t	either,	but	thinking	it	like	a	roar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 just	 about	 the	 sweetest	 voice	 I’d	 ever	 heard,	 Krystal	 said,	 “Hi	 there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 she	 stuck	 out	 the	 tip	 of	 her	 tongue,	 slid	 it	 all	 the	 way	 around	 to	 wet	 her smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Aren’t	you	different? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">You	have	no	idea. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal	did	the	thing	with	her	tongue	again.	Real	slow.	She	was	sizing	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">up,	taking	in	her	latest	catch.	“You	doing	anything	right	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	Couldn’t	believe	what	was	happening,	but	I	was	standing</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>right	there,	letting	my	thoughts	cascade.	She	loved	it.	Krystal	wanted	to	fuck	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	couldn’t	wait	to	oblige.	I	pointed	at	her	uniform.	“Aren’t	you	working?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	do	whatever	I	want.”	She	took	off	her	work	coat	and	headed	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">door.	“You	coming?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 holy-shit-this-is-really-happening	 happiness	 shattered.	 Sheila,	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1">nosey	bitch	from	work,	stood	four	feet	away.	She	was	friends	with	Rachel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal	walked	by	Sheila,	completely	ignored	her.	Krystal	wasn’t	ashamed</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 hadn’t	 said	 a	 word	 about	 Charlie,	 the	 guy	 she	 was	 dating.	 I	 hadn’t	 said	 a word	about	Rachel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sheila	looked	down	at	her	watch,	her	long	brunette	hair	hiding	her	face.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t	 want	 to	 see	 me.	 She	 hadn’t	 meant	 to	 overhear.	 She	 wouldn’t	 tell	 anyone else.	She	promised.	My	new	attitude	turned	Sheila	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal	pulled	me	out	the	door	and	paraded	me	back	to	her	place.	Neither	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">us	giving	a	shit	what	anyone	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lodge	Two	was	the	exact	duplicate	of	my	building.	Walking	to	work	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning,	I	could	see	right	through	every	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal’s	 room	 was	 halfway	 down	 on	 the	 left	 side,	 right	 in	 the	 middle, overlooking	the	park.	Right	where	she	wanted	it	so	everyone	could	see	what	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pinned	her	up	against	the	wall,	ripped	her	underwear	off	like	she	said	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	fell	on	the	floor,	did	things	to	each	other	I’ve	never	even	imagined. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	felt	nothing	but	the	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 used	 to	 feel	 guilt.	 Women	 would	 look	 at	 me,	 their	 minds	 giving	 away secrets,	a	map	into	their	pants.	I’d	take	advantage,	use	their	thoughts	to	get	them in	bed.	They	never	knew	what	a	dirtbag	I	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Krystal	knew	and	she	fucking	loved	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course,	I	ruined	it.	It’s	what	I	do.	We’d	just	finished,	both	of	us	sweaty, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	sheets	all	bunched	up.	She	thought	about	the	last	time	she’d	done	something</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	this,	back	in	Vegas,	no	holes	barred	at	the	Green	Door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wondered	if	anyone	could	count	the	number	of	men	who’d	seen	Krystal’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">tits.	How	many	tourists	had	stuffed	dollar	bills	into	her	G-string,	let	their	hands linger,	feel	her	soft	skin?	How	many	men	had	she	gotten	hard,	whispered	in	their ears,	telling	them	every	dirty	thing	they	wanted	to	hear? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal	rolled	over	and	tugged	up	her	panties.	“Fuck.	You.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sorry.	I	didn’t	mean	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	always	thinking	about	everything	the	wrong	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 answers	 didn’t	 matter.	 None	 of	 it	 did.	 Krystal	 used	 what	 she	 had	 to trick	men	into	handing	over	fistfuls	of	cash.	It	wasn’t	any	different	than	what	I did	at	BMW.	Krystal	didn’t	judge	me	for	how	I	made	my	money.	I	had	no	right</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a><img src="index-46_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">to	question	her.	But	there	I	was,	doing	the	same	shit	I	always	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal	threw	my	clothes	at	me.	“Get	the	fuck	out!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 other	 women,	 I’d	 deluded	 myself	 into	 thinking	 it	 was	 okay	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">manipulate	them.	It	made	up	for	all	the	terrible	things	I	had	to	hear.	Krystal	felt the	 same,	 but	 she	 didn’t	 want	 to	 listen	 to	 my	 bullshit	 thoughts.	 She	 kicked	 me out,	me	hopping	around	with	one	pant	leg	on,	trying	to	slip	in	the	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	she	slammed	the	door	I	looked	at	Krystal.	Really	looked	at	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal	was	her	hair.	Torch	crimson.	Fire	red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal	was	her	clothes.	Bakery	jacket	a	size	too	small,	no	bra	underneath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	sweatshirt	Couture,	proving	she	was	worth	every	penny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal	was	her	face.	Beautiful.	Molded.	Injected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal	was	Mom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	what	I	thought	about	as	I	hopped	out	of	the	building.	The	way	Mom</p>
<p class="calibre1">loved	to	go	to	church	to	shake	her	ass	for	all	the	lonely	men,	just	like	Krystal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	WAS	FIVE,	TWO	DAYS	after	I’d	been	lost	in	the	snow,	my	cheeks	burnt	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">basted	 with	 butter.	 Mom	 took	 me	 to	 church	 wearing	 her	 tightest	 red	 dress,	 the one	 that	 pushed	 her	 boobs	 up,	 the	 thin	 black	 bra	 straps	 peeking	 out	 from	 the shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	 never	 went	 to	 church	 with	 us.	 “No,	 I	 think	 I’m	 going	 to	 pass,”	 he’d say.	 “Maybe	 I’ll	 go	 later.”	 But	 he	 never	 went	 anywhere	 with	 large	 groups.	 I didn’t	understand	why. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	opened	the	church	door	super	slow,	loving	the	loud	creak	that	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost	everyone	turn	around	and	look.	Especially	the	men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	I	wanted	was	to	not	be	noticed,	embarrassed	of	my	cheeks.	Not	Mom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 wasn’t	 there	 to	 blend.	 She	 was	 there	 to	 be	 coveted	 so	 she	 got	 her	 hips swinging	back	and	forth	even	further. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Teenage	 boys	 sat	 up	 straighter.	 Men	 pretended	 they	 were	 looking	 at	 the sorry	little	kid	behind	her.	Women	shook	their	heads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	we	got	to	the	third	row,	Mom	did	something	with	her	hand,	touching</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 face	 once,	 her	 chest	 three	 times.	 The	 row	 was	 full.	 No	 one	 moved,	 just pretended	 they	 didn’t	 see	 Mom	 standing	 there	 in	 her	 blood	 of	 Christ	 red	 dress, the	black	beneath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	squeezed	in,	pulled	me	beside	her,	my	shoulder	rubbing	her	arm,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">closest	we’d	been	in	a	while.	The	bench	was	harder	than	anything	I’d	sat	on,	the reason	I	thought	so	many	people	were	on	their	knees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	 saw	 me	 looking	 at	 the	 exit	 and	 pointed	 down	 by	 my	 feet.	 She</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a><img src="index-47_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">whispered,	“Pray	for	your	sins.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	got	down,	glad	to	be	further	away	from	her	perfume	and	thoughts.	But	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard	the	others,	all	the	scary	shit	they	were	thinking.	I	heard	them	pray	for	the dying,	the	dead,	for	a	piece	of	my	mom’s	ass,	for	forgiveness	of	sins,	for	winning the	damn	lottery,	swearing	they’d	donate	some.	Some	guys	were	thinking	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">sex	or	their	fantasy	football	teams.	A	teenager	thought	I	was	lucky	I	got	to	suck on	Mom’s	tits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	blocked	the	voices	by	doing	my	own	thinking,	wondering	what	a	sin	was, </p>
<p class="calibre1">figuring	I	probably	had	a	bunch	of	them,	way	more	than	my	share.	I	wasn’t	sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">how	 to	 pray,	 but	 guessed	 it	 was	 like	 wishing,	 just	 another	 thing	 that	 wouldn’t come	true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	said	that	was	enough	and	pulled	me	back	towards	the	people	behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">me,	all	their	thoughts	filling	my	head,	making	me	want	to	smash	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 pressed	 my	 hands	 to	 my	 eyes	 to	 help	 quiet	 the	 voices.	 Especially	 Mom who	 was	 thinking	 about	 the	 man	 in	 front	 of	 us,	 the	 one	 with	 two	 kids,	 but	 no wife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	cheeks	still	stung	when	I	pushed	on	them.	Mom	hit	my	arm.	I	put	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands	back	on	my	lap	and	there	were	huge	flakes	of	skin	sticking	to	my	fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 rubbed	 my	 hand	 on	 my	 pants	 then	 touched	 my	 face	 to	 see	 if	 there	 was more.	 Every	 time	 my	 hand	 came	 down,	 more	 pieces	 came	 with	 it,	 each	 one bigger	than	the	one	before.	My	cheeks	were	shedding	skin.	I	prayed	my	whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">body	would	do	that.	Just	rub	away.	The	whole	thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	kept	trying	until	Mom	saw	the	mess	covering	my	pants.	She	grabbed	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand,	jerked	it	away	from	my	face,	and	squeezed	it,	hard.	She	looked	right	at	me, at	the	big	patches	under	each	eye.	“I	can’t	take	you	anywhere,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	didn’t	hear	me.	She	was	too	busy	pushing	me	out	of	the	pew,	saying</p>
<p class="calibre1">excuse	 me	 as	 we	 stormed	 out,	 some	 people	 thinking	 what	 a	 terrible	 mother dragging	her	diseased	son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WHEN	I	STEPPED	OUT	onto	the	Square,	I	kept	thinking	about	Mom,	Krystal, </p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 tits	 and	 asses.	 That’s	 what	 I	 was	 thinking	 when	 I	 almost	 bumped	 into Wayne	 King.	 	 His	 eyes	 smiling	 above	 all	 that	 beard,	 spilling	 over	 his	 orange jumpsuit. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Mommy	and	your	girlfriend...fucking	nice. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	 leaned	 on	 his	 snow	 shovel,	 his	 eyes	 never	 leaving	 me,	 not	 even when	 the	 guard	 took	 notice,	 started	 walking	 past	 the	 dozen	 other	 people	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>jumpsuits.	 The	 people	 who’d	 snapped	 long	 before	 Brightside.	 They’d	 killed people,	robbed	banks,	tortured.	Everyone’s	thoughts	infected	their	brains,	turned them	into	savages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	 Brightsiders	 cheated.	 They	 scammed,	 got	 women	 into	 the	 sack, </p>
<p class="calibre1">drained	a	guy’s	life	savings.	Some	just	used	it	to	win	at	charades. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing	violent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	like	the	ones	in	orange.	The	only	people	here	kept	behind	bars,	allowed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 work	 outside	 if	 they	 were	 good.	 Normal	 prisons	 couldn’t	 hold	 them.	 They always	found	a	way	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	 knew	 the	 Brightside	 guard	 was	 coming,	 already	 telling	 him	 to	 get back	to	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 just	 four	 feet	 away,	 I	 heard	 Wayne’s	 thoughts	 loud	 and	 clear.	 That	 I looked	like	his	favorite	victim.	The	one	he	gutted	real	good	and	scooped	out	the insides.	Turned	the	belly	into	his	outhouse.	The	one	he	filled	up	then	left	for	the bears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	victim	had	looked	at	him	wrong.	Thought	he	needed	a	bath.	That’s	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">kind	of	sick	fuck	Wayne	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	said,	“We	should	find	some	time	to	talk	more	about	your	mom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guard	ran	up.	“We	have	a	problem,	King?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	problem	at	all,	sir.”	Wayne	went	back	to	shoveling	snow.	He	whistled</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	image	of	my	mom	and	Krystal’s	naked	bodies	rolling	around	on	the	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tried	not	to	run	back	to	my	place,	tried	to	get	Wayne’s	sick	thoughts	out	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 head.	 Everything	 was	 spinning,	 my	 head,	 stomach.	 I	 couldn’t	 breathe.	 I’d heard	enough	twisted	shit	in	my	life	to	fill	a	canyon.	People	weren’t	as	innocent as	 we’re	 led	 to	 believe.	 They	 think	 about	 horrifying	 acts.	 But	 they’re	 just thoughts,	fleeting	desires.	Wayne	King	followed	through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 image	 of	 Mom	 and	 Krystal	 knocking	 around	 my	 brain.	 I’d	 never</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	 of	 Mom	 that	 way.	 Other	 men	 had.	 So	 many	 others.	 Did	 I	 crave	 that attention?	Is	that	why	I	chose	the	women	I	did? </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	thoughts	were	interrupted	by	the	strangest	thing:	a	present	at	my	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	medium	box	wrapped	so	poorly	I	assumed	it	was	from	Danny.	Then	I	noticed</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’d	 been	 opened	 and	 rewrapped.	 Brightside	 inspected	 every	 gift	 from	 the outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	from	my	dad. </p>

<p class="calibre1">DAY	100	AND	I’M	POURING	bleach.	I	have	no	idea	if	it’s	covering	the	smell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve	 been	 inhaling	 it	 too	 long,	 even	 with	 the	 shirt	 wrapped	 around	 my	 mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	just	so	much	blood,	all	the	little	hunks	of	flesh.	On	the	ceiling,	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	just	need	this	to	buy	us	some	time	in	case	they	come	looking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	 air	 fresheners	 are	 on	 that	 table.	 I	 plug	 the	 first	 one	 in	 beside	 the dresser.	 Can’t	 even	 glance	 at	 the	 closet	 when	 I	 pass	 by	 on	 my	 way	 to	 the bathroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	closet.	The	fucking	closet... </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	take	a	deep	breath,	clear	out	the	bad	thoughts.	I	get	in	the	shower.	Scrub</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	hard	I	think	I’m	going	to	peel	off	my	skin	like	that	stupid	kid	in	church.	Soon, everything	 is	 wiped,	 as	 good	 as	 it’s	 going	 to	 get.	 My	 watch	 says	 I	 have	 ten minutes	to	make	it	to	work.	The	last	day	I’ll	ever	step	foot	in	that	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	shirt’s	hanging	on	the	chair.	Blood-free.	I	put	it	on,	ignore	all	the	cracks</p>
<p class="calibre1">overhead,	and	step	in	front	of	the	full-length	mirror.	Need	to	make	sure	I	don’t look	like	someone	who	just	stepped	out	of	a	slaughterhouse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	shoes	are	beat	up	but	have	enough	tread	to	make	it	through	the	snow,	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	hillside.	My	wrinkle-free	khakis	aren’t	slacks,	but	they’re	ironed.	My	pearl-white	 button-down	 with	 its	 crisp	 collar	 the	 only	 thing	 making	 me	 feel	 like	 the salesman	I	used	to	be.	The	guy	I’m	really	going	to	have	to	be	today	to	pull	this off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	check	the	contents	of	my	bag:	sunglasses,	iPod,	my	oversized	headphones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Necessities	for	surviving	Brightside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	look	back	at	the	closet.	If	anyone	comes	in	here,	we’re	screwed.	I’ve	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">running	through	the	plan	in	my	head,	but	every	time	it	ends	badly,	so	fucked	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	makes	me	think	I	should	just	grab	the	shotgun	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	still	have	to	come	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	head	for	the	door.	The	knob	is	cold.	Nothing	compared	to	the	little	world</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	other	side,	but	I’m	going	to	face	it.	Day	100.	Ready	or	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	beat	up	shoes	crunch	two	pieces	of	broken	gifts	on	the	floor.	So	many</p>
<p class="calibre1">pieces	I	had	to	puzzle	together.	What	Dad	really	wanted.	My	chance	to	get	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	think	it	all	started	with	that	fucking	fish. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a><img src="index-50_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	DON’T	REMEMBER	HOW	long	I	sat	on	my	bed	with	Dad’s	gift	on	Day	44. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fingering	the	re-taped	paper,	that	sad	little	bow	mashed	down	and	frayed.	He’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">never	wrapped	anything	when	I	was	a	kid.	Just	handed	me	the	Rite-Aid	bag,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">contents	visible	through	the	cheap,	white	plastic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	 been	 in	 Brightside	 a	 month	 and	 a	 half	 and	 my	 parents	 hadn’t	 written, hadn’t	called,	so	seeing	this	gift	filled	me	with	dread.	My	father	loved	to	lecture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pictured	some	hand-carved	sign	that	read,	“Told	You	So!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	 I	 unwrapped	 it.	 Tore	 off	 the	 paper.	 That	 stupid	 fish	 staring	 at	 me, head	twisted	to	the	left,	that	tiny	red	button	telling	me	to	press	it.	I	did,	and	Billy Bass	sang,	“Take	Me	to	the	River.”	Tail	flapping,	mouth	opening	and	closing	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	Green’s	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	wasn’t	known	for	practical	jokes.	I’d	only	seen	him	laugh	a	few</p>
<p class="calibre1">times	as	a	kid.	He	never	bought	me	anything	fun	to	play	with,	unless	it	had	to	do with	 hunting	 or	 fishing,	 but	 even	 then,	 he	 lectured	 me	 on	 responsibility	 and sucked	 all	 the	 fun	 right	 out	 of	 it.	 We	 went	 on	 a	 few	 fishing	 trips	 to	 the	 Black River	 in	 Ohio.	 Father-son	 weekends	 because	 Mom	 said	 it’d	 be	 good	 for	 us.	 I knew	it	was	just	so	she	could	have	men	sleep	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	WAS	SEVEN	THE	FIRST	time	I	saw	a	real	fish.	Dad	dressed	the	part	in	full-</p>
<p class="calibre1">length	waders	and	a	black	vest	with	pockets	so	he	could	stay	in	the	middle	of	the river	all	day.	I	wished	he	would	have. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	had	just	reeled	in	a	fish	the	size	of	my	forearm,	brought	it	to	the	bank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pointed	at	the	flopping	flounder.	“See	that,	Joe?	Look	at	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	it	doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	took	off	his	hat	to	wipe	his	forehead.	He	knelt	down	beside	me	and	put</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	hand	on	my	shoulder.	“Its	finale.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	though	Dad	never	got	this	close,	all	I	could	think	about	was	the	fish.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew	 fish	 couldn’t	 talk	 like	 Billy	 Bass,	 but	 this	 one	 was	 screaming,	 trying	 to snap	its	spine.	I	told	Dad,	“Put	it	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“PUT	IT	BACK	IN	THE	WATER!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 fish	 flailed	 and	 Dad	 caught	 it	 in	 mid-air.	 He	 put	 its	 wriggling	 belly	 a few	inches	from	my	face.	“You	see	that	hook?	Look,	son,	I	want	you	to	see	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	wanna.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Open	your	eyes,”	Dad	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Goddamnit,	look! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	 turned	 my	 chin	 back	 to	 the	 fish,	 down	 its	 mouth.	 Pink	 goo	 pushing</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a><img src="index-51_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="index-51_2.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">around	both	sides	of	the	shiny	red	metal.	It	was	impossible	to	see	anything	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See	how	it	went	right	through?	Even	if	I	could	free	the	hook,	I’d	tear	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	insides	getting	it	out.	I	can’t	put	this	guy	back.”	The	fish	kept	fighting.	Dad’s hand	squeezing	so	tight	the	eyes	were	going	to	pop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	part	of	the	hook	poking	out	wasn’t	that	big.	I	figured	the	fish	would	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">okay	if	it	got	back	in	the	water.	I	said,	“Try	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.”	He	set	the	slowing	fish	against	the	ground.	His	other	hand	reached	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	side,	brought	out	the	knife	I’d	never	seen	unfolded.	“It’s	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	knife	ripped	through	the	air.	Ripped	through	the	fish.	Its	severed	head</p>
<p class="calibre1">tilted	onto	its	side,	one	big	eye	staring,	accusing,	saying,	Remember	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	wiped	the	blade	on	the	grass,	acted	like	it	was	no	big	deal.	Then	he	got</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	and	walked	back	into	the	river,	sang	some	stupid	song	about	rolly,	polly	fish heads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	he	did	have	a	twisted	sense	of	humor	after	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">BILLY	BASS’S	SONG	ENDED	on	my	lap,	the	batteries	almost	drained.	There</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	two	more	giant	D-Cell	batteries	inside	the	package,	but	I	saw	no	reason	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">continue	 Dad’s	 joke.	 Billy	 Bass	 would	 sit	 in	 my	 closet	 until	 Day	 74	 when everything	finally	made	sense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	know	my	father	was	trying	to	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 WAS	 IN	 FOURTH	 GRADE	 playing	 football	 in	 the	 field	 behind	 the	 school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corey	 and	 Gilbert	 versus	 Steven	 and	 me.	 	 They	 were	 bigger,	 faster,	 stronger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 won	 every	 time.	 I	 never	 cheated	 because	 at	 least	 they	 let	 us	 play,	 and	 it stopped	them	from	picking	on	us	during	class.	They’d	beat	us	up	and	taunt	us	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	field,	but	basically	leave	us	alone	afterwards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	day	we	were	tied.	It	was	their	ball,	fourth	down,	five	feet	from	the	goal</p>
<p class="calibre1">line	 that	 ran	 between	 the	 two	 baseball	 backstops.	 I	 stayed	 away	 from	 their huddle,	but	had	a	good	idea	what	they	were	going	to	run.	Something	tricky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 that	 point,	 I	 was	 prepared	 for	 the	 loss,	 Corey’s	 hooting	 and	 hollering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	stupid	dance	he	did.	Plus,	it	was	hot	and	I	was	sweaty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	broke	huddle.	Corey	went	to	the	ball,	Gilbert	all	the	way	to	the	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 bell	 rang	 and	 Steven	 started	 walking	 for	 the	 blacktop,	 acting	 brave	 in my	 old	 Star	 Wars	 shirt	 I’d	 given	 him	 because	 he	 kept	 staring	 at	 it	 when	 he’d come	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	Steven	actually	talked	smack.	“Guess	you	don’t	win	this	time,	Corey.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>Corey	held	out	his	arm,	kept	Steven	back	without	touching	him.	“No	way, Hong	Kong.	One	more	play.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steven	pointed	at	the	classroom	way	on	the	other	side	of	the	school.	“The</p>
<p class="calibre1">bell	rang.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corey	kept	his	arm	out.	“No	shit,	Sherlock.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,	Corey,	let	him	go,”	I	said.	“It’s	either	a	tie	or	we’ll	finish	next</p>
<p class="calibre1">week.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop	 being	 such	 a	 muff,	 Joe”	 Corey	 said.	 He	 walked	 to	 the	 line	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">scrimmage	and	backed	Steven	up	behind	the	ball. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gilbert,	in	his	Columbus	Conquerors’	t-shirt	and	matching	shorts,	got	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">special	stance	he’d	learned	at	camp.	“Yeah.	Mr.	Mosley’s	always	late.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 blacktop	 was	 covered	 with	 kids,	 only	 a	 teacher	 or	 two.	 “We	 still	 got time,”	I	said.	“Come	on,	Steven.	It’ll	be	quick.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steven	 pulled	 at	 his	 baggy	 shirt,	 the	 Luke	 Skywalker	 iron-on	 so	 faded	 it almost	 wasn’t	 there.	 It	 sounded	 like	 he	 might	 cry,	 something	 a	 fourth	 grader should	never	do.	“I	have	to	change.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Change	later,	chinker-dinker.”	Corey	squatted	down	and	grabbed	the	ball. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Last	play.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steven	finally	shut	up,	his	thoughts	shouting	into	my	head:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Fucking	Pecker!	If	you	get	near	me	I’m	going	to	kick	you	in	the	balls. </i> Make it	so	Corey	could	never	make	fun	of	him	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	knew	if	Steven	tried	it,	he’d	miss.	He	was	the	most	uncoordinated	kid</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 class,	 his	 belly	 round	 and	 jiggly	 because	 his	 mom	 made	 him	 pork	 dumpling nearly	every	night.	I	knew	Corey	would	beat	the	piss	out	of	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corey	squished	up	his	face	so	his	eyes	were	almost	closed.	“Ohhhh,	me	so	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">scared.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steven	 made	 a	 noise,	 almost	 sounded	 like	 a	 growl.	 Corey	 laughed	 and	 I knew	what	Steven	was	going	to	do.	That’s	what	made	me	do	it.	What	made	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">become	 the	 cheat	 Dad	 always	 warned	 me	 not	 to.	 I	 asked	 Gilbert,	 “Whatcha’</p>
<p class="calibre1">running?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gilbert	smiled,	thought	there	was	no	way	I’d	be	ready	for	the	flea	flicker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corey	hut,	hut,	hutted	and	hiked	the	ball.	Gilbert	pretended	to	run	forward, </p>
<p class="calibre1">put	 on	 his	 best	 fakeout	 face.	 He	 was	 supposed	 to	 come	 back	 behind	 the	 line, catch	the	lateral,	throw	it	back	to	Corey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	clear.	So	goddamn	easy.	I	jumped	in	front	of	the	pass,	picked	it	off	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">hauled	ass	for	the	blacktop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corey	shouted	a	super	loud,	“Fuck!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	race	was	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	goal	line	was	between	the	swings	and	monkey	bars,	still	half	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>field	 away.	 Gilbert	 and	 Corey	 were	 both	 faster	 than	 me,	 but	 I	 had	 a	 lead, pumping	my	arms	as	fast	as	I	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 didn’t	 need	 to	 look	 back	 to	 know	 Gilbert	 was	 just	 a	 few	 feet	 away, thinking	about	diving	for	my	legs.	Corey	was	next	to	him,	wanting	to	teach	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	one	beat	him.	Especially	some	little	white	pussy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 zigged	 to	 the	 left.	 Gilbert	 dropped,	 face-planted.	 I	 zagged	 and	 Corey tripped	 over	 Gilbert.	 The	 goal	 line	 was	 less	 than	 twenty	 feet	 away,	 Corey stumbling	 to	 grab	 my	 shirt.	 I	 spun.	 Corey	 fell.	 And	 I	 backpedaled	 into	 the	 end zone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	spike	was	the	biggest	Fuck	You	I’d	ever	delivered.	I	slammed	it	hard, </p>
<p class="calibre1">yelled,	“Touchdown!”	loud	enough	that	even	the	kids	sick	at	home	would	hear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corey	popped	off	the	grass	and	ran	over.	“No	way.	It	doesn’t	count.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steven	slapped	me	a	high	five.	“Yeah,	it	does,”	he	said.	“We	win.”	He	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	ridiculous	robot	dance,	the	one	he’d	been	perfecting	at	home	in	front	of	the mirror.	He	looked	like	a	spaz,	but	I’d	never	seen	him	happier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 kids	 were	 filing	 into	 the	 school.	 I	 told	 Steven	 we	 needed	 to	 go.	 He finally	stopped	dancing,	bent	over	to	pick	up	his	notepad	and	school	clothes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corey	charged	and	pushed	him	to	his	knees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steven	got	up	and	brushed	off	the	grass,	saw	the	stain	he	wouldn’t	be	able</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	explain	to	his	parents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	the	hell,	Corey?	Why’d	you	push	him?”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cause	 he’s	 a	 crybaby	 and	 a	 cheater.	 You	 both	 are.	 The	 touchdown	 didn’t count.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	counted	and	we	won.	End	of	story.”	I	told	Steven,	“Come	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steven	held	up	his	perfectly	folded	shirt	that	almost	matched	his	cheeks.	“I</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	to	change.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	 wrong?”	 Corey	 asked.	 “Hong	 Kong	 don’t	 want	 to	 show	 off	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">chee-chees?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">None	 of	 us	 liked	 changing	 in	 public,	 but	 the	 thought	 crippled	 Steven,	 left him	standing	there	holding	the	shirt,	waiting	to	be	told	what	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	 on,	 dude,	 everyone’s	 already	 in	 line,”	 I	 said.	 “The	 second	 bell’s gonna	ring	any	second.	I’ll	stand	right	here.	No	one’s	even	looking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gilbert	 pointed	 at	 the	 principal’s	 office	 way	 at	 the	 other	 end	 of	 school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	Mosley.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Mosley	was	talking	to	Miss	Shannon.	She	was	leaning	against	the	wall, </p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 bodies	 pretty	 close.	 They	 could’ve	 been	 talking	 about	 anything	 but	 it	 was probably	 about	 his	 divorce,	 why	 he	 didn’t	 get	 one	 yet.	 I’d	 heard	 disgusting things	when	they	stared	at	each	other	in	the	cafeteria. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hurry	up,	Steven,”	I	said.	“I	don’t	want	to	be	late.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>Corey	kept	pushing	Steven,	who	was	losing	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shrieked,	“Go	away,	Corey.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	 got	 all	 day.	 Bitch	 Hudson	 gave	 me	 detention	 this	 morning.	 What’s Mosley	 going	 to	 do?”	 Corey	 showed	 how	 white	 his	 teeth	 were	 with	 a	 giant smile.	“Come	on,	Hong	Kong,	let	me	see	those	titties.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steven	silently	whispered	my	name	to	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	didn’t	have	many	options.	I	told	him	to	just	change.	“Mosley’s	saying</p>
<p class="calibre1">goodbye.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steven	slipped	the	shirt	off	his	head	and	started	to	put	on	his	nice	one,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">Corey	ran	past	me,	grabbed	hold	of	each	shirt,	and	ripped	them	free.	I	turned	but Corey	was	already	running.	Steven	took	off	after	him,	his	toothpick	arms	flying</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	and	forth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corey	ran	around	the	jungle	gym,	jumped	over	the	sand	pit,	hit	the	blacktop</p>
<p class="calibre1">full	stride.	He	was	an	athlete	and	an	asshole. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steven	 gave	 up,	 kicked	 at	 the	 sand,	 arms	 folded	 over	 his	 chest.	 It	 was probably	for	the	best.	I	don’t	know	what	he	could	have	done	if	he	caught	Corey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 Corey	 got	 halfway	 to	 the	 classroom,	 he	 glanced	 over	 his	 shoulder, gave	a	big	smile.	Then	he	had	to	go	and	raise	both	hands,	the	shirts	flying	behind him,	making	sure	everyone	saw	him	coming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	fourth	graders	were	already	in	two	lines	leading	to	the	classroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corey	ran	through	the	middle	of	them	and	yelled,	“Here	come	the	cheaters!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	turned	to	see	who	he	was	talking	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corey	 stood	 at	 the	 front	 of	 the	 class.	 “You	 just	 gonna	 stand	 there?”	 He wasn’t	talking	to	Steven.	His	brown	eyes	were	on	me.	“Or	are	you	gonna	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">help	your	rice-jammer	butt-buddy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	hard	to	talk	with	everyone	watching,	but	I	managed.	“Give	him	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	stuff.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corey	 held	 up	 the	 Star	 Wars	 shirt.	 “Hong	 Kong	 even	 wears	 your	 clothes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	else	you	two	doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	kids	laughed,	mostly	the	guys.	But	Gina,	the	girl	I	had	a	crush	on,	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">right	there,	a	few	feet	away	at	the	end	of	the	line.	She	didn’t	think	it	was	funny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	thought	Corey	was	a	jerk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	“You	mean	besides	beating	you	at	football?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	bunch	of	people	oohed.	Someone	said	Corey	got	burned.	Corey	just	got</p>
<p class="calibre1">mad	and	made	his	nostrils	get	even	bigger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	we	played	tackle,	you	pussies	would	never	score.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Guess	we’ll	never	know.	Can	he	have	his	shirt	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corey	acted	like	he	didn’t	hear	me	and	wrapped	the	Star	Wars	shirt	around</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 fist.	 “Tell	 everyone	 why	 you	 won’t	 play	 tackle.	 Is	 it	 because	 your	 mommy</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>and	daddy	won’t	let	you	or	because	you’re	chickenshit?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	behind,	the	place	he	always	seemed	to	be,	Steven	said,	“Forget	it,	Joe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Mosley	will	be	here	in	a	minute.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corey	came	closer.	The	lines	moved,	formed	into	a	circle.	Corey	pounded</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	shirt	hand	onto	his	palm.	“Shut	up,	you	stupid	chink,”	he	said.	“Go	run	home to	your	momma-san.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	glad	I	couldn’t	see	Steven’s	face	turn	red,	his	eyes	tear	up.	The	others</p>
<p class="calibre1">could,	 though,	 and	 almost	 all	 of	 them	 thought	 it	 was	 funny.	 But	 not	 Gina.	 She told	Corey	to	shut	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corey	 smiled.	 He	 thought	 no	 one	 was	 going	 to	 say	 anything.	 “Aw,	 does	 a girl	have	to	fight	your	battles?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	 got	 kind	 of	 blurry,	 except	 Corey	 and	 his	 big	 fucking	 mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	had	to	be	said.	No	one	else	was	going	to	say	it	so	I	did.	“At	least	he has	a	mom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corey	started	to	shake,	his	eyes	got	all	big.	“Your	mom’s	a	WHORE!”	Spit</p>
<p class="calibre1">flew	off	his	lips.	“And	you’re	a	little-dick	honky,	just	like	your	dad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	first	punch	I	ever	threw.	He	never	saw	it	coming.	Connected	full</p>
<p class="calibre1">on,	 knocked	 Corey’s	 head	 back.	 He	 tried	 to	 swing,	 but	 couldn’t	 land	 anything, didn’t	 look	 like	 such	 a	 great	 athlete	 with	 me	 rushing	 him	 through	 the	 circle, throwing	him	into	the	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Corey’s	eyes	were	closed	when	his	head	smacked	against	the	brick.	His	lip</p>
<p class="calibre1">split	 on	 the	 next	 punch,	 shot	 blood	 everywhere.	 The	 third	 punch	 dropped	 him hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kids	screamed	for	me	to	stop,	a	couple	said,	“Fuck	him	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	obliged.	Got	on	top	of	Corey’s	chest	and	kept	punching	his	face.	Made	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	he	wouldn’t	ever	say	anything	about	anyone’s	mom	again.	Then	I	grabbed	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">head	and	slammed	it	into	the	ground	so	he	wouldn’t	even	think	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	giant	hand	flung	me	off	and	I	smacked	into	the	wall.	Mr.	Mosley	got	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	knees,	wiped	the	blood	off	Corey’s	face.	He	told	Gina	to	get	the	nurse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	was	called. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	suspended.	We	drove	home	in	silence.	I’d	rarely	heard	his	thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	always	kept	his	distance,	seemed	to	move	when	I	got	in	range. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 was	 afraid	 to	 listen	 in	 the	 car,	 already	 knew	 he	 was	 pissed.	 He	 told	 Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mosley	the	suspension	wasn’t	nearly	as	bad	as	what	I	had	coming	at	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 we	 passed	 by	 the	 high	 school’s	 football	 field,	 I	 thought	 back	 to	 our game,	spiking	the	ball.	Steven’s	robot	dance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	was	so	pissed	he	could	barely	speak.	“I	told	you	never	to	cheat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	told	you	 <i class="calibre4">never	</i> to	cheat!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>I	hadn’t	mentioned	the	game	to	Mr.	Mosley	or	my	dad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	 I’m	 going	 to	 make	 this	 real	 goddamn	 clear.	 If	 you	 ever	 pull	 that	 shit again	at	school,	with	your	friends,	with	anyone...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could	hear	his	guilty	thoughts,	the	ones	about	whipping	me	with	his	belt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dad?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I’m	sorry.	I	should	have	told	you. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">And	right	there	I	learned	I	wasn’t	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	pulled	the	car	over	and	told	me	the	truth.	Some	of	it	was	out	loud.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">rest	was	just	between	us.	He	said	Mom	didn’t	need	to	know.	She	knew	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">About	 him.	 But	 not	 about	 me.	 It’d	 be	 too	 much	 to	 handle.	 I	 had	 to	 keep	 it	 in check,	had	to	learn	to	control	myself,	hide	what	I	could	do	to	keep	us	safe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’d	split	us	up,	send	me	to	live	in	an	orphanage.	My	father	would	lose</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	job,	the	one	he	hated,	but	it	put	food	on	the	table,	a	roof	over	our	heads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 asked	 if	 there	 were	 others.	 He	 told	 me	 there	 were,	 but	 that	 we	 should never	associate,	never	seek	them	out.	The	world	was	already	starting	to	learn	the truth.	Soon	they’d	start	coming	for	us.	Brightside	didn’t	exist	yet.	But	there’d	be repercussions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	 said	 people	 were	 being	 institutionalized.	 Thrown	 in	 nuthouses.	 Like my	grandmother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	she	lived	in	Florida?”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	does.	Just	not	in	a	condo.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	entire	life,	I	thought	Dad	hated	me.	Turns	out,	he	was	just	scared,	trying</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	protect	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	that,	things	changed.	We	went	on	more	trips.	He	helped	me	be	a	better</p>
<p class="calibre1">son,	giving	me	silent	instructions	to	help	Mom	in	the	kitchen	with	the	dishes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	showed	me	how	to	hunt.	Taught	me	to	field-strip	a	shotgun.	Bolt	always</p>
<p class="calibre1">rounded-side	up.	Center	the	hook	in	the	receiver.	The	slide	should	drop	right	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	learned	all	this	in	the	War.	He	said	it	was	the	last	time	he’d	abused	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">ability.	It	saved	his	life,	but	got	his	platoon	killed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	shotgun	was	my	grandfather’s.	A	Mossberg	12-gauge.	American	metal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	took	me	to	the	range,	let	me	fire	it.	The	kick	nearly	ripped	off	my	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	never	wanted	to	shoot	it	again.	Dad	said,	“Never	let	fear	take	control.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	loved	to	lecture.	I	was	young	enough	to	listen,	just	couldn’t	put	it	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">action.	 I	 didn’t	 tell	 anyone	 what	 I	 could	 do,	 but	 I	 couldn’t	 stop	 hearing	 others’</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughts.	I’d	hear	answers	for	tests.	When	I	discovered	Lacy	liked	me	in	seventh grade,	I	got	my	first	kiss.	I	couldn’t	turn	off	the	thoughts,	no	matter	how	many times	 Dad	 told	 me	 I	 could.	 He	 said	 I	 just	 had	 to	 focus	 my	 mind.	 We	 got	 into fights.	I	ran	away	twice.	Came	back	only	to	fight	some	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	moved	out	for	good	at	seventeen,	Dad	begged	me	to	reconsider.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a><img src="index-57_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t	want	to	be	left	alone	with	Mom.	He	grew	paranoid.	Refused	to	leave	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">house.	 He’d	 call	 me	 at	 odd	 hours	 once	 he	 heard	 about	 Brightside.	 He	 sent	 me articles	 about	 the	 town,	 but	 always	 hidden	 on	 the	 back	 of	 an	 article	 about something	 else:	 fishing,	 a	 new	 vodka,	 the	 risks	 of	 smoking.	 He	 didn’t	 want	 to draw	suspicions,	said	I	couldn’t	either.	I	didn’t	want	to	hear	it.	I	told	him	I	was smart,	 I	 wasn’t	 going	 to	 get	 caught.	 But	 that	 was	 before	 Saul,	 before	 BMW, before	Michelle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">DAD’S	 BRIGHTSIDE	 GIFTS	 didn’t	 stop	 with	 Billy	 Bass.	 He	 sent	 a	 fishing pole.	More	D-Cell	batteries.	He	sent	a	tuning	fork,	even	though	I’d	never	played an	 instrument.	 His	 letter	 said	 I	 should	 learn	 new	 hobbies.	 He	 wrote	 he’d	 been learning	to	kayak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">None	of	it	made	sense.	I	worried	he’d	developed	dementia.	It	explained	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">last	 few	 years,	 the	 paranoia.	 There	 were	 studies	 linking	 telepathy	 to	 brain damage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shoved	all	the	gifts	in	the	closet.	Some	I	didn’t	even	unwrap.	I	didn’t	want</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	think	about	him,	that	if	I’d	just	listened	to	his	advice,	I’d	be	in	the	real	world, not	 staring	 at	 Rachel’s	 empty	 desk	 every	 day	 or	 hiding	 from	 Krystal	 in	 the Square. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	darkness	was	closing	in.	I	didn’t	want	to	leave	my	room.	I	just	wanted</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	stay	in	bed,	stare	at	nothing,	but	I	didn’t	have	a	choice.	Isolation	got	you	sent to	 the	 Cabin	 so	 I	 looked	 for	 reasons	 to	 go	 outside	 and	 act	 like	 everything	 was fine.	I	took	walks,	hung	out	with	Danny,	bought	him	some	new	comic	books.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">reminded	me	of	Steven.	But	as	bad	as	it	was	for	Steven	and	me	as	kids,	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing	compared	to	how	Danny	had	it.	The	out	loud	taunts	hurt,	but	not	nearly</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	much	as	the	silent	ones,	the	kind	even	bullies	kept	to	themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	had	heard	them	all,	but	somehow	he	was	still	happy.	I	envied	Danny</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 tried	 to	 learn	 from	 him.	 I	 even	 stopped	 feeling	 sorry	 for	 myself	 about Rachel,	Michelle,	Krystal... </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	still	I	felt	awful	for	how	things	ended	with	Steven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	eighth	grade	we’d	stopped	hanging	out,	rarely	spoke.	I’d	been	listening</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	other	people’s	thoughts,	started	hanging	out	with	the	jocks,	the	pretty	girls.	I knew	 what	 they	 wanted	 to	 hear.	 Said	 all	 the	 right	 things	 to	 make	 them	 think	 I was	cool.	Steven	wasn’t,	never	would	be,	so	I	cut	him	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	got	sick.	Real	sick.	His	parents	pulled	him	out	of	school.	I	knew	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">should	visit,	but	I	couldn’t	face	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	 found	 out,	 heard	 me	 thinking	 one	 night	 at	 dinner	 when	 Mom	 asked</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>how	Steven	was	doing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	 drove	 me	 to	 Steven’s	 house	 to	 make	 me	 apologize.	 He	 sat	 in	 the	 car, while	 everything	 was	 yelling	 at	 me	 to	 run.	 I	 breathed	 in,	 breathed	 out,	 told myself	 I’d	 be	 okay.	 I	 didn’t	 use	 the	 doorbell	 because	 I	 didn’t	 want	 to	 wake Steven’s	parents	if	they	were	sleeping.	I’d	asked	Dad	to	just	let	me	do	this	over the	 phone,	 but	 he	 refused,	 said	 I	 needed	 to	 look	 Steven	 in	 the	 face,	 hear	 what Steven	was	really	feeling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knocked	on	the	door,	prayed	his	parents	would	tell	me	to	go	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	know	his	parents	well,	even	though	I’d	been	over	there	a	hundred</p>
<p class="calibre1">times.	They	kept	to	themselves	and	never	said	a	whole	lot,	hardly	ever	more	than hello.	 Steven	 said	 they	 didn’t	 really	 speak	 English,	 but	 I	 knew	 he	 just	 didn’t want	them	doing	it	around	me,	embarrassed	of	how	they	sounded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steven’s	mom	opened	the	door,	her	straight	black	hair	now	frosted	gray,	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes	tired	black	holes	above	pursed	lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	bowed	my	head	to	show	respect.	“Hello,	Mrs.	Chang.	Can	I	see	Hong?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Calling	 Steven	 by	 his	 real	 name	 reminded	 me	 why	 I’d	 cut	 him	 off	 in	 the first	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	 Chang	 gave	 the	 slightest	 nod	 and	 stepped	 to	 the	 side,	 revealing	 the path	of	clear	plastic	protecting	the	bright	white	carpet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 slipped	 off	 my	 shoes	 and	 set	 them	 next	 to	 the	 other	 two	 pairs.	 His	 mom was	waiting,	not	saying	a	word,	glad	I	was	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 plastic	 crinkled	 under	 my	 feet,	 the	 sweet	 smell	 of	 rice	 mixed	 with incense.	I	couldn’t	turn	back	so	I	went	down	the	hall.	Steven’s	room	was	the	last one	on	the	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 door	 was	 closed,	 nothing	 on	 it,	 his	 sign	 gone.	 HONG’S	 ROOM,	 nice and	neat	block	letters,	the	most	rebellious	thing	I	ever	convinced	him	to	do,	no way	he’d	ever	write	Steven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 opened	 his	 door.	 His	 room	 used	 to	 be	 blue.	 Now	 it	 was	 brilliant	 white, every	single	inch.	No	more	Star	Wars	posters.	No	superhero	cardboard	cut-outs</p>
<p class="calibre1">below	them.	All	of	it	was	gone,	Steven	was	done	with	childhood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	 else	 was	 just	 as	 white.	 The	 carpet,	 the	 walls,	 the	 ceiling.	 The candles	in	the	corners.	Everything	gone	except	the	giant	silk	screen	that	hung	in front	of	the	window,	the	soft	white	fabric	with	its	border	so	green,	a	blue	river and	a	big	white	bird	floating	down	the	middle	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stepped	forward.	Steven,	whiter	than	he’d	ever	been.	So	pale.	So	weak.	So</p>
<p class="calibre1">small. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steven’s	 head	 was	 propped	 three	 pillows	 high.	 All	 his	 hair	 was	 gone,	 all that	was	left	was	his	skull	and	some	skin,	his	thin	slits	for	eyes	staring	straight ahead	at	the	picture.	He	was	thinking	about	death	and	what	it	would	be	like. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>Steven	 winced	 and	 let	 out	 a	 long	 sigh	 that	 sounded	 painful	 to	 say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Unnhhhh.”	 Keeping	 his	 hand	 under	 the	 sheet,	 he	 grabbed	 hold	 of	 his	 hip.	 His bones	hurt.	All	the	time,	even	with	the	meds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stepped	 closer	 so	 my	 legs	 touched	 the	 bed.	 Seeing	 him	 like	 this	 made	 it hard	to	think.	I	didn’t	know	if	I	should	call	him	by	his	real	name.	I	cleared	my throat	so	I	wouldn’t	scare	him	and	said,	“Hey,	man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steven	 slowly	 turned	 his	 head	 and	 blinked	 twice.	 His	 thoughts	 trying	 to figure	out	how	he	felt	about	me.	If	he	hated	me	for	making	fun	of	him	at	school</p>
<p class="calibre1">because	he	still	played	Dungeons	and	Dragons	or	if	he	was	too	embarrassed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 seen	 like	 this,	 bald,	 deteriorating,	 naked	 under	 the	 sheet.	 Or	 if	 he	 was	 just glad	someone	had	finally	cared	enough	to	come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	no	idea	what	to	do.	No	one	had	ever	told	me	what	to	say	to	someone</p>
<p class="calibre1">dying.	Someone	who	had	less	than	ten	days,	two	weeks	at	the	most	according	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	teacher,	Mrs.	Kauffman.	She’d	made	us	make	this	giant	card.	We	all	signed</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	names,	some	words	of	encouragement.	I	only	wrote,	“Feel	better.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	at	the	picture	covering	the	window.	“Cool	goose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steven	spoke	so	low,	I	had	to	lean	forward.	“Swan,”	he	said.	“That’s	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hong	means.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	never	thought	his	name	actually	translated	into	anything.	“That’s	what	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">means?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	gorilla,”	Steven	said	through	a	cough.	Then	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 a	 second	 it	 was	 like	 old	 times.	 Then	 his	 smile	 twisted	 into	 a	 grimace because	 he	 realized	 that	 even	 the	 shittiest,	 loneliest,	 most	 humiliating	 times would	be	better	than	no	times	at	all.	He’d	sit	through	Corey’s	little	dance	all	day every	day	if	it	meant	getting	better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pointed	at	the	swan.	“I’ll	take	it	down.	You	want	me	to?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	 know	 best.”	 He	 paused	 to	 catch	 his	 breath.	 “They	 say	 I’m	 just	 a child.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	know	what	to	say,	so	my	lips	stayed	still.	I	thought,  <i class="calibre4">I’m	so	sorry. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Steven’s	 eyes	 grew	 wide.	 I’d	 never	 spoken	 to	 someone	 in	 thought.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	frightened,	and	I	took	off	running,	ran	all	the	way	to	the	car.	Dad	knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	I’d	done,	but	this	time	he	didn’t	lecture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	days	later,	Steven	was	gone,	taking	my	secret	to	the	grave. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a><img src="index-60_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	SEVEN</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">NIGHT	58,	LIGHTNING	flashed	on	the	other	side	of	the	mountain,	a	loud	boom</p>
<p class="calibre1">less	than	a	second	behind	it.	The	freezing	rain	fell	in	sheets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 was	 out	 walking	 and	 got	 caught	 in	 the	 storm.	 I	 took	 off	 for	 the	 Square, ended	up	at	Riley’s,	the	tiny,	dark	tavern	at	the	edge	of	town.	Cheap	vinyl	booths lined	the	walls.	The	door	to	the	storage	room	was	propped	open	with	a	brick.	A</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman	with	a	brown	braided	ponytail	was	dragging	a	keg.	The	way	she	moved</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	 she’d	 been	 doing	 this	 her	 whole	 life.	 She	 was	 covered	 in	 tattoos,	 her strangely	hypnotic	eyes	pulling	me	to	the	bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 wiped	 her	 hands	 on	 the	 back	 of	 her	 low-cut	 jeans.	 She	 was	 definitely new	to	Brightside.	Still,	there	was	something	familiar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 smiled	 and	 leaned	 over	 the	 counter,	 her	 voice	 rougher	 than	 expected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	Maybe,	I	don’t	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	that’s	no	good.	What	are	you	having?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Beer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 said	 that	 wouldn’t	 do,	 not	 in	 my	 condition.	 She	 offered	 to	 make	 me something	special.	I	shrugged.	I	hadn’t	had	a	drop	of	anything	since	Day	39,	the day	they	dragged	Rachel	from	my	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bartender	said	her	name	was	Lexi.	She	asked	mine	and	I	told	her.	Then</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 wanted	 to	 know	 my	 last	 name	 and	 said,	 “I’ve	 heard	 of	 you.”	 I	 had	 a	 hard time	believing	that	with	her	acting	so	nice.	She	told	me	to	stop	being	ridiculous and	have	a	seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pulled	out	a	stool,	sat	down,	and	reached	for	my	wallet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Put	that	away,”	she	said.	“First	one’s	on	the	house.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	probably	going	to	only	have	one,	so	I	should	just...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	told	me	to	stop	being	silly,	but	I	did	way	more	than	that,	my	thoughts</p>
<p class="calibre1">drifting	to	Steven’s	funeral. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	a	dark	one,	aren’t	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shifted	back	on	the	stool,	considered	leaving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	give	me	a	smile	and	I	promise	to	make	it	better.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lexi	was	too	pretty	not	to	smile	at.	She	walked	to	the	back	wall,	the	rows	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">bottles	three	stacks	high.	She	asked	where	I	was	from. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Outside	Columbus.”	Saying	that	made	me	feel	like	a	tourist,	like	this	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>simply	a	business	trip.	Tomorrow,	I’d	be	home	sitting	with	my	dog	curled	up	at my	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily...filled	with	bullets	on	my	carpet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	stop	that.	There’s	no	bad	thoughts	when	you	get	a	free	drink.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry.”	 I	 tried	 to	 play	 the	 part,	 returning	 the	 favor,	 asked	 where	 they nabbed	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“L.A.”	She	poured	the	Jack,	gave	it	two	quick	stirs.	A	drink	in	each	hand, </p>
<p class="calibre1">both	full	to	the	top.	We	clinked	glasses,	somehow	managed	not	to	spill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 whiskey	 was	 so	 strong	 I	 couldn’t	 taste	 the	 mixer.	 I	 said,	 “Just	 what	 I need.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lexi	 put	 her	 glass	 to	 her	 lips,	 finished	 it	 in	 one	 long	 swallow.	 She	 closed her	 eyes,	 rolled	 her	 head	 around	 her	 shoulders,	 the	 liquid	 medicine	 kicking	 in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thought	you’d	like	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“L.A.,	huh?	How	was	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	like	anywhere	else.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knocked	back	my	drink,	tried	not	to	think	about	all	the	places	I	could’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Another?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thata	boy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	haven’t	been	here	long,	have	you?	I	haven’t	seen—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Five	days.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	should	go	to	the	diner.	They	have	a	decent	turkey	sandwich.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	check	it	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	banana	split	isn’t	bad	either.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 inane	 conversation	 was	 heaven,	 especially	 with	 the	 next	 drink,	 a	 bit sweeter,	 but	 also	 tart.	 I	 asked	 about	 her	 tattoos.	 She	 told	 me	 the	 guy	 who	 did them	 was	 a	 magician.	 I	 thought	 she	 meant	 he	 was	 an	 incredible	 artist,	 but	 she said	no,	he	pulled	rabbits	out	of	a	fucking	hat.	The	tattoo	thing	was	just	a	side gig. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lexi	tossed	the	washrag	into	the	sink	and	walked	with	a	swagger	that	hadn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	there	before.	I	tried	not	to	stare	at	her	ass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	flashed	a	grin,	held	up	her	hands.	“Easy,	Tiger.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry.	But...do	I	know	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lexi’s	eyes	rolled.	Was	this	really	my	line? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	mean	it.	You	look	familiar.	You	sure	you	were	never	in	Columbus?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shook	her	head.	“Nope.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	 about	 her	 smile	 kept	 me	 going.	 I	 said,	 “We’ve	 met	 before.	 I know	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>Lexi	washed	out	 her	glass.	“You	 probably	know	my	 girlfriend.	People	get us	confused.	She’s	been	here	almost	a	year.”	Lexi	kept	talking,	but	the	clinking glasses	and	people	walking	in	made	it	hard	to	hear.	The	buzz	didn’t	help	either.	It was	strange,	tingly.	I	didn’t	feel	that	drunk,	just	loose	and	confident. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lexi	said,	“She’ll	be	here	soon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 nodded,	 having	 no	 idea	 what	 she	 was	 talking	 about.	 I	 held	 up	 my	 drink, tried	to	guess	what	it	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lexi	 headed	 to	 the	 other	 end	 of	 the	 bar	 to	 serve	 the	 new	 customers.	 “It’s good,	right?”	she	called	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	another	sip	and	said,	“Yeah.”	I	couldn’t	place	the	contents,	but	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">delicious	and	I	wanted	another	one.	Lexi	was	making	one	of	the	girl’s	a	drink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lexi	 kept	 glancing	 over	 at	 me,	 but	 not	 in	 a	 friendly	 way.	 It	 was	 like	 she	 was pissed.	But	I	hadn’t	done	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	set	the	glass	on	the	bar,	promised	myself	to	hold	off	on	another	one.	There</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	a	little	bit	of	liquid	at	the	bottom	of	my	drink.	I	finished	it	and	set	the	glass down	harder	than	I	meant	to.	Faces	of	the	people	I’d	hurt	flashing	before	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel,	Steven,	Michelle... </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 door	 opened	 and	 rain	 smacked	 off	 the	 sidewalk.	 One	 of	 the	 women</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 accounting	 stepped	 inside	 and	 shook	 the	 rain	 from	 her	 coat,	 her	 bulldog cheeks	flapping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	saw	me,	pretended	not	to,	and	took	a	seat	in	a	booth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 could	 feel	 my	 heart	 beating,	 felt	 it	 even	 in	 my	 thumbs.	 I	 needed	 to	 get home,	but	Lexi	was	no	longer	behind	the	bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	knee	was	bouncing,	made	my	foot	slip	off	the	bottom	rung	of	the	stool. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lexi	walked	out	of	the	storage	room	looking	like	it	was	normal	to	disappear</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	ten	minutes.	At	least	it	felt	like	that	long.	She	greeted	another	customer,	went to	the	tap,	never	once	looked	my	direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 considered	 heading	 over	 to	 order	 another	 drink	 when	 the	 front	 door</p>
<p class="calibre1">opened.	 Two	 guys	 from	 the	 deli	 entered,	 nodding	 hello	 when	 they	 slid	 in	 the booth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	thumbs	were	beating	a	rhythm	on	the	glass,	who	knows	for	how	long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	opened	again,	the	rain	blowing	in.	I	didn’t	check	to	see	who	it	was.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">kept	my	eyes	on	Lexi	so	I	could	motion	for	another	round.	I	was	feeling	good, </p>
<p class="calibre1">alive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lexi	 poured	 a	 glass	 of	 wine	 without	 once	 looking	 up.	 The	 front	 door</p>
<p class="calibre1">opened	and	closed,	but	Lexi	was	busy,	wiping	down	the	damn	tap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	girl	said,	“Sorry	I’m	late.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	that	voice.	I	turned	toward	the	front	door.	Krystal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	took	the	last	stool	at	the	bar,	just	out	of	my	reach.	She	smiled	at	Lexi, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a>and	Lexi	set	two	drinks	in	front	of	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal	said,	“Two?	You	trying	to	get	me	drunk?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking	 like	 she	 really	 wanted	 to	 hear	 the	 answer,	 Lexi	 said,	 “Do	 I	 need to?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal	reached	over	and	put	her	hand	on	top	of	Lexi’s.	“What	are	they?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	good.”	Lexi	pointed	at	me.	“Ask	your	friend.	He’ll	tell	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal	 turned,	 her	 glare	 carved	 right	 through	 me.	 “What	 are	 you	 doing here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pointed	at	the	roof.	“Just	trying	to	stay	dry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	bit	the	side	of	her	lip.	She	looked	at	Lexi	over	at	the	other	end	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bar	then	back	at	me.	“What’d	you	tell	her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean?	We	barely	talked.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal	 leaned	 forward	 close	 enough	 to	 see	 the	 concealer	 packed	 into	 her pockmarks.	 Krystal’s	 tongue	 pushed	 out	 her	 cheek,	 her	 huntress	 eyes	 never leaving	me.	“So?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	say	anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 suddenly	 felt	 like	 everyone	 was	 staring.	 I	 started	 to	 get	 up,	 but	 saw another	 drink	 in	 front	 of	 me.	 Lexi	 was	 walking	 away.	 She’d	 finally	 given	 me another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 picked	 up	 the	 drink	 and	 finished	 half	 of	 it,	 tried	 to	 get	 my	 thoughts together.	The	front	door	opened,	the	rain	louder	than	before.	I	must	have	looked startled	because	Krystal	leaned	over	and	said,	“That	bother	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	another	drink,	looked	over	at	Lexi	bending	over.	“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	going	to	tell	her	what	a	slut	she	is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?	No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	is	though,	just	so	you	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 took	 another	 drink,	 wondered	 why	 my	 mind	 was	 racing,	 why	 I	 couldn’t understand	what	we	were	talking	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These	drinks	are	good,	huh?”	Krystal	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	skin	felt	hot,	like	I	was	sitting	inside	an	oven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	you	didn’t	drink.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	drink.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,	two.	That’s	the	limit.”	She	pushed	out	her	bottom	lip,	mocking	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rachel	 said	 you	 love	 your	 rules.	 Only	 two	 drinks.”	 She	 wagged	 her	 finger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	no	caffeine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wrapped	both	hands	around	my	glass,	looked	at	the	ice.	“I	didn’t	realize</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	two	were	friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	not.	It’s	a	small	town.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lexi	walked	up	and	put	an	arm	around	Krystal’s	shoulder.	“So?	Do	you	like</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal	kissed	her	cheek.	“Absolutely	perfect.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lexi	squeezed	Krystal	tight	then	stepped	back.	“What	about	you,	Joe?	Want</p>
<p class="calibre1">another?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	kept	quiet	while	my	mind	yelled	at	me,	shouted	what	the	hell	was	going</p>
<p class="calibre1">on.	My	thoughts	were	jumping	everywhere.	The	jukebox,	my	first	kiss,	the	day</p>
<p class="calibre1">Steven	caught	a	frog.	I	thought	of	the	rollercoaster	rides	with	my	first	girlfriend, the	 morning	 I	 woke	 up	 in	 the	 cell	 after	 the	 Boots	 took	 me	 from	 my	 home,	 the ringing	in	my	ear... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lexi	and	Krystal	started	laughing.	Crazed,	cackling	laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lexi	turned	toward	me	and	smiled.	“They’re	good,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded,	bit	my	tongue,	which	was	moving	around	my	mouth	like	a	wild</p>
<p class="calibre1">snake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lexi	pointed	at	Krystal’s	glass.	“Another?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	way,	I	need	to	sleep	at	some	point.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	you	don’t.	I’ll	keep	you	company.”	Lexi	kissed	Krystal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	both	of	them	stared	at	me,	waiting	for	me	to	realize	they	were	behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	scheme.	I	looked	at	my	empty	glass	then	at	the	bar.	Next	to	the	wine	bottles and	the	wobbling	tower	of	glasses,	two	cans	of	Red	Bull. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 looked	 down	 at	 the	 drink,	 not	 sure	 how	 long	 I’d	 been	 back	 thumbing	 a drum	beat	on	it.	I	thought	a	stream	of	“oh	fucks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lexi	said	she	was	going	to	have	a	smoke	and	walked	off,	disappeared	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	storage	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal	 looked	 at	 me	 like	 a	 little	 kid.	 “You’ll	 be	 fine.	 Go	 get	 yourself	 a water.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Four	drinks	didn’t	seem	too	much	until	I	stood,	everything	off.	I	held	onto</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 back	 of	 the	 stool	 for	 balance.	 Every	 booth	 had	 a	 body	 in	 it.	 The	 place suddenly	packed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	made	my	way	down	the	bar,	towards	the	storage	room.	The	busboy	waved</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	rag	to	get	my	attention.	“Hey	man,	what	are	you	looking	for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Louder	than	she	needed	to,	same	as	she	always	talked,	Gloria	from	Human</p>
<p class="calibre1">Resources	said,	“Gimme	a	gin	and	tonic,	a	bottled	water.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	“Me	too,	about	the	water.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 busboy	 pulled	 two	 waters	 from	 the	 cooler.	 One	 for	 me	 and	 one	 for Gloria	who	wouldn’t	stop	thinking	about	her	two	kids	at	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	the	water,	headed	back	to	my	stool	where	Alex,	the	perfectly	dressed</p>
<p class="calibre1">schoolboy	with	his	bulging	muscles,	was	now	sitting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse	me,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alex	 kept	 talking	 to	 Krystal,	 acting	 like	 he	 didn’t	 hear	 me.	 If	 he	 didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a>move	 out	 of	 my	 way	 in	 two	 seconds	 I	 was	 going	 to	 pick	 up	 my	 almost	 empty glass	and	slam	it	into	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	thoughts	always	give	everything	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alex	 whipped	 around,	 his	 right	 hand	 smacking	 my	 forearm,	 sending	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">water	bottle	flying.	Not	about	to	apologize,	Alex	said,	“I	didn’t	know	you	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	my	seat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	need	to	get	upset,	bro.”	Alex	got	off	the	stool	and	looked	down	on	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	saying	hi.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	I	was	acting	like	an	idiot,	but	couldn’t	control	it.	“Well,	goodbye.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alex	 stood	 there,	 his	 mouth	 set	 like	 he	 had	 something	 important	 to	 say.	 I clenched	my	fist,	ready	to	take	my	best	shot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	you	find	another	seat,”	Krystal	said	to	me.	“Or	another	bar.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alex	 tried	 to	 sound	 tough,	 his	 eyes	 never	 leaving	 my	 hands.	 “You	 heard her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal	finished	the	rest	of	her	drink	and	slid	it	next	to	the	empties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 glanced	 over	 my	 shoulder.	 Everyone	 in	 the	 place	 was	 looking	 at	 me	 or pretending	 not	 to.	 Except	 Krystal.	 She	 was	 too	 busy	 looking	 at	 Alex,	 her shoulders	back,	chest	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	looking	at	me,	Krystal	said,	“Go	home,	Joe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 wasn’t	 even	 eleven.	 Twelve.	 Twenty-four.	 Forty-eight.	 I	 gave	 it	 up,	 my foot	 pumping	 up	 and	 down,	 knee	 bumping	 the	 stool	 Alex	 was	 sitting	 on.	 My fucking	stool. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	like	making	a	fool	of	yourself	in	front	of	everyone?”	Krystal	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	everybody	else	could	go	fuck	themselves.	“What	do	I	care?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	should	watch	yourself,”	Alex	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	around,	no	one	next	to	us.	Just	Alex,	Krystal,	and	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	good	to	think	like	that.	People	might	not	like	you.”	Alex	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who?	Edward,	Frances?	Sheila,	Gloria?	They’re	like	eight,	ten	feet	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 truth	 was	 there	 was	 no	 real	 way	 of	 knowing	 when	 someone	 else	 was hearing	 my	 thoughts.	 Not	 in	 Brightside,	 not	 unless	 they	 started	 thinking	 about the	same	exact	shit	or	said	something	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thunder	 crashed	 down	 the	 street,	 rattled	 the	 whole	 building.	 Krystal	 liked it,	enjoyed	the	driving	rain	on	the	roof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	brain	was	on	hyperdrive,	thoughts	racing	around	the	slippery	track.	My</p>
<p class="calibre1">problems,	my	options,	the	possible	solutions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal	was	past	irritated.	“Just	leave.	We’re	obviously	not	good	enough	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">you.	You’re	 <i class="calibre4">sooo</i>	much	better	than	everyone,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said	no,	but	couldn’t	stop	the	names	flashing.	Krystal’s	list. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>Krystal	 grabbed	 one	 of	 the	 glasses	 and	 threw	 the	 ice	 at	 me.	 “Fuck	 you, Joe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	a	napkin,	wiped	my	face.	I	told	her,	“Don’t	be	mad.	You’re	a	doll.”	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">nodded	 at	 the	 purse	 some	 guy	 bought.	 “You	 even	 come	 with	 all	 the	 right accessories.”	 I	 thought	 of	 everyone	 I	 knew	 she’d	 been	 with,	 the	 hundreds	 of faceless	figures	from	her	past.	“Packaged	for	mass	consumption.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alex	couldn’t	believe	all	the	men	I	was	thinking	about,	all	the	horrible	acts</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	depravity	on	Krystal’s	body.	It	was	turning	him	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	all	just	whores,	right,	Joe?	Like	Rachel?”	Krystal	looked	at	me	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">disgust.	“You	put	her	there.	Just	admit	it.	You	made	her	feel	like	a	piece	of	shit and	she	broke.	You	broke	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	forgot	everything,	but	the	dirty	no	good	stupid	bitch	in	front	of	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal	licked	her	lips,	tasted	victory.	Knowing	exactly	how	much	it	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">hurt,	knowing	it	was	something	I	couldn’t	hear,	she	said,	“Rachel	loved	you,	but that	 wasn’t	 enough.	 You	 had	 to	 grind	 her	 down	 into	 nothing.	 You’re	 just	 a pathetic	coward.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 started	 walking	 towards	 the	 door,	 held	 up	 my	 middle	 finger	 because</p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal	was	too	far	away	to	know	how	much	I	hated	her	right	then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	yelled,	“Why	don’t	you	tell	everybody	what	you	think	of	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendell	 was	 squeezed	 into	 the	 booth	 to	 my	 right,	 minding	 his	 own</p>
<p class="calibre1">business,	thinking	he	didn’t	want	to	hear	it.	Stephanie	slipped	off	her	stool	and hurried	away,	bumping	my	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	ahead,	tell	them!”	Krystal	screamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	needed	to	head	for	the	door.	My	mind	no	longer	my	own.	Each	face	firing</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	judgments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 and	 his	 ridiculous	 Mohawk,	 a	 kid	 who	 needed	 his	 ass	 kicked.	 He slunk	into	his	seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal	said,	“See,	Tommy.	I’m	not	lying.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tommy	 felt	 everyone	 looking	 at	 him.	 He	 got	 up	 from	 the	 bar	 and	 looked right	at	me,	forced	himself	to	sound	strong,	even	with	his	cracking	voice.	“You</p>
<p class="calibre1">planning	on	doing	it	or	hoping	someone	else	will?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think...I	mean	that’s	not	really—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or	what	about	Erica?”	Krystal	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Erica,	with	those	sad	eyes,	so	tired	because	she	couldn’t	stop	playing	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself	at	night,	wishing	she	had	more	fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Erica’s	 face	 turned	 red.	 Her	 hands	 slipped	 under	 the	 table,	 not	 wanting anyone	to	look	at	them.	She	wouldn’t	look	at	me,	just	thought	about	me	getting</p>
<p class="calibre1">sent	to	the	Cabin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	close	enough,	Wendell,”	Krystal	said.	“Does	Joe	think	you	should</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>either	stop	feeling	sorry	for	yourself	or	cut	out	the	donut	holes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	no	over	and	over	and	over	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone’s	 thoughts	 slamming	 into	 me,	 just	 like	 kindergarten.	 Everyone</p>
<p class="calibre1">hating	me,	wishing	I’d	just	die. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 saw	 the	 door,	 took	 off	 running.	 Got	 out	 before	 I	 hurt	 someone	 else.	 The rain	 pummeled	 me	 as	 I	 stepped	 onto	 the	 Square.	 I	 headed	 for	 Main	 Street, splashing	across	the	sidewalk.	My	life	was	over,	a	sorry	joke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 looked	 back	 across	 the	 street	 sure	 I’d	 see	 everyone	 pointing,	 laughing their	ass	off,	but	I	was	alone.	Here	in	this	mountain	town	filled	with	people	just like	me,	I	was	the	goddamn	freak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	strong	wind	nearly	knocked	me	over	when	I	turned	the	corner	and	left	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Square	behind.	Down	the	street	and	over	the	park,	the	clouds	were	beginning	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">break.	The	giant	moon	hung	in	front	of	me,	casting	a	dull	white	light,	a	spotlight on	the	world’s	biggest	asshole. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	one	who	judged	everyone:	Krystal,	Erica,	Wendell,	Rachel,	Mom,	Dad, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	even	poor	Steven,	my	first	real	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 kept	 walking,	 tried	 to	 stay	 away	 from	 the	 spotlight.	 I	 could	 see	 the cemetery,	the	place	I’d	never	been	because	I	knew	I’d	see	it	soon	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	my	own	fault	for	drinking,	for	being	in	the	bar	in	the	first	place.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">sidewalk	was	one	answer.	I	could	bash	my	head	into	it	until	the	voices	stopped, </p>
<p class="calibre1">my	skull	cracking	on	the	concrete. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 slapped	 myself	 harder	 than	 I’d	 ever	 done	 before	 and	 started	 for	 my apartment.	That’s	what	everyone	wanted.	Sight	unseen	so	I	couldn’t	hurt	anyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 entered	 the	 park	 and	 kept	 to	 the	 path.	 I	 heard	 Dad	 yelling	 at	 me	 to	 stop acting	like	a	child.	All	I	had	to	do	was	rationalize	what	I	was	feeling.	It	was	my brain,	I	could	think	about	what	I	wanted,	feel	whatever	I	told	myself	to.	I	would control	my	emotions,	not	the	other	way	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 I	 crossed	 by	 the	 pond,	 I	 saw	 the	 Cabin	 on	 the	 hill.	 I	 thought	 of checking	 myself	 in,	 taking	 a	 seat,	 swallowing	 whatever	 they	 gave	 me.	 At	 least I’d	be	with	Rachel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel... </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’d	been	two	weeks	since	they’d	taken	her	from	my	room.	Just	like	Steven, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	avoided	her,	but	it	was	time	I	looked	her	in	the	eyes,	to	apologize. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Cabin	never	closed.	I	went	inside,	found	Rachel	just	sitting	in	the	front</p>
<p class="calibre1">room.	Her	mouth	so	dry,	there	wasn’t	any	drool.	I	asked	if	I	could	give	her	some water.	The	nurse	handed	me	a	cup	and	I	tried	to	pour	it	in,	but	it	just	spilled	out of	her	lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Drink. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel’s	 eyes	 gained	 a	 little	 focus,	 then	 closed.	 Her	 throat	 began	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>swallow. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I’m	so	sorry, </i> I	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel’s	eyes	turned	towards	me,	but	there	was	nothing	inside	her	head.	So</p>
<p class="calibre1">quiet	it	made	me	want	to	scream.	She	turned	towards	the	window,	the	big	moon</p>
<p class="calibre1">hidden	behind	the	clouds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	understand	if	you	hate	me.	You	actually	have	some	company.”	I	forced	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">laugh,	hoping	she’d	join	in,	that	it’d	be	like	old	times,	but	she	just	kept	staring out	the	window.	Silent,	broken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	nurse	came	over	and	said,	“It’s	time	for	her	bath.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	orderly	lifted	Rachel	to	her	feet	and	she	took	the	tiniest	steps	down	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hall.	The	nurse	said	I	could	wait,	spend	more	time	with	her	after	the	bath,	but	I’d seen	enough,	which	is	what	they	wanted.	That’s	why	they	allowed	visitors.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted	 everyone	 in	 Brightside	 to	 know	 what	 would	 happen	 if	 we	 broke	 the rules. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back	 at	 my	 apartment	 I	 found	 another	 package.	 My	 father	 had	 sent	 me	 a picture	 of	 us	 fishing.	 He’d	 put	 it	 in	 this	 strange	 homemade	 frame	 cobbled together	with	pieces	of	metal.	I	put	it	in	the	closet	with	the	rest	of	his	gifts.	There was	hardly	any	room	with	all	the	boxes.	I	thought	about	taking	most	of	it	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	garbage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fishing	pole	clanged	to	the	floor.	I	picked	it	up.	The	rod	was	jet	black, </p>
<p class="calibre1">heavier	than	I’d	ever	felt	before,	like	it	was	meant	to	catch	some	huge	monster	of the	sea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 started	 to	 place	 it	 back	 in	 the	 closet,	 but	 remembered	 my	 father’s	 words after	Steven	died. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	 someone	 dies,	 you	 have	 to	 remember	 there’s	 still	 so	 many	 people that	need	your	love.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 remembered	 I	 did	 have	 one	 friend	 in	 Brightside.	 Even	 if	 everyone	 else hated	me,	wanted	to	see	me	thrown	off	the	edge,	I	still	had	Danny. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a><img src="index-69_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	EIGHT</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">ON	DAY	61,	THE	SUN	was	out	and	it	was	kind	of	warm,	so	I	asked	Danny	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’d	 like	 to	 go	 fishing.	 He	 started	 jumping	 up	 and	 down,	 clapping	 his	 hand against	 the	 fist	 that	 held	 the	 faded	 blue	 pencil.	 I	 took	 that	 as	 a	 yes.	 We	 cut	 a small	hole	in	the	ice.	The	pond	didn’t	have	any	fish,	but	I	kept	it	to	myself.	We just	sat	quietly	on	the	bank,	Danny’s	mind	as	calm	as	Michelle’s	on	the	pills	and whiskey.	I	guess	that’s	the	other	reason	why	I	liked	hanging	out	with	Danny.	The silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	two	days	later	Danny	became	the	loudest	thing	in	Brightside.	He	ran	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	me	on	the	street,	nearly	knocked	me	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	need	a	drawing!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hated	to	spoil	his	fun,	but	he	couldn’t	hold	still.	“Okay,	Danny.	Just	calm</p>
<p class="calibre1">down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	need	it	now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	to	go	to	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please,	you	gotta!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	going	on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	sister...	She’s	coming!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	day,	Rachel’s	desk	was	no	longer	empty.	Danny’s	sister,	Sara,	sat</p>
<p class="calibre1">there,	 everything	 neat	 and	 organized.	 Nothing	 personal	 to	 distinguish	 her workspace	 from	 anyone	 else’s,	 except	 for	 one	 of	 my	 drawings	 Danny	 had wanted	her	to	have. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	 had	 been	 the	 opposite,	 papers	 scattered,	 pens	 everywhere,	 pictures of	her	father,	mother,	dog,	and	cat	spread	along	the	edge,	a	proud	collage	of	her past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 stupid	 to	 date	 Rachel.	 First	 time	 I	 saw	 where	 I	 was	 going	 to	 be sitting,	 I	 should’ve	 told	 Carlos	 I	 needed	 a	 new	 desk.	 I	 should’ve	 said	 I	 needed somewhere	I	could	be	by	myself.	Somewhere	I	couldn’t	hurt	anyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 whole	 life’s	 been	 one	 big	 should’ve.	 Should’ve	 known	 better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Should’ve	listened.	Should’ve	paid	attention.	Should’ve	stopped	worrying	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">everyone.	Should’ve	realized	I’m	only	as	dumb	as	I	let	myself	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	 dialed	 another	 number,	 some	 lady	 in	 Kentucky	 about	 an	 island</p>
<p class="calibre1">getaway.	She	followed	the	script,	but	made	it	her	own,	telling	each	person	how</p>
<p class="calibre1">she’d	 always	 dreamed	 of	 living	 by	 the	 ocean.	 It	 sounded	 believable,	 but	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>thoughts	told	me	she	didn’t	want	to	be	anywhere	but	Brightside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	creepy.	I	mean,	there	were	some	who	believed	Brightside	wasn’t	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">bad.	People	like	Sharon	and	her	puppet,	Vanessa,	women	so	positive	it	made	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">sick.	But	Sara	was	the	first	I’d	heard	of	that	really	wanted	to	be	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’d	 turned	 herself	 in	 on	 purpose,	 demanded	 to	 be	 reunited	 with	 Danny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	kept	her	in	a	cell	for	a	month.	No	one	turned	themself	in.	She	must	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 a	 plan,	 a	 scheme.	 They	 interrogated	 her,	 deprived	 her	 of	 sleep,	 but	 Sara never	cracked,	just	kept	whispering	her	brother’s	name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	picture	I’d	drawn	for	Danny,	the	one	with	the	boy	escaping	through	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">brick	 wall,	 sat	 on	 her	 desk.	 For	 me,	 the	 picture	 was	 about	 escaping	 Brightside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	Sara,	it	was	about	breaking	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	 was	 twenty	 when	 their	 parents	 had	 died,	 Danny	 away	 at	 a	 special needs	 school.	 She	 took	 him	 in,	 cared	 for	 him,	 made	 sure	 he	 wore	 clean	 shirts, combed	his	hair,	fell	asleep	in	bed,	not	in	the	chair	watching	cartoons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 morning,	 Sara	 and	 I	 hadn’t	 shared	 a	 single	 word.	 She	 was	 already working	 the	 phones	 when	 I’d	 come	 in.	 She	 wanted	 to	 make	 a	 good	 first impression.	After	what	she’d	been	through	to	get	here,	I	didn’t	blame	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	on	our	break,	Sara	caught	me	staring	at	the	drawing.	She	tucked	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">long	strand	of	brown	hair	behind	her	ear.	Her	nose	had	this	cute	little	bump,	like she’d	broken	it	as	a	kid.	She	pointed	at	the	drawing	and	said,	“It’s	really	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I	just...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	Sara.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	Danny	told	me	you	were	coming.	Showed	me	a	picture.	I’ve	never</p>
<p class="calibre1">seen	him	so	excited.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah...	Look,	I	wanted	to	thank	you.	You	know,	for	taking	care	of	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	a	big	deal.	I	didn’t	do	anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Yes,	you	did. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	suddenly	felt	uncomfortable.	People’s	thoughts	about	me	were	rarely	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">nice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	said,	“Danny	wants	to	go	to	the	diner	tonight.	He’d	like	you	to	come	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re	not	busy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	and	I	 each	had	sandwiches.	 Danny	ordered	pancakes	 with	a	 whipped</p>
<p class="calibre1">cream	smile.	He	got	some	on	his	face	and	Sara	wiped	it	off	while	Danny	talked</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	us	fishing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	need	to	get	those	worms	out	of	our	apartment,”	Sara	said.	“It’s	gross.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny’s	special	hat	shook	back	and	forth.	“But	we	need	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	thoughts	slipped	out,	how	there	weren’t	any	fish	in	the	pond. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	dropped	his	fork. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>“I’m	sorry,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	picked	up	the	fork	and	started	thumbing	it	“You	lied?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Danny,	cut	it	out,”	Sara	said.	“He	was	being	nice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	lowered	his	head	so	all	I	could	see	was	DANNY	in	bright	red	letters.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	pissed	when	he	said,	“But	you	lied!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 know,	 but	 I	 still	 like	 going	 with	 you.”	 I	 thought	 about	 my	 apartment, about	Dad’s	first	gift. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	raised	his	head,	his	eyes	big	and	shiny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 we	 paid	 the	 tab,	 we	 went	 back	 to	 my	 place	 and	 I	 dug	 around	 in	 the closet.	 Danny	 was	 hopping	 around	 and	 Sara	 told	 him	 to	 stop	 it,	 that	 he	 was shaking	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	 probably	 already	 heard	 my	 thoughts,	 but	 I	 still	 said,	 “Alright,	 close your	eyes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	 squeezed	 his	 lids	 so	 tight	 I	 thought	 he	 might	 squish	 his	 eyeballs.	 I put	Billy	Bass	into	his	open	palms.	Danny	smiled.	I	pushed	the	button	and	it	still had	 a	 little	 juice.	 Billy	 turned	 his	 head	 and	 sang.	 Danny’s	 laughter	 filled	 the room	until	the	batteries	died. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hold	on,	there	are	extras.”	I	pulled	out	the	D-Cells	from	the	closet.	Only</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	didn’t	fit.	It	was	strange. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	 said,	 “It’s	 okay.”	 He	 opened	 his	 backpack,	 pulled	 out	 two	 C</p>
<p class="calibre1">batteries.	They	popped	right	in	and	Billy	came	back	to	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	couldn’t	believe	my	father	had	given	me	the	wrong	size.	It	said	C	right	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 box.	 I	 set	 the	 unusable	 batteries	 on	 the	 counter.	 They	 felt	 strange,	 a	 little light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	 was	 annoyed	 she	 was	 going	 to	 have	 to	 hear	 this	 damn	 song	 every night.	“Okay,	I	think	that’s	enough,	Danny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	started	hopping	again,	but	this	time	it	wasn’t	out	of	joy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	told	him	to	put	down	the	fish	and	hurry	to	the	bathroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	 had	 to	 hit	 the	 button	 one	 last	 time	 before	 handing	 it	 to	 Sara	 and scurrying	out	of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	was	looking	at	Billy	Bass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	“Sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	said	it	was	okay	and	cracked	a	smile.	“He	loves	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 stood	 there	 awkwardly,	 neither	 of	 us	 really	 knowing	 what	 to	 say.	 She was	 tired,	 thinking	 of	 her	 bed.	 I	 saw	 how	 beautiful	 she	 looked,	 even	 that	 little bump	in	her	nose.	She	turned,	embarrassed.	I	was	picturing	her	lips	on	mine,	and she	 didn’t	 feel	 the	 same	 way.	 I	 was	 destroying	 her	 opinion	 of	 me,	 and	 for	 the first	 time	 realized	 how	 hard	 it	 was	 for	 women	 in	 Brightside,	 having	 to	 hear	 all the	nasty	thoughts	men	carried. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a><img src="index-72_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	came	bounding	back	in,	breaking	the	tension. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	you	should	get	a	dog,	Joe!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tried	saying	I	wasn’t	a	pet	person.	Lily’s	breath	on	my	feet,	the	puff	on	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">arm.	Fucking	cowards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	 felt	 awful	 for	 hearing	 my	 thoughts.	 “We	 should	 probably	 go.	 It’s getting	late.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah...I’ll	see	you	both	tomorrow,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	collected	his	things,	and	they	walked	out,	leaving	me	alone	with	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughts	of	my	dog	and	those	fuckers	firing	into	her	whimpering	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 WAS	 TEN	 YEARS	 OLD	 in	 Mom’s	 new	 car	 holding	 my	 yellow	 Lab.	 Sunny</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t	 a	 puppy	 anymore,	 but	 just	 barely.	 I’d	 had	 her	 for	 six	 months	 and	 she wouldn’t	leave	my	side.	For	the	last	week,	I	hadn’t	left	hers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	one	hand	holding	her	tiny	head	to	keep	it	from	quivering.	The	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">picked	all	the	yellow	hairs	off	the	leather.	No	need	to	give	Mom	another	reason</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 freak	 out.	 She’d	 found	 Sunny	 throwing	 up	 in	 her	 room,	 fur	 falling	 off	 in clumps.	Dad	had	carried	her	to	the	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 was	 in	 the	 back	 seat,	 leaning	 into	 the	 corner	 furthest	 from	 Mom.	 The safest	spot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	pulled	over	to	the	curb.	“Okay,	you	two	get	out.	Go	do	whatever	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	 was	 in	 the	 seat	 right	 front	 of	 me,	 his	 head	 three	 feet	 away.	 When	 he said	Mom’s	name,	he	stretched	it	out,	let	her	know	it	wasn’t	right	for	her	to	talk like	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	 pulled	 down	 the	 sun	 visor,	 checked	 her	 fire	 red	 hair	 in	 the	 lighted mirror,	poofed	up	the	sides.	“What?	I	didn’t	say	anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	hadn’t.	But	she	was	thinking	she	hoped	they’d	put	Sunny	to	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	 opened	 the	 passenger	 door,	 put	 one	 foot	 on	 the	 sidewalk.	 “Are	 you going	to	park?	We	might	be	a	while.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	I’ll	be	here,”	Mom	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	got	out	and	opened	the	back	door,	helped	with	Sunny.	She	was	shaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">real	bad	in	Dad’s	hands	so	he	gave	her	back	to	me	once	I	got	on	the	sidewalk.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">held	 her	 against	 my	 belly	 and	 cradled	 her	 with	 both	 arms.	 She	 looked	 up	 with eyes	that’d	lost	all	their	shine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sliding	doors	opened	and	a	blast	of	cold	air	blew	down	from	the	vent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sunny	shuddered	real	hard,	needed	to	be	held	tighter,	have	a	hand	on	her	bony</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	to	keep	her	warm. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>There	were	two	people	at	the	counter	and	nearly	every	seat	in	the	waiting room	had	someone	in	it.	A	dog	or	cat	by	their	feet.	Most	of	the	animals	didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">look	sick.	Not	like	Sunny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	got	in	line,	looked	down	and	saw	me	shaking.	“Why	don’t	you	have	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">seat,	Joe?	There’s	one	right	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sunny	liked	it	better	sitting	down.	I	gave	her	a	quick	peck	on	her	head	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	 one	 was	 looking.	 She	 didn’t	 react,	 just	 closed	 her	 eyes.	 I	 put	 my	 finger	 in front	 of	 her	 nose	 and	 couldn’t	 feel	 a	 thing.	 Finally	 a	 small	 puff.	 Then,	 keeping her	eyes	closed,	Sunny	stuck	out	her	tongue,	licked	me	once	to	say	she	was	still there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl	with	braces	smiled	at	Dad.	“I’ll	let	the	doctor	know.	Go	ahead	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	a	seat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	Dad	even	got	to	me,	Dr.	Gentry	stuck	his	fat	face	out	of	the	back	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">waved	us	over.	“Hank,	I’ve	been	waiting	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you	for	getting	us	in,”	Dad	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	 stared	 at	 us	 walking	 past	 the	 receptionist’s	 desk.	 They’d	 been waiting	all	morning,	and	now	they	were	pissed.	None	of	them	knew	Dr.	Gentry</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	Dad	shared	a	secret. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Gentry	showed	us	into	his	office	that	was	half	the	size	of	a	real	doctor’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	sat	behind	his	desk,	his	fat	finger	pushing	up	the	eyeglasses	that	didn’t	hide his	beady	pig	eyes.	Then	he	took	Sunny	to	the	examination	room	and	ran	tests. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I	need	you	to	keep	your	mind	calm, </i>	Dad	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Dr.	Gentry	is	like	us. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 eyes	 must	 have	 looked	 like	 they	 were	 going	 to	 pop	 out	 of	 my	 head, because	Dad	told	me	to	get	a	hold	of	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you	said	we	should	never	seek—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	what	I	said.	But	we	can’t	afford	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom’s	new	car	had	pretty	much	cleaned	us	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thirty	minutes	later,	Dr.	Gentry	came	back	with	Sunny	and	sat	at	his	desk.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 standing	 in	 the	 doorway	 because	 even	 right	 there	 I	 could	 hear	 that	 creepy bastard’s	thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	think	I	could	get	closer;	then	Dad	lowered	his	voice	and	said,	“Sit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Gentry	waited	until	I	was	sitting	next	to	Dad	before	he	said,	“Sunny’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	doing	so	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	didn’t	need	test	results	to	figure	that	out.	She	could	barely	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	matter	of	fact,	Dr.	Gentry	said,	“If	she	doesn’t	have	help,	she’ll	die.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	again	and	again	and	again.	It	was	the	only	way	for	me	to	not	cry, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>to	not	yell	shut	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gentry	 twisted	 an	 old	 ruby	 ring	 he	 wore	 on	 the	 finger	 next	 to	 his	 shiny wedding	one.	“The	treatment	and	operation	she	needs	costs	a	lot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">You	owe	me, </i>	Dad	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	 Gentry	 kept	 twisting	 that	 ruby	 ring,	 never	 the	 wedding	 band.	 “Your dad’s	a	good	man.”	He	looked	right	at	Dad.  <i class="calibre4">	But	what	I	owe	you	is	far	less	than</i> <i class="calibre4">this. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sunny	shuddered,	almost	made	me	start	crying.	Dad	reached	over	and	put</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 hand	 on	 Sunny’s	 head.	 He	 told	 me	 everything	 would	 be	 alright	 then	 kept thinking	that,	like	maybe	if	he	thought	it	enough	times	it	would	make	it	true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	work	here	after	school,”	I	blurted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Gentry’s	face	twisted	a	smile.	“He’s	got	it	too?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad’s	thoughts	told	me	to	shut	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gentry	snapped	his	fingers	and	pointed	at	his	big	puffy	face.	“Up	here,”	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	to	me.	“I	want	you	to	listen	because	this	means	you	won’t	be	able	to	play</p>
<p class="calibre1">football	or	basketball	after	school.	You	won’t	be	able	to	be	on	any	teams.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 was	 fine.	 Sports	 were	 no	 big	 deal.	 It	 just	 meant	 there’d	 be	 less coaches,	refs,	and	fathers	for	Mom	to	meet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	 kept	 patting	 Sunny’s	 head,	 his	 wedding	 ring	 dull	 as	 ever.	 “Joe,	 you don’t	have—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	want	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Gentry	cleared	his	throat,	this	awful	hacking.	“So	let’s	say	I’ll	take	care</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	your	dog	as	best	I	can	and	in	exchange	you	work	every	day	after	school,	plus</p>
<p class="calibre1">Saturdays.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said	okay,	but	Dr.	Gentry	held	up	his	pointer	finger	and	took	a	drink	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	cup. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sunny’s	heartbeat	was	weak,	one	every	other	second.	This	was	just	wasting</p>
<p class="calibre1">time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gentry	 wiped	 his	 mouth	 with	 the	 back	 of	 his	 hand	 and	 said,	 “For	 two months.”	He	dragged	out	the	next	word.	“And...whatever	your	dad	has	on	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	help	cover	costs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	swallowed	hard,	but	Dr.	Gentry	didn’t	see	because	his	eyes	were	glued</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	Dad’s	hands	pulling	out	his	wallet,	digging	out	all	the	bills	inside.	The	hands that	would	hand	over	everything	he	had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	 said,	 “Hold	 on	 a	 sec.”	 Dad	 held	 out	 the	 bills,	 to	 me	 not	 Gentry.	 “It’s your	choice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	would	have	been	nice	to	yell,	“Put	the	money	back.	We	don’t	need	this	fat</p>
<p class="calibre1">bastard	 and	 his	 goddamn	 rings.”	 But	 Dr.	 Gentry	 was	 needed.	 Sunny’s	 chest barely	rose	with	each	shallow	breath.	“Give	it	to	him,”	I	said.	“Please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a><img src="index-75_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	pushed	the	bills	over.	“This	was	for	the	art	class	you	wanted.	I’d	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">saving	up	for	your	birthday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	lot	of	money.	Too	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take	it,	Joe.	I’ll	tell	your	mom	I	lost	my	wallet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Gentry	held	out	his	hand	and	pretended	to	look	sad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gave	it	to	him	and	said,	“The	class	is	stupid	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	polite	to	lie,”	Dr.	Gentry	said.	He	stuffed	the	money	in	his	pocket</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	reached	for	Sunny	with	those	fat	fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 gave	 Sunny	 one	 last	 squeeze,	 a	 kiss	 on	 her	 head	 before	 she	 went	 in	 his hands,	those	fingers	I	hoped	were	full	of	miracles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gentry	headed	for	the	door.	“Let	me	get	this	guy	taken	care	of	and	I’ll	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	three	o’clock	Monday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	real	doctor	would	know	Sunny	wasn’t	a	guy,	but	nothing	was	said	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	out,	all	five	operating	tables	right	there,	so	hard	not	to	look	at.	It	was	easier to	 stare	 straight	 ahead,	 follow	 Dad	 past	 the	 receptionist’s	 counter,	 through	 the front	door.	Sunny	was	going	to	be	okay	and	that’s	all	that	mattered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	 stepped	 to	 the	 edge	 of	 the	 sidewalk,	 looked	 up	 and	 down	 the	 street, Mom’s	car	nowhere	in	sight.	He	came	back	and	knelt	close.	“I’m	proud	of	you, </p>
<p class="calibre1">dealing	with	this	so	well.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad’s	thoughts	let	out	his	little	secret.	Dr.	Gentry	had	slept	with	Mom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded,	but	couldn’t	speak.	I	pictured	Dr.	Gentry	kissing	Mom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad’s	face	got	hard,	the	way	it	did	when	he	had	something	serious	to	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	 think	 about	 that.”	 He	 took	 my	 hand.	 “Look,	 sometimes	 the	 things	 we love	 will	 die.	 Sometimes	 they	 won’t.	 But	 it’s	 always	 important	 to	 fight.	 Life’s worth	 fighting	 for.	 Don’t	 give	 up.	 Sunny’s	 not	 going	 to.	 You’ve	 given	 her	 a chance.	I’m	proud	of	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said	thanks,	but	still	couldn’t	look	him	in	the	eyes.	“And	for	the	money.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	got	up	and	brushed	off	his	knee.	“I’m	sorry	about	the	class.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	in	the	parking	lot.	“Think	Mom	will	be	back?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably,	but	what	do	you	say	we	start	walking?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said	fine,	but	with	an	attitude. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	you	don’t	like	him,”	Dad	said.	“I	don’t	either.	But	Sunny’s	in	good</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	had	a	point	but	it	didn’t	make	anything	any	better.	It	didn’t	make	it	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">easier	to	follow	him,	not	sure	how	he	could	hold	his	shoulders	back,	head	high</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	if	there	was	nothing	to	be	embarrassed	about,	like	there	wasn’t	a	care	in	the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>DAY	65,	I	WAS	AT	WORK	talking	to	a	guy	in	New	Mexico	about	a	condo	in Vail,	I	told	him	he	could	ski	right	to	his	front	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	I	don’t	know,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	just	have	to	picture	it.	Fresh	powder.	A	warm	fire.”	I	was	drawing	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">picture	of	Sunny,	only	had	the	eyes,	those	sad	eyes	as	we	left	her	there	with	Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gentry.	“And	you’ll	never	beat	the	price.	You	even	qualify	for—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	call	you	back.	I	have	to	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	well,	let	me	just	give	the	best	number	to	reach—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	already	hung	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	set	down	my	pencil,	stared	at	Sunny’s	eyes	that	took	up	half	the	page.	No</p>
<p class="calibre1">mouth.	No	nose.	No	face.	Just	those	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 irises	 were	 so	 brown	 I	 colored	 them	 black,	 red	 squiggles	 stretched across	all	the	white.	The	eyes	were	terrified,	the	eyebrows	angled	up	because	she just	wanted	me	to	stay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	said,	“Can	I	see?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	banged	my	knee	on	the	desk,	had	no	idea	Sara	was	at	hers.	“When’d	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	in?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	took	off	her	black	peacoat	and	put	it	on	the	back	of	her	chair.	“Just	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">few	minutes	ago.	I	said	hi.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	 had	 on	 a	 silver	 turtleneck.	 Sleeveless.	 I’d	 never	 seen	 her	 arms.	 The scars	crisscrossing	her	flesh.	Permanent	reminders	of	how	she	used	to	deal	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	gift. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded	at	my	notepad.	“Anything	good?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	flipped	to	a	fresh	page	and	said,	“No,	just	scribbles.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	put	on	her	headset	and	turned	to	her	screen.	“How	are	the	calls?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	no	point	in	lying,	but	that	didn’t	stop	me.	“Good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’ll	turn	around.	You	just	have	to	stick	with	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	and	her	optimism.	It’s	what	got	her	here,	that	belief	that	things	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	better,	she’d	eventually	be	reunited	with	her	brother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I,	uh,	had	a	good	time	with	you	and	Danny,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	was	on	another	call.	I	looked	down	at	the	desk,	wondering	why	I	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	be	such	a	creep,	picturing	her	lips	on	mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	spun	in	her	chair,	mouthed,	“Me	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 made	 me	 smile.	 Sara	 spun	 back,	 telling	 a	 woman	 how	 there	 were	 only three	units	left.	I	started	to	pick	up	the	phone,	but	one	more	hang	up,	one	more stop	calling,	and	I	was	going	to	lose	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carlos’s	 door	 was	 closed.	 I	 picked	 up	 the	 pencil,	 not	 sure	 what	 I’d	 draw. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	I	could	share,	not	be	ashamed	of,	like	Sunny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	hand	got	moving,	etched	the	outline	of	Sara’s	desk.	She	was	looking	at</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a>her	screen,	a	perfect	model	with	her	hair	pulled	back,	her	gentle	face	no	longer hidden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	did	her	hair	quick,	a	bundled	brown	ponytail.	Her	eye	was	six	o’clock	sky</p>
<p class="calibre1">blue,	 her	 nose	 with	 that	 small	 bump.	 I	 shaded	 her	 lips	 the	 lightest	 red,	 even though	I’d	never	seen	her	with	anything	on	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	soft	lines	for	her	chin,	the	side	of	the	pencil	to	color	the	turtleneck.	Her shoulders	and	arms	were	next.	I	hesitated,	not	sure	what	to	do.	Her	scars	were	a dull	pink	under	the	fluorescent,	none	looking	newer	than	a	decade.	I	thought	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaving	 them	 off	 because	 that	 part	 of	 her	 life	 was	 behind	 her.	 But	 that	 seemed dishonest,	 fake,	 too	 much	 like	 a	 half-truth.	 It’d	 be	 like	 drawing	 Mom	 holding Dad’s	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 carefully	 nicked	 a	 few	 lines	 on	 Sara’s	 arm,	 made	 it	 so	 they	 were	 barely there.	The	picture	wasn’t	complete	so	I	filled	in	some	shadows,	added	the	tinge</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	red	to	her	cheeks.	I	had	to	make	her	smile	a	bit	bigger	too,	like	the	moment</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	saw	Danny	after	processing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	my	time	tearing	it	out	of	the	pad,	folding	it	in	half.	I	felt	like	a	first grader	on	Valentine’s	when	I	got	up	and	handed	it	to	her.	“Sorry	about...sorry.”	I quickly	walked	back	to	my	desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	tried	to	keep	the	woman	on	the	line,	but	lost	her.	She	took	the	paper, </p>
<p class="calibre1">opened	it	up,	and	didn’t	say	a	word.	She	couldn’t	pretend	it	wasn’t	her	with	all the	tiny	scars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	 sounded	 so	 young	 when	 she	 said,	 “I	 can	 put	 on	 my	 coat	 if	 it	 bothers you	too	much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	God	no.	No.	Please.	I’m	sorry.	You	look	great.	I	was	just...I	didn’t...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 leaned	 back	 in	 her	 chair,	 but	 we	 were	 still	 in	 range,	 no	 reason	 to	 lie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some	people	prefer	I	cover	up.	I	don’t	blame	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sara,	 they’re	 idiots.	 If	 they	 don’t	 like	 the	 way	 you	 look,	 they’re	 blind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’re	beautiful.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	kept	looking	at	her	arms.	“Oh	yes,	gorgeous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	scars	just	show	you	survived.”	I	took	my	time	looking	at	her,	letting</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	know	everything	I	said	was	true.	“They	show	you’ve	been	through	some	bad</p>
<p class="calibre1">shit.”	That	wasn’t	what	I	meant	to	say.	I	wanted	to	make	her	feel	good,	to	let	her know	I	loved	that	she	was	showing	them	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 must	 have	 heard	 me	 because	 Sara’s	 cheeks	 got	 a	 bit	 more	 colorful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	mean	it.	I’m	just	telling	you...	I	don’t	know.	It’s	just	a	drawing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	I	like	it.”	Sara	taped	it	to	the	wall	where	we	could	both	see	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	have	to	put	it	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	smiled	and	swiveled	toward	me.	“It’s	mine,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a><img src="index-78_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said	it	was,	heard	Sara	thinking	maybe	I	was	a	nice	guy.	Then	she	hoped	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t	going	to	start	thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	too	late,	my	pad	turned	back	to	Sunny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five	 days	 of	 injections	 hadn’t	 made	 a	 difference	 so	 Dr.	 Gentry	 started	 her on	an	IV,	strapping	Sunny	down	so	she	didn’t	pull	it	out.	She	wanted	to	fight,	to run.	 She	 wanted	 to	 go	 hiking.	 She	 wanted	 to	 pull	 my	 dirty	 socks	 out	 of	 the hamper	and	play	tug	of	war	until	they	were	reduced	to	rags.	She	wanted	to	wait</p>
<p class="calibre1">until	 Mom	 turned	 off	 the	 lights	 and	 locked	 my	 door	 so	 she	 could	 jump	 on	 my bed	and	snuggle	into	the	warm	spot	beneath	my	arm,	little	snores	all	night	long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Demarius,	 this	 huge	 black	 telepath,	 who	 worked	 security	 for	 the	 building, was	 suddenly	 standing	 beside	 my	 desk.	 His	 wrap-around	 sunglasses	 and	 crisp uniform	said	he	had	power,	but	this	was	Brightside.	No	one	had	any	control	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Damn,	Joe,”	Demarius	said.	“You	cool?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	no	idea	how	long	he’d	been	standing	there	or	what	he’d	heard.	Lying</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	pointless	so	I	just	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Demarius	took	a	step	back	and	sat	down	on	the	edge	of	Sara’s	desk	like	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	planning	on	having	a	deep	conversation.	“You	need	someone	to	talk	to?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 knew	 he	 meant	 Sharon,	 but	 felt	 like	 testing	 him.	 I	 turned	 my	 pad	 so	 he could	see	the	drawing.	“Let’s	talk	about	how	I	wouldn’t	let	her	die.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	need	to	clear	your	head,	Homie.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Demarius	shook	his	head	and	left	the	room.	He	didn’t	want	to	hear	how	Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gentry	had	to	operate	on	my	birthday. </p>
<p class="calibre1">BOTH	 OF	 DR.	 GENTRY’S	 receptionists	 looked	 down,	 saw	 who	 it	 was,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	 away.	 Mary	 Ann,	 the	 one	 with	 braces,	 picked	 up	 the	 phone	 that	 hadn’t rung.	Jessica,	the	freckled	redhead,	got	up,	went	into	the	back.	I	hoped	they	were being	 nice,	 trying	 not	 to	 stare	 at	 my	 sweat	 circles.	 I’d	 jogged	 all	 the	 way	 from school	to	have	an	extra	five	minutes	with	Sunny,	to	tell	her	she’d	be	okay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	thought	they	were	being	funny	with	the	time	cards.	The	pink	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Gentry	made	special	for	me	was	up	on	the	top	slot,	way	out	of	reach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	that	was	nothing	next	to	Dr.	Gentry.	He’d	pass	me	in	the	waiting	room</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	let	his	thoughts	fill	my	head.	Images	of	Mom’s	sweaty	body	underneath	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 knew	 I	 wanted	 to	 punch	 him,	 knew	 every	 violent	 thought	 flowing	 through my	 mind.	 He’d	 just	 smile,	 because	 there	 was	 nothing	 I	 could	 do.	 He	 held Sunny’s	life	in	his	hands.	I	just	had	to	grit	my	teeth	and	take	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pamela	 was	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 hall	 looking	 like	 a	 Q-tip	 with	 her	 rail-thin</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>body	and	puffy	blonde	perm.	Even	if	she	wasn’t	busy	moving	stuff	around	in	the cupboard,	she	wasn’t	the	person	to	ask	for	help.	Pamela	was	one	of	those	people</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 smiled	 real	 big	 all	 the	 time.	 The	 kind	 of	 smile	 people	 give	 when	 they’re really	just	holding	back	a	scream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 a	 few	 minutes,	 the	 exam	 room’s	 door	 swung	 open.	 Nancy	 headed</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	the	hall	looking	at	her	clipboard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 was	 the	 only	 one	 who	 could	 weigh	 the	 big	 dogs.	 She	 knew	 others laughed	behind	her	back	because	she	looked	like	a	man,	but	that	didn’t	stop	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	always	smiling,	real	ones	nothing	like	Pamela’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	so	glad	to	see	her.	I	wanted	her	to	be	the	one	to	give	the	good	news</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	Sunny,	that	she	was	all	better	like	a	miracle.	Nancy	would	have	loved	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">say	that.	She	didn’t	think	I	was	just	a	stupid	kid	who	got	in	the	way.	She	didn’t think	Sunny	wasn’t	important.	She	thought	Sunny	would	be	okay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	waved	Nancy	down	and	pointed	at	the	pink	card.	“Can	you	help	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 tried	 to	 smile,	 but	 it	 crumpled.	 It	 took	 her	 a	 moment	 to	 start	 talking, then	all	she	said	was	follow	her.	She	walked	past	all	the	tables,	the	place	quieter than	ever,	everyone’s	eyes	trained	on	their	patient	or	tool	or	each	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	turned	around	in	front	of	the	door	to	the	last	operating	room.	She	put</p>
<p class="calibre1">both	arms	around	me	and	pulled	me	close.	She	didn’t	say	a	word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	hard	to	breathe	with	my	mouth	smushed	against	her	chest,	but	Nancy</p>
<p class="calibre1">kept	hugging.	She	wanted	to	take	the	pain	away.	She	knew	it	wasn’t	fair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	couldn’t	say	she	was	sorry,	but	she	was,	her	eyes	wet	when	she	stood</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	walked	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	got	super	quiet,	the	occasional	beep	and	buzz	too	loud.	The	door</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	wood	with	a	big	window	too	high	to	look	through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 door	 pushed	 in,	 squealed	 the	 whole	 way	 back.	 Everything	 was	 dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	I	flipped	on	the	switch	and	it	was	way	too	bright,	Sunny	curled	up	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">table	like	she	did	in	that	space	below	my	arm.	The	place	that’d	be	empty	forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 lowered	 the	 lights	 so	 they	 were	 just	 barely	 on.	 I	 stepped	 to	 the	 table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sunny	smelled	like	she	did	the	first	day	I	got	her.	Her	fur	was	soft	except	for	all the	 parts	 shaved	 off.	 They’d	 given	 her	 a	 bath	 and	 closed	 her	 eyes.	 The	 eyes that’d	showed	so	much	love	no	matter	what. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	the	last	time	to	see	Sunny.	Last	time	to	pick	her	up,	hug	her	tight, </p>
<p class="calibre1">let	her	know	she’d	be	missed	every	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	tears	fell	on	Sunny’s	face,	bounced	off	the	bright	collar	that	never	got	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">chance	to	get	old.	From	the	other	room,	Nancy	said,	“He’s	in	here,	Mr.	Nolan” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 door	 opened	 then	 closed.	 Dad	 didn’t	 get	 off	 work	 before	 five	 but	 he was	stepping	up	right	behind	me.	“I’m	sorry,	Joe,”	he	said.	“I	really	am.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crying	 made	 it	 too	 hard	 to	 talk.	 There	 were	 no	 words	 to	 say.	 Everything</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>hurt	and	it	always	would.	Nothing	would	make	that	better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	 put	 his	 hands	 on	 my	 shoulders	 to	 keep	 them	 from	 shrugging	 up	 and down.		In	a	way	he	hadn’t	said	it	before,	Dad	said,	“Control	it,	Joe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	trying	to,	but	Dr.	Gentry	had	killed	Sunny.	I	knew	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	this	hurts.	It	hurts	me	too,”	Dad	said.	He	walked	around	so	I	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	the	sadness	behind	his	glasses.	“But	it’ll	pass	and	you’ll	get	over	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	this.	Not	Sunny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop	 shaking	 your	 head	 and	 listen	 to	 me.”	 He	 held	 my	 chin	 because	 I didn’t.	“You’re	feeling	a	lot	of	things	right	now,	but	you	need	to	relax.”	He	bent down,	 got	 eye	 to	 eye.	 “You’re	 sad.	 Scared.	 Alone.	 Pissed	 off.	 At	 God.	 At	 Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gentry.	Your	mom.	Me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	couldn’t	stop	sobbing.	Sunny	was	dead.	“Look	at	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	 raised	 his	 voice	 to	 cover	 my	 crying,	 not	 because	 he	 was	 mad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Understanding	what	you’re	feeling	is	the	first	step,	but	naming	it’s	not	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	you	got	to	think	about	it.	Rationalize	it.	Use	logic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Logic	said	Sunny	was	dead.	Always	would	be.	Just	a	piece	of	meat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop	it,	Joe.”	Dad	went	back	to	holding	my	shoulders.	“You’re	feeling	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">emotion	that	you’re	in	control	of.	It’s	your	brain.	If	you	want	to	be	happy,	you can	 choose	 to	 be	 happy.”	 Dad’s	 brown	 eyes	 were	 getting	 shiny	 behind	 his glasses.	“If	you	decide	to	be	angry,	that’s	how	you’ll	be.	It	works	in	degrees	and won’t	always	get	rid	of	what	you’re	feeling.	Lots	of	times	it’s	just	postponing	it, but	that’s	alright.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	 put	 his	 hand	 on	 Sunny’s	 head,	 the	 other	 on	 my	 hand.	 “There’ll	 be plenty	of	times	where	you	can	think	about	Sunny	and	miss	her.	Way	too	many</p>
<p class="calibre1">times.	 Then	 you	 can	 cry	 all	 you	 want.”	 Dad	 checked	 over	 his	 shoulder	 and turned	back,	his	face	all	hard.	“But	don’t	ever	do	it	in	front	of	that	prick.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	stood	and	pointed	at	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	table	was	cold,	too	cold	to	put	Sunny	on.	The	whole	room	was	cold	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">smelled	funny.	She	couldn’t	just	lie	there	by	herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	said	my	name	real	slow.	“Knock	it	off	and	put	her	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sunny	went	down	all	relaxed,	legs	going	out	each	way.	Her	nose	was	cold, </p>
<p class="calibre1">not	wet,	no	more	snores. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	more	kiss	and	that’s	it.	It’s	better	that	way,”	Dad	said.	He	knew	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">true,	 thinking	 of	 holding	 his	 first	 dog,	 Brutus,	 while	 the	 shivering	 pooch	 threw up	its	insides	trying	to	get	rid	of	the	poison. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gave	Sunny	one	final	kiss	on	top	of	her	head	and	turned	my	back	on	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	took	off	his	glasses	just	long	enough	to	wipe	his	eyes.	“I’m	proud	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">you.	That’s	what	it	means	to	be	a	man.	It’s	easier	to	be	controlled	by	sadness	and fear,	hatred	and	jealousy,	and	all	that	other	bullshit	than	it	is	to	control	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>The	man	talking	right	then	wasn’t	the	same	man	that	came	home	after	work every	day.	This	one	was	someone	to	look	up	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	no	more	goodbyes,	we	just	went	right	through	the	door,	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">main	 room,	 right	 past	 Donny	 who	 thought	 it	 was	 pretty	 queer	 for	 me	 to	 be holding	 hands	 with	 my	 dad.	 Past	 Felicia	 who	 said	 she	 was	 sorry,	 thought	 poor kid,	that	dog	never	had	a	chance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	counter,	Jessica	said	sorry,	too,	like	it	could	make	it	all	better.	And</p>
<p class="calibre1">maybe	it	did	a	little	because	she	really	meant	it,	her	bottom	lip	shaking	because Sunny	looked	like	her	Princess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tried	to	say	thanks,	but	it	came	out	all	mumbled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jessica	understood.	She	said	to	take	care.	Then	Dr.	Gentry	came	out	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">consultation	room.	He	said	he	was	sorry	but	didn’t	sound	it.	“Go	ahead	and	take</p>
<p class="calibre1">tomorrow	off,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead	 of	 running	 out	 the	 front	 door	 like	 my	 after-work	 dad,	 Dad	 stood right	there	and	put	his	hand	on	my	shoulder.	“Joe	won’t	be	finishing	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gentry	went	red,	used	his	I’m-not-mad	voice.	“It’ll	be	good	for	your	boy	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">learn	the	value	of	hard	work	and	fulfilling	promises.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	already	knows	both	of	those.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	any	idea	how	much	that	dog	cost	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	it	wasn’t	enough	so	we’re	leaving.”	Dad	turned	for	the	door.	“And	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	have	a	problem	with	that	why	don’t	you	take	it	up	with	my	wife?	I’m	sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’ll	be	talking	to	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Gentry	thought	of	Mom	bent	over	his	desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	don’t	think	Dr.	Gentry	even	saw	my	dad’s	fist	before	it	sent	him	crashing</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	left.	The	door	swooshed	shut,	Dad’s	rusty	red	Tercel	parked	at	the	curb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	 opened	 the	 passenger	 door	 for	 me.	 “And	 just	 so	 we’re	 clear,	 I	 said	 try	 to control	your	emotions.	I	didn’t	say	it	always	works.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	NINE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">DEMARIUS	HAD	A	BIG	mouth.	Day	66,	he	heard	me	thinking	about	Belinda, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 woman	 who	 lived	 in	 my	 apartment	 before	 me.	 Everyone	 said	 Belinda</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	nice.	Kept	to	herself.	I	never	met	her,	but	every	time	I	saw	my	tub,	all	I wanted	to	know	was	what	she	was	thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	tub	was	the	reason	for	my	two-minute	showers,	why	I	did	most	of	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">washing	at	the	sink.	I’m	not	superstitious	or	any	of	that,	but	I	didn’t	like	going	in there.	I	had	too	good	of	an	imagination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Was	the	water	real	warm,	your	body	relaxed?	Had	you	always	known	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	right	thing	to	do?	Did	you	question	it	when	you	held	that	razorblade?	When</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 realized	 all	 you	 needed	 was	 sixty	 cents	 of	 steel?	 Not	 even	 that	 because	 all you	really	needed	was	that	tiny	little	tip.	Just	dig	it	in	and	drag	it	back.	And	let	it go.	Let	yourself	flow	away	because	you	finally	did	it.	You	did	what	you	should</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	done	such	a	long	time	ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Demarius	 told	 Sharon	 everything.	 He	 had	 to.	 It	 was	 the	 rule.	 The	 Council said	everyone	had	to	report	thoughts	of	suicide.	It	wasn’t	to	be	taken	lightly.	Too many	people	had	died.	Some	ended	up	in	wheelchairs,	like	Paul. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paul	said	he	was	up	on	the	roof	because	he	used	to	be	a	gymnast.	He	liked</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	freedom.	The	total	control.	He	said	he	slipped,	caught	his	toe	on	the	ledge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	said	someone’d	have	to	be	crazy	to	do	what	he	did,	risk	ending	up	like	him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">confined	to	a	wheelchair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 everyone	 knew	 better.	 Paul	 couldn’t	 control	 his	 thoughts,	 the	 truth rolling	around	in	that	damaged	brain.	His	wheelchair	was	electric.	He	controlled it	with	his	mouth.	He	worked	in	the	same	building	as	me.	The	Council	created	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">special	job	to	keep	him	busy.	No	one	knew	what	he	actually	did.	Everyday	he’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	roll	around	in	his	fancy	chair.	He	had	a	live-in	caretaker,	who’d	dress	him	in a	 black	 sweat	 suit	 and	 matching	 baseball	 cap	 to	 cover	 the	 part	 of	 his	 skull permanently	sunk	in.	I	didn’t	know	Paul	before	the	fall.	Didn’t	know	if	his	eyes were	always	bugged	out	like	that	or	if	that	was	just	the	way	anyone’s	would	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	freefalling	eighty	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">SHARON	TOLD	ME	TO	TAKE	a	seat,	then	said,	“I	know	it’s	difficult.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>“I’m	not	suicidal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Joe... </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 got	 loud	 when	 I	 said,	 “I’m	 not.	 Yes,	 I	 thought	 about	 Belinda.	 But	 she killed	herself	in	my	bathroom.	It	was	just	a	thought.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Calm	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	going	to	kill	myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	nodded.	“I	understand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that	something	you	have	to	say?	That’s	what	they	teach	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	say	it	unless	it’s	true.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	 had	 seen	 me	 at	 my	 lowest,	 heard	 my	 darkest	 thoughts.	 I	 knew	 it wasn’t	her	fault,	but	I	couldn’t	stop	myself.	“This	is	a	fucking	joke.	You	love	it here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	all	the	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 you	 act	 like	 you	 do.	 Is	 it	 better	 in	 Brightside	 because	 you	 didn’t leave	anyone	behind?	No	one	back	home	gives	a	shit	about	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">You	prick. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	felt	like	crawling	into	the	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	 opened	 her	 mouth	 to	 speak,	 then	 closed	 it	 and	 cleared	 her	 throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	second,	she	regained	her	composure	and	said,	“I	left	everyone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither	 of	 us	 said	 a	 word.	 There	 were	 no	 pictures	 up.	 I’d	 figured	 her	 a lonely	workaholic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Six	years	Tom	and	I	were	married,”	she	said.	“Abby	just	turned	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	away	from	those	eyes,	down	to	her	wedding	finger,	the	white	circle</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	skin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	feel	bad,”	Sharon	said.	“No	one	here	knows.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	couldn’t	get	over	how	she	could	keep	that	from	everyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don’t	 think	 about	 them	 during	 the	 day,”	 she	 said.	 “And	 no	 one’s	 ever asked.	No	one	asks	me	anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 said	 I	 was	 sorry.	 “Look,	 it	 was	 just	 a	 thought.	 Are	 you	 saying	 you’ve never	even	had	the	thought?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	not	here	about	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again	 Sharon	 slipped.	 Thought	 about	 the	 first	 time	 she’d	 swallowed	 that bottle	of	pills,	before	she	found	meditation,	inner	peace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	the	first	time,	Sharon	showed	she	was	just	as	broken	as	the	rest	of	us.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt	sorry	for	her,	especially	as	that	stupid	mantra	hummed	in	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sat	up	straight.	“Let’s	talk	about	your	parents,	about	your	mom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	nothing	to	talk	about.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you	hold	so	much	anger.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pretty	sure	every	kid	does.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a>“You’re	not	a	kid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	what	I	mean.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	it’s	time	you	give	them	a	call.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	get	closure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Closure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	need	to	let	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine.	Sure.	Whatever.	I’ll	call	my	parents.	Can	I	go	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	bit	her	lip.	She’d	let	me	into	her	mind,	all	those	sad	moments.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted	 me	 out	 of	 the	 room.	 She	 said,	 “Go	 down	 to	 the	 first	 floor	 to	 pick	 up	 a prepaid	cell.”	She	filled	out	a	form,	gave	it	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	my	way	out,	I	turned	back.	“I’m	sorry	about	your	family.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	gave	me	a	sad	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	clerk	downstairs	handed	over	the	phone.	He	said	it	was	monitored,	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	I	called	anyone	but	the	people	on	Sharon’s	list,	I’d	be	sent	to	the	Cabin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside	the	wind	was	whipping	the	trees,	turning	them	into	curled	fingers, </p>
<p class="calibre1">looking	 like	 they	 were	 ready	 to	 break.	 Snow	 falling	 in	 clumps	 from	 those towering	pines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 jogged	 into	 my	 building,	 headed	 down	 the	 hallway,	 walked	 soft	 on	 the creaky	 carpet.	 Vanessa,	 Sharon’s	 flunky,	 had	 the	 first	 room	 on	 the	 right.	 She probably	had	her	ear	to	the	door,	waiting	for	me	to	walk	by	so	she	could	get	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">one-on-one,	smother	me	with	good	thoughts,	try	her	hand	at	making	me	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vanessa	 said	 all	 I	 had	 to	 do	 was	 listen,	 give	 her	 a	 chance.	 If	 she	 could	 see	 the bright	side,	anyone	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	 and	 his	 shitty	 toupee	 had	 six	 pairs	 of	 shoes	 lining	 the	 hallway,	 a proud	 display	 for	 everyone	 to	 see.	 His	 attempt	 to	 make	 people	 think	 he	 had friends,	but	the	guy	was	a	hermit	who	loved	Lysol,	the	whoosh	whoosh	whoosh</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	that	can	always	going. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	smelled	like	nothing	outside	Ivan’s	bedroom,	but	that’s	because	he’d	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken	to	the	Cabin	for	trying	to	steal	a	car,	as	if	he	could	actually	get	through	the gate.	Alex,	the	first	anorexic	man	I’d	come	across,	was	taking	bets	on	if	we’d	see Ivan	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 worst	 was	 Erica,	 the	 girl	 who	 doused	 herself	 in	 perfume	 to	 cover	 her lactose	intolerance.	She	kept	her	stereo	all	the	way	up	to	hide	the	awfulness	she poured	into	her	toilet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	day	was	the	same,	the	smells	never	changing.	No	guests	staying	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">long	enough	to	add	their	own	scent.	Everyone	on	this	floor	usually	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	of	my	neighbors	had	been	married,	and	some	still	were,	probably	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">loneliest	people	I’d	ever	met.	Brightsiders	still	went	out,	hung	out,	fucked	their</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a><img src="index-85_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">brains	out.	They	just	went	about	their	business	when	they	were	done,	something</p>
<p class="calibre1">always	keeping	people	apart.	Things	better	left	unsaid	turning	us	into	what	we’d become,	not	trusting	others	enough	to	let	them	close.	Not	allowing	ourselves	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">become	vulnerable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 I	 finally	 got	 to	 my	 door,	 I	 found	 another	 present.	 I	 threw	 it	 in	 the closet	with	the	rest	of	the	crap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crap	 just	 like	 the	 rest	 of	 my	 apartment.	 It	 came	 with	 the	 room,	 what Belinda	left	behind.	The	Ikea	dresser	with	the	27-inch	TV	taking	up	the	top	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 light	 blue	 armchair	 with	 sweat	 stained	 armrests	 stuffed	 in	 the	 corner.	 The tiny	table	beside	it,	a	place	to	put	my	drinks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 cracks	 shooting	 out	 from	 the	 ceiling	 fan,	 which	 hadn’t	 worked	 since Belinda’s	first	suicide	attempt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Erica’s	stereo	was	shaking	the	walls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	on	the	bed,	flipped	open	the	phone,	and	powered	it	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	WAS	EIGHT,	SITTING	Indian-style	on	our	living	room	couch,	just	me	and	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rubik’s	Cube.	The	TV	was	off	because	Mom	figured	watching	all	that	crap	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">part	 of	 my	 problem.	 She	 was	 in	 the	 kitchen	 waiting	 for	 Dad.	 He’d	 just	 pulled into	the	driveway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Rubik’s	Cube	wasn’t	mine.	Steven	said	I	could	borrow	it	until	I	figured</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	out.	I’d	had	it	over	a	year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	a	bunch	of	people	who	couldn’t	figure	out	the	puzzle,	but	most</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	them	said	it	was	because	they	weren’t	trying.	If	they	wanted	to	waste	a	few</p>
<p class="calibre1">minutes	of	their	life,	they	could	do	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	 been	 trying,	 failing.	 Steven	 even	 let	 me	 watch	 him	 solve	 it	 real	 slow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five	times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	staring	at	that	stupid	block,	the	center	square	a	smudgy	white,	eight</p>
<p class="calibre1">bright	 yellow	 ones	 circled	 around	 it.	 It	 was	 the	 closest	 I	 ever	 got,	 just	 two squares	in	the	wrong	place.	The	white	one	on	one	side,	yellow	on	the	other.	No</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter	how	many	twists	and	turns,	it	was	always	those	two	squares. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 back	 door	 opened	 then	 slammed	 shut.	 Dad’s	 feet	 stomping	 into	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">kitchen.	I	held	onto	that	cube	and	waited	for	him	to	toss	his	keys	onto	the	table then	say	goddamn	it	when	they	slid	right	off.	Like	they	always	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	 stayed	 in	 the	 kitchen	 where	 I	 couldn’t	 see,	 him	 and	 Mom	 talking	 too low	to	hear.	Ice	clinked,	the	fridge	opened	and	closed.	A	soda	fizzed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	way	too	far	for	their	thoughts	to	be	heard,	but	I	knew	they	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">talking	about	me.	That	I	was	such	a	disappointment. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>Mom	 had	 her	 proof.	 My	 IQ	 test	 from	 school.	 Knowing	 Mom,	 she	 was gloating,	shoving	that	paper	in	Dad’s	face,	saying	I	told	you	so.	It	made	me	keep trying	with	that	cube.	If	I	concentrated,	I	just	knew	I	could	get	it	right.	I	wasn’t an	idiot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	left	the	kitchen	and	stopped	next	to	the	dining	room	table	in	her	green</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	white	checkered	sundress	like	she	was	a	good	housewife.	She	gave	me	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	her	quick	smiles	and	said,	“That’s	enough	of	that,	Joey.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	to	the	TV,	saw	my	sad	face	staring	back	at	me	in	all	that	black.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wiped	off	the	tears	and	looked	back	at	Mom.	Mom	was	done	with	me,	already	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	hallway,	closing	the	door	behind	her.	A	few	seconds	later,	the	shower	started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	no	noise	from	the	kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Up	until	then	I	was	never	a	cheater.	Partly	because	I	thought	I’d	never	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">away	with	it.	Partly	because	I	just	knew	it	was	wrong.	That’s	what	Dad	always</p>
<p class="calibre1">said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 soft	 clink	 of	 ice	 cubes	 came	 every	 few	 seconds.	 Dad	 was	 still	 in	 there, drinking	his	drink,	most	likely	figuring	out	what	to	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	I	did	next	wasn’t	hard.	Corey	did	it	all	the	time.	He’d	bet	five	dollars</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 he	 could	 solve	 it	 in	 under	 five	 minutes.	 He	 didn’t	 always	 get	 paid,	 but	 he never	lost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 put	 my	 fingernail	 under	 the	 corner	 of	 that	 white	 square	 and	 raised	 it	 up slow,	 careful	 not	 to	 scrape	 off	 the	 sticky	 stuff.	 I	 did	 the	 same	 thing	 with	 the yellow	square	on	the	other	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fridge	opened	again	and	Dad	poured	another	drink.	I	concentrated	real</p>
<p class="calibre1">hard	 and	 laid	 down	 the	 white	 square,	 made	 sure	 it	 was	 lined	 up.	 The	 fridge closed.	Dad	headed	for	the	dining	room	and	I	placed	the	yellow	square,	rubbed	it smooth	 with	 my	 thumb	 and	 turned	 it	 over	 so	 the	 red,	 white,	 and	 blue	 sides showed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	 stepped	 into	 the	 dining	 room	 and	 stopped	 at	 the	 table,	 his	 wrinkled white	 shirt,	 his	 tired	 blue	 slacks.	 He	 set	 his	 wallet	 and	 keys	 down	 so	 quietly	 I barely	heard	them	over	the	shower. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 took	 a	 drink	 and	 turned	 toward	 me.	 From	 his	 spot	 at	 the	 table,	 Dad spoke	way	softer	than	normal,	like	he	might	have	to	come	close.	“So,	you	want</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	tell	me	what’s	wrong?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	took	off	his	glasses.	He	needed	the	top	of	them	for	the	TV,	the	bottom</p>
<p class="calibre1">part	for	reading.	I’d	only	seen	them	off	when	he	was	in	bed.	He	set	them	next	to his	wallet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	said,	“You’ve	been	crying.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	couldn’t	look	at	Dad	so	I	stared	at	the	TV.	“I’m	not	crying.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>Dad	 came	 closer	 and	 stood	 in	 the	 way,	 his	 white	 button-down	 my	 new screen.	“Don’t	do	that,	Joey.	Look	at	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	I	liked	about	Dad	was	how	he	usually	stayed	on	point,	only	speaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	thoughts.	“It’s	okay	to	cry	once	in	a	while,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said	okay	because	I	wished	he’d	just	leave	me	alone,	forget	all	about	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	another	part	of	me	wanted	him	to	sit	down	and	see	the	cube,	understand	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">maybe	the	numbers	lied.	I	wasn’t	as	dumb	as	they	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	stepped	right	up	to	me.	“Can	I	sit?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 wasn’t	 used	 to	 Dad	 asking	 permission	 or	 him	 being	 close	 so	 I	 just	 sat there,	didn’t	say	a	word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	 picked	 up	 the	 Rubik’s	 Cube	 and	 sat	 down	 beside	 me,	 the	 hair	 on	 his arm	touching	mine.	The	cube	was	in	his	far	hand	but	Dad	didn’t	even	glance	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">it,	those	naked	brown	eyes	of	his	really	looking	deep.	“So	what’s	going	on	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wasn’t	used	to	Dad’s	smell.	It	was	too	clean,	like	he	hadn’t	done	anything</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	work.	Mom	smelled	more	like	a	man	than	Dad	did.	Underneath	all	that	sweet, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a	light	touch	of	cologne	always	there,	always	different. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 water	 stopped	 but	 neither	 of	 us	 asked	 why	 Mom	 needed	 to	 wash	 up before	her	tennis	lesson.	I	didn’t	say	it	was	her	second	shower	of	the	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what	is	it?”	he	said.	“Why	were	you	crying?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	dumb.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 pictured	 the	 test	 lady,	 the	 one	 who	 wanted	 to	 do	 things	 to	 me.	 Awful things.	Naked	and	alone	in	her	office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	jerked	back.	I	didn’t	know	he	was	like	me	at	the	time,	but	I	suddenly</p>
<p class="calibre1">wondered	if	I	wasn’t	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	picturing	the	test	lady,	the	one	he’d	never	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	my	eyes	widened,	I	just	heard	a	hum,	Dad’s	way	of	pushing	out	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughts,	the	things	he	didn’t	want	me	to	hear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	kept	his	eyes	on	me,	but	started	playing	with	the	cube,	turning	it	over	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	hand.	“Those	tests	aren’t	all	they’re	made	out	to	be.	We	shouldn’t	have	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	take	it	in	the	first	place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cuz	you	know	I	wouldn’t	do	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 not	 true.”	 Dad	 turned	 the	 cube	 even	 slower.	 “And	 don’t	 say	 cuz unless	you	want	everyone	to	think	you’re	stupid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everyone’s	gonna	anyways.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	one	will	know	about	your	score	unless	you	tell	them.	You’re	smart	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	don’t	want	you	to	ever	think	different.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I’m	not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	you	think	I’m	smart?	You’re	just	like	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a><img src="index-88_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">That	almost	made	the	tears	come	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	 gripped	 the	 cube,	 had	 it	 so	 the	 yellow	 side	 was	 up.	 “But	 being	 book smart	isn’t	what’s	important	and	you	need	to	understand	that.	Scores	on	tests	and grades	in	school	don’t	mean	squat.	Your	mom	thinks	they	do,	but,	between	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	me,	what	you	have	is	more	important.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	he	meant	hearing	thoughts	and	I	couldn’t	breathe.	How	much	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	heard,	what	things	had	I	thought	about	him? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 kind,”	 he	 said.	 “You	 have	 a	 big	 heart.	 You’re	 going	 to	 be	 a	 good man.	You’re	special.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	relaxed	a	bit,	but	it	was	hard	to	listen.	I	looked	him	in	the	eyes.	“You	think so?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	it’s	true.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 finished	 his	 drink,	 set	 it	 down	 on	 the	 coffee	 table	 and	 wiped	 his	 lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	got	to	be	careful,	though.	You	have	a	real	gift,	but	you	have	to	remember</p>
<p class="calibre1">who	you	are.		You	can’t	always	tell	people	what	they	want	to	hear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	won’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	do	it	all	the	time,”	he	said.	“And	I	totally	understand	it.	It	feels	good</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 everyone	 to	 love	 you,	 but	 sometimes	 the	 right	 thing	 isn’t	 going	 to	 make people	happy.	But	it’s	what	you	have	to	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nodding	seemed	like	the	only	thing	I	was	capable	of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	 turned	 to	 the	 cube,	 acted	 like	 it	 was	 the	 first	 time	 he	 saw	 it.	 “You solved	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 started	 to	 say	 yes,	 wanted	 to	 make	 him	 proud,	 but	 after	 what	 he’d	 just said,	I	told	him	the	truth.	“I	switched	the	last	two	stickers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	laughed,	told	me	I	was	learning,	that	he	was	proud.	Mom	walked	by	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	towel	and	rolled	her	eyes.	She	thought	Dad	was	coddling	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">DAY	 66.	 THE	 SUN	 WAS	 setting	 and	 I	 suddenly	 had	 this	 urge	 to	 call	 Mom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 Sharon	 suggested	 I	 give	 her	 a	 ring,	 I	 had	 no	 intention	 of	 following through,	 but	 here,	 in	 this	 room	 with	 a	 closet	 of	 weird	 gifts,	 I	 wanted	 to	 yell	 at someone.	I	punched	in	the	numbers	faster	than	I	could	think	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	phone	rang	and	I	tried	to	remember	what	she	sounded	like,	if	I’d	ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 a	 real	 conversation	 with	 her.	 Once	 I’d	 moved	 out,	 I	 basically	 only	 heard from	my	father.	It	rang	again	and	I	almost	hung	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	used	the	same	greeting	she	used	whenever	a	guy	would	call	and	Dad</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	around.	“Who’s	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh...” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>“Joey?”	she	whispered.	“Is	that	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 setting	 red	 sun	 filled	 my	 window,	 everything	 beyond	 it.	 I	 brought	 the phone	back	to	my	ear.	“Yeah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	she	was	sorry	to	hear	it,	she	said,	“Oh	my	God.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	realized	it	was	late	in	Ohio.	“Did	I	wake	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	not	at	all.	Are	you	alright?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sounded	genuine	when	she	said	she	missed	me.	“So	much,	I	really	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly,	I	was	three	years	old	again,	just	happy	to	hear	her	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hate	this,”	she	said.	“I’ve	tried	to	call,	but	they	won’t	put	me	through.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	scared.	Have	they	hurt	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I’m	fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	sound	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 anyone	 had	 been	 listening	 to	 the	 call,	 they	 probably	 would’ve	 believed her,	the	way	she	sounded	so	sweet.	“You	know	you	can	call	me	anytime,	right? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	so	glad	you	called.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	how	you	been,	Joey?	What’s	it	like?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 rubbed	 my	 temple,	 tried	 to	 quiet	 the	 voice	 telling	 me	 to	 hang	 up.	 “It’s different.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	seems	loud.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	my	neighbor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	what’s	his	name?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh.	Are	they	nice?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	someone	was	listening	in,	waiting	for	me	to	slip	up.	I	suddenly	felt</p>
<p class="calibre1">trapped,	felt	the	anger	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 sure	 you’re	 meeting	 other	 people.	 Like	 you.	 That	 must	 be	 exciting? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	be	yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	that	mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing.	You’re	always	smart,	sometimes	too	smart—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	I	was	an	idiot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	sounded	a	lot	more	like	the	woman	I	remembered,	when	she	said,	“I</p>
<p class="calibre1">never	once	called	you	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	thought	I	was	stupid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joey...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	did.	I	was	there.	I	got	a	ninety-one	on	my	IQ	test.	And	you	thought	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	an	idiot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	opened	my	eyes,	looked	out	the	window,	everything	red. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>Suddenly,	 I	 was	 five	 years	 old	 coming	 home	 from	 the	 snowstorm,	 hating my	mother.	I	said,	“It	wasn’t	my	fault.	The	stuff	she	was	thinking	made	it	so	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t	think.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	test	lady.	She	wanted	to	hold	me,	feel	my	skin	on	hers.	She	wanted	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">breathe	in	my	hair.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	didn’t	tell	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	say	what?	I’d	been	hearing	thoughts	my	whole	life,	knew	damn	well</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	hated	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	you	ever	say	that!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?	Should	I	just	think	it?	Does	that	make	it	better?	Does	it	make	it	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">less	true?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop	it,	Joey.	Stop	it	right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	did.	But	only	because	I	was	done.	I	heard	the	hurt	in	her	voice,	even	if	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	barely	there.	That	would	have	to	be	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that	why	you	called?	To	accuse	me?	Point	fingers?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	about	it	a	minute,	loved	not	having	to	hear	what	she	was	thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imagining	 her	 heart	 being	 crushed.	 “Closure.”	 Sharon’s	 word	 flying	 out	 of	 my mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	 do	 you	 think	 I	 feel?”	 Mom	 said,	 “You	 don’t	 think	 you	 owe	 me	 an apology?	Listening	in	to	whatever	you	wanted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	my	time	to	answer,	chose	to	speak	the	truth.	“I	guess	I	do	owe	you	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">apology.	For	the	time	when	I	was	six	and	you	were	fucking	Brian’s	stepdad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	talk	that	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	 all	 you	 could	 think	 about	 all	 day	 long	 was	 how	 much	 you	 loved him.	How	you	wanted	to	fly	away,	how	it’d	be	so	much	better.”	I	looked	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sky,	wishing	I	could	turn	back	time,	put	her	on	that	plane.	“How	he	was	going	to send	you	to	New	York,	you’d	only	have	to	see	me	when	you	wanted	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joey,	I	always	loved	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sorry	for	giving	you	the	guilt	trip.	I	should	have	let	you	abandon	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	things	wouldn’t	have	gotten	so	screwed	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	make	it	seem	like	I	thought	bad	things	all	the	time,”	Mom	said.	“What</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	all	the	good	thoughts	I	had?	Don’t	those	count	for	something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Should	they?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	you	dare	tell	me	there	weren’t	times	you	hated	me.	I	listened	to	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">scream	you	wished	I	was	dead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	kept	quiet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 natural	 to	 have	 bad	 thoughts	 every	 once	 in	 a	 while.	 It’s	 natural	 to	 be upset	 and	 tired	 and	 cranky.	 It’s	 natural	 to	 not	 be	 satisfied,	 to	 want	 something</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>more.”	 She	 paused	 like	 she	 had	 something	 important	 to	 say,	 then	 I	 heard	 the sobs.	 “You	 think	 it	 was	 easy	 living	 in	 that	 house	 with	 you	 and	 your	 father, leaving	 nothing	 inside	 my	 head.	 Ripping	 it	 out	 whenever	 you	 wanted.	 I	 could have	left.	I	thought	about	it.	And	yeah,	I	took	comfort	in	the	arms	of	other	men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	deserved	some	time	to	myself,	away	from	you	and	your	dad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Poor	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	no	idea	what	it	was	like.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	put	Dad	on	the	phone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	not	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	I	have	to	go.	I	only	have	a	certain	amount	of	minutes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joey,	please.	I	don’t	want	you	to	hate	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	can	you	say	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 know,	 it	 wouldn’t	 even	 surprise	 me	 if	 you	 were	 the	 one	 who	 turned me	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 pictured	 Saul,	 that	 douchebag	 making	 the	 call.	 I	 pictured	 his	 fat	 fingers and	that	shit-eating	grin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	everything	changed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	would	never	turn	you	in,	Joey.	Never.	And	when	I	found	out	your	father</p>
<p class="calibre1">did,	I	felt	like	I	was	going	to	die.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	stomach	churned	acid.	“You’re	sick	in	the	head.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	why	he	did	it.	I’m	so	sorry...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 don’t	 remember	 letting	 go	 of	 the	 phone,	 but	 I	 heard	 it	 crack	 against	 the floor,	my	mother	sounding	like	she	was	screaming	from	the	bottom	of	a	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	foot	stomped	 down	on	the	 phone,	cracking	it,	 shattering	her	goddamn</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Dad	turned	me	in.	Just	handed	me	over. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 saw	 the	 closet.	 Opened	 it.	 All	 those	 fucking	 gifts.	 I	 flung	 them	 from	 the closet.	Ripped	them	open.	The	little	swan	figurine,	I	smashed	it	against	the	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 fishing	 pole,	 I	 snapped	 in	 two.	 Everything	 obliterated.	 Tiny	 pieces	 flying across	the	room,	sliding	under	my	bed,	cracking	against	the	window.	I	destroyed</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	all	and	collapsed.	My	own	father.	The	man	who	would	never	give	up	on	me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">told	me	he’d	always	be	there.	No	matter	what. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through	my	tear-bubbled	eyes,	I	saw	a	tiny	piece	of	metal.	Curved,	shiny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Resting	 right	 in	 front	 of	 my	 face	 on	 the	 floor.	 My	 hand	 reached	 out.	 I	 held	 it under	the	light.	So	small	and	hard	and	silver,	and	it	wasn’t	the	first	time	I’d	seen it.	Felt	it	pressed	against	my	finger	as	a	kid. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">No... </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Frantically,	I	crawled	across	the	floor,	sifting	through	all	the	broken	bits,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>tuning	fork	that	wasn’t	really	a	tuning	fork.	The	fishing	pole	snapped	in	two,	the bottom	part	hollowed	out.	The	metal	picture	frame	with	the	strange	spring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	coming	into	focus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 hands	 putting	 it	 together.	 Dropping	 the	 bolt	 slide	 into	 place	 like	 Dad showed	me.	Screwing	the	barrel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	ten	minutes,	there	it	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eight	 pounds	 of	 power.	 American	 metal.	 The	 shotgun	 Dad	 got	 when</p>
<p class="calibre1">Grandpa	decided	a	mouthful	of	buckshot	beat	cancer	hands	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	was	an	only	kid,	just	like	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 stock’s	 been	 rubbed	 smooth,	 the	 last	 bit	 of	 sun	 shining	 on	 the	 wood, bouncing	off	the	steel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	used	to	say	an	empty	gun	was	useless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 searched	 under	 the	 bed,	 gathered	 everything,	 but	 they	 weren’t	 here.	 I wondered	if	Dad	had	forgotten.	Or	if	I’d	have	to	wait	until	his	next	gift. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	there	on	the	shelf,	I	had	my	answer.	I	walked	over	and	picked	up	the	D-</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cell	batteries,	the	ones	that	didn’t	fit	Billy	Bass,	the	ones	too	light	in	my	hands.	I began	 peeling	 the	 label,	 saw	 the	 plastic	 red	 shell.	 Under	 an	 inch.	 Thirty-eight grams.	Eight	tiny	balls	to	cause	so	much	damage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	shell	slipped	into	the	receiver	with	a	soft	click	like	it	was	meant	to	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	first	time	I	loaded	this	thing	without	Dad	over	my	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	heard	his	voice	in	my	head:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Never	be	afraid	when	you	pull	the	trigger. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Is	this	what	he	wanted?	All	these	stupid	gifts	to	give	me	a	way	out? </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	hand	ran	over	the	stock,	smoothed	shiny	from	years	of	handling.	It	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	piece	of	history	to	be	passed	on,	the	history	of	my	grandfather’s	final	shot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pushed	in	the	shotgun’s	safety	then	popped	it	back.	The	little	circle	was	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">red.	 Red	 like	 the	 sun.	 Like	 the	 rage	 eating	 at	 my	 mind,	 making	 me	 want	 to scream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	raised	the	shotgun,	liked	how	it	felt.	Something	real.	Something	solid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad’s	voice	still	in	my	head:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Be	a	man	and	deal	with	it. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	back	at	the	sun,	my	eyes	hurting,	chest	hurting,	everything	fucking</p>
<p class="calibre1">hurting.	I	wanted	it	to	end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	racked	the	shotgun,	couldn’t	hear	Dad’s	voice	anymore.	The	man	who	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">supposed	to	take	care	of	me.	The	man	that	was	supposed	to	be	there,	to	love	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	matter	what. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	guided	the	barrel	into	place,	the	metal	cool	under	my	skin.	I	put	my	thumb</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	trigger	guard.	The	barrel	pressed	against	my	chin,	keeping	it	up	like	Mom always	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a>Head	high.	Eyes	straight	ahead.	My	last	sunset.	Seeing	only	red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	yelling	at	me	to	just	fucking	do	it.	Like	Belinda.	Like	Grandpa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	all	the	other	Brightsiders.	The	ones	smart	enough	to	escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	then	I	pictured	Paul	breathing	into	that	tube	to	make	his	electric	chair</p>
<p class="calibre1">roll.	I	pictured	my	mangled	face,	some	nurse	cleaning	the	shit	out	of	my	pants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pictured	Danny	pushing	me	through	the	Square,	everyone	thinking,  <i class="calibre4">What</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">a	fucking	dumbshit.	Couldn’t	even	kill	himself. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	shotgun	fell	against	my	lap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father’s	one	simple	request	and	I	couldn’t	even	do	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	just	ran. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	TEN</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">DAY	100	AND	I’M	JUST	trying	to	get	to	work.	Walking	down	the	sidewalk,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning	 air	 so	 cold.	 The	 helicopter	 is	 still	 circling,	 which	 means	 they	 haven’t found	Wayne.	That’s	good,	means	the	Boots	are	busy.	Busy	means	they	won’t	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">checking	my	apartment,	the	closet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	running	the	plan	over	in	my	head	when	I	see	a	group	of	people	outside</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lodge	 Two.	 They’re	 watching	 guys	 in	 white	 coats	 wheeling	 someone	 out	 on	 a gurney.	 There’s	 no	 hurry,	 because	 whoever	 it	 is	 isn’t	 moving	 under	 the	 black plastic	 bag.	 I	 know	 I	 should	 keep	 moving,	 get	 to	 work,	 look	 like	 everything’s normal,	but	I	find	myself	getting	closer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 see	 Tommy,	 the	 nineteen-year-old	 punk	 with	 his	 bright	 orange	 Mohawk, and	ask	him	what’s	going	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Another	one	bites	the	dust,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	think	about	my	closet,	knowing	it’s	just	getting	started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palmer,	 the	 only	 Boot	 I	 know	 by	 name,	 is	 taking	 statements.	 He’s	 got	 his aviator	sunglasses	and	fuck	you	attitude.	He	catches	me	staring	and	I	don’t	blink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palmer’s	 the	 Boot	 who	 almost	 put	 a	 bullet	 in	 my	 head,	 the	 day	 I	 thought Michelle	was	coming	to	save	me,	when	I	ran	out	in	the	street	waving	my	arms</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	an	idiot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	grabs	my	arm.	Sheriff	Melvin	and	that	bushy	white	mustache. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 supposed	 to	 be	 at	 work,	 aren’t	 you,	 Joe?”	 The	 way	 he	 says	 it,	 I know	he’s	telling	me	to	move	along,	but	I	ask	who	died. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sheila	Clark.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sheila,	 the	 one	 who	 saw	 me	 with	 Krystal,	 the	 one	 who	 swore	 she’d	 never tell	Rachel.	Swore	she’d	never	say	a	goddamn	word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Melvin	wipes	crumbs	off	his	shirt.	“You	know	anything	about	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	were	you	last	night?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“People	saw	you	running	all	over	town.	What	were	you	doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Couldn’t	sleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	do	some	laundry?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sheriff	Melvin	steps	in,	sniffs.	“A	lot	of	bleach.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a><img src="index-95_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	like	I	said,	I	couldn’t	sleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Melvin	 takes	 off	 his	 sunglasses.	 I	 hadn’t	 really	 seen	 his	 eyes	 before,	 how they	were	so	open,	trying	to	look	like	hey,	remember,	I’m	on	your	team. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palmer’s	staring	at	me,	smiling	all	smug,	wanting	me	to	know	when	this	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	he	might	finish	the	job.	I	give	him	a	nod	to	say	my	schedule’s	wide	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Melvin	thinks	about	reaching	for	his	gun,	shoving	it	in	my	face,	yelling	I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	dumb	son	of	a	bitch.	The	sort	of	thing	he	used	to	do	back	in	the	real	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	should	get	to	work,”	I	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Melvin	says	that’s	a	good	idea.	He	waits	until	I’m	crossing	the	street	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	heads	back	into	the	crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	I	keep	walking,	not	running	like	Day	66,	after	I	found	out	my	father	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	one	who	turned	me	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	CAN’T	TELL	YOU	WHERE	I	was	running	after	I’d	hung	up	on	Mom.	I	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">kept	going,	through	the	dark	and	desolate	park	and	into	the	woods.	I’d	made	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">three	steps	when	my	foot	sank	into	the	snow,	cold	rising	over	my	shoe,	seeping</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	my	sock.	I	yanked	my	foot	right	out	of	my	shoe,	bent	over	and	pulled	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	with	a	loud	 <i class="calibre4">shhhlopp</i>.	There	wasn’t	any	grass	nearby	so	I	took	off	my	sock and	wiped	down	my	shoe,	cleaned	it	out	as	best	I	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 both	 shoes	 back	 on,	 I	 continued	 up	 the	 trail	 and	 looked	 for	 signs	 of someone	else,	kept	an	eye	out	for	deep	snow.	The	sweet	smell	took	me	back	to	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	 I	 had	 hope.	 Back	 to	 all	 the	 hikes	 I’d	 taken	 with	 Dad.	 The	 hikes	 Mom couldn’t	go	on	because	her	knees	were	acting	up.	How	we	all	pretended	it	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing	to	do	with	how	much	time	she	spent	on	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	I	pictured	Dad	on	the	phone,	telling	someone	to	arrest	his	son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 took	 me	 a	 few	 minutes	 to	 get	 to	 the	 thick	 pine	 where	 it	 looked	 like	 the trail	ended	but	really	just	whipped	around	to	the	right.	I	was	back	at	the	tree.	A rough	heart	carved	into	the	bark	with	my	name	on	top,	a	small	heart	beneath	it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Michelle’s	name	ex’d	out	at	the	bottom.	Rachel’s	name,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	women	I’d	hurt,	the	pain	I’d	caused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	kept	walking	for	hours,	paying	just	enough	attention	to	stay	away	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fence	line.	The	wind	doing	its	best	to	knock	me	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly,	a	huge	cracking	sound	filled	the	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	spun	and	watched	as	a	huge	tree	slowly	toppled	to	the	earth.	It	landed	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	thud	and	bounced	right	past	me,	knocked	over	two	small	trees	before	coming</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	a	stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	boulder,	then	two,	rolled	down	the	mountain	and	nestled	up	against	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>fallen	pine.	Several	other	large	rocks	were	scattered	up	above.	I	made	my	way	to them	and	stood	in	front	of	a	half-covered	cave	someone	had	been	hiding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fence	line	was	up	another	couple	hundred	feet,	but	sometimes	Rangers</p>
<p class="calibre1">roamed.	I	looked	around.	The	woods	were	silent,	no	one	in	sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	had	given	me	a	flashlight	keychain	and	I	flicked	it	on.	Wood	beams</p>
<p class="calibre1">braced	the	rough	walls	carved	out	with	a	pick.	Little	metal	tracks	snaked	into	the darkness.	I	followed	them,	my	feet	crunching	over	the	dirt.	The	tunnel	seemed	to go	on	forever,	and	I	started	to	fear	another	tree	toppling,	crashing	into	the	cave, trapping	me	in	there	forever.	But	I	pressed	on,	continued	down	the	steep	slope, </p>
<p class="calibre1">needing	to	know	where	this	led. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 must	 have	 gone	 half	 a	 mile	 before	 I	 finally	 saw	 light,	 that	 full	 moon shining	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 shaft.	 My	 heart	 pumped	 and	 I	 thought	 about	 all	 those island	 getaways	 I’d	 been	 selling,	 pictured	 myself	 on	 the	 beach	 drinking something	cold	as	the	waves	crashed	and	spread	up	to	my	toes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	then	I	got	to	the	end	of	the	shaft,	a	tiny	outcrop	on	the	edge	of	the	cliff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 heart	 stopped.	 The	 bridge	 that	 had	 once	 connected	 Brightside	 to	 the	 next peak	 had	 been	 destroyed.	 Two	 hundred	 feet	 down.	 I	 threw	 myself	 against	 the ground,	shut	my	eyes.	My	stomach	flopping	around.	Every	inch	of	me	pouring</p>
<p class="calibre1">sweat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	two	hundred	feet	wasn’t	a	mile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	a	lot	of	rope	I	could	make	it.	Just	not	with	this	wind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 hadn’t	 thought	 I’d	 been	 up	 there	 that	 long,	 but	 my	 watch	 showed	 I	 had two	hours	to	get	to	work.	As	quick	as	I	could	I	made	my	way	back	up	the	shaft. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	no	way	I	was	leaving	my	new	secret	exposed	so	I	gathered	rocks	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">piled	them	in	front	of	the	entrance.	I	swept	huge	mounds	of	snow	over	it	as	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sun	peeked	over	the	horizon.	It	wasn’t	perfect,	but	it’d	have	to	do.	I	only	had	ten minutes	to	be	at	my	desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 pants	 were	 in	 decent	 shape	 and	 I’d	 clean	 off	 my	 shoes	 better	 at	 the office.	My	jacket	was	a	mess	so	I	stripped	it	off	and	wadded	it	into	a	ball,	walked over	to	the	wall	of	rocks.	Real	quick	and	quiet,	I	moved	a	boulder	near	the	top</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	tossed	the	jacket	into	the	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	stepped	out	of	the	woods,	it	was	light	enough	for	me	to	put	on	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">sunglasses.	I	cut	across	the	wet	grass	and	headed	for	the	southern	archway.	That last	 part	 of	 the	 park	 was	 always	 the	 hardest	 for	 me.	 the	 Cabin	 up	 the	 pebbled path	on	the	left.	The	dog	park	to	my	right.	The	one	that’d	make	me	start	thinking about	Sunny	and	Lily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 got	 on	 the	 sidewalk,	 Super	 Pawn	 directly	 ahead,	 a	 name	 too	 big	 for	 the one	tiny	window.	It’d	been	a	while	since	I’d	looked	inside.	I	usually	avoided	the store	because	Robert	was	always	hanging	out	front,	playing	with	his	voice	box, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>trying	to	get	someone	to	talk	to	him,	make	him	feel	like	a	person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	display	had	a	little	of	everything,	mostly	rings.	The	tennis	bracelet	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 its	 own,	 center	 stage.	 I	 couldn’t	 see	 the	 inside	 of	 it,	 but	 I	 knew	 Belinda’s initials	were	engraved	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 was	 wondering	 how	 Robert	 got	 the	 diamonds	 so	 sparkly	 when	 I	 walked right	 into	 the	 payphone.	 My	 shoulder	 smacked	 the	 glass	 dome	 hard	 enough	 to turn	 me	 toward	 the	 beauty	 salon	 and	 dry	 cleaners	 across	 the	 street,	 no	 one	 in either	place	to	see	what	an	idiot	I	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	 when	 I	 saw	 the	 orange	 jumpsuits	 coming	 with	 their	 shovels.	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	about	heading	the	other	way,	but	I	needed	to	get	to	my	desk.	Needed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">look	like	everything	was	normal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 tried	 to	 control	 my	 thoughts,	 tried	 to	 think	 about	 anything	 but	 the mineshaft,	my	escape.	But	I	couldn’t	help	it.	I	finally	had	a	way	out,	just	not	the way	Dad	wanted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	arm	swung	out	and	grabbed	my	shirt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	King	and	that	nasty	beard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Momma’s	boy	has	a	secret.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	threw	his	hand	off,	kept	moving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	called	out,	“Don’t	go	leaving	without	me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“King!”	the	guard	yelled.	“Shut	your	damn	mouth	or	I’ll	do	it	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	office	elevator	doors	opened,	I	had	to	squint	my	eyes.	The	sixth</p>
<p class="calibre1">floor	was	always	too	bright	and	my	head	felt	ready	to	split.	Nearly	every	inch	of every	wall	was	covered	with	ridiculous	posters	of	exotic	locales. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Until	this	moment,	I	hadn’t	been	able	to	look	at	them.	The	bungalow	sitting</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 foot	 above	 the	 Tahitian	 clear	 blue	 waters.	 The	 massive	 Swiss	 Alps,	 the	 sun shining	 off	 the	 snow-covered	 ski	 slopes.	 The	 promise	 of	 the	 pyramids,	 the adventure	of	an	African	Safari. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	 this	 moment	 they	 had	 been	 brutal	 reminders	 of	 all	 the	 exciting places	I’d	never	see.	But	now,	with	the	mineshaft,	I	just	might. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Changing	out	of	my	shirt	was	a	priority,	but	first	I	had	to	sit	down.	I	had	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	my	shit	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	squeezed	between	the	desk	and	the	wall	and	dropped	into	my	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 body	 was	 already	 feeling	 like	 one	 big	 bruise	 from	 lifting	 those	 rocks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	scraped	up	my	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	Extra-Strength	Excedrin	was	on	the	desk,	always	in	reach.	I	popped	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	 they	 could	 actually	 take	 away	 my	 pain.	 I’d	 need	 the	 whole	 bottle	 for	 that, but	with	my	luck	it’d	just	make	me	sick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pulled	out	the	shirt	from	my	desk.	Carlos	suggested	I	have	a	spare	after	I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">spilled	 toner	 in	 the	 copy	 room,	 had	 an	 accident	 with	 the	 coffee	 machine.	 As	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>buttoned	with	one	hand,	I	powered	the	computer	and	waited	for	it	to	warm	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dinosaur	was	two	years	old,	plenty	of	time	to	get	out	my	yellow	pad	and	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">pens,	 and	 try	 not	 to	 stare	 at	 the	 wooden	 picture	 frame	 and	 the	 fading	 Polaroid, edges	 crumpled	 and	 black.	 But	 I	 didn’t	 need	 the	 photo	 to	 remember	 just	 how blue	the	Mad	River	had	been,	the	number	of	brown	trout	I	was	holding,	the	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 was	 smiling	 at	 Dad	 because	 there	 was	 never	 anyone	 else	 around	 to	 take	 the picture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 stupid	 kid.	 That	 stupid	 smile.	 I	 pushed	 the	 frame	 off	 the	 edge,	 right into	the	trashcan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	letting	things	get	to	me	so	I	took	a	deep	breath	and	leaned	back	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">chair,	 rubbed	 my	 temples	 to	 clear	 my	 head.	 It	 worked	 better	 than	 a	 slap	 in	 the face	and	so	much	quieter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	reached	into	the	brown	bag	I’d	gotten	from	the	cafeteria	and	pulled	out	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cherry-filled	 donut.	 It	 miraculously	 remained	 intact	 except	 for	 the	 blob	 of	 red oozing	down	the	side.	With	no	more	shirts,	I	threw	it	in	the	trash,	gave	the	frame some	company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	came	the	distant	drone	of	a	helicopter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Panic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	 most	 people	 the	 helicopter	 was	 no	 big	 deal,	 and	 maybe	 I	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">overreacting,	but	I	just	knew	they’d	found	my	escape.	The	escape	someone	else</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	tried	to	cover. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	helicopter	sounded	like	it	was	coming	from	the	front	of	the	building.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">hurried	down	the	hallway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grace,	Yung,	and	Trevor	had	their	offices	on	the	left	side	of	the	hall,	but	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 only	 interested	 in	 the	 ones	 facing	 the	 street.	 Wendell’s	 was	 first,	 the	 door closed,	 probably	 locked,	 a	 sad	 attempt	 at	 keeping	 the	 donut	 holes	 a	 secret. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sheila’s	office	was	next	to	his,	her	door	closed	as	well.	Always	locked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nathan,	Brightside’s	resident	artist,	had	the	office	before	the	bathrooms	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">emergency	stairwell.	His	door	was	wide	open.	He	never	closed	it,	said	he	didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	the	point	because	he	wanted	everyone	to	know	he	was	so	fucking	cool. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 bit	 of	 morning	 light	 coming	 through	 Nathan’s	 window	 let	 me	 see</p>
<p class="calibre1">without	 flipping	 the	 switch.	 I	 entered	 the	 office.	 Five	 miniature	 figures	 stood sentinel	around	the	room	and	watched	me	head	behind	Nathan’s	desk,	the	Exacto</p>
<p class="calibre1">knife	 right	 there,	 ready	 to	 create,	 remove.	 The	 figure	 sitting	 on	 the	 monitor looked	bored,	jealous	of	the	one	by	the	phone,	both	hands	on	his	ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 looked	 out	 the	 window	 and	 saw	 all	 of	 the	 Square,	 but	 no	 helicopter.	 It sounded	 further	 to	 the	 left	 so	 I	 hurried	 out	 of	 Nathan’s	 and	 turned	 down	 the south	 hallway.	 The	 noise	 was	 coming	 from	 straight	 ahead.	 Past	 the	 conference room	on	the	left,	Gloria	and	Edward’s	office	to	my	right.	It	was	loudest	behind</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>Carlos’s	door,	the	only	one	I	couldn’t	see	through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Entering	the	boss’s	office	was	never	a	good	idea,	but	I	did	it	anyway.	From</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 window,	 I	 could	 see	 the	 dull	 black	 helicopter	 was	 much	 further	 than	 I’d thought,	well	out	of	the	mounted	gun’s	shooting	range.	Where	it	was	flying	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	bothered	me.	Hovering	halfway	up	the	mountain	between	the	park	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">peak,	not	too	far	from	my	carvings,	real	close	to	the	cemetery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 closed	 Carlos’s	 door	 behind	 me,	 started	 for	 the	 elevator	 and	 tripped.	 If	 I hadn’t	 Demarius	 would	 have	 heard	 about	 my	 plan,	 not	 just	 me	 thinking	 about my	ankle.	Demarius	leaned	against	the	wall	to	my	office,	his	eyes	hidden	behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	sunglasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Demarius	was	first	to	speak.	“Damn,	son,	whatchu	rushing	for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	trying	to...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	crack	the	safe?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pointed	at	Carlos’s	office.	“Why	you	snooping?”	Demarius	took	a	step</p>
<p class="calibre1">away	from	the	wall,	his	usual	grin	nowhere	to	be	found.	He	called	me	over	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	finger.	“Let	me	holler	at	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	focused	on	my	ankle,	not	the	rocks	I’d	lifted	to	hide	the	cave.	“I’m	really</p>
<p class="calibre1">busy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,	 I	 just	 wanted	 to	 tell	 you	 I’m	 sorry.	 You	 know,	 for	 telling	 Sharon about	your	thoughts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh...no	 big	 deal.”	 I	 headed	 for	 my	 office,	 hopped	 so	 my	 ankle	 was	 all	 I could	think	of. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">You	one	skittish	motherfucker. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 threw	 myself	 into	 the	 chair.	 My	 mind	 back	 in	 the	 forest.	 The	 helicopter would	see	everything.	I	was	fucked.	Everything	fucked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	was	back	at	her	desk.	I	hadn’t	even	seen	her	on	the	way	in.	She	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">staring	at	me.	Her	eyes	looking	ready	to	pop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe,	you	need	to	stop.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	stop.”	I	knew	she’d	heard	every	thought,	but	I	couldn’t	control	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stood	and	grabbed	me	by	the	arm.	She	was	stronger	than	she	looked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Get.	Up</i>.	Thinking	like	a	drill	sergeant,	just	like	Dad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 had	 no	 choice	 and	 hopped	 on	 one	 foot,	 trying	 to	 save	 my	 ankle.	 Sara peeked	out	the	door,	checked	to	make	sure	the	coast	was	clear.	Then	she	dragged</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	out	of	our	office,	me	jumping	like	an	idiot.	We	made	it	to	the	stairwell.	There wasn’t	a	camera,	but	Sara	still	wouldn’t	open	her	lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a> <i class="calibre4">Are	you	fucking	crazy? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	our	chance	to—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	 smashed	 her	 hand	 over	 my	 mouth	 and	 thought,  <i class="calibre4">You’re	 going	 to	 get</i> <i class="calibre4">yourself	killed. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I	don’t	care. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Joe,	if	you	go	running	out	there,	trying	to	find	whatever	you	found,	they’re</i> <i class="calibre4">going	to	send	you	to	the	Cabin.	And	then	they’re	going	to	ask	who	else	knows. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">They’re	going	to	ask	Danny. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Danny	doesn’t	know. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">But	I	do. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hated	everything	coming	out	of	her	head,	but	she	was	right.	If	I	went	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">there,	 I’d	 never	 make	 it	 to	 the	 cave.	 Even	 if	 they	 didn’t	 know	 about	 the mineshaft,	I’d	lead	them	right	to	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	took	my	arm.	“Let’s	just	go	back	to	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 clicked	 my	 teeth,	 knowing	 it	 was	 my	 only	 option.	 I	 spent	 the	 rest	 of	 the day	 at	 my	 desk,	 trying	 not	 to	 think.	 I	 couldn’t	 help	 it	 though,	 which	 was	 why Sara	never	let	me	leave,	even	for	lunch.	I	stayed	tethered	to	that	computer,	away from	everyone	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 work,	 Sara	 invited	 me	 over	 for	 dinner	 with	 Danny.	 My	 mind	 on	 the helicopter.	There’d	been	no	reports	of	the	cave,	no	mention	of	anything,	except</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	a	few	new	Brightsiders	delivered	into	the	fold.	I	prayed	that	was	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	 popped	 up	 from	 the	 take-out	 we’d	 gotten,	 started	 spinning	 around, his	mouth	motorboating,	spit	flying	like	a	disgusting	sprinkler. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Danny,	sit	down,”	Sara	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	a	helicopter!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Danny,	go	wash	up.	NOW!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	kept	twirling	to	the	bathroom,	almost	toppling	over	into	the	kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	I	should	try	that.”	I	tapped	my	skull	and	said,	“Might	turn	off	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">stupid	thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	gave	a	sad	smile,	a	small	shake	of	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	felt	awful	and	said	I	was	sorry.	“And	thank	you	for	earlier.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 welcome.”	 Sara	 took	 a	 bite	 of	 her	 cold	 fries.	 “Although,	 you</p>
<p class="calibre1">would’ve	had	plenty	of	time	to	spin	in	the	Cabin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled,	but	my	mind	went	to	Rachel,	to	the	Boots	taking	her	away,	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">forest,	 the	 cave,	 the	 long,	 winding	 shaft,	 and	 that	 terrifying	 drop.	 Sara	 flinging over	the	ropes.	Both	of	us	rappelling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	looked	at	me,	her	eyes	hard	and	cold.	“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	we	could	get	out	of	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	I	told	you	no.	Now,	you	need	to	stop—” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>“Why?	 Don’t	 you	 want	 to	 be...”	 I	 trailed	 off,	 suddenly	 afraid	 there	 were cameras.	The	Council	said	they’d	had	them	all	removed	from	the	apartments,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	was	no	way	of	knowing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">We	can	be	free, </i>	I	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">And	if	we	get	caught? </i> Sara	shook	her	head.  <i class="calibre4">Then	everything	I’ve	done	to	be</i> <i class="calibre4">here	will	be	for	nothing. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 awkward	 tension	 physically	 hunched	 my	 back.	 Thankfully,	 Danny</p>
<p class="calibre1">broke	it	by	walking	in	with	toothpaste	caked	around	his	lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stood	and	said	my	goodbyes,	said	it	was	late.	Sara	walked	me	to	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Joe? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned,	saw	the	sadness	swirling	in	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I	care	about	you,	and	I	can’t	thank	you	enough	for	looking	after	Danny.	But</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">if	you’re	going	to	put	us	in	danger,	then	you	can’t	see	us	anymore. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">My	lip	started	to	split	between	my	teeth.	I	nodded	and	left	before	Sara	felt</p>
<p class="calibre1">sorry	for	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Staying	away	from	Sara	was	impossible.	Her	desk	was	eight	feet	away.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	might	as	well	have	been	a	mile.	She	focused	all	her	energy	into	her	calls,	and when	she	did	look	at	me,	she	only	told	herself	I	was	a	co-worker,	nothing	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	to	do	this	for	Danny,	because	she	knew	I’d	made	up	my	mind. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	ELEVEN</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">DAY	 100	 AND	 I’M	 ALONE	 in	 my	 office.	 I	 keep	 staring	 at	 Sara’s	 desk, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wondering	 when	 she’s	 going	 to	 get	 back.	 I	 need	 to	 talk	 sense	 into	 her.	 That’s what	I	was	trying	to	do	when	Carlos	came	in,	said	the	Council	needed	to	see	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	asked	for	what,	but	he	didn’t	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,	her	desk	is	empty,	except	for	the	single	red	rose,	which	isn’t	for	Sara. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	for	Rachel.	Alex,	the	little	kiss-ass	put	it	there	when	I	went	to	the	bathroom, just	to	let	me	know	he	wanted	her.	I’m	lucky	I	wasn’t	there	because	I	would’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">cracked,	 let	 him	 know	 the	 truth	 about	 Rachel.	 Alex	 with	 his	 short	 brown	 hair perfectly	 combed	 like	 an	 innocent	 schoolboy.	 Don’t	 worry	 about	 all	 those muscles,	the	smirk	that	said	anything	he	wanted	was	his.	Like	Rachel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poor	Alex	has	no	idea	it’s	never	going	to	happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	put	my	headphones	on,	trying	to	block	out	the	thoughts,	but	I	keep	falling</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	to	when	Rachel	re-entered	my	life.	The	biggest	mistake	she’d	ever	make. </p>
<p class="calibre1">BY	 DAY	 70	 I’D	 MADE	 up	 my	 mind,	 so	 I	 stayed	 away	 from	 Danny	 like	 Sara had	asked.	I	bought	an	audio	book,	“Learning	Spanish	1	and	2”	to	keep	my	mind</p>
<p class="calibre1">busy,	 keep	 me	 focused	 on	 something	 other	 than	 the	 mineshaft	 as	 I	 passed Brightsiders	in	the	Square	or	the	halls	of	work.	I	looked	like	a	weirdo,	repeating</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cuánto	cuesta	la	carne,”	“Me	encantaría	un	vaso	de	agua,”	and	“Puede	que	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">señale	el	bar	más	cercano?”	Weirdo	was	better	than	everyone	knowing	the	truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stayed	away	from	the	woods.	Had	no	idea	if	the	cave	had	been	discovered, </p>
<p class="calibre1">boarded	up,	filled	with	cement,	like	the	one	on	the	Eastern	edge,	but	I	couldn’t risk	going	up	there	to	look.	Not	right	away.	I	had	to	appear	like	everything	was normal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 work,	 I’d	 pull	 up	 maps	 of	 California	 to	 chart	 a	 course	 to	 Mexico, memorize	names	of	cities,	the	closest	airports,	the	distance	to	island	getaways.	I learned	 all	 I	 could	 about	 the	 best	 places	 to	 go	 and	 every	 time	 Carlos	 came around	he	was	thrilled	to	see	I	was	taking	my	job	seriously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	Brightside,	everyone	had	to	find	a	purpose,	a	reason	to	stay	alive.	That’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	Sharon	would	always	say.	And	Grace.	And	Phillip.	Carlos,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	I	definitely	had	my	purpose:	To	get	the	fuck	off	this	mountain. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>Every	night,	I’d	train.	Started	jogging.	Did	push-ups,	sit-ups.	Needed	to	get my	body	ready	for	long	trek	to	Mexico	and	beyond. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	even	practiced	the	hum	Dad	taught	me	to	clear	my	head.	I	realized	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	another	version	of	Sharon’s	mantra. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	 used	 to	 say,	 “Sometimes	 you	 have	 to	 make	 noise	 to	 make	 everything quiet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 hated	 him	 for	 what	 he’d	 done,	 for	 turning	 me	 in,	 but	 I	 finally	 had	 a purpose	here	in	Brightside	and	no	one,	especially	my	father,	was	going	to	screw</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	only	allowed	my	fantasies	of	beaches	and	bikinis	at	night,	holed	up	in	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">apartment	when	I	knew	everyone	was	asleep.	I	actually	felt	sorry	for	the	others, the	ones	who’d	never	breathe	free	air	again.	I	felt	awful	about	Sara,	too,	but	I’d given	her	a	chance.	She	just	refused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still,	 I	 knew	 she	 was	 right,	 that	 Danny	 wouldn’t	 survive	 on	 the	 outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	end	up	getting	us	caught.	He	was	better	off	here.	When	I	would	remember, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	 make	 him	 drawings.	 I’d	 been	 putting	 the	 good	 ones	 into	 a	 book	 and	 was planning	on	leaving	it	by	his	door	on	my	way	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	after	two	weeks,	on	Day	85,	I	decided	to	visit	the	cave.	Snuck	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 night.	 Looked	 like	 I	 was	 just	 taking	 a	 jog,	 my	 normal routine,	running	around	the	mountain	repeating,	“Gracias	por	el	bridis.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	wasn’t	a	soul	in	the	Square.	I	ran	a	few	laps	to	make	sure	then	took</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	 into	 the	 trees.	 Even	 the	 calm	 Spanish	 woman’s	 voice	 couldn’t	 tamp	 my anxiety.	My	heart	thumped	against	my	ribs	as	I	climbed	up	the	hill,	passing	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tree	with	Rachel	and	Michelle’s	names	scratched	out,	stepping	around	the	huge</p>
<p class="calibre1">tree	that	had	fallen	and	cracked	open	the	cave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	there	it	was.	Perfectly	untouched,	just	the	way	I	left	it,	every	stone	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">place.	 Not	 a	 single	 crack	 to	 see	 into	 the	 cave.	 Part	 of	 me	 wanted	 to	 rip	 them away,	just	take	off	down	the	shaft,	but	I	didn’t	have	my	supplies.	If	the	cave	had been	demolished,	I	didn’t	want	to	get	caught	with	rope,	bottles	of	water	and	cans of	soup.	I	ran	my	finger	along	one	of	the	rocks,	knowing	it	wouldn’t	be	long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Day	86	would	be	my	last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	morning	I	tried	to	stay	vigilant,	focused,	but	the	excitement	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything	 fizz.	 I	 felt	 like	 a	 kid	 going	 to	 school	 on	 his	 birthday,	 waiting, watching	the	clock,	needing	it	to	move	faster	so	I	could	go	home.	Only	this	time home	was	everywhere.	Anywhere	but	Brightside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	put	on	my	headphones	and	opened	the	door.	“War	Inside	My	Head”	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">playing,	just	the	right	song	for	the	number	of	people	on	the	sidewalks,	everyone heading	to	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	cranked	the	iPod	as	loud	as	it	went	and	kept	walking,	not	worried	about</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a><img src="index-104_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="index-104_2.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">someone	stopping	me.	A	question	not	heard,	a	question	not	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	music	shut	everything	out.	Dad	used	to	hate	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 WAS	 THIRTEEN	 AND	 we	 were	 in	 the	 car	 when	 Dad	 ripped	 off	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">headphones	and	chucked	them	into	the	back	seat.	“You	think	I	want	to	listen	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	crap?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	crap.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	going	to	blow	out	your	ears.	And	mine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	forgot	he	could	hear	my	quiet	rage,	the	screaming,	blasting	thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 blew	 out	 a	 long	 breath	 of	 decaf	 and	 was	 much	 calmer	 when	 he	 said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	really	think	you	need	to	listen	to	that	stuff?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hit	Stop	so	I	didn’t	waste	the	batteries.	“I	like	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	grabbed	my	Walkman,	slid	out	the	tape,	held	it	up	so	he	could	read	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Fear	is	the	Mindkiller</i>.	Funny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 wasn’t	 funny.	 It	 was	 power.	 It	 blocked	 out	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 world.	 Three men	 punishing	 their	 instruments,	 their	 fans,	 themselves.	 Saying	 the	 stuff	 I wanted	to,	but	didn’t	know	how.	I	didn’t	bother	telling	Dad	any	of	that	because</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	wouldn’t	get	it.	I	held	out	my	hand	and	said,	“Maybe	I	like	noise.	Maybe	it’s better	than	most	of	the	crap	I	hear	in	your	head.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	took	the	tape,	dropped	it	into	his	shirt	pocket.	“Real	nice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sounded	like	a	baby	when	I	told	him	to	give	it	to	me,	said	it	was	mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	pulled	the	tape	out	and	looked	at	me	like	he	wanted	to	know	the	truth, </p>
<p class="calibre1">not	what	I	thought	he	wanted	me	to	say.	“Let	me	ask	you	something,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	do	know	what	people	think	of	other	people	who	listen	to	this	music?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 couldn’t	 lie.	 Not	 when	 Dad	 looked	 at	 me	 like	 that.	 I	 said,	 “People	 are gonna	think	what	they’re	gonna	think.	I’d	rather	not	hear	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	shook	his	head.	“Who	cares	what	others	think	of	you.	Let	them	think</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	they	want.	That’s	your	answer?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	handed	me	the	tape	and	headed	down	the	street.	“You’re	a	better	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	I	was.	I	never	would’ve	turned	someone	in,	especially	my	own	son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">DAY	 86.	 I	 TRIED	 TO	 keep	 busy	 at	 work.	 Made	 calls.	 I	 even	 sounded</p>
<p class="calibre1">enthusiastic	for	the	first	time,	because	I	wasn’t	selling	the	customer.	I	was	selling myself.	On	the	island	bungalows,	the	desert	resorts.	But	time	wasn’t	moving	fast</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>enough.	I	kept	thinking	it	was	time	for	lunch,	halfway	there,	but	it	wasn’t	even ten.	I	decided	to	get	something	to	drink,	headed	for	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	said,	“Joe...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	fine.”	I	put	on	my	headphones.	“See?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	break	room	was	to	my	right,	a	good	chance	it	was	empty.	This	wasn’t	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">place	where	people	hung	out	by	the	water	cooler	so	I	opened	the	door,	stepped</p>
<p class="calibre1">inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carlos	finished	digging	in	the	fridge	and	headed	toward	me,	a	water	bottle</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 each	 hand.	 He	 was	 talking	 so	 I	 had	 to	 take	 off	 my	 headphones	 and	 ask	 him what	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	been	going	over	numbers	with	Sara.	I	think	we	can	crack	Canada.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cool.”	I	pictured	myself	walking	the	streets	of	Montreal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carlos	cocked	his	eyebrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quickly,	I	said,	“I	can	put	together	a	list	of	territories.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	over	to	the	cupboard,	tempted	to	grab	the	dusty	can	of	regular	coffee, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	I	started	a	fresh	batch	of	decaf.	The	last	thing	I	needed	was	having	my	mind race.	There	was	just	no	telling	how	far	it	would	go,	what	I’d	give	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carlos	asked	when	I	could	have	it	ready. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“End	of	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thankfully,	he	left.	I	felt	bad	for	Sara,	knowing	she	had	to	sit	in	his	office</p>
<p class="calibre1">every	 day	 listening	 to	 Carlos	 wearing	 out	 the	 word	 “Great!”	 and	 yet	 somehow keeping	my	secret. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 poured	 my	 cup,	 walked	 out,	 and	 nearly	 spilled	 it	 at	 the	 sight	 of	 Rachel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 hair	 was	 dried	 out	 and	 frizzy.	 She	 wore	 this	 baggy	 wool	 sweater	 that reminded	 me	 of	 my	 grandmother’s	 before	 she	 was	 sent	 to	 the	 psych	 ward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel’s	eyes	were	wide	and	jittery	like	she’d	been	electrocuted.	Her	skin	pale, almost	gray. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those	wide	eyes	grew	even	wider	when	she	saw	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	hurried	over	and	threw	her	arms	around	me.	More	life	than	when	I	saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	in	the	Cabin,	but	still	not	Rachel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you	for	visiting	me.	The	nurse	said	you	were	really	sweet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh...”	I	noticed	everyone	in	the	office	coming	to	gawk	at	the	girl	formerly</p>
<p class="calibre1">known	as	Rachel.	This	shattered	creature	standing	there	in	that	disgusting	wool</p>
<p class="calibre1">sweater.	I	brought	her	to	my	office,	the	one	that	used	to	be	hers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 a	 mistake.	 Rachel	 started	 crying,	 sobbing,	 then	 suddenly	 pulled	 it together	because	she	knew	people	were	still	watching. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a><img src="index-106_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	you	give	us	a	second,	Sara?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	said	sure	thing	and	closed	the	door	behind	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	just	stood	there	staring	at	her	old	desk.	She	wasn’t	blinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	asked	her,	“When	did	you	get	out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um...this	morning.	Yeah...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	that’s	great.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 stood	 there	 for	 a	 few	 seconds.	 I	 couldn’t	 believe	 how	 old	 she	 looked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	messed	with	her	hair.	“I’m	getting	a	new	apartment.	They’re	painting	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	so	I	haven’t	had	a	chance	to	shower.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	look	great.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	knew	I	was	lying,	but	she	appreciated	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,”	she	said,	“I	was	thinking	maybe	we	could	have	dinner	tonight?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tonight?”	I	pushed	the	thought	of	the	cave	out	of	my	head.	“I’m	buried	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">work.	I	don’t	really	know	how	long...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 tears	 spread	 across	 her	 eyes	 again.	 She	 had	 the	 image	 of	 the	 cave rattling	around	her	damaged	brain.	It	confused	her.	She	shook	her	head	like	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	mad	at	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Screw	work,”	I	said.	“Dinner	sounds	perfect.	Where	do	you	want	to	go?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	thinking	Oscar’s.	You	know,	like	old	times.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oscar’s	it	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	smiled	and	it	looked	like	it	hurt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	let	me	get	back	to	work.	I’ll	meet	you	at	eight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sounded	a	little	more	like	her	old	self	when	she	said,	“Okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	couldn’t	have	her	near	anymore.	As	calmly	as	I	could,	I	opened	the	door</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	smiled,	told	her,	“I’ll	see	you	tonight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	leaned	in	and	put	those	dry,	cracking	lips	on	mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	came	back	in	after	being	subjected	to	Rachel’s	scowl.	I	couldn’t	look</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	Sara,	not	with	what	was	going	through	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 was	 telling	 me	 to	 look	 at	 Rachel,	 to	 really	 take	 a	 good	 look,	 because that’s	how	I	was	going	to	end	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	SHOULDN’T	HAVE	GONE	out	with	Rachel	that	night.	I	should’ve	just	blown</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	off	and	made	my	escape.	But	Rachel	deserved	better	than	that.	I	wasn’t	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	 reason	 she	 got	 sent	 to	 the	 Cabin,	 but	 I	 could’ve	 stopped	 it.	 Could’ve	 told her	what	she	needed	to	hear.	I	knew	the	Boots	were	coming	and	I	just	sat	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	a	coward.	If	I	didn’t	have	the	balls	to	face	Rachel	and	tell	her	how	sorry	I was,	how	would	I	ever	step	off	the	two	hundred	foot	drop,	stay	one	step	ahead	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>the	dogs	and	the	bullets? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Plus,	 I	 needed	 an	 alibi.	 I	 wanted	 everyone	 to	 see	 me	 out	 on	 a	 date.	 My weird	 late	 night	 jogs	 were	 causing	 people	 to	 talk.	 Some	 thought	 I	 was overcompensating,	trying	not	to	lose	it.	Others	thought	I	already	had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	was	waiting	for	me	on	the	bench	under	the	flapping	American	flag, </p>
<p class="calibre1">just	like	Night	38,	only	this	time	she	wasn’t	in	her	fancy	green	dress.	She	wore	a long	skirt,	a	big	puffy	coat.	When	she	saw	me	she	wished	she’d	worn	something</p>
<p class="calibre1">nicer.	I	was	in	the	only	suit	I	had	in	Brightside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	look	nice,”	Rachel	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	fidgeted	in	her	coat,	looked	down	at	her	big,	ugly	snow	boots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,	let’s	eat,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hadn’t	meant	to	take	her	hand,	but	there	it	was.	Rachel	blushed,	she	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">hope	we	might	actually	work	out.	I	hummed	in	my	head	to	keep	out	the	truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	song	is	that?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	something	my	dad	used	to	sing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	heard	what	I	wanted	to	do	to	him	for	turning	me	in,	but	she	didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">say	anything,	just	rubbed	my	arm	as	we	walked	through	the	Square.	It	felt	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	sat	in	the	back,	even	though	the	hostess	wanted	us	up	front	to	make	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">seem	not	so	empty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	never	seen	it	like	this,”	Rachel	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 hostess	 told	 us	 that	 they’d	 been	 bringing	 in	 so	 many	 new	 people</p>
<p class="calibre1">everyone’s	 wages	 had	 been	 cut.	 I	 worked	 on	 commission	 so	 I	 hadn’t	 thought about	it	before.	But	it	made	sense.	There	was	only	so	much	money	to	be	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	a	mountaintop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	looked	over	the	menu,	but	I	knew	what	she	was	going	to	ask	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	even	said	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 wanted	 to	 sound	 normal,	 not	 broken	 inside,	 the	 girl	 trapped	 in	 the Cabin,	swallowing	pills	to	sedate	her	mind.	“Tell	me	about	Sara.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	 Danny’s	 sister.	 She	 came	 here	 to	 be	 with	 him.	 Actually	 turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	like	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	just	friends.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	studied	me,	her	eyes	peering	over	the	menu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing	happened.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	ducked	down	behind	her	menu.	“I	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	 easy	 it	 was	 to	 remember	 all	 the	 reasons	 Rachel	 and	 I	 should	 never have	been	together	in	the	first	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	took	a	drink,	steeled	herself.	“Okay,	I	just	want	you	to	listen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>I	 pulled	 on	 my	 sleeves,	 wished	 I’d	 worn	 something	 more	 comfortable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alright.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	need	to	apologize,”	she	said.	“For	what	happened.	For	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I’m	the	one	who—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	said	listen.	Just...listen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	okay.	Sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 thought	 about	 you	 a	 lot.	 I	 mean,	 when	 I	 could	 think.	 And	 I	 understand that	I	have	way	too	much	stuff	going	on	inside.	And	I	know	you	didn’t	always</p>
<p class="calibre1">find	me	attractive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rachel...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	it’s	okay.	I’m	not	perfect.	And	I	didn’t	want	to	accept	that.	It’s	why	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">did	a	lot	of	the	stuff	in	the	past.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	list	of	men	spinning	in	my	head	like	a	Rolodex. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And...you	 have	 a	 lot	 of	 stuff,	 too,	 which	 is	 okay.	 We	 have	 this	 thing, whatever	it	is,	and	it	makes	life	so	much	more	complicated.	Sometimes	we	feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">hurt	 because	 we	 know	 what	 other	 people	 are	 thinking.	 Other	 times	 we	 feel superior	because	no	one	can	ever	lie	to	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cave	flashed	in	my	mind	before	I	could	catch	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe,	what’s	going	on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing.	Keep	going.”	I	thought	loud	and	clear,  <i class="calibre4">I	want	to	hear	about	the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Cabin. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">She	focused	and	said,	“It	was	really	hard	at	first.	Like	you	were	strapped	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">something,	only	you	didn’t	really	care.	But	it	taught	me	things.	To	be	accepting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Open.	To	realize	that	Brightside	offers	us	a	place	to	be	with	our	own	kind.	In	the real	 world,	 relationships	 are	 always	 one-sided	 with	 us.	 Here,	 for	 the	 first	 time, we’re	on	equal	footing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon’s	 words	 spewing	 out	 of	 her	 mouth.	 I	 focused	 on	 the	 fork,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">starting	 lineup	 for	 the	 Cleveland	 Indians.	 It	 was	 teenage	 sex.	 Thinking	 of anything	to	push	it	back,	delay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe,	I	need	you	to	hear	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jim	Thome	on	first	base. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">JOE! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	rushed	things	and	that’s	my	fault.	We	really	don’t	know	each	other,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	like	to	try.	I	mean,	we	have	all	the	time	in	the	world.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Time.	In	five	hours	I	was	supposed	to	be	tying	the	rope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel’s	first	thought	was	I	was	going	to	hang	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	been	drawing,”	I	blurted.	“Like	a	lot.	For	Danny.	And	I	think	I’m,	uh, </p>
<p class="calibre1">getting	pretty	good.	Even	faces,	which	are	impossible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a>Rachel	 thought	 about	 my	 first	 drawing,	 the	 one	 of	 her	 under	 the	 tree.	 Her nose	so	Jewish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	waitress	arrived	and	I	took	a	breath,	happy	to	have	something	new	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">focus	on.	But	when	the	waitress	left,	the	thoughts	started	coming	in	waves.	I	ate breadsticks.	Savored	every	 bite.	Focused	on	 the	crunch,	the	 crumbs	melting	on my	 tongue.	 I’d	 never	 taken	 such	 pleasure	 in	 a	 breadstick,	 never	 focused	 my entire	being	on	a	bite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly,	Rachel’s	foot	was	rubbing	against	mine.	She’d	taken	it	out	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">boot.	I	felt	her	stockings	sliding	up	my	pant	leg.	Nylon	on	flesh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	slowly	took	a	bite	of	her	breadstick,	like	she	was	going	to	make	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">explode	in	her	mouth.	It	was	weird	and	a	little	sexy.	Sexy	was	just	fine.	Meant	I didn’t	 have	 to	 think	 about	 the	 cave,	 my	 escape.	 I	 put	 my	 hand	 on	 her	 foot, brought	it	up	between	my	legs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	waitress	came	back,	pretended	like	she	forgot	something	and	left.	Her</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughts	calling	out:	 <i class="calibre4">Why	do	the	perverts	always	sit	in	my	section? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 some	 point	 during	 dinner	 it	 started	 to	 sleet,	 and	 by	 the	 time	 we	 hit	 the sidewalk,	 we	 could	 barely	 keep	 our	 balance,	 the	 wind	 howling	 in	 the	 night.	 I wasn’t	 drunk,	 but	 I’d	 had	 a	 glass	 of	 wine	 at	 Rachel’s	 insistence.	 I	 figured	 it’d give	 me	 courage	 for	 the	 long	 night	 ahead.	 But	 with	 the	 ground	 covered	 in	 ice, my	 escape	 would	 have	 to	 wait.	 Climbing	 down	 a	 dry	 rope	 was	 treacherous enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe,	what	are	you	thinking?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Shit. </i>	“We	should	get	inside.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	wind	was	so	loud	I	couldn’t	hear	Rachel’s	thoughts.	Prayed	she	hadn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard	mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sex	was	odd.	First,	we’re	tearing	off	each	other’s	clothes,	the	next,	I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">underneath	her	and	Sara	pops	into	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	touched	my	cheek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sorry,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	nothing	to	be	sorry	about.	It’s	natural.	Let’s	just	focus	on	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Cabin	had	broken	the	old	Rachel,	left	this	kind-hearted	creature	behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wondered	if	some	time	in	the	Cabin	was	just	what	I	needed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	between	licks	on	my	chest,	Rachel	said,	“You.	Really.	Don’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Afterwards	we	stretched	out,	caught	our	breath.	Then	Rachel	got	up	to	pee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	steps	later	she	cried	out.	“What	the	hell’s	all	over	the	floor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	 navigated	 through	 the	 jagged	 pieces	 of	 broken	 gifts	 I	 hadn’t	 fully swept.	The	pieces	to	Dad’s	puzzle.	I	thought	Rachel	was	out	of	range,	but	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	came	back,	her	body	haloed	by	the	bathroom	light,	she	said,	“I	want	to	see</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rachel,	I	don’t	think—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	you	do.	You	want	to	show	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fucking	telepaths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 got	 up,	 threw	 on	 some	 underwear	 because	 my	 dick	 had	 shriveled	 like	 a snail,	 and	 there’s	 something	 not	 right	 about	 holding	 a	 shotgun	 buck	 naked.	 I stepped	into	the	closet,	reached	up	to	the	top	shelf,	where	it	was	hidden	behind	a bunch	of	Dad’s	boxes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	shiny	and	ready	for	action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	I	hold	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	there	weren’t	any	cameras	in	my	room.	The	Boots	would	have	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	night	I’d	assembled	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be	careful.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 heavy.”	 Rachel	 pretended	 like	 she	 was	 going	 to	 drop	 it,	 but	 caught	 it and	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	mess	around.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?	Scared?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	pointed	the	gun	at	my	chest.	I	couldn’t	remember	if	I’d	taken	out	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shells. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	not	funny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kinda	is.”	She	aimed	at	my	dick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	kind-hearted,	so	fucking	crazy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	give	it	to	me,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	backed	me	up	and	I	fell	onto	the	bed.	She	grinned	like	a	child	who’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">found	her	Christmas	presents.	“Tell	me	about	the	mine,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Rachel,	shut	up. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Tell	me	about	the	cave. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	knew	I	wasn’t	going	to	say	shit,	not	with	her	pointing	the	shotgun	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">me,	so	she	handed	it	over.	I	thought	about	hitting	her	with	it	like	a	baseball	bat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	this	little	girl	voice,	she	said,	“Please	don’t	hit	me,	Mister.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	tension	broke	into	laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Truth	was	I	wanted	to	tell	her.	Sara	was	the	only	person	who	knew	and	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	 it	 was	 the	 dumbest	 thing	 that	 had	 ever	 clanged	 around	 my	 head.	 So	 I silently	told	Rachel	everything.	How	I’d	found	it,	traveled	down	the	shaft	in	the dark,	seen	the	drop-off,	covered	it	back	up	with	rocks.	We	both	figured	the	Boots and	 the	 Council	 never	 knew	 it	 was	 even	 there,	 it’d	 probably	 been	 covered	 up before	we	arrived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	 sat	 next	 to	 me,	 and	 I	 realized	 I	 wanted	 her	 to	 come	 along.	 Didn’t want	to	do	it	alone.	I	needed	someone	to	help	me	down	the	two	hundred	feet	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>Rachel	used	to	rock	climb.	Before	I	could	even	ask,	Rachel	said:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a><img src="index-112_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	TWELVE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">OUR	 ACCELERATED	 RELATIONSHIP	 took	 off	 again.	 Rachel	 and	 I	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">already	 gone	 in	 our	 heads,	 already	 free,	 lying	 on	 some	 beach,	 our	 sweat glistening	 in	 the	 sun.	 But	 she	 had	 to	 meet	 with	 Sharon	 every	 day.	 Had	 a	 daily check-in	 to	 make	 sure	 she	 was	 still	 on	 the	 mend.	 I	 worried	 Rachel	 would	 slip, our	 plans	 landing	 right	 in	 Sharon’s	 head.	 We’d	 both	 end	 up	 in	 the	 Cabin,	 this time	forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 don’t	 have	 to	 worry,”	 Rachel	 said.	 “Listen.”	 She	 closed	 her	 eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	am	I	thinking?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	zeroed	in,	but	heard	nothing.	No	mantra,	no	hum,	just	silence,	like	Danny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	too	far,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	pressed	herself	against	me.	I	listened.	Still	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stepped	back,	curtseyed.	“I	learned	it	in	the	Cabin.	That’s	why	they	let</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	out.	Nothing	but	a	blank	slate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something	about	the	pills.	I	can	just	shut	it	off	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	back	to	the	howling	wind	outside	Oscar’s,	how	I	couldn’t	hear	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughts,	but	it	wasn’t	the	noise.	She	just	wasn’t	letting	me	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	asked	if	she	could	get	me	some	of	the	pills	to	see	if	they	might	work	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">me.	 She	 said	 she’d	 try,	 but	 it	 probably	 wouldn’t	 happen.	 The	 medicine	 was locked	up	in	the	Cabin.	Always	a	guard	posted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	focused	on	the	plan,	focused	on	training.	Rachel	said	if	I	was	going	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	this	I	had	to	get	more	comfortable	with	heights.	We	started	with	a	few	thirty-foot	drops	near	the	pond.	Then	we	moved	on	to	her	building,	had	me	lean	out	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">window	 on	 the	 fifth	 floor.	 When	 a	 Brightsider	 passed	 underneath,	 I	 sprayed Windex	on	the	window,	pretended	to	clean.	All	of	it	made	my	heart	feel	like	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 going	 to	 pop.	 My	 lungs	 closed.	 Everything	 tunneled.	 But	 I	 had	 to	 keep pressing,	pushing	myself	higher. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	Day	99,	I	was	ready	for	a	rooftop.	My	office	stood	seven	stories	high. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	final	test	before	our	escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 woke	 early,	 already	 sweating,	 picturing	 the	 fall,	 my	 face	 splattering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	asked	if	I	was	afraid	of	falling	or	landing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	the	difference?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	said,	“Landing	means	you	don’t	want	to	die.	Falling	means	you’re	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>pussy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	answer,	but	we	both	knew	which	category	I	fit	into. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	 asked	 if	 I	 wanted	 her	 to	 go	 up	 there	 with	 me	 for	 moral	 support.	 I told	her	no,	this	was	something	I	had	to	do	alone.	Plus,	rooftops	were	completely off-limits	to	anyone	not	in	maintenance,	which	was	why	after	Rachel	left	for	her meeting	with	Sharon,	I	had	to	see	Danny,	even	though	Sara	warned	me	if	I	ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	 around,	 she’d	 turn	 me	 in,	 tell	 Sharon,	 the	 Council,	 anyone	 who	 would listen.	She’d	tell	them	I’d	found	a	way	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	was	technically	a	janitor,	but	all	the	maintenance	men	wore	the	same</p>
<p class="calibre1">uniform.	I	watched	from	down	below,	hiding	behind	a	tree,	hiding	from	the	rain, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 Sara	 handed	 Danny	 his	 lunch.	 He’d	 done	 the	 buttons	 wrong	 again	 on	 his coveralls	and	Sara	quickly	fixed	them.	They	came	out	of	their	building.	Danny</p>
<p class="calibre1">waved	that	pencil-clenched	fist	at	her	and	headed	to	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	cut	him	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	Danny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	you	been,	Joe?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,	I’ve	been	busy.	But	I	brought	you	something.”	I	pulled	out	another</p>
<p class="calibre1">drawing.	Billy	Bass,	Danny,	and	Sara	singing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing	how	excited	Danny	was	almost	made	me	smile.	“You	like	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	sounded	like	he	was	going	to	burst.	“Best	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,	 that’s	 good,”	 I	 said.	 “Now,	 I	 was	 wondering	 if	 I	 could	 ask	 you	 a favor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anything,	Joe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	need	one	of	your	uniforms.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	too	big.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doesn’t	matter.	It’s	for	a...game.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	I	play?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eventually,	but	I’m	still	working	out	the	rules.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny’s	eyes	got	all	wide	and	weird.	I	was	trying	to	control	my	thoughts, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	something	slipped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	are	you	going	to	the	roof,	Joe?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 pulled	 him	 close,	 whispered,	 “I’m	 trying	 to	 challenge	 myself.	 Some</p>
<p class="calibre1">personal	improvement.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	your	jogging?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	like	that.	Now	can	you	help	me	out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	 thought	 about	 it	 for	 a	 second,	 pictured	 his	 boss,	 Larry,	 yelling	 at him,	but	when	he	looked	down	at	the	drawing,	his	head	started	bobbing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a><img src="index-114_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	started	taking	off	his	coveralls	right	there	in	the	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	no,	one	of	your	spares.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 said	 okay	 and	 we	 walked	 back	 to	 his	 place.	 My	 drawings	 covered	 the walls.	He’d	kept	every	one,	tacked	them	up	like	a	museum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	went	to	the	closet,	pulled	out	his	spare	uniform.	He	started	to	give	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 me,	 but	 pulled	 it	 back.	 He	 was	 thinking	 about	 how	 I’d	 been	 avoiding	 him, angry	at	me	for	being	such	a	crappy	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	told	him	I’d	make	it	up	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	we	have	a	party?”	Danny	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	your	favorite	cake?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,	whatever	you	like.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	handed	me	the	uniform.	“No,	what	you	like.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	Angel	Food.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	spongy,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	it’s	spongy.		But	now	I	have	to	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	sounded	pretty	sad	when	he	said,	“Okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	got	to	the	door	and	Danny	stared	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Be	safe,	Joe. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	told	him	I	would. </p>
<p class="calibre1">BREAK	 WAS	 TO	 BE	 TAKEN	 at	 ten	 o’clock,	 but	 it	 had	 stopped	 raining	 and	 I didn’t	 want	 to	 risk	 waiting	 another	 twenty	 minutes.	 Sara	 was	 meeting	 with Carlos.	I	couldn’t	let	her	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	stairwell	was	silent,	not	a	noise	above	or	below.	It	was	for	emergencies</p>
<p class="calibre1">only,	definitely	not	breaks,	something	Carlos	loved	reminding	everyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	peeked	over	the	railing,	made	sure	I	was	alone,	then	headed	up	the	stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 a	 padlock	 on	 the	 roof	 access	 door,	 but	 I’d	 also	 borrowed	 one	 of Danny’s	keys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quickly,	 I	 slipped	 on	 Danny’s	 spare	 coveralls	 and	 matching	 hat,	 both	 two sizes	too	small. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Council	had	ruled	the	roof	off-limits	after	Paul’s	plunge.	It	was	stupid</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 argue	 something	 could	 be	 completely	 fine	 one	 day,	 a	 liability	 the	 next.	 The roof	was	a	roof.	It	wasn’t	safe	or	unsafe.	It	just	was.	Just	like	a	rope.	A	knife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Puddles	 covered	 the	 rooftop.	 It’d	 been	 warmer	 these	 last	 few	 days.	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wondered	if	it’d	stay	this	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>I	told	myself	to	stop	thinking,	time	was	running	out.	I	needed	to	get	back	to my	desk.	There	was	a	folding	chair	leaning	against	the	wall	where	they	kept	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">air	 conditioners.	 I	 took	 my	 first	 step,	 and	 even	 though	 I	 was	 nowhere	 near	 the ledge,	I	was	already	soaking	Danny’s	coveralls	with	my	sweat. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Baby	steps. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	moved	over	to	the	folding	chair.	Stepping	up,	even	against	the	wall,	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	dizzy.	I	looked	out	at	the	mountains	toward	the	cemetery,	couldn’t	see	a	thing with	the	sun	peeking	over	the	top,	my	eyes	useless	without	my	sunglasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	wasn’t	a	great	feeling	knowing	the	Rangers	could	see	me,	but	not	so	bad</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	be	a	good	little	citizen	and	go	back	downstairs.	I	needed	to	do	this.	I	kept	my hand	 on	 the	 wall	 at	 first	 then	 slowly	 peeled	 it	 away,	 just	 me	 standing	 on	 the chair,	high	above	it	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	wasn’t	enough.	I	didn’t	come	here	for	the	view	so	I	got	down,	moved	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">chair	a	bit	further.	Closer	to	the	tiny	concrete	ledge	that	spanned	the	front	of	the building.	Closer	to	the	ledge	Paul	said	he	tripped	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	I	couldn’t	beat	my	fear	of	heights,	Day	100	would	become	200	then	300. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	never	leave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	focused	on	the	piece	of	duct	tape	on	the	pipe	eight	feet	from	the	ledge.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wiped	my	hand	on	my	pants.	As	brave	as	I	could,	I	took	the	chair	across	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">strip	of	silver.	My	next	goal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	like	to	say	it	was	easy,	that	I	walked	right	up	to	that	line	and	put	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	chair,	but	that’d	be	a	lie.	It	took	a	minute,	maybe	two,	to	get	the	chair	there, only	a	second	to	sit	my	ass	down,	get	closer	to	the	solid	roof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	map	Rachel	had	made	crinkled	in	my	back	pocket.	I	took	it	out,	held	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">tight	as	a	gust	of	wind	blew	across	the	roof.	I	opened	the	map,	looked	at	it	until my	 heart	 stopped	 thumping,	 until	 I	 knew	 every	 line,	 could	 see	 every	 squiggle<b class="calibre3">. </b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	road	within	five	miles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	folded	the	paper	in	half	two	times.	Then	I	ripped	it	again	and	again	until</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	was	no	piece	bigger	than	a	stamp.	I	threw	my	hand	in	the	air,	let	the	wind carry	most	of	the	pieces	away,	the	rest	floating	down	onto	the	roof,	soaking	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 was	 doing	 pretty	 good	 right	 then,	 didn’t	 feel	 nervous	 at	 all.	 Without	 a second	thought,	I	scooped	up	the	chair	and	duck-walked	two	feet,	stopped	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">six	from	the	ledge.	My	safe	spot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	move	didn’t	do	much	to	me,	I	was	doing	okay,	my	breaths	still	rapid, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	not	out	of	control.	Still,	I	had	to	go	all	the	way.	Today	wasn’t	the	day	to	do anything	half-ass.	Not	when	it	could	mean	getting	my	head	blown	off	because	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t	climb	out	of	the	mineshaft. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wasn’t	scared.	My	father’s	voice	in	my	head,  <i class="calibre4">Be	a	man! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a>The	 ledge	 was	 right	 there,	 close	 enough	 to	 touch.	 The	 building	 was	 less than	a	year	old,	but	the	foot-high	hunk	of	concrete	looked	like	it’d	been	slapped on	as	an	afterthought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	told	myself	not	to	freak	out,	that	I	was	fine.	Nothing	was	going	to	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">along	and	push	me	off	the	chair,	send	me	over	the	ledge.	I	was	safe.	I	was	doing it.	I	was	being	a	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow	I	got	my	right	foot	on	the	ledge,	pressed	on	it	a	little	to	check	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	give.	I	didn’t	feel	any. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	to	the	sky,	figured	this	should	be	the	part	I	got	rained	on.	Maybe	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">thunderstorm,	 the	 world’s	 biggest	 flashflood,	 something	 to	 come	 and	 fling	 me off	the	roof,	sending	me	to	oblivion	or	a	fancy	wheelchair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	long	time	ago,	I	learned	God	doesn’t	answer	prayers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 I	 wanted	 something	 done,	 I	 was	 going	 to	 have	 to	 do	 it.	 Before	 I	 could chicken	 out,	 I	 reached	 forward,	 put	 my	 hand	 on	 the	 ledge,	 the	 wet	 concrete,	 a rough	slickness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 heart	 was	 thumping	 like	 I’d	 run	 a	 mile,	 but	 I	 was	 holding	 onto	 the ledge.	I	straightened	my	legs,	got	my	ass	out	of	the	chair.	I	took	a	step	closer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	shivering,	clutching	that	ledge	like	it	was	the	only	thing	stopping	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 going	 over.	 Scared	 shitless	 like	 a	 little	 kid.	 Scared	 of	 the	 American	 flag, snapping	in	the	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	 day	 since	 my	 first	 one,	 I’d	 given	 myself	 two	 options;	 leave</p>
<p class="calibre1">Brightside	or	else.	But	I	couldn’t	do	either	one	stuck	on	my	knees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	squeezed	the	ledge	tighter,	holding	my	breath	without	even	knowing	it.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">blew	 out	 and	 took	 three	 quick	 ones,	 made	 my	 heart	 slow	 down.	 I	 was	 twenty-eight	 years	 old.	 I	 could	 let	 go	 of	 the	 ledge.	 I	 could	 lean	 over	 and	 look	 down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Look	down	eighty	feet,	the	wet	sidewalk	below,	the	exact	spot	Paul	landed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 wind	 kept	 on	 coming,	 the	 red,	 white,	 and	 blue	 firing	  <i class="calibre4">whack,	 whack,</i> <i class="calibre4">whack</i>.	 I	 was	 getting	 up.	 One	 way	 or	 another,	 I	 was	 getting	 on	 that	 ledge.	 If	 I couldn’t,	I	couldn’t	do	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	kept	both	hands	on	the	concrete,	my	eyes	on	the	flag,	forced	one	foot	up.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought	my	other	foot	underneath	me,	had	both	on	the	ledge.	I	put	my	hand	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	chest,	felt	my	heart	trying	to	break	through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	no	one	around	that	could	hear	me,	but	I	said,	“I	pledge	allegiance</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 flag	 of	 the	 United	 States	 of	 America.	 And	 to	 the	 Republic	 for	 which	 it stands.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	I	was.	I	was	standing	so	high	above	it	all! </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 squinted	 my	 eyes	 as	 the	 wind	 whipped	 at	 my	 face.	 “One	 nation.	 Under God.	Indivisible.	With	liberty	and	justice	for	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	somewhere	in	my	head,	my	father’s	voice,  <i class="calibre4">Do	it! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>I’m	 not	 sure	 what	 happened,	 but	 I	 wasn’t	 scared.	 Of	 Dad.	 Of	 falling.	 Of anything.	Dad	couldn’t	hear	me,	but	I	said,	“Sorry.	Not	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	I	heard	Mom’s	voice,  <i class="calibre4">Come	on,	Superman.	Let’s	see	you	fly. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	flipped	them	off	with	both	hands,	middle	fingers	to	them	and	the	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fuck	them.	Fuck	Brightside.	I	was	tired	of	getting	picked	on,	told	what	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do.	I’d	stand	on	the	ledge	all	goddamn	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	Brightsiders	took	notice	from	across	the	Square. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 remained	 perfectly	 still,	 wondered	 who	 else	 was	 watching	 me	 openly</p>
<p class="calibre1">oppose	a	Council	sanction.	The	seconds	ticked	and	the	wind	whipped,	threatened</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 tip	 me	 over	 the	 edge.	 The	 longer	 I	 stood,	 the	 more	 ridiculous	 it	 got.	 I	 was being	childish	and	irresponsible.	I	had	a	job	to	get	back	to,	at	least	for	a	while, and	I	had	the	plan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	all	of	a	sudden	a	woman	shrieked	from	behind.	“Joe!	Don’t!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 turned	 to	 see	 who	 it	 was	 and	 my	 right	 shoe	 went	 back	 too	 far,	 the	 heel hanging	 off	 the	 ledge	 taking	 my	 weight	 with	 it.	 Sara	 screamed	 my	 name	 again and	ran	toward	me	from	the	doorway.	I	began	to	fall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	switched	to	slow	motion.	My	arms	wheeling,	Sara	running,	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	she’d	make	it	in	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 lowered	 my	 center	 of	 gravity	 and	 leaned	 forward,	 but	 my	 right	 shoe slipped	off,	took	my	left	foot	and	the	rest	of	me	with	it.	I	threw	my	arms	out	and they	 slammed	 onto	 the	 ledge,	 my	 chin	 bouncing	 off	 the	 concrete	 with	 a	 loud crunch.	Blood	filled	my	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	I	might	make	it	then	my	weight	pulled	me	down,	nothing	for	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands	 to	 grab	 on.	 Sara	 kept	 running,	 about	 ten	 feet	 away,	 the	 sharp	 corner digging	into	my	fingertips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	I	wasn’t	trying	to	with	everything	I	had,	Sara	shouted,	“Hold	on,	Joe! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hold	on!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 blocked	 the	 pain	 and	 scissored	 the	 air	 trying	 to	 find	 the	 wall	 in	 front	 of me.	My	grip	was	almost	gone,	fingers	bleeding,	feet	coming	up	short. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	 skidded	 to	 a	 stop	 and	 grabbed	 hold	 of	 my	 hands	 just	 as	 my	 fingers gave	 way.	 My	 right	 hand	 slipped	 through	 hers,	 but	 she	 held	 onto	 my	 left,	 her nails	sinking	into	my	forearm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	yanked	on	my	arm	with	both	hands,	but	I	was	dropping	inch	by	inch.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">threw	 up	 my	 right	 hand	 and	 gripped	 the	 outside	 of	 the	 ledge.	 It	 stopped	 my descent,	 but	 it	 wouldn’t	 last	 long.	 My	 weight	 had	 already	 pulled	 Sara	 to	 the ledge	and	if	I	didn’t	do	something,	I’d	be	taking	her	with	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	kicked	my	legs	one	more	time	and	my	right	foot	struck	the	smooth	brick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	loud	snap	like	concrete	cracking	and	gravity	kept	pulling	me	down, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	I	held	on,	the	tips	of	both	shoes	now	pressed	against	the	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>I	 was	 about	 to	 push	 off	 and	 up	 the	 wall,	 my	 one	 final	 shot,	 when	 Sara gasped	and	fell	forward,	losing	her	grip.	Her	shin	smashed	into	the	ledge	an	inch from	 my	 nose,	 a	 split	 second	 before	 my	 straining	 neck	 lost	 the	 battle	 and	 my head	was	pulled	over	the	edge,	my	cheek	dragged	across	the	rough	concrete. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	couldn’t	see	anything	but	the	wall	in	front	of	me.	I	flung	my	hand	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	last	seen	Sara	and	clutched	at	the	air.	My	fingers	touched	fabric	and	grabbed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pull,	Sara!	Pull!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	grunted	and	took	off	some	of	the	pressure.	I	dug	the	tips	of	my	shoes</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	the	wall	and	kicked	off	and	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 head	 popped	 over	 the	 ledge	 and	 I	 slammed	 my	 face	 against	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">concrete,	used	it	to	pry	myself	forward.	There	was	a	loud	rip	and	my	hand	fell</p>
<p class="calibre1">against	the	ledge,	Sara’s	sleeve	beneath	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 heaved	 up	 with	 everything	 I	 had	 as	 Sara	 pulled	 and	 grunted	 and	 pulled again.	Finally,	I	was	on	my	back,	the	wet	roof	feeling	so	good.	Safe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither	of	us	said	a	word,	our	ragged	breathing	saying	it	all.	I	tried	to	catch</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 breath	 and	 stared	 at	 the	 gray	 skies.	 When	 I	 was	 able	 to	 sit,	 I	 put	 my	 back against	the	ledge.	Sara	sat	beside	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 was	 too	 embarrassed	 to	 look	 at	 her	 and	 I	 hated	 myself	 for	 ripping	 her blouse	 and	 hurting	 her	 leg.	 I	 grabbed	 hold	 of	 my	 pants	 to	 stop	 shaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	was	numb,	no	pain	anywhere,	but	I’d	feel	it	later.	All	the	blood	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">scraped	skin	promised	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	I	could	speak,	I	said,	“I’m	sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’d	you...?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Danny	called	me.	He	said	you	were...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wasn’t	going	to	jump.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	get	that	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	felt	stupid,	knowing	she	almost	got	me	killed.	She’d	run	right	up	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny’s	call,	terrified	I	was	going	to	take	the	plunge	like	Paul. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’d	 come	 to	 Brightside	 thinking	 that	 Danny	 was	 all	 that	 mattered,	 but then	 she	 had	 to	 go	 and	 meet	 me,	 the	 only	 person	 who’d	 ever	 been	 nice	 to	 her brother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sorry	for	pushing	you	away,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tried	to	lighten	the	mood.	“I’m	just	glad	you	didn’t	push	me	up	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	sat	there	awkwardly.	I	knew	there	were	people	down	below	who	must</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 seen	 what	 just	 happened.	 I	 knew	 there	 were	 people	 down	 there	 that	 were probably	 laughing	 their	 asses	 off.	 I	 wondered	 if	 Krystal	 was	 down	 there laughing,	too.	And	Wayne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	said,	“You’re	an	idiot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>“I	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	makes	you	a	bigger	idiot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	thrown	up	my	middle	fingers	to	get	caught. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 hate	 that	 I	 met	 you,	 Joe.	 I	 really	 do.	 I	 don’t	 want	 my	 life	 to	 be complicated.	I	just	want	things	to	be	normal.	For	once	in	my	stupid	life.	But...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 took	 Sara’s	 face,	 turned	 it	 ever	 so	 slightly,	 that	 cute	 little	 bump	 in	 her nose,	those	eyes.	My	lips	pressed	against	hers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	kisses	are	just	the	prelude	to	sex.	Others	are	simply	a	kind	gesture,	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	 intimate	 thank	 you.	 But	 every	 so	 often,	 a	 kiss	 silences	 everything.	 The universe	 just	 collapses	 and	 obliterates	 your	 silly	 existence.	 You	 realize everything	 you’d	 been	 holding	 onto	 was	 plastic,	 stupid,	 just	 a	 distraction.	 Like Rachel.	I	didn’t	love	her,	never	did.	I	just	wanted	someone	to	hold,	press	against. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	never	felt	like	this.	Not	like	Sara. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Die	or	escape	weren’t	my	only	two	options.	There	was	a	third.	Stay	here	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Brightside.	With	Sara	and	Danny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 thanked	 her	 for	 the	 kiss,	 for	 putting	 up	 with	 me,	 for	 saving	 my	 life.	 I figured	I	might	not	see	them	for	a	while.	My	stunt	would	be	a	ticket	straight	to the	Cabin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	squeezed	my	hand	and	assured	me	everything	would	be	alright. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara’s	entire	arm	was	bare	without	her	sleeve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry	about	the	shirt.	I’ll	get	you	a	new	one,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	worry	about	it.	We	should	get	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	took	me	a	second	to	get	to	my	feet,	the	pain	finally	settling	in.	I	wanted	to thank	 Sara	 for	 being	 so	 calm,	 but	 all	 I	 could	 think	 of	 was	 how	 I	 couldn’t	 even afford	to	buy	her	a	blouse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	stood,	her	shin	all	bloody.	“I’ll	be	okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 made	 our	 way	 down	 the	 stairs,	 my	 legs	 shaky.	 Not	 just	 from	 almost falling.	But	from	the	kiss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	the	hell	were	you	thinking?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	voice.	Not	Sara’s.	Hardly	human.	Crazed,	deadly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stood	at	the	bottom	of	the	stairwell.	Sara’s	eyes	glanced	at	me,	scared.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">told	her	to	go	and	she	went. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	 pinned	 me	 up	 against	 the	 wall.	 “What	 the	 fuck	 were	 you	 doing? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	saw	you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know.	I’m	an	idiot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel’s	eyes	narrowed.	She	raised	her	hand.	I	thought	she	was	going	to	hit</p>
<p class="calibre1">me,	but	she	just	wiped	my	lip	with	her	thumb.	Pink.	Little	flecks	of	glitter.	Sara’s</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>lipstick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel’s	mind	bubbled	with	rage.	Sara’s	sweet	neck	in	her	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	what	you	think.”	The	dumbest	thing	I’d	ever	said,	because	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">exactly	that	and	so	much	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 see...”	 Rachel	 trailed	 off,	 tiny	 steps	 back.	 She	 bumped	 into	 the	 wall, jerked	forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rachel,	calm	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 started	 pulling	 at	 her	 hair.	 Spinning	 round	 and	 round.	 I	 tried	 to	 touch her,	but	she	threw	off	my	hand.	Her	frantic	thoughts	came	in	flashes.	Us	making</p>
<p class="calibre1">love.	 The	 Boots	 dragging	 her	 away.	 Krystal	 underneath	 me.	 Sheila	 telling	 her everything,	the	stupid	bitch	who	promised	she	wouldn’t.	I	was	pouring	water	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	mouth	at	the	Cabin.	I	was	telling	her	we	could	escape	together,	that	I	loved her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	 closing	 in.	 The	 darkness.	 Hurt.	 Anger.	 Everything	 but	 hope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	gone.	Nothing	but	the	vile	truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	 threw	 open	 the	 door,	 ran.	 I	 chased,	 but	 I	 couldn’t	 catch	 her.	 Then Carlos	 grabbed	 my	 arm.	 Demarius	 grabbed	 my	 other.	 Rachel	 kept	 running, crying,	broken	once	again	because	of	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	go	of	me!”	I	shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Naw,	bro,”	Demarius	said.	“You’re	gonna	see	Sharon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a><img src="index-121_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	THIRTEEN</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">AFTER	 SITTING	 IN	 THE	 waiting	 room	 for	 an	 hour,	 Demarius	 brought	 me	 in and	threw	me	in	the	chair.	He	asked	Sharon	if	she	wanted	him	to	stick	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	said	no,	it	was	fine.	Demarius	closed	the	door	and	I	sat	there	staring	at her	stupid	Zen	waterfall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon’s	 mantra	 ran	 at	 full	 volume,	 caused	 my	 fists	 to	 clench.	 Unable	 to listen	another	second,	I	said,	“Why	don’t	you	just	send	me	to	the	Cabin?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that	what	you	want?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Since	when	do	I	have	a	choice?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	chose	to	go	up	to	the	roof,	showing	everyone	what	you	were	capable</p>
<p class="calibre1">of.	A	big	F.U.	to	all	of	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	understand	why	Demarius	had	taken	me	and	not	the	Boots.	I	didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	 one	 of	 those	 assholes	 the	 entire	 walk	 over.	 They	 never	 missed	 a	 chance	 to crack	down	on	an	infraction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would	you	like	me	to	call	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Boots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	just	kept	chewing	on	the	inside	of	my	cheek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Getting	 caught	 makes	 things	 easier,	 doesn’t	 it?	 Takes	 away	 any</p>
<p class="calibre1">responsibility?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 didn’t	 know	 what	 she	 was	 talking	 about,	 but	 I	 figured	 she	 was	 trying	 to probe.	 I	 focused	 on	 Rachel	 and	 Sara,	 even	 Krystal.	 I	 thought	 about	 every	 dirty thing	I’d	done	and	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	looked	disappointed.	Not	disgusted.	Not	angry.	Just	sad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	 was	 different	 about	 her.	 She	 wasn’t	 spewing	 her	 New	 Age</p>
<p class="calibre1">bullshit,	 just	 sat	 there	 waiting	 for	 me	 to	 speak.	 My	 mind	 started	 to	 drift	 to	 the cave,	but	I	refocused.	Thought	about	Danny,	my	drawings,	the	non-existent	fish</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 pond.	 I	 forced	 thoughts	 of	 Steven,	 bald	 and	 frail	 in	 his	 white	 room.	 The picture	of	the	swan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">You	can	trust	me. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 hadn’t	 even	 been	 thinking	 about	 the	 escape,	 but	 it	 seemed	 she	 already knew,	that	she’d	known	for	a	while. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	do	you	think	your	father	turned	you	in?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>“I	don’t	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take	a	guess.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	I’m	a	coward.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon’s	 face	 squinched	 up,	 like	 she	 was	 mulling	 it	 over.	 “Seems	 strange, doesn’t	it?	Your	father	turning	you	in	for	that.	I	mean,	if	he	thought	you	were	a coward,	why	would	he	send	you	here,	where	you	could	easily	tell	us	about	him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	didn’t	make	sense,	but	nothing	ever	did	with	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everything	I	touch	turns	to	shit,”	I	said.	“He	probably	figured	it	was	only	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter	of	time	before	I	fucked	up	and	he	didn’t	want	me	to	get	hurt.	So	he	took</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	necessary	steps	to	make	sure...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	your	father	loves	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 risked	 exposing	 himself,	 didn’t	 he?	 Drawing	 attention	 to	 you,	 put	 the spotlight	on	him.	Seems	pretty	selfless.	He	must	care	about	you	an	awful	lot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	want	to	let	Sharon	see	me	cry.	I	ran	my	fingers	over	the	dried	blood</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	my	chin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	am	I	even	here?	I	broke	the	rules.	I	should	be	in	the	Cabin,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	sighed.	“That’s	correct.”	Then	she	leaned	forward.	“But	you	wanted</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	get	caught,	didn’t	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	honestly	didn’t	know	why	I’d	stood	up	there	like	a	maniac. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	didn’t	think	it	was	fair	to	get	out	by	yourself,	did	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	did	she	know	about	the	escape?	Her	range	was	beyond	mine,	sure.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	been	careful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	also	didn’t	want	to	get	Rachel	hurt,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel...	She	must	have	said	something	in	one	of	their	little	check-ins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	 shook	 her	 head.  <i class="calibre4">She	 never	 shared	 a	 single	 thought. </i>“You	 were afraid	you’d	freeze	at	the	edge	and	they’d	find	you,	putting	Rachel	in	even	more danger.	She	would’ve	been	shot	for	attempting	to	escape.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	the	wrong	opinion	of	me.”  <i class="calibre4">	I’m	a	coward.	I	only	think	of	myself. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	 cocked	 her	 head,	 smiled.	 “I	 don’t	 think	 so.”	 Her	 perfect	 posture returned.	 “Do	 you	 remember	 the	 first	 time	 you	 came	 to	 see	 me?	 I	 said	 I	 had	 a good	feeling	about	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 I	 said	 you	 were	 going	 to	 be	 disappointed.”	 Just	 like	 every	 other woman	dumb	enough	to	get	near	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned.	The	distant	sound	of	the	helicopter	grew	louder	and	louder,	even</p>
<p class="calibre1">shook	 the	 window.	 I	 saw	 the	 metal	 bird	 racing	 across	 the	 sky,	 figured	 it	 was bringing	in	more	pathetic	fuck-ups	like	me.	But	then	it	started	hovering,	like	it was	looking	for	someone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe,	I	need	you	to	look	at	me,”	Sharon	said.	“Joe!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a>I’d	never	heard	Sharon’s	voice	above	a	librarian’s.	My	neck	swiveled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	really	want	to	go	to	the	Cabin?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pictured	myself	in	the	chair,	sitting	there	catatonic,	not	a	care	in	the	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon’s	jaw	clenched.	Her	mantra	was	failing	her.	“You	know	what?	Why</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t	 we	 take	 a	 break?”	 Sharon	 stood,	 threw	 some	 stuff	 in	 her	 purse.	 “I’ll	 be back	in	five	minutes	and	you	can	tell	me	your	decision.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 was	 really	 leaving	 me	 alone	 in	 her	 office.	 The	 door	 closed	 and	 I	 sat there	 confounded,	 almost	 going	 out	 of	 my	 head.	 Was	 this	 some	 sort	 of	 ploy, some	psychological	mind	game? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 helicopter	 was	 still	 hovering.	 I	 got	 up,	 watched	 it	 circling	 around	 the Square,	where	the	Boots	were	patrolling.	Something	bad	was	going	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned,	saw	Sharon’s	desk,	her	stupid	calendar	of	daily	affirmations.	Next</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	it	was	a	letter.	From	my	father.	It	was	addressed	to	Dr.	Sharon	Appleton. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I’m	writing	to	you	on	behalf	of	my	son,	Joe.	He’s	a	good	boy,	might	not</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">seem	like	it	at	first,	but	if	you	have	patience,	I	have	no	doubt	he	can	be</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">everything	you	need	him	to	be. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Turning	 him	 in	 was	 the	 hardest	 decision	 I’ve	 ever	 made	 as	 a	 parent,</i> <i class="calibre4">and	I	will	probably	always	wonder	if	I	made	the	biggest	mistake	of	my</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">life.	 I	 will	 carry	 this	 guilt	 to	 my	 grave,	 because	 I	 can’t	 undo	 it,	 so	 I</i> <i class="calibre4">only	 ask	 that	 you	 look	 out	 for	 him.	 I’m	 trusting	 you	 here.	 He’s	 smart</i> <i class="calibre4">and	 has	 a	 good	 heart.	 He	 might	 not	 always	 act	 like	 it,	 but	 he	 knows</i> <i class="calibre4">right	from	wrong.	And	he’ll	make	the	tough	decision	when	called.	He’s</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">a	soldier,	just	like	his	old	man. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The	only	other	thing	I	ask	is	you	don’t	tell	him	right	away	that	I’m	the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">reason	he’s	there.	He’ll	need	time	to	adjust	first.	But	when	you	feel	he’s</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">ready,	just	let	him	know	that	I	love	him. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	closed	the	door.	“Your	father’s	a	good	man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 tossed	 the	 letter	 on	 her	 desk.	 “For	 turning	 me	 in?	 That’s	 your	 definition</p>
<p class="calibre1">—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	 <i class="calibre4">always</i>	been	a	good	man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stepped	back.	“You	know	my	father?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 do.	 But	 I’m	 not	 going	 to	 say	 another	 word	 about	 it	 until	 I	 know	 your decision.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 way	 she	 said	 it,	 I	 realized	 the	 Cabin	 wasn’t	 just	 a	 physical	 location. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	 wanted	 to	 know	 if	 I’d	 rather	 bury	 my	 head,	 sit	 there	 drugged	 up,	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>mind	a	gentle	sea,	or	if	I	was	ready	to	hear	the	truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	 can’t	 just	 dangle	 something	 like	 that.	 I	 didn’t	 move,	 stood	 there waiting.		Sharon	pointed	to	the	seat.	After	a	few	seconds,	I	sat,	knowing	this	was going	to	hurt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	 walked	 over	 to	 the	 window,	 stared	 out	 at	 the	 whirring	 helicopter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	stood	there	and	I	started	to	shift	uncomfortably,	suddenly	afraid. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">It’s	okay, </i>	she	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 she	 silently	 began	 the	 tale,	 never	 once	 turning	 back,	 knowing	 if	 she looked	me	in	the	eyes,	she’d	never	finish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">According	to	her	account,	Sharon	met	my	father	twenty	years	ago	at	a	small</p>
<p class="calibre1">underground	rally	for	people	like	us.	Hardly	anyone	knew	telepaths	existed,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	 were	 rumors,	 speculation.	 Some	 of	 us	 had	 been	 locked	 in	 loony	 bins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People	like	my	grandmother.	It’s	why	Dad	showed	up	in	the	first	place.	He	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">angry	 and	 alone.	 He	 sat	 in	 the	 back	 and	 listened	 to	 unspeakable	 stories	 of violence	and	fear.	And	everyone	knew	it	was	only	going	to	get	worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 the	 meeting,	 Sharon	 went	 up	 to	 Dad	 and	 they	 shared	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">experiences.	She	asked	if	he	wanted	to	be	more	involved.	Dad	said	he	couldn’t, </p>
<p class="calibre1">told	 her	 he	 had	 a	 family,	 a	 son	 with	 the	 same	 gift.	 He	 didn’t	 want	 to	 draw attention,	see	anything	happen	to	me.	So	he	left,	but	every	so	often,	like	once	or twice	a	year,	he’d	seek	her	out,	wanted	to	know	how	things	were	going,	if	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	anything	he	should	know,	prepare	for,	in	order	to	protect	his	family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	said	he	would’ve	done	anything	to	protect	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	the	government	created	Brightside.	They	started	rounding	up	Thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thieves.	 Soon	 we’d	 all	 be	 on	 the	 mountain	 or	 dead.	 Sharon	 and	 a	 few	 others arranged	for	friends	to	turn	them	in.	To	infiltrate.	Only	a	few	were	selected,	the ones	with	the	strongest	ability,	able	to	quiet	their	thoughts,	block	everyone	out, so	their	secret	would	be	safe.	The	selected	offered	themselves	up,	settled	in,	got chummy	with	the	Boots	as	hundreds	of	people	from	all	over	the	country	arrived</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	helicopter.	These	secret	agents	never	let	on,	never	aroused	any	suspicion,	just quietly	put	themselves	into	positions	of	power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	 moved	 out	 years	 before	 and	 Mom	 hardly	 came	 home,	 so	 Dad</p>
<p class="calibre1">volunteered	to	help	the	cause.	They	turned	him	down	though,	because	when	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">tested	him,	he	couldn’t	keep	it	in,	the	secrets.	He	would	have	broken,	slipped	up, and	all	this	would	be	for	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Months	went	by	and	Dad	kept	trying	to	join	the	fight.	There	was	talk	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Brightside	wasn’t	sustainable.	Too	expensive.	Soon	they’d	have	to	start	cutting</p>
<p class="calibre1">rations,	supplies.	Eventually	there’d	be	only	one	alternative:	execution.	Quietly, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>of	 course.	 America	 would	 never	 hear	 a	 word,	 although	 they	 probably	 wouldn’t care	if	they	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	 when	 Dad	 decided	 to	 offer	 me	 up.	 Since	 I	 didn’t	 know	 anything,	 I wouldn’t	be	a	liability. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	entire	head	felt	like	it	was	about	to	implode.	I	couldn’t	feel	my	hands	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">legs.	Just	this	throbbing	in	my	brain.	Why	would	he... </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Michelle</i>,	Sharon	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	slowly,	it	all	fit	together,	just	like	Grandpa’s	shotgun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 week	 before	 I	 got	 to	 Brightside,	 Michelle	 said	 Dad	 had	 come	 over</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking	for	me.	She	said	he	seemed	panicked,	asked	for	a	drink.	She	said	he	sat</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	 for	 an	 hour	 waiting	 for	 me,	 but	 I	 was	 working	 late,	 trying	 to	 boost	 my bonus.	She	turned	on	the	TV,	a	newscast	about	Brightside.	Michelle	said	she	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	trying	to	make	conversation,	talked	a	bit	about	how	dangerous	these	people</p>
<p class="calibre1">were.	Dad	said	he	agreed,	but	kept	asking	these	strange	questions.	She	thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	was	just	afraid	like	the	rest	of	the	country.	But	here	in	Sharon’s	office,	I	knew Dad	had	been	testing	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Michelle	 would’ve	 turned	 me	 in	 without	 hesitation,	 even	 called	 up	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">brothers	to	take	care	of	me	first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Michelle’s	mind	made	up	Dad’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 couldn’t	 breathe.	 Everything	 closing	 in,	 the	 walls.	 Sharon’s	 stupid</p>
<p class="calibre1">waterfall	was	all	I	could	hear,	sounded	like	someone	was	pissing	in	my	ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 went	 for	 her	 desk,	 ready	 to	 tell	 Sharon	 to	 inject	 me,	 to	 make	 everything calm,	like	Rachel	was	in	the	Cabin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe,	you	need	to	calm	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	words	to	Rachel	coming	out	of	Sharon’s	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I’m	sorry, </i>	she	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	saw	my	father’s	face,	that	big,	dumb	grin.	I	yelled	at	her	and	pressed	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">thumbs	into	my	closed	eyes,	shoving	them	back	into	my	skull. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	flung	open.	Demarius	ran	in,	tackled	me	into	the	chair.	Pinned	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">arms.	I	kept	fighting.	Demarius	pulled	tighter. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Enough! </i>	Sharon	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I	told	you	he	was	going	to	crack. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	 bent	 down,	 touched	 my	 face	 like	 I	 was	 a	 child.  <i class="calibre4">No,	 he’s	 not.	 Isn’t</i> <i class="calibre4">that	right,	Joe? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	about	Mom,	rubbing	butter	on	my	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe,	what’s	it	going	to	be?”	Sharon	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	just	send	this	motherfucker	to	the	Cabin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quiet.”	Sharon	forced	my	eyes	to	hers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">What’s	your	decision? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>My	father’s	voice	flowing	through	my	brain.  <i class="calibre4">Whatever	you	need. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	found	myself	ten	minutes	later	in	the	lobby.	I	don’t	even	remember	taking</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 elevator.	 People	 were	 gathered	 outside	 the	 double-doors.	 There	 were whispers	about	a	death.	I	entered	the	fray	wondering	if	they	were	talking	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Robert	 was	 four	 feet	 in	 front	 of	 me,	 his	 big	 black	 microphone	 held	 to	 his throat,	the	wire	traveling	down	to	the	brown	box	at	his	waist.	He	said,	“Hey.	Joe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You.	Know.	What’s.	Going.	On.”	The	lack	of	inflection	made	it	so	you	couldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">figure	if	Robert	was	asking	or	telling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	idea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wayne.	King.	Escaped.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	reason	for	the	accelerated	news,	why	Sharon	and	Demarius	said	we	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	do	this	tomorrow	night,	the	end	of	Day	100.	Their	plan,	my	gun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m.	Going.	To.	Catch.	Him,”	Robert	said.	“Want.	To.	Join.	My.	Team?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Robert	 kept	 talking,	 but	 I	 couldn’t	 hear	 with	 the	 helicopter	 directly</p>
<p class="calibre1">overhead.	 The	 woods	 were	 only	 a	 few	 blocks	 away.	 Part	 of	 me	 wanted	 to	 say fuck	it.	Take	off	out	the	cave.	Sharon,	Demarius,	and	Dad	could	eat	a	big	bag	of shit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 hadn’t	 meant	 to	 think	 it	 so	 close	 to	 Robert,	 but	 his	 eyes	 widened,	 knew what	was	rattling	around	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 started	 walking.	 The	 helicopter	 kept	 circling,	 scouring	 the	 town	 for Wayne.	I	kept	thinking	about	taking	off	now,	but	knew	I	wouldn’t	make	it	fifty</p>
<p class="calibre1">feet	 before	 they	 caught	 me.	 I	 also	 couldn’t	 leave	 Rachel	 behind.	 Not	 like	 this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 deserved	 better.	 All	 she	 did	 was	 believe	 in	 me.	 Love	 me.	 Wanted	 to	 take care	of	me.	And	I	repaid	her	by	ripping	out	her	broken	heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 turned	 left,	 the	 Cabin	 up	 on	 the	 hill,	 its	 windows	 open,	 all	 warm	 and inviting. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Come	on	in,	have	a	seat.	Let	your	problems	disintegrate. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel’s	building	was	up	ahead.	Sharon	said	to	let	her	be,	said	I	needed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	some	rest.	Sharon	loved	to	talk.	Just	like	Dad.	The	two	of	them	plotting	and scheming	to	stick	me	up	on	this	goddamn	mountain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 knocked	 on	 Rachel’s	 door,	 kept	 knocking	 until	 her	 neighbor,	 Frances, came	out	and	told	me	to	shut	the	hell	up	or	she’d	call	the	Boots.	Frances	looked like	a	man	with	her	chiseled	jaw	and	thick,	bushy	eyebrows.	I	almost	told	her	to go	ahead,	they’d	never	show.	But	I	just	walked	out	and	headed	for	the	diner,	then Oscar’s,	 then	 the	 park.	 I	 asked	 if	 anyone	 had	 seen	 her.	 No	 one	 had,	 except Nathan,	the	guy	who	proudly	came	to	Brightside	a	virgin.	Then	he	met	Krystal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	 wasn’t	 looking	 so	 hot,”	 he	 said	 about	 Rachel.	 “That	 was	 a	 couple hours	ago,	though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>I	thanked	him	and	continued	my	search.	I	needed	to	find	Rachel,	apologize, beg	her	to	take	me	back.	We	could	escape	tonight,	leave	Sharon,	everyone	in	this fucking	town. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 kept	 moving,	 never	 stopping	 long	 enough	 to	 think	 about	 anything	 but Rachel.	She	was	going	to	be	pissed,	but	I’d	tell	her	all	the	things	she	needed	to hear.	I’d	mean	it,	too.	At	least	for	the	moment.	That’d	be	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	had	given	me	a	special	cell	phone,	one	that	couldn’t	be	traced.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">told	me	to	only	use	it	if	there	was	an	emergency.	I	wanted	to	call	Rachel,	but	she didn’t	have	a	phone.	No	one	did	but	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wandered	through	the	Square,	even	went	back	to	Rachel’s	place,	but	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	wasn’t	there.	I	started	thinking	maybe	she’d	found	some	guy	and	they	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">busy	getting	sweaty	paying	me	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	even	notice	the	storm	rushing	in,	but	soon	the	sleet	felt	like	needles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thunder	boomed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	midnight	and	I	could	barely	stand.	Freezing,	wet,	and	weak,	I	headed</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	to	my	place.	The	hallway	light	fixture	was	filled	with	so	many	bugs	I	could hardly	see,	but	my	nose	was	working	fine.	There	was	a	new	smell.	A	little	ripe, </p>
<p class="calibre1">like	sweat	and	something	else.	It	grew	stronger	as	I	got	to	my	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	smell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	did	its	usual	creak,	just	a	lot	louder.	The	kitchen	was	dark,	blinds</p>
<p class="calibre1">keeping	 out	 most	 of	 the	 moonlight.	 I	 emptied	 my	 pockets	 onto	 the	 table,	 then locked	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	sliver	of	light	lit	the	first	bit	of	hallway	that	led	to	the	bedroom	where	the blinds	were	always	closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	looked	normal,	as	normal	as	it	can	in	the	dark.	It	sounded	like	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">should,	too.	Quiet.	Everything	was	fine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Except	for	the	smell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	that	sliver.	The	tiny	slice	of	light	that	made	it	hard	to	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	was	here.	My	first	thought,	Wayne,	but	the	door	had	been	locked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	for	the	light	switch,	but	it	just	flicked	up	and	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said	Rachel’s	name	but	it	came	out	soft	and	pathetic.	I	said	it	again,	louder</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	time.	Rachel	was	the	only	one	with	a	key. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	one	answered.	Just	more	nothing.	Then	the	tiniest	plop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 took	 forever	 to	 move	 away	 from	 the	 door	 and	 get	 into	 the	 hallway.	 I stopped	after	two	steps	because	the	smell	was	all	wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	step	was	the	hardest.	The	next	one	after	that	even	harder,	the	wall</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	blocking	most	of	the	bedroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	wall	ended	with	my	next	step.	My	hand	fumbled	around	for	the	switch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	one	worked,	threw	light	all	over	the	room.	I	wish	it	hadn’t.	Oh	God,	I	wish</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>it	hadn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	body	on	the	bed.	But	lying	the	wrong	way,	legs	hanging	off	the	window</p>
<p class="calibre1">side.		The	plaid	skirt	bunched	up	around	her	underwear.	Rachel’s	favorite	Love-</p>
<p class="calibre1">A-Lot	 Care	 Bear	 ones	 she	 liked	 to	 dance	 around	 in.	 Her	 matching	 t-shirt	 that used	to	be	white,	the	bear	and	its	big	heart	drowning	in	blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	outfit	told	me	it	was	Rachel.	Rachel	without	a	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 top	 of	 her	 head	 was	 gone,	 her	 hair	 clumped	 beneath	 the	 ragged, </p>
<p class="calibre1">hollowed	out	bowl,	a	stream	sliding	down	the	comforter,	onto	the	carpet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	asked	the	stupidest	question.	“What	the	hell	did	you	do?”	I	asked	it	again</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	again	but	the	answer	was	right	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned.	The	whole	room	was	red,	it	started	to	spin.	Slow	then	fast.	I	held</p>
<p class="calibre1">onto	 the	 wall	 and	 it	 helped	 a	 little,	 but	 it	 was	 wet	 with	 something	 I	 wiped	 off without	looking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Goddamn	it,	Rachel!	What	the	hell	did	you	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	didn’t	respond,	didn’t	have	a	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	on	the	floor	I	received	my	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	shotgun	beneath	her	dangling	feet,	the	stock	lying	in	the	puddle	of	piss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lightest	rain	fell	from	the	ceiling.	It	drip,	drip,	dripped	onto	the	bed,	her body,	what	was	left	of	her	head.	I	wondered	if	the	roof	was	leaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 it	 wasn’t	 rain.	 Up	 on	 the	 ceiling,	 Rachel	 left	 me	 a	 gift.	 She’d	 painted me	the	perfect	Pollock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 fell	 onto	 her	 body,	 my	 face	 smashed	 against	 that	 bloody	 Care	 Bear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thunder	 boomed	 outside	 the	 window.	 I	 wondered	 if	 that’s	 what	 covered	 the blast.	If	someone	had	heard	it,	they’d	be	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bracelet	her	daddy	bought	her	was	half	submerged	in	a	puddle	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pillow,	the	diamonds	splattered	crimson.	They	matched	her	ring,	the	only	thing</p>
<p class="calibre1">better	than	her	diploma	because	the	school	couldn’t	take	it	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	didn’t	have	a	pulse.	I	was	stupid	to	check.	Her	wrist	still	warm,	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">soft.	 Her	 hand	 so	 small,	 not	 squeezing	 back	 to	 say	 everything	 would	 be	 okay, that	we	could	still	leave	together,	sprawl	out	on	that	beach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	creaked	in	the	hallway	outside.	Bootsteps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 pressed	 my	 cheek	 into	 the	 bedspread	 as	 if	 I	 was	 actually	 hiding.	 Like	 a child	who	doesn’t	understand	the	physics	of	hide-and-seek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More	bootsteps.	Muffled	voices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel’s	hand	went	back	into	the	puddle.	I	pulled	the	rest	of	her	closer.	Saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	jaw.	The	lower	half	on	Love-A-Lot’s	smiling	face.	The	top	half	shards	on	the ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 waited	 for	 the	 knock,	 waited	 to	 see	 their	 expressions	 when	 they	 saw	 me cradling	Rachel	without	a	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>The	light	switch.	I	needed	to	turn	it	off,	make	them	think	I	was	sleeping,	but I	couldn’t	move.	Every	neuron	dead,	just	like	Rachel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	chair	had	a	chunk	of	hair	draped	across	the	armrest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Boots	getting	closer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 closed	 my	 eyes,	 squeezed	 Rachel’s	 chest,	 squeezing	 so	 hard	 I	 thought	 I might	sink	into	her	ribs,	disappear	forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why	 did	 I	 ever	 come	 here?	 The	 Cabin	 was	 so	 close.	 All	 I	 had	 to	 do	 was walk	in,	and	the	nurses	would	take	care	of	the	rest.	I’d	never	know	about	Rachel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Never... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly,	 the	 Boots	 were	 running,	 but	 not	 towards	 me.	 Each	 step	 softer, further	down	the	hall	until	there	was	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	hard	to	stand	without	one	hand	on	the	wall.	I	looked	around,	needing</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 way	 to	 explain	 this	 in	 case	 they	 came	 back.	 There	 was	 nothing	 on	 the nightstand,	the	TV,	the	bathroom	counter.	No	paper,	something	that	said	no	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	to	blame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Rachel	would	never	leave	a	note.	That’s	what	she’d	told	me	one	night</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 Oscar’s.	 She	 said	 people	 only	 wrote	 them	 to	 make	 other	 people	 feel	 better, which	was	bullshit.	If	she	ever	did	it,	she	wanted	everyone	to	know	it	was	their fucking	fault. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Why	did	they	ever	let	you	out	of	the	Cabin,	Rachel? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	had	to	know	she	was	unstable,	that	this	was	a	possibility.	She	didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	 the	 call	 on	 Rachel’s	 release,	 but	 she	 gave	 her	 recommendation.	 Was	 this part	of	the	plan?	What	the	hell	did	Rachel	have	to	do	with	our	escape? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 fell	 back	 against	 the	 wall,	 slid	 down	 until	 my	 ass	 was	 on	 the	 floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	 was	 digging	 into	 my	 leg.	 The	 cell	 phone.	 I	 pulled	 it	 out,	 started	 to dial	Sharon,	but	stopped.	What	if	this	was	all	a	setup?	She	could	just	be	waiting for	me	to	call,	so	she	could	send	Palmer	and	the	rest	of	the	fucking	Boots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	why	tell	me	about	the	plan	then?	Why	tell	me	about	my	father	if	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	to	set	me	up	for	Rachel’s	death?	She	could’ve	sent	me	to	the	Cabin.	I	even</p>
<p class="calibre1">offered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 father,	 the	 man	 who	 turned	 me	 in,	 was	 the	 only	 person	 I	 could	 trust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Laughter	 sprayed	 from	 my	 lips.	 I	 looked	 over	 at	 Rachel’s	 body,	 the	 blood	 and chunks	 of	 brain	 and	 just	 lost	 it,	 doubling	 over,	 cracking	 up	 because	 there	 was nothing	left.	I	didn’t	need	the	Cabin.	I	was	already	fucking	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 it	 finally	 lost	 its	 amusement.	 The	 awfulness	 settling	 back	 in.	 I	 started dialing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello?”	Mom	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	couldn’t	speak,	so	tired,	shattered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joey?	Is	that	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a><img src="index-130_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	a	deep	breath,	wiped	back	my	hair	wet	with	blood.	“Hi,	Mom!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joey,	what’s	going	on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	whole	body	shook.	“I	fucked	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joey,	come	on,	you’re	scaring	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	I’m	scaring	me	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	me	what’s	going	on.	Are	you	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I’m	not.”	I	sucked	air	through	clenched	teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	sat	there,	breathing,	waiting.	We	both	did	until	she	finally	asked	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh...I	don’t	have	enough	minutes	for	that.	Can	I	just	talk	to	Dad?	Please.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">really	just	need	for	him	to	get	on	the	fucking	phone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	going	to	call	the	doctor,	okay.	Is	that	what	I	should—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“NO,	 MOM,”	 I	 said,	 my	 voice	 not	 my	 own.	 Wild	 and	 crazed	 like	 a	 man covered	 in	 his	 girlfriend’s	 blood.	 I	 took	 a	 deep	 breath.	 “I	 just	 need	 you	 to	 get Dad.	Can	you	just	move	and	fucking	grant	me	this	one	simple—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sounded	scared	out	of	her	mind	when	she	said,	“He’s	not	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Big	inhale	through	the	nose.	“Okay...when	do	you	expect	him?	Soon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	went...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where?	He	went	where?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	smallest	voice,	she	said,	“Fishing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	felt	like	the	top	of	my	head	was	going	to	eject	like	some	fighter	jet,	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	went...fishing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joey,	 he	 needed	 a	 break.	 Since	 you	 –	 since	 he...did	 this,	 it’s	 been	 eating him	alive.	He’s	not	well.	It’s	killing	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">My	father’s	not	well.	I’m	sitting	on	the	floor	covered	in	Rachel’s	flesh,	and</i> <i class="calibre4">my	father	needs	a	vacation. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joey,	whatever	you’ve	done,	can	you	make	it	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	Mom.”	I	laughed.	“No,	I	don’t	think	I	can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joey!	 Listen	 to	 me.	 Are	 you	 listening	 to	 me?”	 That	 voice	 from	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">childhood,	 the	 one	 that	 said	 if	 I	 didn’t	 shut	 my	 mouth	 she	 was	 going	 to	 smack me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	WAS	FIVE	YEARS	OLD,	sitting	in	the	back	of	the	Buick,	my	face	burned	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">peeling.	 We	 were	 parked	 out	 in	 front	 of	 the	 school,	 all	 the	 kids	 filing	 in,	 but	 I wouldn’t	budge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	wanna.	I	feel	sick.	My	stomach.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>“You’re	 fine,”	 she	 said.	 “You	 just	 don’t	 want	 to	 go	 with	 your	 face	 all messed	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 that	 was	 only	 part	 of	 it.	 I	 couldn’t	 go	 back	 to	 all	 the	 voices,	 the thoughts,	everything	so	loud	I’d	piss	my	pants.	I	didn’t	say	any	of	that	to	Mom, she	wouldn’t	have	understood	or	she’d	think	I	was	even	crazier	than	she	already</p>
<p class="calibre1">did.	That’s	why	I	just	sat	and	scratched	at	my	cheeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	snapped,	“What	did	I	say	about	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shoved	both	mittens	back	in	my	jacket.	“I	forgot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	want	to	look	retarded?	You	think	they	aren’t	going	to	make	fun	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	kid	tearing	off	his	face?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 slushy	 gray	 playground	 was	 right	 outside	 my	 window.	 All	 the	 kids</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	out	there,	but	I	wasn’t	moving.	I	blew	on	my	window,	fogged	it	up	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">white	cloud,	slunk	down	so	low	I	couldn’t	see	out.	I	knew	what	was	waiting,	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	laughter,	the	vicious	taunts.	I’d	start	crying	and	they’d	call	me	a	little	baby and	that	would	be	even	worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	 was	 back	 to	 smiling	 at	 herself	 in	 the	 rearview,	 her	 eyes	 not	 quite making	it.	She	was	back	to	sounding	nice,	too.	“Come	on,	Joey.	You	know	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">drill.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 drill	 was	 Mom	 pulled	 over,	 I	 got	 out.	 There	 was	 no	 holding	 hands, walking	 together	 to	 the	 gate.	 No	 kiss	 goodbye.	 But	 the	 drill	 was	 different	 this morning.	I	wasn’t	moving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	 got	 something	 from	 her	 purse,	 brushed	 red	 on	 her	 cheeks	 until	 they matched	her	hair.	“You	need	to	get	going.	Go	learn	your	ABC’s.	We’re	not	doing</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	anymore.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	safe	spot	was	warm.	It	wasn’t	totally	safe,	but	far	enough	away	so	Mom</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	have	to	climb	over	the	seat	to	swat.	She	wouldn’t	do	that	in	front	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">school.	Not	for	a	few	more	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 enough,”	 she	 said.	 Mom	 flicked	 her	 eyes,	 played	 with	 the	 lashes, never	once	looking	my	way.	“I’m	wasting	time.	And	gas.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tried	not	to	sound	like	a	baby	when	I	said,	“I	hate	school.	I	don’t	want	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	 turned	 the	 mirror,	 gave	 her	 you-little-shit	 five-second	 stare.	 “You think	I	want	to	drive	you	here?	You	think	I	want	to	dress	you	in	the	morning	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	your	Lucky	Charms?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 knew	 a	 lot	 about	 Mom,	 way	 more	 than	 I	 wanted.	 I	 thought	 I	 knew	 her buttons,	how	far	I	could	press	them.	That’s	why	I	said,	“Don’t	then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	spun	around,	gripped	the	back	of	her	seat.	“Goddamn	it,	young	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	you	make	me	get	out	of	this	car...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	“They’re	mean	to	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>Mom	moved	quicker	than	I’d	ever	seen,	getting	out	and	slamming	her	door, jerking	 on	 mine	 to	 see	 it	 was	 locked.	 She	 stood	 there	 in	 her	 purple	 leotard, banged	the	window	with	her	fist.	“Open	this	right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	was	about	to	break	through	the	glass.	I	slid	across	the	seat,	pulled	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">knob	up,	went	right	back	to	my	spot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	 opened	 the	 door,	 lowered	 her	 voice	 so	 other	 parents	 couldn’t	 hear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	freezing.	Get	out	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 looked	 away	 from	 Mom’s	 chest,	 put	 my	 boots	 on	 the	 seat.	 “I’m	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1">going.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	started	talking	way	too	sweet,	like	her	goddamn	perfume,	didn’t	care</p>
<p class="calibre1">how	much	they	both	bothered	me.	“Sometimes	there	are	things	you	don’t	want</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	do,	but	you	gotta	do	them	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tameka’s	dad	walked	by	which	explained	Mom	being	nice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	turned	toward	him	and	waved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Tameka’s	dad	was	far	enough	away,	Mom	snatched	my	ankle	like	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	some	kind	of	snake,	squeezed	my	boot	like	she	was	trying	to	choke	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	hurting	me,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	kept	her	grip	and	yanked	me	across	the	seat.	“Stop	being	such	a	sissy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is	that	what	you	want	all	the	other	kids	to	think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stomped	 my	 foot	 as	 hard	 as	 I	 could,	 splashed	 yucky	 gray	 snow	 all	 over Mom’s	leg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	took	a	deep	breath	and	blew	it	out,	put	those	eyes	on	me.	Made	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">stare	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 do	 you	 want,	 Joey?”	 She	 stood	 there,	 hands	 on	 her	 hips,	 nipples pushing	out	that	purple	silk	for	everyone	to	see.	“You	want	me	to	lie	to	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	I	wanted	didn’t	matter	because	Mom	was	holding	up	her	don’t-you-</p>
<p class="calibre1">dare	finger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	lie	to	you,	if	that’s	what	you	want,”	she	said.	“Say	you	look	fine.	That</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	one’s	going	to	make	fun	of	you.	That	the	world	is	the	most	wonderful	place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	one-woman	pep	rally	wasn’t	making	me	feel	any	better,	but	that	didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">slow	her	down.	“You	looking	like	this	is	nothing,”	Mom	said.	“You’re	gonna	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">teased.	You’re	gonna	get	picked	on.	You’re	gonna	get	beat	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tried	to	say	enough,	I	was	ready	for	school,	but	Mom	kept	talking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 gonna	 fall	 in	 love.	 You’re	 gonna	 have	 your	 heart	 broken.	 Your dreams	are	gonna	be	squashed.	That’s	life,”	Mom	said.	“That’s	the	truth.	So	it’s your	choice,	Joey.	You	want	the	truth	or	not?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	I	knew	what	was	coming	maybe	I	could	prepare	for	it.	I	said,	“The	truth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	 bent	 over	 at	 the	 waist	 and	 put	 her	 face	 close.	 Gave	 guys	 driving	 by something	nice	to	stare	at. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a><img src="index-133_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	eyes	weren’t	trying	any	more.	The	fight	was	over.	But	Mom	still	smiled</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	she	took	hold	of	my	jaw	and	turned	my	face	side	to	side.	She	ran	her	ice-</p>
<p class="calibre1">cold	 fingers	 over	 my	 cheeks,	 brushed	 flakes	 of	 me	 into	 the	 slush.	 “When	 life sucks	 and	 gives	 you	 things	 you	 don’t	 want,	 you’ve	 got	 to	 keep	 your	 chin	 up,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom	said.	She	kissed	the	top	of	my	head.	“And	keep	it	up	no	matter	what,	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear?	Because	people	are	depending	on	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">THAT’S	 WHAT	 MOM	 WAS	 saying	 on	 the	 phone,	 me	 on	 the	 floor,	 Rachel’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">faceless	head	on	the	pillow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can	never	quit,”	she	said.	“Never.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	FOURTEEN</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">IT’S	LUNCHTIME	AND	Sara	still	hasn’t	come	back.	I’m	at	my	desk	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">door	closed,	lights	off,	acting	like	nobody’s	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	on	no	sleep	and	little	food.	I	know	I	can’t	keep	this	up,	but	how	can	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">eat?	 Not	 when	 all	 I	 can	 think	 of	 is	 Rachel	 and	 what’s	 left	 of	 her,	 the	 saddest secret	I’ve	ever	held. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cleaning	up	Rachel’s	body	was	my	form	of	grief.	I	was	crying,	holding	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	my	arms,	remembering	the	good	times.	I	kept	stroking	her	neck,	because	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">cheek	 was	 gone,	 just	 cradled	 her	 in	 my	 arms,	 rocking	 back	 and	 forth, apologizing	 for	 all	 the	 things	 I’d	 done,	 for	 the	 things	 I	 wouldn’t	 say.	 I	 told	 her she	was	beautiful,	especially	her	nose,	the	one	she	hated,	the	one	somewhere	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">pieces	 behind	 the	 nightstand.	 For	 some	 reason,	 I	 sang	 Dad’s	 stupid	 song	 about fish	 heads.	 I	 told	 Rachel,	 Dad	 would	 have	 liked	 her,	 even	 though	 he	 probably wouldn’t	have.	It	was	okay	to	fib.	The	part	of	her	that	knew	if	I	was	lying	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">splattered	all	over	the	ceiling,	the	wall,	the	bed.	It	was	the	part	she	just	wanted gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wondered	what	was	going	through	her	head	when	her	thumb	pushed	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 trigger.	 Besides	 the	 buckshot.	 I	 hoped	 it	 wasn’t	 about	 me,	 prayed	 she didn’t	 go	 out	 on	 such	 a	 sour	 note.	 I	 wanted	 to	 believe	 she	 was	 picturing	 that tropical	beach,	just	her	and	the	surf.	No	one	around	for	miles.	Not	a	single	soul with	all	their	fucked	up,	twisted	thoughts.	Just	her,	the	sand,	a	giant	piña	colada. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	kept	rocking,	picturing	her	turning	the	shotgun	around,	getting	her	fingers</p>
<p class="calibre1">curled	under	the	handle	between	her	knees.	Her	thumb	fits	perfect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	barrel’s	so	long,	the	hole	so	big	and	black	and	forever.	To	get	this	right</p>
<p class="calibre1">she’s	leaning	forward,	bending	her	head,	mouth	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	metal’s	cold	but	clean.	The	barrel	digs	into	the	roof	of	her	mouth,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">front	sight	splitting	her	lower	lip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	doesn’t	matter.	Nothing	matters	any	more.	It	never	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	eyes	water	when	she	pushes	the	shotgun	higher,	tearing	into	the	flesh	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	knows	exactly	where	it	is,	making	sure	the	angle’s	just	right.	That’s	all	she wants...something	to	be	right.	For	once.  <i class="calibre4">Please</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	she	needs	is	ten	pounds	of	pressure.	Ten	pounds	and	all	of	her	pain	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	gone.	No	more	thoughts	ever	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’s	got	the	meaty	part	of	her	thumb	on	the	trigger.	She’s	closing	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>Ten	 pounds	 isn’t	 much.	 Just	 a	 quick	 shove.	 A	 quick	 shove	 and	 everything stops.	No	more	Brightside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	bead	of	sweat’s	running	down	her	nose,	the	one	that’s	now	in	pieces.	Her</p>
<p class="calibre1">mouth’s	filled	with	saliva.	It’s	dribbling	out	the	corners,	down	her	chin,	just	like when	I	tried	to	make	her	drink	in	the	Cabin.	She	needs	to	hurry.	Almost	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’s	thinking	goodbye,	no	one	around	to	hear.	She’s	thinking	sorry	for	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 men	 who	 put	 her	 through	 hell.	 She’s	 picturing	 me,	 her	 father,	 the	 lacrosse team.	She’s	putting	more	pressure	on	the	trigger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	now	or	never... </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 loudest	 bang,	 but	 she	 only	 hears	 one-tenth.	 All	 her	 problems	 blasting out	of	her	head.	Then	silence.	Peace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holding	Rachel	got	me	thinking	about	Steven.	A	few	days	after	he	passed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">his	parents	had	a	funeral.	There	was	some	old	Chinese	lady	playing	a	harp,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">women	 wearing	 veils,	 the	 men	 holding	 them	 tightly,	 rubbing	 their	 arms	 for comfort.	Steven’s	mom	even	rented	a	swan	to	waddle	around	and	stretch	its	neck</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	they	lowered	Steven’s	little	casket	into	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	 begged	 Dad	 not	 to	 make	 me	 go,	 but	 he	 said	 every	 man	 needs	 to	 face death,	it’s	coming	whether	we	like	it	or	not.	Steven’s	mom	threw	herself	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">casket.	 Steven’s	 dad	 pried	 her	 off.	 I’d	 never	 heard	 such	 screams.	 The	 swan apparently	hadn’t	either	and	started	attacking	Steven’s	aunt.	Dad	told	me	to	help, and	the	thing	bit	my	hand	and	took	off	for	the	pond. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still,	Steven	got	a	proper	burial.	Something	I	couldn’t	give	Rachel.	If	I	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">called	anyone,	they’d	find	the	shotgun	and	they’d	drug	and	interrogate	me	until	I cracked.	 Dad	 would	 finally	 get	 his	 wish	 to	 be	 in	 Brightside,	 but	 no	 one	 else would	ever	leave.	They’d	find	the	cave,	seal	it	off,	and	we’d	all	be	stuck.	Things would	change.	They’d	bring	more	Boots,	more	cameras,	making	sure	none	of	us</p>
<p class="calibre1">tried	anything	like	this	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stared	 into	 Love-A-Lot’s	 eyes.	 “I’m	 sorry,	 I’m	 so	 sorry.	 But	 people	 are depending	on	me,	and	I’ve	already	let	too	many	people	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	lifted	what	was	left	of	Rachel	into	my	arms	and	carried	her	to	the	closet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	 with	 my	 parent’s	 voices	 telling	 me	 time	 was	 running	 out,	 I	 started cleaning,	 put	 on	 some	 yellow	 rubber	 gloves.	 I	 started	 with	 the	 big	 chunks, tossing	them	into	a	black	trash	bag,	each	piece	plopping	onto	the	one	before.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">ran	out	of	paper	towels,	had	to	use	the	extra	set	of	sheets.	I	kept	pouring	bleach, scrubbing	 the	 floors,	 never	 really	 getting	 all	 the	 blood	 and	 bits,	 just	 sort	 of swirling	it	around	and	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 took	 two	 showers,	 dug	 my	 nails	 into	 the	 soap,	 scrapping	 out	 the	 little flecks	of	Rachel.	I	scrubbed	so	hard	at	my	skin	I	thought	I’d	reach	bone.	Then	I air-dried	because	I’d	used	both	bath	towels	on	the	floor.	I	brushed	my	teeth	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a><img src="index-136_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="index-136_2.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">combed	my	hair	like	it	was	any	other	morning	here	in	Brightside.	Everything’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">fine.	Just	going	to	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 swept	 the	 last	 puddles	 towards	 the	 kitchen,	 made	 sure	 there	 was	 nothing left	that	could	leak	into	the	hall.	I	stood	in	front	of	the	open	closet,	told	Rachel	I was	 sorry,	 that	 this	 would	 all	 be	 over	 soon.	 Someone	 would	 take	 her	 to	 the cemetery,	bury	her	like	she	deserved.	Then	I	closed	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 sun	 was	 beginning	 to	 rise,	 soft	 reds	 and	 yellows	 sifting	 up	 from	 the darkness.	Day	100	had	officially	been	going	for	hours,	but	it	wasn’t	until	the	sun took	its	place	above	the	horizon,	that	this	really	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">SARA	FINALLY	COMES	back	into	the	office	right	after	lunch.	She	looks	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">she’s	just	witnessed	an	execution.	For	a	second,	I	wonder	if	I’m	thinking	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel,	but	I’m	not.	I’m	just	staring	at	Sara,	wondering	what	the	hell	happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	picks	up	the	rose	off	her	desk,	the	one	meant	for	Rachel,	the	one	from	Alex. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	going	to	be	going	away	for	a	while.”	Her	voice	so	soft	and	confused</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s	as	if	she’s	still	refusing	to	believe	it.	“The	Council	decided	I	need	some	time in	the	Cabin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	what?	You	haven’t	done	anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	roof	is	off-limits	and	I	broke	the	rule.”	She	turns	to	me,	already	in	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">head.	She	smiles.	“Don’t	worry,	you’re	fine.	Sharon	informed	them	it	was	part	of your	treatment.	You’ve	been	cleared	of	all	infractions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sara,	you	don’t	have	to	go.	I	can	talk—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 shakes	 her	 head	 like	 she’s	 trying	 to	 fling	 out	 every	 single	 thought	 of mine,	every	moment	we	shared.	“Don’t!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sara...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 Joe,	 you’ve	 done	 enough	 already.	 And	 it’s	 my	 fault.	 My	 fault	 for thinking...” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Sara,	 you	 don’t	 understand.	 Everyone’s	 leaving.	 Tonight.	 This	 place	 won’t</i> <i class="calibre4">be	safe.	It’s	your	last	shot. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">No,	Joe.	It’s	yours.	I’m	not	coming. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	wipes	the	mascara	running	down	her	cheek.	“Now,	I	have	a	few	hours</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 spend	 with	 Danny	 so	 I’m	 going	 to	 go.”	 She	 gets	 to	 the	 door,	 opens	 it,	 but stops.	 She’s	 thinking	 of	 asking	 me	 to	 stay,	 to	 put	 an	 end	 to	 this	 before	 I	 get myself	killed.	Then	she	wonders	if	things	wouldn’t	be	better	that	way.	She	clicks her	teeth,	upset	at	herself,	at	me.	She	leaves,	never	once	looking	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>I	FIND	SHARON	IN	HER	office.	She’s	with	this	frail	Spanish	man,	one	of	the new	Brightsiders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shout	at	her,	“What	the	hell	did	you	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	Joe,	as	you	can	see	I’m	with	a	patient.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	little	Spanish	man	stares	at	me	with	his	sad	eyes,	but	mine	are	locked</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	Sharon’s.	“You	can’t	do	this,”	I	tell	her.	“You	can’t	send	Sara—” </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">can	be	arranged,	you	know? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	realize	the	Spanish	man	speaks	no	English.	He	says,	“Debo	ir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	Sharon	says.	“Joe’s	leaving.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	no	estoy,”	I	tell	her.	Then	I	turn	to	the	man	and	say,	“Salir!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	picks	up	his	hat	from	his	lap	and	scurries	out	of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	 forces	 a	 smile	 and	 closes	 the	 door.	 “Glad	 to	 see	 those	 tapes	 are paying	off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can’t	lock	her	away	in—” </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">He’ll	be	joining	her	shortly. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	 and	 her	 perfect	 plan.	 I	 realize	 I	 have	 no	 idea	 who	 this	 woman	 is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First	she’s	spewing	New	Age	bullshit.	Now’s	she’s	the	leader	of	a	revolution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	one’s	ever	what	they	seem	on	the	surface. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	need	to	go	back	to	work,”	Sharon	says.	“Finish	the	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	picture	my	office,	Sara’s	desk,	the	one	that	used	to	be	Rachel’s. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Sharon’s	 not	 perfect	 after	 all.	 She	 just	 made	 herself	 believe	 she	 could	 handle things.	Just	like	I	made	myself	believe	I	could	pull	this	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Joe... </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	want	nothing	to	do	with	Sharon’s	thoughts.	I	walk	out,	head	back	to</p>

<p class="calibre1">People	pass	by	my	door,	which	is	thankfully	closed.	I	hear	Carlos	so	I	click</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	of	solitaire.	I	can’t	tell	how	many	people	are	with	him,	but	I	guess	three	or</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>four.	 The	 high	 heels	 either	 Frances	 or	 Gloria.	 That	 laugh,	 all	 Alex.	 Poor	 Alex, thinking	 his	 rose	 is	 going	 to	 win	 Rachel’s	 heart.	 I	 consider	 telling	 him	 he	 can have	it.	It’s	just	sitting	in	my	closet,	inside	Rachel’s	chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carlos	and	the	 others	start	laughing,	 wanting	everyone	to	 hear	how	 happy</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 are.	 I	 open	 my	 sales	 spreadsheet	 and	 customer	 list	 so	 it	 looks	 like	 I’m working.	 I	 don’t	 even	 know	 why	 I’m	 still	 pretending,	 but	 I’m	 on	 automatic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shock	does	that	to	me.	It’s	keeping	me	from	losing	it.	I	start	rearranging	pictures of	condos	into	regions.	The	two-bedroom	with	the	kitchenette	is	South	America. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 penthouse	 with	 the	 hammocks	 on	 the	 balcony	 go	 in	 the	 Australia/New Zealand	pile.	Everything	in	its	little	place.	Everything	separated	like	Brightsiders from	normals;	Sharon’s	secret	club	and	those	better	off	in	the	Cabin.	People	like Sara	and	Danny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alex	 speaks	 way	 too	 loud,	 same	 as	 always.	 “What	 do	 you	 say,	 Carlos? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oscar’s	for	dinner?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carlos	is	right	outside	my	door.	“I	don’t	want	to	make	plans	yet,”	he	said.	“I</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	a	feeling	about	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sit	up	and	wonder	if	Carlos	is	one	of	Sharon’s	elite,	the	chosen	few	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	 to	 leave.	 I	 asked	 Sharon	 why	 not	 everyone.	 She	 said	 there	 were	 too	 many liabilities,	too	many	who’d	already	become	institutionalized.	Part	of	that	was	her fault.	 Her	 Zen	 bullshit	 actually	 convinced	 some	 of	 these	 pathetic	 souls Brightside	was	for	the	best,	that	they’d	never	want	to	leave	if	they	just	opened themselves	 up	 to	 the	 possibilities,	 the	 wonder	 of	 this	 mountain	 town.	 Sadly, that’s	exactly	what	is	going	to	happen	to	these	poor	fucks.	They’ll	never	leave, not	after	today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carlos	 knocks,	 I	 put	 the	 phone	 to	 my	 ear.	 He	 pops	 his	 head	 in,	 sees	 me nodding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“...Yes,	 right	 on	 the	 beach,	 where	 you	 can	 rent	 jet	 skis,”	 I	 say	 to	 my imaginary	client. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carlos	whispers,	“How’s	it	going?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	give	him	the	thumbs	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carlos	winks,	closes	the	door.	His	shirts	are	always	vertical	stripes.	Today’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	red,	makes	him	look	like	a	candy	cane. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 have	 to	 piss,	 but	 they’re	 all	 still	 standing	 there,	 asking	 what	 everyone’s plans	are	for	the	weekend.	I	want	to	go	out	and	say	a	few	of	us	will	be	dead	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	bottom	of	the	mountain.	Might	even	get	a	few	bullet	holes	if	we’re	up	for	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	rest	can	forget	about	sleeping	in.	They’ll	be	in	the	Cabin	soon	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	bladder’s	throbbing,	but	I	wait	until	the	laughter’s	gone.	I	take	a	peek, </p>
<p class="calibre1">see	a	clear	shot	to	the	hallway	bathroom,	start	humming	to	block	everything	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	pace	makes	me	more	conspicuous	than	if	I	set	myself	on	fire,	but	I	make	it	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>the	urinal	in	the	back	corner,	away	from	Lenny	popping	a	zit	in	the	mirror.	I	aim at	the	drain,	counting	off	random	numbers	so	I	can’t	think	about	anything	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lenny	leaves.	I	stuff	myself	back	in	my	pants,	walk	over	to	the	sinks,	and	do	my best	not	to	look	at	the	mirror.	Men	don’t	cry	in	bathrooms,	at	least	when	there’s	a chance	another	dude	might	come	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wash	my	hands	and	notice	a	small	dribble	of	blood	where	my	thumbnail</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappears	 into	 the	 skin.	 I	 scrub	 and	 scrub	 and	 scrub,	 seeing	 Rachel’s	 faceless body,	 my	 hands	 swirling	 around	 the	 contents	 of	 her	 head	 on	 the	 floor.	 When	 I take	 my	 thumb	 out	 from	 under	 the	 water,	 I	 realize	 it’s	 my	 blood,	 not	 Rachel’s, because	the	blood	dribbles	out	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	 drying	 my	 hands	 when	 Wendell,	 top	 salesman	 for	 the	 past	 three</p>
<p class="calibre1">months,	 hurries	 in,	 all	 four	 hundred	 pounds	 of	 him	 between	 me	 and	 the	 wall, saying	 excuse	 me	 as	 he	 sticks	 his	 hands	 under	 the	 faucet,	 his	 massive	 paws splashing	water	all	over	the	counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	are	three	paper	towels	left.	I	wait	for	Wendell	to	finish	and	hand	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 him,	 so	 he	 can	 finally	 take	 a	 piss.	 Wendell	 won’t	 touch	 his	 dick	 unless	 he washes	his	hands.	I	have	no	idea	why,	just	his	thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendell’s	 spraying	 the	 blue	 cake,	 thinking	 about	 the	 weekend,	 possibly</p>
<p class="calibre1">barbecuing	a	nice	burger	in	the	Brightside	park. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	no	way	Wendell’s	a	part	of	Sharon’s	plan.	I	suddenly	feel	sorry	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">him,	that	big	dumb	bear.	Stuck	here	with	all	the	rest	of	the	ones	Sharon	decided are	too	risky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendell	 still	 hates	 me	 for	 what	 happened	 at	 the	 bar	 when	 I	 let	 out	 all	 my thoughts	about	everyone,	all	my	judgments.		I	give	him	a	smile	to	apologize,	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">say	goodbye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looks	at	me	like	I’m	hitting	on	him	and	quickly	exits,	not	even	thinking</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	should	wash	after	handling	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	emergency	exit	is	down	the	hall	on	the	other	side	of	the	bathrooms.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">consider	heading	for	it,	taking	it	to	the	roof	so	I	can	perform	Paul’s	plunge,	but with	the	helicopter	still	hovering,	I	won’t	even	make	it	to	the	ledge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 is	 the	 helicopter	 Sharon	 says	 I	 have	 to	 take	 care	 of,	 as	 if	 I	 have	 any chance.	 Most	 likely,	 I’ll	 end	 up	 in	 smaller	 pieces	 than	 Rachel.	 That’s	 probably what	Sharon	wants.	After	barging	into	her	office,	I’m	proving	to	be	the	biggest</p>
<p class="calibre1">risk	of	all.	It’s	probably	just	another	part	of	Sharon’s	clusterfuck	of	a	plan,	to	use me	as	a	 scapegoat.	Everything’s	accelerated	 because	of	Wayne.	 Since	he	broke</p>
<p class="calibre1">out,	the	Boots	have	been	patrolling,	searching	for	anything	amiss,	for	his	crazy ass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sheriff	Melvin	has	disabled	a	lot	of	the	cameras,	according	to	Sharon.	It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">why	they	haven’t	found	Wayne.	It’s	buying	us	time,	just	like	all	the	bleach	in	my</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a><img src="index-140_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">room.	But	the	Boots	will	eventually	fix	the	cameras	so	we	have	to	be	ready.	A</p>
<p class="calibre1">big	 spotlight	 will	 be	 put	 on	 every	 nook	 and	 cranny.	 The	 whole	 town	 won’t	 be able	 to	 sneeze	 without	 someone	 watching.	 They’ll	 see	 us	 gathering,	 find	 the mineshaft.	 Our	 one	 dumb	 shot	 at	 escape	 will	 be	 gone,	 and	 anyone	 in	 Sharon’s special	 club	 will	 be	 locked	 away,	 some	 in	 the	 Cabin,	 the	 others	 down	 with	 the orange	jumpsuits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	and	I	will	end	up	together,	most	likely	underground.	The	rest	of	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">days	 with	 that	 fucking	 lunatic,	 who	 truly	 believes	 she’s	 a	 revolutionary.	 I	 can’t deny	she’s	been	impressive.	For	almost	two	years	she’s	integrated,	assimilated, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wedged	 her	 skinny	 butt	 into	 everything	 Brightside.	 I	 can’t	 imagine	 trying	 to pretend	for	that	long.	I	couldn’t	even	keep	Sara	from	Rachel,	couldn’t	tell	Rachel I	loved	her.	I’m	the	fucking	coward	Dad	always	warned	me	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	crazy	leads	the	men	to	battle,	but	the	coward	gets	them	killed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	not	going	to	make	it	if	I	keep	thinking	like	this.	I	have	to	stay	positive, </p>
<p class="calibre1">get	 through	 the	 day.	 That’s	 what	 Dad	 also	 said.	 “Worry	 about	 tomorrow, tomorrow.	And	if	it	doesn’t	come,	then	your	worries	are	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 can’t	 do	 anything	 but	 worry.	 It	 doesn’t	 help	 being	 trapped	 in	 my	 office, hearing	my	coworkers	out	there	bitch	about	the	coffee,	the	cold	weather,	the	lack of	selection	in	the	vending	machine.	They	have	no	idea	what’s	happening	around</p>
<p class="calibre1">them,	but	it’s	probably	for	the	best.	It’s	the	little	things	that	keep	us	from	putting a	shotgun	in	our	mouths	and	blowing	out	our	wonderfully	gifted	brains. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	 what	 I’m	 thinking	 as	 the	 clock	 refuses	 to	 budge.	 Rachel	 ran	 out	 of distractions,	 the	 inconsequential	 crap	 that	 keeps	 us	 from	 seeing	 how	 awful	 our lives	really	are.	She	knew	I	didn’t	love	her,	that	no	one	ever	would,	not	like	she needed.	So	she	took	control,	found	the	only	foolproof	way	out	of	Brightside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	keep	picturing	the	night	I	visited	Rachel	in	the	Cabin,	her	sitting	there	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">quiet	and	peaceful,	each	moment	a	gentle	breeze.	Not	like	now,	the	wind	gone, </p>
<p class="calibre1">everything	still,	Rachel	shoved	in	next	to	Dad’s	broken	fishing	pole. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Broken	Rachel,	broken	gifts.	I	just	can’t	stop	breaking	things.	It’s	what	I	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes,	 Rachel	 was	 broken	 when	 I	 met	 her.	 Then	 the	 Cabin	 broke	 her	 more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	had	to	go	and	finish	the	job. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next,	 it’ll	 be	 Sara.	 Then	 Danny.	 Stupid,	 happy	 Danny,	 the	 only	 person who’s	 truly	 able	 to	 find	 good	 in	 anything.	 But	 the	 Cabin	 will	 end	 that.	 They’ll inject	 him,	 make	 him	 swallow	 the	 meds,	 and	 they’ll	 kill	 the	 only	 spirit	 in Brightside	worth	saving.	The	idea	of	them	destroying	that	gets	me	to	my	feet.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	have	an	hour	left	of	work.	Carlos	might	call	the	Boots,	but	fuck	it.	Let	them sound	the	alarm.	This	is	the	only	chance	I’ve	got	to	make	things	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a>THE	WIND	CUTS	ACROSS	my	face	and	makes	my	eyes	water,	so	it	looks	like I’m	 crying	 as	 I	 walk	 through	 the	 Square.	 I	 have	 my	 headphones	 on	 and	 the people	 I	 pass	 think	 I’m	 on	 one	 of	 my	 strange	 walks,	 only	 now	 I’m	 apparently working	 out	 to	 music	 that	 makes	 me	 weep.	 I	 don’t	 care.	 I	 just	 need	 to	 get	 to Danny,	need	to	tell	him	to	talk	some	sense	into	his	sister.	He’s	the	only	one	who can	 get	 through	 to	 her.	 I’m	 sure	 he’s	 scared	 right	 now	 as	 Sara	 tells	 him	 she’s going	to	the	Cabin.	She’s	probably	telling	him	to	be	strong,	that	it’s	the	only	way they	can	get	through	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lodge	Two	is	just	up	ahead.	I	start	to	slow	my	pace.	There’s	a	car	parked</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	front,	and	an	ambulance.	I’m	too	late.	I	start	running.	I	can	imagine	Danny</p>
<p class="calibre1">fighting	off	the	Boots	trying	to	protect	his	sister.	I	see	the	gun	pressed	to	the	side of	 his	 head,	 him	 screaming	 for	 Sara	 as	 they	 drag	 her	 from	 the	 room.	 I	 see	 the Boots	crushing	his	ribs,	kicking	in	his	belly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 as	 I	 rush	 in,	 there’s	 only	 one	 person	 in	 the	 hallway.	 Blue	 jeans	 and black	windbreaker,	cell	phone	to	his	ear.	He’s	pacing	outside	of	a	room	near	the stairs,	the	opposite	end	of	Danny	and	Sara’s	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	usually	stay	away	from	the	Boots,	but	this	guy’s	young	and	doesn’t	look</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	dangerous	with	his	aw-shucks	face.	Plus,	morbid	curiosity	is	all	I	seem	to	be seeking	these	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pass	the	elevator	when	he	turns	my	way.	He	holds	the	phone	to	his	chest</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	points	over	my	shoulder.	“You	need	to	turn	around.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve	never	seen	him	before,	but	it’s	obvious	he’s	weirded	out.	Whatever	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	room	isn’t	good.	I	walk	closer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 guy	 tries	 to	 use	 his	 big	 boy	 voice.	 “Did	 you	 not	 hear	 me?	 I	 said	 turn around.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stop	four	feet	from	him,	close	enough	to	know	he	isn’t	counting	numbers</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	singing	songs.	He	can’t	get	the	image	of	the	rope	out	of	his	head,	the	rope	on the	other	side	of	the	door.	I	nod	past	him.	“Whose	room	is	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“None	of	your	damn	business.”	He’s	not	good	at	this	and	thinks	of	Robert. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 reach	 for	 the	 door	 and	 he	 jumps	 back	 like	 I’m	 attacking.	 His	 right	 hand slips	 inside	 his	 jacket.	 “Stay	 back.”	 This	 poor	 kid’s	 shaking,	 has	 no	 idea	 what he’s	 doing.	 He’s	 scared,	 and	 it’s	 going	 to	 get	 me	 shot.	 Light	 reflects	 off	 his wedding	 band	 a	 few	 inches	 below	 the	 gun’s	 barrel.	 “D-d-don’t	 take	 another step.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	voice	gets	real	calm,	like	I’m	trying	to	put	him	to	sleep.	“I	know	him,”	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">say.	“You	don’t	need	to	point	that	at	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	starts	counting	to	himself,	just	like	they	trained	him,	to	keep	us	out	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	loop.	He	realizes	he	looks	like	an	idiot	aiming	at	a	shithead	like	me	and	his fear	gets	washed	out	by	embarrassment.	“Calm	down,	sir,”	he	says,	even	though</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>I’m	the	calmest	I’ve	been	in	months. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	a	situation	here,”	he	says,	“and	you	don’t	need	to	see	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	should’ve		kept	my	goddamn	mouth	shut,	but	still	said,	“I	just	saw	Robert</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	morning.”	There’s	no	reason	for	me	to	be	here	at	all.	I	came	here	for	Danny, not	Robert. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guy	sees	my	nerves	showing	and	tells	me	to	wait.	He	says	he’ll	be	right</p>
<p class="calibre1">back,	slips	into	Robert’s	room.	I	think	about	running,	but	if	I	do,	I	might	as	well just	 run	 straight	 to	 the	 Cabin.	 I	 need	 to	 just	 stick,	 see	 whatever	 is	 behind	 that door,	start	crying,	act	like	I’m	getting	sick,	then	leave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 guy	 didn’t	 close	 the	 door	 behind	 him.	 I	 see	 a	 shadow	 swaying	 across the	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hear	a	voice.	“Who	saw	him?”	It’s	Palmer,	the	asshole	who	put	the	gun	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	head,	the	fucker	who	wants	to	finish	the	job.	I’m	already	turning,	realize	I’ve made	a	huge	mistake,	when	Palmer’s	dirty	fingers	grab	the	door,	his	face,	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">mirrored	sunglasses	pointed	straight	at	me.	“What’s	this	all	about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	have	no	choice	but	to	turn	around.	Palmer	sees	me	and	that	creepy	smile</p>
<p class="calibre1">spreads	across	his	acne-scarred	cheeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	I	help	you?”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	I	just...”  <i class="calibre4">The	truth.	Just	stick	to	the	truth. </i>	“I	saw	Robert	yesterday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	you	said	this	morning?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	did,	but	I	meant	yesterday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palmer	lowers	his	sunglasses,	studies	me.	I’ve	made	such	a	swamp	of	shit</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	keep	diving	deeper	and	deeper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,”	 I	 say,	 “Robert	 was	 talking	 about	 Wayne	 King.	 He	 said	 he	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	to	find	him.	He...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	opened	a	little	more	and	the	smell	of	actual	shit	hit	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	pretty	nasty	stuff.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palmer	opened	the	door	all	the	way.	He	wanted	me	to	see.	Wanted	to	look</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	in	the	eyes	when	I	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 newbie	 stood	 a	 few	 feet	 from	 the	 window,	 the	 wooden	 chair	 lying</p>
<p class="calibre1">across	the	kitchen	floor,	the	giant	square	of	plastic	right	in	the	center.	The	puddle of	piss	and	shit	on	top	of	it.	He	was	thinking	Palmer	was	the	coldest	dude	he’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever	worked	with,	worse	than	his	uncle	that	used	to	show	him	snuff	films. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	don’t	know	why,	but	I’m	walking	in	the	room.	Robert	must	have	learned</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 Belinda,	 who	 fell	 from	 the	 fan	 when	 it	 couldn’t	 hold	 her	 weight.	 He	 cut away	 a	 section	 of	 sheetrock	 in	 the	 ceiling.	 One	 end	 of	 the	 rope	 is	 wrapped around	a	two-by-four,	the	other	around	his	black	turtleneck,	covering	that	hole	in his	 throat.	 He’s	 swinging	 with	 his	 back	 to	 me.	 Palmer	 looks	 at	 me	 and	 pokes Robert	in	the	ribs	with	his	small	baton,	sends	Robert	swinging	a	few	inches. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>Kind	of	low,	Palmer	says,	“So	when	did	you	see	him	last?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yesterday.	He	was	looking	for	Wayne.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Robert’s	 black	 microphone	 is	 dangling	 off	 the	 kitchen	 counter,	 no	 final words	from	Robert. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	know	about	Wayne	King?”	Palmer	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 quietly	 remembered	 the	 first	 time	 I	 saw	 Wayne.	 It	 was	 after	 Krystal	 had kicked	me	out	and	I	was	thinking	about	Mom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palmer’s	smile	somehow	gets	creepier.	There’s	no	way	a	Boot	could	be	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	us,	but	I	wasn’t	taking	any	chances.	In	case	he	was	listening,	I	keep	thinking about	 Wayne,	 about	 my	 mom,	 about	 Krystal.	 As	 disgusting	 as	 it	 is,	 it	 wasn’t going	to	get	me	in	trouble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Robert	 spins.	 His	 face	 is	 bigger	 than	 I	 remember,	 his	 skin	 all	 puffed	 out, tinged	 the	 lightest	 blue.	 Just	 like	 his	 eyes,	 wide	 open,	 squiggly	 red	 lines surrounding	them.	But	it’s	his	tongue	that	paralyzes	me.	It’s	so	big,	pushed	out all	the	way,	the	tip	halfway	down	his	chin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palmer’s	walkie-talkie	goes	off,	but	he	keeps	staring	at	me,	waiting	for	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	slip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Palmer,	 where	 the	 hell	 are	 you?”	 a	 voice	 says.	 It	 sounds	 like	 Sheriff Melvin,	but	I	can’t	be	sure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palmer’s	 jaw	 clenches,	 that	 muscle	 just	 below	 the	 ear	 flexing	 like	 a	 little tumor.	 Finally,	 he	 answers.	 “Investigating	 the	 Madison	 case.”	 	 He	 wants	 me	 to know	I’m	not	going	anywhere.	“I	got	Joe	Nolan	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Melvin	tells	him	they	think	they’ve	got	a	location	on	Wayne	King,	that	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">needs	to	get	his	ass	over	to	the	Square. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palmer’s	still	staring	at	me	and	I’m	just	humming,	trying	to	plug	the	leaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">boat	 I	 call	 a	 brain.	 I’m	 trying	 not	 to	 think	 about	 Melvin,	 Sharon,	 her	 fortunate few. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	close	my	eyes,	breathe	in	the	shit	and	piss	puddle	under	Robert’s	swinging</p>
<p class="calibre1">feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 newbie	 runs	 over	 to	 Palmer	 and	 accidentally	 bumps	 Robert,	 sending</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	swinging	again,	spinning	him	like	a	giant	marionette.	This	time	another	drop of	piss	lands	on	the	floor,	right	next	to	my	foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 newbie	 just	 wants	 to	 get	 out	 of	 there.	 He	 says	 I	 obviously	 didn’t	 do this,	that	they	need	to	get	to	the	Square. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palmer	extends	his	baton	with	a	snap	of	his	wrist.	“You	got	five	seconds	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell	me	what	happened	here,”	he	says	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 can’t	 look	 at	 Palmer	 anymore.	 I	 stare	 at	 Robert	 spinning.	 And	 I	 don’t know	how	in	the	hell	I	didn’t	notice	it	before,	the	front	of	Robert’s	briefs	poking out,	his	little	boner	all	that’s	left	to	say	hello. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>“You	really	don’t	know?”	I	ask,	suddenly	kind	of	cocky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palmer	 tilts	 his	 head,	 knows	 I’m	 hiding	 something,	 but	 Melvin	 is	 telling him	 to	 hurry.	 Palmer	 pokes	 me	 with	 the	 baton.	 “I’ll	 be	 seeing	 you	 real	 soon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Count	on	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	keep	humming,	staring	at	Robert’s	face,	all	big	and	blue. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	FIFTEEN</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">IN	 TWENTY-EIGHT	 YEARS,	 I’ve	 seen	 death.	 Lily	 and	 Sunny,	 the	 countless</p>
<p class="calibre1">fish	that	died	in	the	hands	of	my	father.	And	all	the	loved	ones	that	people	carry around	in	their	heads.	Their	parents,	war	buddies,	their	best	friend	from	college. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I’d	never	seen	human	death	in	person.	I’d	never	been	face-to-face	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	human	corpse.	Steven,	my	first	real	friend,	was	dying,	not	dead,	and	when	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">passed,	 I	 only	 saw	 the	 casket,	 his	 school	 picture.	 Not	 like	 the	 past	 twenty-four hours.	Robert	and	Rachel.	Two	people	who	made	the	mistake	of	coming	into	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	question.	Rachel	was	my	fault,	and	even	though	I	don’t	have	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">hard	proof,	I’m	sure	Robert’s	death	is	also	on	me.	Robert	heard	my	thoughts	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">escape,	knew	about	my	plans.	I	didn’t	know	him	very	well,	but	I	can’t	believe	he took	his	own	life,	even	by	accident.	One	final	jerk-off	before	his	hunt	for	Wayne King.	 Wayne	 must	 have	 set	 up	 his	 death,	 made	 it	 look	 like	 some	 perverted attempt	to	get	off	that	simply	went	awry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Robert’s	black	microphone	keeps	flashing	in	my	mind	as	I	walk	out	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">room.	It	looked	like	it’d	been	thrown,	ripped	out	of	Robert’s	hand,	the	red	burn line	on	his	lifeless	palm.	Robert	probably	tried	to	call	out	for	help	when	the	man he	was	hunting	simply	showed	up	at	his	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	have	no	idea	why,	but	it’s	the	only	reason	I	can	find. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	heading	to	Danny’s	room.	My	footsteps	slow	and	staggered.	His	door	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">cracked	open,	and	I	fear	Wayne	has	gotten	to	him	as	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny’s	 door	 is	 third	 on	 the	 right.	 I	 force	 it	 open,	 waiting	 to	 see	 Danny hanging	there	like	Robert.	I	call	out	Danny’s	name,	but	it’s	so	quiet,	I	know	he couldn’t	hear	me,	even	if	he’s	alive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	step	inside,	eyes	straight	ahead,	every	inch	of	the	far	wall	covered	with	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">drawings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	kitchen	is	the	same,	the	fridge	displaying	my	first	drawings.	Billy	Bass, </p>
<p class="calibre1">mouth	open,	sits	on	the	counter	next	to	an	angel	food	cake.	My	favorite.	A	sign</p>
<p class="calibre1">below	it,	Danny’s	scribble,	CHEER	UP	JOE	inside	a	happy	face.	The	cake	looks</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	 it’s	 been	 here	 for	 a	 while	 so	 I	 know	 it	 has	 nothing	 to	 do	 with	 Rachel	 or Robert	or	any	of	the	other	fucked	up	shit	I’ve	just	been	through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	walk	to	the	counter,	tears	falling	down	my	face,	onto	the	drawing	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">small	 boy	 escaping	 through	 the	 wall.	 Danny	 added	 two	 large	 arrows	 on	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a><img src="index-146_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">picture,	names	next	to	each	one.	Danny	is	the	little	boy,	Joe	for	the	hand	pulling him	through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I’ve	failed.	Danny	and	Sara	are	already	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	 suddenly	 on	 the	 floor,	 looking	 at	 everything,	 at	 nothing.	 I’m	 too	 late. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’ve	taken	them,	and	there’s	nothing	I	can	do.	Even	if	I	somehow	break	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Cabin,	I’m	only	locking	myself	in.	They’ll	never	let	me	leave	with	Sara	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny.	We’ll	all	be	in	there	when	Sharon’s	exodus	goes	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	watch	says	I	have	less	than	an	hour.	That’s	when	the	sun’s	going	to	set</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	Sharon’s	club	will	be	filing	down	the	mineshaft	on	their	way	to	freedom.	At</p>
<p class="calibre1">least	that’s	the	plan.	I’m	supposed	to	take	care	of	the	helicopter.	If	I	don’t,	no	one will	make	it	out	alive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	fuck	them.	I’m	not	moving.	My	only	two	reasons	are	locked	away,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	 Danny	 and	 Sara	 can’t	 escape,	 then	 no	 one	 should,	 especially	 Sharon,	 the woman	Dad	trusted	enough	to	turn	me	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">IT	WAS	BEFORE	I	MET	Michelle,	a	year	before	Brightside.	I’d	just	broken	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	Chloe,	this	waitress	I’d	been	dating	for	about	six	months.	Chloe	never	liked me,	thought	I	was	annoying,	and	knowing	this,	I	just	became	more	annoying	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">piss	her	off.	I	thought	it	was	funny.	She’d	get	so	red	and	flustered,	and	would	tug at	her	hair	until	it	tore	free	from	her	scalp.	I	listened	to	her	thoughts,	figured	out exactly	 what	 bothered	 her	 the	 most.	 Then	 I’d	 perform	 each	 one	 to	 watch	 her squirm.	I	drummed	my	fork	on	the	dinner	plate,	just	like	her	brother	used	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	scratch	my	scalp	like	her	stepfather	did	every	morning	at	breakfast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 was	 bored,	 destructive,	 pissed	 off	 at	 the	 world.	 I	 was	 so	 tired	 of	 hearing everyone’s	 thoughts,	 knowing	 I’d	 never	 find	 love,	 because	 I’d	 always	 get	 the truth.	 That’s	 why	 I	 set	 fires,	 wanted	 to	 watch	 these	 assholes	 burn.	 People	 like Chloe,	who	never	deserved	it.	Finally,	she	had	enough	and	moved	out.	She	never</p>
<p class="calibre1">told	me,	but	I	knew	all	about	the	abortion.	It	wasn’t	a	tough	decision.	She	knew I’d	make	a	terrible	father,	wanted	nothing	to	do	with	me	ever	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	 what	 sent	 me	 into	 the	 darkness<b class="calibre3">, </b>the	 bleakest	 state	 I	 found	 until Brightside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chloe	had	been	gone	for	a	week,	and	Dad	showed	up	because	I	hadn’t	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">answering	his	calls.	He	found	me	in	the	living	room	just	sitting	in	my	underwear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unshaven,	filthy.	Plates	of	dried	food	everywhere.	Lily	licking	at	the	scraps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jesus	Christ,	Joe,”	Dad	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	must	have	left	the	door	unlocked	because	he	was	just	standing	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	the	hell	happened	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a>I	went	back	to	watching	Lily	lick	the	dried	rice	and	beans.	Dad	picked	up the	plate,	told	Lily	to	stop.	He	stacked	a	few	dishes,	put	them	out	of	her	reach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	 said	 my	 name,	 but	 I	 couldn’t	 look	 at	 him,	 knew	 if	 I	 did,	 I’d	 start crying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	Dad	I	didn’t	need	to	speak.	He	knew	everything,	about	Chloe,	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 abortion.	 He	 cleared	 off	 some	 space	 on	 the	 couch	 and	 sat,	 neither	 of	 us saying	a	word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know,”	Dad	said,	“your	mother	and	I	considered...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,”	I	said.	I’d	heard	Mom	thinking	it	more	than	once,	how	she	should</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	just	ended	the	pregnancy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	mom	couldn’t	do	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	finally	turned.	I’d	always	assumed	it	was	Dad	who’d	talked	her	out	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 were	 at	 the	 doctor’s,	 already	 in	 the	 examination	 room,	 and	 she	 just couldn’t	do	it.	We	both	knew	you	might	turn	out	like	me,	but	she	didn’t	care.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	 pictured	 the	 first	 time	 he	 held	 me	 in	 his	 arms.	 “And	 then	 you	 showed	 up, and	I	knew	you	were	meant	to	be	here.	That	you’d	do	great	things	one	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 wreckage	 of	 my	 life	 suddenly	 came	 into	 focus.	 The	 dirty	 clothes,	 the sacks	of	fast	food	wrappers,	the	half-empty	bottle	of	whiskey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Guess	you	were	wrong,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	 Dad	 said,	 “I	 wasn’t.	 You	 just	 need	 to	 pull	 yourself	 together,	 stop feeling	sorry	for	yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	that’s	all	I	need	to	do.”	I	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	 grabbed	 my	 face	 and	 squeezed	 my	 chin,	 forced	 my	 eyes	 to	 his.	 “You want	to	destroy	yourself,	go	ahead.	But	there	are	people	out	there	who	could	use your	help.	You	can	still	do	great	things,	Joe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	don’t	remember	exactly	what	was	said	after	that.	I	know	I	didn’t	want	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear	 his	 pep	 talk,	 knew	 I	 just	 wanted	 him	 gone.	 He	 finally	 left	 and	 I	 sat	 back down	on	the	couch.	Lily	crawled	over	and	plopped	down	on	my	feet.	She	needed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 be	 walked,	 and	 while	 nothing	 inside	 me	 wanted	 to	 see	 the	 outside	 world,	 I took	her	around	the	block.	Dad’s	words	started	to	sink	in.	My	dog	needed	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 next	 day	 I	 went	 into	 BMW	 and	 convinced	 Saul	 to	 hire	 me.	 A	 few</p>
<p class="calibre1">weeks	later	I	met	Michelle.	The	money	poured	in,	and	even	though	I	knew	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">father	was	wrong,	that	I’d	never	do	anything	great,	I	thought	I	was	at	least	doing some	 good.	 I	 was	 going	 to	 buy	 a	 house	 with	 a	 big	 yard	 for	 Lily.	 I	 told	 myself Michelle	would	accept	the	truth,	that	things	would	work	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 Dad	 paid	 Michelle	 that	 visit,	 learned	 she’d	 never	 accept	 who	 I	 was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	must	have	known	I’d	crumble,	just	like	I	had	with	Chloe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	the	only	reason	I	could	come	up	with.	That	Dad	sent	me	here	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	was	too	late. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a>He	must	have	believed	this	was	the	only	way	for	me	to	reach	my	potential. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	only	he	could	see	me	now,	sitting	on	Danny’s	floor,	pathetically	weeping</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	Rachel	and	Robert,	the	guy	I	barely	knew.	Weeping	for	Danny	and	Sara,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	people	here	worth	saving.	Everyone	dead	or	locked	away	because	of	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grandpa’s	shotgun	flashes	in	my	head.	The	gift	my	father	sent	in	pieces,	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">puzzle	like	my	Rubik’s	Cube.	I	had	to	go	and	solve	it	so	Rachel	could	blow	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe,”	a	voice	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	sounds	like	Sara,	and	I	figure	I	must	already	be	in	the	Cabin.	They	must</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	found	the	body	in	my	closet.	But	I	don’t	remember	them	taking	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara’s	face	is	right	in	front	of	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 slap	 stings	 too	 much	 for	 the	 medication	 I	 must	 be	 on.	 It	 sends	 little crackles	up	and	down	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s	Danny?”	she	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	not	in	the	Cabin,	still	in	the	room	with	all	my	sketches.	Danny’s	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara’s	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was	he	here?”	she	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	just	about	screams,	“Was	Danny	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	The	door.	It	was	open.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	paces	back	and	forth,	says,	“Shit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	get	to	my	feet	and	ask	what’s	going	on,	why	she’s	not	in	the	Cabin.	Sara</p>
<p class="calibre1">says	she	went	looking	for	Danny,	but	he	wasn’t	at	work.	He	didn’t	even	show	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ve	already	got	him,”	I	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	she	already	knows.	“Why?	They	said	they	were	only	taking	me!	Danny</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t	do	anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	Sharon.	She	wanted	him	out	of	the	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara’s	 head	 shakes	 back	 and	 forth,	 like	 she’s	 trying	 to	 get	 rid	 of	 every horrible	thought.	She	has	Sharon’s	throat	in	her	hands,	crunching	her	windpipe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 think	 of	 Robert,	 the	 rope	 digging	 deeper,	 his	 face	 turning	 purple,	 his tongue	dangling	down	like	he	was	trying	to	get	a	crumb	off	his	chin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	turns	to	me	disgusted.	She	hadn’t	needed	all	of	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	try	to	apologize,	but	she	wants	to	know	what	the	hell	is	going	on.	I	tell	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 don’t	 know.	 I	 touch	 her	 arm,	 expecting	 her	 to	 push	 me	 away,	 but	 she	 just collapses,	 huge	 sobs	 filling	 the	 air.	 Her	 mind	 only	 on	 Danny,	 the	 brother	 she swore	she’d	protect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	the	shove	comes.	Then	her	tiny	fists	ball	up	and	beat	at	my	chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>“YOU	DID	THIS	TO	HIM!	YOU!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	take	each	blow,	wishing	she	were	stronger,	wishing	her	fists	were	holding</p>
<p class="calibre1">knives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	can’t...”	Sara’s	picturing	a	catatonic	Danny,	the	joy	completely	drained</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	his	eyes.	“I	have	to	go,”	she	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	hand	is	around	her	wrist.	She’s	pulling	away,	but	I	grip	harder,	yank	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">back.	“You	go	there,	and	you	won’t	be	able	to	do	anything.	They’ll	do	the	same</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	care.	I’ll	be	with	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sara,	no.	They’ll	never	let	you	leave.	You	know	too	much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hear	Sara	thinking	before	she	even	says	it.	“Then	I’ll	tell	them	everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ll	tell	them	and	they’ll	have	to	let	us	go.	They’ll	know	Danny	and	I...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Part	of	me	wants	her	to	do	exactly	that,	to	put	a	stop	to	Sharon’s	plans,	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">end	all	this	before	we	all	end	up	comatose	or	dead.	But	I	remember	what	Sharon</p>
<p class="calibre1">said,	that	Brightside	couldn’t	last	forever.	It’s	not	sustainable,	and	sooner	or	later, the	funds	would	run	out	and	they’ll	have	no	choice	but	to	eradicate	us.	They’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">say	it’s	what’s	best	for	the	country,	the	normals	will	never	know	the	truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	know	Sara	thinks	a	little	time	is	better	than	none,	but	there	is	another	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	can	break	Danny	out	and	make	the	escape	on	our	own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tell	Sara	to	wait	by	the	pond,	that	I’ll	handle	everything.	Sara	refuses,	says she’s	 coming	 with	 me.	 I	 tell	 her	 fine,	 but	 we	 have	 to	 stop	 by	 my	 place	 first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’re	going	to	need	Dad’s	gift. </p>

<p class="calibre1">SARA	 MAKES	 ME	 PROMISE	 I’ll	 turn	 myself	 in	 if	 Danny	 has	 already	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">drugged.	 She	 says	 we’ll	 never	 get	 him	 out	 of	 there.	 Medicated,	 he’ll	 be	 too heavy.	I	tell	her	I	will,	but	I’m	still	thinking	of	other	options,	thinking	about	the ambulance,	 how	 we	 could	 steal	 it,	 load	 him	 up,	 drive	 right	 out.	 But	 the Brightside	 entrance	 is	 locked	 by	 a	 steel	 gate	 that	 not	 even	 Sheriff	 Melvin	 has access	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	exit	Lodge	Two	and	I	see	the	helicopter	hovering	over	the	Square.	I’m</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	sun	is	falling	and	it’s	blinding	on	the	way	to	my	place.	I	can	barely	see</p>

<p class="calibre1">Still,	Sara	wants	it	to	work.	She	wants	Danny	to	be	free,	to	have	a	life,	to	be</p>

<p class="calibre1">There	aren’t	any	Boots	outside	my	building.	The	place	is	quiet,	almost	too</p>
<p class="calibre1">quiet.	Everyone	is	at	work,	all	that	remains	are	the	smells,	especially	the	bleach growing	stronger	as	we	near	my	door.	The	bleach	covering	Rachel. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The	 Boots	 must	 be	 in	 there.	 I	 start	 to	 tell	 Sara	 to	 run,	 but	 she’s	 stepping towards	the	open	door.	There’s	something	on	the	floor,	just	inside	my	apartment. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Sara	 asks	 who’s	 there,	 but	 I	 know	 that	 gravelly	 voice	 coming	 from	 my couch.	It’s	the	sound	of	insanity,	of	someone	who	has	seen	far	more	death	than</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	 next	 sound	 is	 just	 as	 familiar.	 I’ve	 heard	 it	 since	 I	 was	 a	 kid.	 The shotgun	being	racked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	going	to	tell	you	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	reach	out	for	Sara,	but	she’s	moved.	I	can’t	see	anything,	know	the	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	to	find	her	is	to	either	rip	open	the	drapes	or	close	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let	in	the	light	or	adjust	to	the	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	drapes	are	too	far	and	I	hear	Sara’s	panicked	breaths.	I	close	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly,	my	eyes	gain	focus.	Shapes,	faces,	the	apartment	spread	out	before	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	sits	there	on	the	couch,	shotgun	resting	on	his	lap.	He	looks	at	Sara</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	says,	“You	must	be	Loverboy’s	new	gal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s	my	brother?	Is	he	here?	If	you’ve	hurt	him...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	safe,”	Wayne	says,	“for	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	me	where	he	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	smiles,	looks	to	me.	“Bossy	like	your	mom,	huh?	You	do	have	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">type,	don’t	you,	Loverboy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	me	or	I’ll	scream,”	Sara	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	 laughs,	 the	 sort	 of	 cackle	 I	 imagine	 his	 victims	 heard	 before	 he drove	 in	 the	 knife.	 But	 Sara	 isn’t	 backing	 down	 so	 Wayne	 lets	 us	 hear	 his thoughts,	 how	 he	 found	 Danny	 in	 their	 room,	 how	 he	 didn’t	 have	 to	 touch	 a single	hair	on	that	boy’s	head,	simply	told	Danny	if	he	wanted	to	see	his	sister again	 he	 needed	 to	 follow.	 Danny	 obeyed,	 followed	 Wayne	 right	 out	 the	 door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	ends	it	there,	not	letting	us	know	where	he	took	Danny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	we’d	come	over	to	his	house	to	play	cards,	Wayne	says,	“Why	don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	both	have	a	seat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	says	she’s	fine,	but	I	take	her	arm,	guide	her	to	a	chair.	Pissing	Wayne</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	isn’t	going	to	get	Danny	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 actually	 start	 wishing	 Danny	 was	 in	 the	 Cabin.	 It’s	 better	 than	 this.	 At least	we’d	know	he	was	still	alive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	 removes	 one	 of	 his	 hands	 off	 the	 shotgun,	 scratches	 at	 his	 beard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 really	 should	 take	 better	 care	 of	 your	 place,	 Joe.	 You’re	 kind	 of	 a	 slob.	 I mean,	just	cramming	everything	into	the	closet	like	that.	It’s	lazy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel... </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	suppose	Mommy	used	to	clean	up	after	you.	I	never	had	that	luxury.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>I	 ask	 Wayne	 what	 he	 wants	 and	 immediately	 regret	 it	 when	 he	 starts smacking	his	lips.	I	tell	him,	“We	just	want	Danny	back.	That’s	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 you’ll	 get	 him.	 Unharmed.	 Mostly.”	 Wayne	 waits	 for	 Sara	 to	 speak her	violent	mind,	but	I	touch	her	arm.	Wayne	is	loving	this	too	much.	Silence	is our	only	option. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	 Wayne	 gets	 bored,	 lifts	 the	 shotgun,	 aims	 it	 at	 me	 then	 Sara,	 then back	at	me.	I	close	my	eyes,	suddenly	more	fed	up	than	Sara. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	do	it,”	I	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	shouts	my	name.  <i class="calibre4">What	the	hell	you	doing? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	if	he	wants	to	pull	the	trigger,	fine.	But	he’ll	never	make	it	out	of	here</p>
<p class="calibre1">alive.	He	knows	that.	Don’t	you,	Wayne?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 let	 this	 hang	 in	 the	 air	 until	 it	 lands.	 I	 hear	 Wayne	 shifting	 in	 his	 seat, suddenly	 paying	 attention	 to	 every	 word	 out	 of	 my	 mouth.	 “It’s	 why	 he	 staged Robert’s	 death	 the	 way	 he	 did.	 He’s	 trying	 to	 draw	 attention,	 keep	 everyone busy.	 He’s	 trying	 to	 get	 out	 of	 here,	 just	 like	 us.	 And	 if	 he	 fires	 the	 gun,	 that deafening	blast,	it’s	all	over	and	he	knows	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rachel	did	it,”	Wayne	says,	“and	no	one	came	running.	Not	a	single	soul.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	figure	the	storm	covered	the	noise,	but	his	grin	says	there’s	more	to	it	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">that.	“And	that’s	why	you	killed	Sheila,”	I	say,	not	really	knowing,	but	trying	to put	this	together.	“You	killed	her	to	distract	everyone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	would	I	do	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	knew	what	Rachel	was	going	to	do.	You	must	have	heard	her	thoughts</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	she	left	the	office.	You	must	have—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	Loverboy,	then	why	didn’t	I	stop	her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	you’re	a	sick	bastard.	Two	deaths	were	better	than	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	have	no	idea	why	my	mouth	won’t	close.	I’m	not	a	detective.	I	don’t	even</p>
<p class="calibre1">know	if	any	of	it’s	true,	but	my	heart’s	racing	like	I’m	jacked	on	caffeine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne’s	teeth	click.	“Loverboy’s	using	his	big	brain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	satisfaction	of	being	right	is	erased	when	Sara	thinks	what	an	asshole	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">am.	What	is	this	accomplishing? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	ask	Wayne	what	he	wants.	“You	obviously	came	here	for	a	reason,	and	it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	just	the	shotgun.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne’s	smiling	again,	pushing	out	his	lower	lip	like	a	little	kid.	“I	wanna</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	in	your	club,	Joe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon’s	 chosen	 ones.	 The	 lucky	 group	 I’ve	 somehow	 joined.	 Seems</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	has	been	 eavesdropping,	listening	to	 more	people	than	 me.	Who	knows</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	he’s	been	lurking? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	a	small	town,”	Wayne	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	realize	Wayne	could’ve	escaped	the	moment	he	broke	out,	but	he	knows</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>he	can’t	last,	not	with	the	helicopter,	not	with	every	Boot	on	his	trail.	He	learned Sheriff	 Melvin	 had	 disabled	 most	 of	 the	 cameras	 or	 put	 them	 on	 a	 loop	 of	 old footage.	But	it	won’t	last.	He	knows	the	only	way	off	this	mountain	is	with	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">help,	 because	 Sharon	 isn’t	 going	 to	 let	 him	 join	 in.	 Her	 club	 obviously	 has	 a better	way	down	the	two	hundred	foot	drop	than	my	stupid	rope.	They	probably</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	a	getaway	car.	Sharon	didn’t	tell	me,	but	I	figured	the	same.	Still,	Wayne’s here	because	I’m	the	only	one	who	can	get	him	in	with	Sharon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	feel	special,	Momma’s	Boy?”	Wayne	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s	trying	to	intimidate	me,	but	he’s	already	shown	his	cards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	would	I	help	you?”	I	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	save	that	Bob	Dole	retard,	of	course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	can	hear	Sara’s	teeth	digging	into	her	tongue,	that	squishy	sound	of	saliva</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	slow	trickle	of	blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	ask,	“How	do	I	know	you	won’t	just—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kill	him?”	Wayne	cocks	his	head.	“You	don’t	know.	Hell,	I	could	kill	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">three	of	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	start	humming	to	drown	out	the	bad	thoughts,	the	ones	of	Sara	and	Danny, </p>
<p class="calibre1">both	faceless,	both	piled	on	top	of	Rachel	like	some	expired	orgy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	stands,	his	nose	blowing	puffs	like	a	weary	Grizzly.	He	knows	we’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasting	 time,	 that	 if	 we	 can’t	 come	 to	 an	 agreement,	 we’re	 all	 fucked.	 So	 he tosses	me	the	gun.	I	can	barely	see	in	the	dark,	but	somehow	catch	it.	My	first</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	is	to	aim,	pull	the	trigger,	end	this	piece	of	shit’s	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	says,	“Remember,	it’ll	be	loud,	Loverboy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still,	my	finger	finds	the	trigger,	my	left	hand	under	the	pump,	the	grooves, </p>
<p class="calibre1">everything	Dad	taught	me.	Never	be	afraid	to	fire	the	shot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	 stepping	 closer,	 the	 hollow	 end	 only	 a	 foot	 from	 Wayne’s	 chest,	 but Wayne	doesn’t	flinch,	his	nose	breaths	still	coming	at	the	same	steady	rate.	The gun’s	 getting	 slick.	 My	 hand’s	 sweating.	 I	 start	 to	 feel	 my	 finger	 slide	 off	 the trigger.	I’m	worried	if	I	adjust,	I’ll	crack	off	the	shot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara’s	 hand	 gently	 touches	 the	 barrel,	 forces	 me	 to	 lower	 the	 gun.  <i class="calibre4">We’ll</i> <i class="calibre4">never	 find	 Danny	 if	 Wayne’s	 dead.	 He	 could	 be	 locked	 away	 somewhere</i> <i class="calibre4">suffocating.	We	need	him	just	as	he	needs	us.	At	least	for	now. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen	to	your	girlfriend,	Joe,”	Wayne	says.	“She’s	smart.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Firing	 would	 sound	 the	 alarm,	 send	 the	 Boots	 storming,	 but	 I	 can’t	 let Wayne	 just	 walk	 away	 without	 a	 nick.	 My	 trigger	 finger	 slides	 off	 and	 back towards	the	butt,	my	hand	gripping	the	wood,	which	I	crack	into	Wayne’s	chin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stumbles	back,	bends	over,	almost	drops	to	a	knee,	but	stays	on	his	feet.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">laughs,	spits	blood	all	over	the	floor.	He	slurps	up	the	rest	and	that	laugh	of	his comes	back,	but	only	for	a	second.	It’s	followed	by	this	icy	stare,	the	“I’m	going</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a><img src="index-154_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">to	fucking	love	watching	your	girlfriend	squeal	under	my	knife”	kind	of	look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tell	Wayne	I’m	not	doing	shit	until	we	know	Danny	is	alive.	Wayne	says</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’ll	be	at	the	mineshaft	at	sundown,	says	if	I	don’t	like	it	I	need	to	end	this right	 now.	 I	 don’t	 even	 realize	 he’s	 just	 prying	 my	 mind	 until	 it’s	 too	 late.	 I’m already	picturing	the	path	to	the	cave.	My	hand	grips	the	butt	of	the	shotgun,	but Wayne’s	 not	 going	 to	 let	 me	 hit	 him	 again.	 He	 gave	 me	 one	 and	 that’s	 all	 I’m going	to	get.	He	says	if	I	don’t	fulfill	my	part	of	the	plan,	it’ll	be	the	last	sunset Danny	ever	sees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything’s	too	goddamn	tense.	I	force	a	smile.	“Guess	I’ll	tell	Sharon	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">need	room	for	one	more,”	I	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	the	boy	Momma	raised.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	 pushes	 me	 out	 of	 the	 way,	 peeks	 his	 wild	 eyes	 out	 the	 door.	 The coast	is	clear	so	Wayne	slips	out	and	disappears	back	into	Brightside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stand	there	shaking,	my	hands	going	numb	on	the	Mossberg	12-gauge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	takes	the	gun,	tells	me	I	need	to	calm	down.	I	have	no	idea	why	she’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	 so	 rational,	 but	 I	 figure	 it’s	 all	 for	 Danny.	 Some	 people	 can	 lower	 their pulse	to	save	the	ones	they	love.	My	heart	feels	like	it’s	going	to	rip	at	the	seams. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">So	what	do	we	do	next? </i>	Sara	thinks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing	really,”	I	say,	“I	just	have	to	take	out	that	helicopter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,”	she	says,	“that	all?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">WHEN	I	WAS	THIRTEEN,	Dad	told	me	there	was	no	honor	in	killing	anything</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	a	hundred	yards	away.	If	you	can’t	see	a	man’s	features,	then	he’s	not	a	man at	 all,	 just	 a	 target,	 which	 lessens	 the	 consequences	 of	 taking	 a	 life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consequences	 are	 necessary.	 Without	 them,	 this	 fucked	 up	 existence	 has	 no value	at	all.	That’s	why	he	never	showed	me	how	to	use	a	rifle	or	anything	else</p>
<p class="calibre1">long	 range.	 The	 Mossberg	 12-guage	 could	 shatter	 your	 skull	 across	 a	 football field,	he	said,	but	move	twenty	rows	into	the	stands,	and	you’ll	just	end		up	with a	bruise	or	blind	if	you’re	not	smart	enough	to	blink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad’s	lecture	worked	in	theory,	but	it	didn’t	do	much	to	inspire	confidence</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	my	part	of	the	plan,	the	part	where	I	have	to	take	down	a	fully	armed	chopper hovering	in	the	sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 I	 was	 nine,	 I	 used	 to	 point	 my	 finger	 as	 a	 gun	 and	 take	 out	 the airplanes	 flying	 over	 Columbus.	 I	 didn’t	 realize	 I	 was	 playing	 terrorist,	 never imagined	 one	 day	 that’s	 what	 I’d	 be	 called.	 Thought	 Thieves	 were	 deemed	 the most	 dangerous	 people	 on	 the	 planet	 by	 the	 President,	 the	 government,	 every school	board	across	the	country.	All	because	we	knew	everyone	was	lying. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a>The	 politicians	 weren’t	 a	 surprise,	 but	 the	 pastors	 and	 priests;	 the	 little league	coaches	and	lunch	ladies	threw	everyone	for	a	loop.	It	was	just	easier	to get	rid	of	us,	ship	us	here	to	this	mountain,	than	to	face	the	truth	that	our	society was	 based	 on	 the	 ability	 to	 lie.	 Parents	 tell	 their	 kids	 they’re	 special,	 that	 they love	 them.	 Teachers	 tell	 students	 they	 can	 achieve	 anything.	 Bosses	 want	 their employees	to	know	they’re	valued,	that	they	aren’t	just	a	warm	body	underpaid</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 abused.	 It’s	 how	 everything	 keeps	 moving.	 Without	 the	 lie,	 people	 have	 to fix	shit,	face	conflict,	come	to	terms.	Lying	is	the	buffer	that	keeps	us	all	from ending	up	like	Rachel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thought	 Thieves	 aren’t	 any	 better.	 We	 told	 ourselves	 Brightside	 could	 be worse,	 we	 bought	 into	 the	 bullshit,	 even	 though	 we’d	 been	 ripped	 from	 our homes,	stripped	of	our	jobs	and	families.	We	were	banished	to	this	prison	in	the clouds,	 but	 we	 told	 ourselves	 we’d	 just	 relocated.	 We	 had	 jobs,	 went	 on	 dates, fucked	 coworkers	 and	 the	 last	 person	 left	 at	 the	 bar.	 Lies	 have	 kept	 this	 town intact.	They	give	us	a	reason	to	shower,	brush	our	teeth,	make	our	beds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 none	 of	 it	 was	 real.	 It	 was	 no	 different	 than	 when	 I	 was	 back	 in	 the outside	world.	The	other	salesmen	at	BMW	were	just	like	us.	We	worried	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">paperwork,	what	we	were	going	to	have	for	dinner.	We	wondered	if	we	should</p>
<p class="calibre1">move	 the	 couch	 to	 the	 other	 side	 of	 the	 room.	 Little	 tasks	 and	 stupid	 nonsense kept	our	minds	busy,	but	also	kept	us	from	realizing	all	of	it	was	shit.	Our	lives, jobs,	the	people	we	called	friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve	been	hearing	other	people’s	thoughts	for	as	long	as	I	could	remember, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	no	matter	how	many	times	I	heard	their	lies,	their	excuses,	their	justifications for	 doing	 horrible	 stuff,	 I	 never	 realized	 that	 I	 was	 no	 better.	 Until	 Day	 100. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	when	I	saw	who	I	really	was,	a	coward,	a	fraud,	a	waste	of	potential. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could	have	been	anything,	could	have	used	my	gift	to	get	elected	to	office</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	the	head	of	a	company.	I	could	have	rubbed	elbows	with	the	rich	and	powerful</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 had	 my	 own	 island.	 But	 I	 pissed	 it	 all	 away,	 told	 myself	 I	 was	 better	 than those	 cheats,	 even	 though	 I	 did	 nothing	 but	 swindle.	 I	 stole	 girls’	 hearts,	 told them	 what	 they	 needed	 to	 hear	 to	 get	 them	 in	 bed.	 I	 sold	 luxury	 cars	 to unsuspecting	 souls.	 I	 convinced	 people	 I	 was	 sensitive,	 caring,	 when	 I	 was simply	regurgitating	all	the	things	seeping	out	of	their	heads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	easy	to	keep	secret	because	no	one	was	like	me.	Not	like	Brightside, </p>
<p class="calibre1">where	 secrets	 are	 more	 precious	 than	 life.	 I	 still	 can’t	 believe	 I’ve	 lasted	 a hundred	days.	I	guess	I’m	lucky	Wayne	escaped	and	Sharon	accelerated	the	plan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	week	and	I’d	be	locked	away	in	the	Cabin	or	in	a	cage	with	the	orange</p>
<p class="calibre1">jumpsuits.	 I’ve	 been	 cracking,	 letting	 too	 many	 people	 in.	 Now	 Danny’s	 with Wayne	 and	 Sara’s	 involved.	 Then	 there’s	 Rachel,	 poor	 faceless	 Rachel,	 shoved in	my	closet,	her	version	of	a	suicide	note	still	stained	on	the	ceiling,	the	floors. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>Sara’s	in	the	bathroom,	so	I	decide	to	take	the	opportunity	to	say	goodbye.	I open	 the	 closet	 and	 crouch	 down	 next	 to	 Rachel.	 I	 tell	 her	 I’m	 sorry	 again, imagine	she	forgives	me.	I	tell	her	there’s	a	good	chance	when	this	is	over	I’ll	be joining	her.	I	wonder	if	they’ll	put	us	side	by	side	in	the	cemetery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	the	rumors	are	true,	we	might	all	end	up	there	soon.	Wendell	and	Carlos; </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal	 and	 Phuc.	 Every	 Brightsider	 buried	 to	 keep	 the	 world	 safe.	 I	 honestly don’t	know	how	they	ever	thought	this	could	last.	Selling	timeshares	and	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">crap	over	the	phone	was	never	going	to	keep	this	place	going.	Just	another	lie	we told	ourselves	to	keep	one	foot	moving	in	front	of	the	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 just	 keep	 thinking	 about	 Wendell	 and	 all	 the	 people	 we’re	 going	 to abandon,	 the	 ones	 too	 risky	 for	 Sharon’s	 club.	 If	 I	 succeed	 and	 take	 out	 the helicopter,	 there’s	 going	 to	 be	 panic	 and	 chaos,	 bullets	 ripping	 through	 bodies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Boots	won’t	know	who’s	with	Sharon	and	who	just	happened	to	be	taking	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">walk.	 It’s	 all	 a	 part	 of	 Sharon’s	 plan.	 The	 distraction,	 the	 confusion,	 the	 melee that	follows.	It’s	going	to	buy	us	time,	keep	the	Boots	one	step	behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Collateral	damage	is	just	another	detail	in	this	fucked	up	scheme. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	comes	out	of	the	bathroom	and	says	she	wants	to	know	how	I’m	going</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 pull	 this	 off.	 There’s	 no	 point	 in	 lying.	 I	 haven’t	 a	 fucking	 clue.	 Sharon	 had suggestions,	 like	 climbing	 a	 tree	 or	 throwing	 rocks	 to	 get	 the	 pilot’s	 attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	brilliant	leader	is	an	idiot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	asks	how	close	I	have	to	be.	I	tell	her	under	fifty	yards,	but	probably</p>
<p class="calibre1">under	twenty	to	be	safe.	It’s	been	over	ten	years	since	I’ve	fired	this	shotgun,	and I	know	I’m	going	to	be	shaking	and	scared	out	of	my	mind.	I’ve	only	hit	a	few</p>
<p class="calibre1">birds,	but	that	was	because	of	the	buckshot	spray.	It	only	took	one	tiny	pellet	to take	out	a	quail.	The	helicopter’s	going	to	take	a	hell	of	a	lot	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	says	she	wants	to	come	with	me,	but	she’s	only	being	polite.	She	also</p>
<p class="calibre1">needs	to	stay	hidden.	The	Boots	are	busy	looking	for	Wayne,	but	if	they	find	her they	won’t	hesitate	to	take	her	in.	I	tell	her	she	needs	to	stay	here	until	it’s	time to	make	a	run	for	the	cave.	Sara	refuses,	says	there’s	no	way	she’s	going	to	just sit	here	while	I’m	out	there	risking	my	life.	Plus,	she	wants	to	find	Danny.	She says	she	saw	a	flicker	in	Wayne’s	thoughts.	It	was	just	a	blip,	but	she	saw	Danny near	 a	 tree.	 I	 tell	 her	 Wayne	 isn’t	 dumb	 enough	 to	 slip	 up	 like	 that.	 In	 all likelihood	 he’s	 trying	 to	 get	 her	 caught,	 giving	 the	 plan	 another	 distraction	 to keep	the	Boots	off	our	ass.	Still,	she’s	definitely	not	staying	here,	she	says,	so	we make	a	compromise.	I	tell	her	she	needs	to	make	sure	no	one	sees	me	go	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">office.	She	can	help	me	get	in	so	I	can	get	to	the	roof. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	SEVENTEEN</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	PROMISED	WAYNE	I’D	talk	to	Sharon,	but	there’s	no	point	telling	her	shit.	If</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	do	and	she	agrees,	there	isn’t	a	damn	difference,	but	if	she	freaks,	like	I	know she	will,	then	I’m	only	putting	Danny	in	more	danger.	Wayne’s	going	to	be	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether	I	talk	to	Sharon	or	not,	and	his	big	ass	isn’t	going	to	climb	down	a	rope by	 himself.	 And	 he’s	 going	 to	 want	 in	 on	 the	 getaway	 vehicle,	 whatever	 that might	 be.	 I’m	 such	 an	 idiot	 for	 not	 asking	 Sharon	 for	 more	 details.	 I	 was	 too caught	 up	 in	 arguing	 about	 Sara	 and	 Danny	 being	 sent	 to	 the	 Cabin	 and	 my father	turning	me	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still,	I	have	to	call	her.	Sara	and	Danny	have	to	be	included	in	the	getaway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	take	out	the	cell	phone,	the	one	Sharon	said	couldn’t	be	traced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	a	problem?”	Those	are	the	first	words	out	of	Sharon’s	mouth	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost	tell	her	there	are	more	problems	than	she	can	handle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	one,”	I	say.	“Sara	and	Danny	are	both	coming.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Absolutely	not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	I’m	not	firing	a	fucking	shot	and	that	helicopter	will	be	sitting	right</p>
<p class="calibre1">outside	the	mineshaft.	You	can	kiss	your	little	plan	goodbye.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon’s	breathing,	and	while	I	can’t	hear	her	thoughts,	I	know	that	damn</p>
<p class="calibre1">mantra	is	on	full	blast	in	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	your	call,”	I	say.		“But	I’m	not	doing	shit	until	I	know	they’re	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon’s	teeth	click	a	few	times.	She	says,	“Fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah?	I	have	your	word?”	As	if	her	word	means	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	but	if	they	get	caught	on	the	way	to	the	cave	or	if	they’re	one	second</p>
<p class="calibre1">late,	we’re	not	waiting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	Joe?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	fail,	the	deal’s	off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah...”	 I	 start	 to	 ask	 how	 we’re	 getting	 off	 this	 mountain	 if	 we	 actually pull	this	off,	but	Sharon’s	already	hung	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	know	Sharon	has	something	waiting	for	us	when	we	get	out,	a	bus	or	car</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	even	a	plane.	She	told	me	there	were	others	in	the	real	world,	ones	yet	to	be discovered,	willing	to	help	us.	Unlike	Danny,	Sara,	and	me,	there	were	a	lot	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thought	 Thieves	 rolling	 in	 cash.	 They	 broke	 into	 banks	 already	 knowing	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>security	 codes.	 They	 bought	 stocks	 on	 silent	 information.	 They	 took	 down casinos	 one	 table	 at	 a	 time,	 knowing	 exactly	 what	 the	 dealer	 or	 other	 players were	 holding.	 Unless	 they	 were	 stupid	 or	 too	 goddamn	 greedy,	 there	 are probably	hundreds,	even	thousands,	still	on	the	outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	makes	me	wonder	how	many	Thought	Thieves	are	still	sitting	in	power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 President	 himself	 only	 signed	 the	 law	 after	 the	 panic	 had	 gotten	 out	 of control.	 I	 like	 the	 idea	 of	 the	 Commander	 in	 Chief	 being	 one	 of	 us.	 It	 would explain	 his	 second	 term,	 how	 frequently	 he	 fires	 top	 officials.	 I	 imagine	 the White	 House	 is	 filled	 with	 people	 looking	 to	 take	 him	 down,	 but	 he’d	 know every	move	before	they	could	make	a	grab	at	his	job. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	Carl	Pepper,	the	man	who	supposedly	saved	the	President’s	life,	never</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	to	be	fully	responsible	for	stopping	the	assassination.	When	they	played</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	scene	on	the	news,	the	President	definitely	ducked	before	Carl	clobbered	the gunman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carl	 was	 one	 of	 the	 first	 sent	 to	 Brightside,	 but	 no	 one	 has	 seen	 or	 heard from	 him	 since.	 He’s	 either	 dead	 or	 locked	 up	 so	 tight	 he’s	 wishing	 he	 were.	 I can’t	imagine	what	Carl	must	be	going	through.	He	was	a	hero	for	a	week,	then	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">villain	 for	 life.	 I’m	 sure	 there’s	 not	 a	 second	 of	 the	 day	 he	 doesn’t	 wish	 he would’ve	let	the	gunman	fire	the	shot.	The	President	he	saved	banished	him	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	 a	 traitor	 and	 I	 can’t	 fathom	 how	 that	 must	 feel.	 Even	 though	 my	 own father	turned	me	in,	at	least	he	tried	to	offer	me	a	way	out.	Carl	is	just	fucked, same	as	all	the	other	Brightsiders	we’ll	leave	behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 need	 to	 stop	 thinking	 about	 pointless	 crap.	 Who	 cares	 what	 Carl	 is thinking	or	if	the	President	is	a	Thought	Thief?	Neither	is	going	to	help	me	one bit.	 I	 have	 a	 job	 to	 do,	 and	 I	 need	 to	 shut	 off	 my	 head.	 I	 know	 I’m	 doing	 it	 to distract	 myself,	 to	 keep	 from	 thinking	 about	 the	 chopper’s	 gun	 spinning	 and firing	fifty	rounds	into	my	chest	before	I	even	take	aim,	but	if	I	can’t	control	my thoughts,	I’ll	for	sure	end	up	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara’s	wearing	a	stocking	cap,	parka,	and	these	huge	sunglasses	Rachel	left</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	my	place	on	Day	39.	I’m	wearing	my	puffy	jacket	wishing	I	had	a	trench	coat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	shotgun	is	practically	sticking	out	the	bottom	of	my	pants,	and	it’s	making</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	walk	like	someone	who’s	trying	to	hide	a	gun.	There’s	an	elastic	drawstring</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	the	bottom	of	the	jacket,	and	I	pull	it	tight	to	keep	the	Mossberg	in	place.	But	I just	keep	picturing	it	sliding	down	and	blowing	off	my	leg.	Sara	asks	if	I	have	a duffle	bag	or	something,	says	this	just	looks	stupid.	I	run	to	the	closet	and	have to	pull	Rachel	forward	to	slide	out	the	bag.	It’s	covered	in	blood,	which	is	only going	to	draw	more	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 rummage	 through	 the	 closet,	 through	 all	 of	 Dad’s	 boxes,	 when	 I	 find	 a backpack.	 It’s	 too	 small	 to	 hide	 the	 Mossberg,	 but	 it’s	 better	 than	 keeping	 it	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a><img src="index-159_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 pants,	 so	 I	 fieldstrip	 the	 gun.	 Not	 all	 of	 it,	 just	 break	 it	 down	 so	 it’ll	 fit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Assembling	it	is	going	to	take	more	time,	time	I	don’t	know	if	I’ll	have,	but	it’s the	best	option	I’ve	got. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	WALK	TO	THE	OFFICE	is	freezing	because	the	sun	is	about	to	set.	I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">wearing	headphones,	but	my	iPod	is	turned	off.	I’m	just	silently	talking	to	Sara as	 we	 move	 down	 the	 street.	 Most	 people	 are	 at	 work	 or	 locked	 away	 in	 their apartments.	Wayne	has	set	everyone	on	edge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	building	where	I	work	has	a	small	crowd	out	front,	but	I	don’t	see	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">Boots.	Neither	Sara	nor	I	know	how	many	people	heard	she’s	being	sent	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cabin,	 but	 we	 can’t	 take	 any	 chances.	 I	 have	 to	 go	 in	 alone.	 We	 keep	 our distance	and	switch	up	the	plan.	It’s	better	this	way,	because	Sara	needs	to	draw the	helicopter	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	slips	off	through	the	Square.	I	watch	her	and	have	the	fear	this	might	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	last	time	I	ever	see	her.	I	want	to	chase	her	down,	tell	her	how	sorry	I	am	she got	pulled	into	this,	but	again,	it’s	not	going	to	help	me	do	what	I	have	to	do.	I flick	on	my	iPod,	crank	it	as	loud	as	it	can	go	before	entering	the	building.	There are	 a	 few	 people	 getting	 into	 the	 elevator	 so	 I	 take	 the	 east	 stairs.	 The	 shotgun pieces	 clang	 around	 in	 my	 backpack	 as	 I	 climb.	 Luckily,	 no	 one	 is	 in	 the stairwell,	though,	I	sort	of	wish	there	were.	I	want	someone	to	catch	me,	to	make me	 go	 back	 to	 my	 apartment.	 The	 Cabin	 doesn’t	 seem	 like	 such	 an	 awful outcome	right	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 hand	 goes	 to	 the	 door	 handle,	 but	 I	 can’t	 open	 it.	 It’s	 not	 locked,	 I’m just	 freaking	 out.	 I	 keep	 thinking	 about	 how	 I	 almost	 plummeted	 off	 the	 side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	had	to	pull	me	up	to	save	my	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	 leaning	 against	 the	 wall	 and	 I	 can	 feel	 the	 sweat	 soaking	 through	 my clothes,	 which	 doesn’t	 feel	 all	 that	 bad	 because	 it’s	 so	 fucking	 hot	 here	 in	 the stairwell.	I	decide	to	put	the	shotgun	together.	If	the	helicopter	flies	over	while I’m	assembling	it,	they’ll	kill	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	also	needs	time	to	get	to	the	Boots.	She’s	supposed	to	say	Wayne	is	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	building.	I	told	her	to	keep	her	distance	to	let	others	spread	the	word,	but	I know	 she’s	 not	 going	 to	 risk	 Danny	 to	 save	 herself.	 I	 just	 hope	 they	 don’t recognize	her	before	they	head	this	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 barrel	 clicks,	 and	 I	 pull	 out	 the	 shells.	 Slide	 two	 in.	 I	 have	 another dozen	in	the	backpack,	but	I’ll	never	get	the	chance	to	reload.	It’s	one	shot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Mossberg	is	in	my	hands,	and	I	keep	thinking	about	Rachel.	If	someone</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	to	see	me,	I	don’t	know	what	I’d	do.	I	guess	I’d	have	to	shoot,	but	that’s</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>only	going	to	alert	the	Boots,	the	helicopter,	and	the	gunner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 suddenly	 realize	 this	 plan’s	 already	 fucked.	 Sara’s	 going	 to	 tell	 them Wayne’s	here,	meaning	they’ll	already	be	looking	to	kill	him,	meaning	as	soon</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	they	see	I’m	armed,	I’m	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	starting	to	think	this	really	is	all	a	setup.	Melvin	could	get	a	hell	of	a	lot closer	to	the	helicopter	than	me.	But	Sharon	said	I	was	the	only	one	for	the	job. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’re	 probably	 already	 at	 the	 cave	 escaping,	 while	 I’m	 up	 here	 like	 an idiot	holding	a	shotgun	that	will	draw	all	the	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	hating	my	father	right	now	for	trusting	that	lying	bitch,	for	giving	me	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">shotgun	instead	of	a	rifle,	which	I	could	fire	from	cover,	instead	of	standing	right out	in	the	open,	making	it	so	easy	to	take	me	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Plus,	 I	 don’t	 even	 have	 an	 escape	 plan.	 The	 helicopter	 will	 definitely	 beat the	Boots	here,	but	it	won’t	be	long	before	they	secure	the	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	least	Sara’s	not	with	me.	Danny	either.	They	might	still	have	a	chance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 is	 what	 I’m	 telling	 myself	 as	 I	 hear	 the	 distant	  <i class="calibre4">thwump</i>	 of	 the	 chopper getting	louder	and	louder.	I	don’t	even	have	to	put	my	ear	to	the	door	to	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s	almost	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara’s	 supposed	 to	 meet	 me	 at	 the	 pond.	 I	 know	 she	 won’t	 wait	 forever.	 I told	her	she	can’t	be	late	to	the	cave.	It’s	Danny	who’s	important.	I	just	hope	she doesn’t	hold	out	too	long.	Sharon	won’t	hesitate	to	leave	her	and	Danny	behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wonder	what’s	going	to	happen	with	Wayne.	When	Sharon	sees	him,	she’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	to	shit	herself.	I	wish	I	could	be	there	to	see	her	face.	I	just	hope	Wayne doesn’t	get	Danny	killed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 hand	 is	 on	 the	 door	 handle	 and	 my	 heart	 feels	 like	 it’s	 the	 size	 of	 my head.	The	Mossberg’s	at	my	side,	my	finger	just	above	the	trigger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything’s	tunneling.	I	can’t	breathe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	sounds	like	the	helicopter	is	circling.	I	need	to	time	this	right,	wait	until it’s	on	the	other	side	of	the	building	before	coming	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voices	 fill	 the	 stairwell,	 but	 they’re	 not	 coming	 up.	 Everyone’s	 fleeing, meaning	the	Boots	are	probably	already	here.	They’ll	sweep	every	floor.	I’ve	run out	of	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 chopper	 is	 as	 loud	 as	 ever.	 I	 wait	 for	 a	 couple	 of	 seconds	 until	 it’s	 a little	quieter,	hoping	I	can	make	it	to	the	wall	next	to	the	air	conditioners	before the	gunner	sees	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	hand	presses	down.	The	click	of	the	door.	At	least	this	will	be	quick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	throw	open	the	door	and	I’m	practically	blind	from	the	sun.	I	stayed	too</p>
<p class="calibre1">long	in	the	stairwell	and	my	eyes	can’t	adjust.	The	chopper’s	coming	around	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	finger	goes	to	the	trigger.	It’s	so	loud	and	bright.	I	press	my	back	against	the wall,	 hold	 the	 shotgun	 to	 my	 chest.	 I’m	 closing	 my	 eyes	 picturing	 Lily	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>Rachel	and	my	parents.	Dad’s	telling	me	I	can’t	be	afraid	to	pull	the	trigger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 I	 suddenly	 realize	 that	 fear	 might	 be	 the	 only	 way	 out	 of	 this.	 The chopper	is	less	than	two	seconds	from	seeing	me	with	this	shotgun.	There’s	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	I	can	pull	this	off,	not	like	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 I	 drop	 the	 gun,	 kick	 it	 so	 it’s	 under	 the	 metal	 folding	 chair.	 The	 one	 I used	to	salute	the	flag	and	sing	like	a	goddamn	lunatic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	exactly	what	I	have	to	look	like.	A	man	who	has	lost	his	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 take	 off	 running,	 waving	 my	 arms,	 screaming	 at	 the	 top	 of	 my	 lungs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“HE’S	 IN	 THE	 STAIRWELL!	 WAYNE	 KING	 IS	 COMING	 DOWN!”	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">gunner’s	hands	are	wrapped	around	steel,	ready	to	open	fire,	and	I	have	no	idea</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	he	can	understand	a	word	I’m	saying.	But	I	just	keep	screaming	that	Wayne’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">heading	down	the	stairs	and	start	pointing	over	the	edge.	I’m	right	up	against	it, looking	 over,	 seeing	 the	 ground,	 but	 somehow	 with	 all	 the	 adrenaline,	 I’m	 not afraid.	I’m	just	screaming,	“DOWN!	DOWN!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	gunner	must	understand	enough,	because	he’s	saying	something	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pilot,	 who	 starts	 to	 circle	 around	 to	 the	 front	 of	 the	 building.	 He’s	 descending, the	rotor	now	even	with	the	ledge.	They’re	looking	in	the	windows,	looking	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turn	back	to	the	wall,	where	the	shotgun	is	and	take	off	running.	I	try	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">pick	 it	 up,	 but	 my	 hand	 smacks	 against	 the	 folding	 chair.	 The	 chopper	 sounds like	it’s	starting	to	pull	away	to	get	a	better	view.	I	flip	over	the	chair,	grab	the gun,	 and	 run	 back	 to	 the	 ledge.	 The	 crowd	 down	 below	 is	 staring	 up	 at	 the chopper.	 I	 see	 them	 through	 the	 spinning	 blades,	 moving	 so	 fast	 it’s	 just	 this translucent	swirl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 tell	 them	 to	 fucking	 move	 even	 though	 they	 can’t	 hear	 me.	 I	 raise	 the barrel	and	aim	it	right	at	the	center	of	the	blades.	One	shot.	That’s	all	I	get. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 hold	 my	 breath,	 just	 like	 Dad	 taught	 me.	 One	 eye	 closed.	 Shoulder’s relaxed.	Arm	steady. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	 down	 below	 sees	 what	 I’m	 about	 to	 do	 and	 screams	 something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	crowd	looks	up	and	I’m	waving	my	hand	to	tell	them	to	get	the	fuck	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	pilot	must	see	them,	because	the	chopper	begins	to	rise.	I	don’t	have	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">choice.	The	gunner	is	going	to	have	me	in	his	sights	any	second. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	finger	curls	around	the	trigger,	just	like	Rachel’s	and	Grandpa’s	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything	went	dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	blast	is	louder	than	the	rotor	and	the	kickback	practically	separates	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulder,	searing	pain	shooting	down	my	arm.	But	I	don’t	move.	Just	watch	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">buckshot	spark	off	the	blades,	which	slow	down	to	the	point	I	can	see	all	four. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 the	 chopper	 begins	 to	 tilt.	 The	 pilot’s	 trying	 to	 pull	 up	 or	 set	 it	 down.	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>can’t	tell.	I	just	see	the	crowd	running	and	the	blades	grinding	and	carving	into the	 street.	 Sparks	 and	 metal	 spray	 into	 the	 air	 and	 sidewalk.	 The	 fire	 isn’t instantaneous,	but	it	doesn’t	take	long	before	the	entire	helicopter	explodes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	women	are	thrown	back.	A	guy	is	holding	his	face,	obviously	burned</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	ripped	up	by	the	shards	of	metal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	gun	is	still	in	my	hands	as	I	back	up,	nearly	trip.	I	stare	into	the	sun	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	crackling	sounds	mingle	with	screams. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	the	hell	have	I	done? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	closes	behind	me	as	I	enter	the	stairwell.	I’m	against	the	wall	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">shaking.	 The	 backpack	 is	 on	 the	 floor	 and	 I	 just	 stare	 at	 it,	 knowing	 I	 need	 to break	down	the	shotgun,	but	I	hear	voices	coming	up	from	the	first	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Boots	are	here,	and	I	have	nowhere	to	run.	They’re	going	to	open	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	fingers	fumble	for	the	shells,	but	I	can’t	keep	a	grip.	It’s	like	they’re	covered in	 oil.	 I	 look	 over	 the	 side.	 Someone	 is	 definitely	 coming.	 A	 seven-floor	 climb and	it’s	all	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	see	the	next	level	down,	the	door	that	leads	to	my	office.	I	grab	the	pack</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 race	 down	 the	 stairs.	 The	 voices	 are	 getting	 closer.	 I	 stay	 against	 the	 wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 foot	 misses	 a	 step	 and	 I	 nearly	 fall,	 my	 ass	 almost	 hitting	 the	 stairs,	 but	 I keep	moving,	flinging	myself	towards	the	door.	My	hand	finds	the	handle	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">quickly	slip	in,	expecting	to	see	Carlos	and	Alex	and	all	my	coworkers	ready	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">tackle	me,	but	the	floor’s	empty,	everyone	evacuated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	office	is	right	there	and	I	think	about	hiding,	crawling	under	my	desk, </p>
<p class="calibre1">curling	 into	 a	 ball,	 curling	 so	 tight	 that	 I	 wake	 up	 and	 find	 myself	 back	 on	 the couch	with	Michelle	and	Lily.	The	TV	still	on	 <i class="calibre4">Letterman</i>	and	my	ears	fine.	No flashbang.	No	gunshots	into	Lily’s	ribs.	All	of	it	just	a	terrible	dream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 hiding	 in	 my	 office	 isn’t	 going	 to	 keep	 me	 alive.	 I	 need	 to	 get	 to	 the cave,	find	Danny	and	Sara.	If	Wayne’s	holding	Danny	and	Sharon	refuses	to	let</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	 join	 her,	 Sharon	 won’t	 hesitate.	 She’ll	 tell	 Melvin	 to	 take	 them	 both	 out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	sure	by	now	they	have	guns.	I	have	to	keep	moving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	get	to	the	elevators	I	see	the	red	numbers	rising.	If	the	doors	open,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">might	get	off	a	shot,	but	it	stops	one	floor	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 lungs	 start	 working	 again.	 I	 lean	 against	 the	 wall,	 trying	 to	 figure	 out how	the	hell	I’m	going	to	get	out	of	here.	I	can	see	Carlos’s	office,	think	about just	 climbing	 out	 the	 window.	 It’s	 one	 less	 floor	 than	 Paul	 fell.	 Maybe	 I’d	 just break	an	ankle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 I	 hear	 the	 stairwell	 door	 open.	 Whispers.	 They’re	 checking	 offices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking	for	Wayne,	for	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	finger	goes	to	the	trigger,	but	I	remember	I	didn’t	load	it.	I’m	digging</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	in	the	backpack.	An	office	door	opens.	A	voice	says,	“Clear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a>I’m	 picturing	 the	 floor	 plan.	 There	 are	 only	 three	 offices	 between	 the stairwell	and	the	elevators. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	different	voice,	another,	“Clear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	finally	get	a	shell	in	my	hand.	I’m	sliding	it	in.	Trying	to	click	the	barrel</p>
<p class="calibre1">closed	as	quietly	as	possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	a	voice	whispers,	“Joe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 turn,	 ready	 to	 fire,	 when	 I	 see	 Wendell	 peering	 out	 from	 the	 bathroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s	 waving	 me	 in	 with	 that	 big,	 meaty	 paw.	 He	 seems	 friendly,	 more	 friendly than	whoever	is	searching	our	offices,	so	I	step	towards	him.	I’m	ten	feet	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 bathroom.	 I	 hear	 bootsteps.	 I	 turn	 around	 and	 back	 in	 to	 the	 bathroom	 so	 I can	still	take	a	shot	if	they	come	around	the	corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendell	shuts	the	door	without	making	a	sound,	holding	the	handle	so	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">isn’t	a	click.	Then	his	fat	finger	presses	to	his	lips	as	if	I	need	to	be	reminded	to stay	quiet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	whispers	are	at	the	elevator.	I	can	hear	them	through	the	door.	I	push</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendell	back	and	put	my	ear	against	the	wood	and	listen.	They	must	be	giving</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand	signals.	It’s	quiet,	but	I	know	they’re	coming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	look	around	the	bathroom.	The	stalls	aren’t	going	to	keep	me	hidden	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	than	a	few	seconds.	They’ll	just	kick	in	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	walkie-talkie	goes	off.	A	voice	tells	them	someone	is	on	the	roof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bootsteps	running,	fading	until	I	hear	the	faint	sound	of	the	stairwell	door</p>
<p class="calibre1">slamming	shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendell	exhales,	thinks	we’re	safe,	but	I	know	we’re	not.	I	only	heard	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">set	of	boots	running.	There	were	definitely	two	whispers.	I	silently	tell	Wendell to	get	back	against	the	wall.	I	press	myself	against	the	sink,	the	small	puddle	of water	on	the	counter	seeps	into	my	pants.	The	gun’s	aimed	at	the	door.	I	see	the handle	 slowly	 turn.	 Sweat	 drips	 into	 my	 eyes,	 but	 I’m	 trying	 not	 to	 blink.	 The door	begins	to	open.	I	see	the	barrel	of	the	revolver,	the	eyes	of	the	newbie,	the Boot	 that	 was	 guarding	 Robert’s	 door	 so	 no	 one	 would	 see	 him	 swinging	 from the	ceiling,	his	dick	still	hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 newbie	 enters.	 He’s	 shaking,	 staring	 down	 the	 Mossberg.	 He’s	 telling me	 to	 drop	 it,	 but	 I’m	 not	 moving.	 Wendell’s	 against	 the	 wall.	 The	 newbie doesn’t	see	him.	He	just	keeps	telling	me	to	put	it	down.	His	voice	trembles.	His finger	tight	against	the	trigger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 know	 he’s	 going	 to	 fire,	 whether	 he	 wants	 to	 or	 not.	 I	 stay	 real	 still, knowing	even	a	twitch	will	get	him	to	take	the	shot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,”	I	tell	him.	“I’m	putting	down	the	gun.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	yeah,	that’s	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	bend	forward,	gently	placing	the	shotgun	on	the	wet	floor.	He	tells	me	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a>kick	it	towards	him.	I	do	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	just	want	to	get	out	of	here,”	I	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 looks	 confused,	 as	 if	 I’m	 telling	 him	 I’m	 from	 another	 planet.	 He stretches	 out	 his	 leg	 and	 puts	 his	 foot	 on	 the	 Mossberg,	 slides	 it	 back.	 The revolver	still	aimed	at	my	chest.	He	takes	one	hand	off	the	gun	and	goes	for	the walkie-talkie,	his	eyes	never	leaving	mine.	He	fumbles	the	walkie,	nearly	drops</p>
<p class="calibre1">it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendell’s	inching	forward,	and	I	can	hear	his	fucking	breath	from	here.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">newbie	starts	to	turn,	but	Wendell	drives	his	shoulder	into	his	stomach	and	plows him	 into	 the	 paper	 towel	 dispenser.	 I	 grab	 the	 newbie’s	 arm,	 pry	 the	 revolver from	his	hand.	Wendell’s	got	him	against	the	sink	now,	and	the	newbie’s	flailing, his	hand	finding	Wendell’s	face,	trying	to	force	the	big	fellow	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendell	lifts	and	the	newbie	is	off	the	ground	for	a	second	before	Wendell</p>
<p class="calibre1">slams	him	down.	The	newbie’s	head	cracks	against	the	sink.	His	body	slumps	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	wet	floor.	I	can’t	tell	if	he’s	dead	or	just	knocked	out.	Wendell’s	breathing	in clumps,	like	he’s	about	to	have	a	heart	attack.	He	drags	his	sleeve	across	his	lips, just	stares	at	the	newbie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 want	 to	 tell	 him	 thanks,	 but	 the	 whole	 thing	 is	 just	 too	 crazy.	 I	 keep	 my eyes	on	Wendell	until	he	finally	turns.	He’s	more	shocked	than	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	okay?”	I	ask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendell	nods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	okay,”	I	repeat,	trying	to	think.	The	newbie’s	body	is	still	splayed	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	floor	and	there’s	no	way	we’ll	be	able	to	explain	it	to	the	Boots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You,	 uh...”	 Wendell	 takes	 a	 second	 to	 catch	 his	 breath.	 “You	 have	 to	 get my	sister.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	to	help	her	escape.	She’s	working	in	the	deli.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	even	know	Wendell	had	family	here.	For	a	second,	I	think	Wendell</p>
<p class="calibre1">might	 be	 a	 part	 of	 Sharon’s	 club,	 but	 he	 tells	 me	 he	 just	 learned	 about	 it, overheard	someone’s	thoughts.	He	says	Sharon	would	never	let	him	in.	He	says, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	too	fat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 voice	 comes	 through	 newbie’s	 walkie-talkie.	 The	 voice	 says	 there’s	 no one	on	the	roof,	says	he’s	coming	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Her	name’s	Becky,”	Wendell	says.	“She’s	at	the	deli.	You	have	to	get	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	have	to.”	Wendell’s	eyes	are	as	wide	and	pleading	as	I’ve	ever	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,”	I	tell	him.	“We’ll	go	get	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	he	says,	“just	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ding	of	the	elevator. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	set	of	boots. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a>I	grab	the	shotgun.	Wendell	picks	up	the	revolver. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">You	know	how	to	use	that? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendell	shakes	his	head	no. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Just	squeeze	and	don’t	close	your	eyes. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendell	 nods,	 but	 he’s	 so	 out	 of	 breath	 he	 can’t	 hold	 the	 gun	 still.	 If someone	walks	in,	I’m	going	to	get	shot	from	both	directions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	stairwell	door	opens	and	shuts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 bootsteps	 are	 moving,	 but	 not	 towards	 us.	 There’s	 a	 muffled</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 decide	 to	 peek	 out,	 figuring	 they’re	 going	 to	 come	 here	 eventually.	 The elevator	doors	are	still	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Follow	me. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">No. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Goddamnit,	just	do	it. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I’m	staying, </i>	Wendell	thinks.  <i class="calibre4">Just	go. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	no	time	to	argue.	I	take	off,	angle	my	body	to	slip	in	just	before	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">doors	 close.	 My	 fingers	 mash	 the	 button.	 I	 hear	 the	 Boots,	 the	 bathroom	 door click	shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	in	there!”	one	of	them	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	 yelling	 is	 muffled.	 I	 can’t	 tell	 if	 one	 of	 the	 voices	 is	 Wendell.	 The lower	the	elevator	goes,	the	harder	it	is	to	hear.	But	the	next	six	quick	sounds	are unmistakable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 elevator	 slows,	 it’s	 about	 to	 hit	 the	 first	 floor.	 I	 shove	 the	 shotgun	 up under	my	jacket,	angle	it	so	it’s	not	poking	me	in	the	chin.	Then	the	doors	start to	open	and	I	immediately	regret	it.	I	should’ve	kept	it	out.	Who	knows	what’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">waiting?	 Luckily,	 there	 are	 people	 everywhere,	 everyone	 jostling	 towards	 the front	doors.	I	keep	my	head	down	and	sink	into	the	crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	 of	 the	 Boots	 are	 on	 walkie-talkies.	 I	 stay	 hidden	 behind	 a	 few</p>
<p class="calibre1">Brightsiders.	 We’re	 almost	 out	 the	 door	 when	 the	 voice	 over	 the	 walkie-talkie says	they	got	the	guy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendell’s	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a><img src="index-166_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">CHAPTER	EIGHTEEN</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	 SMELL	 OF	 BURNING	 metal,	 leather,	 and	 flesh.	 Everyone	 is	 circled</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	 the	 wreckage	 so	 I	 can’t	 see	 the	 pilot	 or	 the	 gunner,	 just	 the	 one	 single blade	 rising	 towards	 the	 purpling	 sky.	 The	 sun	 is	 starting	 to	 creep	 under	 the horizon.	 I	 move	 through	 the	 crowd.	 Some	 people	 weep;	 others	 just	 stare	 in shock.	 Harry,	 my	 hermit	 neighbor	 with	 his	 little	 toupee,	 is	 barking	 out instructions	in	his	thick	Boston	accent,	telling	Brightsiders	to	take	off	their	coats and	 carry	 them	 across	 the	 street.	 They	 lay	 them	 flat	 on	 the	 ground	 and	 start scooping	handfuls	of	snow,	piling	it	right	on	the	coats.	Two	people,	one	on	each end,	 lift	 each	 coat	 like	 a	 hammock	 and	 shuffle	 back,	 flinging	 the	 mounds	 of snow	onto	the	flames. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	don’t	know	what	I	expected,	but	definitely	not	this.	They’re	trying	to	put</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	the	fire	because	of	the	pilot,	who’s	still	moving.	His	charred,	blistered	hand reaching	out	through	the	broken	glass	and	twisted	metal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	prisoners	desperately	trying	to	save	their	captor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stockholm	 Syndrome	 is	 the	 first	 thought	 in	 my	 head.	 But	 these	 people</p>
<p class="calibre1">genuinely	want	to	help.	They’re	praying	they’ll	get	him	out	before	it’s	too	late. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’re	good	and	decent.	They	don’t	want	the	man	to	die.	They	just	see	a	crisis</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 want	 to	 do	 what’s	 right.	 The	 government	 calls	 them	 Thought	 Thieves,	 but these	people	are	definitely	not	terrorists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 stomach’s	 climbing	 up	 my	 throat	 and	 I	 try	 to	 escape	 the	 smoke,	 but can’t.	The	wind	swirls	it,	covering	me	no	matter	which	way	I	move.	I	bump	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	woman	and	feel	the	shotgun	almost	slip	out	of	my	jacket.	I	tell	her	I’m	sorry</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	keep	my	hand	on	the	butt	of	the	gun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More	Boots	are	arriving,	but	no	one	notices	me.	The	pilot	is	all	that	matters, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	pilot	I	shot	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	is	telling	me	to	run,	but	I	keep	it	slow	and	steady.	I	can’t	draw</p>
<p class="calibre1">attention,	that	I	know.	I’m	not	even	watching	where	I’m	going.	I’m	just	moving</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	the	street	and	I	can’t	stop	picturing	the	pilot’s	hand,	the	desperate,	pathetic reach,	each	black	finger	pleading	for	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve	never	actively	taken	a	life.	Rachel	died	because	of	what	I	couldn’t	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily,	 because	 I	 stayed	 in	 one	 place	 too	 long,	 let	 the	 Boots	 close	 in.	 I	 stopped being	 Steven’s	 friend,	 but	 I	 didn’t	 give	 him	 cancer.	 And	 Robert	 just	 heard	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a>thoughts,	but	Wayne	was	the	man	who	strung	him	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 gunner,	 the	 pilot...this	 is	 completely	 on	 me.	 I	 aimed	 the	 gun.	 I	 pulled the	trigger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon’s	voice	is	echoing	my	father’s.  <i class="calibre4">You’re	going	to	do	great	things,	Joe. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">So	fucking	great.	I	actually	thought	I	was	doing	the	right	thing.	The	Boots</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	evil;	they	needed	to	be	put	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	if	that’s	the	case,	then	why	do	I	feel	like	shit? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 don’t	 even	 realize	 I’m	 near	 the	 pond,	 but	 Sara’s	 calling	 my	 name.	 She comes	running	out	from	behind	some	trees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 thank	 God.	 I	 didn’t	 think	 you	 were	 going	 to	 show.	 I	 didn’t	 know	 if something...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	alright?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Holy	shit,	I	can’t	believe	you	did	it.”	Sara	keeps	looking	past	me,	staring	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	in	the	distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	can’t	look	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	smiles.	“Well,	we	both	made	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’d	you	get	away	from	the	Boots?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	 were	 searching	 a	 building	 near	 the	 Square.	 Questioning	 people, </p>
<p class="calibre1">seeing	 if	 anyone	 knew	 anything.	 I	 just	 ran	 up	 and	 told	 them	 someone	 spotted Wayne	in	the	office.	There	were	only	a	few	of	them	and	they	took	off	running, </p>
<p class="calibre1">called	it	in,	I	guess.	I	just	walked	away.”	Sara	laughs,	still	freaked	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	you	saw	it?	The	helicopter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nods.	“You	sure	you’re	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 picture	 the	 crash,	 the	 explosion.	 “I	 only	 had	 one	 shot	 and...	 They’re	 still trying	to	get	him	out	from...he’s	trapped...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	see	the	pilot’s	hand	reaching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe,	you	didn’t	have	a	choice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	finally	look	back	and	see	the	huge	cloud	of	black	smoke.	It’s	still	rising.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear	the	sirens.	The	ambulance	must	have	arrived.	They’re	going	to	have	to	cut</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	the	metal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe,	come	on,	we	have	to	hurry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I’m	moving	back	towards	the	wreckage.	Sara	yanks	my	arm.	“What	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	doing?”	She	spins	me	a	little.	“Joe?	Hey,	listen	to	me.”	She	grabs	my	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	to	get	to	Danny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	 with	 her	 holding	 my	 face,	 I	 can’t	 stop	 looking	 at	 the	 black	 smoke rising	up	from	the	carnage,	the	flesh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe!	 Come	 on!”	 She’s	 pulling	 me,	 but	 I’m	 fighting	 it.	 She	 says,	 “Danny</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>needs	us.	He	needs	you,	Joe.	He’s	your	friend,	remember?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	like	I’ve	just	been	slapped	awake.	“Right.	Yeah...	Sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	start	for	the	woods,	holding	tight	to	the	image	of	Danny,	of	Wayne.	I	tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself	not	to	look	back,	just	get	to	the	cave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 sun’s	 halfway	 under	 the	 horizon.	 Streaks	 of	 red	 splash	 across	 the	 sky and	dissolve	into	the	darkness	of	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	can	hardly	see	and	am	unsure	which	way	to	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe,	what	are	you	doing?	Why	are	you	stopping?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	remember.”	I	look	left	and	it	seems	kind	of	familiar,	but	so	does	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">right.	But	it’s	all	just	trees	and	snow	and	I	have	no	fucking	clue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe!”	Sara	shakes	me.	“Relax,	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	trying,	but	she’s	still	shaking	me.	Finally	she	stops. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	clear	your	head	and	think.	Which	way	is	the	mine?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 close	 my	 eyes,	 try	 to	 remember	 the	 first	 time	 I	 found	 it,	 the	 huge	 tree crashing	down	and	uncovering	the	entrance.	I	picture	the	rusted	metal	tracks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	come	on,	focus.	Where	were	you	before	the	mine?”	Sara	asks.	She’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">pissed	and	needs	me	to	get	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 remember	 I	 just	 got	 off	 the	 phone	 with	 Mom.	 She’d	 said	 my	 father	 had turned	me	in	and	I	just	started	running,	lost	one	of	my	shoes	in	the	snow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	takes	me	a	second	then	suddenly	it’s	clear.	“I	went	to	the	tree!”	The	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	 I’d	 carved	 Michelle	 and	 Rachel’s	 names,	 which	 later	 I	 scratched	 out because	I	can’t	stop	hurting	every	woman	I	meet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	 doesn’t	 have	 time	 for	 my	 bullshit,	 but	 it	 reminds	 me	 it’s	 not	 too	 far from	their	names. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	take	off	running,	and	the	shotgun	starts	to	slide	out	of	my	jacket.	I	pull	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">out,	 carry	 it	 in	 one	 hand.	 The	 snow	 is	 halfway	 up	 our	 shins,	 but	 we	 keep plodding.	 Even	 when	 Sara	 gets	 stuck,	 I	 grab	 her	 hand	 and	 pull.	 Twenty	 more yards,	the	carving	just	visible.	We	just	need	to	angle	right,	then	head	up	the	hill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fallen	tree	is	at	the	bottom,	wedged	against	a	few	towering	pines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 up	 here,”	 I	 say	 and	 help	 Sara	 keep	 her	 balance	 up	 the	 rocky,	 snow-covered	slope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 cave	 is	 still	 covered	 by	 rocks.	 Completely	 untouched.	 But	 there’s	 no one	 here.	 Sharon	 and	 the	 others	 should	 be	 waiting,	 that	 was	 the	 plan.	 I	 walk around	 the	 cave,	 looking	 into	 the	 woods.	 The	 gunmetal	 is	 freezing	 on	 my	 bare hand,	so	I	set	it	against	the	rocks	and	keep	looking	around.	Sharon	and	the	others must	 have	 seen	 the	 helicopter	 crash,	 or	 at	 least	 heard	 it.	 I	 start	 to	 wonder	 if they’ve	 already	 escaped,	 but	 they	 couldn’t	 have	 put	 back	 the	 rocks.	 They’re covered	with	too	much	snow. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a>I	tell	Sara	it	doesn’t	make	any	sense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara’s	 not	 paying	 attention.	 She’s	 looking	 at	 the	 trees,	 turning	 around	 in circles,	anxious	and	panicked.	I	know	she’s	not	talking	about	Sharon	when	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">asks,	“Where	are	they?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 tell	 her	 to	 be	 quiet.	 There’s	 something	 coming	 from	 far	 away.	 It	 sounds like	gunshots,	but	it’s	too	faint	to	be	sure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	voice	rings	out.	“Sara.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">”Danny?”	 Sara	 turns	 around	 and	 calls	 his	 name	 again,	 but	 there’s	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">answer.	Seconds	tick	by	and	I	start	thinking	I’m	going	insane. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 Wayne,	 with	 a	 knife	 to	 Danny’s	 throat,	 comes	 walking	 out	 of	 the trees.	Wayne’s	eyes	dart	around	the	forest.	He	sees	we’re	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny’s	pencil	is	gone,	fist	empty,	his	thumb	rubbing	up	and	down	on	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">knuckle.	His	eyes	are	filled	with	tears	ready	to	burst	and	stream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	him	go!”	Sara	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	just	brings	the	knife	closer	to	Danny’s	neck.	They’re	in	the	shadows</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	it’s	too	dark	to	see,	but	Danny’s	gasp	says	the	blade’s	piercing	skin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop	it!	You’re	hurting	him!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne’s	 jaw	 clenches	 under	 that	 nasty	 beard,	 his	 eyes	 gleaming	 at	 me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shut	her	fucking	mouth	or	I	take	the	retard’s	head.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	starts	for	Wayne,	but	I	pull	her	back,	tell	her	to	stay	calm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wayne,”	I	say,	“now,	we	had	a	deal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I’m	aware.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	I	did	my	part	so	let	Danny	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	sticks	out	his	neck,	swivels	it	left	then	right.	“I	don’t	see	the	rest	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	party?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	where	they’re	at.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	you	broke	the	deal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	said	I	had	to	take	out	the	helicopter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	that	Zen	cunt	told	you	to	do	that.	I	said	you	had	to	convince	her	to	let</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	tag	along.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	where	she	is!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	you	didn’t	live	up	to	your	part	of	the	bargain.”	Wayne	takes	a	fistful</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	Danny’s	hair	and	snaps	back	his	head,	the	knife	pressing	hard	against	Danny’s throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please,”	Sara	says.	“Please	don’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wayne,	 you	 don’t	 need	 to	 do	 this.”	 I’m	 trying	 to	 keep	 my	 voice	 steady. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	don’t	even	need	Sharon.	We	can	go	on	our	own.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	clicks	his	tongue.	“Yeah,	I	don’t	like	that	idea.	Unless	you	got	a	car</p>
<p class="calibre1">waiting?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a>There’s	 no	 point	 in	 lying,	 not	 with	 Wayne,	 so	 I	 tell	 him	 I	 don’t.	 But	 I remind	him	we’re	out	of	options.	The	helicopter’s	down,	but	another	one	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 here	 any	 minute.	 So	 unless	 he	 wants	 to	 head	 back	 and	 turn	 himself	 in,	 we need	to	go	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	 mulls	 it	 over.	 I	 know	 he’s	 going	 to	 slit	 Danny’s	 throat	 no	 matter what,	so	I	keep	my	eyes	locked	on	his.	I	don’t	even	blink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	kill	him,”	I	say,	“and	I’m	not	lifting	a	fucking	stone.	And	there’s	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	you’ll	get	down	by	yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	 laughs.	 “Momma’s	 Boy	 wants	 to	 be	 a	 man.”	 Wayne	 turns	 towards</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara,	the	tip	of	his	tongue	sliding	over	his	lips.		“Maybe	I’ll	just	stick	here,	enjoy your	lady.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	blow	out	Wayne’s	sick	fantasy.	“We’re	running	out	of	time.	We	can	do	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">quicker	with	Danny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	 seems	 disappointed.	 He	 lets	 Danny	 go	 with	 a	 shove.	 Danny	 runs</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	Sara’s	arms.	She	squeezes	him	with	everything	she’s	got,	pats	his	hair,	asks if	he’s	alright.	Danny	gulps	and	nods.	She	checks	his	neck.	It’s	bleeding,	but	not bad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	let’s	get	to	work,”	Wayne	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	look	to	Sara	and	tell	her	to	go	on,	let	her	know	this	is	our	only	play.	Danny</p>
<p class="calibre1">moves	 to	 the	 cave	 and	 starts	 pulling	 away	 rocks.	 Sara	 and	 I	 help	 while	 Wayne wipes	the	bloody	knife	on	his	shirt.	I	drop	a	rock	and	look	at	Wayne,	ask	him	if he’s	going	to	just	stand	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	 slides	 the	 knife	 in	 his	 belt	 and	 lifts	 a	 huge	 stone.	 I	 can	 tell	 it’s hurting	his	back,	but	he	turns	and	chucks	it	to	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	 tries	 to	 lift	 a	 big	 one,	 too,	 but	 can’t.	 She	 starts	 to	 move	 to	 a	 smaller rock,	 but	 I	 tell	 Danny	 to	 help	 his	 sister.	 He’s	 got	 a	 small	 stick	 in	 his	 fist	 but works	 around	 it,	 grabs	 one	 end	 of	 the	 rock	 and	 they	 pry	 it	 out,	 both	 of	 them stepping	sideways	a	few	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne’s	staring	at	me.	I	just	lift	another	huge	rock,	focus	my	thoughts	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	weight.	I	drop	it	as	Sara	and	Danny	drop	theirs.	Then	I	see	my	opportunity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	and	Danny	are	out	of	the	way.	I	run	and	grab	the	shotgun,	but	before	I	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">even	take	aim,	Wayne	says,	“Now,	Joe,	why	do	you	have	to	complicate	things.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still,	I	point	the	hollow	end	right	at	his	face	and	wedge	myself	in	between</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	and	Danny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne’s	cocking	his	head,	sizing	me	up.	He	says,	“Momma	didn’t	raise	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">killer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fuck	you,	Wayne.	I	already	broke	my	cherry.”	I’m	trying	to	sound	tough, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	Wayne’s	inside	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	rubs	his	beard.	“But	you	didn’t	like	the	taste,	did	you?”	Wayne	narrows</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p171"></a>his	eyes.	He’s	burrowing	around	inside	me.	“How’d	you	do	it,	Joe?	How’d	you take	down	that	chopper?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	trying	to	hum,	to	block	it	all	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 look	 those	 men	 in	 the	 eye,	 like	 your	 daddy	 told	 you?	 Huh?”	 A	 grin spreads	 over	 Wayne’s	 face.	 “Or	 did	 you	 wait	 until	 they	 were	 down	 below	 and shoot	them	in	the	back?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	can’t	get	the	pilot	out	of	my	head	fast	enough.	I’m	humming	as	loud	as	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">can,	and	Wayne’s	still	grinning.	I	tell	him	to	back	up,	but	he	just	keeps	coming, not	even	moving	his	hands,	just	presses	his	chest	against	the	barrel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne’s	breath	pours	over	my	face	and	I	jab	him	with	the	gun	to	push	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">back,	 but	 Wayne	 leans	 in	 so	 I’m	 practically	 holding	 him	 up,	 the	 hollow	 end digging	into	his	ribs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	right	here,	Joe.	What’s	it	going	to	be?	You	a	coward	or	man?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hear	my	father’s	voice	telling	me	to	stop	being	such	a	goddamn	baby,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne’s	laughing.	My	finger’s	on	the	trigger.	I	can	feel	it	fine	against	my	skin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Wayne	keeps	leaning,	his	eyes	wide	and	psychotic.	I	just	can’t	squeeze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne	grabs	the	barrel,	swipes	it	away	from	his	chest.	I’m	holding	onto	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">butt	of	the	gun,	both	of	us	yanking,	pulling,	grunting.	Then	Wayne	gets	his	other hand	 on	 the	 gun	 and	 slams	 me	 into	 the	 rocks,	 knocking	 everything	 out	 of	 me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s	 using	 both	 hands,	 one	 on	 each	 end	 of	 the	 shotgun,	 forcing	 it	 against	 my throat.	I	push	back	on	the	barrel,	and	Wayne	pulls	me	away	from	the	rocks	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">crushes	me	back	against	them,	my	head	smacking,	nearly	splitting.	My	legs	give</p>
<p class="calibre1">out,	 but	 he’s	 holding	 me	 up	 with	 the	 Mossberg	 on	 my	 neck,	 cutting	 off	 air.	 I close	my	eyes	and	try	to	kick,	but	Wayne	throws	out	his	knee	and	blocks	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look	at	me,	Joe.	This	is	how	you	do	it.	You	look	them	right	in	the	eye—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny’s	roar	only	lasts	a	second,	but	it’s	enough	to	get	Wayne	to	turn,	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	time	to	see	Danny’s	hands	coming	at	him.	The	stick	punches	through	Wayne’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">cheek,	Danny’s	fingers	digging	into	Wayne’s	eyes.	They	spin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Mossberg	flies	out	of	Wayne’s	grasp	and	cracks	against	a	rock.	I’m	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	fours	sucking	air.	Wayne	and	Danny	are	pulling	and	pushing	and	punching,	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">snarling	 violence	 that	 collapses	 to	 the	 ground,	 probably	 close	 enough	 to	 touch, but	I	can’t	lift	my	head	to	know	for	sure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne’s	laugh	almost	covers	the	sliding	of	metal	on	leather.	Sara	screams.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">look	up	and	see	Wayne	holding	the	knife	high	above	his	head,	ready	to	drive	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	 Danny’s	 chest.	 I	 look	 for	 the	 gun,	 but	 can’t	 find	 it.	 It’s	 somewhere buried	 in	 the	 snow.	 So	 I	 dive	 into	 Wayne.	 We	 start	 tumbling,	 rolling	 down	 the hill.	This	sharp	pain	carves	into	my	side,	but	I	can’t	tell	if	it’s	the	knife	or	just	a rock.	Finally,	we	stop	rolling	and	Wayne	crawls	on	top	of	me,	a	ragged	hole	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 cheek.	 Spit	 falls	 from	 his	 lips	 and	 onto	 mine.	 He	 wipes	 the	 snow	 from	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a>hair	and	sniffs,	sucking	up	blood	and	snot.	He	flips	the	knife	around	in	his	hand so	he	can	get	a	better	grip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please,”	I	hear	my	voice	squeak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wayne’s	 thinking	 how	 good	 it’s	 going	 to	 feel	 to	 slice	 through	 me.	 The cartilage	and	fibers	shredding	and	spraying	blood	like	warm	rain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 comes	 the	  <i class="calibre4">crack! </i>	 And	 I	 see	 the	 hole	 in	 Wayne’s	 head,	 all	 dark	 and hollow.	 It’s	 about	 the	 size	 of	 a	 dime.	 Wayne’s	 eyes	 are	 focused	 on	 something behind	 me	 until	 there’s	 no	 focus	 at	 all.	 He	 falls	 to	 his	 side,	 his	 face	 half-swallowed	by	the	snow,	which	dissolves	and	turns	crimson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 force	 off	 his	 legs	 and	 expect	 to	 see	 Danny	 or	 Sara	 with	 the	 shotgun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead,	I	see	Sheriff	Melvin,	Sharon	and	about	forty	other	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Melvin	 is	 holding	 a	 revolver.	 His	 uniform	 is	 covered	 in	 blood.	 Same	 goes for	a	half	dozen	of	the	Brightsiders.	They	look	like	they’ve	just	been	through	a war,	bruised	and	broken,	their	bodies	still	carrying	fragments	of	lead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Melvin	stands	over	me	and	asks,	“Can	you	get	up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,	‘cause	I	ain’t	carrying	your	ass.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 get	 to	 my	 knees	 and	 feel	 the	 pain	 shooting	 down	 my	 side.	 My	 jacket	 is torn	and	I	unzip	it,	peer	in	and	see	the	blood.	My	fingers	feel	the	wound	and	it’s not	very	deep.	The	jacket	took	most	of	the	damage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	and	Sara	run	over	and	help	me	to	my	feet.	Sara	asks	if	I’m	okay	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tell	her	I’m	fine.	Danny	keeps	apologizing	for	not	stopping	Wayne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	okay,	Danny,”	I	say.	“You	saved	my	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	simple	joy	returns	to	Danny’s	eyes.	“I	did	good?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	real	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	walk	back	to	the	cave	where	the	Brightsiders	are	ripping	down	the	rest</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	rocks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	gets	in	my	face.	“Who	knows	about	this	place?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	one,	just	Sara	and	Danny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	looks	at	Wayne’s	lifeless	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	say,	“And	him,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	 doesn’t	 find	 it	 funny.	 Apparently,	 her	 little	 club	 has	 a	 leak.	 The Boots	found	out	about	the	escape.	There	was	gunfire	in	the	Square.	A	few	people</p>
<p class="calibre1">died. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe,	 I	 need	 you	 to	 think	 about	 this	 real	 hard,”	 Sharon	 says.	 “Is	 there anyone	else	that’s	not	here	who	knows	about	the	cave?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rachel	knew,	but	she’s	dead.	Same	went	for	Robert. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	tell	another	soul. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	anyone	see	you	on	the	roof?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a>“A	 couple	 of	 people,	 but	 no	 one	 could’ve	 known	 about	 this	 place.	 They were	down	on	the	sidewalk.	They	only	saw	me	fire	the	shot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	afterwards?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	picture	the	stairs,	the	office,	the	elevator.	That	big	paw	waving	me	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bathroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon’s	face	squinches	up.	“Wendell?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	 but	 I	 didn’t	 tell	 him	 anything.	 He	 already	 knew.	 He	 heard	 it	 from someone.	But	he	didn’t	tell	anyone,	at	least	not	after	he	saw	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	how	do	you	know	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	he’s	dead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Still,	he	heard	it	from	someone?	Who?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,	Sharon.	Could	be	anyone.	I	mean,	this	operation	isn’t	exactly</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	well-oiled	machine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon	glares	at	me	then	walks	over	to	the	cave.	“Alright	everyone,	listen</p>
<p class="calibre1">up!	We’ve	got	ten	minutes	to	get	off	this	mountain	or	else	our	ride	is	gone.	So</p>
<p class="calibre1">let’s	move!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharon’s	 chosen	 ones	 keep	 hurling	 rocks.	 A	 few	 have	 torches,	 which	 they douse	with	gasoline.	Carlos	and	some	guy	who	works	at	the	deli	carry	this	giant</p>
<p class="calibre1">spooled	up	ladder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	says,	“I	wanna	help.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	tells	him	okay	and	Danny	heads	over	to	the	cave	and	starts	chucking</p>
<p class="calibre1">rocks.	Sara	looks	at	my	torn	jacket,	but	doesn’t	ask	about	the	cut.	She’s	listening to	 my	 thoughts	 about	 Wendell,	 another	 unlucky	 soul	 who	 made	 the	 mistake	 of running	into	me.	He	didn’t	need	to	die.	He	was	just	trying	to	help	me,	even	after all	the	awful	shit	he	heard	me	think	about	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	going	to	be	okay.	It	will,”	Sara	says.	“We’re	getting	out	of	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	lucky	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	Wendell	wanted	was	for	me	to	help	his	sister,	Becky.	He	gave	up	his	life</p>
<p class="calibre1">because	I	promised	him	I	would. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe,	you	need	to	let	it	go.	We	only	have	ten	minutes	to	get	out	of	here.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">girl	will	be	fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No...”	Once	we’re	gone,	the	people	left	behind	will	never	be	safe.	They’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">lock	it	down	and	turn	it	into	a	zoo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carlos	 and	 the	 guy	 from	 the	 deli	 set	 down	 the	 spooled	 up	 ladder.	 I	 walk over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carlos	looks	up	and	says,	“Joe!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 don’t	 have	 time	 for	 him.	 I	 say	 to	 the	 other	 guy,	 “Do	 you	 know	 Becky? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wendell’s	sister?	She	works	with	you,	I	think.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	says	he	does,	feels	like	shit	about	it.	The	girl’s	only	sixteen.	She	has	no</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a>one	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	know	where	she	is?	Where	I	can	find	her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	 was	 at	 the	 deli	 earlier,	 but	 there’s	 a	 curfew	 now.	 Might	 be	 at	 home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lodge	Two,	I	think.	Yeah.	Second	floor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nod	and	turn	back.	Sara’s	right	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe,	come	on,	let’s	just	go	help	Danny,	okay?”	Sara	takes	my	arm.	But	I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	going	with	her.	I’m	looking	for	the	shotgun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	crazy?	If	you	go	back	there	with	a	gun,	they’ll	kill	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara’s	 right,	 I	 have	 to	 go	 unarmed.	 One	 shotgun	 isn’t	 going	 to	 stop	 every Boot.	It’s	only	going	to	draw	them	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe,	please	don’t	do	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 look	 at	 the	 cave.	 They’re	 only	 halfway	 done	 with	 the	 rocks.	 I’m	 already backing	down	the	hill.	Sara	begs	me	to	stay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tell	her,	“I’ll	be	back	in	time.	I	promise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah?	And	if	you’re	not?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	leave	and	don’t	look	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	is	still	yelling	as	I	take	off	into	the	woods.	I’m	running	down	the	hill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trees	 fly	 by	 and	 I	 jump	 over	 a	 log,	 dodge	 holes,	 angle	 left	 at	 my	 carvings.	 I pump	my	arms	as	fast	as	they	go.	The	pond	is	less	than	twenty	yards	away.	My</p>
<p class="calibre1">left	 foot	 slides	 out	 beneath	 me	 and	 gets	 caught	 on	 something	 in	 the	 snow,	 my ankle	 cracking.	 It’s	 not	 broken,	 but	 it’s	 definitely	 sprained.	 I	 don’t	 have	 long before	it	swells.	I	put	most	of	the	pressure	on	my	right	leg,	but	keep	moving.	My left	foot	barely	touches	the	ground	as	I	head	towards	the	Square. </p>

<p class="calibre1">out,	glass	scattered	beneath	them.	I	make	it	to	the	Square.	The	streets	are	so	quiet and	empty	it’s	creepy.	It	must	be	because	of	the	curfew,	which	makes	me	realize</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying	the	deli	is	pointless.	No	one	is	going	to	be	there	so	I	head	for	Lodge	Two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	have	to	cross	the	street,	but	otherwise	I	try	to	stay	up	against	the	buildings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	 a	 Boot	 up	 ahead.	 He’s	 scraping	 something	 off	 his	 sole.	 Gum	 or something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 crouch	 as	 low	 as	 I	 can	 without	 putting	 my	 ass	 on	 the	 ground.	 It	 puts pressure	on	my	ankle,	but	I	can’t	be	seen.	The	Boot	is	hopping	on	one	leg,	losing his	 balance.	 I	 slip	 around	 the	 corner,	 cross	 in	 between	 two	 buildings.	 I	 start	 to take	a	left	when	I	hear	this	faint	buzzing	sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	 a	 security	 camera	 somewhere.	 They	 must	 have	 realized	 most	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	had	been	disabled.	I	wonder	how	many	are	back	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	a	fence	to	the	left.	It’s	about	five	feet	high.	I	check	both	ways	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">take	 off	 and	 run,	 but	 my	 ankle	 gives	 out.	 My	 hand	 goes	 to	 the	 pavement.	 I’m completely	exposed	so	I	spring	up	and	hobble	onto	the	grass.	I	climb	the	fence, </p>
<p class="calibre1">flinging	my	body	over	the	top	and	land	on	my	side	to	protect	my	ankle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lodge	 Two	 is	 just	 over	 a	 small	 hill.	 I	 creep	 towards	 it,	 see	 two	 Boots	 out front.	 They’re	 armed	 and	 trying	 to	 look	 real	 serious,	 even	 though	 no	 one	 is around.	 I	 figure	 there	 must	 be	 a	 camera	 on	 the	 front	 door.	 They’re	 being watched,	which	means	I	need	to	find	another	way	in.	I	swoop	around	towards	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">side	and	look	up	at	the	second	floor.	There’s	no	way	I	could	climb	up,	even	with two	good	ankles.	But	the	first	floor	offers	opportunity.	There’s	a	window	and	it’s slightly	open,	which	is	odd	in	this	cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	move	closer	and	hear	voices	inside	the	apartment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	woman	says,	“I	told	you	I	was	sick.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	man	says,	“Oh,	believe	me	I	know,	and	it’s	disgusting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 duck	 walk	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 way,	 praying	 there	 isn’t	 a	 camera.	 I	 get	 to	 the ledge	and	slowly	lift	my	head	up	over	the	sill.	The	living	room	is	empty,	just	the same	 shitty	 furniture	 as	 every	 apartment	 in	 Brightside.	 The	 bedroom	 door	 is closed	and	so	is	the	bathroom.	They	both	have	lights	on,	which	spills	out	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	doors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	breath	is	streaming	fog	and	I	can	barely	feel	my	fingers.	I	look	at	my</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a>watch.	 I	 only	 have	 five	 minutes	 to	 make	 it	 back.	 I’m	 already	 behind	 schedule and	I	haven’t	even	made	it	to	the	second	floor.	Instinct	tells	me	to	turn	back.	I can	 still	 make	 it	 if	 I	 hurry,	 but	 Wendell	 keeps	 popping	 into	 my	 head.	 His	 big giant	body	splayed	on	the	wet	bathroom	floor.	The	holes	in	his	chest,	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	window	gives	the	slightest	creak	as	I	lift	it	a	few	inches.	Luckily,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">couple	 is	 still	 arguing	 from	 different	 rooms.	 I	 don’t	 think	 they	 can	 even	 hear each	other	because	they’re	saying	the	same	thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 press	 up	 on	 my	 right	 foot	 and	 hoist	 myself	 through.	 My	 stupid	 coat	 is getting	stuck	so	I	have	to	wiggle	a	bit.	I	nearly	propel	my	face	to	the	floor,	but my	hands	spring	out	and	soften	the	blow.	I’m	heading	for	the	front	door	when	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear	a	flush. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 knob	 begins	 to	 turn	 and	 I	 nearly	 trip	 over	 the	 coffee	 table,	 my	 hand frantically	reaching	out	for	the	door.	The	bathroom	light	flicks	off	and	I	turn	the knob,	slip	out	just	in	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	hallway’s	empty.	The	stairs	are	at	the	other	end.	I	hobble	and	hurry	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">use	the	handrail	to	keep	weight	off	my	left	foot.	There	are	at	least	eight	doors	on the	second	floor,	and	I	have	no	idea	which	one	is	Becky’s.	I	don’t	have	time	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">try	 them	 all,	 so	 I	 just	 knock	 on	 the	 first	 one.	 A	 middle-aged	 woman,	 with	 dry, frizzy	hair,	answers.	I	think	I’ve	seen	her	washing	dishes	at	the	diner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	looking	for	Becky,”	I	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	Becky	lives	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	but	she’s	on	this	floor.	Do	you	know	which	one	is	hers?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 woman	 scratches	 her	 scalp	 and	 something	 comes	 off	 in	 her	 nail.	 She pinches	it	and	studies	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please.	Her	name’s	Becky.	Wendell’s	sister?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,”	she	says,	drawing	out	the	word	like	it	has	fifteen	letters.	“Yeah,	weird</p>
<p class="calibre1">girl.	She’s	over	there.”	The	woman	points	to	the	last	door	on	the	right.	There’s still	a	piece	of	scab	under	her	nail.	I	tell	her	thanks	and	start	hobbling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	floor	seems	so	familiar,	but	I	can’t	remember	ever	being	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knock	on	the	last	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 girl	 says,	 “I’m	 in	 bed.”	 She	 sounds	 frightened,	 like	 she’s	 been	 caught doing	something	bad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Becky,	I’m	a	friend	of	your	brother’s.	Please,	just	come	to	the	door.”	I	hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	moving	around.	I	also	see	the	middle-aged	woman	peering	out	her	door.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	long	as	she’s	peering,	she’s	not	calling	the	Boots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	the	door	opens	and	I	see	Becky,	a	frail,	freckle-faced	girl	with	big</p>
<p class="calibre1">brown	eyes	that	look	like	she’s	been	crying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	know	me,”	I	say,	“but	your	brother	sent	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	brother’s	dead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a>“Yeah,	I	know,	and	I’m	sorry,	but	he	asked	me	to	make	sure...	Can	I	come in?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	 like	 she	 knows	 she’s	 being	 watched.	 She	 says,	 “No.	 I	 can’t	 have visitors.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I’m	not	trying	to	get	you	in	trouble,	but	your	brother	asked	me	to	come	get</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">you. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Why? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">So	you	can	leave	Brightside	for	good. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I...don’t	know	what	you’re	talking	about.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	know	she’s	lying,	but	she’s	also	scared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 starts	 to	 close	 the	 door,	 but	 I	 block	 with	 my	 left	 foot,	 pain	 ripping through	my	ankle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	grit	my	teeth.  <i class="calibre4">He	risked	his	life	for	me,	Becky.	He	did	it	so	I	could	escape</i> <i class="calibre4">and	so	you	could,	too.	Your	brother	wanted	you	to	get	out.	He	made	me	promise</i> <i class="calibre4">I’d	come	get	you.	Now,	I	can’t	force	you	to	do	anything,	but	I	gave	Wendell	my</i> <i class="calibre4">word.	I	owe	him.	That’s	why	I’m	here.	But	you	have	to	make	up	your	own	mind</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">and	it	has	to	be	right	now.	We	don’t	have	any	more	time. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Becky	 stares	 at	 nothing,	 trying	 to	 process	 what	 I’m	 telling	 her,	 but	 she’s also	thinking	about	Wendell.	She	knows	her	brother	would’ve	done	anything	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">help	her	escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	behind	me	opens	and	I	hear	this	awful	voice	I	know	too	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">“</i> What	the	fuck	are	you	doing	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	it	all	comes	back.	Lodge	Two,	second	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stay	focused.  <i class="calibre4">So	what’s	it	going	to	be,	Becky? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	shit.”	Krystal	laughs.	“You’re	a	fucking	pervert.	She’s	sixteen!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Becky,	you	have	to	decide	right	now.	Yes	or	no? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Becky	keeps	staring	at	the	floor.	She’s	unable	or	unwilling	to	comprehend</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	I’m	saying.	I	start	to	think	this	is	a	mistake.	Here	I	am	trying	to	convince	a girl	 I’ve	 never	 met	 to	 run	 off	 with	 me	 into	 the	 woods.	 And	 Sharon’s	 ride	 is probably	already	here,	about	to	leave,	and	I’m	going	to	miss	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	then	Becky	looks	up	with	those	big	brown	eyes	and	nods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	silently	tell	her	to	get	her	coat,	that	we’re	already	late.	She	asks	if	she	can pack	a	bag	and	I	tell	her	there’s	no	time.	Sharon’s	club	is	leaving	as	we	speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shouldn’t	have	thought	it,	regretted	it	the	moment	it	flew	out	of	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 the	 ones	 causing	 this	 shit?”	 Krystal’s	 voice	 fills	 the	 entire	 lodge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	why	we	have	a	curfew?	So	you	idiots	can	try	to	escape?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal	is	shoving	me,	prodding	her	fingers	into	the	back	of	my	head.	Other</p>
<p class="calibre1">doors	start	opening,	people	popping	out	to	see	what’s	going	on.	I	try	not	to	look</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a>at	them,	but	I	catch	a	young	man’s	eyes.	He	wants	to	know	if	it’s	true.	If	there really	is	a	way	off	this	mountain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	don’t	mean	to	picture	the	pond,	the	carvings	in	the	tree,	the	hill,	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cave,	or	maybe	I	do.	I	have	no	clue	what	I’m	doing	anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	another	familiar	sound,	far	worse	than	Krystal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	faint	sound	of	bootsteps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	they’re	getting	louder	and	louder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 jump	 into	 Becky’s	 room,	 slam	 the	 door,	 lock	 it.	 Krystal’s	 banging	 and screaming	and	telling	everyone	the	traitor	is	right	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Becky	 puts	 on	 her	 coat,	 her	 boots.	 I	 hobble	 to	 the	 window	 and	 open	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	are	some	bushes	and	it	looks	like	a	snow	bank	has	blown	up	against	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Krystal’s	outside	the	door	telling	the	Boots	to	hurry	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	take	Becky’s	hand,	tell	her	it’s	going	to	be	okay.	She	ducks	her	head	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	window	and	slips	out	first,	her	fingers	gripping	the	sill.	She’s	terrified. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	okay.	Just	jump.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Words	I	never	thought	would	ever	leave	my	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Becky	lets	go	and	falls,	and	I	stick	my	head	out	to	see	her	lying	on	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">back.	I	can’t	tell	if	she’s	breathing,	but	then	she	smiles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 key	 slips	 into	 the	 lock.	 The	 bolt	 turns.	 I	 stick	 my	 leg	 through	 the window,	duck	under	and	look	back	to	see	the	doorknob	turn.	I	let	go.	Just	falling in	the	dark.	The	snow	breaks	my	fall,	but	not	really.	I’m	heavier	than	Becky	and she	already	smashed	a	lot	of	the	powder.	I	can	barely	breathe,	but	I	pull	myself up,	keep	most	of	my	weight	on	my	right	foot	as	we	run	for	the	park. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	running,	hobbling	down	the	path,	shouting	for	Becky	to	keep	up.	I	hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">voices	in	the	distance.	Someone	says	we’re	heading	for	the	trees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 take	 Becky’s	 hand	 so	 we	 don’t	 get	 separated.	 She’s	 so	 light	 she’s	 not sinking	in	the	snow	like	I	am	when	we	step	off	the	path	and	into	the	woods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	practically	drag	her	between	two	enormous	pines,	the	needles	scratching</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	faces	and	clothes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	yells,	“Stop	right	there!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	don’t	look	back,	just	keep	moving	as	fast	as	my	ankle	will	let	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	they	going	to	shoot	us?”	Becky	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	I	tell	her.	“They	have	to	warn	us	first.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 cloud	 slides	 over	 the	 moon	 and	 I	 can	 hardly	 see	 all	 the	 rocks	 and	 dead logs.	I	nearly	trip.	So	does	Becky.	I	say,	“Keep	going,	that’s	all	we	have	to	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	think	I	see	the	tree	with	my	carvings,	but	I	can’t	be	sure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gunfire	erupts	behind	us,	bullets	blowing	through	branches	on	both	sides. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	much	for	a	warning. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p179"></a>Another	 bullet	 whizzes	 by.	 It’s	 so	 close	 my	 entire	 body	 is	 covered	 with goose	bumps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carvings	 or	 not,	 I	 yank	 us	 right.	 My	 ankle’s	 practically	 numb	 from	 the snow	 and	 we	 sprint	 through	 a	 bunch	 of	 trees	 and	 start	 moving	 up	 the	 hill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Becky’s	frail,	but	she’s	a	fighter,	keeps	churning,	running,	even	when	it	sounds like	she’s	about	to	have	an	asthma	attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Other	 than	 her	 labored	 breaths,	 I	 don’t	 hear	 anything.	 No	 more	 shots.	 I wonder	 if	 we	 somehow	 lost	 them.	 It’s	 only	 thirty	 yards	 to	 the	 cave.	 I	 squeeze Becky’s	hand	and	keep	pulling	her	up	the	hill	until	we	hit	the	rubble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	look	back	expecting	to	see	a	dozen	Boots	storming	like	it’s	the	beaches	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Normandy,	but	no	one	seems	to	be	coming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	realize	Wayne’s	body	is	missing,	too.	I	know	he	didn’t	just	stand	up	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">walk	away	though.	I	saw	the	bullet	enter	his	psychotic	brain.	There’s	a	three-foot wide	path	that	leads	to	the	trees.	The	Brightsiders	must	have	dragged	him	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	keep	the	Boots	off	our	trail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	lift	Becky	over	the	few	remaining	rocks	blocking	the	cave,	set	her	down	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	this?”	Becky	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	silently	tell	her	to	be	quiet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	 not	 holding	 her	 hand,	 but	 I	 know	 she’s	 trembling.	 I	 reach	 into	 my pocket	for	my	keys,	but	my	fingers	are	so	frozen	I	can’t	keep	a	grip.	They	clang on	 the	 ground.	 I	 kneel,	 put	 my	 hands	 on	 the	 cold	 dirt	 and	 sweep	 around	 and around	until	I	hear	a	jingle.	I	pick	up	the	keys	and	hold	them	in	front	of	my	face, but	I	can’t	see	anything	but	black. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I	wanna	go	home</i>,	Becky	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Hold	on... </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny’s	little	flashlight	clicks	and	shines	across	the	ground.	I	see	the	rusty</p>
<p class="calibre1">steel	tracks.  <i class="calibre4">We	just	have	to	follow	these.	Come	on</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Becky	wraps	her	hands	around	my	arm	and	we	start	moving.	The	wooden</p>
<p class="calibre1">beams	 creak	 as	 we	 descend	 down	 the	 belly	 of	 the	 mountain.	 The	 tunnel	 splits after	a	few	hundred	yards.	I	take	us	right.	I	silently	tell	Becky	what	part	of	the mountain	 we’re	 walking	 under,	 even	 though	 I’m	 not	 entirely	 sure.	 I	 just	 know she	loosens	her	grip	a	little.	She	asks	if	this	could	collapse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Out	loud,	she	asks,	“How	would	anyone	find	us	if	it	does—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	cover	her	mouth.	There’s	someone	coming.	They’re	a	ways	behind	us,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	that	far. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 silently	 tell	 Becky	 we	 have	 to	 run.	 I’m	 pretty	 sure	 she’s	 nodding	 even though	 I	 can’t	 see	 her	 face.	 I	 quicken	 our	 pace,	 remind	 her	 to	 tread	 lightly,	 to keep	quiet,	even	though	I	can’t.	The	numbness	in	my	ankle	has	worn	off,	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p180"></a>pain	is	searing.	I	keep	dragging	my	left	foot	no	matter	how	much	I	try	not	to.	It’s scrapping	across	the	rocks	and	dirt	and	echoing	so	loud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Becky	takes	the	flashlight,	which	lets	me	balance	better.	I	put	one	hand	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">How	much	farther? </i>	she	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 honestly	 don’t	 remember.	 It’s	 been	 two	 weeks	 since	 I’ve	 stepped	 foot	 in the	mineshaft,	but	I	don’t	think	we	have	far	to	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	the	Boots	are	getting	closer.	I	can’t	tell	how	many	of	them	there	are,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	really	doesn’t	matter	since	I	don’t	have	the	shotgun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly,	more	voices.	Familiar	ones.	But	not	from	behind.	They’re	just	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">ahead.	I	see	the	end	of	the	rope	ladder	anchored	into	steel	plates	under	the	tracks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each	rung	gets	a	bit	brighter.	The	exit	to	the	mine	is	ten	yards	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	we	have	company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	and	Sara	are	standing	at	the	edge,	a	hundred	stars	twinkling	behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">them.	It’s	the	most	beautiful	sight	I’ve	ever	seen,	but	I’m	still	mad.  <i class="calibre4">	What	are	you</i> <i class="calibre4">doing	here? </i>	I	ask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	slam	my	hand	over	Danny’s	mouth	and	turn	back	to	the	darkness.	I	can’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell	if	the	Boots	are	moving	quicker	or	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turn	to	Sara.  <i class="calibre4">I	told	you	to	go. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Danny	refused. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Yeah,	I	refused. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	step	up	to	the	edge	and	look	down	two	hundred	feet.	The	last	of	Sharon’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">club	 is	 loading	 into	 the	 back	 of	 a	 huge	 moving	 truck.	 Sharon	 walks	 up	 to	 the driver.	I	can’t	see	his	face,	but	he’s	clearly	pissing	her	off.	Her	arms	swing	wildly as	 she	 screams.	 But	 the	 guy’s	 not	 budging,	 and	 Sharon	 looks	 up	 at	 us.	 I	 can barely	hear	her	saying,	“Fucking	move!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Come	on,	we	have	to	go,	Danny.	Can	you	do	this? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	nods	and	gets	down	on	his	knees.	He	grips	the	rungs.	Little	by	little</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	crawls	backwards,	down	over	the	edge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	 is	 telling	 him	 to	 be	 careful.	 He’s	 almost	 vertical	 when	 he	 just	 stops. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara’s	eyes	pop. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">What’s	wrong? </i>	she	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	must	think	since	he’s	outside	now,	hanging	off	the	edge,	that	he	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">talk	as	loud	as	he	wants.	“I	found	your	gun,	Joe!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Danny,	be	quiet. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny’s	face	turns	red.	I	silently	ask	him	where	it	is	and	Danny’s	head	jerks</p>
<p class="calibre1">towards	my	left.	I	fear	he’s	going	to	fling	himself	right	off	the	ladder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	there	it	is,	up	against	the	rock	wall	of	the	tunnel. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p181"></a>American	metal.	Dad’s	gift. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	walk	over	and	pick	it	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Boots	are	getting	closer.	We	all	hear	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Danny,	you	have	to	hurry, </i>	Sara	thinks.  <i class="calibre4">But	be	careful! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	keeps	climbing	down	and	I	tell	Becky	to	go	next.	I	don’t	know	why</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	think	she’s	going	to	have	a	problem	with	this	after	she	jumped	out	her	window, but	it’s	a	short	fear.	She	drops	to	her	knees	and	descends	like	she’s	been	living	in a	circus.	She	even	has	to	slow	down	to	keep	from	stepping	on	Danny’s	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	and	I	lean	over	and	watch	them	like	two	proud,	nervous	parents.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">reality	comes	screeching	back	when	I	see	the	flashlights. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Sara,	you	need	to	go.	Now! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	 struggles	 more	 than	 Danny	 or	 Becky,	 but	 soon	 she’s	 over	 the	 edge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve	 got	 the	 shotgun	 aimed	 down	 the	 tunnel.	 I	 give	 a	 quick	 look	 back	 over	 my shoulder	and	see	Sara	staring	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Joe,	come	on! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I’ll	catch	up.	Don’t	worry.	Keep	going. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 finger’s	 tight	 against	 the	 trigger,	 and	 it	 feels	 good.	 It’s	 not	 just	 a	 gun anymore.	It’s	our	savior	and	protector,	and	it’s	going	to	make	sure	Sara,	Danny, and	Becky	make	it	to	the	truck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 hardly	 know	 Becky,	 but	 I’m	 glad	 she	 made	 it.	 I	 only	 wish	 I	 could’ve brought	more.	It	feels	wrong	to	leave	so	many	behind,	but	there’s	nothing	I	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 slide	 over	 to	 the	 rock	 wall	 and	 lean	 against	 it,	 try	 to	 stay	 out	 of	 the moonlight.	 I	 don’t	 want	 the	 Boots	 to	 see	 me	 and	 duck	 back,	 turning	 this	 into some	prolonged	gunfight.	I’m	too	tired	and	sore,	and	I	don’t	have	enough	ammo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	 hundred	 feet	 down,	 that’s	 all	 that	 stands	 between	 me	 and	 home, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wherever	that	might	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Boots	are	arguing	with	each	other.	They’re	telling	one	to	shut	up.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1">must	see	the	ladder,	because	they’ve	stopped	moving.	The	flashlight	clicks	off.	I was	 hoping	 they’d	 keep	 it	 on	 to	 let	 me	 know	 where	 to	 shoot,	 but	 it	 probably would’ve	blinded	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	eye	closed.	Shoulders	relaxed.	Barrel	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Boots	are	trying	to	tread	lightly,	just	like	I	told	Becky,	but	those	hard</p>
<p class="calibre1">heels	can’t	be	silenced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	clear	out	my	thoughts,	focus	on	the	sounds.	There’s	at	least	three,	maybe</p>
<p class="calibre1">four.	I	assumed	there’d	be	a	lot	more,	but	I	bet	half	of	them	took	the	other	path when	 the	 tunnel	 split.	 I	 just	 wish	 I	 could	 tell	 if	 they	 are	 walking	 single	 file	 or side	by	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	hand	slips	into	my	pocket.	I’ve	got	four	more	shells.	The	only	problem</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p182"></a>is	there	isn’t	any	cover,	so	the	first	round	can’t	miss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inhale	slowly.	Exhale	slowly.	Inhale	and...hold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	first	Boot	comes	out.	He’s	not	even	looking	at	me,	just	marveling	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">stars.	I	wait	an	extra	second	to	see	if	another	one	is	going	to	follow.	Sure	enough, one	Boot	does.	They’re	standing	so	close	I’ll	hit	them	both	even	if	I	only	aim	at one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	crack	off	the	shot	and	the	kickback	slams	me	into	the	wall.	It	fucking	kills. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	should’ve	given	myself	space,	but	at	least	both	Boots	are	on	the	ground.	One’s dead,	and	the	other’s	well	on	his	way.	I	click	open	the	barrel	and	load	two	more shells	when	a	bullet	rips	into	the	rock	by	my	head.	Little	jagged	shards	cut	into my	 neck.	 My	 eyes	 are	 closed	 when	 I	 start	 to	 take	 aim	 at	 the	 third	 Boot,	 but they’re	wide	open	by	the	time	I	get	the	gun	parallel	to	the	ground.	The	next	shot tears	right	through	his	neck.	It	looks	like	his	whole	head	might	come	clean	off, but	it	stays	intact	as	he	falls	onto	his	dead	partners. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	load	another	round	and	try	to	be	as	quiet	as	possible.	I	don’t	hear	any	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">bootsteps.	I	don’t	hear	breathing	or	even	someone	cocking	the	hammer.	It’s	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 take	 a	 quick	 look	 back	 over	 the	 edge,	 see	 everyone	 waiting	 inside	 the truck.	I	know	they	aren’t	going	to	wait	much	longer	so	I	get	down	on	my	knees</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 crawl	 towards	 the	 ladder.	 I	 keep	 the	 shotgun	 aimed	 for	 another	 twenty seconds	or	so,	just	in	case	the	last	Boot	has	more	patience	than	the	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	there’s	not	a	sound.	I	need	to	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 slide	 the	 shotgun	 down	 my	 back,	 inside	 my	 coat,	 and	 I	 use	 one	 hand	 to shove	it	in	the	back	of	my	pants	and	into	the	crack	of	my	ass.	The	rungs	are	cold on	my	fingers.	I	start	to	back	up.	The	rungs	are	getting	slippery,	but	I	know	it’s just	my	sweat.	My	heart	is	thumping	in	my	chest.	I	realize	that	in	the	last	hour I’ve	 stood	 on	 a	 high	 rooftop	 and	 jumped	 out	 a	 window,	 but	 there’s	 just something	 about	 facing	 the	 fall	 backwards	 that	 throws	 my	 guts	 up	 towards	 my throat.	I	keep	telling	myself	just	don’t	look	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 ankle	 throbs,	 but	 I	 keep	 moving.	 I’m	 almost	 halfway	 down	 when	 the rock	next	to	my	face	explodes,	spraying	bits	into	my	eyes	and	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	bullet.	But	not	from	above.	It	came	from	somewhere	off	to	the	left</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	distance.	My	cheeks	and	eyelids	feel	like	I	just	dove	into	a	pool	of	needles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	grip	the	rung	with	my	right	hand,	while	my	left	wipes	away	the	little	shards	in the	corner	of	my	eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hear	Sara	and	Danny	screaming	from	below,	but	I	still	can’t	look	down.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">turn	left	and	see	this	twenty-something	Ranger	posted	up	on	the	hill,	the	muzzle of	 his	 rifle	 aimed	 right	 at	 me.	 Palmer,	 the	 dickhead	 Boot,	 gets	 out	 of	 his	 car, stands	beside	him,	hands	behind	his	back	like	he’s	watching	a	tennis	match. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p183"></a>Melvin	 fires	 his	 revolver,	 which	 has	 no	 chance	 of	 doing	 anything	 except add	to	the	noise,	because	he’s	too	far	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Danny	screams	for	me	to	hurry	and	I’m	trying,	but	my	ankle	keeps	giving</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	and	I	can	only	come	down	with	my	right	foot.	I’m	halfway	down.	A	hundred</p>
<p class="calibre1">feet	from	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 next	 crack	 of	 the	 rifle	 is	 almost	 as	 loud	 as	 the	 crunching	 sound	 the bullet	makes	as	it	blasts	through	my	clavicle.	My	left	hand	just	flies	off	the	rung so	now	I’m	holding	on	with	only	my	right.	I	finally	look	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Fuck	me... </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	force	myself	to	look	up,	which	isn’t	any	better.	The	Ranger	takes	aim,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">barrel	of	that	rifle	pointed	right	at	my	skull.	If	I	don’t	move,	I	won’t	even	hear the	crack.	My	brains	and	blood	will	just	rain	down	on	Sharon’s	chosen	few. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	try	to	swing	my	left	arm	up	to	a	rung	to	give	me	some	stability,	but	all	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">feel	is	red-hot	pain	searing	through	my	shoulder.	I	can’t	even	squeeze	a	fist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Palmer	smiles	and	cocks	his	finger	at	me.	The	Ranger	fires	off	a	shot	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">curl	my	body	back	under	the	ladder.	The	bullet	zips	by	my	neck	as	I	slam	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	rock.	The	ladder	is	all	twisted	now	and	I	try	to	flip	it	back	before	the	Ranger reloads,	but	my	right	hand	slips.	I	don’t	know	how	many	rungs	I	try	to	grab	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 way	 down	 before	 I	 finally	 get	 one,	 my	 legs	 wrapping	 around	 the	 ladder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything’s	tangled	and	the	shotgun	falls	and	cracks	against	the	rocks	below.	I force	 myself	 to	 look.	 Need	 to	 know	 exactly	 how	 far	 I	 have	 to	 fall.	 It’s	 at	 least another	fifty	feet.	I	have	to	drop	if	he	fires	again,	even	if	I	shatter	my	legs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 look	 out	 and	 see	 the	 Ranger	 and	 Palmer	 enjoying	 themselves.	 But	 I’m enjoying	something,	too.	Melvin	has	moved	into	position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	don’t	see	him.	The	Ranger	reloads.	Palmer	gives	him	the	signal.	I	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 left	 leg	 is	 over	 the	 rung,	 meaning	 even	 if	 I	 let	 go,	 I’m	 just	 going	 to	 flip upside	down.	I	try	to	pull	out	my	leg,	but	it’s	impossible	with	only	one	hand.	My left	is	just	hanging	at	my	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	shot	fired.	Then	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	squeeze	my	eyes,	wait	for	death,	but	it	never	comes.	I	finally	peek	and	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">Palmer	and	his	Ranger	both	slumped	over,	both	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sheriff	Melvin	is	making	his	way	back	towards	the	truck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 right	 hand	 is	 starting	 to	 lose	 its	 grip,	 but	 my	 left	 leg	 is	 still	 over	 the rung.	 I	 pull	 up	 with	 everything	 I’ve	 got	 and	 jerk	 my	 leg	 up	 and	 free	 myself.	 I take	a	second	to	catch	my	breath.	It’s	just	fifty	feet.	I	can	do	this.	It’s	slow	and painful,	but	I’m	coming	down	rung	by	rung.	Only	twenty	feet	to	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	take	a	small	break,	look	out	at	Danny	and	Sara,	expecting	to	see	smiles	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	running	towards	me,	but	everyone	is	just	staring	up.	It’s	not	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Six	 Boots	 all	 poised	 at	 the	 edge	 of	 the	 mineshaft.	 Each	 one	 armed	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p184"></a>pointing	 at	 a	 different	 target.	 Sheriff	 Melvin	 is	 running,	 but	 he’s	 still	 too	 far away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	just	start	to	laugh.	Why	I	thought	the	worst	was	over,	I	haven’t	a	clue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fucking	do	it!”	I	yell.	“Just	fucking	shoot	me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	comes	a	low	rumble.	A	stampede	of	a	hundred	feet	mixed	with	wild</p>
<p class="calibre1">howls.	It	just	keeps	getting	louder	and	louder	until	the	entire	night	is	filled	with this	primal	roar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Boots	come	flying	off	the	ledge.	Arms	and	legs	flail	against	the	laws	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">nature.	They	pass	me	one	by	one,	each	smacking	like	slabs	of	meat	on	the	rocks</p>
<p class="calibre1">below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 look	 out	 at	 Danny	 and	 Sara.	 I’ve	 never	 seen	 them	 so	 happy.	 Then	 the ladder	starts	to	shake	and	I	look	up,	see	a	pair	of	feet	coming	down.	I	lean	out and	see	more	feet	following. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brightsiders	climbing	down	from	hell	above. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	have	no	choice	but	to	get	moving.	I	drop	two	rungs	at	a	time,	knowing	if	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t	I’m	going	to	get	kicked	off	because	they’re	all	coming.	I	drop	the	last	few feet	and	rip	more	tendons	in	my	ankle,	but	Danny	and	Sara	are	there	to	help	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	truck.	Sharon’s	yelling	at	the	driver	to	go,	but	he	gets	out	and	runs	over	to us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	finally	see	his	face,	and	I	can’t	decide	whether	to	hug	him	or	punch	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiles	and	thinks,  <i class="calibre4">We’ll	have	time	for	both,	Joe. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad	tells	Danny	to	grab	my	legs.	“Come	on,	we	have	to	get	him	in.”	They</p>
<p class="calibre1">fling	me	into	the	back	of	the	truck,	crammed	in	with	the	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brightsiders	run	for	the	truck,	but	the	roll-up	door	clangs	down.	They	bang</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 back	 and	 beg	 to	 be	 let	 in,	 but	 their	 cries	 fade	 as	 we	 pull	 away.	 Their chances	aren’t	good	on	foot,	but	they	have	ten	hours	of	darkness.	If	they	split	up and	hide,	some	should	slip	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	 eases	 me	 into	 her	 arms,	 careful	 of	 my	 shoulder.	 She	 kisses	 my	 head and	tells	me	not	to	close	my	eyes,	that	I	have	to	stay	awake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	think	about	the	ones	we	left	behind,	lost	and	wandering	this	desert	valley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	are	probably	cursing	us,	but	as	I	look	around,	I	know	we	couldn’t	have	fit</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	than	one	or	two.	The	others	would	have	flipped	the	truck,	torn	us	to	shreds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pray	they	see	the	sunrise,	that	they	live	long	enough	to	tell	the	tale	to	their grandkids.	I	pray	the	Brightsiders	that	stayed	behind	aren’t	punished	for	our	sins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hear	my	prayers	echoing	in	the	minds	of	everyone	around	me.	We’re	the	lucky</p>
<p class="calibre1">ones.	Sharon’s	special	club. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	realize	it’s	my	club	too	as	Becky	slides	her	foot	against	mine	and	Sara</p>
<p class="calibre1">pulls	me	into	her	arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	whispers,	“You	did	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p185"></a>I	 nod	 and	 try	 to	 tell	 myself	 she’s	 right,	 but	 I	 can’t	 stop	 thinking	 about Rachel	and	Wendell	and	Krystal	and... </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shh,”	Sara	says.	She’s	pointing	at	Danny,	sitting	by	the	door,	eyes	closed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">humming	along	to	the	sound	of	the	tires.	He’s	not	thinking	about	anything,	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">humming.	His	mind	as	tranquil	as	the	farthest	reaches	of	space. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	don’t	even	realize	I’m	laughing,	but	I	can’t	stop.	My	head	flops	back	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	has	to	move	out	of	the	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	others	stare	at	me	like	I’ve	lost	my	mind.	Maybe	I	have,	I	don’t	know, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	I’m	not	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara’s	 chest	 is	 shaking	 into	 my	 back.	 She’s	 trying	 to	 control	 it,	 but	 I	 hear her	giggle.	It	spreads	around	the	truck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Becky	starts	to	ask	what’s	so	funny,	but	it	takes	her	too.	She	covers	her	face</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 throws	 her	 head	 into	 Danny’s	 arm.	 He	 snorts	 and	 what	 started	 as	 a	 little stream	is	now	a	raging	river.	All	of	us	doubled-over,	wiping	our	tears.	Cackling like	 maniacs.	 And	 no	 one	 has	 any	 idea	 why.	 All	 we	 know	 is	 that	 right	 now there’s	not	one	single	thought	in	this	truck. </p>
