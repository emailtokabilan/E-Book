<p class="calibre1"><a id="p6"></a><b class="calibre3">1</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I t	was	a	brisk	March	morning	as	I	walked	away	from	the	cove	toward	Main</p>
<p class="calibre1">Street	in	St.	Marin’s,	Maryland.	In	the	shadow	of	the	buildings,	I	was	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">beginning	 to	 see	 the	 tops	 of	 daffodils	 poking	 up	 their	 heads,	 but	 today,	 I tugged	the	hood	of	my	long	sweater	up	higher	on	my	head	and	pulled	the	collar</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 my	 peacoat	 closed.	 Short	 hair	 was	 perfect	 for	 the	 warmer	 days	 –	 and	 for owning	 my	 ever-graying	 locks	 –	 but	 in	 these	 cold	 months,	 I	 sometimes	 missed my	long	ponytail.	Spring	was	coming,	but	it	didn’t	feel	much	like	it	today.	We’d had	 ice	 overnight,	 and	 while	 the	 temperature	 had	 gone	 above	 freezing	 already, the	roads	were	still	wet	and	ice	clung	to	the	edge	of	puddles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still,	 I	 practically	 skipped	 down	 the	 sidewalk,	 even	 though	 skipping	 isn’t always	that	flattering	on	a	slightly	plump	forty-four-year-old.	I	didn’t	care.	This was	going	to	be	the	first	weekend	my	new	bookstore	was	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	slid	my	key	into	the	lock	on	the	front	door	of	the	old	gas	station	and	put	a little	muscle	into	turning	it	in	the	glass-fronted	door.	As	I	swung	it	open,	I	took	a minute	 to	 enjoy	 the	 little	 bell	 above	 my	 head	 as	 it	 chimed.	 That	 bell	 had	 been hanging	 over	 that	 door	 as	 long	 as	 anyone	 in	 town	 could	 remember,	 so	 every long-time	 resident	 of	 St.	 Marin’s	 told	 me	 when	 they	 stopped	 by	 to	 say	 hi	 and take	a	gander	at	the	newest	shop	in	their	–	I	mean,  <i class="calibre4">our</i>	quaint	town.	I	loved	that bell,	 not	 just	 because	 it	 was	 part	 of	 the	 charm	 of	 this	 building,	 but	 because	 I looked	forward	to	hearing	it	when	it	meant	people	were	visiting	 <i class="calibre4">my</i>	bookshop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 had	 just	 come	 back	 to	 St.	 Marin’s	 the	 previous	 October.	 I	 visited	 when	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>was	a	kid	on	a	summer	trip	from	our	family	home	over	near	Baltimore,	and	I’d never	forgotten	the	charm	and	friendliness	of	this	waterside	community. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 hadn’t	 had	 much	 time	 to	 socialize	 since	 coming	 back	 though.	 I’d	 hit	 the ground	running	because	I	wanted	the	shop	open	as	soon	as	possible.	I	needed	the income	 to	 help	 build	 my	 book	 inventory,	 but	 also	 to	 be	 able	 to	 help	 pay	 the mortgage.	My	best	friend	Mart	–	an	expert	on	wineries	–	was	helping	cover	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bills	 for	 our	 house	 since	 she	 had	 a	 good	 paying	 job	 at	 a	 local	 up-and-coming winery	 nearby	 and	 was	 consulting	 all	 over	 the	 East	 Coast.	 I	 felt	 kind	 of	 bad living	 off	 of	 Mart’s	 generosity,	 especially	 since	 she	 had	 basically	 followed	 me here	 from	 the	 West	 Coast	 when	 I’d	 decided	 to	 live	 my	 dreams	 and	 open	 a bookstore	 back	 here	 on	 the	 Eastern	 Shore	 of	 Maryland,	 but	 I	 knew	 that	 Mart didn’t	mind	and	that	I’d	pay	my	friend	back	in	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today,	though,	I	needed	to	finish	painting	the	brick	walls	at	the	front	of	the store.	 I	 loved	 the	 charm	 of	 the	 old	 red	 bricks	 that	 I	 figured	 had	 probably	 been made	nearby,	but	years	of	smokers	and	exhaust	had	made	them	dingy	and	smelly</p>
<p class="calibre1">.	.	.	so	a	good	whitewashing	helped	spiff	them	up	and	made	the	shop	look	cozy</p>
<p class="calibre1">instead	of	dirty.	I	wanted	the	place	to	recall	the	old	gas	station	that	it	originally was,	just	not	too	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 had	 to	 get	 the	 window	 displays	 ready,	 too.	 In	 the	 north	 window	 that	 had once	been	the	station	office,	I	was	putting	up	a	collection	of	books	about	Harriet Tubman,	 the	 woman	 St.	 Marin’s	 was	 honoring	 this	 weekend	 in	 their	 annual Harriet	Tubman	Festival.	Tubman	had	been	enslaved	just	down	the	road	a	piece, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	this	annual	festival	honored	her	memory	and	her	work	on	the	Underground</p>
<p class="calibre1">Railroad	 while	 also	 trying	 to	 educate	 people	 about	 the	 history	 and	 continuing legacy	of	slavery.	Local	historians	and	genealogists	were	going	to	be	giving	talks all	 over	 town,	 and	 I	 was	 hoping	 that	 Catherine	 Clinton,	 the	 woman	 who	 wrote my	favorite	book	on	Tubman,	might	come	by	and	sign	the	copies	of	her	book	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	shop	since	she	was	in	town	for	a	presentation	at	the	local	library. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	other	window,	which	had	opened	onto	the	actual	garage	section	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">gas	station,	I	wanted	to	put	out	some	of	my	favorite	gardening	books,	including titles	that	ranged	from	how	to	build	and	maintain	a	raised-bed	vegetable	garden to	 how	 to	 start	 a	 cut	 flower	 business.	 I’d	 asked	 around	 about	 what	 kind	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>gardeners	were	in	the	community	and	quickly	found	out	that	St.	Mariners	were passionate	 about	 their	 plants.	 I	 took	 that	 intel	 to	 heart	 and	 stocked	 books	 in	 a sizable	 garden	 section	 near	 the	 rear	 of	 the	 store,	 where	 I	 had	 also	 placed	 a wingback	 chair	 upholstered	 in	 floral	 fabric,	 one	 of	 my	 favorite	 antique	 store finds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 rest	 of	 the	 store	 was	 equally	 cozy	 with	 big	 armchairs,	 lots	 of	 tables where	 readers	 could	 set	 a	 mug	 of	 something	 warm,	 and	 dog	 beds	 positioned strategically	 to	 accommodate	 any	 pup,	 but	 especially	 Mayhem,	 my	 new	 rescue puppy.	 Mayhem	 had	 been	 named	 Maxine	 at	 the	 shelter,	 and	 I	 had	 picked	 her because	 she	 was	 –	 it	 seemed	 –	 the	 calmest	 in	 the	 litter.	 As	 soon	 as	 I	 got	 her home,	though,	the	little	gal	had	started	chewing	anything	wooden	that	she	could find	–	a	beautiful	piece	of	driftwood	I	had	picked	up	on	Bodega	Beach,	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	wine	barrel	staves	that	Mart	had	brought	home	to	use	for	a	sign	by	our	house, even	 the	 table	 leg	 of	 the	 farm	 table	 we	 had	 purchased	 at	 a	 yard	 sale	 back	 in November.	 Plus,	 Aslan,	 my	 cat,	 took	 immediately	 to	 hiding	 under	 my	 bed anytime	 the	 puppy	 was	 nearby	 because	 the	 dog	 desperately	 wanted	 to	 be	 her friend.	I	had	started	calling	her	Mayhem	as	a	joke,	and	the	name	stuck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortunately,	 the	 Black	 Mouth	 Cur	 –	 a	 friend	 on	 Facebook	 had	 told	 me	 that was	Mayhem’s	breed	after	seeing	a	picture	–	had	no	affinity	for	chewing	books. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 was	 already	 a	 fixture	 at	 the	 shop,	 often	 taking	 up	 residence	 in	 a	 sunbeam coming	through	the	north	window	while	I	worked.	If	nothing	else,	her	presence</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 sure	 to	 bring	 business	 if	 the	 number	 of	 people	 who	 stopped	 to	 talk	 to	 her through	the	glass	was	an	indication. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today,	I	had	left	her	home	to	rest	up.	I	hoped	tomorrow’s	shop	traffic	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	heavy,	and	Mayhem	insisted	on	greeting	everyone	who	came	in.	The	puppy</p>
<p class="calibre1">needed	to	conserve	her	energy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once,	on	a	trip	to	visit	a	friend	in	Denver,	I	had	visited	a	bookstore	in	Frisco, Colorado,	and	had	loved	that	the	owner’s	Bernese	Mountain	Dog	had	free	rein	of the	 shop.	 I	 had	 vowed	 then	 and	 there	 that	 I’d	 have	 an	 open	 door	 policy	 for pooches	if	I	ever	was	able	to	fulfill	my	dream	of	owning	my	own	bookstore. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">My	 own	 bookstore. </i> I	 stopped	 mid-paint	 stroke	 and	 let	 out	 a	 long	 heavy breath.	 I’d	 done	 it.	 I’d	 finally	 done	 it.	 Tomorrow,	 I	 was	 opening	 my	 own</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>bookstore.	I	shivered	a	little	with	excitement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 bell	 rang	 over	 the	 door,	 and	 in	 came	 Woody	 Isherwood,	 the	 town woodworker.	 Woody	 was	 a	 white	 man	 about	 seventy,	 short	 and	 stout	 like	 a teapot,	and	I	imagined	he	had	been	able	to	lift	most	anything	back	in	the	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	come	to	know	him	when	Mayhem	had	gotten	her	teeth	into	an	antique</p>
<p class="calibre1">table	at	one	of	the	local	store’s	sidewalk	sales	and	I	had	needed	to	buy	the	table and	 then	 have	 it	 repaired.	 Woody	 had	 done	 a	 splendid	 job	 of	 turning	 the	 small console	table	into	a	cute	little	stool	that	was	perfect	for	that	garden	section	wing chair.	 So,	 when	 I	 decided	 I	 wanted	 a	 wood-burned	 sign	 for	 the	 shop,	 I’d contacted	Woody	first	thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,	 here	 he	 was,	 ready	 to	 hang	 his	 creation.	 The	 sign	 was	 made	 from several	 planks	 of	 reclaimed	 wood	 that	 Woody	 got	 from	 an	 old	 tobacco	 barn down	the	road,	and	the	shop	name	–	All	Booked	Up	–	was	burned	deep	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">gray	wood.	It	was	the	perfect	blend	of	rustic	and	nautical,	and	I	thought	it	was one	of	the	most	beautiful	things	I’d	ever	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Woody,	thank	you	so	much.	I	can’t	wait	to	see	it	up	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 most	 welcome,	 Harvey.	 But	 before	 I	 hang	 it,	 I	 have	 a	 question	 for you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure.”	I	sat	down	on	the	edge	of	the	platform	I’d	built	by	the	south	window</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	future	readings	by	local	and	visiting	authors.	“What’s	your	question?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Woody	looked	a	little	sheepish	behind	his	silver	beard,	but	he	looked	me	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	eye	and	said,	“Your	given	name	Harvey?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled.	I	got	this	question	a	lot,	especially	from	the	old-timers	over	here	in the	rural	Eastern	Shore.	One	old	fellow	had	even	gone	so	far	as	to	say,	“That’s	a man’s	name.	Your	folks	must’ve	wanted	a	boy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 name	 is	 Anastasia	 Lovejoy	 Beckett.	 At	 least	 that’s	 what	 my	 birth certificate	 says,	 but	 I	 never	 felt	 much	 like	 an	 Anastasia,	 and	 Lovejoy	 is	 what everyone	 called	 my	 granny.	 So	 somewhere	 along	 the	 way,	 my	 dad	 just	 started calling	me	Harvey,	and	it	stuck.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Woody	 grinned.	 “I	 could	 call	 you	 Stacy	 if	 you’d	 like	 to	 go	 back	 to	 your roots.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	thank	you,”	I	nearly	shouted.	“Harvey	is	just	fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>Woody	laughed	and	then	glanced	out	the	window.	“Ah,	there’s	my	assistant for	the	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stood	up	and	saw	a	thin,	dark-haired,	white	man	in	coveralls	coming	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">door.	I	ran	a	hand	through	my	short,	graying	hair	and	was	embarrassed	to	find	it coated	in	a	thin	layer	of	paint	splatter.  <i class="calibre4">You	can’t	take	me	anywhere</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 door	 chimed,	 and	 the	 man	 walked	 in.	 Woody	 nodded	 at	 the	 man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harvey	 Beckett,	 I	 expect	 you	 know	 Daniel	 Galena	 from	 the	 garage	 up	 the street.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nice	to	meet	you,	Harvey.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	a	step	forward	and	used	the	second	to	catch	my	breath.	This	man	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">super	handsome	in	a	down-home	kind	of	way,	and	he	had	a	dimple	in	his	right</p>
<p class="calibre1">cheek.	 I	 never	 had	 been	 able	 to	 resist	 a	 dimple.	 “Ah,	 you’re	 the	 infamous	 St. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marin’s	mechanic.”	I	put	out	my	hand.	“Nice	to	meet	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	smile	grew.	“And	you’re	the	brave	woman	who	has	decided	our	decrepit</p>
<p class="calibre1">gas	station	needs	new	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	felt	the	color	rise	to	my	cheeks.	“It’s	a	beautiful	building.	I’m	honored	to fill	it	again.	Do	you	read?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	time,	Daniel	blushed.	“Oh	no,	ma’am.	I	mean	I	love	books,	but	I’m	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	of	a	reader	myself.	More	hands-on.”	He	held	his	hands	out	in	front	of	him, and	I	noticed	that	they	were	calloused	and	a	bit	dirty.	It	was	endearing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	 well,	 we’re	 not	 all	 book	 people	 in	 this	 world.	 For	 my	 part,	 I	 have trouble	finding	the	thingy	that	releases	my	hood,	and	the	best	description	of	a	car I	can	give	is	its	color.	I	drive	a	blue	car,	for	the	record.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	midnight	blue	2012	Subaru	Outback,”	he	said	without	hesitation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	seen	my	car.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	grinned.	“It’s	a	small	town,	and	I	know	cars.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Woody	 cleared	 his	 throat,	 and	 I	 realized	 that	 I’d	 kind	 of	 been	 flirting.	 The woodsmith	 gave	 me	 a	 wink	 and	 said,	 “You	 ready	 to	 help	 the	 lady	 with	 this sign?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes	 sir.	 Let’s	 get	 this	 up	 so	 that	 it’s	 ready	 for	 grand	 opening.	 Tomorrow, right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep.	 I	 hope	 you’ll	 both	 come.	 We’ll	 have	 food	 and	 The	 Watermen	 –	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>band	not	the	actual	fishermen	–	are	going	to	play.	It’ll	be	a	fun	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Mrs.	and	I	will	be	here.	I	hear	it’s	alright	if	we	bring	along	Missy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course.	Children	are	always	welcome.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Woody	 let	 out	 a	 roar	 of	 a	 laugh.	 “Oh	 Missy’s	 our	 Chesapeake	 Bay</p>
<p class="calibre1">Retriever.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	blushed	and	smiled.	“Well,	still	true.	Definitely	bring	Missy.	Mayhem	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	here.	We’re	a	dog-friendly	shop.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	that	case,”	Daniel	said,	“Maybe	I’ll	bring	Taco.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	felt	my	smile	grow	wider.	“Not	your	son,	I	take	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	Daniel’s	turn	to	laugh.	“I	don’t	have	any	kids,	and	I	certainly	hope	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wouldn’t	name	one	of	them	Taco.	No,	he’s	my	Basset	Hound.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 love	 Basset	 Hounds.”	 As	 if	 this	 guy	 wasn’t	 already	 catching	 my	 eye,	 he was	the	owner	of	one	of	my	favorite	breeds.	I	was	probably	doomed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Woody	opened	the	door,	and	the	bell	rang	again.	“We’ll	get	this	up	in	a	jiffy, Harvey.	See	you	tomorrow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 had	 been	 excited	 before,	 but	 now,	 people	 were	 really	 coming.	 Dogs,	 too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	Daniel,	well,	that	might	just	be	a	little	bonus. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a><b class="calibre3">2</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">W hen	I	woke	at	six,	Mart	was	already	up	and	making	breakfast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	at	this	early	hour	and	after	a	wild	week	at	work,	she	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	she’d	just	stepped	out	of	a	J.	Jill	catalog	with	her	messy	pony</p>
<p class="calibre1">tail	and	rosy	cheeks.	On	some	people,	this	kind	of	natural	beauty	–	dark	hair	not yet	graying	and	clear,	glowing	skin	–	might	make	me	a	little	jealous,	but	on	my best	 friend,	 it	 just	 fit	 the	 kindness	 of	 her	 spirit.	 “You	 can’t	 go	 to	 your	 grand opening	on	an	empty	stomach.	Bacon,	eggs,	and	some	of	those	scones	from	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	patisserie	over	in	Annapolis.	You	sit.	I’ll	bring	it	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wiped	the	sleep	from	my	eyes	and	tried	not	to	trip	over	Mayhem	–	who	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">strategically	positioned	herself	below	the	bacon	pan	–	as	I	made	my	way	to	the table.	I	noted	that	Aslan	had	wisely	found	a	perch	on	top	of	the	bookshelf	in	the dining	room.	She	too	hoped	for	bacon,	but	she	knew	it	best	not	to	try	the	dog’s overzealous	attempts	at	friendship	when	fried	pork	was	involved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 I	 perched	 on	 a	 bar	 stool,	 I	 said,	 “You	 didn’t	 have	 to	 do	 this.	 You’ve already	done	so	much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	please.	It’s	the	grand	opening	of	the	bookstore	that	we’ve	been	working</p>
<p class="calibre1">hard	to	open	for	five	months	now.	It’s	the	least	I	can	do.	You	saved	me	from	the uppity	world	of	northern	California	wineries	and	brought	me	to	this	place	where the	 very	 little	 bit	 I	 know	 about	 wine	 seems	 like	 I	 invented	 the	 stuff.	 I’m	 a valuable	 commodity	 over	 here,	 and	 I	 like	 it.”	 She	 tossed	 her	 hair	 like	 she	 was walking	the	runway	and	returned	to	the	stovetop. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>Mart	 was	 trying	 to	 make	 light	 of	 the	 notoriety	 she’d	 already	 gained	 as	 an expert	in	wine	operations.	She	was	the	head	of	marketing	at	the	local	winery,	but as	soon	as	she’d	arrived,	other	wineries	had	asked	for	her	help	in	promoting	their places.	Fortunately,	she	was	able	to	do	both	because	she	loved	the	local	spot	but also	thrived	on	the	travel	and	time	with	people.	She	was	every	bit	the	extrovert to	my	introvert	self. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 weekend,	 she’d	 turned	 down	 a	 really	 impressive	 –	 and	 well-paying opportunity	 –	 near	 Charlottesville,	 Virginia	 to	 consult	 with	 a	 celebrity	 winery owner	 just	 so	 she	 could	 be	 here	 for	 my	 grand	 opening.	 I	 was	 very	 grateful because	I	wasn’t	sure	I	could	do	this	without	her,	but	I	still	felt	a	little	guilty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	set	a	huge	plate	of	food	in	front	of	me	and	then	placed	a	small	saucer	of eggs	 up	 on	 the	 bookshelf	 for	 Aslan.	 My	 best	 friend	 had	 been	 totally	 suckered into	believing	that	poor	cat	was	suffering,	and	that	chubby	feline	was	not	going to	dissuade	her	of	that	delusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 looked	 down	 at	 Mayhem.	 She	 was	 sitting	 up,	 head	 on	 my	 thigh,	 hopeful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	knew	the	bacon	was	an	unlikely	treat,	but	maybe	some	of	those	eggs	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	their	way	to	her	waiting	mouth.	I	gave	her	a	scratch	and	then	tucked	into the	food. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	seven,	Mayhem,	Mart,	and	I	were	walking	up	to	the	shop.	Woody’s	sign</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	 great,	 the	 strings	 of	 Edison	 bulbs	 that	 I’d	 splurged	 on	 were	 giving	 the front	windows	a	warm	glow,	and	the	bright	pink	Grand	Opening	banner	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">awning	 at	 the	 front	 of	 the	 store	 was	 shining	 bright	 in	 the	 glow	 of	 the	 morning moonlight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	a	lot	riding	on	today	in	terms	of	money,	but	also	reputation.	If	the	store didn’t	 get	 a	 good	 start,	 it	 would	 be	 hard	 for	 me	 to	 gain	 enough	 momentum	 to stay	 up,	 much	 less	 grow.	 So	 I’d	 gone	 all	 in.	 I’d	 taken	 out	 ads	 in	 the	 local newspaper,	 posted	 to	 Facebook	 in	 every	 book-related	 group	 in	 the	 area,	 and pushed	out	a	huge	press	release	about	the	grand	opening.	The	local	paper,	the	 <i class="calibre4">St. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Marin’s	 Courier</i>,	 had	 come	 out	 to	 interview	 me	 for	 a	 feature	 piece	 in	 last Sunday’s	edition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 reporter,	 Lucia	 Stevensmith,	 had	 visited	 the	 shop	 last	 Thursday	 for	 an interview,	and	I	had	been	so	excited	that	she	wanted	to	be	in	the	space	and	get	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>feel	 of	 it.	 But	 I	 almost	 immediately	 regretted	 that	 we	 hadn’t	 gone	 down	 to	 the waterfront	 or	 something.	 The	 look	 on	 her	 face	 when	 she	 walked	 in	 wasn’t	 a welcome,	excited	one.	She	looked	like	she’d	just	tasted	a	raw	persimmon	for	the first	 time.	 Her	 thin	 face	 was	 puckered,	 and	 beneath	 her	 graying	 eyebrows,	 her eyes	were	tiny	with	what	I	thought	was	disgust.	“Oh,	I	see	you	haven’t	gone	for a	full	remodel,”	was	the	first	thing	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	 she	 was	 bossy	 to	 the	 extreme	 and	 gave	 me	 advice	 about	 how	 to organize	the	shelves,	suggested	I	move	the	location	of	the	register	closer	to	the door	 for	 “loss	 prevention”	 –	 it	 took	 me	 forever	 to	 figure	 out	 she	 meant shoplifting	–	and	tried	to	persuade	me	that	I’d	never	be	successful	with	a	general bookstore.	 “You	 need	 to	 specialize	 in	 something.	 Maybe	 nautical	 books	 or history	about	Maryland.	You’re	just	not	going	to	find	people	who	want	to	read</p>
<p class="calibre1">mystery	novels	AND	buy	nature	guides.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 read	 mystery	 novels	 and	 buy	 nature	 guides.	 I’m	 sure	 I’m	 not	 the	 only one,”	I	had	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	let	a	little	snort	out	and	continued	her	critique	as	she	moved	into	our small	café.	Apparently,	I	would	“lose	my	shirt”	with	food.	“Total	money	pit.”	I had	found	it	hard	not	to	either	defend	myself	or	cry,	but	I	silently	bore	up	under her	barrage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	Mart	had	put	a	stop	to	her	bevy	of	“suggestions”	by	saying	that	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	prepared	cappuccinos	for	us.	“Is	it	decaf?	I	don’t	touch	anything	but	decaf after	ten	a.m.	I	have	a	sensitive	system,”	she’d	said.	Mart	told	her	that	it	was	not decaf,	and	I	 was	pretty	sure	 Stevensmith	whispered	the	 word	“heathens”	under her	breath,	but	decided	to	let	it	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 interview	 itself	 was	 pretty	 straightforward,	 and	 I	 was	 grateful	 for	 the chance	to	talk	about	my	hopes	for	the	shop	–	that	people	would	make	it	a	place they	gathered,	that	they’d	suggest	titles	I	should	carry	and	authors	they’d	like	to see	read	here,	and	that	All	Booked	Up	would	become	a	part	of	St.	Marin’s,	just like	the	other	wonderful	shops	on	Main	Street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stevensmith	had	said,	“How	quaint”	with	a	certain	dismissive	tone	and	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">snapped	a	few	pictures	with	her	phone	before	heading	out.	Fortunately,	the	paper had	sent	over	a	photographer	the	next	day,	and	they	had	done	a	nice	piece	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a><img src="index-15_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">few	 great	 photos	 and	 key	 quotes	 in	 the	 Sunday	 edition.	 Most	 of	 Stevensmith’s persnicketiness	had	gotten	edited	out,	thank	goodness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 I’d	 asked	 Woody	 about	 the	 reporter,	 he’d	 rolled	 his	 eyes.	 “That woman	rubs	every	single	human	on	the	earth	the	wrong	way.	She	always	has	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">opinion	about	everything,	and	is	never	afraid	to	share	it.	In	fact,	just	last	week, she	 started	 telling	 Lucas	 –	 the	 director	 of	 the	 maritime	 museum	 –	 that	 she thought	they	should	get	rid	of	the	exhibition	about	the	enslaved	men	who	fished these	 waters	 and	 ran	 boats	 along	 the	 waterways	 here	 because	 it	 made	 people uncomfortable.”	I	knew	I	liked	Lucas	immediately	when	Woody	said	the	director</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	rolled	his	eyes	and	said,	“That’s	sort	of	the	point,	Lucia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I’m	glad	it’s	not	just	me,	then?”	I	asked	Woody. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope,	 pretty	 much	 nobody	 likes	 the	 woman,	 but	 we	 try	 to	 be	 neighborly, you	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	did	know.	In	small	southern	communities,	neighborliness	was	the	currency</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	which	everyone	survived.	Without	each	other,	no	one	would	make	it.	But	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">course,	 this	 also	 meant	 there	 were	 a	 fair	 number	 of	 crotchety	 folks	 that	 people had	to	put	up	with,	and	apparently,	I’d	met	one.	Lucky	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WHEN	 WE	 ARRIVED	 at	 the	 store,	 I	 unlocked	 the	 shop	 door,	 smiling	 as	 the	 bell rang	above	me,	and	held	it	open	for	Mart	as	she	headed	right	to	the	register	with most	of	my	savings	in	small	bills	to	make	change. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	walked	to	the	back	of	the	store	and	turned	on	a	second	bank	of	lights	by	the art	 and	 gardening	 books.	 I’d	 wait	 a	 bit	 before	 I	 turned	 on	 everything	 since	 I wasn’t	 quite	 ready	 for	 customers	 yet.	 Opening	 time	 for	 this	 first	 day	 was	 eight a.m.	since	I’d	promised	fresh	baked	goods,	hot	coffee,	and	plenty	of	hot	cocoa	in the	 café.	 I	 expected	 my	 only	 employee	 –	 Raquel	 –	 to	 be	 in	 shortly	 to	 staff	 the food	and	beverage	side	of	things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rocky,	 as	 she	 preferred	 to	 be	 called,	 was	 a	 tender	 but	 confident	 young woman	of	about	twenty.	She	took	classes	at	Salisbury,	a	local	university,	but	still lived	 at	 home.	 Each	 time	 I’d	 met	 with	 her	 to	 plan	 the	 café,	 her	 hair	 had	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>done	in	another	stylish	look	–	once	she	had	long	braids,	once	a	wild	pixy	cut	that framed	her	face	and	set	off	her	light-brown	skin	perfectly.	Someday,	I’d	get	up the	nerve	to	get	tips	on	hairstyles	from	her.	But	today,	I	had	just	managed	to	get	a little	pomade	in	to	tame	my	curls	in	the	short	cut	I’ve	gotten	from	the	salon	up the	street.	The	last	thing	I	needed	was	to	worry	about	a	bad	hair	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	 I	 fussed	 with	 the	 books	 a	 bit	 more,	 Mart	 made	 sure	 the	 register	 was stocked	and	the	tablet	that	we’d	use	to	take	credit	cards	was	working.	Then,	she began	 laying	 small	 piles	 of	 postcards	 with	 the	 shop	 hours,	 events,	 and	 contact information	 on	 all	 the	 tables.	 If	 she	 didn’t	 already	 have	 a	 job	 (and	 if	 I	 had	 the money),	I’d	be	looking	to	hire	her	as	my	marketing	advisor.	She	was	 <i class="calibre4">so	good</i>	at this	stuff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bell	chimed,	and	Rocky	came	in	with	her	arms	full	of	what	looked	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">cinnamon	 rolls	 doused	 in	 icing.	 Despite	 my	 full	 breakfast,	 my	 mouth	 started watering.	 “What	 are	 those?”	 Mart	 asked,	 coming	 over	 to	 help	 Rocky	 carry everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 mom	 makes	 the	 best	 cinnamon	 rolls.	 She	 whipped	 up	 a	 batch	 this morning	for	the	grand	opening.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gently	peeled	back	the	plastic	wrap	and	leaned	down	to	take	a	long,	slow</p>
<p class="calibre1">inhale.	“Is	that	maple	icing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure	is.	Mom’s	specialty.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	be	having	one	of	those	later,”	I	said,	“and	maybe	if	we	get	good	traffic today,	 we	 could	 ask	 your	 mom	 if	 she’d	 make	 these	 for	 us	 regularly.”	 This weekend	would	bring	the	biggest	off-seasons	crowds	for	the	Tubman	festival,	so I	sure	hoped	it	meant	we’d	get	some	good	traffic,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	expect	she	could	be	persuaded,”	Rocky	said	as	she	pushed	back	the	stray</p>
<p class="calibre1">strand	 of	 black	 hair	 that	 had	 slipped	 forward	 from	 her	 gorgeous	 halo	 of	 curls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	get	everything	set	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 café	 was	 small,	 just	 three	 or	 four	 tables	 in	 what	 used	 to	 be	 the	 garage bay	of	the	gas	station,	a	counter,	a	baked	goods	case,	and	an	espresso	machine, but	 I	 hoped	 it	 would	 encourage	 customers	 to	 stay	 a	 while.	 St.	 Marin’s	 didn’t have	a	formal	coffee	shop,	so	I	wanted	this	to	be	a	place	people	would	hang	out, do	a	little	work,	maybe	read	a	book	and	make	a	purchase,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a><img src="index-17_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	back	of	the	garage	bay	behind	the	café,	Woody	and	a	friend	had	built	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">wall	 and	 created	 a	 storeroom	 for	 me.	 Right	 now,	 it	 was	 mostly	 empty	 since	 I couldn’t	 afford	 to	 have	 much	 inventory	 that	 wasn’t	 already	 on	 the	 floor,	 but	 I looked	 forward	 to	 seeing	 boxes	 of	 books,	 especially	 for	 author	 events	 and holiday	sales,	filling	the	space. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	a	quick	look	around	the	shop	to	be	sure	everything	was	good	and	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">headed	to	the	back	to	get	a	few	more	of	the	paper	bags	Mart	had	bought	for	the grand	 opening.	 They	 each	 had	 our	 shop	 name	 and	 a	 sketch	 of	 the	 storefront printed	on	them,	and	I	wanted	to	be	certain	Rocky	had	some	for	the	café	in	case anyone	wanted	to	take	a	pastry	for	the	road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stepped	into	the	back	room	and	flipped	on	the	light.	Then,	I	screamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There,	 on	 the	 floor,	 was	 the	 body	 of	 a	 woman.	 She	 was	 sprawled	 out	 like whatever	 had	 killed	 her	 had	 taken	 her	 by	 surprise,	 and	 while	 I	 didn’t	 see	 any blood,	 I	 was	 sure	 she	 was	 dead.	 There’s	 just	 something	 about	 a	 living	 person’s body	 –	 a	 movement	 even	 when	 that	 person	 is	 still	 –	 that	 a	 dead	 body	 doesn’t have.	This	was	my	second	time	finding	someone	dead,	and	I	didn’t	love	that	now I’d	have	two	images	of	lifeless	bodies	haunting	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	 and	 Rocky	 came	 running	 and	 stopped	 short	 as	 soon	 as	 they	 could	 see over	my	shoulders.	“Oh	my	word,”	Rocky	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	a	deep	breath	and	reached	for	my	phone	just	as	Mart	said,	“Isn’t	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	reporter	who	was	here	the	other	day?	The	rude	woman?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	a	few	more	steps,	I	was	at	the	body.	I	leaned	down,	and	sure	enough,	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	Lucia	Stevensmith.	“Maybe	we	shouldn’t	call	her	rude	anymore,”	I	said	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart.	I	was	trying	to	lighten	the	mood,	but	really	I	just	wanted	to	cry.	Someone had	died	in	my	store	on	my	opening	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WITHIN	MINUTES,	Sheriff	Mason	had	arrived	with	a	new	deputy	named	Williams. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 sheriff	 was	 beloved	 in	 St.	 Marin’s	 because	 he	 was	 absolutely	 no-nonsense when	 it	 came	 to	 police	 work,	 but	 also	 super	 funny.	 When	 the	 high	 school football	 team	 had	 won	 the	 State	 Championships	 back	 in	 November,	 the	 sheriff</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>had	organized	the	townspeople	to	line	the	road	into	St.	Marin’s	with	scarecrows holding	each	players’	names,	and	when	they	reached	the	town	square,	there	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	huge	banner	that	said,	“Catamounts	are	no	scaredy	cats”	hanging	in	front	of	a huge,	stuffed	mountain	lion	pinning	down	a	tiny	“rebel”	soldier	that	represented the	 mascot	 of	 the	 team	 they’d	 just	 beaten.	 Mart	 had	 said	 that	 was	 very	 “on brand”	 since	 the	 African	 American	 sheriff	 was	 also	 known	 for	 “having	 a conversation”	 with	 anyone	 who	 thought	 it	 fitting	 to	 hang	 a	 Confederate	 flag	 in his	town.	“Maybe	it	is	heritage,	but	it’s	a	heritage	of	hate,”	he’d	said	in	a	local newspaper.	I	pretty	much	loved	him	for	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 he	 and	 Officer	 Williams,	 a	 petite,	 almost	 tiny,	 black	 woman	 who looked	like	her	utility	belt	might	drag	her	to	the	ground	at	any	moment,	showed up	in	the	back	room	of	my	store,	I	let	out	the	breath	I	hadn’t	even	been	aware	I was	holding.	The	sheriff	took	a	very	close	look	at	Stevensmith’s	body	and	then escorted	 us	 out	 of	 the	 room	 before	 saying,	 “Probably	 not	 the	 opening	 day attention	you	were	hoping	for,	huh,	Harvey?”	He	gave	me	a	wry	grin	and	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">dispatched	Williams	to	call	the	coroner	before	guiding	me	to	the	café	to	get	my statement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	okay?”	he	asked	as	we	sat	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 nodded,	 grateful	 for	 his	 kindness.	 He’d	 been	 by	 a	 few	 times,	 just	 to	 say hello	and	let	us	know	his	staff	was	keeping	an	eye	on	things	as	we	got	the	shop started.	I	had	appreciated	his	attention	and	already	felt	like	he	was	a	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	so	just	tell	me	what	you	know.”	His	voice	was	soft	and	encouraging. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	much	to	tell,”	I	began.	“I	went	in	the	back	room,	and	there	she	was.”	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">told	him	about	my	morning,	about	when	I	arrived,	in	as	much	detail	as	I	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">remember,	hoping	that	something	would	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mason	nodded	and	made	a	few	notes.	Then	he	sat	back,	took	a	long	sip	of	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">cappuccino	with	extra	foam,	and	said,	“One	of	the	things	we’ll	have	to	figure	out is	how	she	got	in.	I	know	there’s	a	back	door	off	the	garage,	I	mean	café,	right?	I expect	you	keep	that	locked.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	“Of	course.”	I	tried	to	remember	closing	up	the	night	before,	but	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	been	so	tired	that	I	only	remembered	getting	home,	eating	cereal	for	dinner, and	collapsing	into	bed.	“But	it’s	been	a	busy	few	days.	Let	me	check.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>I	walked	back	past	the	storeroom,	the	sheriff	close	behind,	to	the	half-glass back	door	that	opened	onto	a	small	parking	lot	and	turned	the	handle.	It	opened right	up.	“Oh	no!	I	must	have	forgotten	to	lock	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sheriff	stepped	around	me	and	looked	closely	at	the	door	jamb.	“Nope, </p>
<p class="calibre1">looks	like	someone	credit	carded	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	actually	a	thing	people	can	do?	I	thought	it	was	just	on	TV	shows.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually	a	thing.	Pretty	easy,	too,	on	a	door	like	this	at	least.”	He	turned	to the	 storeroom	 door.	 “Let	 me	 show	 you.”	 The	 sheriff	 took	 a	 grocery	 store discount	 club	 card	 out	 of	 his	 wallet,	 turned	 the	 simple	 tab	 on	 the	 storeroom doorknob,	and	pulled	the	door	shut.	Then,	he	took	the	card,	slid	it	between	the door	 and	 the	 jamb,	 and	 worked	 it	 down	 until	 he	 was	 at	 the	 latch.	 Then,	 he wiggled	the	card	a	bit,	and	the	door	popped	open.	“See.	Pretty	easy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Glory!	Alright,	I’m	having	a	deadbolt	put	on	that	backdoor	right	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	 plan.	 I’ll	 ask	 Williams	 to	 check	 for	 prints	 –	 not	 that	 it’s	 likely	 we’ll get	much	that’s	usable	–	and	then	you	can	call	your	alarm	company.	I	might	go</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	a	full-on	security	bar	if	I	were	you.	It	would	keep	the	door	locked	but	also let	you	know	if	someone	tried	to	sneak	out	of	the	store	from	the	back.	Should	be easy	to	do	before	the	end	of	the	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks.”	 I	 looked	 at	 my	 watch	 –	 7:45.	 I	 was	 supposed	 to	 open	 in	 fifteen minutes.	I	let	out	a	long	sigh	of	disappointment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mason	 looked	 at	 me	 and	 smiled.	 “Don’t	 worry,	 Harvey.	 It’ll	 only	 take	 the coroner	 a	 minute	 to	 load	 out	 Stevensmith’s	 body,	 and	 then	 no	 one	 will	 be	 the wiser.	 After	 all,	 she	 was	 our	 only	 reporter.	 No	 one	 left	 to	 tell	 the	 story.”	 He winked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	laughed	hesitantly.	“Some	people	might	think	you’re	a	little	flippant	about	a death,	Sheriff.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	frowned.	“Never.	But	then,	it’s	not	going	to	bring	her	back	for	me	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">overly	 serious	 is	 it.”	 A	 smile	 crept	 into	 the	 corner	 of	 his	 mouth.	 “Besides,	 we don’t	want	to	hurt	business	in	our	newest	shop	here	in	town.	I’ll	do	my	best	to keep	this	quiet	until	this	afternoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 thank	 you,	 Sheriff.	 I	 mean,	 I	 don’t	 want	 to	 hinder	 an	 investigation	 or anything,	but	if	there’s	no	harm	in	keeping	things	quiet	.	.	.	“</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>“Actually,	it	might	be	a	help.	As	soon	as	word	gets	out,	everyone	will	have	a theory.	This	will	give	me	a	few	hours	to	get	a	handle	on	things	before	the	entire town	 starts	 in	 on	 my	 cellphone.”	 He	 tapped	 the	 smartphone	 holstered	 opposite his	pistol.	“Now,	how	about	another	of	those	cinnamon	rolls	while	we	wait?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a><b class="calibre3">3</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	time	we	closed	the	shop	at	seven	p.m.	that	first	day,	I	was	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">dazzling	combination	of	exhausted	and	exhilarated	that	had	me	smiling</p>
<p class="calibre1">nonstop,	but	also	very	much	in	need	of	a	comfy	chair	and	an	ottoman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	locked	the	front	door,	and	I	collapsed	in	the	chair-and-a-half	by	the	fiction section,	 curling	 my	 feet	 up	 under	 me	 and	 dropping	 my	 head	 back	 on	 the overstuffed	cushion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 was	 A.MA.ZING.”	 Mart	 said	 as	 she	 slumped	 to	 the	 floor	 against	 the bookshelf	next	to	me.	“There	must	have	been	1,000	people	through	here	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“1,312	to	be	exact.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	were	counting?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 held	 up	 the	 silver	 counter-clicker	 I’d	 picked	 up	 at	 an	 office	 supply	 store when	I’d	visited	Salisbury	last	week.	“I	come	prepared.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Love	it!	So	over	1,300	people.	Wow.	No	wonder	we’re	so	tired.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tired	 doesn’t	 even	 begin	 to	 cover	 it.	 I	 still	 can’t	 believe	 I	 have	 my	 own bookstore.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	only	that,	but	Catherine	Clinton	signed	her	books	AND	agreed	to	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	a	book	event	for	you	in	April.	That’s	huge.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	.	.	.	but	not	as	huge	as	finding	a	dead	body	in	my	back	room.”	I	was	so excited	that	Clinton	was	coming	to	sign,	but	all	day,	I’d	kept	flashing	back	to	the image	 of	 Lucia	 Stevensmith’s	 lifeless	 body.	 It	 had	 been	 a	 great	 grand	 opening day	.	.	.	but	a	tainted	one.	I	hadn’t	liked	the	reporter,	but	I	was	still	sad	that	she</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a><img src="index-22_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">had	died	–	and	horrified	that	someone	had	killed	her,	killed	her	in	my	shop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	sighed.	“Right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	SHERIFF	HAD	COME	by	late	in	the	day	to	say	the	coroner	had	ruled	the	cause of	death	to	be	a	blow	to	the	head	by	something	cylindrical. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 reporter	 in	 the	 storeroom	 with	 a	 candlestick,”	 Sheriff	 Mason	 had	 said with	 a	 terrible	 English	 accent,	 and	 I	 hadn’t	 been	 able	 to	 keep	 from	 laughing.	 I sounded	a	little	 hysterical	to	myself.	 The	fatigue	and	 double-adrenaline	shot	of the	grand	opening	and	the	murder	had	started	to	fray	my	nerves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	there’s	anything	shaped	like	that	in	my	store,”	I	said,	looking around	 and	 finding	 myself	 grateful	 that	 the	 sheriff	 had	 come	 by	 in	 jeans	 and	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meyerhoff’s	Grocery”	T-shirt	instead	of	his	uniform. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doesn’t	look	like	she	was	hit	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	thank	God,”	I	said	a	little	too	loudly	as	several	shoppers	turned	to	look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 mean,	 the	 woman	 is	 still	 dead,	 and	 that’s	 still	 horrible.	 But	 I	 didn’t	 like thinking	she’d	died	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	didn’t	say	that.”	The	sheriff	looked	a	little	sheepish	as	I	gave	him	a squinty	 look.	 “I	 said	 she	 wasn’t	 hit	 here.	 But	 it	 does	 look	 like	 she	 stumbled	 in here,	maybe	to	hide.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 puffed	 up	 my	 cheeks.	 “Would	 she	 have	 been	 able	 to	 credit	 card	 my	 door with	a	head	injury	like	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Human	beings	are	capable	of	a	great	many	things	when	driven	by	necessity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	not	sure	that’s	what	happened,	but	it	seems	likely.	We	found	Stevensmith’s fingerprints	on	the	outside	of	the	door.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	and	lowered	my	voice.	“Okay,	so	she	did	die	here.	I	suppose	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">few	 years	 we	 might	 be	 able	 to	 trot	 out	 her	 ghost	 for	 a	 spooky	 book	 night.”	 I immediately	winced	as	the	words	left	my	mouth.	“Too	soon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope.	You’re	thinking	like	a	business	woman,	and	I	like	it.	Plus,	the	ghost</p>
<p class="calibre1">tours	around	here	are	pretty	epic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	laughed.	I	loved	when	older	people	like	me	used	slang,	especially	when	it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a><img src="index-23_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">was	a	little	behind	the	times.	“I’ll	make	a	note.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">FROM	HER	NOW-RECLINING	position	on	the	floor,	Mart	said,	“Did	the	sheriff	have any	leads	on	the	murder?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	 that	 he	 told	 me.”	 In	 fact,	 he’d	 as	 much	 as	 told	 me	 to	 stop	 asking questions	 when	 I’d	 asked.	 “He	 was	 pretty	 tight-lipped.	 But	 I	 have	 some theories.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	sat	up.	“Ooh,	I	love	a	good	theory.	Tell	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”	 I	 said,	 resting	 my	 elbows	 on	 my	 knees,	 “It’s	 not	 like	 Stevensmith was	 everybody’s	 favorite	 person.	 Did	 you	 meet	 Ms.	 Heron	 when	 she	 came	 in today?	 White	 woman	 about	 my	 height.	 Blonde	 hair	 to	 her	 chin.	 Mud	 on	 her shirt.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	yes,	I	remember	her.	I	wondered	about	the	mud.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	 grows	 her	 flowers	 and	 veggies	 and	 then	 sells	 them	 at	 that	 little	 farm stand	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 street.	 She’d	 been	 planting	 potatoes	 all	 day.	 Hence	 the dirt.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	nodded.	“Got	it.	What	about	her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	stopped	by	earlier	in	the	week	to	see	if	I	wanted	to	buy	any	flowers	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 café	 tables	 when	 they	 were	 ready.	 She’d	 seen	 Stevensmith’s	 article	 and wanted	 to	 show	 her	 support,	 one	 business	 woman	 to	 another.	 While	 she	 was here,	she	told	me	that	Stevensmith	had	slammed	her	stand	when	it	first	opened.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 tried	 my	 best	 imitation	 of	 Heron’s	 thick,	 Eastern	 Maryland	 accent,	 “She	 said my	carrots	were	dirty	and	my	zinnias	‘limpid.’	I	wanted	to	kill	the	woman.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ooh,	and	then,	there	she	is	dead.”	Mart’s	eyes	were	wide,	and	I	could	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	wheels	of	suspicion	turning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly.	I	don’t	think	Eleanor	would	do	that,	but	it	was	interesting.	Sheriff said	there	wasn’t	much	love	lost	for	the	old	reporter.	Kind	of	makes	me	feel	bad for	the	woman	–	I	mean	I	feel	bad	she’s	dead	–	but,	well,	she	was	a	pretty	serious pain	in	the	tuckus.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	putting	it	mildly.”	Mart	laid	back	down	on	the	floor	and	stared	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>ceiling.	“But	let’s	talk	about	the	important	stuff.	That	mechanic	and	his	pup	were sure	cute.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayhem,	 who	 had	 been	 snoring	 away	 on	 her	 dog	 bed	 by	 the	 cash	 register, sat	up	at	the	mention	of	Taco.	They’d	taken	an	immediate	liking	to	each	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	laughed,	“Like	owner	like	dog. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tried	to	act	cool	by	draping	my	legs	over	one	end	of	the	chair	and	lacing	my fingers	 behind	 my	 head,	 but	 Mart	 was	 on	 to	 me.	 “Oh	 my	 gracious.	 You	 like him!”	She	sat	up.	“You	like	him	a	lot!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	my	face	was	as	red	as	the	spine	on	the	Everyman’s	Library	edition	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Love	in	the	Time	of	Cholera</i>.	There	was	no	hiding	it.	I	had	a	crush. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	had	come	in	around	lunch	with	Taco	on	a	leash.	The	dog	walked	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	store	like	he’d	been	visiting	bookshops	all	his	life.	Daniel	unhooked	him,	and the	 Basset	 walked	 to	 the	 dog	 bed	 by	 the	 animal	 section	 and	 climbed	 in, stretching	his	full	length	so	his	head	draped	onto	the	floor.	“He	does	know	how to	make	himself	comfortable,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 he	 does.	 He’s	 never	 met	 a	 bed	 he	 didn’t	 like.”	 Daniel	 was	 grinning with	pride. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled.	“Glad	you	guys	could	come.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wouldn’t	have	missed	it.”	He	smiled	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	remembering	his	visit	brought	my	grin	right	back.	“And	you	know	what, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart?”	I	gave	up	all	pretense	of	nonchalance.	“He	bought	a	copy	of	 <i class="calibre4">Possession</i> because	I	recommended	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 recommended	 that	 a	 mechanic	 who	 doesn’t	 really	 read	 buy	 a	 book about	two	English	academics	who	fall	in	love?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	did.”	I	had	felt	kind	of	proud	of	myself	for	the	brazenness,	but	was	quickly deflated	by	Mart’s	practicality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	if	he	hates	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sighed.  <i class="calibre4">Oh	no,	what	if	he	did? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	my	mind	could	slide	off	into	worst-case	scenarios,	Mart	reminded	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	odd	happening	from	the	day.	“Who	was	that	young	guy,	the	one	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">skateboard	and	the	hair	a	la	Fresh	Prince?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	just	who	she	was	talking	about.	A	young	black	man	–	maybe	about</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a><img src="index-25_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty	 –	 had	 come	 in	 and	 asked	 if	 we	 had	 a	 restroom.	 I’d	 pointed	 him	 to	 the back	of	the	store	then	didn’t	think	anything	of	it	until	a	while	later	when	he	came by	the	counter	again.	“You’re	out	of	paper	towels,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	 no.	 I’ll	 take	 care	 of	 that	 right	 away,”	 I	 said	 as	 I	 turned	 to	 go	 to	 the cabinet	where	we	kept	supplies	by	the	bathrooms	“Thanks	for	telling	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Least	I	could	do	since	I	used	the	last	two	rolls.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stopped	 my	 jog	 to	 the	 storeroom	 just	 as	 Mart	 came	 up	 to	 the	 counter.	 I turned	back	to	the	customer.	“Are	you	okay?	Were	you	sick	or	something?	I	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	you	a	ginger	ale.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 shrugged.	 “Oh	 no,	 I’m	 fine.	 Sorry	 for	 using	 all	 your	 paper	 towels.”	 He waved	and	then	headed	back	out	to	the	street	with	his	skateboard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	and	I	watched	him	cross	the	street	and	head	off	further	into	town.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">then,	 a	 customer	 came	 up	 to	 ask	 about	 wine	 books,	 and	 Mart	 was	 off	 in	 her element.	And	I	rushed	to	refill	the	paper	towels	in	the	men’s	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Standing	 up	 from	 the	 chair	 and	 stretching,	 I	 said,	 “Yeah,	 that	 was	 odd.	 But the	bathroom	was	immaculate	after	he	was	in	there.	I	just	hope	he	was	okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	pried	herself	off	the	floor.	“Guess	we	can	head	home?	Unless	you	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">want	to	sleep	here	to	save	us	the	trouble.”	I	was	tempted,	but	Aslan	would	have my	hide	if	I	didn’t	come	home	to	feed	her	and	tend	her,	er,	facilities.	She	was	a very	particular	cat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	NEXT	DAY,	the	shop	was	hopping	again.	News	of	Stevensmith’s	murder	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	Sunday	paper,	and	that,	coupled	with	the	great	coverage	that	the	 <i class="calibre4">Baltimore</i> <i class="calibre4">Sun</i>	had	done	about	the	shop	meant	we	were	even	more	crowded	than	we’d	been the	 day	 before.	 A	 couple	 of	 visitors	 even	 asked	 if	 they	 could	 see	 “where	 it happened,”	 and	 I	 had	 to	 politely	 decline	 the	 prurient	 requests,	 including	 one from	 Max	 Davies,	 the	 owner	 of	 Chez	 Cuisine,	 the	 local	 pseudo-French</p>
<p class="calibre1">restaurant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Too	bad,”	Davies	said.	“I	kind	of	wanted	to	revel	in	the	place	of	her	death.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	must	not	have	been	good	at	hiding	my	look	of	horror	because	he	said,	“Oh, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>come	on.	I	know	you	met	her.	She	wasn’t	the	most	likeable	person	after	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	no,”	I	had	to	admit,	“but	the	woman	was	murdered.	Maybe	reveling</p>
<p class="calibre1">isn’t	the	kindest	reaction?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	she	had	tried	to	shut	down	your	business,	you	might	feel	differently.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	tried	to	shut	you	down?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hm-mm.	 Twice.	 Once	 when	 she	 wrote	 a	 scathing	 review	 of	 our	 escargot and	 called	 them,	 ‘Elasticine.’	 My	 snails	 are	 fresh	 and	 succulent,	 I’ll	 have	 you know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	vigorously	because	it	seemed	like	it	was	in	my	best	interest	to	stay</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	Davies’	good	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	second	time,	I	know	she	was	behind	this	trumped-up	health	department</p>
<p class="calibre1">complaint.	I’ve	never	had	rats	in	my	kitchen.”	He	sniffed	as	if	the	very	idea	was preposterous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	made	a	mental	note	to	steer	clear	of	Chez	Cuisine.	Rats	or	not,	I	didn’t	feel like	 I	 really	 needed	 to	 take	 in	 any	 atmosphere	 Davies	 created.	 Still,	 a	 good neighbor	 is	 often	 a	 quiet	 neighbor,	 so	 I	 listened	 attentively	 and	 then	 asked	 his suggestion	 for	 the	 cookbooks	 we	 should	 carry.	 “It’s	 about	 time	 someone	 asked my	 expertise	 on	 things	 around	 this	 town,”	 he	 said	 as	 he	 snatched	 the	 notebook and	pen	from	my	hand	and	headed	toward	the	cooking	section. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 caught	 Rocky’s	 eye	 in	 the	 café,	 and	 she	 doubled	 over	 laughing.	 Guess Davies	had	a	reputation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Traffic	into	the	shop	kept	the	bell	over	the	door	dinging	steadily,	and	I	barely had	time	to	help	customers	find	books	they	might	like	–	my	favorite	part	of	the job	 –	 before	 I	 had	 to	 ring	 up	 another	 sale.	 I	 knew	 it	 wouldn’t	 last	 forever	 this way,	 but	 I	 was	 pretty	 excited	 still.	 Last	 night’s	 quick	 tally	 showed	 we	 made	 a really	 good	 net	 profit	 for	 our	 first	 day,	 and	 today	 looked	 like	 it	 might	 be	 even better.	 At	 this	 rate,	 I	 might	 even	 be	 able	 to	 hire	 a	 clerk	 to	 help	 so	 that	 I	 didn’t have	to	be	at	the	shop	every	minute	it	was	open	.	.	.	although	I	kind	of	wanted	to be,	at	least	for	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	one	point	in	the	afternoon,	I	came	to	the	surprising	discovery	that	many	of the	books	in	both	of	my	window	displays	had	been	purchased,	so	I	flagged	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	 as	 she	 hustled	 about	 straightening	 shelves	 and	 answering	 questions	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>asked	 her	 to	 cover	 the	 register	 for	 me	 so	 I	 could	 restock.	 One	 or	 two	 books missing	from	a	window	display	made	the	shop	look	good;	only	one	or	two	left</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	it	look	derelict. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 headed	 to	 the	 storeroom,	 bracing	 myself	 to	 enter.	 I’d	 been	 avoiding	 the space.	 But	 my	 extra	 copies	 of	 Catherine	 Clinton’s	 book	 were	 in	 there,	 and	 I thought	 I	 had	 a	 few	 more	 gardening	 titles	 that	 I’d	 been	 saving	 for	 later	 in	 the spring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stepped	 inside	 and	 let	 out	 the	 breath	 I’d	 been	 holding.	 The	 room	 looked normal,	 very	 normal	 in	 fact.	 No	 police	 tape.	 No	 chalk	 outline	 on	 the	 floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing	at	all	to	indicate	that	a	person	had	died	there.	The	business	owner	in	me was	 glad	 of	 that,	 but	 the	 person	 who	 loved	 people,	 she	 was	 sad.	 I	 sat	 down gently	 on	 a	 box	 of	 cups	 for	 the	 café	 and	 took	 a	 moment.	 I	 knew	 Stevensmith wasn’t	here	–	she	didn’t	seem	the	type	to	haunt	a	simple	bookstore.	If	her	spirit was	 lingering,	 it	 had	 grander	 aspirations	 –	 but	 I	 still	 felt	 like	 saying	 something was	in	order.	“Ms.	Stevensmith,	I	know	you	found	my	little	shop	lacking,	but	I still	appreciate	that	you	came	and	wrote	about	us.	Thank	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	heard	a	rustle	to	my	left	and	jumped	up	to	see	who	was	there.	A	tiny,	white</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman	in	a	polka	dot	raincoat	was	in	the	doorway.	“Can	I	help	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 I’m	 sorry,	 dear.	 I	 didn’t	 mean	 to	 startle	 you.	 I	 was	 looking	 for	 the bathroom,	but	I	see	I’ve	made	a	wrong	turn.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 hustled	 over	 to	 her.	 “Of	 course.	 Let	 me	 show	 you	 the	 way.”	 I	 gestured behind	her,	but	she	didn’t	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lucia	 actually	 liked	 your	 shop,	 you	 know?	 I	 know	 she	 didn’t	 show	 that well,	 but	 she	 was	 thrilled	 that	 you	 were	 opening.	 ‘About	 time	 we	 had	 a bookstore	in	St.	Marin’s,’	she	said.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stepped	 back	 so	 I	 could	 look	 the	 woman	 in	 the	 face.	 “You	 knew	 Ms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stevensmith?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	of	course	I	did,	dear.	I	was	her	mother.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	a	step	backward	in	surprise.	“Oh	my	goodness.	I’m	so	sorry.”	Fatigue</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 embarrassment	 made	 me	 fumble	 my	 words.	 “I	 didn’t	 know	 –	 I’m	 so	 sorry for	your	loss.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 woman	 put	 a	 tiny	 hand	 on	 my	 arm.	 “It’s	 fine,	 dear.	 You’re	 new.	 How</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>would	you	know?	I’m	Divina	Stevensmith.	It’s	nice	to	meet	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	laid	my	hand	over	hers	and	found	her	skin	was	ice	cold.	“You’re	freezing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Can	I	get	you	a	cup	of	something	hot?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled.	“Maybe	after	I	go	to	the	bathroom?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	yes,	of	course.	Right	this	way.”	I	closed	the	storeroom	door	behind	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 walked	 her	 to	 the	 other	 side	 of	 the	 shop	 and	 pointed	 at	 the	 door.	 “Right there.	I’ll	wait	for	you	here,	if	that’s	okay,	and	then	maybe	we	can	have	coffee and	you	can	tell	me	a	bit	more	about	Ms.,	I	mean	Lucia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded	and	headed	to	the	door	in	small,	graceful	steps.	I	turned	back	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	store	to	wait,	but	then	got	pulled	away	by	a	customer	looking	for	a	book	that would	encourage	her	fourteen-year-old	son	to	read.	By	the	time	I	got	back,	the bathroom	door	was	ajar	and	Ms.	Stevensmith	was	nowhere	to	be	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 a	 quick	 glance	 around	 the	 shop	 to	 see	 if	 I	 could	 spot	 her	 brightly colored	 rain	 coat,	 I	 headed	 back	 to	 the	 storeroom	 to	 grab	 the	 books	 for	 the window	displays.	The	door	wasn’t	shut	tight,	and	I	was	pretty	sure	I’d	closed	it all	the	way.	That	felt	off,	but	then,	maybe	Rocky	had	come	in	for	supplies	for	the café	 or	 something.	 I	 didn’t	 have	 time	 to	 worry	 over	 nothing,	 so	 I	 grabbed	 my books,	and	headed	back	out	with	a	stack	of	titles	up	to	my	chin. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a><b class="calibre3">4</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">By	close	on	Sunday,	my	whole	body	ached,	and	I	was	more	tired	than	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	 I’d	 ever	 been,	 but	 I	 was	 giddy,	 too.	 The	 weekend’s	 sales	 had given	 my	 bank	 accounts	 a	 boost,	 but	 more	 importantly,	 I	 was	 feeling confident	that	I	could	do	this	thing,	that	I	might	not	have	to	mooch	off	of	Mart forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stayed	 behind	 at	 the	 store	 after	 everyone	 left	 just	 to	 straighten	 up	 and	 to enjoy	the	quiet	for	a	bit.	I	reshelved	all	the	books	that	had	been	left	around	over the	weekend.	I	checked	the	picture	books	in	the	kids’	section	to	be	sure	no	dust jackets	were	torn.	I	gave	Mayhem	a	good	rub	on	her	bed	by	the	register.	I	fussed with	the	chairs	in	the	perfectly	tidy	café	just	so	I	could	put	a	hand	to	everything in	the	shop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	I	dropped	into	the	wingback	chair	next	to	the	poetry	section	and	cried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Being	 super	 tired	 always	 made	 me	 a	 little	 weepy,	 but	 I	 was	 also	 immensely grateful	 for	 all	 the	 ways	 my	 friends	 and	 the	 people	 of	 St.	 Marin’s	 had	 rallied around	my	little	store.	Gratitude	made	me	weepy,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	finishing	up	my	private	crying	jag	when	I	heard	a	knock	at	the	window</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	realized,	with	a	shudder,	that	everyone	on	the	street	could	see	me	since	I	had left	all	the	lights	on.	Tomorrow	would	be	fun.	“Why	were	you	crying,	Harvey?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everything	okay,	Harvey?”	Sigh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayhem	 came	 to	 my	 side	 as	 I	 got	 up	 and	 went	 to	 the	 front	 of	 the	 shop.	 I shielded	my	eyes	so	I	could	see	past	the	reflection	of	the	Edison	bulbs,	and	I	felt</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>my	 mortification	 grow.	 There	 stood	 Daniel	 and	 Taco.	 Mayhem	 must	 have smelled	her	friend	because	her	tail	started	wagging	a	mile	a	minute.	I,	however, wanted	to	disappear	into	the	bookshelves	never	to	return. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	gestured	to	the	door	and	then	to	himself,	and	I	nodded.	Might	as	well</p>
<p class="calibre1">let	him	know	I’m	okay.	Maybe	he	could	spread	the	word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	unlocked	the	door,	and	Taco	trotted	on	in	and	gave	Mayhem	a	sniff	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 headed	 to	 the	 café	 to	 be	 sure	 Rocky	 and	 I	 had	 tended	 to	 all	 the	 crumbs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	 locked	 the	 door	 behind	 him	 with	 my	 keys	 that	 were	 hanging	 there	 and then	looked	at	me.	“Big	weekend.	Just	decompressing,	I	imagine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled.	That’s	precisely	what	it	had	been	–	a	release	–	and	I	was	heartened</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 he	 knew	 that.	 “Exactly.	 Most	 of	 my	 strong	 emotions	 –	 good	 and	 hard	 –</p>
<p class="calibre1">come	out	as	tears.	I’ve	just	always	been	that	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	get	it.	I	kind	of	think	you	might	be	healthier	than	a	lot	of	us	since	you	just let	it	all	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	thanks	for	that.”	I	tried	to	suppress	a	ridiculous	grin.	“You	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	 yeah,	 just	 out	 walking	 the	 canine	 slug.	 He	 usually	 has	 a	 pass	 up	 and back	on	Main	before	he	totally	refuses	to	walk	further	and	I	carry	him	the	rest	of the	way	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow.	 He’s	 not	 a	 lightweight	 pup.	 Maybe	 you	 should	 trade	 him	 in	 for	 a Pomeranian	if	you’re	going	to	have	to	carry	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	laughed.	“Nah,	no	trade-ins.	He’s	stuck	with	me.	I	have	contemplated</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	wagon	though.”	He	shifted	the	leash	from	one	hand	to	the	other.	“When	I	saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 lights	 on	 here,	 I	 thought	 maybe	 you	 and	 Mayhem	 would	 like	 to	 walk	 with us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	glanced	over	at	our	dogs,	who	had	now	taken	up	resting	positions	back	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	 by	 the	 front	 window.	 “Looks	 like	 they’re	 game.	 Just	 let	 me	 get	 my	 coat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 I	 should	 be	 clear	 –	 I’m	 not	 carrying	 anyone.	 Everyone	 gets	 home	 on	 their own	power.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Understood.	 You	 hear	 that,	 Taco?	 The	 lady	 is	 not	 hefting	 your	 big	 butt.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taco	wagged	his	tail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside,	 the	 air	 was	 brisk,	 and	 I	 worried	 for	 the	 daffodils	 that	 had	 begun showing	 their	 sunny	 faces	 in	 the	 warm	 sun	 of	 the	 weekend.	 Mayhem’s	 leash</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>rested	 lightly	 around	 my	 right	 wrist	 as	 I	 pulled	 on	 my	 mittens.	 “Ready	 to	 go when	you	are.	Were	you	on	your	way	up	Main	Street	or	back?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Back.	 I	 was	 hoping	 you	 and	 Mayhem	 would	 motivate	 Taco	 to	 go	 a	 bit further,	but	I	didn’t	want	to	take	my	chances	that	his	enthusiasm	would	wear	off too	soon	and	you’d	have	to	see	me	try	to	lift	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 laughed.	 “He	 doesn’t	 look	 light,”	 I	 said	 as	 I	 eyed	 the	 sizable	 belly	 on	 the low-slung	pooch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	isn’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	walked	along	in	comfortable	silence	for	a	bit,	and	I	enjoyed	the	chance	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">look	into	the	shop	windows	and	admire	the	window	displays.	Even	Heron’s	farm</p>
<p class="calibre1">stand	 was	 decked	 out	 for	 spring	 with	 beautiful	 3-D	 flowers	 made	 from	 folded paper	taped	to	the	windows	and	attached	to	wooden	dowels	in	vases	in	the	sills. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ms.	Heron	seems	nice,”	I	said	almost	to	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	is,	although	I’m	not	sure	most	folks	would	call	her	nice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gave	him	a	look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I	don’t	mean	that	she’s	not	kind.	Just	that	she’s	a	force.	You	know	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">runs	 her	 farm	 and	 this	 farm	 stand	 by	 herself?	 Sometimes	 for	 harvest,	 she	 hires local	 teenagers,	 but	 mostly,	 she	 does	 it	 all	 –	 the	 planting,	 the	 weeding,	 the marketing.	I	don’t	think	she	sleeps.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	looked	tired	when	she’d	stopped	by	the	shop	today	to	check	on	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">order	 of	 daffodils	 for	 the	 café	 tables.	 “That	 must	 be	 exhausting.	 Just	 the	 shop tires	me	out,	and	I	don’t	have	to	grow	the	books	myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	reached	the	end	of	Main	Street,	and	I	felt	a	little	sad	that	our	walk	hadn’t lasted	longer.	But	I	was	tired	and	wanted	to	get	home	before	the	fatigue	turned my	legs	and	my	brain	to	mush.	“This	is	my	turn,”	I	said,	pointing	east. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	you’re	on	the	water	side.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am.	That	was	one	of	the	requirements	for	wherever	I	lived	–	a	water	view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 got	 spoiled	 in	 San	 Francisco	 with	 water	 on	 three	 sides	 of	 the	 city	 and	 the Pacific	Ocean	and	Golden	Gate	within	walking	distance	of	my	apartment.	Plus,	I love	this	water.	I	grew	up	on	the	Bay.	It’ll	always	be	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	know	you	were	from	around	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well	not	here	exactly.	Just	up	the	road	in	Cecil	County,	Chesapeake	City.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a><img src="index-32_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 love	 that	 town.	 Did	 they	 build	 the	 canal	 through	 it,	 or	 did	 the	 town	 just grow	up	around	the	canal?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	canal	brought	the	town,	definitely.”	I	thought	about	the	charming	town</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	I’d	hated	in	high	school.	No	teenager	likes	for	everyone	to	know	everything about	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	up	into	his	face.	He	was	smiling,	and	his	face	was	so	kind.	“Thanks</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	this,	Daniel.	It	was	really	nice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Agreed.	Maybe	another	evening	we	can	do	it	again	.	.	.	or	even	take	a	walk</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	the	water.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 grinned.	 “I’d	 like	 that.	 Have	 a	 good	 night.”	 I	 gave	 Mayhem	 a	 tug	 and headed	 down	 the	 street	 to	 our	 house,	 eager	 to	 tell	 Mart,	 well,	 everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly,	I	didn’t	feel	quite	as	tired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">MONDAY	 MORNING	 CAME	 EARLY,	 but	 I	 woke	 with	 gusto.	 A	 new	 shipment	 of books	was	coming	in,	and	I	couldn’t	wait	to	open	the	boxes,	smell	the	ink	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">paper,	and	get	shelving.	There’s	just	something	so	satisfying	about	putting	things away,	 and	 when	 those	 things	 are	 bound	 collections	 of	 stories	 and	 information, it’s	even	more	fun,	at	least	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rocky	came	in	not	long	after	I	arrived	at	the	store,	this	time	with	a	tray	full of	cookies.	“Your	mom	was	baking	again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I	made	these.	I	was	so	keyed	up	from	the	weekend	that	I	couldn’t	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	I	baked.	Spring-themed	sugar	cookies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 walked	 over	 to	 take	 a	 look	 and	 saw	 an	 assortment	 of	 flowers	 and	 rabbits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These	are	beautiful.	You	decorated	these	by	hand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 blush	 spread	 over	 Rocky’s	 cheeks.	 “I	 did.	 I’m	 just	 learning,	 but	 I	 think they	came	out	okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay?	These	are	amazing!	And	I	bet	they	taste	as	good	as	they	look.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	turned	toward	the	counter	with	a	smile.	“Let	me	get	the	coffee	brewed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	we’ll	find	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	like	how	you	think.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a><img src="index-33_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Today	was	going	to	be	the	first	day	Rocky	and	I	were	on	our	own.	Mart	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	spend	some	time	at	the	winery	and	then	she	was	off	to	the	mainland	to	consult with	a	winery	up	in	Westminster.	Over	breakfast,	she’d	offered	to	stay	home.	“Or I	can	drive	back	tonight.	I’ll	do	that.	It’ll	be	fine.	I’ll	just	caffeinate—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mart,	you	will	do	no	such	thing.	We	will	be	fine.	I	will	be	fine.	I	have	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">trusty	sidekick	here,”	I	gave	Mayhem	a	nudge	with	my	foot,	“And	I	have	friends in	town	if	I	need	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Friends	like	Daniel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rolled	my	eyes.	“What	are	we,	twelve?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	it	comes	to	boys,	yes,	we	are	twelve.”	She	grabbed	her	briefcase	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">headed	toward	the	door.	“You’ll	call	if	you	need	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	won’t	need	you,	but	yes,	and	you’ll	text	when	you	get	to	your	hotel?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,	Mom.”	She	gave	me	a	kiss	on	the	cheek	and	headed	out	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">NOW,	I	was	missing	her	presence	in	the	shop.	Having	her	there	made	me	sure	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself,	 confident	 that	 she’d	 have	 my	 back.	 But	 I	 took	 a	 deep	 breath,	 glanced over	at	Rocky,	and	steadied	my	shoulders.	We	had	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	opened	at	ten	a.m.,	and	within	moments,	a	few	folks	had	come	in	to	grab</p>
<p class="calibre1">coffee	from	the	café.	No	real	book	shopping	happened	on	Monday	mornings,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew.	Most	of	us	had	too	much	ahead	of	us	in	the	week	to	think	about	reading, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	I	enjoyed	the	chance	to	catch	up	on	the	industry	news,	check	out	upcoming</p>
<p class="calibre1">releases,	and	brainstorm	a	few	ideas	for	author	events. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	a	quirky	notion	for	a	“Welcome	to	Spring”	celebration	for	late	March, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	wanted	to	see	if	I	might	be	able	to	get	David	Healey,	a	local	author,	down for	a	reading	from	his	Delmarva	Renovators	mystery	series.	His	books	were	set</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 my	 hometown,	 and	 I	 thought	 I	 could	 probably	 get	 a	 good	 crowd	 from	 there and	here	in	for	the	event,	especially	if	the	restaurants	in	town	might	do	a	special something	for	folks	coming	to	the	reading.	I	got	to	giggling	as	I	thought	about how	Max	Davies	might	try	to	redeem	his	chewy	snails. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 was	 so	 focused	 on	 how	 we	 could	 do	 a	 murder	 mystery	 party	 after	 dinner</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>that	I	was	surprised	when	someone	cleared	their	throat	just	on	the	other	side	of the	counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	up	to	see	Sheriff	Mason	grinning	at	me.	“You	are	enjoying	yourself, </p>
<p class="calibre1">huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	blushed.	“I	am.	Planning	some	events	for	the	store.	It’s	really	fun.	Do	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	mysteries?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Live	them	every	day,	so	I’d	say	so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah	yes.”	I	closed	my	laptop	and	came	out	from	behind	the	counter.	“What</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	I	do	for	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	just	wanted	to	update	you	on	the	investigation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 right.	 Okay.	 Do	 you	 want	 to	 sit	 in	 the	 café?”	 I	 scanned	 the	 shop.	 Just one	 woman	 browsing	 in	 the	 poetry	 section,	 so	 I	 was	 pretty	 sure	 I	 had	 a	 few minutes.	Poetry	readers	are	devoted,	but	the	books	weren’t	our	hottest	ticket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	took	a	seat	by	the	garage	door	that	I’d	had	converted	to	mostly	glass,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rocky	 brought	 us	 two	 cappuccinos	 –	 she	 knew	 the	 sheriff’s	 preference	 –	 with little	flowers	in	the	foam.	“Very	cute,”	Mason	said	with	a	chuckle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks.	I	figured	you	needed	something	adorable	in	your	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Always,”	 he	 said	 as	 he	 took	 a	 long	 swig	 from	 the	 mug.	 “Delicious.	 This from	that	roaster	down	in	Easton?	–	because	it’s	amazing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep.”	 I	 had	 been	 thrilled	 to	 see	 that	 a	 local	 company	 was	 roasting	 coffee right	 on	 the	 Eastern	 Shore	 and	 had	 arranged	 to	 get	 all	 our	 beans	 from	 them.	 I liked	to	keep	things	as	local	as	I	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 watched	 Rocky	 walk	 back	 to	 the	 counter	 to	 wait	 on	 her	 next	 customer before	I	leaned	over	and	asked,	“Okay,	so	what’s	the	story?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	much	story,	I’m	afraid.	You	already	knew	Stevensmith	had	been	hit	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	probably	come	in	here	to	hide.	That’s	still	our	best	theory.	We	do	know	that she	 was	 clobbered	 with	 something	 that	 left	 a	 curved	 mark	 in	 her	 skull,	 but	 we still	don’t	know	what	that	something	was.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	leaned	back	in	my	chair	and	sipped	my	drink.	“Man,	that’s	not	much	to	go</p>
<p class="calibre1">on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	 No,	 it’s	 not,”	 the	 sheriff	 scooted	 in,	 “but	 this	 helps.”	 He	 slid	 a	 little plastic	bag	toward	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>I	picked	it	up	and	pulled	it	close	to	my	face.	“A	piece	of	bright	orange	paper? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Okay,	fill	me	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 brought	 it	 by	 because	 I	 thought	 it	 might	 be	 a	 piece	 from	 a	 book	 cover, something	 that	 might	 give	 us	 a	 bit	 more	 of	 the	 story	 about	 Stevensmith’s	 steps that	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	scrutinized	the	triangular	sliver	again.	“I	can’t	say	as	I	recognize	that	color or	 that	 paper	 texture	 from	 any	 of	 our	 books	 or	 even	 from	 the	 little	 bit	 of stationery	we	stock.”	I	pointed	to	a	spinning	rack	near	the	register.	“I	don’t	think this	came	from	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	you’d	be	disappointed,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	 no.	 If	 it’s	 not	 from	 here,	 then	 it’s	 from	 somewhere	 else,	 and	 that somewhere	else	might	just	be	the	murder	scene.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 scraped	 his	 chair	 back	 from	 the	 table	 and	 stood.	 “Thanks,	 Harvey.	 I’ll keep	you	updated	as	I’m	able.	But	of	course,	you	know	I	can’t	really	talk	about too	many	details.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course.	And	as	I	find	info,	I’ll	pass	it	on,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	you	find	info?	Harvey,	you	know	Williams	and	I	can	handle	this,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 began	 walking	 toward	 the	 front	 door.	 “Of	 course,	 I	 do.	 I’m	 just	 nosy	 I guess.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	nosy	can	be	dangerous.	Best	to	let	us	do	the	nosing	around,	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shivered,	remembering	all	too	well	how	true	his	statement	was.	“I’ll	do	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">best.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shook	his	head.	“You’re	a	stubborn	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	better	believe	it.	Wouldn’t	be	here,”	I	did	a	little	spin	in	the	shop,	“if that	wasn’t	the	case?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could	hear	the	sheriff	laughing	as	he	walked	to	his	SUV. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	spent	the	rest	of	the	morning	ordering	books	to	replace	those	we	had	sold</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	the	weekend,	and	I	even	bulked	up	our	inventory	a	bit	with	the	profit	we’d made.	 But	 in	 the	 back	 of	 my	 mind,	 I	 was	 trying	 to	 figure	 out	 just	 why	 that particular	shade	of	orange	had	seemed	so	familiar. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a><img src="index-36_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">THAT	 AFTERNOON,	 I	 was	 just	 reorganizing	 the	 religion	 section	 –	 those	 spiritual folks	could	de-alphabetize	shelves	like	nobody’s	business	–	when	I	heard	the	bell chime.	 I	 pried	 myself	 up	 off	 the	 floor	 from	 among	 the	 stacks	 of	 books	 and stepped	out,	right	into	a	woman	about	my	age	with	a	long,	ponytail	of	silver	hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I’m	so	sorry.	Goodness,	you’re	quick.	I	just	heard	you	come	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	so	sorry.	I	want	to	shop,	but	can	I—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep,	just	over	there.	Door	on	the	left.”	I	had	been	that	person	chagrined	but in	need	when	it	came	to	a	bathroom.	When	I	opened	the	shop,	I	vowed	to	never</p>
<p class="calibre1">refuse	its	use	to	anyone.	It	was	just	so	mortifying	to	have	to	bounce	around	while you	waited	in	line	to	get	a	key. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	back	to	reshelving	until	I	felt	a	hand	on	my	back	and	stood	to	see	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman	standing	beside	me.	“Thank	you	so	much.	You	have	no	idea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I	expect	I	have	some	idea.	Been	there,	done	that.	Happy	to	help.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	thank	you.”	She	extended	a	hand	and	then	smiled.	“I	did	wash.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	her	hand.	“I’m	Harvey.	This	is	my	shop.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 so	 glad	 to	 meet	 you,	 Harvey,	 and	 so	 glad	 you’re	 here.	 Ever	 since	 I moved	to	St.	Marin’s	a	few	years	back,	I’ve	thought	we	needed	a	bookstore.	I’m Cate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 detected	 a	 little	 Deep	 South	 accent	 in	 this	 slightly	 plump	 and	 very	 stylish Asian	woman.	“So	you’re	not	from	here	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	no.	I	moved	up	from	Atlanta	about	eight	years	ago.	My	husband	directs</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	maritime	museum,	and	I	paint.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 did	 I	 need	 you	 last	 week?”	 I	 gestured	 toward	 the	 white-washed	 brick and	then	gave	Cate	a	sideways	wink.	“Just	kidding.	What	do	you	paint?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed.	“You’d	be	surprised	how	many	calls	I	get	to	give	estimates	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">painting	 barns.”	 She	 looked	 at	 me	 intently.	 “Or	 maybe	 you	 wouldn’t.	 I	 expect not	much	gets	past	you.”	She	smiled.	“I	paint	landscapes	mostly,	a	lot	of	scenes of	the	water	here,	obviously.	But	my	passion	is	portraits.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	interesting.	Do	you	get	commissions	for	portraits	often?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope.	But	that’s	okay	with	me.	I’m	not	much	for	sitting	in	a	room	painting</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>someone	else	sitting	in	a	room.	My	preference	is	to	do	portraits	of	people	as	they work.	 The	 watermen	 around	 here	 –	 those	 old-timers	 who	 have	 been	 on	 a	 boat every	day	of	every	decade	in	their	life	–	their	faces	have	so	much	story	in	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 knew	 then	 and	 there	 that	 Cate	 and	 I	 would	 be	 good	 friends.	 Anyone	 who can	see	the	story	in	a	person’s	face	was	someone	I	wanted	to	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	sometime	you’d	let	me	paint	you?”	she	asked	with	a	steady	gaze	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 turned	 away	 and	 grabbed	 a	 stack	 of	 Barbara	 Brown	 Taylor	 books.	 “Why me?	My	face	has	been	in	a	cubicle	for	most	of	the	last	twenty	years.	Not	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">story	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I	know	that’s	not	true.	I	can	see	it	at	the	edges	of	your	eyes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	the	crow’s	feet	tell	the	tale.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something	like	that,”	Cate	said.	“Now,	where’s	your	art	section?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 and	 I	 spent	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 afternoon	 looking	 at	 art	 books	 with	 her guiding	me	to	some	new	ones	I	should	add	to	give	the	section	a	good	foundation and	pointing	out	others	that	I	might	want	to	return	since	they	didn’t	have	the	best quality	 images	 or	 because	 she	 knew	 that	 the	 artists	 hadn’t	 been	 fairly compensated	 for	 their	 work	 in	 the	 pages.	 I	 was	 usually	 loathe	 to	 return	 books, even	 though	 I	 got	 reimbursed	 for	 what	 I’d	 spent	 on	 them,	 but	 if	 the	 artists	 had been	cheated,	that	was	a	no	brainer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	 the	 time	 we’d	 reviewed	 the	 whole	 section	 and	 I’d	 rung	 up	 the	 couple dozen	customers	who	had	come	through	–	almost	everyone	who	came	in	bought</p>
<p class="calibre1">something,	 a	 true	 kindness	 from	 my	 neighbors	 –	 it	 was	 getting	 dark	 and	 was almost	time	to	close	up	shop.	“Oh	my	word,	I’ve	been	here	all	day,	and	I	really just	stopped	in	to	say	hello,	pick	up	the	latest	issue	of	 <i class="calibre4">Where	Women	Create</i>,	and of	course,	pee.	I’m	so	sorry	for	taking	all	your	time.”	Cate	pulled	out	the	hair	tie and	smoothed	her	hair	back	into	its	sleek	ponytail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	gracious,	please.	I	had	a	great	time,	and	you	really	helped	me	with	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">art	section.	Thank	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	 sure	 how	 much	 help	 I	 was,”	 she	 said	 picking	 up	 the	 magazine	 she’d come	for,	one	of	my	favorites,	too,	“but	it’s	almost	dinner	time.	If	you	don’t	have plans,	 come	 on	 home	 with	 me,	 meet	 Lucas,	 and	 have	 dinner.	 Mondays	 are</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a><img src="index-38_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="index-38_2.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">always	pasta	nights,	so	we	can	fortify	for	the	week	ahead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	 had	 texted	 to	 say	 she	 was	 safe	 and	 sound	 in	 Westminster,	 and	 I	 had been	 planning	 on	 a	 bowl	 of	 cereal	 for	 dinner.	 This	 sounded	 far	 better.	 “Sure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thanks.	 I’ll	 just	 close	 up	 here,	 drop	 Mayhem	 off	 at	 home,”	 as	 if	 on	 cue,	 the pooch	stretched	and	squeaked	with	pleasure,	“then	I’ll	be	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yay.	I’ll	help	you	close	up,	and	please	bring	Mayhem.	Our	little	Sasquatch</p>
<p class="calibre1">loves	other	dogs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	let	out	a	burst	of	a	laugh.	“You	have	a	dog	named	Sasquatch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure	do.	He’s	a	miniature	Schnauzer.	All	fur	and	personality.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">IT	 DIDN’T	 TAKE	 us	 long	 to	 help	 Rocky	 wipe	 down	 the	 café	 tables,	 and	 I	 turned out	 the	 lights	 as	 the	 three	 of	 us	 headed	 toward	 the	 door.	 “Rocky,	 want	 to	 join us?”	Cate	asked	as	we	stepped	out	onto	the	sidewalk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	thank	you,	but	I	need	to	get	home	and	do	homework.	Plus,	Mama	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	curry	soup,	and	I	cannot	miss	that	goodness.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	ma’am,	you	cannot,”	Cate	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">MOST	 EVERYTHING	 in	 the	 town	 of	 St.	 Marin’s	 was	 within	 walking	 distance,	 so when	we	turned	up	a	side	street	away	from	the	water	–	 <i class="calibre4">toward	Daniel’s	side	of</i> <i class="calibre4">town</i>,	 I	 found	 myself	 thinking	 –	 I	 was	 delighted.	 I	 loved	 this	 street	 with	 its rambling	 Victorians	 towering	 above	 cute	 Craftsman	 cottages.	 Mart	 and	 I	 had thought	about	buying	something	small	on	this	very	lane,	but	the	lure	of	the	water had	taken	me	a	few	blocks	away,	over	by	where	the	museum	was.	We	strolled	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	far	end	of	the	street,	and	Cate	led	us	up	the	sidewalk	to	the	most	wonderfully out-of-place	home	on	the	block.	It	was	a	lean,	angular	modern	building	clad	in long,	thin	planks	of	what	looked	like	bamboo.	Windows	were	scattered	about	the front	in	a	pattern	that	I	liked,	but	couldn’t	describe.	The	trim	on	all	the	windows was	a	gunmetal	gray,	and	the	front	yard	was	covered	in	wood	chips	with	a	shrub</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>here	and	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	 the	 summer,	 this	 yard	 becomes	 a	 meadow	 of	 wildflowers.	 It’s	 a	 nice contrast	to	the	hard	lines	of	the	modern	house	design.	Sort	of	like	Lucas	and	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	spends	so	much	time	with	old	things	at	work	that	he	really	wanted	to	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">home	to	something	that	only	had	our	story	attached,	so	we	built	this	home	when we	moved	here.	The	wildflowers	are	my	way	of	softening	our	space,	blending	us</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	a	bit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	love	it,”	I	said	and	meant	it.	“Did	the	neighbors	object?”	I	could	see	how</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 of	 St.	 Marin’s	 more,	 um,	 traditional	 community	 members	 might	 have found	 the	 sleek	 design	 –	 and	 maybe	 the	 wildflowers	 too	 –	 in	 poor	 taste	 since they	didn’t	match	the	historical	design	of	most	of	the	town. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	 was	 some	 grumbling	 of	 course.	 Always	 is	 in	 a	 small	 town.	 But people	 like	 Lucas	 so	 much,	 they	 pretty	 much	 stayed	 quiet.”	 Cate’s	 voice	 was matter-of-fact	–	even.	She	clearly	didn’t	let	much	get	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 we	 went	 in	 through	 the	 full-glass	 double	 doors,	 I	 gasped.	 “Oh	 my goodness.	It’s	so	beautiful.”	The	doors	opened	into	a	long,	wide	hallway	with	a view	to	the	dining	room	and	kitchen	and	beyond	that	a	full	wall	of	windows	that looked	out	over	the	brackish	canal	that	ran	behind	the	house.	In	the	half-light,	I could	see	two	egrets	and	a	great	blue	heron	standing	sentry	in	the	reeds.	“That window.”	I	walked	right	to	it	and	stared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 heard	 a	 deep	 chuckle	 to	 my	 left	 and	 turned	 with	 embarrassment.	 There, apron	over	his	khakis	and	polo,	was	a	man	I	took	to	be	Lucas.	He	was	tall	–	well over	six	feet	–	and	thin,	reed-like	is	how	I	could	describe	him.	“The	view	gets everyone	the	first	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 put	 down	 the	 pasta	 spoon	 he	 had	 been	 holding,	 wiped	 his	 hands	 on	 the apron,	and	came	to	greet	me.	“I’m	Lucas.	Nice	to	meet	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	brought	home	my	new	friend.	I	expect	you	made	enough	pasta,”	Cate	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	she	flung	her	wool	cape	over	the	back	of	club	chair	in	the	living	room	just	in front	of	the	kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	Harvey,”	I	said	with	a	smile.	“And	that’s	Mayhem.”	My	pup	was	doing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	usual	sniff	and	greet	with	the	most	adorable	dog	I’d	ever	seen.	“This	must	be Sasquatch.	I	love	his	eyebrows.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>“Nice	to	meet	you,	Harvey.	Someday	I	need	to	know	the	story	of	that	name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 yes,	 that’s	 our	 resident	 pillow	 stealer.	 Guard	 yours	 if	 you	 ever	 stay	 over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’ve	been	warned,”	he	said	as	he	headed	back	to	his	work.	“Pasta	puttanesca</p>
<p class="calibre1">okay?	 I	 felt	 like	 capers	 today,	 and	 Merv	 down	 at	 the	 fish	 market	 had	 some amazing	anchovies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 tried	 not	 to	 wince.	 I	 wasn’t	 the	 biggest	 fan	 of	 seafood,	 which	 made	 me ridiculous	in	this	town	where	dinner	was	literally	out	the	window.	Something	in my	 face	 must	 have	 given	 me	 away	 because	 Cate	 asked,	 “Not	 a	 big	 fan	 of anchovies?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	really.	I	don’t	like	much	fish,	actually.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lucas	 gasped	 with	 mock	 horror.	 “That’s	 it.	 You’ll	 have	 to	 leave,”	 he	 said with	a	smile.	“Just	kidding.	Lucky	for	you,	I	cook	the	anchovies	separately	so	I can	mince	them	over	the	top,	so	I’ll	just	leave	them	off	your	plate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 sighed	 with	 relief.	 “Thanks.	 If	 you	 have	 a	 tiny	 bit	 I	 can	 try,	 I’m	 always game.	Just	anchovies	.	.	.	“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	 the	 stuff	 of	 pizza	 nightmares,	 I	 know.”	 Lucas	 turned	 the	 big saucepan	 full	 of	 pasta	 and	 veggies	 with	 tongs.	 “Trust	 me,	 these	 are	 not	  <i class="calibre4">those</i> anchovies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wine?”	Cate	said	holding	up	a	glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	poured	me	a	glass	of	a	gorgeous	pinot	noir,	and	I	savored	my	first	sip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	 Lucas	 plated	 our	 food	 and	 we	 sat	 down	 at	 their	 long,	 blonde	 table.	 The conversation	wandered	from	Lucas’s	work	at	the	museum	to	my	shop	to	Cate’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">plan	for	a	series	of	portraits	of	the	oldest	residents	in	St.	Marin’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	time	I	was	done	with	my	second	glass	of	wine,	had	decided	anchovies</p>
<p class="calibre1">weren’t	 totally	 terrible,	 and	 gobbled	 down	 a	 vanilla	 cupcake	 that	 Lucas	 had picked	 up	 from	 the	 bakery	 in	 town,	 I	 was	 completely	 relaxed	 and	 felt	 right	 at home.	I	couldn’t	wait	to	introduce	Mart	to	Cate	and	Lucas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	my	phone	and	saw	it	was	after	ten.	“Oh	my.	I	better	get	home	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">feed	this	girl.”	I	looked	down	at	Mayhem,	who	was	asleep	on	her	side	at	my	feet, and	gave	her	a	nudge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually,	I	think	she	and	Sas	shared	dinner.	Hope	you	don’t	mind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a><img src="index-41_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	kidding?	Anyone	who	will	feed	me	and	my	dog	is	a	friend	for	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cate	 stood	 with	 me	 and	 grabbed	 my	 peacoat	 off	 the	 chair.	 “Thank	 you	 for coming.	 I’m	 so	 glad	 you’re	 part	 of	 our	 town,	 Harvey.”	 Her	 face	 grew	 more serious.	“I	know	the	shop	got	off	to	a	rough	start.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	almost	forgotten	about	the	murder,	which	I	felt	kind	of	bad	about.	“Did</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	know	Ms.	Stevensmith?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 did,”	 Lucas	 said	 as	 they	 walked	 me	 to	 the	 door.	 “She	 was	 an	 acquired taste,	let’s	say.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	how	most	everybody	describes	her.	My	experience	was	similar.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Still,	it’s	a	tragedy,”	Cate	said	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is.	The	sheriff	says	they’re	making	progress	on	the	investigation.”	I	didn’t know	 how	 much	 I	 could	 share	 of	 what	 the	 sheriff	 had	 told	 me,	 so	 I	 kept	 it simple. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.	 I	 don’t	 like	 the	 idea	 of	 having	 a	 murderer	 in	 our	 little	 town.”	 Cate shuddered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	on	that	note,	let	me	run	you	home,	Harvey.	It’s	late,	and	I	would	feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">better	if	you	weren’t	walking	alone.”	Lucas	was	already	grabbing	his	coat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled	gratefully.	“What?	You	don’t	think	this	girl	can	protect	me?”	I	gave</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	sleepy	dog	a	nudge	with	my	ankle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 I’m	 sure	 she	 would.	 But	 what	 if	 she	 hurts	 someone	 else?	 Best	 to	 just keep	all	our	citizens,	even	the	canine	ones,	safe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">AS	LUCAS	and	I	drove	the	few	blocks	to	my	house,	he	caught	me	up	on	all	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">quirky	people	in	town.	There	was	the	guy	who	pretended	to	be	homeless	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	tourists	were	around	and	made	a	good	enough	living	to	afford	his	Bentley	in the	off-season.	And	the	woman	who	wore	only	purple	ever.	“Rumor	has	it	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">everything	</i> she	wears	is	purple.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 guffawed.	 “Hey,	 maybe	 you	 can	 tell	 me	 about	 someone	 I	 met	 briefly	 the other	day.	Black	kid,	late	teens	or	early	twenties,	a	really	impressive	flat	top?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 you	 met	 Marcus.”	 Lucas’s	 voice	 had	 lost	 all	 the	 humor.	 “Marcus</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>Dawson.	He	went	to	Salisbury	U	for	a	few	years.	Rumor	has	it	that	he	was	uber-smart,	too	smart	for	his	own	good,	maybe.	For	whatever	reason,	he	flunked	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	moved	to	St.	Marin’s.	He	does	odd	jobs	for	folks	–	hard	worker	for	sure	–</p>
<p class="calibre1">but	kind	of	angry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmmm.	 He	 was	 pleasant	 enough	 for	 me,	 but	 he	 did	 use	 up	 at	 least	 two whole	rolls	of	paper	towels	in	the	bathroom	at	the	shop.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmph.	Maybe	he	doesn’t	have	great	aim?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	laughed	hard	as	Lucas	pulled	up	to	my	house.	I	loved	this	town. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a><b class="calibre3">5</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	morning,	Mayhem	and	I	took	a	little	more	circuitous	route	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 shop.	 That	 little	 piece	 of	 paper	 that	 Sheriff	 Mason	 had	 mentioned had	come	to	mind	as	I	scrambled	an	egg	that	morning	–	it	might	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	the	turmeric	that	I	threw	in	for	flavor	that	triggered	some	hint	of	a	memory, something	to	do	with	Main	Street.	So	the	hound	and	I	headed	out	early	to	see	if we	could	find	the	source	of	that	nibble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 walked	 past	 the	 park	 on	 the	 waterfront	 and	 took	 a	 left	 through	 our neighborhood	 of	 ranchers	 and	 cottages	 that	 were	 the	 homes	 to	 some	 of	 St. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marin’s	year-round	residents.	We	hung	a	right	on	Main	Street	and	went	past	the sail	 shop,	 the	 garden	 center,	 and	 the	 stately	 historic	 houses	 that	 had	 probably been	 home	 to	 ship	 builders	 back	 in	 the	 nineteenth	 century.	 As	 we	 passed	 the bookstore,	I	could	see	Rocky	inside	dancing,	and	I	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	strolled	on	up	the	block	past	the	post	office	and	the	creperie,	where	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">smell	 of	 sizzling	 butter	 almost	 drew	 me	 in.	 A	 couple	 was	 looking	 at	 the	 real estate	 listings	 at	 the	 broker’s	 office	 on	 the	 corner,	 and	 I	 found	 myself	 hoping they	 could	 afford	 the	 high	 price	 of	 our	 gorgeous	 town’s	 real	 estate	 because	 we could	 use	 a	 few	 more	 young	 families	 in	 the	 area.	 I	 peeked	 in	 Max	 Davies’s windows	 at	 the	 quaint	 tables	 for	 two	 and	 found	 myself	 actually	 wanting	 to	 eat there,	despite	the	owner’s	bristly	personality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ahead,	 I	 could	 see	 Eleanor	 Heron	 opening	 the	 front	 shutters	 on	 her	 farm stand,	and	that’s	when	I	remembered	–	the	paper	flowers	in	her	windows.	I	tried</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>to	keep	my	pace	steady	as	Mayhem	and	I	walked	over	to	Eleanor,	whose	arms were	full	of	something	that	looked	like	plump	bowling	pins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey	Harvey.	Hey,	Mayhem.”	She	put	her	load	down	in	the	bins	just	inside</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	door	and	bent	down	to	give	the	dog	a	scratch.	“Just	putting	out	the	last	of	my winter	 squash.	 I	 ration	 these	 all	 winter	 so	 I	 have	 produce	 throughout	 the	 cold months.	 Need	 to	 keep	 that	 foot	 traffic	 going,”	 she	 said	 with	 a	 laugh.	 “I	 expect you’ll	know	more	about	that	soon	enough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 expect	 I	 will,”	 I	 said	 with	 a	 smile	 as	 I	 stepped	 over	 to	 the	 leaded	 glass windows.	“Tell	me	about	these	flowers,	Eleanor.	They’re	gorgeous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aren’t	they,	though?	They	sell	them	over	there	at	the	art	co-op,”	she	said	as she	came	and	stood	next	to	me.	“I	bought	these	years	ago	and	just	keep	them	in	a tote	 for	 the	 first	 hint	 of	 spring.	 But	 I	 saw	 they	 had	 some	 there	 again	 this	 year when	I	stopped	by	the	other	day	.	.	.	you	know,	if	you	want	some	for	your	shop.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 gave	 her	 a	 big	 grin.	 “I	 might	 just	 do	 that	 for	 when	 I	 put	 up	 my	 spring picture	 book	 display.”	 I	 took	 a	 step	 toward	 the	 door.	 “I	 know	 you’re	 not technically	 open	 yet,	 but	 would	 you	 mind	 if	 I	 took	 a	 closer	 look,	 see	 what	 I might	be	getting	for	my	money.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure	 thing.”	 Eleanor	 held	 the	 door	 open	 for	 me.	 “I’ll	 just	 be	 in	 the	 back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Have	a	few	cases	of	honey	and	locally	made	mustard	to	put	out.	Those	folks	here for	the	festival	cleaned	me	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tried	to	recall	the	exact	color	of	orange	that	had	been	in	that	corner	of	paper the	sheriff	had	showed	me	as	I	gazed	at	the	intricately-folded	blooms.	Each	one was	a	little	different,	and	they	were	exquisite.	I	could	see	why	the	art	co-op	sold them	–	each	was	a	little	masterpiece	in	and	of	itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	couldn’t	tell,	though,	if	the	oranges	in	some	of	the	paper	were	the	same	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	one	the	sheriff	had,	though.	Hmph.	I	had	hoped	this	would	be	a	good	solid</p>
<p class="calibre1">lead.	Still,	it	was	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks	so	much,	Eleanor,”	I	shouted	as	Mayhem	and	I	headed	for	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	really	are	beautiful.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Call	me	Elle,”	she	said	from	the	back.	“All	my	friends	do.	I’ll	be	up	to	your shop	later.	I	have	a	couple	books	I’d	like	to	order.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See	you	soon	then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a><img src="index-45_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">We	scooted	over	Main	Street	toward	the	art	co-op,	but	a	sign	on	the	door	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 didn’t	 open	 until	 noon,	 and	 I	 needed	 to	 get	 my	 shop	 open	 anyway;	 it	 was almost	ten.	I	made	a	mental	note	to	check	back	later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	DAY	in	the	shop	went	by	lickety-split	between	customers	and	the	usual	book deliveries	for	Tuesday.	Tuesday	is	the	day	most	of	the	new	books	come	out,	so	I made	 a	 lot	 of	 displays	 of	 titles	 that	 I’d	 convinced	 publishers	 would	 sell	 here, even	 in	 a	 new	 store,	 including	 a	 new	 mystery	 novel	 from	 Baltimore’s	 Laura Lippman,	who	was	adored	by	most	Marylanders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 I	 finally	 took	 a	 break	 about	 mid-afternoon	 to	 check	 my	 email,	 I	 was delighted	 to	 see	 a	 note	 from	 my	 friends	 Stephen	 and	 Walter	 back	 in	 San Francisco.	They	were	wondering	if	they	could	come	out	that	weekend	for	a	visit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 didn’t	 even	 take	 me	 a	 second	 to	 send	 back	 a	 yes	 with	 approximately	 thirty exclamation	points	and	the	address.	Oh,	it	would	be	so	good	to	have	them	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’d	wanted	to	come	for	the	grand	opening,	but	Stephen	had	a	big	fundraising event	 with	 our	 old	 organization	 the	 same	 day	 and	 couldn’t	 miss	 it.	 Anyway,	 it was	 kind	 of	 nice	 to	 have	 them	 come	 when	 there	 was	 a	 little	 less	 excitement.	 I could	enjoy	my	time	with	them	more	this	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	also	had	a	note	from	my	parents.	They,	too,	had	missed	the	grand	opening, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	unlike	my	friends,	they	hadn’t	offered	to	come	visit.	They’d	been	down	from Chesapeake	City	once,	not	long	after	Mart	and	I	had	moved	in.	They’d	rented	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">room	at	the	fancy	B&amp;B	in	town,	even	though	we’d	offered	to	let	them	stay	in	our guest	 room,	 and	 when	 they’d	 seen	 the	 shop	 location	 –	 which	 did	 still	 look remarkably	like	a	gas	station	at	that	point	–	they’d	said,	“Oh,	I	hope	you	didn’t pay	too	much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	note	was	typical	Burt	and	Sharon	Beckett.	I	knew	they	wrote	to	feel	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	were	being	good	parents,	checking	in	on	their	daughter	who	now	lived	less than	an	hour	away.	But	they	didn’t	really	open	up	any	space	for	me	to	tell	them how	 I	 actually	 was.	 It	 was	 more	 a	 “thinking	 of	 you”	 because	 we	 know	 we’re supposed	 to	 than	 a	 “How	 are	 you	 really?”	 kind	 of	 a	 note.	 I	 wrote	 back	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>required	 and	 equally	 distant	 response	 to	 thank	 them,	 tell	 them	 I	 was	 fine,	 and note	that	I’d	met	Catherine	Clinton.	A	little	dig	at	my	history-buff	father	and	a note	about	my	own	success,	too.	I	hit	send	with	a	little	zing	down	my	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	would	have	been	easy	to	get	bitter	about	my	parents	–	justified,	too	–	but	I had	decided	a	long	time	ago	that	they	were	who	they	were,	and	that	meant	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	weren’t	going	to	“get”	me.	Somehow,	they	had	raised	a	daughter	who	didn’t value	 the	 things	 they	 did	 –	 notoriety	 and	 financial	 stability	 –	 and	 that disappointed	them.	But	I	liked	who	I	was,	and	now	that	I	was	on	my	own	again</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	a	marriage	that	was	stable	but	broken	in	a	really	fundamental	way,	I	finally was	able	to	live	the	life	I	wanted	to	live.	In	fact,	I’d	signed	my	divorce	papers just	last	week,	so	even	the	pesky	legal	part	was	over.	My	life	was	my	own,	and, even	if	it	disappointed	my	parents,	I	was	going	to	live	it	my	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 last	 email	 in	 my	 inbox	 was	 from	 Max	 Davies.	 I’d	 sent	 him	 a	 note	 the day	before	asking	if	he’d	think	about	creating	a	special	dinner	for	my	Welcome to	 Spring	 dinner,	 and	 to	 my	 surprise	 and	 pleasure,	 he	 thought	 the	 idea	 was wonderful.	“I’ll	come	up	with	a	 <i class="calibre4">Prix	Fixe</i>	menu	and	keep	the	price	reasonable	by asking	my	vendors	to	consider	a	break	for	the	cause.	I	love,	especially,	that	you want	to	donate	to	the	humane	society.	I’d	be	honored	to	be	a	part,	and	so	would Gertrude.	 Thank	 you	 for	 inviting	 us.”	 He	 signed	 off	 with	 a	 picture	 of	 a	 very fluffy,	very	confident	cat,	who	I	could	only	presume	was	Gertrude. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	couldn’t	help	by	smile.	Maybe	Max	wasn’t	so	prickly	after	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 the	 end	 of	 the	 day,	 Rocky	 and	 I	 closed	 up	 shop,	 and	 as	 we	 walked	 out, Rocky	 jerked	 me	 out	 of	 the	 way	 as	 a	 blur	 whizzed	 by.	 “Watch	 where	 you’re going,”	she	shouted,	the	blur	stopped	and	turned	back.	It	was	Marcus	Dawson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry.	Didn’t	see	you,”	he	said	with	a	quick	wave	before	dropping	his	board</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	ground	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	about	what	Lucas	had	told	me	about	him	made	me	want	to	reach</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	 to	 the	 kid,	 so	 before	 he	 could	 skate	 off,	 I	 said,	 “Hey	 Marcus.	 I	 could	 use some	help	around	the	shop	this	week.	Come	by	if	you’d	like	the	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	paused	then	and	turned	to	face	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	 pressure.	 Just	 if	 you	 want	 it.”	 I	 was	 suddenly	 nervous	 that	 I’d overstepped,	offended	him	in	some	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a><img src="index-47_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">He	studied	me	a	second	more	and	then	said,	“See	you	tomorrow.”	Then,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rocky	gave	me	a	small	smile.	“Your	heart	is	so	big,	Harvey.	Just	be	wise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 hugged	 her	 and	 started	 walking	 toward	 home.	 I	 kept	 looking	 around, hopeful.	Maybe	Daniel	was	going	to	come	by	to	walk	me	home	again.	But	as	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">walked,	 I	 felt	 my	 disappointment	 growing.	 Then	 I	 chided	 myself	 for	 being foolish	–	both	for	expecting	him	to	show	and	for	being	so	hopeful	he	would.  <i class="calibre4">He</i> <i class="calibre4">just	said	he	might	come	by</i>,  <i class="calibre4">Harvey.	No	promises. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	time	I	got	home,	I	felt	a	bit	better.	The	walk	through	a	brisk	evening</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	helped,	as	did	the	beauty	of	the	town	with	its	quaint	gardens	and	houses	with golden	 light	 coming	 through	 their	 front	 windows.	 Sometimes,	 I	 felt	 like	 I’d moved	to	the	set	for	a	1950s	sitcom	.	.	.	or	maybe	a	Perry	Mason	episode,	given the	murder	that	had	me	preoccupied.	I	kept	thinking	about	the	shape	of	the	blow to	 Stevensmith’s	 head	 and	 trying	 to	 figure	 out	 what	 someone	 could	 wield	 with enough	 force	 to	 leave	 a	 mark.	 I	 felt	 like	 it	 would	 have	 been	 suspicious	 if	 the murderer	had	been	carrying	a	pipe	around	town,	and	it	was	just	too	much	like	a game	of	 <i class="calibre4">Clue	</i> to	imagine	a	candlestick.	What	would	leave	that	mark?	And	what about	that	piece	of	orange	paper?	I	needed	more	information. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	 NEXT	 MORNING,	 Mart	 came	 with	 me	 to	 the	 shop	 to	 help	 open.	 Rocky	 had classes	on	Wednesday	mornings,	so	Mart	had	arranged	her	work	schedule	so	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 could	 cover	 the	 café	 until	 Rocky	 got	 back	 around	 one.	 Talk	 about	 a	 good friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marcus	showed	up	just	after	we	opened	for	the	day,	and	I	was	impressed.	I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">randomly	shouted	an	offer	for	work	at	him	on	the	street,	and	he’d	still	followed through.	I	liked	a	person	of	their	word.	I	set	him	to	work	cleaning	up	the	weeds behind	 the	 shop.	 I	 felt	 bad	 because	 I	 didn’t	 have	 a	 weed	 eater	 or	 anything,	 but when	 I	 mentioned	 that	 I	 could	 try	 to	 borrow	 one,	 he’d	 said,	 “Nah.	 Sometimes, it’s	better	to	work	with	my	hands	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	liked	this	kid	.	.	.	but	I	kept	thinking	about	how	Lucas	had	said	he	was	kind</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>of	angry.	I	hadn’t	seen	any	signs	of	that,	but	I	was	keeping	my	eye	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Given	 the	 sparse	 number	 of	 shoppers	 first	 thing	 in	 the	 day,	 I	 took	 the opportunity	to	slip	over	to	the	art	co-op	while	Mart	staffed	the	book	register	and café.	 I	 promised	 I	 wouldn’t	 be	 gone	 longer	 than	 a	 half-hour.	 Mayhem	 and	 I buzzed	 up	 the	 street,	 giving	 polite	 nods	 instead	 of	 the	 usual	 stops	 to	 chat,	 and when	 we	 turned	 into	 the	 co-op,	 we	 were	 greeted	 by	 a	 cheerful	 yip	 from Sasquatch.	 I	 looked	 up	 to	 see	 Cate	 behind	 the	 desk,	 a	 phone	 to	 her	 ear.	 She smiled	and	held	up	one	finger.	I	nodded	and	tied	Mayhem	up	beside	Sasquatch</p>
<p class="calibre1">near	the	front	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	Cate	finished	her	call,	I	browsed	the	art	in	the	various	studio	windows</p>
<p class="calibre1">inside.	It	wasn’t	a	big	building	–	a	former	warehouse	of	some	sort,	I	thought	–</p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 I	 counted	 at	 least	 ten	 studios.	 One	 older,	 white	 gentleman	 was	 throwing something	that	looked	to	be	a	very	thin,	very	beautiful	vase	on	a	potter’s	wheel, and	a	young	Latinx	person	stood	at	a	giant	canvas	adding	bright	dashes	of	blue and	turquoise.	A	tiny	white	woman	bent	over	a	table	covered	in	black	velvet,	a jeweler’s	 loupe	 to	 her	 eye,	 and	 a	 tall,	 lean	 black	 woman	 was	 weaving	 at	 the biggest	loom	I’d	ever	seen.	She	saw	me	watching	and	waved	me	over.	I	smiled</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	headed	her	way	just	as	Cate	caught	up	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Henrietta	Johnson	is	one	of	the	finest	weavers	on	the	East	Coast.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 flatter,	 Cate,	 you	 flatter.	 Keep	 it	 up.”	 She	 put	 down	 the	 slim	 piece	 of wood	she’d	been	holding	and	reached	over	to	shake	my	hand.	“I	am	Henrietta, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	everyone	calls	me	Henri.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Henri,	I’m	Harvey.”	I	put	out	my	hand	with	a	grin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Another	woman	with	a	man’s	name.	Your	given	one?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope.	Anastasia	Lovejoy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 word.	 Now	 that’s	 a	 name.	 I’d	 go	 with	 Harvey,	 too.”	 I	 liked	 Henri already. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	leaned	a	bit	closer	to	Henri’s	weaving.	“May	I?”	I	asked	as	I	put	my	hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	the	cloth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	 do.	 And	 thanks	 for	 asking.	 So	 many	 people	 just	 assume	 they	 can touch	things.	It’s	cashmere	from	goats	just	up	the	street.	The	farmer	cleans	it	for me,	and	then	she	spins	it	up	so	I	can	dye	it	and	then	weave	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>“It’s	so	soft.	I	want	to	put	my	face	on	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henri	 laughed.	 “Me,	 too.	 That’s	 why	 I	 make	 a	 lot	 of	 pillows.	 But	 trust	 me, you	 don’t	 want	 to	 sleep	 on	 this	 stuff.	 It’ll	 clog	 up	 your	 sinuses	 like	 nobody’s business.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got	it.”	I	gave	the	weaving	one	last	caress	and	then	smiled.	“	Nice	to	meet</p>
<p class="calibre1">you,	Henri.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You,	 too.	 I’ll	 be	 down	 by	 your	 shop	 later.	 Been	 meaning	 to	 stop	 in.	 Now I’ve	got	a	reason.	It’s	my	turn	to	lay	hands	on	your	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perfect,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cate	tucked	her	arm	in	mine	as	we	headed	back	to	the	front	desk.	“To	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	we	owe	this	pleasure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 I	 was	 hoping	 you	 might	 have	 some	 of	 those	 paper	 flowers	 that Eleanor	has	up	in	her	shop.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	yeah,	this	way.	You	want	some	for	your	shop?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	um,	no.”	I	told	her	about	Sheriff	Mason	and	the	slip	of	paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stopped	in	the	hallway	outside	of	a	small	studio	tucked	at	the	back	of	the co-op	 building.	 “So	 you	 think	 the	 person	 who	 made	 the	 flowers	 murdered Stevensmith?	Wow,	that	would	be	something	considering.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Considering	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Considering	 that	 Divina	 Stevensmith	 is	 the	 one	 who	 makes	 them.”	 She pointed	to	the	name	tag	on	the	door	of	the	studio.	“D.	Stevensmith.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	way.	That’s	too	easy,	isn’t	it?	I	mean,	really.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cate	 shrugged.	 “How	 should	 I	 know?	 I’ve	 never	 tried	 to	 solve	 a	 murder before.”	I	let	out	a	long	sigh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	anything.	Don’t	even	know	that	the	paper	is	from	her	flowers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	just	struck	me	as	a	possibility.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	let’s	see	what	we	can	find	out,	shall	we?”	She	knocked	once	and	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">opened	the	door	of	Divina	Stevensmith’s	studio. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gasped	as	we	walked	in.	The	room	was	a	bright	burst	of	color,	like	confetti</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	suspended	in	time	and	space	around	us.	It	was	beautiful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Divina,	I	think	you	met	Harvey,	the	owner	of	our	very	own	bookstore.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	to	ask	about	your	flowers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>Mrs.	Stevensmith	dropped	off	a	high	stool	behind	the	high	table	where	she’d been	 working	 and	 came	 across	 the	 floor	 to	 meet	 me.	 She	 grinned	 and	 grabbed my	left	hand,	squeezing	it	firmly.	“It’s	good	to	see	you	again,	dear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This,”	I	spun	around	slowly,	“this	is	amazing.	You	did	this?”	I	kept	staring</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 the	 mobiles	 of	 paper	 that	 hung	 from	 every	 level	 of	 the	 ceiling	 and	 made	 a forest	of	color	around	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	did.	This	is	my	mind	writ	large.	All	color	moving	freely	in	space.	I	call	it my	Miasma	of	Beauty.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I	like	that,”	I	said	and	meant	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 studied	 a	 few	 more	 of	 the	 flowers	 hanging	 in	 the	 air	 around	 us	 and	 then moved	past	them	to	pick	up	some	of	the	folded	blooms	attached	to	green	paper</p>
<p class="calibre1">stems	 like	 the	 ones	 I’d	 seen	 at	 Eleanor’s	 farm	 stand.	 “I	 love	 these,	 Mrs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stevensmith.	Do	you	ever	do	them	in	orange?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Orange.	No,	never.	I	hate	that	color.	Vulgar.”	The	tiny	woman’s	voice	rang</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	the	walls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ferocious	shift	in	the	woman’s	tone	caught	me	off-guard,	and	I	shot	Cate</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	quick	glance.	She	gave	her	shoulders	a	little	shrug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	okay.	I	was	going	to	ask	for	a	few	of	them	.	.	.	and	also	see	if	you	might have	 a	 source	 for	 orange	 paper	 for	 something	 I’m	 planning	 at	 the	 shop	 this summer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	thin	woman	turned	her	back	to	me.	“I	do	not.	I	hate	that	color	and	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">never	 have	 a	 thing	 to	 do	 with	 it.	 Never.”	 The	 venom	 in	 her	 words	 made	 them sharp,	and	I	kept	hoping	she’d	turn	around	so	I	could	see	if	she	was	joking.	But she	didn’t.	Instead,	she	began	massacring	pieces	of	thick	paper	with	shiny,	silver scissors.	She	 <i class="calibre4">really</i>	hated	the	color	orange. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	 her	 furious	 paper-cutting	 stopped,	 and	 she	 turned	 halfway	 back</p>
<p class="calibre1">towards	 us.	 “But	 you	 know,	 Max	 Davies	 might	 have	 an	 idea.	 He	 used	 to	 have those	 horrendous	 orange	 menus.	 You	 remember	 them,	 don’t	 you	 dear?”	 She turned	to	face	Cate	then,	and	I	caught	what	I	thought	was	a	glimmer	of	a	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	were	the	color	and	texture	of	orange	peel.	Disgusting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 turned	 to	 Cate.	 “Oh	 yeah,	 he	 did	 have	 orange	 menus,	 I	 guess,	 a	 while back.”	She	gave	me	another	shrug. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a><img src="index-51_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alright.	Well,	I’ll	ask	him	then.	Thanks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Stevensmith	turned	back	to	the	rear	of	her	studio	silently,	and	we	took</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	as	our	not-so-subtle	cue	to	step	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 we	 headed	 back	 to	 the	 desk,	 Cate	 gave	 me	 a	 wink	 and	 said,	 “Divina, always	a	character.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	laughed	.	.	.	but	I	wasn’t	sure	I	found	it	charming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	UNTIED	Mayhem	as	I	left	the	co-op	and	was	just	heading	back	toward	the	shop</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	a	sound	like	a	foghorn	caught	in	a	tunnel	lit	up	the	street	and	I	turned	to see	Taco	baying	for	all	his	worth	across	the	street.	Daniel	was	hurrying	out	of	the hardware	 store	 with	 a	 small,	 white	 bag	 in	 hand,	 and	 I	 could	 hear	 him	 saying, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Taco,	stop	that.	Taco.	Taco!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 Taco	 saw	 his	 person,	 the	 energy	 from	 his	 mouth	 traveled	 right	 down	 to his	 tail,	 and	 I	 saw	 two	 passersby	 wince	 when	 it	 smacked	 them	 in	 the	 legs.	 I couldn’t	help	but	smile	.	.	.	until	Mayhem	started	barking	at	her	friend	and	Taco got	 going	 again.	 Suddenly,	 it	 was	 a	 two-dog	 cacophony	 on	 the	 street,	 and everyone	looked	back	and	forth	from	one	dog	to	the	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 started	 walking	 Mayhem	 down	 the	 street,	 but	 she	 locked	 her	 legs	 straight and	 dug	 in.	 It	 was	 like	 trying	 to	 walk	 a	 stool,	 so	 I	 stopped	 and	 looked	 back	 at Taco.	Daniel	was	staring	back	at	us,	and	I	felt	the	color	rush	to	my	face.	Then,	a smile	broke	across	his	lips,	and	I	smiled	back,	and	soon	we	were	both	doubled</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	 laughing	 while	 our	 dogs	 continued	 to	 bray.	 Eventually,	 he	 got	 enough control	to	hold	up	one	finger	to	signal	me	and	then	get	Taco	to	the	crosswalk	at the	corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	time	the	pair	reached	me,	I	had	almost	regained	my	composure,	well, </p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 least	 about	 the	 spectacle.	 I	 could	 feel	 my	 heart	 racing,	 but	 hopefully,	 Daniel couldn’t	tell.	“Where	you	headed?”	he	asked	as	Mayhem	and	Taco	did	the	usual</p>
<p class="calibre1">meet-and-greet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Back	 to	 the	 shop.	 Treat	 you	 to	 a	 cup	 of	 coffee.”	 I	 grinned	 and	 hoped	 my invitation	sounded	casual. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>“Sounds	 good.	 We	 have	 a	 few	 minutes	 before	 Mrs.	 Fenster	 brings	 in	 her ancient	Mercedes	to	see	if	I	can	keep	it	going	another	100,000	miles.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	cars	even	run	that	long?”	I	had	to	admit	I	didn’t	even	know	the	mileage</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	my	car	right	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	do	if	they’re	good	cars	and	cared	for	well.	Mrs.	Fenster	is	at	300,000</p>
<p class="calibre1">miles	and	counting.”	He	gave	me	a	wry	smile.	“And	that’s	nearly	a	miracle	since she	only	drives	from	her	house	about	two	miles	outside	town	to	the	grocery	store and	hair	salon	here,”	he	pointed	up	the	street	a	bit,	“once	a	week.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?	Has	she	owned	the	car	for	ninety	years?”	I	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Almost.	I’m	pretty	sure	she’s	a	vampire.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	were	both	still	laughing	when	we	opened	the	door	to	the	bookstore	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">walked	 straight	 into	 Walter	 and	 Stephen,	 my	 two	 friends	 from	 San	 Francisco. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Surprise,”	Stephen	said	as	he	hugged	me	and	whispered,	“I	see	you’ve	made	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">friend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 pulled	 back	 and	 gave	 Stephen	 a	 look	 that	 I	 hoped	 said,	 “I’m	 glad	 you’re here,	but	don’t	embarrass	me.”	Then,	I	hugged	Walter	and	said,	“What	are	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">two	doing	here?	I	thought	you	weren’t	coming	until	the	weekend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	couldn’t	wait,”	Stephen	said	as	he	gestured	around	the	store.	“We	had	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	this	place.	Plus,	I	missed	you.	You	look	good.	Really	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 grinned.	 Stephen	 had	 been	 my	 closest	 friend	 at	 work	 back	 on	 the	 West Coast,	and	his	husband,	Walter,	had	become	a	friend,	too.	I	was	giddy	that	they were	 here.	 “Stephen,	 Walter,	 this	 is	 Daniel.	 He’s	 the	 town’s	 wizard	 of	 a mechanic.	We	were	just	going	to	grab	some	coffee.	Join	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	both	desperately	wanted	to	sit	down	with	my	friends	and	catch	up	and	to	sit</p>
<p class="calibre1">alone	with	Daniel	and	enjoy	that	cup	of	coffee.	Behind	Walter’s	head,	I	could	see Rocky	 grinning	 and	 realized	 that	 Daniel	 and	 I	 weren’t	 going	 to	 have	 a	 quiet moment	no	matter	what.	I	threw	him	a	glance,	“You	okay	if	they	join	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	 course,”	 he	 said	 as	 he	 bent	 down	 to	 let	 Mayhem	 and	 Taco	 off	 their leashes	so	that	they	could	rush	into	the	waiting	arms	of	the	two	men	who	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">far	 too	 excited	 to	 see	 them.	 Stephen	 and	 Walter	 were	 dog	 people,	 and	 these hounds	knew	it.	The	amount	of	squealing	and	wagging	was	extremely	mutual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually,	 the	 pups	 took	 off	 to	 sniff	 and	 nap,	 and	 we	 headed	 into	 the	 café</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>where	Rocky	had	already	prepared	a	large	French	press	of	coffee	and	put	it	with what	had	to	be	a	secret	stash	of	her	mom’s	cinnamon	rolls	–	they	had	certainly been	secret	from	me	–	on	the	larger	table	near	the	front	window.	She	gave	me	a wink	as	she	headed	back	to	the	counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	that,	my	friends,	is	the	extraordinary	Rocky	Chevalier.	My	right-hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman	and	daughter	of	the	best	baker	in	town.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walter	lifted	a	half-eaten	cinnamon	roll	and	said,	“To	Rocky	and	her	mom” </p>
<p class="calibre1">through	a	mouthful	of	bread. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	all	joined	suit,	“To	Rocky	and	her	mom,”	and	raised	our	cinnamon	rolls</p>
<p class="calibre1">high.	I	caught	a	glimpse	of	a	customer	or	two	headed	into	the	café	then	leaving with	 to-go	 containers	 holding	 Rocky’s	 mom’s	 delights.	 The	 cinnamon	 rolls spoke	for	themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	what	are	you	two	doing	here?”	I	asked	after	taking	a	huge	swig	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">perfectly	strong	coffee.	“I	don’t	even	have	your	bed	made	yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	 goodness,	 woman.	 Don’t	 worry	 about	 that.	 The	 real	 concern	 is	 if	 you have	enough	snacks	for	our	Friday	night	movie	binge.	We	have	 <i class="calibre4">Get	Out	</i> and	 <i class="calibre4">Us</i> to	watch,	you	know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	laughed.	“The	house	is	always	stocked	with	Cheese	Doodles,	Peanut	Butter</p>
<p class="calibre1">M&amp;Ms,	and	mini	Kit	Kats.	Anything	else	is	available	at	our	local	Food	Lion.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Peanut	Butter	M&amp;Ms,	huh?	I’m	in,”	Daniel	grinned.	I	felt	Stephen	kick	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">under	the	table	just	before	the	color	flushed	my	cheeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	more	the	merrier,”	Stephen	said	as	he	winked	at	me.	“I’m	always	happy</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	invite	people	over	to	other	people’s	homes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	in	that	case,”	Rocky	chimed	in	from	the	counter,	“Count	me	in,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those	movies	terrified	me,	and	it	was	awesome.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks	like	we	have	a	plan	for	Friday	night	then,”	I	said	as	I	stole	a	glance	at Daniel.	He	was	looking	right	at	me	and	smiling.	I	blushed	again	and	then	looked away	quickly.	“But	really,	why	are	you	guys	here	early?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mart	 told	 us	 the	 grand	 opening	 was	 amazing,	 and	 we	 had	 some	 extra vacation	 time	 stored	 up.	 We	 couldn’t	 imagine	 a	 better	 way	 to	 spend	 it	 than seeing	 our	 favorite	 bookshop	 owner	 and	 being	 by	 the	 brackish	 waters	 of	 the Chesapeake	Bay.”	Stephen	squeezed	my	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>“Don’t	let	him	fool	you.	He	had	to	look	up	the	body	of	water	and	the	word <i class="calibre4">brackish</i>	 on	 the	 plane.”	 Walter	 slipped	 his	 arm	 around	 his	 husband’s	 shoulder and	tugged.	“Mostly,	he	just	wanted	to	see	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 felt	 tears	 leap	 to	 my	 eyes.	 “I’m	 so	 glad	 you’re	 here.”	 I	 grabbed	 Walter’s hand,	too,	and	squeezed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 all	 sat	 quietly	 for	 a	 few	 minutes	 sipping	 our	 coffee,	 or	 in	 my	 case, refilling	my	mug,	Then,	Walter	said,	“So	you’re	the	town	mechanic?	I	hope	it’s not	insulting	to	say	that	I	find	that	quaint	in	the	best	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	laughed.	“Not	insulting	at	all.	A	lot	of	things	here	in	St.	Marin’s	are pretty	 quaint.	 Of	 course,	 quaint	 can	 also	 be	 a	 synonym	 for	 claustrophobic,	 but mostly,	it’s	just	nice.	I	grew	up	in	a	big	city,	so	I	love	knowing	my	neighbors	and their	pets.	It	makes	me	feel	at	home,	I	guess.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	grew	up	in	a	big	city?”	I	was	surprised,	but	I	didn’t	know	why.	I	knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing	 about	 this	 man,	 and	 despite	 popular	 belief	 held	 by	 a	 lot	 of	 urban dwellers,	you	can’t	spot	a	country	person	by	the	hay	sticking	out	of	their	mouth or	the	gun	rack	in	their	pick-up	truck.	Daniel	just	seemed	like	he	fit	so	well	here, and	he	knew	everyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep.	Chicago.	But	it	wasn’t	for	me.	Too	fast.	Too	many	people.	Too	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">traffic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’d	 think	 that	 lots	 of	 cars	 would	 be	 good	 for	 a	 mechanic?”	 Stephen quipped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 would.	 But	 not	 for	 me.	 I	 like	 knowing	 the	 people	 who	 come	 to	 my shop.	After	all,	a	car	is	like	a	family	member.	It	needs	to	be	cared	for	well	and regularly.	A	lot	of	folks	in	Chicago	who	drive	are	commuters,	so	they	take	their cars	to	garages	in	the	suburbs.	I	knew	I	needed	a	smaller	place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Makes	sense,”	I	said.	“But	why	St.	Marin’s?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would	 you	 believe	 I	 was	 sailing	 around	 the	 world	 after	 high	 school	 and ended	up	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	way.”	I	tried	to	keep	my	mouth	from	hanging	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 I	 didn’t	 say	 I	 did	 that,	 just	 asked	 if	 you’d	 believe	 I	 did.	 I	 have	 my answer.”	He	bumped	my	arm	with	his	elbow.	“Did	you	know	that	 <i class="calibre4">gullible</i>	 isn’t in	the	dictionary?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>I	bumped	him	back	and	hung	my	head	with	embarrassment.	I	couldn’t	help smiling	though.	This	guy	was	funny.	Stephen	kicked	me	under	the	table	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually,	I	came	this	way	to	go	to	Salisbury	on	a	baseball	scholarship,	but	it turns	out	that	college	isn’t	really	for	me.	I’m	much	more	of	a	hands-on	guy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	then,	Marcus	came	in	from	the	back	of	the	store.	I	had	totally	forgotten</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	was	here,	and	from	the	looks	of	him,	he’d	worked	straight	through	lunch	and everything.	“College	wasn’t	really	for	me	either,”	he	said	as	I	handed	him	a	tall glass	of	ice	water.	“The	dorms	were	what	got	to	me	.	.	.	another	person	I	don’t know	all	up	in	my	stuff?	Nah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 laughed.	 “Yeah,	 I	 had	 this	 one	 roommate.	 She’d	 go	 to	 bed	 every	 night	 at eight	and	play	some	sort	of	flute	music	for	hours	at	full	blast.	If	I	never	hear	a flute	again,	it’ll	be	too	soon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marcus	laughed.	“So,	Ms.	Beckett,	we’re	all	set.	I	cleaned	up	all	the	weeds</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	picked	up	a	bunch	of	trash,	too.	I	left	a	couple	of	piles	by	the	corner	of	the building,	but	if	you’ll	tell	me	where	you	want	them,	I’ll—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Marcus,	 you	 have	 done	 more	 than	 enough.”	 I	 headed	 toward	 the	 register. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	me	pay	you,	and	you	can	go	get	a	shower	and	head	out	for	the	rest	of	your day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 saw	 him	 wince,	 but	 chalked	 it	 up	 to	 the	 aches	 and	 pains	 of	 hard	 labor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,	Mrs.	Beckett.	I	appreciate	it.”	He	waved	at	everyone	and	then	took	his skateboard	out	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nice	kid,”	Stephen	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hard	worker,	too.	I	hope	I	can	give	him	more	work	soon.	It’s	hard	to	find	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">job	these	days	without	a	college	degree.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep,	 even	 back	 in	 my	 day	 –	 back	 in	 the	 dark	 ages	 –	 it	 was	 hard,”	 Walter said.	“I	fought	my	way	through	college,	but	I	hated	it.	It	was	just	really	not	ideal for	 me,	 and	 I	 don’t	 remember	 anything	 from	 any	 of	 my	 classes.	 Put	 me	 on	 a construction	site,	though,	and	I	am	in	my	element.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 work	 construction	 then?”	 Daniel	 asked,	 and	 I	 applauded	 his	 sincerity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walter	was	tall,	lean,	very	well	dressed,	and	had	hands	soft	as	a	baby’s	bottom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	did	not	look	like	the	stereotype	of	a	construction	worker	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	did.	For	about	fifteen	years.	Steel	worker.	But	then,	they	figured	out	I	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>good	with	planning	and	people,	so	I	moved	into	management.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Walter	 is	 being	 modest.	 He	 owns	 one	 of	 the	 biggest	 commercial</p>
<p class="calibre1">construction	companies	in	California.”	I	loved	bragging	about	my	friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 amazing,”	 Daniel	 said	 with	 a	 huge	 smile.	 “There’s	 nothing	 like	 the freedom	–	and	the	stress	–	of	owning	your	own	business.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	it,”	Walter	smiled	at	Daniel,	and	then	I	felt	his	foot	nudge	mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anymore	footsie	under	this	table,	and	we’d	need	a	soccer	ball. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you	know	what	we	need	to	know,	right?	Tell	us	about	this	person	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	killed	here.	Are	you	okay?”	Stephen	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 had	 almost	 forgotten	 about	 Stevensmith’s	 murder.	 Between	 my	 ever-</p>
<p class="calibre1">growing	 crush	 on	 Daniel	 and	 the	 arrival	 of	 my	 two	 friends,	 I	 had	 been	 totally distracted	for	thirty	minutes.	Remembering	felt	like	a	huge	thud	in	my	day.	Still, pretending	it	hadn’t	happened	wouldn’t	make	the	fact	disappear,	so	I	caught	my friends	 up	 all	 the	 way	 through	 the	 orange	 piece	 of	 paper	 and	 Divina Stevensmith’s	strange	and	emphatic	feelings	about	the	color	orange. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	so,”	Stephen	gave	Walter	a	look.	“She’s	sleuthing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tried	to	avoid	eye	contact,	but	Stephen	grabbed	my	chin	and	turned	my	face</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward	him.	“You	can’t	help	it,	can	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	just	asking	a	few	questions.	Nothing	major.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	Sheriff	Mason	was	investigating	pretty	seriously.”	Daniel’s	voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">sounded	concerned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	he	is.	He	is.	I	guess	I’m	just	curious	by	nature.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Better	 than	 naughty,”	 Walter	 said	 almost	 under	 his	 breath	 before	 his	 eyes got	wide.	“Oh	my	goodness,	did	I	say	that	out	loud?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 blushed	 for	 the	 kabillionth	 time	 this	 morning.	 “Anyway.	 No	 big	 deal.	 I haven’t	found	anything	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	not	yet,	but	we	do	need	to	talk	to	Max	Davies	pronto.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	stood	up	and	put	his	hand	on	my	shoulder.	“Be	careful,	Harvey,	okay? </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 town	 is	 small.	 People	 will	 know	 if	 you’re	 asking	 questions.	 There	 are	 no secrets,	remember.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 liked	 the	 feel	 of	 his	 hand	 on	 my	 shoulder	 so	 much	 that	 I	 almost	 missed what	he	said,	but	then,	I	nodded.	“I	will.	I	think	I’m	being	pretty	discreet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>Stephen	 and	 Walter	 exchanged	 a	 look.	 “You	 are	 amazing.	 Kind.	 Generous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Easy-going.	 But	  <i class="calibre4">discreet</i>	 you	 are	 not,”	 Stephen	 said.	 “Listen	 to	 the	 man.	 He knows	this	town	better	than	you	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stood	up,	too,	sad	to	feel	Daniel’s	hand	fall	away.	“Okay,	okay.	I’ll	watch</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,”	all	three	men	said	at	once.	I	laughed.	“Thanks,	men.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alright,	 where’s	 your	 spare	 key?	 We	 took	 a	 red-eye,	 and	 despite	 this amazing	 coffee	 –	 thank	 you,	 Rocky!	 –	 I	 need	 a	 nap	 big	 time.”	 Stephen	 put	 his arm	around	my	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	catch	up	with	you	later,	Harvey.	Maybe	come	by	when	the	shop	closes</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	to	walk	you	home.”	Daniel	said	as	he	stood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	you	don’t—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	perfect.	You	can	just	walk	Harvey	home	if	that	suits,”	Walter	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tried	to	keep	my	eyes	in	my	head	as	my	friends	told	someone	they	barely</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew	what	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 are	 going	 to	 be	 cooking	 a	 fine	 dinner,	 so	 join	 us	 tonight,”	 Walter continued.	“I	hear	the	seafood	is	amazing	here.”	He	looked	at	me.	“Don’t	worry, Miss	‘I	Hate	Seafood,’	I	have	an	amazing	gourmet	burger	in	mind	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sounds	 good	 to	 me.”	 Daniel	 whistled	 and	 Taco	 came	 running.	 Well, </p>
<p class="calibre1">galumphing	might	be	a	more	accurate	description.	“I’ll	see	you	soon,	Harvey.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bell	rang,	and	the	man	and	his	dog	slipped	out	the	front	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harvey!	 That	 man	 likes	 you.”	 Stephen	 was	 anything	 but	 quiet,	 and	 I	 was pleased,	for	once,	that	we	didn’t	have	any	customers	in	the	shop	at	the	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	from	the	flush	on	your	cheeks,	I’d	say	you	like	him	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Love	is	in	the	air,”	Walter	chimed	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	two	need	to	stop.	I	barely	know	the	man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Since	 when	 did	 that	 matter?	 I	 knew	 I	 wanted	 to	 marry	 Walter	 on	 our	 first date.	And	we	were	engaged	in	three	months.	When	you	know,	you	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	don’t	know	anything,	so	you	two	go	on	and	get	a	nap.	I’m	looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward	to	my	burger.”	I	took	each	man	by	an	arm	and	walked	them	to	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 so	 glad	 you’re	 here,	 guys.	 Really.	 You’ve	 made	 my	 week.	 Thank	 you	 for coming.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>“We	 wouldn’t	 have	 missed	 it.	 A	 friend,	 a	 murder,	 and	 a	 little	 romance.	 It’s like	a	movie	right	here	in	this	little	shop.”	Stephen	gave	me	a	kiss	on	the	cheek and	then	they	headed	to	my	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 headed	 to	 the	 counter,	 sat	 down,	 and	 put	 my	 face	 on	 the	 cool	 wood.	 Two evenings	with	Daniel	in	one	week.	I	couldn’t	stop	smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a><b class="calibre3">6</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	rest	of	the	afternoon	went	by	uneventfully.	A	steady	stream	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">customers,	 including	 a	 mom	 of	 a	 young	 boy	 who	 wanted	 books	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">taught	 him	 to	 be	 compassionate.	 I	 could	 have	 spent	 all	 afternoon</p>
<p class="calibre1">recommending	titles	to	her,	but	when	she	settled	on	 <i class="calibre4">The	Quiltmaker’s	Gift</i>,	 one of	 my	 favorites,	 I	 was	 delighted.	 The	 illustrations	 alone	 made	 that	 book	 worth owning.	But	the	story	was	sweet	and	generous,	too.	I	thought	her	son	would	love it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	exactly	seven,	Rocky	and	I	turned	off	the	lights	and	headed	out	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	past	few	days,	I’d	developed	the	habit	of	double-checking	the	alarmed	bar I’d	 had	 installed	 on	 the	 back	 door	 after	 Stevensmith’s	 murder,	 and	 tonight,	 I triple-checked	it.	I	didn’t	want	anything	–	especially	a	break-in	–	to	interrupt	our dinner	tonight.	I	tried	to	tell	myself	that	it	was	because	my	friends	were	in	town, but	 mostly,	 it	 was	 a	 certain	 dark-haired	 man	 and	 his	 Basset	 Hound	 I	 could	 see waiting	on	the	sidewalk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	 and	 I	 strolled	 in	 silence	 for	 a	 couple	 of	 blocks,	 and	 I	 noted	 how comfortable	 I	 felt.	 Again.	 This	 felt	 too	 easy,	 but	 maybe	 that	 was	 the	 way	 of things	 that	 were	 actually	 mutual.	 I	 hadn’t	 had	 much	 luck	 with	 that	 in	 my marriage,	so	I	wouldn’t	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 we	 turned	 off	 Main	 Street,	 Daniel	 said,	 “So,	 Walter	 and	 Stephen,	 I	 like them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	grinned.	“I	like	them,	too.	They’re	good	people,	and	they’ve	been	amazing</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>friends	 to	 me.”	 While	 we	 walked	 the	 last	 few	 blocks	 to	 my	 house,	 I	 told	 him about	 the	 time	 Walter	 had	 come	 to	 pick	 me	 up	 when	 my	 tire	 had	 blown	 in	 an Oakland	 parking	 lot	 at	 about	 two	 a.m.	 My	 ex-husband	 hadn’t	 answered	 his phone,	and	I	was	at	a	loss.	The	other	people	who	had	attended	the	concert	with me	 were	 leaving	 steadily,	 and	 I	 was	 getting	 more	 and	 more	 nervous	 waiting	 in the	lot	for	a	taxi.	But	then,	Walter,	after	getting	a	text	from	Stephen	who	was	in Seattle	but	who	I’d	texted	just	for	company	while	I	waited	for	my	cab,	rolled	up and	got	me.	He	drove	me	home,	making	jokes	all	the	way.	I	felt	embarrassed,	but I	also	felt	so	grateful.	“They	really	are	amazing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	tell,”	Daniel	said	as	we	walked	up	to	my	house.	All	the	lights	were	on, and	 I	 could	 see	 Mart	 dancing	 by	 the	 kitchen	 island.	 It	 was	 going	 to	 be	 a	 good night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sure	 enough,	 when	 we	 opened	 the	 door,	 a	 puff	 of	 warm,	 garlic-scented	 air engulfed	 us,	 and	 the	 sounds	 of	 Little	 Big	 Town	 spilled	 out.	 Neither	 Mart	 nor	 I were	 country	 music	 fans,	 but	 there	 was	 just	 something	 about	 that	 group’s harmonies	 that	 made	 us	 happy.	 Apparently,	 Walter	 and	 Stephen	 felt	 the	 same way	because	when	I	turned	the	corner	from	the	foyer	into	the	kitchen,	they	were both	singing	into	wooden	spoons	.	.	.	and	they	weren’t	bad	either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nice	 harmony,	 guys,”	 I	 said	 as	 I	 draped	 the	 scarf	 Mart	 had	 crocheted	 me during	 her	 “yarn	 phase”	 of	 2016.	 That	 year,	 she	 had	 made	 everyone	 we	 knew scarves	and	had	gotten	strangely	invested	in	Maggie	Sefton’s	knitting	mysteries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	even	made	me	take	a	road	trip	to	Fort	Collins	so	we	could	visit	the	town	that the	books	were	set	in.	When	she	saw	the	yarn	shop	that	inspired	the	theme	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	books,	she	had	teared	up.	It	was	a	tender	year	for	both	of	us.	I	was	happy	that 2017	was	the	year	of	baked	goods	and	thrillers.	It	made	for	a	little	less	wool	and a	few	more	scary	movies	accompanied	by	macaroons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Daniel,	glad	you’re	here,”	Walter	said	as	he	headed	toward	my	fridge.	“Beer</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	wine?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Beer,	please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	got	it.	Light	or	dark?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Light.”	Walter	popped	the	cap	off	a	Corona	and	handed	it	to	Daniel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	made	my	way	to	the	fridge	and	opened	it	up.	When	I’d	left	that	morning, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>we’d	had	half	a	loaf	of	bread,	some	really	good	gouda,	leftover	boxed	mac	and cheese,	 and	 eighteen	 jars	 of	 pickles.	 Now,	 the	 fridge	 was	 jammed	 with	 fresh herbs	 in	 glasses	 of	 water,	 a	 whole	 shelf	 of	 fresh	 produce,	 and	 more	 wine	 and beer	than	I	could	count.	The	guys	had	been	shopping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	poured	a	glass	of	Chateau	St.	Jean	Chardonnay	and	turned	to	Stephen.	“You</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembered.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	could	I	forget?	You	gush	about	that	place	all	the	time.	Plus,	it	has	that quirky	 name	 that	 seems	 French	 but	 is	 really	 just	 super-American.	 Chateau	 St. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jean,”	he	looked	at	Daniel,	“like	denim	or	genetics,	not	the	French	man’s	name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weird,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Definitely	weird.”	Daniel	winked	at	me	as	he	took	a	sip	of	his	beer,	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt	my	knees	give	a	little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	 gave	 me	 the	 signal	 –	 meaning,	 she	 grabbed	 my	 hand	 and	 dragged	 me into	my	bedroom	–	and	said,	“Daniel	is	here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tried	to	play	it	cool.	“Yes,	I	know.	I	brought	him.”	But	then,	I	broke	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	giggled.	“I	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	 okay.	 We’re	 so	 cool.”	 She	 let	 out	 a	 long	 breath.	 “And	 he	 winked	 at you.”	 She	 giggled	 this	 time.	 “Okay,	 cool,	 cool.”	 She	 grabbed	 my	 hand	 and dragged	me	back.	We	were	anything	but	subtle	in	our	silliness,	but	none	of	the guys	seemed	to	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayhem	and	Taco	had	passed	out	on	the	rug	by	the	fireplace,	and	Aslan	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">tentatively	getting	comfy	on	the	chair	near	the	heat	but	not	too	near	the	dogs.	It was	 clear	 that	 she	 resented	 the	 dogs	 taking	  <i class="calibre4">her	 </i> space,	 but	 her	 sense	 of	 self-preservation	kept	her	near	her	escape	route,	the	bookshelf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon,	Walter	and	Stephen	served	us	the	most	glorious-smelling	seafood	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	burger	so	big	that	I	needed	two	hands	to	hold	it,	and	we	all	tucked	in.	The	food was	amazing,	and	I	kept	looking	around	the	table	with	sheer	delight.	These	were my	people,	and	they	were	here	for	me.	Even	Daniel	.	.	.	or	at	least	I	hoped	Daniel was	going	to	be	one	of	my	people.	I	tried	not	to	think	 <i class="calibre4">my	person</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	all	finished	up	our	meals	and	I	considered	undoing	the	button	on	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">jeans,	Mart	smacked	a	hand	on	the	table	and	said,	“I	totally	forgot	to	tell	you,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 looked	 at	 me,	 “but	 I	 stopped	 at	 the	 farmer’s	 market	 today	 to	 see	 Eleanor</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>about	some	centerpieces	for	our	big	gala	in	a	couple	of	weeks.	And	as	I	walked in,	 the	 sheriff	 was	 leaving.	 Eleanor	 looked	 like	 death	 warmed	 over.	 Her	 hands were	shaking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	my	goodness.	Did	she	say	what	happened?”	I	leaned	forward,	my	hands</p>
<p class="calibre1">gripping	 the	 table	 edge.	 My	 mind	 had	 immediately	 gone	 to	 that	 little	 corner	 of paper	and	the	origami	flowers	Eleanor	had	in	the	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	didn’t	give	me	all	the	details	–	I	think	she	was	embarrassed	–	but	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	 Sheriff	 Mason	 had	 been	 asking	 her	 questions	 about	 Stevensmith	 and	 her death.	I	got	the	impression	she	had	just	been	questioned,	maybe	as	a	suspect.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walter	said,	“Ooh,	now	this	is	getting	good.	Is	she	a	suspect?”	He	looked	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Part	of	me	wanted	to	say,	“How	should	I	know?”	but	the	honest	part	of	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">nodded.	“I	think	maybe	she	is.”	I	told	them	about	the	flowers	in	the	window	of her	shop,	and	a	tiny	glimmer	of	something	important	passed	behind	my	eyes	too</p>
<p class="calibre1">quickly	for	me	to	catch	it.	I	made	a	mental	note	to	come	back	to	that	idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	 now	 we	 have	 three	 suspects?	 Max	 Davies,	 Divina	 Stevensmith,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eleanor	 Heron,”	 Mart	 said	 with	 a	 bit	 of	 mischief	 in	 her	 tone.	 “The	 plot thickens.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 caught	 Stephen	 and	 Daniel	 exchanging	 a	 worried	 look	 and	 didn’t	 know whether	to	be	put	out	or	pleased	that	everyone	was	bonding	so	well.	“What?!”	I said	to	the	pair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	saw	a	little	pink	moved	into	Daniel’s	cheeks	as	he	avoided	looking	me	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 eye.	 Stephen	 couldn’t	 get	 off	 so	 easy	 though	 as	 I	 grabbed	 his	 cheeks	 and made	him	look	at	me,	just	as	he’d	done	to	me	in	the	café	earlier.	“What?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	last	time	you	snooped	into	a	murder	.	.	.	” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait,	what	happened	last	time?	There	was	a	last	time?”	Daniel	looked	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	to	Stephen	and	back	to	me	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	let	out	a	hard	sigh.	“Yes,	and	it	all	ended	fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“True.	But	you	almost	died.”	Stephen	could	not	keep	his	mouth	shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	may	be	a	bit	of	an	exaggeration.	But	anyway,	that’s	another	story	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	 time.”	 I	 was	 desperate	 to	 avoid	 any	 talk	 of	 my	 life	 back	 in	 San Francisco.	Too	much	baggage	there	to	foist	on	a	guy	I	could	really	like.	I	didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a>want	 to	 scare	 him	 off.	 “We	 have	 a	 murder	 here,	 now,	 and	 it	 happened	 in	 my store.	That	makes	it	personal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	there’s	a	question,”	Walter	said	as	he	got	up	to	grab	the	pot	of	decaf</p>
<p class="calibre1">coffee.	“Do	you	think	the	person	planned	the	murder	for	your	store?	“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	definitely	not.	Stevensmith	wasn’t	hit	in	my	store.	She	just	came	to	hide there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stephen	 took	 a	 long	 sip	 of	 his	 scalding	 hot	 coffee	 and	 asked,	 “But	 did	 she come	to	die	in	your	store	on	purpose?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shuddered.	“I	certainly	hope	not.”	I	looked	down	at	the	hand-thrown	coffee</p>
<p class="calibre1">mug	 that	 I’d	 picked	 up	 in	 a	 little	 pottery	 studio	 when	 Mart	 and	 I	 had	 taken	 a weekend	 trip	 to	 the	 Shenandoah	 National	 Park	 over	 the	 winter.	 “But	 I	 hadn’t thought	of	that.	Is	that	possible?	Can	someone	with	a	serious	head	injury	think that	clearly	to	pick	a	specific	place	to	die?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	 put	 his	 hand	 over	 mine,	 and	 I	 felt	 all	 the	 blood	 rush	 to	 my	 face.	 It didn’t	help	that	Mart,	Walter,	and	Stephen	all	kicked	my	leg	at	the	same	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	expect	she	just	happened	to	be	close	by,	saw	the	back	door,	and	hid	anywhere she	could.	She	probably	didn’t	even	know	where	she	was.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	resisted	the	urge	to	pull	my	hand	away	from	Daniel’s.	I	loved	the	feel	of	it there,	but	I	didn’t	love	the	way	my	friends	were	ogling	our	hands.	I	stayed	still and	 smiled	 at	 him.	 “Thanks.	 I	 expect	 you’re	 right.”	 I	 gave	 his	 fingers	 a	 little squeeze	and	then	slid	my	hand	into	my	lap.	“That	does	beg	the	question,	though. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where	did	she	get	attacked?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	 was	 up	 before	 I	 finished	 my	 exhale	 following	 my	 question.	 “Let’s	 go find	out,”	she	said	as	she	handed	me	my	scarf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	 I	 looked	 down	 at	 the	 blue	 knitted	 band	 and	 back	 at	 my	 friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?!	No.	We	aren’t	going	to	try	to	find	where	the	murder	happened.	Not	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">nine	o’clock	at	night.	No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	could	see	that	Walter	had	already	slid	on	his	leather	bomber	jacket,	and Stephen	 was	 easing	 his	 chair	 back	 from	 the	 table.	 Only	 Daniel	 and	 I	 were	 still sitting	there,	and	even	he	looked	like	he	wanted	to	get	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	see	I	have	no	say	here.	Alright,	let’s	go.”	I	wrapped	the	scarf	around	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">neck	and	pulled	on	my	peacoat.	We	gave	Mayhem	and	Taco	the	hamburger	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a><img src="index-64_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Stephen	and	Walter	had	cooked	just	for	them	and	headed	toward	the	door.	I	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">bringing	up	the	rear	so	I	could	lock	the	door	behind	us,	but	Daniel	lingered	back and	turned	to	me	just	as	I	reached	the	door</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	in	for	whatever	adventure	this	is,	but	I	want	you	to	be	careful,	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyes	were	soft,	and	the	gentleness	of	his	voice	almost	brought	me	to	tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.	I	will.”	I	smiled.	“I’m	glad	you’re	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	he	took	my	hand	and	squeezed	as	we	went	out	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	NIGHT	WAS	crisp	and	clear.	In	our	part	of	town,	the	streetlights	were	few	and far	between,	so	we	could	see	thousands	of	stars	overhead.	The	cold	air	and	the starshine	made	us	all	a	little	playful	as	we	skipped	and	laughed	our	way	back	to Main	 Street.	 Daniel	 and	 I	 opened	 the	 front	 door	 and	 disarmed	 the	 alarm	 at	 the back	of	the	shop	while	Stephen,	Walter,	and	Mart	headed	around	back	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">outside	 to	 take	 a	 look	 at	 the	 parking	 lot.	 We	 were	 just	 about	 through	 the	 store when	I	heard	Mart	exclaim,	“Oh	no.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	ran	the	last	few	steps	only	to	find	the	back	door	wide	open,	the	security	bar popped	free	from	the	door	jamb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Holy	crap,”	Walter	said.	“It	looks	like	a	bear	tried	to	take	your	door	off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	knelt	down	and	looked	closely	at	the	door	jamb.	“Only	if	a	bear	uses</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	crow	bar.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	crow	bar?”	I	knelt	down	and	looked.	Sure	enough,	there	were	scraps	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">dents	in	the	metal	door	frame.	Someone	had	pried	the	door	open	and	forced	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">security	bar	loose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Clearly,	 someone	 desperately	 needed	 a	 copy	 of	 John	 Grisham’s	 new	 book immediately,”	 Stephen	 said	 wryly.	 Then,	 he	 looked	 at	 me	 and	 said,	 “You	 have insurance.	It’ll	cover	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 nodded.	 “It	 will,	 but	 why	 would	 someone	 break	 into	 my	 bookstore?	 And why	didn’t	the	alarm	go	off?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	an	easy	one,”	Mart	said,	holding	up	some	wires	that	had	been	pulled</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	of	a	box	on	the	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a>“Seriously?	The	alarm	company	put	the	junction	box	for	your	system	on	the outside	of	the	building?”	Daniel	sounded	angry.	“Tomorrow,	I’ll	talk	with	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tonight,	let’s	just	get	this	secure	and	call	the	sheriff.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	couldn’t	help	but	smile	when	he	looked	at	me	and	said,	“I	mean,	if	that’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">okay	with	you,	Harvey.	It’s	your	shop.	This	just	makes	me	so	mad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	that’s	a	good	plan.	But	while	we’re	back	here,	we	might	as	well	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	we	came	to	do.”	I	tried	to	sound	confident	because	I	really	did	want	to	look around,	but	I	could	feel	my	heart	at	the	back	of	my	throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stephen	acted	as	if	he	was	holding	a	magnifying	glass	up	to	his	eye.	“I’m	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	hunt	for	clues.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	you	guys	look	around.	I’ll	go	inside	and	call	the	sheriff.”	I	started	for the	door,	but	Walter	grabbed	my	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	 you	 should	 stay	 out	 here.	 We	 don’t	 know	 that	 whoever	 did	 this	 is gone.”	Walter	said	as	he	handed	me	his	cell	phone.	I	made	the	call,	and	then	we all	stood	close	together	in	the	back	parking	lot	until	Sheriff	Mason	arrived	in	a cruiser	with	Deputy	Williams	in	another	car	close	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 told	 him	 what	 we’d	 found,	 and	 the	 deputy	 took	 some	 photos	 and	 then dusted	for	prints.	Meanwhile,	the	sheriff	took	us	all	inside	and	had	me	look	for anything	 that	 was	 missing.	 “I	 know	 you	 may	 not	 notice	 if	 a	 particular	 book	 is gone—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	interrupted	him.	“Oh,	Harvey	will	notice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 nodded.	 “I	 straighten	 the	 shelves	 every	 night.	 I	 should	 be	 able	 to	 see	 any gaps.”	 I	 took	 a	 quick	 lap	 around	 the	 small	 shop,	 but	 I	 didn’t	 notice	 any	 books missing.	I	was	just	heading	back	to	the	café	to	let	the	sheriff	know	when	I	saw that	the	storeroom	door	was	ajar.	I	was	certain	I’d	shut	it	when	I	closed	the	store. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 got	 Daniel’s	 attention,	 and	 he	 and	 the	 sheriff	 came	 over.	 I	 pointed	 at	 the door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mason	looked	at	the	door	and	then	back	at	me.	“Again?”	He	let	out	a	heavy</p>
<p class="calibre1">sigh	and	used	his	boot	to	push	open	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lights	were	on,	but	other	than	that	–	I	always	turned	them	off;	I	couldn’t afford	 any	 extra	 pennies	 on	 the	 electric	 bill	 –	 nothing	 looked	 out	 of	 place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks	fine,”	I	said	when	the	sheriff	looked	my	way	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>“Okay.	 Humor	 me,	 though,	 and	 take	 a	 walk	 around.”	 He	 looked	 at	 Daniel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	stay	with	her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course,”	Daniel	said	with	a	firm	nod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	to	duck	behind	a	stack	of	boxes	to	hide	my	grin,	and	when	I	did,	I	saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 small	 puddle	 of	 water.	 I	 looked	 up	 to	 be	 sure	 the	 ceiling	 wasn’t	 leaking	 and breathed	a	sigh	of	relief	when	I	didn’t	see	any	drops.	Roof	leaks	are	expensive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Daniel,	would	you	mind	taking	a	look?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	came	over	from	the	door,	and	when	I	pointed,	he	laid	a	gentle	hand	on	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	as	he	bent	down	to	study	the	water.	I	felt	my	heartbeat	quicken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Water?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	but	not	from	the	roof	I	don’t	think.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Weird.”	He	looked	up,	too.	“Yeah,	I	don’t	see	any	sign	of	water	up	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	from	someone’s	shoes	or	something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Could	be.	But	it’s	not	raining,	so	I	don’t	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	gave	me	a	sideways	grin.	“Maybe	it’s	like	that	old	riddle,	and	it	was	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">icicle	and	now	the	murder	weapon	has	melted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	chuckled.	“If	Stevensmith	had	been	stabbed,	I	might	think	you	were	onto</p>
<p class="calibre1">something.”	He	winked.	“That	combined	with	the	fact	that	it’s	far	too	warm	for icicles	makes	me	question	your	theory.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled.	“Way	to	crush	a	girl’s	dreams.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sometimes	the	truth	hurts.”	He	bent	down	and	put	a	finger	in	the	water	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	touched	the	tip	of	his	finger	to	his	tongue.	I	would	have	been	grossed	out	if I	hadn’t	thought	about	doing	the	same	thing.	“Just	water,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	odd.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 nodded,	 and	 we	 headed	 out	 of	 the	 storeroom,	 turning	 off	 the	 light	 and closing	the	door	behind	us.	We	made	our	way	to	the	front	of	the	store,	where	the sheriff	 and	 our	 friends	 waited.	 “Alright,	 so	 we’ll	 patrol	 through	 overnight	 and come	take	a	closer	look	at	things	in	the	morning.”	Until	then,	we’ve	put	a	big	old padlock	on	the	back	door	–	your	insurance	should	cover	the	repairs	for	that,	too, Harvey	 –	 to	 keep	 it	 secure.	 Just	 be	 sure	 to	 call	 your	 alarm	 company	 first	 thing since	you	won’t	have	a	second	egress	if	there’s	a	fire.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	Lord,	please,	let’s	hope	we	don’t	also	add	a	fire	to	a	murder	and	a	break-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a><img src="index-67_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">in,”	 Mart	 said.	 “I’ll	 come	 in	 tomorrow	 and	 handle	 that	 stuff.”	 She	 pulled	 me close	in	a	side-armed	hug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 we’re	 here,	 too,	 so	 we’ll	 help	 in	 the	 shop	 and	 keep	 an	 eye	 out	 for suspicious	folks,	too.”	Stephen	winked	at	the	sheriff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	good	friends,	Harvey.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	do.	Thanks,	Sheriff.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ready	 to	 lock	 up?”	 Mason	 held	 the	 door	 open	 for	 everyone	 but	 Mart	 and me.	I	wanted	to	do	a	last	pass	through	the	store,	be	sure	everything	was	closed up	tight	The	two	of	us	went	to	the	back	door	and	doublechecked	the	lock.	Then, I	 made	 sure	 some	 lights	 were	 on	 in	 both	 the	 shop	 and	 the	 café.	 As	 we	 headed toward	 the	 front	 door,	 Mart	 stopped	 me	 with	 a	 hand	 on	 my	 arm.	 “We	 did	 find that,”	she	pointed	to	the	right,	“but	I	don’t	know	if	it’s	anything.	So	I	wanted	you to	see	it	just	in	case	it’s	nothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	 the	 free-standing	 shelf	 that	 held	 biographies	 and	 memoirs,	 she	 had propped	up	a	thin	umbrella	with	a	long,	black	handle.	“Mart,	we	need	to	tell	the sheriff—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	will,	tomorrow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could	see	Daniel’s	face	under	the	street	lamp	outside,	and	he	seemed	a	little nervous.	 “Tonight,	 we’ve	 had	 enough.”	 She	 gave	 me	 a	 little	 shove	 toward	 the door.	“Let’s	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	started	to	hesitate,	but	the	store	was	locked	up	tight,	and	I	knew	Williams</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	be	stopping	by	on	patrol.	I	decided	I	could	call	the	sheriff	first	thing,	even before	the	alarm	company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	scooted	out,	and	the	little	bell	above	the	door	was	still	ringing	as	I	locked it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	 NEXT	 MORNING,	 I	 had	 this	 awful	 feeling	 that	 the	 umbrella	 was	 going	 to	 be gone	and	I	had	lost	valuable	evidence	for	the	investigation,	so	I	gobbled	down	a bowl	of	cereal	and	sprinted	with	Mayhem	to	the	shop	before	the	sun	was	even	up all	the	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>When	I	spun	around	the	corner	of	the	biography	shelf,	I	was	relieved	to	see the	umbrella	still	there,	just	as	it	had	been.	I	led	Mayhem	around	the	store	just	to be	sure	we	were	all	clear	and	checked	the	lock	at	the	back.	Everything	was	as	it should	be,	well,	except	for	the	fact	that	someone	had	been	murdered	in	my	shop and	there’d	been	a	break-in.	Otherwise,	everything	was	fine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 grabbed	 a	 plastic	 bag	 from	 under	 the	 counter	 and	 went	 to	 scoop	 up	 the umbrella.	I	didn’t	know	that	there	was	any	value	in	not	leaving	my	fingerprints	–</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	all,	Mart	had	been	carrying	the	thing	in	her	bare	hands	–	but	figured	better safe	than	sorry.	As	I	picked	it	up,	I	noticed	a	small	puddle	on	the	wooden	floor beneath	where	it	had	stood.	I	glanced	at	the	umbrella	and	back	at	the	puddle.	For the	most	part,	the	umbrella	itself	was	dry,	but	down	in	the	tip,	I	could	see	little glistens	of	water	droplets.  <i class="calibre4">This</i>	was	the	source	of	the	puddle	in	the	storeroom,	I was	sure	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 sheriff	 needed	 to	 know,	 and	 I	 had	 delayed	 long	 enough.	 I	 gave	 the sheriff’s	 office	 a	 ring,	 and	 the	 person	 on	 duty	 said	 he’d	 be	 over	 shortly.	 In	 the meantime,	 I	 had	 some	 puzzling	 to	 do.	 The	 umbrella	 was	 what	 the	 person	 had broken	in	to	get,	clearly,	but	then	why	had	they	dropped	it	out	back?	And	why</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	it	wet? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 had	 an	 inkling	 of	 the	 first	 answer	 –	 from	 the	 description	 it	 seemed	 likely this	was	the	murder	weapon.	The	thin,	cylindrical	handle	was	made	of	some	sort of	metal	coated	in	a	thin	cover	of	what	felt	like	black	rubber	that	reminded	me	of the	 spray	 stuff	 a	 lot	 of	 the	 folks	 with	 pick-up	 trucks	 used	 to	 protect	 their	 beds from	 scratches.	 Maybe	 the	 sheriff	 had	 found	 traces	 of	 that	 rubber	 in Stevensmith’s	wound	or	maybe	they	had	done	a	mold	of	the	injury	.	.	.	I	stopped myself	before	I	let	my	fascination	with	TV	dramas	lead	me	too	far	into	things	I didn’t	really	want	to	think	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	just	finished	making	a	pot	of	coffee	in	the	café	when	I	heard	a	knock	at the	 door	 and	 saw	 the	 sheriff	 waving	 a	 small,	 white	 bag	 in	 front	 of	 his	 face.	 I smiled	 –	 next	 to	 Rocky’s	 Mom’s	 cinnamon	 rolls,	 the	 sausage-egg-and-cheese biscuits	 from	 the	 gas	 station	 up	 the	 road	 were	 the	 best	 breakfast	 in	 town.	 I	 felt my	stomach	rumble	–	cereal	was	just	a	teaser	of	a	breakfast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thought	 you	 might	 need	 fortification,”	 the	 sheriff	 said	 as	 I	 unlocked	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>door.	“Now,	where’s	this	mysterious	item	you	found	in	your	snooping?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	blushed.	“We	were	just	curious,”	I	said	as	I	led	us	to	the	table	at	the	front	of the	café. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	what	happened	to	the	cat?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shivered.	I	did	know.	“It’s	right	here,”	I	said	and	gestured	to	the	umbrella I’d	propped	against	the	table.	“I	think	it’s	what	left	a	puddle	in	the	storeroom.	It left	another	where	Mart	set	it	last	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 sheriff	 picked	 up	 the	 umbrella	 in	 his	 gloveless	 hands,	 confirming	 my guess	that	fingerprints	were	a	moot	point,	and	looked	up	at	me.	“Smart	move	not to	 call	 me	 back	 last	 night.	 I	 imagine	 whoever	 cared	 enough	 to	 break	 in accidentally	 dropped	 this	 when	 you	 and	 your	 friends	 showed	 up.	 It’s	 best	 they not	know	we	recovered	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	bit	of	luck,	that.	I	was	just	sleepy	and	figured	you	were,	too.	“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Courtesy	and	good	rest	will	carry	you	a	long	way	in	this	world,”	the	sheriff</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	through	a	mouthful	of	biscuit.	“What	puzzles	me	is	the	water.	You’re	sure this	wasn’t	here	before?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	a	minute	to	think	about	the	storeroom	over	the	last	few	days.	“I	don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">think	so,	but	I	can’t	be	totally	sure.	I’ve	been	in	and	out	of	there	several	times,	of course,	 but	 always	 in	 a	 hurry	 or	 with	 my	 arms	 full.	 Not	 sure	 I	 would	 have noticed	it	behind	the	boxes	where	it	seems	like	it	was.	We	should	ask	Rocky.	Her café	supplies	are	in	there,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">I</i>	will	ask	Rocky,	Ms.	Super	Sleuth.	Leave	the	police	work	to	me,	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tilted	my	head	and	said,	“Sure,”	with	a	wide	grin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	like	talking	to	a	brick	wall,”	the	sheriff	muttered	with	a	small	smile.	“I expect	you	know	this	is	probably	the	murder	weapon,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wondered.	Right	shape?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks	like	it.	Heavy	enough,	too,”	he	said	as	he	dropped	the	handle	into	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand	 a	 couple	 of	 times.	 “And	 it’s	 long,	 so	 someone	 smaller	 could	 get	 a	 lot	 of leverage	if	they	swung	it	like	a	bat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 cringed.	 The	 image	 of	 that	 happening	 in	 my	 storeroom	 made	 me	 a	 little queasy.	“So	a	woman	isn’t	out	of	the	question.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope.	Not	at	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a><img src="index-70_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 sighed.	 I	 didn’t	 like	 the	 idea	 of	 anyone	 murdering	 anyone,	 but	 a	 woman committing	 murder	 felt	 a	 little	 worse	 to	 me	 than	 if	 a	 man	 had	 done	 it,	 like	 a strike	against	the	sisterhood	or	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Any	news	on	that	orange	paper?”	I	asked	with	what	I	felt	like	was	a	casual</p>
<p class="calibre1">air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sheriff	was	on	to	me,	though.	“You	mean	besides	the	flowers	at	Heron’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">Farm	Stand,	the	art	in	Divina’s	studio,	and	the	old	menus	from	Chez	Cuisine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	laughed.	“Right.	Besides	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope,	Ms.	Super	Sleuth,	I	believe	you	have	found	our	best	leads	there,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing	has	turned	up	yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	as	he	stood	and	took	the	umbrella.	“Mind	if	I	duck	out	the	back?	I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather	 not	 have	 all	 of	 town	 see	 me	 carrying	 an	 umbrella	 on	 a	 perfectly	 sunny day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	out	the	window	and	realized	the	sun	was	up,	and	it	was	gorgeous, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	kind	of	spring	morning	that	made	me	want	to	plant	a	million	flowers.	“Sure thing.	Need	me	to	unlock	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope,	got	my	key	right	here.”	I’d	been	grateful	when	he’d	told	me	he	kept	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">spare	key	to	the	padlock,	just	in	case.	It	felt	like	I	had	back-up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be	 wise,	 okay,	 Harvey?	 All	 joking	 aside.	 Someone	 is	 very	 invested,”	 he gestured	toward	the	shop’s	back	door,	“in	not	being	caught.	Don’t	go	riling	folks up,	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	I	knew	he	was	right.	I	needed	to	be	more	discreet	.	.	.	but	just	how is	 one	 discreet	 in	 a	 town	 where	 everyone	 knows	 everyone	 and	 everyone’s business? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 SPENT	 the	 next	 couple	 of	 hours	 ordering	 books	 and	 checking	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">alphabetization	 on	 the	 shelves,	 so	 by	 the	 time	 Mart	 and	 Rocky	 arrived	 a	 little before	ten,	I	felt	totally	calm.	One	of	the	reasons	I	had	wanted	to	open	this	store was	 that	 it	 was	 tangible	 in	 ways	 that	 my	 previous	 job	 as	 a	 fundraiser	 for nonprofits	hadn’t	been.	For	one,	I	could	see	what	I	was	selling.	I	loved	e-books, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>too,	but	there	was	nothing	like	a	physical	book	to	soothe	my	soul.	I	was	looking into	selling	e-books	through	our	shop	website,	too,	but	I	knew	I	wanted	to	focus most	of	my	time	–	and	money	–	on	the	print	copies	that	filled	these	shelves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Plus	shelving	–	it	was	like	meditation	to	me.	Give	me	a	big	library	cart	full</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 picture	 books	 and	 leave	 me	 to	 it	 .	 .	 .	 I’ll	 be	 calm	 and	 rested	 by	 day’s	 end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today,	 though,	 I	 didn’t	 have	 a	 cart	 of	 books	 to	 shelve,	 and	 my	 frazzled	 nerves sure	could	have	used	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	 wasted	 no	 time	 calling	 the	 insurance	 and	 alarm	 companies	 about</p>
<p class="calibre1">getting	the	alarm	system	and	door	repaired.	She	gave	me	a	wink	as	I	turned	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	final	banks	of	lights	and	flipped	on	the	cute	neon	sign	that	featured	Mayhem with	her	head	resting	on	a	few	books	below	the	word	 <i class="calibre4">Open</i>.	Stephen	and	Walter had	 commissioned	 that	 for	 me,	 and	 it	 was	 still	 my	 favorite	 moment	 of	 the morning	–	to	pull	the	little	chain	and	light	up	that	sign. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Woody	came	by	just	as	I	was	heading	to	the	café	for	my	morning	latte,	so	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">got	 him	 one,	 too,	 and	 assured	 him	 that	 everything	 was	 fine	 and	 that	 we	 hadn’t been	robbed.	The	grapevine	was	already	going	strong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	 Harvey,”	 he	 said.	 “I’m	 not	 going	 to	 ask	 any	 more	 questions	 then.	 I get	the	sense	that	it’s	best	to	leave	things	where	they	lie.	But	you	call	me	if	you need	anything.”	He	looked	at	me	seriously.	“I	mean	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Spontaneously,	I	gave	him	a	hug,	and	he	squeezed	me	tight	before	heading	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	front	door	with	his	to-go	cup. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	heading	back	to	the	register	with	a	fresh	latte	for	me	and	one	for	Mart</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	I	heard	the	bell	ring	and	saw	two	older	women,	one	white	and	one	Asian, </p>
<p class="calibre1">come	 in	 the	 store	 and	 head	 right	 for	 the	 fiction	 section.	 In	 my	 shop,	 I	 didn’t divide	 out	 genre	 fiction	 –	 horror,	 mystery,	 fantasy	 –	 from	 literary	 fiction	 like some	stores	did.	Books	were	books,	and	I	wanted	everybody	to	get	equal	billing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	second-class	books	here.	I	couldn’t	wait	to	see	what	they	picked	up	–	at	least I	hoped	they	picked	something	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Walter	and	Stephen	still	asleep?”	I	asked	as	I	handed	Mart	her	mug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded	while	she	took	a	long,	smooth	sip.	“Jet	lag.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jet	lag	and	wine,”	I	said	with	a	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 best	 combo.”	 Mart	 and	 I	 clinked	 our	 white,	 ceramic	 mugs.	 “Alarm</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>company	will	be	over	later	this	morning,	and	the	insurance	process	is	started.	I’ll keep	an	eye	out	for	the	tech	when	they	arrive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 thanked	 my	 best	 friend	 and	 caught	 her	 up	 on	 my	 conversation	 with	 the sheriff	 until	 the	 two	 customers	 arrived	 at	 the	 counter	 with	 a	 few	 books	 each.	 I complimented	 their	 choices	 –	 the	 new	 Rene	 Denfeld,	 an	 Alice	 Hoffman	 title, Jesmyn	 Ward’s	 latest,	 my	 favorite	 novel	 ever,  <i class="calibre4">Who	 Fears	 Death</i>	 by	 Nnedi Okorafor,	and	a	fun	YA	fantasy	novel	called	 <i class="calibre4">Supernatural	Reform	School</i>.	I	liked their	 eclectic	 taste	 and	 told	 them	 so,	 then	 glowed	 when	 they	 said	 they’d definitely	be	back	and	would	tell	their	friends	over	in	Annapolis	about	the	shop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	 the	 bell	 could	 even	 stop	 ringing	 over	 the	 front	 door,	 Mart	 was jumping	up	and	down	and	holding	my	hands.	“You	know	who	that	was,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 looked	 at	 the	 door	 and	 the	 back	 at	 my	 friend.	 “Who?	 One	 of	 those women?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	just	one	of	those	women.	Michiko	Kakutani	–	the	book	reviewer	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">New	York	Times</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,”	I	knew	I	was	supposed	to	be	impressed,	but	I	didn’t	know	why.	“She’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	big	deal,	I	guess?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	slapped	a	palm	to	her	forehead.	“You	are	impossible.	She’s	the	biggest</p>
<p class="calibre1">deal.	If	she	mentions	your	bookstore	anywhere,	it’ll	be	huge.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	then	I	hope	she	tells	all	her	friends.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	shook	her	head	and	headed	to	the	café	for	a	latte	refill.	A	few	moments</p>
<p class="calibre1">later,	I	heard	Rocky	shout,	“Michiko	Kakutani	was	here?”	Guess	she	 <i class="calibre4">was</i>	a	big deal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	I	was	still	googling	Kakutani	and	considering	what	residual	boon	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">visit	 to	 the	 shop	 might	 be,	 I	 caught	 a	 glimpse	 of	 Marcus	 riding	 down	 the sidewalk	 and	 rushed	 out	 to	 catch	 him.	 “Marcus!”	 I	 called	 his	 name	 down	 the street,	 but	 he	 didn’t	 slow.	 So	 I	 jogged	 –	 something	 I	 try	 to	 avoid	 doing	 unless being	chased	–	and	shouted	more	loudly.	This	time	he	stopped	and	pulled	an	ear bud	out	of	his	ear	before	turning	back	toward	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	hi	Ms.	Beckett.	I’m	sorry.	I	didn’t	hear	you.	You	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	out	of	breath,	and	I	imagined	my	face	was	flushed	since	even	climbing</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	flight	of	stairs	could	bring	the	color	to	my	cheeks.	I	made	a	commitment	to	do</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a><img src="index-73_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">a	little	more	than	stroll	the	neighborhood	with	Mayhem	over	the	next	couple	of months.	 “Yes,	 I’m	 fine.	 Sorry.	 Just	 wanted	 to	 catch	 you	 and	 see	 if	 you	 might have	time	to	do	a	bit	more	work	for	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiled.	“Oh	yeah,	I’d	be	happy	to.	What	do	you	need?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	someone	broke	into	my	shop,	and	I	need	a	little	help	fixing	the	door</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	doing	some	painting.	Is	that	something	you’d	be	comfortable	doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Absolutely.”	 He	 sounded	 eager,	 almost	 excited,	 and	 I	 wondered,	 again, about	his	story.	“When	do	you	need	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	are	you	free?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 paused	 and	 a	 sad	 look	 passed	 over	 his	 face,	 but	 then	 he	 met	 my	 gaze again	and	said,	“Anytime,	really.	I’m,	uh,	between	projects	right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alrighty	 then.	 This	 afternoon?	 Come	 by	 about	 noon,	 and	 I’ll	 hook	 you	 up with	a	sandwich,	too.	It’s	the	least	I	could	do	for	bringing	you	on	so	suddenly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	smile	grew.	“Sounds	like	a	plan.	See	you	soon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	back	to	the	shop	and	wondered	how	I	might	get	Marcus	to	tell	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	himself.	There	was	something	I	didn’t	know	about	that	young	man,	and	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt	like	it	might	be	important	for	me	to	know	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">STEPHEN	 AND	 WALTER	 came	 in	 about	 eleven	 looking	 well-rested	 and	 ready	 to work,	and	since	Mart	was	handling	alarm	repairs	and	the	insurance	and	Marcus</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	going	to	do	the	clean-up	and	painting	on	the	door,	I	asked	if	they	could	help me	by	sorting	the	stock	room.	It	had	been	creeping	me	out	that	everything	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	in	the	same	place	as	when	Stevensmith	had	been	killed,	and	the	sheriff	said	I could	go	ahead	and	move	things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 guys	 were	 oddly	 enthused	 by	 the	 idea.	 Walter	 asked,	 “So	 do	 you	 want everything	organized	by	color	or	alphabet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 cringed.	 “By	 alphabet.	 I’ve	 never	 understood	 bookshelves	 organized	 by color.	I	mean	they	look	pretty,	but	I	would	never	be	able	to	find	anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stephen	nodded,	but	Walter	said,	“You	verbal	people	will	never	get	us	visual</p>
<p class="calibre1">folks.	 I	 never	 remember	 who	 wrote	 a	 book,	 but	 I	 can	 tell	 you	 what	 the	 cover</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>looked	like	in	perfect	detail.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	can,”	Stephen	agreed,	“but	since	most	of	the	folks	will	not	know	these</p>
<p class="calibre1">books	 and,	 thus,	 can’t	 know	 the	 covers,	 I	 think	 it’s	 best	 to	 follow	 the	 expert’s lead	here.”	He	gave	me	a	wink,	and	they	headed	to	the	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 spent	 the	 next	 hour	 paying	 bills	 and	 trying	 to	 wrangle	 my	 budget.	 I	 was doing	 okay,	 but	 not	 as	 well	 as	 I’d	 dreamed	 we	 might.	 Maybe	 that	 Kakutani person’s	visit	would	be	a	little	burst	of	press?	Fingers	crossed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	just	about	to	head	over	to	the	café	and	see	what	Rocky	might	be	able	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	Marcus	for	lunch	when	the	bell	rang,	and	I	looked	over	to	see	Taco	making a	beeline	for	a	table	of	customers	that	included	a	toddler	who	was	gladly	sharing his	scone	with	Mayhem.	Taco	was	not	about	to	be	left	out	of	that	action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 followed	 his	 trail	 back	 toward	 the	 door	 and	 saw	 Daniel.	 He	 waved	 and headed	over.	“Mart	said	you	had	help	today,	so	I	wondered	if	I	could	steal	you for	the	afternoon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	toward	the	back	of	the	store	where	Mart,	Stephen,	and	Walter	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">huddled	together	watching.	I	took	a	quick	peek	to	be	sure	they	didn’t	have	a	tub of	popcorn	for	their	feature	film. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um,	sure,”	I	said	turning	back	to	Daniel.	“Looks	like	things	here	are	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">control.	Let	me	just	grab	my	coat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 walked	 briskly	 toward	 my	 friends,	 who	 didn’t	 even	 have	 the	 decency	 to scatter	and	pretend	they	hadn’t	been	watching,	and	hissed	as	I	walked	by,	“You three	are	ridiculous.	Mart,	you	told	him	to	come	by?	What	is	this,	junior	high?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	no,	woman,	this	is	big	girl	romance.	I’m	just	moving	things	along.	But	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	want	me	to	ask	him	if	he	likes	you	later	.	.	.	“</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 gave	 her	 a	 death	 glare.	 “Marcus	 will	 be	 here	 shortly.	 I	 told	 him	 I’d	 feed him,	 and	 then	 he’s	 going	 to	 repair	 the	 door	 and	 paint.	 Give	 him	 a	 bit	 of	 cash from	 the	 register	 to	 get	 what	 he	 needs	 next	 door.”	 Having	 a	 hardware	 store	 as your	neighbor	is	never	a	bad	thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	Ma’am,”	Mart	said	with	a	click	of	her	heels	and	a	smirk.	“Now,	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">date	is	waiting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 shot	 her	 another	 scowl	 as	 I	 rushed	 back	 by	 and	 then	 grinned	 when	 I	 saw Daniel	patiently	waiting.	“Taco	can	stay	here	if	you	want.”	I	looked	over	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a><img src="index-75_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">long,	low	dog.	“Looks	like	he	and	Mayhem	are	content.”	Both	dogs	had	found</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	way	onto	the	very	large	dog	bed	I’d	placed	on	the	center	of	the	stage	in	the café	and	were	snoozing	butt	to	butt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	a	dog’s	life,”	Daniel	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can	say	that	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	headed	out	the	door	and	turned	down	Main	Street.	“Tacos	okay?”	Daniel</p>
<p class="calibre1">asked	as	we	sauntered	along.	The	weather	was	perfect,	and	I	was	content	to	let my	meddling	friends	manage	the	store	all	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sounds	great.	And	actually,	if	you’re	up	for	it,	I	have	a	little	research	I	need to	do	at	the	library	after.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Research,	huh?	Why	do	I	think	this	isn’t	book	research?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 gave	 him	 a	 sly	 smile	 and	 slipped	 my	 hand	 onto	 his	 arm.	 He	 immediately covered	my	fingers	with	his	own,	and	I	felt	my	heart	kick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">AFTER	A	COMPLETELY	DELIGHTFUL	meal	of	some	of	the	best	tacos	I’ve	ever	eaten</p>
<p class="calibre1">–	I	was	pretty	sure	they’d	inspired	Daniel’s	dog’s	name	–	and	a	lovely	chat	on	a park	 bench	 while	 we	 ate	 our	 food	 truck	 meal,	 I	 coaxed	 Daniel	 over	 to	 the beautiful	brick	library	a	block	off	Main	Street.	“I	guess	the	library	is	pretty	new, huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	 the	 old	 one	 had	 been	 in	 a	 storefront	 on	 Main	 Street,	 but	 the	 town decided	 to	 move	 it	 and	 give	 that	 space	 to	 more	 tourist-friendly	 businesses.	 Not many	out-of-towners	use	the	local	library.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 makes	 sense.	 And	 this	 is	 gorgeous,”	 I	 said	 as	 we	 walked	 into	 a beautiful,	light-filled	atrium	where	the	circulation	desk	sat	surrounded	by	potted plants.	“I	could	work	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?!	Work	for	the	competition?	Never?!”	Daniel	said	with	mock	awe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 laughed.	 “Actually,	 I	 don’t	 think	 of	 the	 library	 as	 competition,	 more	 as camaraderie	on	the	quest	to	help	people	find	books	they	love.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	leaned	over	and	kissed	me	on	the	cheek.	“I	like	that,”	he	said.	“Now, </p>
<p class="calibre1">what	are	we	here	for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>It	took	me	a	while	to	get	my	words	back	after	that	show	of	affection,	but	I eventually	stammered	that	I	wanted	to	look	at	the	old	newspapers.	Then	I	said	I first	needed	to	use	the	restroom	and	rushed	off	to	splash	my	face	with	cold	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 I	 came	 back,	 Daniel	 did	 a	 wide	 sweep	 with	 his	 arm	 and	 pointed toward	the	back	of	the	building.	“To	the	microfilm,	my	lady.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 giggled.	 “Thank	 goodness	 they’re	 on	 microfilm.	 I	 love	 print	 as	 much	 as anybody,	but	I’m	glad	we	don’t	have	to	sort	through	years	of	paper.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 microfilm	 machines	 were	 as	 new	 as	 the	 building,	 and	 with	 a	 little guidance	from	the	librarian,	we	found	the	older	issues	of	the	 <i class="calibre4">St.	Marin’s	Courier</i> and	got	the	first	reel	loaded	to	the	machine.	As	I	started	to	scroll,	Daniel	asked, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what	are	we	looking	for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	was	wondering	if	what	got	Stevensmith	killed	was	something	in	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	her	articles.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	I	see.	So	we’re	looking	for	motive	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 looked	 at	 him	 out	 of	 the	 corner	 of	 my	 eye	 and	 could	 see	 his	 exaggerated expression	of	serious	interest.	“Yes,	we’re	looking	for	motive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	we’re	just	ignoring	Sheriff	Mason’s	caution?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	caution?”	I	tried	to	act	blissfully	ignorant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 one	 he	 shared	 with	 me	 after	 he	 came	 to	 see	 you	 at	 the	 store	 this morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	harrumphed.	“Does	no	one	think	I	can	manage	my	own	life?	First	Mart,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	the	sheriff?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	bumped	my	shoulder.	“He’s	just	concerned	and	knew	I	would	be,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	told	him	I’d	keep	you	close,	but	that	I	didn’t	think	I	could	stop	a	force	of	your nature.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 wanted	 to	 be	 annoyed,	 to	 be	 frustrated	 that	 everyone	 was	 speaking	 to people	about	me,	but	I	couldn’t	be.	It	just	felt	so	nice	to	have	people	care	.	.	.	to have	Daniel	care. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alright,”	 I	 let	 out	 a	 long	 sigh.	 “I’ll	 be	 careful.	 Not	 tell	 anyone	 what	 I’m doing.”	 I	 looked	 around	 the	 library	 to	 see	 no	 one	 was	 in	 this	 section.	 “Fair enough?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fair	enough	if	you	let	me	help.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a><img src="index-77_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	need	your	own	machine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	no	I	won’t.	I’m	staying	right	here.	The	sheriff	said	to	keep	you	close.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 was	 going	 to	 have	 to	 go	 splash	 my	 face	 again	 if	 this	 kept	 up.	 “I	 can	 live with	that.	Let’s	get	going.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The	Courier</i>	was	a	tiny	paper,	but	Stevensmith	had	been	there	a	long	time	–</p>
<p class="calibre1">twelve	 or	 thirteen	 years	 –	 and	 in	 a	 small	 paper,	 most	 of	 the	 articles	 had	 her byline.	 The	 majority	 were	 run-of-the-mill	 stuff	 –	 coverage	 of	 car	 accidents	 or local	 events.	 But	 the	 reporter	 also	 had	 a	 habit	 of	 making	 statements	 –	 like	 the ones	she	said	to	me	–	that	came	off	as	just	plain	mean-spirited.	If	I	had	wagered a	guess,	I’d	say	Stevensmith	was	a	woman	who	had	been	hurt	and	was	taking	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	pain	on	everyone	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually,	we	caught	up	to	where	the	microfilm	ended,	having	compiled	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">stack	 of	 fifteen	 to	 twenty	 pages	 worth	 of	 articles	 where	 Stevensmith	 was criticizing	 someone	 or	 something.	 But	 we	 still	 had	 the	 last	 four	 years	 of newspapers	 to	 cover	 online.	 We	 headed	 to	 a	 bank	 of	 computers,	 and	 I	 secretly hoped	that	Daniel	would	want	to	work	on	the	same	screen	with	me	again.	When</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	pulled	another	chair	into	the	cubicle	I	chose,	I	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	scanned	quickly	through	the	last	three	and	a	half	years	–	it	was	so	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">easier	 to	 read	 newspaper	 on	 a	 computer	 screen	 than	 on	 microfilm	 –	 and eventually	came	into	this	year.	I	was	almost	out	of	weekly	issues	when	I	came</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon	a	long	article	about	the	Harriet	Tubman	Festival	from	the	weekend	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	of	the	article	was	just	normal	stuff	–	an	interview	with	the	founder,	a	brief biography	 on	 Tubman,	 some	 highlights	 of	 the	 events	 around	 town	 –	 but	 at	 the bottom	 of	 the	 front	 page,	 where	 the	 article	 was	 featured,	 Stevensmith	 had written:</p>
<p class="calibre1">WHILE	THIS	FESTIVAL	is	a	good	tourist	event	for	St.	Marin’s,	it’s	a	shame	it’s	for such	an	over-lauded	person.	Sure,	Tubman	survived	slavery,	but	she	was	not	the only	one.	Plus,	wise	students	of	history	will	take	note	that	Tubman’s	escapades on	 the	 Underground	 Railroad	 were	 actually	 illegal,	 acts	 of	 theft	 of	 property. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a><img src="index-78_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="index-78_2.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps	we	should	be	revising	our	history	to	remember	her	as	the	criminal	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	rather	than	as	a	hero. </p>
<p class="calibre1">AS	 I	 READ	 THOSE	 WORDS,	 I	 gasped.	 Stevensmith	 had	 gone	 after	 a	 long-dead woman	 who	 had	 saved	 countless	 people	 from	 the	 horrors	 of	 slavery.	 “I	 can’t even	believe	someone	would	say	that	.	.	.	about	Harriet	Tubman.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Too	bad	Harriet	Tubman’s	ghost	doesn’t	carry	that	gun	she	owned,”	Daniel</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hear	that.	Why	would	someone	say	such	awful	things?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	just	shook	his	head	while	I	pressed	print. </p>
<p class="calibre1">AS	WE	WALKED	BACK	to	the	shop	so	I	could	close	up	for	the	night,	I	asked,	“Want to	come	over	tonight	and	help	me	piece	together	the	suspect	list?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	took	my	hand	and	squeezed	it.	“I	wish	I	could,	but	I	have	a	standing</p>
<p class="calibre1">date	on	Thursday	nights.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh.”	A	date,	huh?	I	didn’t	like	the	sound	of	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With	 the	 dog	 groomer.”	 Daniel	 squeezed	 my	 hand	 again.	 “I	 have	 to	 get Taco’s	nails	trimmed	once	a	week	or	it	sounds	like	someone	is	dropping	tacks	all over	the	floor	whenever	he	walks.	It’s	his	weekly	Puppy-Cure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	laughed.	“Oh	my.	I	didn’t	take	you	as	one	to	port	your	pooch	to	the	doggy</p>
<p class="calibre1">spa.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	a	lot	you	don’t	know	about	me,	yet,	Harvey	Beckett.	A	whole	lot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	winked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a><b class="calibre3">7</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">That	night,	after	I’d	filled	Mart,	Stephen,	and	Walter	in	on	my	lunch	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	 in	 the	 excruciating	 detail	 that	 they	 demanded,	 the	 four	 of	 us clambered	down	to	the	floor	around	our	coffee	table	and	started	reading</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 articles	 Daniel	 and	 I	 had	 copied.	 We’d	 each	 read	 an	 article	 and	 highlight anything	 that	 felt	 “murder-worthy”	 with	 our	 assigned	 color	 –	 I	 had	 insisted	 I have	blue	because	it	was	my	favorite	–	and	then	pass	it	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	task	was	made	incessantly	more	difficult	by	Aslan’s	persistent	laying	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">each	 stack	 of	 paper	 in	 succession.	 Someone	 new	 to	 cats	 might	 have	 tried	 to relocate	 her,	 but	 I	 was	 a	 seasoned	 cat	 owner	 and	 knew	 that	 such	 tactics	 only deepened	 feline	 resolve.	 So	 we	 simply	 slid	 the	 paper	 out	 from	 under	 her	 when we	needed	it	and	allowed	her	to	place	her	girth	on	the	next	stack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	an	hour	or	so,	we’d	ended	up	with	four	articles	that	felt	vicious	enough to	warrant	murder.	One	was	the	review	that	Max	Davies	was	obviously	so	bitter</p>
<p class="calibre1">about,	 one	 was	 the	 Tubman	 article.	 The	 third	 was	 a	 note	 about	 a	 local	 tractor show	that	Stevensmith	had	called	“degenerate”	while	also	describing	the	people who	 brought	 their	 tractors	 as	 “hillbillies	 who	 wouldn’t	 know	 their	 arses	 from their	exhaust.”	And	the	final	article	insulted	a	high	school	English	teacher	who had	spent	thousands	of	her	own	dollars	buying	books	for	a	Little	Free	Library	on campus	 so	 that	 the	 students	 could	 have	 easy	 access	 to	 reading	 material.	 The Library	had	been	vandalized,	and	the	act	had	broken	the	teacher	down	to	tears, which	prompted	Stevensmith	to	say	she	was	a	weak-hearted	woman	who	should</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a><img src="index-80_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">know	better	than	to	do	more	than	was	required	in	her	government	job. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 woman	 was	 a	 piece	 of	 work,”	 Stephen	 said	 when	 he’d	 read	 the	 last article.	“I	kind	of	want	to	kill	her	myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Daniel	 and	 I	 said	 the	 same	 thing.	 She	 was	 a	 really	 horrible	 person.”	 I couldn’t	believe	someone	would	put	such	awful	things	in	print. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 doorbell	 rang,	 and	 I	 jumped	 up	 with	 my	 wallet	 to	 pay	 for	 our	 pizza. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’d	been	so	engrossed	in	our	research	that	we’d	all	forgotten	to	eat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	opened	the	door,	I	was	surprised	to	see	Cate	and	Lucas	at	the	door, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pizza	box	in	hand.	“You	were	 <i class="calibre4">not</i>	the	pizza	delivery	people	I	was	expecting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No?”	 Cate	 grinned.	 “We	 were	 coming	 by	 to	 see	 your	 friends	 –	 did	 they mention	that	we	met	when	we	stopped	by	the	shop	earlier	today	while	you	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	your	date,”	she	winked,	and	I	shook	my	head,	“and	caught	the	delivery	gal	at the	end	of	the	walk.	Our	treat.”	She	handed	me	the	piping	hot	box. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	thanks.	Come	in	and	join	us.	Plenty	for	everyone.”	I	gestured	toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	door	and	followed	them	up	the	walk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	 as	 we	 were	 about	 to	 head	 in,	 Cate	 turned	 and	 whispered.	 “Daniel	 was practically	glowing	when	I	went	in	to	get	my	oil	changed	just	before	he	closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Must	have	been	some	date.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	wasn’t	really	a	date,”	I	said,	but	I	couldn’t	help	but	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh-huh,	I	see	that.”	Cate	gave	me	a	wink	and	went	on	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">AFTER	WE	ALL	had	slices	of	super-greasy,	super-perfect	pizza,	I	caught	Cate	and Lucas	up	on	what	we’d	found	in	the	articles.	“I	stopped	reading	her	stuff	a	long time	 ago.	 Made	 me	 too	 angry,	 especially	 when	 she	 went	 after	 the	 museum.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cate’s	jaw	was	set.	“No	one	messes	with	my	man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	yeah,	that	article	was	brutal	.	.	.	and	Stevensmith	was	wrong—you	aren’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	bit	bloated,	if	you	don’t	mind	me	saying,	Lucas,”	Stephen	said.	“What	was	her deal?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	one	really	knew,	and	lots	of	folks	tried	to	get	her	let	go	from	the	paper,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lucas	said.	“But	her	articles	sold	subscriptions.	A	lot	of	the	people	who	summer</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>here	 kept	 a	 subscription	 online	 just	 so	 they	 could	 see	 who	 Stevensmith	 would slam	next.	A	classic	case	of	sensational	journalism	if	ever	there	was	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	another	slice	of	pizza	and	proceeded	to	peel	the	cheese	off	and	eat	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	my	fingers	while	I	pondered.	“But	if	everyone	knew	she	was	hateful,	why</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 it	 still	 make	 someone	 mad?	 I	 mean,	 she	 was	 pretty	 much	 pissing	 off people	who	knew	better	than	to	read	what	she	said	anyway,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“True,”	 Cate	 said,	 “but	 people	 still	 got	 mad.	 Anytime	 someone	 says</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	demeaning	about	you,	it	stings,	even	if	you	know	you	shouldn’t	take</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	personally.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	of	Max	Davies	and	how	bitter	he	still	was	about	that	review	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">five	years	ago.	She’d	been	pretty	hard	on	Elle	Heron,	too.	And	that	poor	English teacher.	Cate	was	right.	Lots	of	people	had	a	reason	to	dislike	Stevensmith.	“But does	it	sting	badly	enough	to	kill	her?	I	mean	you	have	to	be	either	hopping	mad or	really	angry	for	a	really	long	time	to	commit	a	murder,	don’t	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	 think	 so,”	 Walter	 said	 as	 he	 got	 up	 to	 refill	 everyone’s	 glasses	 with Pepsi.	The	only	drink	that	befits	great	pizza	is	Pepsi,	and	I	was	glad	to	see	my friends	all	agreed.	“But	then,	I’ve	never	committed	murder.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 room	 got	 quiet	 for	 a	 while,	 and	 then	 Mart	 said,	 “Okay,	 who’s	 up	 for Apples	to	Apples?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	looked	at	her	like	she’d	just	sprouted	a	second	head	until	she	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	game.	You	don’t	know	it?	I	thought	it	might	be	fun	to	play	since	we’re	all here	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	be	up	for	a	round	or	two,”	Cate	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 not	 like	 we’re	 going	 to	 solve	 this	 murder	 tonight,	 anyway,”	 I	 said	 as	 I grabbed	wine	glasses	and	two	bottles	of	pinot	noir.	Pepsi	for	pizza,	red	wine	for after. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 pretty	 sure	 the	 sheriff	 would	 prefer	 you	 not	 try	 to	 solve	 anything,	 my dear,”	Stephen	said	as	he	poured	himself	a	large	glass	and	resumed	his	seat	on the	 floor.	 “But	 I	 also	 expect	 he	 knows,	 by	 now,	 that	 his	 preferences	 and	 your desires	might	not	align. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	kicked	him	under	the	table	and	smiled.	He	was	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a><img src="index-82_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	NEXT	DAY,	the	shop	was	busy	from	the	minute	we	opened	until	we	closed	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">seven.	 Michiko	 Kakutani	 had	 indeed	 mentioned	 the	 shop	 on	 Twitter	 and included	a	photo	of	the	storefront,	and	that,	coupled	with	what	Cate	told	me	were the	 usual	 beginnings	 of	 the	 tourist	 season,	 meant	 we	 had	 an	 amazing	 day	 of sales. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	grateful	.	.	.	for	the	sales,	but	also	for	the	distraction	because,	of	course, tonight	 Daniel	 was	 coming	 over	 for	 movie	 night.	 If	 the	 shop	 had	 been	 slow,	 I would	 have	 probably	 gnawed	 my	 fingers	 to	 the	 first	 joint.	 As	 it	 was,	 I	 simply had	a	very	short,	very	ragged	manicure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	we’d	finally	turned	off	the	lights,	set	the	alarm,	and	headed	out,	Rocky</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 I	 were	 dragging	 but	 invigorated.	 “That	 was	 a	 good	 day,	 Boss,”	 she	 said	 as we	stopped	outside	the	shop	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Boss?	You	don’t	need	to	call	me	boss,	Rocky.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	I	don’t	need,	too,	but	I	like	to.	Think	of	it	like	‘You	da	boss,’	as	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘You’re	a	badass.’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	laughed.	“So	not	as	in	 <i class="calibre4">Who’s	the	Boss? </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rocky’s	blank	stare	reminded	me	firmly	of	our	age	difference. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	waved	a	hand.	“Never	mind.	Eighties	reference.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	giggled.	“I	love	that	old-school	stuff.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,”	 I	 said	 as	 I	 tried	 not	 to	 roll	 my	 eyes.  <i class="calibre4">Old	 school</i>.	 “Want	 to	 walk	 or drive	over?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	drive,”	she	said	as	I	heard	the	beep	of	her	car’s	alarm.	“It’ll	save	me	the trouble	later.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	waved	as	Mayhem	and	I	started	down	the	street.	Spring	was	definitely	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 still	 chilly,	 but	 the	 air	 felt	 damper,	 more	 green	 somehow.	 Plus,	 the lingering	 moments	 of	 dusk	 promised	 longer	 days.	 I	 was	 typically	 an	 autumn enthusiast,	but	this	spring	might	just	sway	me	to	her	favor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayhem	sniffed	her	 way	along	the	 sidewalk,	noting	the	 earlier	visitors	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	 gifts	 passersby	 had	 left	 in	 the	 way	 of	 crumbs.	 I	 enjoyed	 the	 window displays,	particularly	in	the	co-op.	Cate	had	stopped	by	to	suggest	I	take	a	look</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>on	 my	 way	 home	 since	 they	 were	 featuring	 some	 of	 Woody’s	 pieces.	 I’d mentioned	wanting	a	small	table	to	put	behind	my	sofa,	and	she’d	told	me	about a	 gorgeous	 one.	 It	 was	 indeed	 beautiful,	 but	 pricey	 –	 well-worth	 the	 price	 for such	 fine	 work,	 but	 I’d	 need	 a	 few	 more	 really	 good	 weekends	 to	 justify	 that kind	of	expense,	even	from	a	friend	like	Woody. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 were	 about	 to	 turn	 and	 head	 up	 our	 street	 when	 Mayhem	 stopped	 cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	hackles	rose	along	her	back,	and	the	top	of	her	head	wrinkled.	A	low	growl piled	up	in	her	throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knelt	down	beside	her.	“You	see	something?”	The	growl	got	louder,	and	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned	to	face	behind	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 spun	 around,	 but	 I	 didn’t	 see	 anything.	 Mayhem	 didn’t	 calm,	 though.	 In fact,	she	started	to	bark	and	tug	hard	at	her	leash.	She	was	definitely	seeing	or hearing	or	smelling	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unsure	what	to	do	–	I	didn’t	want	to	turn	my	back	on	whoever	or	whatever</p>
<p class="calibre1">might	 be	 back	 there,	 but	 I	 didn’t	 want	 to	 go	 investigate	 either	 –	 I	 took	 a	 deep breath	 and	 decided	 our	 best	 course	 of	 action	 was	 to	 stay	 on	 the	 busier,	 if	 not really	 busy,	 Main	 Street.	 I	 held	 the	 leash	 tight	 and	 tugged	 Mayhem	 across	 the street,	trying	to	act	as	if	we	were	simply	taking	an	evening	stroll.	If	someone	was following	us,	I	didn’t	think	they’d	buy	it,	but	maybe	they’d	have	sense	enough not	to	accost	us	in	the	full	light	of	the	street	lamps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 kept	 walking,	 picking	 up	 our	 pace	 a	 bit,	 the	 growl	 still	 climbing Mayhem’s	throat.	I	thought	about	heading	back	to	the	store	and	letting	the	alarm bring	the	police,	but	I	didn’t	know	how	quickly	I	could	fish	out	my	keys.	Plus,	if it	turned	out	to	be	nothing,	I’d	feel	very	foolish	when	the	sheriff	arrived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 glanced	 in	 the	 shop	 windows	 as	 we	 practically	 jogged	 by.	 Everything looked	fine,	and	I	regretted	my	decision	not	to	stop	almost	immediately	when	I heard	footsteps	behind	me.	I	didn’t	dare	look	back	lest	I	see	someone	lunging	at me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quick	as	lightning,	Mayhem	lurched	forward,	dragging	me	into	the	street.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">tried	 to	 slow	 her	 down,	 yelling	  <i class="calibre4">Stop</i>	 with	 my	 best	 “alpha	 dog”	 voice,	 but	 she kept	going.	She	was	either	terrified,	or	.	.	. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	I	saw	where	she	was	headed	and	heard	the	baying	of	a	familiar	hound</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a><img src="index-84_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">dog	voice.	Daniel’s	shop	was	straight	ahead,	and	the	lights	were	on.	We	bolted into	the	garage,	and	Mayhem	let	out	a	volley	of	sharp	barks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	came	out	of	a	door	at	a	run,	and	I	felt	tears	of	relief	spring	to	my	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harvey,	are	you	okay?”	He	was	by	my	side	in	seconds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 fell	 into	 his	 chest	 and	 let	 out	 a	 hard	 sob.	 His	 arms	 came	 around	 my	 back and	 pulled	 me	 tight	 to	 him.	 A	 few	 moments	 later,	 when	 my	 sobs	 subsided,	 he pushed	me	gently	away	from	him	and	asked,	“You	okay?	What	happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pointed	toward	a	low	stool	at	the	side	of	the	garage,	and	he	walked	me	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	I	could	sit	down.	“I’m	not	sure,	honestly.	Mayhem	heard	or	saw	something, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	she	brought	me	here.	I	thought	I	heard	footsteps	behind	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	walked	to	the	door	and	looked	out	with	Mayhem	at	his	heels.	“I	don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	anything,	but	I’m	glad	you	came	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 didn’t	 see	 anything	 either.	 But	 Mayhem	 doesn’t	 usually	 act	 like	 that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	she	just	smelled	bacon.”	I	tried	to	laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 doubt	 it.	 That’s	 your	 girl.	 She	 knew	 you	 were	 in	 danger.”	 His	 voice	 was serious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	feel	silly.	Maybe	it	was	just	my	imagination.	You	guys	were	so	worried.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">guess	I	got	a	little	spooked.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	kneeled	down	to	look	into	my	face.	“I	don’t	know	you	well,	Harvey, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 you’re	 not	 a	 person	 who	 scares	 easily,	 I	 can	 tell	 you	 that.	 If	 you	 –	 and Mayhem	here	–	thought	someone	was	out	there,	someone	was	out	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 still	 felt	 a	 little	 ridiculous,	 but	 his	 confidence	 in	 my	 good	 sense	 was bolstering.	To	be	believed	is	not	a	minor	thing.	I	took	a	long,	deep	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	you	could	walk	me	over	for	movie	night?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	 be	 honored,	 and	 if	 it’s	 okay	 with	 you,	 I’ll	 walk	 you	 home	 each	 night after	this,	too.”	He	blushed	a	little.	“I	mean,	until	they	catch	the	killer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	winked	at	him.	“But	only	until	then.	Once	this	murder	is	solved,	I’m	on	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">own.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right.	Exactly.”	He	put	out	his	hand	and	helped	me	up.	Then,	he	kept	hold</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	my	hand	all	the	way	to	my	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>MOVIE	 NIGHT	 WAS	 PERFECT.	Terrifying	–	especially	after	my	scare	earlier	in	the evening	 –	 but	 perfect.	 Somehow,	 being	 so	 scared	 that	 I	 had	 to	 keep	 my	 hand over	 my	 mouth	 because	 I	 kept	 making	 everyone	 else	 scream	 when	 I	 screamed took	 away	 some	 of	 the	 terror	 of	 earlier	 in	 the	 evening.	 But	 that	 didn’t	 mean	 I wasn’t	scared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or	that	my	friends	were	going	to	let	me	pretend	I	wasn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	 had	 already	 cancelled	 an	 overnight	 trip	 for	 a	 consulting	 gig	 outside Philly,	and	Walter	and	Stephen	had	vowed	to	be	at	the	store	every	minute	for	the next	 two	 days	 just	 as	 back-up.	 “Back-up	 for	 what?”	 I’d	 joked.	 “Will	 your organizational	skills	fend	off	an	attacker?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stephen	 had	 thrown	 a	 pillow	 at	 me,	 and	 I’d	 smiled.	 Once	 again,	 I	 was reminded	that	I	had	good	people	around	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 midnight,	 when	  <i class="calibre4">Us</i>	 ended,	 I	 walked	 Daniel	 to	 the	 door.	 I’d	 told	 him that	he	and	Taco	were	welcome	to	crash	on	the	couch,	but	he’d	noted	that	Rocky seemed	to	have	already	claimed	that	honor.	She	had	passed	out	halfway	into	the second	movie,	and	when	her	phone	had	gone	off,	I’d	answered	her	mom’s	text</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	telling	her	that	Rocky	was	safe	and	could	stay	here	for	the	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Besides,	Taco	and	I	will	sleep	better	in	our	own	beds,”	Daniel	said.	Then	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaned	in	closer.	“Do	you	need	me	to	stay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	no.	I	have	plenty	of	company.	It’s	just	late,	and	well,	I’d	kind	of	like	you to	 stay.”	 I	 blushed	 at	 my	 candor.	 Adrenaline,	 hard	 cider,	 and	 fatigue	 made	 me brazen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 gave	 me	 a	 tender	 smile.	 “I’d	 like	 to	 stay,	 too.	 But	 maybe	 our	 first sleepover	can	just	be	the	two	of	us	sometime.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	felt	my	heart	kick	hard	against	my	chest.	“I’d	like	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 leaned	 down	 and	 placed	 a	 tender	 kiss	 on	 my	 lips	 before	 turning	 and heading	down	the	drive	with	Taco	trailing	behind	at	the	speed	of	molasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 gentle	 kiss	 made	 sleep	 come	 easily,	 but	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 night,	 I jerked	 awake	 and	 sent	 Aslan	 hissing	 to	 the	 floor.	 I’d	 had	 a	 nightmare	 about	 a giant	 paper	 flower	 chasing	 me	 down	 the	 street.	 That	 image	 haunted	 me	 until	 I got	up,	checked	the	doors,	and	made	sure	Mayhem	was	on	the	couch	by	the	front</p>
<p class="calibre1">door.	 She	 raised	 her	 head	 as	 I	 walked	 through.	 “Always	 on	 alert,	 aren’t	 you, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a><img src="index-86_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">girl?”	I	gave	her	a	good	rub	before	heading	back	to	try	and	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	NEXT	MORNING,	I	woke	to	the	smell	of	bacon	and	came	out	to	find	all	three</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	my	closest	friends	dressed	and	cooking	in	the	kitchen.	“You	guys	are	up	and about	early.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	we	have	a	bookstore	to	run,”	Walter	said	as	he	handed	me	my	largest</p>
<p class="calibre1">mug	full	of	the	darkest	coffee	I’d	ever	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled.	“Thanks,	guys.	Really.”	The	coffee	was	so	good,	and	I	was	going	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">need	 it.	 I	 hadn’t	 slept	 well	 after	 my	 nightmare,	 and	 if	 yesterday	 was	 an indication,	it	was	going	to	be	a	doozy	of	a	day	at	the	shop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	quick	shower,	I	took	an	extra	second	to	slather	on	my	favorite	vanilla lotion	before	heading	to	the	foyer	to	walk	to	the	shop.	As	I	passed	Mart	she	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ooh,	vanilla.	Someone’s	hopeful.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	talking	about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	 nothing,”	 she	 said	 with	 a	 conspiratorial	 wink.	 “You	 just	 only	 wear vanilla	when	you	feel	really	good	about	yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 started	 to	 object,	 but	 then	 realized	 two	 things.	 My	 objection	 would	 do nothing	 but	 make	 me	 look	 defensive,	 and	 also,	 Mart	 was	 right.	 I	 did	 feel	 good about	myself.	A	kiss	from	a	handsome	man	will	do	that	to	a	person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 that	 good	 feeling	 faded	 away	 as	 we	 reached	 Main	 Street,	 though.	 One block	up	from	the	shop,	the	street	was	closed	by	a	police	car	with	its	lights	on, and	 I	 could	 see	 a	 group	 of	 people	 milling	 around	 on	 the	 sidewalks	 nearby.	 By some	sort	of	tacit	agreement,	my	friends	and	I	crossed	the	street	and	passed	by the	 commotion	 as	 far	 from	 it	 as	 possible.	 Maybe	 we	 knew	 that	 we’d	 just	 be	 in the	way.	Maybe	we	didn’t	want	to	be	voyeurs	about	someone	else’s	mishap.	Or</p>
<p class="calibre1">maybe	 we’d	 all	 just	 had	 enough	 adventure	 for	 the	 time	 being.	 But	 none	 of	 us tried	to	see	what	was	going	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Which	was	just	as	well	because	in	a	small	town,	nothing	stays	quiet	for	long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within	minutes,	Woody	had	come	in	and	found	me.	“You	should	know,	Harvey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deputy	Williams	was	killed	last	night.”	I	took	a	step	back	and	ran	into	the	wall</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>of	bookshelves	behind	me.	“What?!	Murdered.	There	on	the	street?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	not	exactly	on	the	street.	She	was	in	back	of	the	stores	here,	by	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">parking	lot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 felt	 lightheaded.	 “Oh	 my	 word.”	 I	 couldn’t	 find	 anything	 else	 to	 say,	 so	 I just	stood	there	and	let	the	tears	slide	down	my	cheeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hadn’t	known	her	well,	but	I	did	know	her.	And	this	was	the	second	murder</p>
<p class="calibre1">nearby	in	the	past	week.	All	that	combined	with	my	scare	the	night	before	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	near	losing	it	in	my	own	shop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	then,	Daniel	came	in.	He	took	one	look	at	my	face	and	grabbed	a	chair</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	café.	“Sit	down,	Harvey.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walter	stepped	out	from	around	the	young	adult	bookshelf,	studied	my	face, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	headed	to	the	back.	Seconds	later,	he,	Stephen,	and	Mart	were	there,	all	with looks	of	deep	concern	on	their	faces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Woody	told	them	what	had	happened,	and	Mart	slid	down	the	wall	to	sit	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 floor.	 Walter	 and	 Stephen	 put	 their	 arms	 around	 one	 another.	 It	 was	 very quiet	for	a	few	moments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	 I	 let	 out	 a	 shuddering	 breath	 and	 said,	 “Do	 they	 know	 what happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Apparently,”	 Woody	 said,	 “she	 was	 doing	 her	 patrol	 about	 seven-thirty when	someone	ambushed	her.	Killed	her	instantly,	it	looks	like.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	 least	 she	 didn’t	 suffer,”	 Stephen	 said	 as	 he	 glanced	 at	 me.	 I	 must	 have looked	terrible	because	he	said,	“Harvey?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	looked	up	at	Woody.	“Did	you	say	about	seven-thirty?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	wasn’t	my	imagination.”	I	leaned	my	head	back	and	stared	at	the	ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayhem	 had	 heard	 Deputy	 Williams’	 murder	 –	 that’s	 what	 got	 her	 so	 scared	 –</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	hadn’t	done	a	thing.	“I	could	have	helped	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harvey	Beckett,	you	need	to	stop	it	right	now.”	Mart	crawled	over	and	put</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	face	in	mine.	“You	were	almost	a	second	victim.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Third,”	I	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	Mart	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	almost	the	third	victim.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>Mart	sighed.	“Right.	The	third	victim.	If	you	had	tried	to	help,	you	definitely would	 have	 been.”	 She	 sank	 to	 the	 floor	 again	 and	 dropped	 her	 head	 into	 her hands.	I	thought	she	might	be	crying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	took	my	hand.	“Mart’s	right,	Harvey.	Mayhem	saved	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somewhere	in	the	fog	of	shock,	I	could	feel	myself	with	two	choices	–	give</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	and	let	myself	fall	apart	or	take	a	deep	breath	and	move	forward.	I	breathed	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	I	stood	up.	“I	need	to	talk	to	the	sheriff,	tell	him	what	happened	to	me last	night.	Maybe	it	will	help.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Woody	headed	toward	the	door,	“I’ll	get	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	he	okay?”	I	asked	the	older	man	as	he	opened	the	front	door.	“Were	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	Deputy	Williams	close?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	 per	 se,	 I	 don’t	 think.	 But	 then	 is	 anybody	 really	 okay	 when	 someone you	know	is	killed?”	He	gave	a	sad	smile	and	let	the	door	close	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stephen	looked	me	hard	in	the	face	and	then	asked,	“What	can	I	get	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 thought	 for	 a	 minute.	 “Chamomile	 tea	 with	 lots	 of	 honey	 and	 lemon.”	 I needed	to	steady	myself,	slow	down	my	heart	rate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	got	it,”	Stephen	said	and	headed	toward	the	café. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	want	to	stay	open?”	Mart	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	do.	Books	help	in	a	crisis.	This	is	a	way	we	can	help.	Let’s	put	up	a	sign</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 says,	 ‘Free	 coffee.’	 And	 I’ll	 put	 together	 a	 display	 for	 the	 front	 table	 of books	on	grief	and	trauma.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	put	his	arm	around	my	shoulders.	“Lead	the	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 steered	 us	 toward	 the	 psychology	 section	 to	 do	 what	 I	 could	 do	 –</p>
<p class="calibre1">recommend	books	people	needed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neighbors	 streamed	 into	 the	 store	 all	 day	 –	 some	 to	 have	 a	 cup	 of	 coffee, many	to	just	see	people	from	the	community	together.	We	didn’t	make	a	lot	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">sales,	but	it	still	felt	like	the	shop	was	serving	its	purpose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 one	 point,	 I	 came	 upon	 Marcus	 reading	 in	 the	 fiction	 section.	 He	 had	 a copy	of	Margaret	Atwood’s	 <i class="calibre4">Oryx	and	Crake</i>	in	his	hand,	and	he	was	apparently so	 engrossed	 in	 the	 story	 that	 he	 didn’t	 hear	 me	 walk	 up.	 “Oh,	 that	 book	 is amazing,”	I	said,	and	he	almost	jumped	to	the	ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	put	a	hand	on	his	heart.	“Shi—take	mushrooms,	Ms.	Beckett.	You	scared</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a><img src="index-89_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	so	sorry,	Marcus.”	I	sat	down	on	the	arm	of	the	chair	next	to	him.	“You</p>
<p class="calibre1">must	really	be	liking	this	book.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am.	You’ve	read	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Read	the	whole	trilogy.	Some	of	Atwood’s	best.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiled.	“Yeah,	I	agree.	I	mean	I	loved	 <i class="calibre4">The	Handmaid’s	Tale</i>,	but	this	one, the	science	.	.	.	I’m	dying	to	read	the	next	two.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 kid	 was	 a	 reader,	 an	 astute	 reader.	 I	 knew	 we’d	 been	 brought	 together for	a	reason.	“Well,	we	have	them	when	you’re	ready.	You	can	sit	right	here	and read	the	whole	trilogy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	down.	“Really?	I	mean,	I	know	these	books	are	for	sale.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really.”	I	put	my	hand	on	his	shoulder.	“Any	fan	of	Atwood	can	read	here</p>
<p class="calibre1">anytime.	 But	 mind	 if	 I	 ask	 a	 rude	 question	 –	 how	 did	 you	 hear	 about	 her?	 I mean,	these	books	aren’t—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aren’t	 exactly	 standard	 reading	 for	 a	 black	 man	 in	 America?”	 He	 was smiling,	 but	 I	 could	 also	 hear	 an	 edge	 in	 his	 voice.	 “My	 mom	 was	 an	 English teacher.	 She	 introduced	 me	 to	  <i class="calibre4">The	 Cat’s	 Eye</i>	 back	 in	 eighth	 grade.	 Something about	Atwood’s	stories	just	intrigues	me.	They’re	almost	magical,	but	not	quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">.	.	.	and	there’s	always	this	thread	of	hope.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	patted	his	shoulder.	“Exactly.	I	love	her,	too.	When	you’re	done	with	these, check	out	A.	S.	Byatt.	Do	you	know	her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only	 <i class="calibre4">Possession</i>,	but	if	you	recommend	her	other	stuff,	I’ll	totally	read	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	kid	was	amazing.	“I’ll	put	together	a	list.”	I	smiled	and	stood	up.	“I’ll let	you	get	back	to	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">THAT	EVENING,	we	all	sat	around	the	shop	floor	–	Mart,	Stephen,	Walter,	Daniel, Woody,	Rocky,	and	I	–	and	passed	cartons	of	Chinese	food	around.	The	store	had been	 slammed.	 The	 news	 of	 the	 murder	 had	 traveled,	 so	 that	 brought	 more people	to	town	than	usual.	Plus,	the	prominent	mention	on	social	media	and	the first	of	the	real	tourist	trade	had	meant	we	were	bustling	as	soon	as	the	street	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>reopened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sheriff	had	come	by	late	in	the	afternoon	to	get	my	statement	about	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">night	before.	He’d	looked	haggard,	worn	down,	raw.	Rocky	brought	him	a	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">large	latte	with	extra,	extra	cream,	and	he	drank	it	down	in	one	gulp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hard	day,	huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	hardest.	Nothing	about	this	job	is	particularly	easy	–	except	maybe	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">parades,”	he	said	with	a	weak	smile.	“But	when	it’s	someone	you	know	.	.	.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.”	We	sat	in	silence	for	a	while. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	someone	was	following	you	last	night,	Woody	said?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 shrugged.	 “I	 think	 so.	 I	 mean,	 I	 was	 really	 scared.	 And	 Mayhem	 was	 all kinds	of	worked	up,	but	I	didn’t	really	see	anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.	Tell	me	exactly	what	happened.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	I	reviewed	the	play-by-play	of	the	night	before,	he	said,	“Yep,	it	sounds like	 Mayhem	 heard	 the	 murder.	 The	 timeline	 matches	 up	 almost	 perfectly.	 Too bad	she	can’t	testify.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	glanced	over	at	my	beautiful,	red-headed	pooch	as	she	slept,	again,	butt	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">butt	 with	 Taco,	 and	 sent	 her	 a	 pulse	 of	 gratitude.	 Then,	 an	 idea	 came	 to	 me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	she	can.	Do	you	have	a	minute?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sheriff	gave	me	a	puzzled	look.	“Sure.	What	do	you	have	in	mind?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	called	Mayhem	over.	“She	definitely	knew	something	was	going	on.	Maybe</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	can	sniff	something	out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sheriff	smiled.	“I	can	see	the	headlines	now,	‘Local	dog	bests	sheriff.’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sure	she’ll	give	you	all	the	credit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 snapped	 on	 Mayhem’s	 leash	 and	 told	 Daniel	 what	 was	 up.	 He	 leashed	 up Taco	 as	 official	 scent	 hound,	 and	 we	 headed	 out	 on	 the	 street	 while	 Mart watched	the	register. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Too	much	activity	out	here	on	the	street	today,	but	maybe	out	back,”	I	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	I	led	Mayhem	around	the	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	let	the	dogs	sniff	and	putter	along	the	parking	lot	for	a	few	minutes,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">then,	Taco	started	baying	and	was	off.	I	had	no	idea	a	Basset	Hound	could	move that	 fast,	 but	 Daniel	 was	 practically	 jogging	 to	 keep	 up.	 Then,	 Mayhem	 caught the	scent,	and	I	was	sprinting	along	behind	her.	They	were	headed	up	the	street</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a><img src="index-91_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">toward	 Daniel’s	 garage,	 which	 I	 could	 just	 see	 between	 buildings	 as	 we	 ran. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	 we	 darted	 off	 into	 the	 empty	 field	 behind	 the	 art	 co-op,	 and	 the	 dogs slowed	to	put	their	noses	to	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	 seen	 hunters	 run	 dogs	 before,	 but	 I’d	 never	 been	 a	 big	 fan	 of	 chasing down	 an	 animal	 –	 either	 for	 sport	 or	 for	 the	 kill.	 So	 Mayhem	 had	 never	 been trained	 to	 hunt.	 But	 these	 dogs	 were	 hounds,	 and	 their	 scent	 instincts	 were kicking	 in	 hard.	 Within	 a	 minute,	 they’d	 centered	 in	 on	 a	 swatch	 of	 grass	 near the	road,	stopped,	and	stood	stock	still. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sheriff	gave	me	a	look	and	headed	over.	There,	glinting	in	the	grass,	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	knife	with	a	long,	thin	blade.	And	at	the	tip,	there	was	blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">FOR	 THE	 SECOND	 time	 that	 day,	 a	 street	 in	 St.	 Marin’s	 was	 closed	 off,	 and	 the entire	police	force	of	the	county	was	on	site.	Fortunately	for	the	store,	most	of the	 police	 activity	 was	 behind	 the	 building,	 so	 we’d	 stayed	 open	 and	 available for	customers	who	just	needed	a	place	to	rest	or	be	distracted.	But	by	the	end	of the	 day	 when	 the	 Chinese	 food	 had	 been	 delivered,	 courtesy	 of	 Rocky	 and	 her mom,	we	were	all	frazzled,	exhausted,	and	full	of	questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	 this	 person	 really	 has	 something	 to	 hide?	 And	 Deputy	 Williams	 must have	been	on	to	it,	you	think?”	Mart	asked	between	mouthfuls	of	Lo	Mein. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seems	 to	 be	 the	 case.	 Or	 at	 least	 the	 murderer	 thought	 she	 was	 on	 to	 it,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Woody	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	swallowed	my	bite	of	General	Tso’s	chicken	and	said,	“So	we	think	it’s	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same	person?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pretty	big	coincidence	if	two	murders	happen	in	almost	the	same	spot	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">aren’t	connected	in	some	way?”	Walter	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“True.”	I	put	my	chopsticks	down	and	leaned	back	onto	my	elbows,	knowing</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 back	 would	 regret	 this	 position	 in	 about	 two	 minutes.	 “Then,	 if	 that’s	 the case,	what	did	the	deputy	find?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 silence	 settled	 in	 while	 everyone	 pondered	 what	 might	 have	 been	 worth killing	for	.	.	.	twice. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>“Do	 you	 think	 someone	 was	 trying	 to	 break	 in	 here	 again?”	 Daniel’s	 voice sounded	 edgy,	 like	 he	 was	 angry,	 maybe.	 I	 was	 angry,	 though,	 so	 maybe	 I	 was reading	more	into	what	he	was	saying	than	was	actually	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	that’s	a	possibility.	I	mean,	you	did	say,	Harvey,	that	Sheriff	Mason had	been	really	discreet	about	the	umbrella.	Maybe	the	murderer	thinks	it’s	still here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 shuddered.	 “Glory,	 I	 hope	 not.”	 I	 pondered	 installing	 a	 second	 alarm system. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stephen	reached	over	and	patted	my	hand.	“They	moved	the	box	inside.	This</p>
<p class="calibre1">time,	when	someone	breaks	in,	we’ll	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	time	WHEN	someone	breaks	in	.	.	.	”	I	could	hear	the	panic	in	my	own</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice,	 but	 then	 laughed	 when	 I	 saw	 the	 smirk	 on	 my	 friend’s	 face.	 “Stephen Murphy,	you	are	the	worst.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	thank	you,”	he	said	with	a	little	bow.	“But	seriously,	a	person	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	to	be	pretty	stupid	to	try	to	get	in	here	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	he	was	right,	but	then,	the	murderer	had	stabbed	a	deputy	sheriff	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">death	in	the	same	place	they’d	killed	Stevensmith.	I	started	to	giggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	gave	me	a	puzzled	look.	“Care	to	share	with	the	class?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 I	 started	 thinking	 about	 one	 of	 my	 favorite	 shows	 of	 all	 time,  <i class="calibre4">Buffy,</i> <i class="calibre4">The	 Vampire	 Slayer</i>,	 and	 how	 all	 these	 bad	 things	 happened	 at	 Sunnyvale because	there	was	a	portal	to	hell	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 entire	 group	 broke	 into	 laughter,	 and	 it	 felt	 like	 the	 weight	 of	 the	 day lifted	a	little.	After	a	moment	I	said	with	fake	seriousness,	“So	that’s	a	no	to	the hell	portal	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stephen	 reached	 over	 and	 patted	 my	 knee.	 “That’s	 a	 no.	 But	 if	 Willow shows,	tell	me.	I	love	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	got	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	all	walked	back	to	our	house	together,	and	then	quietly	and	without	a	hint</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	teasing,	Mart,	Stephen,	and	Walter	went	inside	taking	Mayhem	with	them.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned	to	Daniel	and	found	his	face	soft	with	worry.	“You	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	a	deep	breath	and	gave	myself	a	minute	to	really	think	about	it.	“I	am. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dinner	and	a	good	laugh	helped.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a><img src="index-93_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	glad.	Be	careful,	though,	Harvey,	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	“I	will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	gave	me	another	soft	kiss,	and	I	slipped	inside,	not	quite	as	elated	as	the night	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 WOKE	 SLOWLY	 on	 Sunday	 morning	 after	 a	 sleep	 so	 deep	 I	 wasn’t	 sure	 I’d moved	at	all.	My	body	ached	in	that	delightful	way	it	does	after	a	good	rest,	and I	 stretched	 hard	 as	 I	 headed	 into	 the	 kitchen.	 My	 good	 mood	 immediately dropped	 when	 I	 saw	 my	 friends’	 faces.	 Mart	 was	 actually	 pale,	 which	 never happened	given	her	love	of	a	sunny	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	gestured	toward	a	bar	stool	and	then	spun	the	newspaper	to	face	me.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">headline	 read,	 “Local	 Bookshop	 Becomes	 Locus	 for	 Killing	 Spree.”	 I	 gasped and	then	started	to	cry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 not	 such	 a	 bad	 article,	 honey,”	 Walter	 said	 as	 he	 came	 behind	 me	 to massage	my	shoulders.	“Just	a	really	atrocious	headline.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	it’s	just	the	 <i class="calibre4">Courier</i>.	Everyone	here	already	knows	about	the	murders.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart’s	voice	was	breathless	with	desperate	reassurance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wiped	my	eyes	with	a	napkin	and	leaned	back	with	the	paper	in	front	of	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walter	 was	 right.	 The	 article	 wasn’t	 that	 bad.	 In	 fact,	 they	 said	 a	 lot	 of	 good things	about	the	store.	The	title	wouldn’t	hurt	the	store,	I	knew.	But	the	idea	that a	place	I	had	created	was	associated	with	all	this	violent	death	really	hurt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Laying	the	paper	on	the	counter,	I	stood	and	got	a	cup	of	coffee	for	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	I	turned	to	my	friends	and	said,	“Time	to	get	to	work.	We	have	a	lot	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wear	comfortable	walking	shoes.”	Then	I	turned	and	headed	to	my	room,	coffee</p>
<p class="calibre1">mug	in	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 all	 convened	 thirty	 minutes	 later	 in	 the	 foyer.	 My	 friends	 had	 no	 idea what	 I	 was	 thinking,	 but	 they’d	 all	 put	 on	 sneakers	 and	 were	 ready.	 I	 bent	 and put	 on	 Mayhem’s	 brightest	 bowtie	 –	 she	 had	 one	 for	 each	 season	 and	 holiday thanks	to	Mart	and	her	dog	attire	spree	of	2017.	Then,	I	looked	at	my	friends	and said,	 “It’s	 time	 to	 give	 people	 a	 new	 association	 with	 our	 bookstore.	 No	 more</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>‘Locus	for	a	killing	spree’	for	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alrighty	 then.	 What’s	 the	 plan?”	 Stephen	 asked	 as	 he	 donned	 a	 bright	 red ball	 cap.	 “Handing	 out	 Rice	 Krispies	 treats?	 Hiring	 a	 pep	 band?”	 He	 gasped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Giving	away	books?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled.	“All	good	ideas,	but	no.	We’re	going	to	solve	this	murder,	but	first, we’re	going	to	throw	a	party.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 needed	 to	 lift	 the	 mood	 in	 St.	 Marin’s	 –	 I	 needed	 to	 lift	 the	 mood,	 and everyone	 loved	 a	 good	 street	 fair.	 So	 we	 spent	 the	 day	 planning	 for	 the	 first annual	 Leap	 Into	 Spring	 Street	 Fair	 for	 the	 following	 Sunday.	 A	 week	 wasn’t much	time	to	plan	an	event,	but	by	the	end	of	Sunday,	we’d	gotten	most	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">merchants	 on	 Main	 Street	 to	 agree	 to	 have	 a	 sale	 or	 giveaway	 table	 on	 the sidewalk	in	front	of	their	shops,	convinced	the	local	restaurants	to	offer	a	special spring	 dish	 on	 their	 menus,	 secured	 commitments	 from	 three	 of	 Baltimore’s favorite	 food	 trucks	 to	 come	 out	 for	 the	 day,	 and	 sent	 press	 releases	 to	 all	 the local	 media.	 We	 were	 billing	 the	 day	 as	 a	 “Celebration	 for	 the	 Life	 of	 Deputy Skye	Williams.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 the	 shop	 closed	 after	 a	 mediocre	 sales	 day	 –	 only	 the	 true	 crime enthusiasts	seemed	excited	by	shopping	at	“murder	central,”	as	one	customer	put it	–	I	was	still	feeling	pretty	good	about	the	plan	for	the	following	weekend.	But I	was	also	more	determined	than	ever	to	solve	this	murder.	I	wanted	the	sheriff	to be	able	to	announce	he’d	made	an	arrest	at	the	festival.	Of	course,	I	hadn’t	told anyone	 that	 –	 it	 seemed	 a	 ridiculous	 goal,	 but	 still,	 when	 I	 put	 my	 mind	 to something,	I	was	hard	to	stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 we	 closed	 up,	 I	 sent	 Mart,	 Stephen,	 and	 Walter	 home	 after	 assuring them	 that	 Daniel	 would	 be	 there	 in	 a	 few	 minutes	 to	 walk	 me	 home.	 I	 had	 to show	 them	 his	 text	 message	 saying	 just	 that	 and	 lock	 the	 door	 while	 they watched	 before	 they	 would	 leave.	 But	 finally,	 I	 had	 a	 few	 minutes	 to	 myself.	 I loved	 my	 friends,	 but	 I	 was	 worn	 down	 by	 constant	 people.	 My	 little	 introvert heart	needed	just	a	few	moments	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Plus,	I	wanted	to	take	a	look	behind	the	shop	right	quick	because	something</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 been	 bugging	 me	 since	 the	 day	 before,	 and	 I	 needed	 to	 see	 the	 parking	 lot now	 that	 it	 was	 almost	 dark.	 I	 could	 almost	 hear	 Daniel	 scold	 me	 as	 I	 pushed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>open	the	back	door,	but	I	had	Mayhem	on	her	leash	and	a	hammer	in	my	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 walked	 out	 into	 the	 lot	 a	 ways	 after	 taking	 a	 good	 look	 to	 be	 sure	 I	 was alone.	 I	 could	 see	 clear	 to	 the	 tree	 line	 that	 ran	 beside	 the	 houses	 on	 the	 block over,	and	all	the	way	down	the	street,	the	lights	on	the	back	of	the	shops	showed an	empty	back	alley.	No	one	in	sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning	to	face	the	building,	I	studied	the	back	of	my	store.	It	looked	like	the back	of	a	gas	station,	except	that	the	doorways	for	what	used	to	be	the	outdoor bathrooms	–	one	for	men	and	one	for	women	–	were	closed	off	from	the	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	would	have	opened	into	the	bathrooms	inside	if	they	worked,	but	I	didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">love	the	idea	of	customers	having	to	go	around	the	building	to,	well,	“go.”	So	I’d had	 the	 contractors	 move	 the	 doors	 inside	 and	 close	 these	 off.	 But	 when	 we’d been	back	here	looking	for	the	knife,	I’d	noticed	that	the	left-hand	door	looked dingy	and	had	made	a	mental	note	to	paint	it	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 fact	 that	 one	 door	 had	 gotten	 dirty	 and	 the	 other	 hadn’t	 bugged	 me, though,	and	I	wanted	to	see	if	there	was	a	problem	with	the	gutter	or	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	got	closer,	and	that’s	when	I	noticed	the	smell.  <i class="calibre4">Oregano? </i>	No,	sage.	I	knew	that smell	from	almost	every	shop	in	the	Haight	in	San	Francisco.	It	was	the	scent	du jour	of	the	wellness	community,	but	I	had	never	cared	for	it	much	since	it	was	so deeply	appropriative	to	take	a	Native	American	ritual	and	use	it	to	make	a	store smell	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	got	closer	and	saw	a	pile	of	ash	on	the	ground	by	the	door.	Someone	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	burning	sage?	Presumably	they	thought	the	place	had	bad	energy	and	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	smudging	the	doorway,	but	who?	And	why?	And	for	how	long?	Something</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	been	burned	here	a	lot	to	turn	that	door	a	slightly	gray	hue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	almost	certain	that	I	was	smelling	sage,	but	I	couldn’t	be	sure.  <i class="calibre4">I	need	to</i> <i class="calibre4">get	a	sample	and	have	it	analyzed, </i>	I	thought	and	then	immediately	wondered	if that	was	even	a	thing	investigators	did	or	just	a	result	of	my	deep	affection	for TV	 police	 procedurals.  <i class="calibre4">Better	 safe	 than	 sorry</i>.	 I	 dug	 into	 my	 back	 pocket	 and pulled	 out	 a	 candy	 wrapper	 that	 I’d	 shoved	 there	 earlier.	 I	 was	 always	 putting trash	in	my	pockets	–	a	gum	wrapper	someone	had	dropped	in	the	store,	a	bottle top	on	the	sidewalk	–	and	it	drove	Mart	crazy	when	she	did	laundry.	“Ooh,	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t	 know	 where	 that’s	 been,	 and	 you	 put	 it	 in	 your	 clothing.”	 I	 always</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>shrugged.	Now,	I	had	good	reason	for	my	trash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	a	quick	look	around	to	be	sure	I	was	still	alone	and	then	set	down	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hammer.	Then,	I	used	the	tip	of	my	pinky	finger	to	scoot	a	little	of	the	ash	into the	 wrapper	 and	 twisted	 it	 shut	 before	 carefully	 sliding	 the	 filled	 wrapper	 into my	front	pocket.	I	scooped	up	the	hammer	and	made	my	way	over	to	the	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">door.	I	slammed	it	shut,	dropped	the	safety	bar	into	place,	and	stood	stock-still, listening	 to	 be	 sure	 no	 one	 was	 on	 the	 other	 side	 of	 the	 door.	 I	 didn’t	 hear anything,	so	I	let	out	a	long	sigh	and	headed	toward	the	front	of	the	store. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayhem,	however,	didn’t	follow.	She	stood	staring	at	the	back	door	until	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">knock	at	the	window	signaled	Daniel	and	Taco’s	arrival.	Only	then,	did	she	join me	 by	 the	 alarm	 box	 and	 then	 lead	 me	 out	 the	 front	 door.	 I	 appreciated	 her vigilance,	 but	 I	 hoped	 it	 was	 just	 over-caution	 and	 not	 a	 response	 to	 someone outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	headed	down	Main	Street,	I	told	Daniel	about	the	back	door	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ash	 I’d	 found.	 I	 wanted	 to	 be	 annoyed	 that	 he	 was	 more	 concerned	 about	 me being	behind	the	shop	alone	than	he	was	curious	about	the	ash,	but	I	couldn’t	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	just	made	me	want	to	smile	to	see	his	concern,	but	I	figured	grinning	away	as he	expressed	that	feeling	probably	wasn’t	the	best	idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 decided	 we	 should	 probably	 let	 the	 sheriff	 know	 about	 the	 door	 right away,	just	in	case,	so	after	I	texted	Mart	to	let	her	know	we’d	be	a	bit	late	AND</p>
<p class="calibre1">answered	her	call	when	she	confirmed	I	wasn’t	texting	under	duress	AND	let	her hear	 Daniel’s	 voice	 to	 triple	 check,	 we	 walked	 over	 to	 Mason’s	 office.	 I	 didn’t know	 if	 he’d	 be	 there,	 but	 I	 figured	 I	 could	 leave	 a	 note	 and	 the	 wrapper	 –</p>
<p class="calibre1">preferably	 transferred	 to	 something	 a	 little	 more	 secure	 –	 with	 the	 officer	 on duty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	we	didn’t	even	need	the	note.	The	sheriff	was	the	officer	on	duty	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">night,	a	fact	that	made	me	like	him	more.	I	always	respected	a	person	who	did	all the	things	they	required	the	people	who	worked	for	them	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	I	explained	about	the	door	and	endured	a	less	pleasant	lecture	not	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	the	risk	I	had	taken	to	gather	the	evidence	but	also	about	how	there	were trained	police	officers	in	town	that	had	phones,	Mason	took	the	wrapper,	poured the	 contents	 into	 an	 evidence	 bag,	 and	 then	 said,	 “This	 makes	 things	 more</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>interesting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	does?”	I	sat	forward	on	the	edge	of	the	hard,	plastic	chair	next	to	his	desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Slow	 down,	 Cowgirl,”	 Mason	 said.	 “Did	 you	 not	 hear	 me	 about	 trained investigators?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	back	and	rested	my	hands	on	my	knees.	“I	did,	but	can	I	help	it	if	I’m	a naturally	curious	person?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	 and	 the	 sheriff	 exchanged	 a	 look	 that	 said,	 “So	 that’s	 what	 she	 calls it,”	before	the	sheriff	turned	to	me.	“I	expect	if	I	don’t	tell	you,	you’ll	be	back	at the	 library	 looking	 through	 microfilm	 again.	 Oh,	 you	 thought	 I	 didn’t	 know about	that,	huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	cleared	my	throat.	“I	guess	there	are	no	secrets	in	this	town.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	 when	 the	 new	 woman	 is	 poking	 her	 nose	 into	 a	 murder	 investigation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nope,	 no	 secrets	 then.”	 He	 gave	 me	 a	 stern	 look	 down	 his	 nose.	 “Anyway,	 we found	a	similar	pile	of	ash	over	at	the	courthouse.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	the	courthouse?”	Daniel	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	not	in	there,	but	by	the	old	“colored”	bathrooms	outside.”	The	corners</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	his	mouth	turned	down	hard	when	he	said	 <i class="calibre4">colored</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	man.	I	grew	up	in	the	South,	but	I’ll	never	get	used	to	the	fact	that	black people	had	to	use	separate	facilities.”	I	looked	at	the	sheriff.	“I’m	so	sorry.	Is	that hard	for	you	to	think	about?”	I	felt	naïve	asking	that	question,	but	to	talk	about segregation	with	a	black	man	and	not	at	least	acknowledge	that	this	history	was his	parents’	reality	felt	ridiculous,	not	to	mention	racist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	used	to	be.	Still	is	if	I	think	about	it	too	much.	But	it	was	the	way	it	was, so	I	just	work	with	that.”	He	looked	at	me	then.	“Thanks	for	asking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	 problem.	 But	 this	 was	 found	 at	 the	 colored	 restrooms?	 The	 men’s room?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep,	same	as	at	your	place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 tilted	 my	 head.	 “Really?	 Were	 the	 bathrooms	 at	 the	 gas	 station	 for	 black people?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	sat	back	then.	“Oh,	you	didn’t	know?	Oh	yeah,	that	station	was	owned	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	black	family,	the	Hudsons.	It	was	even	in	 <i class="calibre4">The	Green	Book</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>I	 knew	  <i class="calibre4">The	 Green	 Book</i>	 –	 that	 little	 booklet	 that	 told	 African	 American people	where	they	could	safely	sleep,	eat,	and	shop	as	they	traveled	through	the segregated	 South.	 They’d	 made	 that	 movie	 with	 Mahershala	 Ali	 and	 Viggo Mortenson	and	used	the	book’s	name	as	the	title.	A	lot	of	people	loved	that	film; It	 even	 won	 the	 Oscar,	 but	 when	 I’d	 seen	 it	 at	 a	 theater	 in	 Oakland,	 the conversation	in	the	lobby	afterward	wasn’t	so	flattering.	One	woman	said,	“Just what	 we	 needed,	 another	 movie	 about	 white	 people	 saving	 us.”	 I’d	 liked	 the movie,	but	what	that	woman	said	stuck	with	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	it	wasn’t	the	film	that	Mason	was	talking	about	–	it	was	the	actual	book, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 I	 was	 surprised.	 “It	 was?	 Wow.”	 I	 sat	 quietly	 for	 a	 moment,	 pondering	 the history	of	my	little	shop’s	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mason	furrowed	his	brow.	“Does	that	bother	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?!	Oh,	no.	I	love	that	actually.	I	like	that	it	was	a	safe	space	for	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	just	thinking	about	what	it	must	have	been	like	to	need	to	consult	a	book	to be	able	to	know	you	were	safe.	I	mean,	I	get	the	idea	of	safe	spaces	because	as	a woman	I	think	about	that	stuff.	I	don’t	go	into	a	parking	garage	alone	at	night, for	example—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you	will	go	into	a	dark	parking	lot	where	two	murders	have	happened</p>
<p class="calibre1">alone.”	Daniel’s	tone	was	playful,	but	he	had	a	point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gave	him	a	gentle	smile.	“You’re	right.	But	I	guess	I’m	saying	I	understand</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 experience	 of	 feeling	 unsafe	 sometimes,	 but	 never	 to	 that	 level.	 Never	 so much	that	I	had	to	know	which	towns	I	could	drive	in	at	night	and	which	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sundown	Towns,	where	I’d	be	in	danger	if	I	was	there	after	dark.”	In	one	of	the local	history	books	I’d	read	when	I	first	moved	to	St.	Marin’s,	I’d	read	about	an island	a	bit	further	down	the	shore,	where	black	people	couldn’t	visit	after	dark for	fear	of	their	lives.	The	book	had	called	it	a	Sundown	Town,	and	I’d	learned about	another	facet	of	racism	I’d	never	been	taught. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 I’m	 glad	 you	 like	 knowing	 that	 history,	 Harvey,	 but	 it	 does	 beg	 the question,	why	be	burning	sage	at	the	door	to	two	bathrooms	that	historically	only black	men	used?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	That	was	a	good	question,	and	I	was	eager	to	try	and	find	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a><img src="index-99_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">WE	LEFT	the	sheriff’s	office	and	had	to	wake	up	Mayhem	and	Taco	where	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">snoozed	 by	 the	 bike	 rack	 out	 front.	 As	 we	 walked	 home,	 I	 ran	 through	 my thoughts	out	loud.	I	had	always	been	a	verbal	processor,	and	so	things	really	only became	 clear	 to	 me	 when	 I	 talked	 through	 them.	 It	 was	 a	 habit	 both	 of	 my parents,	who	believed	firmly	that	personal	problems	needed	to	remain	so	private that	 they	 weren’t	 even	 shared	 with	 family,	 despised.	 Mom	 would	 pick	 me	 up after	school	and	ask	how	my	day	was,	but	when	I	began	to	tell	her	about	the	girl on	the	playground	who	had	told	me	to	“mind	my	own	beeswax”	when	I’d	asked</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	she	was	doing	or	some	such	thing,	Mom	would	say,	“Now,	dear,	we	don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">need	 to	 relive	 all	 the	 hard	 moments	 do	 we?	 What	 would	 you	 like	 for	 dinner?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	just	like	that,	the	conversation	would	be	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel,	however,	didn’t	seem	to	mind	at	all.	In	fact,	he	was	listening	intently enough	that	when	I	started	talking	about	how	awful	it	must	have	been	to	have	to wait	for	a	bathroom	that	might	be	hundreds	of	miles	off,	he	told	me	a	story	about an	 older	 man	 from	 St.	 Marin’s	 whose	 parents	 had	 once	 had	 to	 drive	 the	 entire length	 of	 the	 Eastern	 Shore,	 from	 Cape	 Charles,	 Virginia,	 to	 St.	 Marin’s	 –	 a distance	 of	 over	 150	 miles	 –	 with	 him	 as	 a	 toddler	 who	 had	 to	 go	 to	 the bathroom	 because	 they’d	 forgotten	 their	  <i class="calibre4">Green	 Book</i>	 and	 didn’t	 know	 where	 it was	safe	to	stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	“People	can	be	absolutely	horrible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	nodded.	“Yes.	Yes,	we	can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a><b class="calibre3">8</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	morning,	almost	as	soon	as	I	got	the	shop	open,	the	phone</p>
<p class="calibre1">started	ringing.	I	cringed	every	time,	thinking	it	was	going	to	be	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">reporter	 who	 wanted	 to	 write	 a	 story	 on	 “murder	 central.”	 But	 each</p>
<p class="calibre1">time,	it	was	someone	inquiring	about	the	street	fair	and	often	asking	if	there	was a	fund	set	up	for	Deputy	Williams’	family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	glad	that	the	sheriff’s	office	had	established	a	scholarship	fund	in	her honor.	She	wasn’t	married	and	didn’t	have	children,	and	the	town	was	covering</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	funeral	expenses,	so	this	was	a	great	way	to	honor	her	memory	and	give	her a	new	legacy	in	the	community.	One	local	high	schooler	who	wanted	to	go	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">law	 enforcement	 would	 receive	 a	 scholarship	 for	 training	 each	 year.	 By	 the sound	of	the	callers,	that	fund	was	going	to	be	set	for	a	long	time	to	come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walter	and	Stephen	came	by	on	their	way	to	BWI	for	their	flight	just	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">noon,	and	I	gave	them	both	huge	hugs.	“Thank	you	so	much	for	coming.	I	wish</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	could	stay	longer,	see	how	the	street	fair	goes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Us,	too,	but	work	calls,”	Stephen	said	with	a	frown.	“I’m	so	glad	we	got	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	you	in	 <i class="calibre4">your	shop</i>,	my	friend.	Now,	be	safe,	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walter	put	an	arm	around	my	shoulders.	“No	sleuthing	without	help.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wrapped	my	arms	around	his	waist	and	squeezed.	“Agreed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	walked	them	to	the	door,	I	said,	“Text	me	when	you	land,	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	sure	about	that?”	Stephen	asked.	“It’ll	be	late.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sure.”	I’d	always	wanted	my	parents	to	ask	that	of	me,	so	I	tried	to	ask</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>it	of	friends	when	they	travelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 watched	 them	 load	 their	 bags	 into	 the	 waiting	 Uber	 and	 brushed	 away	 a tear.	Rocky	sidled	up	to	me	and	slid	a	hot	cup	of	Earl	Grey	into	my	hands.	The warm	smell	of	bergamot	soothed	me,	and	when	I	took	a	sip,	it	was	hot	–	but	not scalding	 –	 with	 lots	 of	 milk	 and	 sugar,	 just	 as	 I	 liked	 it.	 “Thank	 you,”	 I whispered	as	I	leaned	my	head	on	her	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 stood	 quietly	 like	 that,	 looking	 out	 at	 the	 overcast	 day.	 It	 was	 a	 perfect reading	day,	and	I	hoped	that	would	mean	we’d	have	some	customers.	But	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">meantime,	I	had	work	to	do.	I	gave	Rocky	a	kiss	on	the	cheek	and	said	thank	you before	heading	to	the	counter	to	figure	out	what	exactly	I	could	have	on	hand	for the	weekend’s	activities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Throughout	the	afternoon,	the	flow	of	customers	was	quiet	but	steady,	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">lots	 of	 folks	 picking	 up	 stacks	 of	 books	 and	 magazines	 and	 enjoying	 the	 café tables.	Some	booksellers	hated	that	practice	because	it	meant	books	got	stained and	grungy	and	that	there’d	be	a	lot	of	clean-up.	But	personally,	I	loved	it.	While I	needed	to	make	money,	for	sure,	I	also	just	loved	when	people	read,	and	if	that meant	they	camped	out	at	a	table	for	two	hours	with	 <i class="calibre4">Garden	and	Gun</i>	and	a	copy of	  <i class="calibre4">Into	 Great	 Silence</i>,	 I	 was	 fine	 with	 that.	 Plus,	 they	 almost	 always	 bought something,	 and	 the	 most	 conscientious	 folks	 purchased	 anything	 they	 got	 a crumb	on.	I	appreciated	the	courtesy	even	if	I	didn’t	require	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	 they	 read,	 I	 decided	 to	 order	 a	 bunch	 of	 children’s	 books	 –	 some picture	books,	some	board	books,	some	easy	readers,	some	chapter	books	–	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	do	a	“mystery	book	buy”	for	the	street	festival.	I’d	wrap	the	books	in	brown paper	and	let	the	kids	pick	any	book	they	wanted	from	a	bin	for	their	age	group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 books	 would	 be	 two	 dollars,	 but	 you	 had	 to	 keep	 what	 you	 got	 or	 find another	 kid	 to	 swap	 with.	 I	 figured	 this	 would	 cover	 my	 costs	 but	 give	 some families	who	might	not	be	able	to	get	books	a	chance	to	pick	some	up	.	.	.	and maybe	it’d	even	be	a	social	thing	for	the	kids,	too,	like	a	less	heartless	version	of that	holiday	gift	exchange	where	you	get	to	steal	the	gift	you	want	most. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	checked	in	about	a	billion	times	throughout	the	day,	and	even	Stephen</p>
<p class="calibre1">dropped	 a	 text	 from	 the	 airport	 to	 remind	 me	 to	 “use	 the	 buddy	 system	 when sleuthing.”	My	friends	cared	.	.	.	and	they	were	annoying. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>I	knew	Daniel	was	planning	on	meeting	me	at	the	shop	at	closing,	so	when the	bell	chimed	as	I	was	counting	out	the	register,	I	expected	to	look	up	and	see him.	 Instead,	 Max	 Davies	 was	 there.	 He	 had	 the	 studied	 stance	 of	 someone trying	to	look	casual,	one	foot	out	to	the	side,	a	book	in	his	hands.	But	he	kept cutting	his	eyes	over	to	me,	and	as	soon	as	I	got	to	a	stopping	place,	I	closed	the register	drawer	and	said,	“Well,	hello,	Max.	Nice	to	see	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	hi,	Harvey,”	he	said,	“I	didn’t	see	you	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wanted	to	roll	my	eyes,	but	I	restrained	myself.	“Well,	here	I	am.	What	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	do	for	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 put	 down	 the	 book	 –	 a	 copy	 of	 Michelle	 Obama’s	  <i class="calibre4">Becoming	 </i>–	 and walked	over.	“Since	you	asked	.	.	.	I	was	wondering	if	you	could	help	me	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	for	the	street	festival.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 was	 surprised.	 Max	 hadn’t	 replied	 to	 my	 query	 of	 merchants	 on	 Main Street,	 so	 I	 figured	 he	 had	 chosen	 not	 to	 participate.	 This	 visit	 had	 just	 gotten much	more	positive	than	his	last	one.	“Sure,	what	can	I	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can	call	it	off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stepped	back	a	bit.	“What?!	Why?”	My	hopes	for	a	good	conversation	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">dashed.	I	was	back	to	finding	the	man	annoying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	 there’s	 a	 murderer	 on	 the	 loose,	 and	 you’re	 asking	 everyone	 to stand	around	out	in	the	middle	of	all	those	people.	We’ll	be	sitting	ducks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	take	the	opportunity	to	note	that	he	had	just	walked	into	my	store	on a	 quiet	 Monday	 night	 when	 almost	 no	 one	 was	 around	 and	 that	 if	 the	 killer wanted	to	get	him,	they’d	probably	do	so	as	he	left.	It	didn’t	feel	kind	to	point out	the	obvious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pointed	toward	the	café	and	trailed	behind	Max	just	slowly	enough	to	text</p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel,	tell	him	to	come	on	in	but	be	discreet.	“Max	is	here	to	talk	me	out	of	the fair.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel’s	response	was	perfect.	“Oh	glory!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Max	 took	 a	 seat	 by	 the	 window	 –	 another	 perfect	 opportunity	 for	 the murderer	to	take	him	out,	I	thought	–	and	proceeded	to	tell	me	how	it	just	wasn’t prudent	to	draw	us	all	out	in	the	open	like	that.	“It’ll	be	the	perfect	opportunity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 had	 to	 stifle	 a	 giggle	 when	 I	 remembered	 how	 a	 group	 of	 my	 college</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>friends	had	come	home	to	Chesapeake	City	with	me	and	been	terrified	that	an	ax murderer	would	find	us	out	on	the	secluded	road	to	my	family	home.	“There	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	 street	 lights,”	 my	 friend	 from	 Long	 Island	 had	 said.	 I	 had	 tried	 to	 point	 out that	the	chances	of	a	murderer	being	around	were	far	greater	in	a	crowd,	but	their fear	–	like	all	fear	–	wasn’t	based	in	logic.	So	they	spent	the	weekend	with	every light	in	the	house	on	so	they’d	see	the	ax	murderer	when	he	came	for	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	 Max	 had	 the	 opposite	 fear	 –	 that	 the	 murderer	 would	 find	 it	 easier	 to kill	someone	in	a	crowd.	I	let	out	a	long	slow	breath	to	steady	my	thoughts.	“I see	your	point.	But	what	makes	you	think	the	murderer	will	strike	again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These	things	always	happen	in	threes,”	he	said	without	any	sense	of	irony</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	shame.	“We’ve	had	two	murders.	We’re	just	waiting	for	the	third.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	heard	the	bell	tinkle	and	saw	Daniel	and	Taco	come	in	quietly	and	take	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">seat	 in	 the	 chair-and-a-half	 by	 the	 fiction	 section,	 close	 enough	 to	 hear	 but	 not close	enough	to	intrude. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	 I	 have	 heard	 that	 theory	 about	 tragedy,”	 I	 said,	 drawing	 my	 attention back	 to	 Max.	 “But	 if	 that’s	 the	 case,	 wouldn’t	 the	 murderer	 want	 to	 act	 more quickly,	get	it	over	with	rather	than	waiting	another	week?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 did	 not	 show	 me	 the	 courtesy	 of	 trying	 to	 restrain	 his	 eye	 roll.	 “Serial killers	work	on	a	schedule,	Harvey.”	He	gave	an	exaggerated	glance	around	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shop.	“For	someone	who	runs	a	bookshop,	you	aren’t	very	well	informed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 swallowed	 hard,	 gave	 Daniel	 a	 discreet	 raised	 eyebrow	 over	 Max’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulder,	and	said,	“I	hadn’t	realized	the	person	who	killed	Ms.	Stevensmith	and Ms.	Williams	was	a	serial	killer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	let	out	a	long	sigh.	“Clearly,	the	killer	has	a	type.	Two	women.	Both	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	forties.	Both	in	public	roles.”	He	paused	and	looked	at	the	wall	above	and behind	my	head.	“But	now	that	I	say	that,	I	realize	I	need	not	worry.	I’m	not	the killer’s	type.”	He	stood	up.	“I’m	sorry	to	have	taken	your	time,	Harvey.	Carry	on with	the	street	fair.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 spun	 on	 a	 heel	 and	 headed	 toward	 the	 front	 door	 without	 giving	 Daniel even	a	nod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 soon	 as	 the	 bell	 rang,	 Daniel	 guffawed	 with	 such	 exuberance	 that	 I thought	his	belly	must	hurt	from	holding	that	in.	“Someone’s	been	watching	too</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a><img src="index-104_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">much	 <i class="calibre4">Criminal	Minds</i>,”	he	said	as	soon	as	he	stopped	laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	grinned.	“Clearly,	I	need	to	spend	more	time	in	my	True	Crime	section	lest</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 ignorance	 of	 serial	 killer	 practices	 lead	 me	 astray	 into	 planning	 more fundraisers	in	my	folly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still	laughing,	I	gave	Daniel’s	arm	a	squeeze	as	I	passed	by	him	to	grab	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">coat	and	set	the	alarm.	Then,	we	headed	out	into	the	cool	air	of	a	spring	evening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 SPENT	 the	 next	 morning	 arranging	 the	 new	 books	 on	 the	 front	 table.	 New release	day	was	quickly	becoming	my	favorite	day	of	the	week.	I	loved	all	those new	covers,	and	the	smell	–	all	fresh	wood	and	ink.	It	always	took	me	back	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	construction	sites	in	my	childhood	neighborhood.	Ours	was	one	of	the	first houses	built,	but	soon,	new	homes	were	going	up	everywhere.	I	spent	many	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">afternoon	climbing	around	on	second	floors	that	just	had	the	studs	up	for	walls and	savoring	the	smell	of	all	that	fresh	timber. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cate	 and	 Henri,	 the	 weaver	 from	 the	 co-op,	 came	 by	 mid-day	 and	 brought the	 most	 amazing	 curry	 soup	 –	 sweet	 potatoes,	 coconut	 milk,	 and	 just	 enough heat	 to	 make	 my	 nose	 tingle.	 I	 ate	 three	 bowls.	 We	 sat	 on	 stools	 behind	 the register	 and	 gobbled	 down	 the	 goodness.	 Henri	 had	 just	 started	 a	 catering business,	and	she	had	asked	Cate	to	help	her	find	people	to	sample	her	wares.	I told	the	stellar	cook	that	if	everything	was	this	good,	I’d	sample	anything	.	.	.	and use	her	to	cater	bookstore	events	once	I	had	more	cash	flow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	love	that,”	Henri	said.	“Plus,	I	know	Rocky	and	her	mom	Phoebe	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">church.	 Maybe	 we	 could	 coordinate	 together	 –	 they	 do	 the	 sweets,	 I	 do	 the savories.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	getting	hungry	all	over	again	at	just	the	thought.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alright,	back	to	work	with	me.	Thanks	for	being	a	taste	tester,	Harvey.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	 <i class="calibre4">you</i>.	Come	by	anytime,	especially	if	you	bring	snacks.”	Henri	waved as	she	headed	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cate	 helped	 me	 clean	 up	 the	 lunch	 trash	 and	 said,	 “I	 have	 to	 admit,	 I	 had another	motive	for	stopping	by.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>“You’re	looking	for	the	friends	and	family	bookstore	discount?”	I	looked	at her	out	of	the	corner	of	my	eye	as	we	tucked	our	stools	back	against	the	counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	no,	but	let’s	come	back	to	that,”	she	chuckled.	“Actually,	it’s	about	the murders.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,”	I	said.	“Most	things	are	these	days.	What’s	up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	was	in	Elle	Heron’s	stand	the	other	day	to	pick	up	some	roses	Lucas</p>
<p class="calibre1">needed	for	a	museum	event.	Elle	had	gone	into	the	back	to	get	the	flowers,	and	I was	 just	 standing	 around	 by	 the	 counter.	 I	 happened	 to	 notice	 a	 stack	 of newspapers,	 so	 I	 picked	 up	 the	 top	 one.	 It	 was	 from	 a	 few	 years	 ago,	 which	 I thought	was	odd.	Who	keeps	old	newspapers?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 nodded.	 I	 knew	 a	 few	 people,	 but	 their	 houses	 kind	 of	 looked	 like	 those mazes	they	force	mice	to	run	through	in	laboratories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	got	curious,	so	I	rifled	through	the	rest	of	the	papers.	All	of	them	were	old, some	of	them	from	a	decade	ago.	I	couldn’t	stop	myself,	and	I	flipped	through	a few	of	the	papers.	You	won’t	believe	what	I	found?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	baby	otter?	No,	wait,	the	secret	for	turning	lead	into	gold?	No,	wait,	this has	to	be	it	–	articles?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cate	snickered.	“Alright,	smarty	pants.	Yes,	articles.	But	the	interesting	part was	which	ones	were	highlighted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ah,	now	I	was	interested.	“Which	ones?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Every	article	by	Lucia	Stevensmith.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Every	 article?	 That’s	 a	 lot	 of	 articles.	 The	 woman	 was	 verbose	 to	 say	 the least.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep,	 pretty	 much	 an	 article	 on	 every	 page	 had	 one	 or	 more	 headings highlighted	in	yellow.”	Cate	sounded	pleased	with	herself,	and	I	couldn’t	blame her.	This	was	very	intriguing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anything	else	you	noticed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope,	 Elle	 came	 back,	 and	 I	 didn’t	 want	 to	 get	 caught.”	 She	 paused.	 “I don’t	really	know	why.	It	just	felt	like	she	might	be	embarrassed	for	someone	to be	snooping	through	her	papers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 nodded.	 “Right,	 especially	 when	 you’ve	 marked	 every	 article	 a	 murdered woman	ever	wrote.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a><img src="index-106_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,	right?	That’s	why	it	seemed	a	little	suspicious	to	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 wasn’t	 sure	  <i class="calibre4">suspicious</i>	 is	 the	 word	 I’d	 use,	 but	 it	 was	 definitely	 odd	 and worth	further	exploration.	“Thanks,	Cate.	I	appreciate	you	telling	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Think	I	should	tell	the	sheriff?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 you	 found	 some	 old	 newspapers	 with	 articles	 highlighted?	 Nah.	 I’ll look	into	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harvey.”	 Her	 voice	 was	 low	 and	 foreboding.	 “What	 about	 being	 careful? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stephen	and	Walter	made	me	promise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 tried	 to	 give	 my	 most	 innocent	 look	 by	 batting	 my	 eyelashes.	 “I’m	 not doing	anything	dangerous,	just	going	to	talk	to	another	storeowner.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cate	 squinted	 at	 me.	 “Sure.	 Sure.”	 She	 picked	 up	 her	 purse.	 “Want	 to	 go now?	I	actually	need	to	get	more	baby’s	breath,	so	it’s	a	great	excuse.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 took	 a	 look	 around	 the	 store.	 A	 couple	 of	 browsers,	 but	 nothing	 Rocky couldn’t	 handle.	 I	 ran	 over	 to	 the	 café	 and	 checked	 to	 be	 sure	 she	 was	 okay	 to manage	things	for	a	bit,	got	her	okay,	and	rushed	back.	“I	have	thirty	minutes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	not	dawdle	then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">ELLE’S	STAND	smelled	like	chrysanthemums.	It	was	a	smell	I	loved,	even	though</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 resented	 the	 flowers	 themselves	 a	 bit.	 In	 high	 school,	 secret	 admirers	 always gave	out	mums	on	Valentine’s	Day.	I’d	never	gotten	a	single	flower.	It	was	easier to	blame	the	bloom	than	the	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 back,”	 Elle	 said	 as	 she	 came	 out	 from	 the	 cooler.	 “Forget</p>
<p class="calibre1">something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cate	stepped	to	the	counter.	“Actually	yes.	I	need	more	baby’s	breath.	Right</p>
<p class="calibre1">now,	 we	 look	 like	 we’re	 throwing	 a	 proposal	 party	 in	 the	 museum	 conference room.	I	need	to	lighten	the	intensity	a	bit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	then	I	don’t	know	if	baby’s	breath	is	the	way	to	go.	Too	much	like	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">boutonniere.”	 Elle	 put	 her	 hands	 behind	 her	 head	 and	 looked	 up	 at	 the	 ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	if	you	did	small	daisies	instead?	I	just	got	a	big	bunch	in,	and	they’re	not only	pretty	but	they’re	cheap.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>“Perfect,”	 Cate	 said.	 “Harvey,	 do	 you	 want	 something	 for	 the	 store?”	 She kicked	me	in	the	shin	as	she	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um,	what?	Oh	yeah,	for	the	street	fair	actually.	I	mean,	I	don’t	want	to	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	 your	 sales	 territory	 or	 anything,	 but	 I	 did	 think	 I’d	 put	 some	 small	 vases around	the	shop	and	café	for	Sunday.	Have	anything	that	would	work?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmmm.	You’re	thinking	about	using	those	antique	bottles	you	used	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">grand	opening,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	memory,”	I	said.	I’d	collected	old	bottles	from	junk	stores	for	weeks</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 then	 used	 them	 as	 vases	 for	 the	 shop.	 Unique	 and	 cheap.	 “Yeah,	 so something	that	looks	good	with	a	short	stem.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	suppose	dandelions	won’t	work,”	she	said	with	a	grin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	opposed,	but	I’d	rather	not	have	everyone	blowing	seeds	around	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shop	on	day	three.	Way	too	much	sweeping	for	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fair	 enough.”	 She	 tapped	 a	 finger	 against	 the	 clear	 frame	 of	 her	 glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	hyacinths?	Totally	seasonal,	very	hardy,	perfect	size.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	love	it.	Maybe	forty	to	fifty	stems?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	got	it.	I’ll	bring	them	over	Saturday	if	that	suits.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	started	to	head	back	to	get	Cate’s	daisies,	but	before	she	went,	I	said,	“So these	murders,	huh?”	I	felt	like	a	bonehead	–	how	obvious	could	I	be?	–	but	it was	the	best	I	could	do	on	the	spur	of	the	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cate	 wandered	 off	 to	 look	 at	 the	 arrangements	 in	 the	 cooler,	 presumably	 to take	 away	 a	 bit	 of	 the	 pressure	 and	 make	 it	 seem	 less	 like	 I	 was	 interrogating Elle.	I	was	grateful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gracious.	 Just	 awful.”	 She	 pressed	 both	 hands	 down	 on	 the	 counter.	 “I know	that	everyone	says	this,	but	I	can’t	believe	someone	was	murdered	in	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">town.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	I	couldn’t	believe	it	either.	Somehow	it	had	been	easier	to	take	in	a murder	 in	 San	 Francisco.	 Not	 easy,	 of	 course,	 but	 easier.	 I	 guess	 I	 expected	 it more	there.	“Tell	me	about	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	head	jutted	up.	“Oh,	and	it	happened	in	your	shop.	Here	I	am	thinking</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	 the	 reputation	 of	 our	 town,	 and	 you	 had	 a	 murder	 happen	 in	 your	 new store.	How	awful!”	She	came	around	the	counter	then.	“How	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>I	 felt	 tears	 threaten,	 but	 I	 didn’t	 think	 I’d	 get	 much	 information	 if	 I	 was crying.	 “It’s	 been	 a	 hard	 couple	 of	 weeks,	 to	 be	 honest.	 But	 the	 shop	 is	 doing well	in	spite	of	everything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 gave	 my	 arm	 a	 squeeze.	 “Maybe	 in	 part	 because	 of	 everything.”	 She winced.	“Is	that	an	awful	thing	to	say?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	laughed	softly.	“No,	it’s	not	awful.	It’s	the	truth.	The	“no	press	is	bad	press” </p>
<p class="calibre1">rule	certainly	applies	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	counter	was	filled	with	buckets	of	daylilies,	and	I	ran	my	fingers	lightly over	the	petals.	“What’s	got	me	puzzled,”	I	said,	“is	why	Stevensmith?	I	mean</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	wasn’t	very	likable,	but	what	had	she	done	to	make	someone	mad	enough	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">murder	her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elle’s	 face	 went	 blank,	 and	 she	 looked	 down	 at	 the	 floor	 before	 quickly collecting	 herself	 and	 giving	 an	 exaggerated	 shrug.	 “That’s	 a	 good	 question.	 I expect	 whoever	 did	 it	 felt	 like	 they	 had	 a	 good	 reason	 –	 either	 that	 or	 it	 was	 a crime	of	passion.	I	mean,	she	made	a	lot	of	people	angry,	including	our	neighbor Max.	Either	way,”	she	said	as	she	stepped	back	behind	the	counter,	“I’m	sure	the sheriff	 will	 sort	 it	 all	 out.	 I’m	 just	 sad	 the	 murderer	 wasn’t	 caught	 before	 Skye was	killed.	That	was	such	a	tragedy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	let	out	a	hard	sigh	and	went	into	the	back	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	deputy’s	murder	was	a	tragedy,	but	not	Stevensmith’s?”	Cate	asked	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	slid	back	over	beside	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	didn’t	say	that.”	I	felt	like	I	needed	to	defend	Elle	for	some	reason,	but even	I	had	to	admit	that	she	wasn’t	exactly	giving	off	the	“completely	innocent” </p>
<p class="calibre1">vibe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	didn’t	have	to	say	it.”	Cate	gave	me	a	look	that	said,	if	it	quacks	like	a duck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eleanor	 came	 back	 from	 the	 storeroom	 with	 an	 armload	 of	 small-petaled daisies.	They	were	beautiful	and	seemed	like	the	perfect	emblem	of	spring.	They would	definitely	lower	the	intensity	of	Cate’s	roses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cate	 paid,	 and	 we	 thanked	 Elle	 and	 made	 plans	 for	 her	 to	 come	 by	 on Saturday	 afternoon	 to	 drop	 off	 the	 flowers.	 Except	 for	 that	 whole	 suspicion	 of murder	thing,	it	would	have	been	a	lovely	visit	with	a	neighbor. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a><img src="index-109_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">BACK	 AT	 THE	 SHOP,	 things	 had	 gotten	 much	 busier	 in	 the	 twenty-five	 minutes we’d	 been	 gone,	 and	 I	 could	 see	 the	 look	 of	 relief	 on	 Rocky’s	 face	 when	 we came	in.	She	had	a	line	at	the	café	counter	and	was	just	ringing	up	a	big	sale	at the	book	register.	“I’ve	got	this,”	I	said	as	I	slid	in	beside	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you.	The	 need	for	caffeine	 was	getting	palpable,”	 she	whispered	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	jogged	out	from	behind	the	counter	toward	the	café. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 laughed	 and	 continued	 ringing	 up	 the	 man	 in	 front	 of	 me.	 His	 selections were	fascinating.	Most	men	stick	to	the	supposedly	“male”	genres	like	thrillers and	 spy	 fiction,	 military	 history,	 maybe	 a	 bit	 of	 literary	 fiction	 as	 long	 as	 the main	characters	are	men.	But	this	guy	was	buying	a	stack	of	cozy	mysteries	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 of	 my	 favorites:	 Mollie	 Cox	 Bryan,	 Maggie	 Sefton,	 and	 Millie	 Jordan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lots	of	murder	here,”	I	said	with	an	ironic	wink. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Well,	just	when	I	needed	to	restock	my	supply	for	the	week</i>,	I	thought.	“What better	 place	 to	 come	 than	 the	 bookstore	 that	 was	 the	 scene	 of	 the	 crime?”	 He gave	me	a	tentative	smile.	“I	hope	that	doesn’t	bother	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	 at	 all.”	 I	 was	 surprised	 I	 meant	 that	 when	 I	 said	 it.	 “We’re	 just	 glad people	are	finding	us.	I	love	a	lot	of	these	books,	but	I	hope	you	don’t	mind	me saying	that	I	don’t	find	many	men	who	read	cozy	mysteries.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shrugged.	“Yeah,	I	know.	I’m	an	anomaly,	but	since	my	wife	died,	I	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">want	to	read	books	that	capture	my	attention,	let	me	feel	like	I’m	among	friends, and	give	me	a	chuckle	at	the	sleuth’s	complete	inability	to	walk	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	felt	color	run	up	my	neck.	He’d	pegged	me	pretty	well.	I	managed	to	choke</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	my	embarrassment	and	say,	“Well,	if	you	ever	need	recommendations—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I’ll	be	back.	I	went	with	some	favorite	authors	here,	but	I	saw	a	couple</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	writers	I	don’t	know	yet.	Maybe	you	can	point	me	toward	some	great	books</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	I	come	next	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	love	that.	I’m	Harvey,	by	the	way.	I	own	the	shop.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Galen	Gilbert.	Nice	to	meet	you.	I	have	decided	that	I’ll	make	St.	Marin’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	Tuesday	outing	–	I	have	one	for	each	day	of	the	week	just	so	that	I	don’t	get to	be	too	much	of	a	homebody	–	so	I’ll	see	you	in	a	week.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a><img src="index-110_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	watched	the	small,	gray-haired,	white	man	as	he	made	his	way	out	the	front</p>
<p class="calibre1">door.	A	customer	like	that	was	why	I	was	in	business.	I	knew	books	could	save</p>
<p class="calibre1">people’s	lives	–	keep	them	from	deep	heartbreak	like	the	loss	of	a	partner	–	and	I immediately	started	musing	on	what	cozy	mysteries	to	recommend	next.	Maybe</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	British? </p>
<p class="calibre1">THAT	NIGHT,	I	went	home	exhausted.	Daniel	and	Taco	walked	Mayhem	and	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">home	as	usual,	but	when	we	got	to	the	door,	I	put	my	hand	on	his	chest	when	he leaned	down	to	give	me	his	single	kiss.	“Let’s	hold	that	thought,”	I	smiled	at	the shock	 and	 then	 the	 sadness	 in	 his	 eyes.	 “Want	 to	 come	 in,	 eat	 a	 huge	 bowl	 of peanut	 butter	 popcorn,	 and	 then	 complain	 about	 our	 aching	 bellies	 while	 we binge	watch	 <i class="calibre4">Game	of	Thrones</i>?  <i class="calibre4">	</i> I’ve	never	seen	it,	and	I	hear	it’s	best	if	I	not	go in	 alone.”	 The	 events	 of	 the	 past	 ten	 days	 had	 finally	 caught	 up	 with	 me,	 and Mart	was	away.	I	didn’t	feel	like	doing	anything	strenuous	like	cooking	a	meal, but	I	did	feel	like	spending	more	time	with	Daniel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	took	my	keys	and	unlocked	the	door.	“After	you,	Madame.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peanut	 butter	 popcorn	 is	 one	 of	 those	 foods	 that	 the	 world	 needs	 to	 know about.	It’s	a	really	simple	thing	to	make	–	just	honey	(or	corn	syrup	if	you	must), sugar,	 peanut	 butter,	 and	 vanilla	 all	 mixed	 together	 and	 poured	 over	 popcorn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	only	problem	with	is	that	it	is	possible	–	but	not	advisable	–	to	eat	an	entire bowl	by	oneself.	This	was	my	other	motivation	for	inviting	Daniel	in.	I’d	been thinking	 about	 this	 popcorn	 all	 day,	 and	 if	 he	 shared,	 at	 least	 I	 wouldn’t	 make myself	too	sick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 mixed	 the	 peanut	 butter	 sauce	 while	 he	 used	 the	 air	 popper	 to	 make	 the popcorn	and	fed	Taco	and	Mayhem.	They	would	have	been	content	with	popcorn</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	dinner,	too,	but	we	opted	for	kibble	instead.	Then,	he	watched	as	I	dumped the	popcorn	into	a	super-big	metal	bowl	and	then	poured	the	peanut	butter	sauce over	top,	stirring	carefully	enough	to	get	sauce	on	most	of	the	kernels	but	not	so carefully	that	we’d	miss	out	on	the	goodness	of	extra	sauce	at	the	bottom	of	the bowl.	“That’s	the	best	part,”	I	told	him	as	I	explained	my	strategy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>We	sat	cross-legged	on	the	sofa,	our	knees	touching	and	the	bowl	of	popcorn wedged	 between	 us,	 and	 I	 felt	 myself	 completely	 relax	 for	 the	 first	 time	 in weeks.	 Daniel	 loved	 the	 popcorn,	 and	 the	 twenty	 minutes	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Game	 of	 Thrones</i> that	I	saw	before	I	fell	asleep	looked	pretty	intriguing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	woke	up	the	next	morning,	I	was	under	my	favorite	quilt	–	the	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	usually	graced	my	bed,	Mayhem	and	Taco	were	on	the	floor	beside	me,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	had	left	a	note	on	the	coffee	table.	“Dear	Harvey,	I	didn’t	want	to	wake you.	You	needed	the	rest,	but	I	did	take	the	popcorn.	I	will	return	the	bowl	when I	bring	your	keys	to	the	shop	at	9:30.	I	left	Taco	behind	because	he	and	Mayhem make	a	good	guard	duty	pair,	and	also,	I	didn’t	want	to	carry	him	home.	See	you soon.	xo” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	up	and	stretched	and	smiled.	This	guy,	this	one	was	a	keeper. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a><b class="calibre3">9</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	hadn’t	stayed	long	when	he’d	dropped	off	the	completely	empty</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 washed	 popcorn	 bowl	 and	 my	 keys,	 but	 it	 was	 still	 nice	 to	 start the	 day	 seeing	 him.	 I	 wasn’t	 sure	 what	 to	 make	 of	 the	 fact	 that	 he watched	three	episodes	of	 <i class="calibre4">Game	of	Thrones</i>	without	me	and	now	had	to	–	by	my demand	–	wait	for	me	to	catch	up	with	him,	but	I	figured	I’d	forgive	him,	by	oh, say,	noon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	spent	the	first	part	of	my	morning	swapping	the	display	of	Westerns	I	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	with	a	new	display	of	True	Crime	books,	featuring	my	favorite	title,  <i class="calibre4">Shot</i> <i class="calibre4">in	 the	 Heart</i>	 by	 Mikal	 Gilmore.	 I	 knew	 we	 had	 a	 number	 of	 loyal	 readers	 for Westerns,	but	I	needed	to	be	wise	and	go	with	what	All	Booked	Up	was	known</p>
<p class="calibre1">for,	 and	 right	 now,	 that	 was	 crime.	 So	 True	 Crime	 got	 the	 coveted	 face-out shelves	just	behind	the	new	release	tables.	I	knew	where	my	bread	was	buttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 was	 just	 about	 to	 head	 out	 to	 the	 taco	 truck	 and	 get	 Rocky	 and	 me	 some lunch	 when	 Divina	 Stevensmith	 came	 through	 the	 front	 door.	 After	 our	 last conversation	and	her	odd	reaction	to	the	color	orange,	I	felt	the	impulse	to	run around	 and	 tug	 all	 the	 books	 with	 orange	 covers	 off	 the	 shelves,	 but	 I	 resisted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 all,	 she	 just	 said	 she	 didn’t	 like	 the	 color;	 she	 didn’t	 say	 it	 made	 her homicidal	or	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	tiny	woman	was	wearing	a	polka	dot	jumpsuit	that	reminded	me	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rain	coat	she’d	been	wearing	that	first	time	I	saw	her,	and	I	wondered	if	she	had a	 penchant	 for	 the	 whimsical	 print.	 I	 was	 on	 my	 way	 to	 ask	 her	 that	 very</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>question	 as	 a	 casual	 conversation	 starter	 when	 she	 made	 an	 abrupt	 turn	 away from	the	self-help	section	that	she’d	been	browsing	and	walked	straight	toward me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	mentally	braced	myself	for	what	looked	like	it	might	be	a	dressing	down, </p>
<p class="calibre1">given	 her	 forceful	 march	 in	 my	 direction,	 but	 when	 she	 reached	 me,	 she	 said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you	for	what	you’re	doing	for	Deputy	Williams	and	the	town.”	Her	voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	quiet	and	steady.	“That	poor	woman.	She	didn’t	deserve	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ms.	 Stevensmith	 was	 twisting	 a	 bright	 blue	 scarf	 in	 her	 hands,	 and	 she looked	on	the	verge	of	tears.	I	came	around	the	counter	and	pointed	to	a	pair	of club	chairs	by	the	art	books.	“Want	to	sit?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 gave	 a	 small	 nod	 and	 lowered	 herself	 smoothly	 into	 the	 nearest	 chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next	to	her,	I	looked	a	bit	like	a	cow	trying	to	use	furniture,	but	I	tried	to	focus on	her	nervousness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	a	sad	thing,	her	death,	especially	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded,	scarf	still	twisting.	“And	I’m	sorry	you	have	been	affected,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	your	new	shop	and	all.	What	terrible	timing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 looked	 around	 the	 shop.	 “Well,	 if	 it	 hadn’t	 happened	 here,	 it	 probably would	have	happened	somewhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 eyes	 darted	 to	 meet	 mine.	 “I	 don’t	 know	 about	 that.	 I	 mean,	 there’s something	about	this	space,	don’t	you	think?”	She	stood	up	and	spun	in	a	circle as	if	trying	to	see	the	whole	shop.	“There’s	a	lot	of	history	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	about	what	the	sheriff	had	told	me	about	 <i class="calibre4">The	Green	Book</i>	and	this building	when	it	was	a	gas	station.	Ms.	Stevensmith	was	easily	in	her	eighties, very	much	someone	who	had	grown	up	in	the	Jim	Crow	South.	“You	knew	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">building	when	it	was	a	gas	station?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Knew	it?	Harvey,	my	husband	owned	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	dropped	my	chin	to	look	at	her	through	the	tops	of	my	eyes.	“I’m	confused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	the	man	who	owned	the	gas	station	was	black.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	grinned.	“He	was.”	She	took	a	deep	breath	and	looked	at	me	closely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	 but,	 forgive	 me	 for	 asking,	 but	 wasn’t	 Lucia	 white?	 Not	 biracial,	 I mean?”	Conversations	around	race	were	always	so	hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	you’re	right,	not	that	everyone	who	has	mixed-race	ancestry	shows	it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a>the	way	we	think	they	would,	of	course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded,	although	that	was	news	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lucia	 was	 my	 daughter	 from	 my	 second	 marriage.	 Her	 father	 was	 white. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	first	husband,	Berkeley	Hudson,	owned	the	gas	station.”	She	sat	down	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	at	me.	“He	was	black.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	heard	that	the	station	was	in	 <i class="calibre4">The	Green	Book</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	.	.	.	although	a	few	places	in	there	were	owned	by	white	people,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 most	 were	 black-owned.	 Berkeley’s	 was	 one	 of	 them.”	 She	 smiled	 and seemed	 to	 slide	 back	 into	 her	 memories.	 “Lots	 of	 people	 came	 through	 here when	they	were	on	their	way	from	New	York	or	Philly	and	headed	to	Norfolk	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	places	in	the	South.	No	I-95	then,	you	know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hadn’t	known,	but	I	loved	trivia	like	that.	“Anyone	famous?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	my,	yes.	John	Lee	Hooker	stopped	once,	ended	up	having	dinner	with	us</p>
<p class="calibre1">because	there	wasn’t	anywhere	else	to	eat	until	you	got	to	Norfolk.	I	couldn’t	get him	to	play	for	us,	but	he	was	mighty	nice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	met	John	Lee	Hooker?”	I	was	tempted	to	get	up	and	put	his	music	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	speakers	right	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	gave	me	a	soft	grin.	“I	did.	My	favorite	guest,	though,	Richard	Wright</p>
<p class="calibre1">—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 couldn’t	 help	 myself	 and	 interrupted	 her.	 “Richard	 Wright	 stopped	 in	 St. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marin’s.	What?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	fan	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	could	say	that.	I’ve	read	 <i class="calibre4">Native	Son</i>	maybe	twenty	times.	He’s	one	of the	best	American	writers	in	history.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	a	big	fan	of	meatloaf,”	she	said	with	a	smirk,	“With	extra	ketchup.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No?!	Really?	I	love	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 got	 quiet	 then	 and	 folded	 her	 hands	 around	 her	 scarf.	 “It	 was	 an important	 place,	 this	 gas	 station.	 A	 haven	 for	 a	 lot	 of	 folks	 who	 just	 needed somewhere	to	stop	and	rest	before	heading	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	put	a	hand	on	her	knee.	“It	was	kind	of	you	to	open	your	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	 too	 kind.”	 She	 stood	 up	 and	 looked	 toward	 the	 back	 of	 the	 store. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyway,”	she	said	with	a	little	shake	of	her	head,	“I’m	glad	you	own	this	place, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a><img src="index-115_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">Ms.	 Beckett.	 It	 seems	 like	 you	 appreciate	 the	 stories	 –	 both	 the	 ones	 in	 the	 air and	the	ones	on	the	page	–	that	live	in	these	walls.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 felt	 like	 I	 was	 not	 getting	 the	 whole	 picture	 here,	 but	 she	 was	 clearly moving	our	conversation	along,	so	I	didn’t	push.	“Thank	you,	Ms.	Stevensmith.	I really	 appreciate	 that.”	 I	 took	 a	 few	 steps	 back	 toward	 the	 counter.	 “Was	 there something	I	could	help	you	with?	Something	you	needed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	yes,	I	almost	forgot.	I’d	like	to	donate	a	piece	to	auction	off	at	the	street fair	with	all	proceeds	going	to	the	scholarship	fund	in	honor	of	Deputy	Williams, if	that	might	be	alright	with	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alright	 with	 me?	 Of	 course.	 That’s	 lovely.	 Can	 you	 get	 me	 a	 bit	 of information	about	the	piece,	and	I’ll	get	the	word	out	to	the	press?	I’m	sure	this will	bring	some	folks	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	handed	me	a	small	sheet	of	paper	covered	in	neat	handwriting.	“I	took</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 liberty	 of	 anticipating	 that	 request	 and	 made	 some	 notes	 here.	 Just	 let	 me know	if	you	need	anything	further.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	glanced	down	at	the	paper	and	saw	she’d	written:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Divina	Stevensmith	–	1938-</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Study	of	St.	Marin’s	at	Nightfall</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Paper	Collage</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">8’	x	12.5’</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Valued	at	$25,000</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“OH	MY	WORD,	Ms.	Stevensmith.	This	is	too	generous.	I	had	no	idea—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	idea	my	work	was	worth	that	much?”	She	smiled	demurely.	“I	hope	I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	overvaluing	my	art,	but	I	sold	a	piece	that	size	last	week	for	a	little	more	than that.	 So	 I	 hope	 that’s	 fair,	 but	 feel	 free	 to	 lower	 the	 value	 if	 you	 think	 it appropriate.	You’re	welcome	to	come	by	and	see	the	piece	in	my	studio	if	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	help.	And	of	course,	people	don’t	need	to	bid	nearly	that	much—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	of	course	your	work	is	worth	that	much	and	more.	I’m	just	stunned	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	generosity.	Thank	you.”	I	took	a	deep	breath	and	then	leaned	down	to	give</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a>the	 tiny	 woman	 a	 hug.	 “Truly.	 Thank	 you.	 This	 is	 a	 huge	 gift	 in	 Deputy Williams’	honor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	the	least	I	could	do.”	She	gave	my	hand	a	hard	squeeze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	she	started	to	walk	toward	the	door,	I	called	after	her,	“Ms.	Stevensmith, </p>
<p class="calibre1">can	I	ask	a	question?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	turned,	and	I	met	her	near	the	doorway.	“I	mean,	I’m	just	curious.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">color	orange?	You	really	seemed	to	dislike	it.	Is	that	an	artistic	thing?	Something about	the	way	it,	um,	plays	with	other	colors	or	such?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 tiny	 woman	 looked	 me	 dead	 in	 the	 eye	 and	 laughed	 so	 hard	 her shoulders	shook.	“Oh	my,	no.	I’ve	just	seen	way	too	much	of	it	in	my	day.	Lucia loved	 orange	 from	 the	 time	 she	 was	 a	 little	 girl.	 She	 wanted	 her	 room	 painted orange,	 always	 wore	 orange	 clothes,	 even	 now	 –	 er,	 until	 she	 died	 –	 she	 took notes	on	orange	paper.	I	just	got	tired	of	it,	you	know,	the	way	you	get	tired	of	a food	if	you	eat	it	all	the	time,	even	if	you	loved	it	once.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	 thank	 you.	 I	 totally	 get	 it.	 Sometime,	 I’ll	 tell	 you	 about	 my	 small overaffection-turned-distaste	 for	 Reese’s	 peanut	 butter	 cups.	 Thanks	 for	 telling me.	I	had	been	curious.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	placed	her	hand	on	my	shoulder.	“Seems	like	you’re	curious	about	a	lot, </p>
<p class="calibre1">my	dear.”	Then,	she	turned	and	walked	out	the	door	with	a	little	wave	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	window	as	she	went	down	Main	Street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shivered	as	I	sat	back	down	in	the	chair	by	the	art	books	and	texted	Mart	to explain	the	orange	thing	and	the	gift. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	wise	friend	wrote	back	immediately.	“You	better	Google	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right.	On	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 knew	 I	 was	 in	 for	 a	 surprise	 when	 Google	 auto	 filled	  <i class="calibre4">Divina	 Stevensmith</i> after	I’d	typed	simply	 <i class="calibre4">Divina. </i>	A	quick	scan	of	the	listings	showed	she	had	pieces in	 galleries	 from	 coast	 to	 coast,	 including	 one	 of	 my	 favorites	 in	 Sausalito, California.	 She’s	 had	 exhibitions	 at	 the	 MOMA	 in	 New	 York,	 and	 she	 had	 a permanent	gallery	down	in	Salisbury.	She	was	a	big	deal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 scrolled	 through	 a	 few	 listings,	 looking	 for	 anything	 I	 could	 about	 her personal	life.	I	felt	kind	of	nosy,	but	I	couldn’t	help	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Twenty	minutes	later,	though,	and	I	still	knew	almost	nothing	about	her.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a><img src="index-117_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">had	been	born	in	Baltimore	in	1938	and	lived	in	rural	Maryland.	That’s	all	any site	 listed.	 She	 and	 her	 agent	 –	 the	 only	 person	 I	 could	 find	 any	 contact information	for	when	it	came	to	her	work	–	kept	a	tight	lid	on	her	private	life.	I respected	 that	 and	 was	 impressed.	 In	 this	 social	 media	 age,	 it	 took	 a	 special prowess	to	stay	out	of	the	headlines,	even	if	you	weren’t	a	famous	artist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	SPENT	the	rest	of	the	afternoon	sending	a	second	round	of	press	releases	about the	art	auction	in	between	ringing	up	the	customers	who	came	in.	Cate	got	Ms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stevensmith’s	 permission	 to	 take	 a	 photo	 of	 a	 corner	 of	 the	 piece	 she	 was donating	so	that	I	could	put	it	on	the	impromptu	webpage	I’d	created	for	the	fair on	our	store	website.	I	also	added	a	contact	form	with	the	hopes	that	most	of	the requests	for	more	information	would	come	through	email	since	I	much	preferred</p>
<p class="calibre1">email	 to	 the	 phone.	 Finally,	 I	 altered	 the	 store	 voicemail	 to	 give	 a	 bit	 of background	about	the	street	fair	and	the	silent	auction	and	pointed	callers	to	the website. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 I	 braced	 myself	 for	 the	 onslaught	 of	 calls	 .	 .	 .	 that	 never	 came.	 All through	Wednesday	evening	and	into	Thursday	morning,	the	phone	rang	only	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">couple	of	times	with	people	looking	to	order	particular	books.	Normally,	I	would have	 been	 thrilled	 to	 have	 orders	 coming	 in,	 but	 in	 this	 situation,	 I	 was	 just disappointed.	I	had	thought	Divina	Stevensmith’s	donation	would	cause	a	buzz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	an	effort	to	distract	myself	and	lift	my	mood,	I	texted	Cate	late	Thursday</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning	and	asked	if	she	wanted	to	get	lunch.	Mart	was	in	town	and	had	offered to	come	cover	the	shop	for	me	so	that	I	could	get	a	break.	She	knew	I	was	sad</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 the	 news	 of	 the	 auction	 hadn’t	 caused	 more	 of	 a	 stir.	 While	 we	 had	 eaten frozen	pizza	and	drunk	boxed	wine	the	night	before,	she’d	said,	“Tomorrow,	I’m coming	 in	 and	 working	 the	 register	 so	 you	 can	 get	 things	 prepped	 for	 the weekend	 and	 –	 and	 this	 is	 non-negotiable	 –	 take	 a	 few	 hours	 away	 from	 the store.	 You’ve	 been	 there	 all	 day	 almost	 every	 day	 since	 opening.	 It’s	 time	 you relaxed	for	a	bit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Part	of	me	felt	guilty	–	felt	like	I	should	be	the	one	giving	Mart	some	time</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>off.	She	worked	so	hard,	and	she	was	supporting	me	financially	at	the	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	then,	she	reminded	me	that	her	job	usually	enjoyed	a	wine	tasting	a	day	in some	of	the	most	beautiful	places	in	the	mid-Atlantic,	and	I	acquiesced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cate	 texted	 back	 immediately	 and	 suggested	 we	 meet	 at	 noon	 at	 Dale’s Seafood	 Shack.	 “Then,	 I’ll	 get	 Lucas	 to	 give	 you	 the	 deluxe	 tour	 of	 the Museum.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	would	be	great.	See	you	there	at	noon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 had	 to	 admit	 that	 Mart	 was	 right.	 I	 really	 did	 need	 a	 little	 time	 away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Between	 the	 work	 to	 get	 the	 shop	 opening,	 the	 first	 few	 days	 of	 business,	 and then	the	two	murders,	I	was	pretty	worn	down.	It	was	too	early	in	my	business</p>
<p class="calibre1">career	 for	 me	 to	 be	 feeling	 that	 way,	 and	 an	 afternoon	 in	 the	 warm	 sun	 of	 a spring	afternoon	seemed	like	just	what	I	needed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dale’s	 Seafood	 Shack	 was	 the	 quintessential	 Eastern	 Shore	 seafood	 place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Very	casual,	but	with	views	of	the	water	that	you’d	pay	a	fortune	for	in	the	city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	 long	 ago	 learned	 that	 just	 because	 I	 didn’t	 eat	 seafood	 didn’t	 mean	 that	 I wouldn’t	 love	 these	 places.	 Cate	 and	 I	 got	 a	 table	 on	 the	 covered	 deck overlooking	 the	 river	 that	 opened	 up	 onto	 the	 Chesapeake	 Bay.	 I	 ordered	 a burger	and	fries	covered	in	Old	Bay,	and	Cate	got	a	crab	cake	covered	in	melted cheese.	 She	 also	 took	 the	 liberty	 of	 ordering	 each	 of	 us	 a	 bottle	 of	 Maryland’s own	Natty	Bo	beer.	The	air	was	still	cool,	so	we	had	the	entire	deck	to	ourselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	perfect	way	to	unwind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	sipped	our	beers,	I	caught	her	up	on	the	history	I’d	learned	about	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">store	building.	“I	never	knew	any	of	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	it	feels	weird	that	such	an	important	piece	of	St.	Marin’s	history	isn’t noted	with	a	marker	or	something.	I’m	definitely	going	to	put	something	up	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	shop	and	maybe	talk	to	the	historical	society.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	plan.	Maybe	we	can	have	something	temporary	printed	for	Saturday, </p>
<p class="calibre1">even	a	one-page	hand-out.	Our	printer	down	in	Salisbury	could	do	something,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">bet.	Send	me	some	text,	and	I’ll	call	him	when	I	get	back	to	the	co-op	later.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	thanks.	That	would	be	perfect.	It’s	the	least	we	can	do	to	honor	Divina’s husband.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly.	Plus,	it	wouldn’t	hurt	as	publicity	for	the	shop	either.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>“True.”	 I	 felt	 my	 concerns	 about	 the	 weekend	 climb	 my	 ribs.	 “Speaking	 of which,	 I	 haven’t	 had	 a	 single	 query	 about	 the	 silent	 auction.	 Don’t	 you	 think that’s	odd?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cate	gave	me	a	mischievous	grin.	“The	ways	of	Divina	have	finally	reached</p>
<p class="calibre1">you.	I	take	it	you	now	know	she’s	kind	of	a	big	deal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kind	of?	She’s	the	biggest	kind	of	deal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly.	I	saw	what	you	put	up	on	your	website	–	well	done	–	but	I’m	sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 agent	 has	 made	 it	 clear	 to	 the	 press	 that	 all	 queries	 are	 to	 go	 through	 her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Information	management.	Divina	has	been	especially	wily	about	not	letting	most of	the	world	know	she	lives	here	in	St.	Marin’s.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	she	has	a	booth	at	the	co-op.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	does.	But	she’s	not	on	our	website,	and	she	doesn’t	let	us	advertise	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">stuff.	 It’s	 kind	 of	 brilliant	 actually.	 When	 people	 who	 know	 her	 work	 stumble upon	 her	 studio,	 they	 are	 elated,	 but	 then,	 she’s	 quick	 to	 draw	 them	 in	 and remind	them	that	her	work	thrives	when	she	has	her	privacy.	So	far,	no	one	has wanted	to	risk	her	art	for	a	bit	of	fame	for	themselves.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gave	Cate	a	skeptical	glance.	“No	one?	Come	on.	Not	a	single	person	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">Instagrammed	her	shop	door	and	tagged	it	as	St.	Marin’s.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	 yet.	 She’s	 a	 persuasive	 woman,	 and	 I	 think	 people	 like	 feeling	 as	 if they’re	part	of	her	inner	circle	somehow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 shook	 my	 head.	 “The	 ways	 of	 celebrity	 will	 never	 make	 sense	 to	 me.”	 I looked	out	over	the	water	and	then	back	at	Cate.	“But	her	gift	is	so	generous.	I can’t	believe	she’d	give	something	that	valuable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	not?”	Cate	said	as	she	shoved	a	fry	into	her	mouth.	“After	all,	she	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">always	 create	 more	 of	 her	 work.	 Plus,	 she	 is	 really	 devoted	 to	 the	 town.	 She’s funded	the	park	over	at	the	other	end	of	Main	Street	from	you.	Paid	for	an	empty lot	to	be	cleaned	up	and	then	for	the	safest,	but	most	fun,	playground	equipment to	be	put	in.	She	is	a	big	supporter	of	the	Museum,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	impressed.	I	liked	a	story	of	generosity	that	didn’t	come	with	a	lot	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">accolades.	Those	gifts	seemed	more	genuine	somehow	than	those	that	came	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	insistence	of	a	name	on	a	building.	I	really	hated	the	way	even	all	the	sports stadiums	 had	 become	 corporate	 marketing	 tools.	 Ravens	 Stadium	 was	 just	 fine</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>with	that	name	.	.	.	but	now	some	bank	paid	to	have	its	logo	on	the	building.	Ick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cate	leaned	forward	a	bit	as	we	finished	up	our	beers.	“Any	more	word	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Elle?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	took	me	a	minute	to	figure	out	what	Cate	meant,	but	then	I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing.	I	haven’t	seen	her	since	we	talked	to	her	a	couple	of	days	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	still	think	she’s	good	for	it.”	Cate	sounded	like	a	detective	from	one	of	the <i class="calibre4">NCIS</i>	franchises,	maybe	that	woman	in	LA	with	the	long	dark	hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe.”	I	didn’t	really	feel	like	hypothesizing	that	my	new	neighbor	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">murderer.	“I	guess	you	never	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 paid	 our	 bill,	 and	 Cate	 texted	 Lucas	 to	 let	 him	 know	 we	 were	 headed over	to	the	museum.	I’d	been	wanting	to	go	there	since	I’d	moved	into	town	five months	earlier,	but	I	had	just	been	too	busy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lucas	met	us	at	the	door	and	gave	us	the	tour	through	all	the	exhibits.	I	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	idea	there	was	such	a	rich	history	of	watermen.	I	loved	looking	at	the	photos of	 the	 old	 timers	 out	 on	 boats	 that	 looked	 barely	 watertight	 but	 that	 brought	 in thousands	and	thousands	of	dollars’	worth	of	some	of	the	world’s	best	seafood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Plus,	 I	 loved	 the	 special	 exhibit	 of	 maritime	 art.	 The	 paintings	 of	 water	 scenes weren’t	quite	as	good	as	the	real	thing,	but	if	you	couldn’t	live	on	the	water,	the best	ones	made	it	feel	like	you	could	taste	the	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next,	Lucas	walked	us	out	to	the	shipyard,	where	local	artisans	were	crafting</p>
<p class="calibre1">–	 with	 old-fashioned	 tools	 –	 a	 traditional	 tall-ship,	 complete	 with	 masts	 carved from	single	pine	trunks.	Just	now,	the	workers	were	hand-hewing	the	planks	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">cover	the	exterior	of	the	ship’s	hull.	It	was	a	laborious	and	grueling	task	to	build each	 ship,	 I	 could	 see	 that,	 and	 it	 made	 me	 want	 to	 watch	 even	 more	 of	 those treasure-hunting	 shows,	 not	 just	 for	 the	 treasure	 now,	 though,	 but	 to	 recover some	of	the	labor	these	people	had	put	into	these	beautiful	vessels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	amazing,	Lucas.	Thank	you	for	the	tour,”	I	said	as	we	headed	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward	the	main	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 pleasure.	 Come	 back	 anytime.	 I’ve	 gotten	 you	 a	 membership,	 so	 just wander	over	when	you	need	a	break.”	He	handed	me	a	little	card	with	my	name</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	it,	and	I	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	my	word.	Thank	you	so	much.	I’ll	be	back	for	sure.	I	need	to	go	see	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a><img src="index-121_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">oyster	shack.”	I	gave	Lucas	a	hug.	“Oh,	and	if	I	send	over	a	list	of	maritime	titles for	the	new	section	I’m	adding	to	the	store,	would	that	be	okay?	I	don’t	want	to impinge	on	the	gift	shop	here,	but	I	would	like	to	honor	this	history	in	the	shop for	 sure.”	 I’d	 been	 resistant	 to	 the	 idea	 of	 going	 too	 “on	 brand”	 for	 the	 store, especially	since	Lucia	Stevensmith	had	made	the	suggestion,	but	now,	it	felt	like I	was	just	honoring	the	stories	of	this	place.	I	liked	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Absolutely.	 Maybe	 we	 can	 even	 do	 an	 event	 together	 sometime?	 You	 sell the	books,	and	we	get	the	ticket	proceeds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ooh,	I	love	that.	Let’s	make	that	plan.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	gave	us	a	hearty	wave	as	we	walked	back	up	to	Main	Street.	Cate	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Soon,	you’re	going	to	have	events	coming	out	your	ears.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually,	I’d	love	that.	Those	kind	of	things	bring	new	people	to	the	store, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 while	 I	 love	 St.	 Marin’s,	 I	 can’t	 sustain	 the	 shop	 on	 the	 number	 of	 books people	here	buy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right.	Well,	this	weekend	should	help	.	.	.	and	it	looks	like	you’ve	got	buy-</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	from	the	other	shops	in	town.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 mind	 flashed	 back	 to	 Max	 Davies’	 and	 his	 weird	 concern	 about</p>
<p class="calibre1">becoming	a	target.	I	told	Cate	about	our	conversation,	still	befuddled	by	his	fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Max	is	an	odd	one,	for	sure.	But	maybe	he’s	afraid	of	something	else.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 turned	 to	 look	 at	 my	 friend	 as	 we	 walked	 into	 the	 street.	 “What	 do	 you mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	mean,	maybe	he’s	afraid	all	those	people	might	suss	out	what	he	did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	chuckled.	“So	now	you	think	Max	Davies	is	the	murderer?	Is	there	anyone</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	don’t	suspect?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	gave	my	hand	a	playful	slap	and	said,	“Well,	you	.	.	.	at	least	not	yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">WHEN	I	GOT	BACK	to	the	shop	that	afternoon,	the	place	was	full	of	people	quietly reading	 or	 sipping	 coffee.	 Mart	 gave	 me	 a	 wave	 from	 the	 register	 as	 I	 came	 in and	 gestured	 toward	 the	 fiction	 section,	 where	 Sheriff	 Mason	 was	 reading	 the back	 cover	 of	 an	 Inspector	 Gamache	 mystery.	 “Didn’t	 take	 you	 for	 a	 police</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>procedural	kind	of	guy,	Sheriff?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know,	I’m	probably	not.	Somehow,	reading	about	a	murder	in	a	small</p>
<p class="calibre1">town	 isn’t	 really	 appealing	 just	 now.”	 He	 carefully	 slid	 the	 book	 back	 into	 its spot	 and	 aligned	 the	 spine	 with	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 shelf.	 “Maybe	 when	 I	 retire though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	 I	 didn’t	 know	 better,	 I’d	 say	 you’d	 worked	 in	 a	 bookstore	 before.”	 I gestured	toward	the	tidy	shelf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right	 about	 now,	 I’d	 take	 the	 quiet	 of	 books,”	 he	 looked	 toward	 the storeroom	door,	“although	it	hasn’t	exactly	been	the	easiest	of	openings	for	you, huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 shrugged.	 “Not	 really,	 I	 guess,	 but	 even	 when	 I	 think	 I	 just	 want	 to recommend	books	and	spend	time	reading,	I	find	that	I	get	into	something	else</p>
<p class="calibre1">anyway.	 This	 time	 that	 something	 else	 just	 found	 me.”	 I	 puffed	 out	 my	 cheeks and	blew	a	long	stream	of	air.	“Did	you	need	something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	wanted	to	give	you	a	quick	update.	But	before	I	tell	you	what	I	know,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">need	you	to	understand	something.	I’m	only	telling	you	all	this	so	that	you	don’t try	to	snoop	it	out	yourself.	I’m	hoping	that	if	I	satisfy	your	curiosity,	you’ll	take a	 step	 back	 and	 just	 let	 us	 do	 our	 jobs.”	 He	 raised	 his	 eyebrows	 and	 looked	 at me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gave	him	a	small	nod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay	then.	We	did	find	Stevensmith’s	hair	on	the	handle	of	the	umbrella,	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	looks	like	it	was	the	murder	weapon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shuddered.	I	had	held	that	handle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Any	fingerprints?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 scrutinized	 my	 face.	 “No.	 Nothing	 usable.	 And	 nothing	 particularly unique	about	the	sage	ash	either.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	shoulders	dropped.	“We’re	no	further	along	than	we	were.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 <i class="calibre4">police</i>	are	no	further	along	than	 <i class="calibre4">we	</i> were,	Harvey.	I	know	you	want	to help,	 but	 you	 are	 not	 a	 part	 of	 this	 investigation.”	 His	 voice	 was	 kind	 but forceful,	and	I	felt	color	run	up	my	neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 sorry.”	 I	 let	 out	 a	 long	 sigh.	 “I	 feel	 kind	 of	 helpless,	 though.	 These people	died	at	my	shop,	and	I	feel	responsible	somehow,	like	I	need	to	do	right</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a><img src="index-123_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 them.”	 I	 slid	 my	 hands	 through	 my	 hair.	 “Plus,	 I’m	 just	 a	 really	 curious person.	My	mom	used	to	say	I	was	a	Nosey	Nellie,	like	that	girl	on	 <i class="calibre4">Little	House</i> <i class="calibre4">on	the	Prairie.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 sheriff	 put	 a	 hand	 softly	 on	 my	 shoulder.	 “I	 wouldn’t	 say	 you’re anything	like	snooty	Nellie	Oleson.	And	curiosity	is	a	good	thing.	But	Harvey,	in this	case,	you	could	be	putting	yourself	in	real	danger.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 knew	 that	 all	 too	 well,	 but	 apparently	 I	 didn’t	 seem	 to	 care.	 I	 did	 care, however,	that	I	not	make	things	harder	for	the	sheriff.	“I	hear	you.	I’ll	stay	out	of things	 and	 just	 share	 information	 that	 might	 come	 to	 me.”	 He	 gave	 me	 a	 stern look.	“You	have	my	word	that	I	won’t	go	looking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 gave	 my	 shoulder	 a	 squeeze	 and	 turned	 toward	 the	 door.	 “Thanks, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harvey.	Glad	you’re	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	waved	as	he	headed	out	to	his	patrol	car.	I	was	glad	I	was	part	of	this	town, too,	but	I’d	be	even	happier	when	 <i class="calibre4">they	</i> caught	the	murderer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">EVEN	 THOUGH	 MART	 was	 there	 to	 walk	 home	 with	 me,	 Daniel	 and	 Taco	 still showed	up	right	on	time	to	join	the	entourage	back	to	the	house.	Daniel	always smelled	just	a	little	bit	like	motor	oil	and	cedar,	and	tonight,	the	odor	was	even stronger.	 Leave	 it	 to	 Mart	 to	 leave	 no	 sensory	 experience	 unnoted.	 “Do	 a	 little slip-sliding	 in	 an	 oil	 slick,	 my	 friend?”	 she	 asked	 as	 she	 slipped	 her	 arm playfully	into	his. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 shrugged,	 but	 I	 saw	 pink	 tinge	 his	 ears.	 “I	 lost	 my	 grip	 on	 an	 oil	 pan under	a	Dodge	1500	and	got	soaked.	Guess	my	shower	with	Lava	soap	didn’t	cut</p>
<p class="calibre1">it,	huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	like	it,”	I	said	quietly	as	I	slipped	my	hand	into	his.	I	saw	the	color	in	his ears	deepen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	chattered	away	while	we	walked,	and	I	loved	it.	She	made	sense	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world	by	talking,	so	I’d	long	ago	learned	she	didn’t	need	–	and	sometimes	didn’t even	want	–	my	responses.	She	was	quite	content	to	fritter	on	while	Daniel	and	I walked	quietly	and	enjoyed	the	cool	evening. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>At	 the	 door,	 Mart	 slipped	 inside	 with	 Mayhem,	 giving	 me	 a	 wink	 as	 she went.	Daniel	and	I	stood	on	the	small	front	stoop	under	the	old-fashioned	barn light	and	just	looked	at	each	other.	“I	could	get	used	to	this,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me,	too.”	Then,	he	leaned	down	and	kissed	me	softly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	a	step	back	to	head	toward	the	house	and	fell	as	Taco’s	long	sausage	of a	body	took	me	out	at	the	knees.	I	landed	with	a	thud	and	just	enough	sense	to catch	my	head	before	it	smacked	the	concrete. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	 knelt	 down	 quickly	 with	 a	 look	 of	 great	 concern	 on	 his	 face.	 My tailbone	 definitely	 hurt,	 and	 I	 suspected	 I’d	 have	 quite	 the	 neck	 ache	 in	 the morning.	But	I	started	to	snicker	and	then	laugh	until	I	was	crying	and	rocking back	and	forth	as	I	tried	to	catch	my	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually	Daniel	sat	down	next	to	me	and	waited	for	me	to	settle.	When	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 talk	 again,	 I	 said,	 “You	 better	 get	 used	 to	 that,	 too.	 I’m	 not	 the	 world’s most	coordinated	person.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me	neither.	Like	my	new	cologne,	Eau	de	Pennzoil?”	Then,	he	laughed	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">hard	his	shoulders	shook. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a><b class="calibre3">10</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I was	right.	My	neck	was	so	stiff	from	my	fall	that	when	I	woke	up,	I	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	 tilt	 my	 head	 but	 not	 turn	 it.	 I’d	 been	 here	 before.	 Too	 many	 hours reading	books	in	awkward	positions	had	led	me	to	stiff	necks	many	times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	recalled	a	tip	that	author	Laraine	Herring	had	shared	at	a	book	reading	for	her novel	 <i class="calibre4">Ghost	Swamp	Blues</i>.	She	said	that	for	a	stiffness,	you	needed	to	move	that body	part	a	hundred	times	in	every	direction.	It	had	worked	for	me	before,	and	I sure	hoped	it	would	work	again.	I	had	a	lot	to	do	and	no	time	to	have	to	rotate my	entire	body	every	time	I	had	to	make	a	turn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	started	by	doing	simple	head	turns	while	I	was	in	the	shower.	The	hot	water</p>
<p class="calibre1">helped,	 and	 by	 the	 time	 I’d	 turned	 a	 hundred	 times	 in	 each	 direction,	 I	 was beginning	to	feel	the	muscles	give.	Then,	while	I	made	Eggo	waffles	–	the	whole wheat	ones	because	I	wasn’t	entirely	a	lost	cause	when	it	came	to	my	health	–	I tried	 to	 put	 my	 ears	 to	 my	 shoulders	 over	 and	 over	 again.	 Then	 I	 did	 forward bends	and	pointed	my	chin	to	the	ceiling.	By	the	time	I	put	on	my	coat	to	head out	 the	 door,	 I	 could	 turn	 to	 call	 Mayhem	 without	 feeling	 like	 someone	 had rammed	a	hot	poker	down	my	back.  <i class="calibre4">Thank	you,	Laraine. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">And	I	was	so	glad	I	could	move	when	I	got	to	work	because	there	was	a	line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 veritable	 LINE	 at	 the	 door	 of	 my	 bookshop.	 Rocky	 was	 standing	 just	 to	 the side	of	the	door	with	what	I	imagined	was	the	same	expression	I	was	wearing	–</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	of	stupefied	glee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Any	idea	what’s	up?”	I	asked	as	I	sidled	up	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>“None.	 But	 I	 didn’t	 want	 to	 go	 in	 without	 you.	 These	 folks	 look,	 um, hungry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 was	 right.	 People	 were	 shifting	 from	 foot	 to	 foot	 and	 looking	 at	 their watches	 over	 and	 over	 again.	 A	 couple	 of	 folks	 were	 scanning	 the	 crowd looking,	presumably,	for	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looped	my	arm	through	Rocky’s	and	said	in	a	deep	voice,	“We’re	going	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	squeezed	my	arm	against	her.	“Aye,	Aye,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 we	 gently	 bumped	 the	 crowd	 out	 of	 the	 way,	 unlocked	 the	 door,	 slid through,	 and	 shut	 it	 tightly	 behind	 us.	 I	 felt	 like	 I	 was	 trying	 to	 keep	 Aslan	 in when	there	was	a	squirrel	in	the	front	yard.	I	almost	had	to	shove	one	woman’s rubber-booted	foot	out	of	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gracious,”	 Rocky	 said	 as	 she	 hurried	 over	 to	 the	 café.	 “I’ll	 get	 the	 extra carafe	going.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	I’m	going	to	do	a	quick	Google	search	to	see	if	I	can	figure	out	what’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	took	a	scan	of	only	the	first	three	results	from	my	search	of	“All	Booked</p>
<p class="calibre1">Up	St.	Marin’s”	to	see	that	the	buzz	had	been	caused	by	a	post	from	our	friend Galen	Gilbert,	who	was	apparently	a	Bookstagrammer	with	a	HUGE	following. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	Wednesday,	he’d	posted	a	picture	of	his	bookstack	that	he’d	picked	up	here</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	shop,	and	then	yesterday,	he’d	featured	a	photo	of	the	shop	with	a	blinking arrow	and	the	words	“Go	HERE	NOW!”	on	it.	I	clicked	over	to	his	profile	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw	 he	 had	 86.7K	 followers.	 I	 was	 dumbfounded.	 He	 seemed	 so	 unassuming, and	 maybe	 that	 was	 his	 charm.	 Whatever	 got	 him	 those	 numbers,	 I	 needed	 to know	his	secrets	.	.	.	and	I	needed	to	thank	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clearly	at	least	a	couple	dozen	of	his	followers	did	exactly	what	he	said,	and here	they	were,	in	the	flesh	and	eager. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	texted	Mart,	who	was	planning	to	head	to	a	local	winery	this	afternoon	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	sleeping	in	this	morning.	“I	need	help.	Big	crowd	at	door.	Come	now!!!!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	reply	came	three	seconds	later.	“Baseball	cap	it	is.	I’ll	text	Daniel	and	be there	in	ten.”	Gracious,	she	was	a	good	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 prepped	 the	 shop,	 got	 the	 thumbs-up	 from	 Rocky,	 and	 opened	 the	 door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,	this	wasn’t	exactly	the	kind	of	frenzy	that	happens	when	they	have	those</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>wedding	dress	sales	at	those	big	New	York	boutiques,	but	for	a	small	bookstore that	had	been	only	open	two	weeks,	one	person	waiting	at	the	door	would	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	a	thrill;	twenty-eight	people	at	the	door	felt	like	a	miracle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 book	 lovers	 filed	 in	 and	 headed	 out	 across	 the	 store.	 I	 could	 see	 that fiction	 was	 a	 big	 hit,	 and	 someone	 went	 right	 to	 our	 small	 drama	 section. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Children’s	books	garnered	a	few	visitors,	and	a	couple	of	folks	went	right	for	the caffeine	 –	 I	 admired	 their	 focus	 and	 did	 the	 same	 quickly	 before	 what	 I	 hoped would	be	a	long	day	of	selling	books. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon,	Mart	arrived	with	Daniel	and	Taco	close	behind.	When	I	saw	the	look</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	relief	on	his	face	as	he	took	note	that	I	was	fine	and	even	smiling,	I	realized that	 Mart	 hadn’t	 explained	 very	 well	 the	 nature	 of	 the	 situation.	 “Sorry	 she scared	you,”	I	said	as	he	leaned	on	the	counter	beside	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	she	said	was	that	you	needed	help.	She	was	practically	jogging	here,	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	figured	it	must	have	been	a	crisis.”	He	looked	around.	“Now	I	see	you	do	need help,	just	not	the	way	I	thought.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 gave	 his	 shoulder	 a	 bump.	 “Mart	 can	 be	 a	 little	 too	 enthusiastic sometimes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	that’s	a	good	quality	in	a	friend.	Glad	you’re	alright.”	He	undid	Taco’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">leash,	 and	 the	 Basset	 headed	 out	 to	 find	 Mayhem,	 who	 had	 already	 staked	 her claim	on	the	big	pillow	by	the	history	section.	“Okay	with	you	if	I	stay	and	help out?	Fridays	are	my	light	days.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure.	But	really?	Fridays	are	light?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep.	Most	of	the	locals	head	out	of	town	for	the	weekend	on	Fridays	if	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t	want	to	manage	the	tourist	traffic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	frowned.	“But	the	tourist	traffic	is	what	keeps	the	town	going.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 absolutely.	 I	 didn’t	 say	 they	 didn’t	 like	 the	 tourists,	 but	 most	 of	 us would	rather	not	be	in	the	crowds	unless	we’re	working.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 guess	 that	 made	 sense.	 After	 all,	 I	 was	 already	 feeling	 a	 little	 possessive about	our	little	community.	I	didn’t	know	if	I	loved	the	idea	of	all	these	outsiders coming	 in	 .	 .	 .	 at	 least	 I	 didn’t	 know	 if	 I	 liked	 that	 personally.	 As	 a	 business woman,	I	loved	the	idea.	“Ah,	yes,	I	get	that.	Well,	today	I’m	working	–	and,	if you’re	serious,	so	are	you.”	He	nodded,	and	I	put	him	to	work.	“Could	you	go</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a><img src="index-128_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">get	 me	 some	 more	 paper	 bags	 from	 the	 storeroom?	 I	 think	 I’m	 going	 to	 need them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	the	initial	inflow,	the	stream	of	customers	into	the	store	hadn’t	let	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 was	 clearly	 our	 busiest	 day	 yet,	 and	 it	 didn’t	 show	 any	 signs	 of	 slowing down.	 I	 handed	 the	 register	 over	 to	 Mart	 and	 began	 a	 sweep	 of	 the	 store	 –</p>
<p class="calibre1">picking	up	forgotten	coffee	mugs	and	reshelving	books	as	fast	I	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	 I	 knew	 it,	 it	 was	 noon,	 and	 Rocky	 was	 swamped	 in	 the	 café.	 I trundled	over	to	help	her,	and	she	pointed	to	the	back	room.	“More	sandwiches</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	fridge	.	.	.	and	bring	all	the	pastries.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	glanced	at	the	case.	It	was	almost	empty.	We	needed	ALL	the	scones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">BY	 MID-AFTERNOON,	 we’d	 found	 a	 rhythm.	 I	 floated,	 answered	 questions,	 and restocked	 the	 bookshelves	 and	 the	 pastry	 case.	 Mart	 ran	 the	 register	 and answered	the	phone	to	take	special	orders,	which	she	jotted	down	on	an	Easter</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bunny	notepad	she’d	unearthed	from	somewhere.	Daniel	helped	carry	boxes	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">books	out	of	the	back	room	and	kept	Mart	in	change	–	even	though	that	required not	just	one,	but	two,	trips	to	the	bank.	It	was	my	biggest	sales	day	yet,	and	I	had Galen	Gilbert	to	thank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 took	 a	 minute	 to	 message	 him	 on	 Instagram.	 “Thank	 you,	 Galen.	 Your message	has	been	a	huge	hit.	Look	at	this.”	Then	I	snapped	a	picture	and	sent	it over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	reply	was	almost	instantaneous.	“Well,	I	know	a	good	thing	when	I	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">it.	There	are	other	ways	besides	murder	to	drum	up	business,	my	dear.	See	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tuesday.”	He’d	followed	his	message	with	a	series	of	winky-face	emojis,	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t	help	but	laugh.	People	are	not	always	what	they	appear	to	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	early	evening,	the	crowd	had	started	to	thin	as	we	suggested	restaurants</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	town	and	even	a	few	places	to	stay.	Folks	who	had	never	been	to	St.	Marin’s before	were	enamored	of	the	place,	and	when	they	heard	about	Sunday’s	Street</p>
<p class="calibre1">Festival,	they	were	loath	to	go	home.	“Why	not	make	a	weekend	of	it?”	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">phrase	I	heard	more	than	once. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>Just	as	we	were	about	to	close,	a	tall,	lean,	black	man	came	into	the	store.	He stood	 just	 inside	 the	 doorway	 for	 a	 long	 time	 and	 looked	 around.	 Something about	the	way	he	studied	the	space	made	me	wonder	if	he	was	remembering,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	of	Berkeley	Hudson	and	his	gas	station. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks	 so	 much	 for	 visiting	 All	 Booked	 Up.	 Can	 I	 help	 you	 find</p>
<p class="calibre1">something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 looked	 down	 at	 me	 and	 blinked	 a	 couple	 of	 times.	 “Oh,	 thank	 you.	 I’m actually	not	here	to	buy	books.	I	hope	that’s	okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled.	“Of	course,	it’s	okay.	Is	there	something	else	I	can	help	you	with?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 gazed	 out	 over	 my	 head	 into	 the	 store.	 “It’s	 just	 good	 to	 see	 the	 place again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Again?	 You’ve	 been	 here	 before?”	 I	 didn’t	 quite	 know	 how	 to	 ask	 about Berkeley	 Hudson	 since	 I	 didn’t	 want	 to	 seem	 like	 the	 dumb	 white	 lady	 who assumed	all	black	people	knew	each	other.	But	I	forged	ahead.	“You	came	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	was	a	gas	station?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiled	down	at	me.	“You	know	about	the	station?	And	about	Berkeley,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">presume?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 nodded.	 “I	 just	 learned	 about	 the	 station	 and	 how	 it	 was	 a	 safe	 haven	 of sorts,	this	building	and	the	Hudson	house	I	mean.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	folded	his	long	frame	and	sat	down	on	the	edge	of	the	window	display. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	granddaughter	sent	me	the	picture	she	got	from	one	of	those	online	things, said	 she	 thought	 it	 was	 the	 gas	 station	 I	 always	 talked	 about.	 Sure	 enough,	 it was.”	He	kept	looking	out	over	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	 you	 told	 your	 granddaughter	 about	 the	 station,	 it	 must	 have	 been important	 to	 you.”	 I	 didn’t	 want	 to	 be	 nosy	 or	 push,	 but	 he	 seemed	 to	 want	 to talk,	to	know	it	was	still	safe	to	share	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	most	important	.	.	.	and	also	the	saddest.”	He	looked	me	in	the	eye	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">raised	one	eyebrow.	“You	know	the	whole	story	of	Berkeley?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um,	probably	not.	I	just	know	he	owned	the	gas	station	and	that	he	and	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">wife	 Divina	 let	 people	 stay	 with	 them	 when	 they	 came	 to	 town.”	 I	 felt	 myself leaning	 forward,	 aching	 to	 know	 everything,	 but	 this	 was	 the	 kind	 of	 curiosity the	sheriff	had	warned	me	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>His	face	softened.	“Ah,	Divina.	What	a	lovely	woman.	She	still	around?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	yes.	Still	here	in	St.	Marin’s	for	sure.	I	expect	she’d	love	to	hear	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	if	you	felt	like	calling	on	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	face	grew	sad	then,	so	sad	that	I	felt	like	crying.	“I’m	not	so	sure	about that.	I	bring	a	whole	lot	of	hard	memories	with	me,	things	she’d	probably	like	to forget.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh.”	 I	 didn’t	 quite	 know	 what	 to	 say	 to	 that,	 so	 I	 just	 let	 the	 silence	 rest there	a	minute.	Finally,	I	said,	“Would	you	like	to	walk	around?	You’re	welcome to	go	wherever	you	wish.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 stood	 up	 and	 walked	 toward	 the	 back	 of	 the	 building,	 then	 turned	 and looked	out	the	front	window.	“The	oil	cans	were	kept	right	there.	And	he	had	a display	of	Michelin	tires	in	that	corner.	A	Pepsi	machine	over	there	.	.	.	and	he always	 kept	 a	 bag	 of	 salted	 peanuts	 so	 we	 could	 all	 drop	 our	 peanuts	 in	 those Pepsi	and	have	us	a	good	ole	snack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Peanuts	in	Pepsi?	Like	 <i class="calibre4">in</i>	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	chuckled.	“Girl,	you	haven’t	lived	until	you’ve	had	that	goodness.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	have	to	take	your	word	for	it.”	I	grinned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 smiling	 as	 he	 looked	 over	 the	 shop,	 but	 then	 that	 sadness	 crossed over	his	features	again.	“The	bathrooms	still	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep.	 In	 the	 same	 place,	 but	 now	 they	 open	 from	 the	 inside	 of	 the	 store. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’re	welcome	to	use—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 ma’am.	 I	 don’t	 need	 to	 go	 in	 that	 room	 no	 way,	 no	 how.	 Thank	 you kindly,	but	no	thank	you.”	He	looked	almost	frightened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 didn’t	 know	 what	 to	 say,	 so	 I	 just	 blurted	 out	 the	 first	 thing	 that	 came	 to mind.	 “I’d	 like	 to	 know	 Berkeley	 Hudson’s	 whole	 story.	 I’d	 like	 to	 honor	 him well	in	this	place.	I’m	Harvey	Beckett.	I	own	the	shop	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	shook	his	hand,	I	noticed	how	soft	his	palms	were	and	how	long	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">fingers.	“Ralph	Sylvester.	I	was	the	last	man	to	see	Berkeley	Hudson	alive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	felt	my	breath	catch	in	my	throat,	and	then	we	made	our	way	back	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">window	display.	“I’m	sorry.	Did	you	say	you	were	the	last	person—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	see	Berkeley	Hudson	alive.	Yes,	I	did.	I	was	there	when	they	murdered</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.	Right	back	there,	in	the	men’s	bathroom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>I	 felt	 faint.	 Another	 murder	 in	 my	 shop.	 “He	 was	 murdered	 here.	 Oh	 my goodness.	When?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“1958.”	His	voice	was	soft,	but	firm.	“The	Klan	got	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sucked	in	my	breath.	“The	Ku	Klux	Klan?	What?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 shrillness	 in	 my	 voice	 drew	 his	 eyes	 to	 mine.	 “Yep,	 they’re	 the	 ones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hoods,	burning	crosses	.	.	.	same	everywhere,	I	expect.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	couldn’t	even	begin	to	fathom	a	Klan	murder,	much	less	a	Klan	murder	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	shop.	But	now	that	I	knew	a	bit,	I	needed	to	know	it	all.	“Would	you	tell	me the	story?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	put	a	hand	over	mine.	“It’s	a	story	that	needs	telling,	though	it’s	hard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 was	 April,	 a	 beautiful	 spring.	 Warm	 but	 not	 humid.	 Perfect	 weather	 for sitting	 out	 with	 a	 picnic.	 I	 remember	 it	 was	 a	 Saturday	 because	 Berkeley	 and Divina	 had	 been	 over	 at	 the	 town	 park	 doing	 just	 that	 while	 I	 minded	 the station.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About	 dusk,	 they	 were	 walking	 back	 to	 the	 station	 when	 a	 whole	 gang	 of Klansmen	 on	 horseback	 came	 into	 town.	 I	 saw	 them	 coming	 from	 the	 station window,	but	I	couldn’t	get	to	Berkeley	in	time.	Normally,	the	Hudsons	were	very careful	about	being	out	in	public,	what	with	miscegenation	laws	and	everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	they	couldn’t	resist	on	this	gorgeous	day,	and	the	wrong	person	had	spotted them	in	the	park,	asked	the	Klan	to	send	a	message.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	felt	the	tears	pushing	against	the	back	of	my	eyes,	but	I	willed	them	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	story	didn’t	need	my	tears,	only	my	ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Berkeley	 pushed	 Divina	 into	 some	 bushes	 next	 to	 the	 garage	 there.”	 He pointed	over	to	the	alleyway	between	the	shop	and	the	hardware	store	next	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then,	he	ran	as	fast	as	he	could	for	the	front	door.	I	was	ready.	Ready	to	lock the	door	behind	him	and	head	out	the	back	door	as	fast	as	we	could	go.	But	they got	him	first	.	.	.”	he	grew	quiet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	my	word.”	My	voice	was	shaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	took	him	around	back	.	.	.	and	I	found	him	after	I	heard	them	ride	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	nothing	I	could	do,	so	I	just	sat	with	him	until	he	passed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	put	my	hand	on	Mr.	Sylvester’s	knee.	“I	don’t	even	know	what	to	say.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>He	 placed	 his	 other	 hand	 over	 my	 own.	 “There	 are	 no	 words.”	 He	 took	 a long,	slow	breath,	and	then,	his	eyes	met	mine	again.	“But	thank	you	for	letting me	share	the	story.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	 course.	 And	 any	 time	 you	 want	 to	 come	 and	 be	 in	 this	 space,	 you	 are welcome.	Any	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stood	up,	and	I	rose	with	him.	“Thank	you	for	telling	me	that	story,	Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sylvester.	 I’m	 horrified,	 but	 also	 honored	 to	 carry	 it	 with	 me.”	 I	 looked	 up	 at him,	and	a	soft	smile	crossed	his	lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	he’d	like	that	a	bookstore	was	here	.	.	.	and	you	even	got	the	smell	of gasoline	and	clove	cigarettes	out,”	he	said	with	a	small	chuckle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lysol	and	candles	make	a	great	combination.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	out	over	the	store	again	and	then	turned	toward	the	door.	“Thank</p>
<p class="calibre1">you,	Ms.	Beckett.	I’ll	be	seeing	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 scanned	 the	 store	 quickly	 as	 he	 left,	 and	 seeing	 it	 was	 empty,	 locked	 the door	behind	him	and	slid	to	the	floor	against	it,	sobbing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 few	 minutes	 later,	 someone	 knocked	 gently	 on	 the	 glass	 above	 my	 head, and	I	turned,	 expecting	to	see	 Daniel.	Instead,	Marcus’s	 concerned	face	 looked back	at	me.	“You	okay?”	he	mouthed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded	and	unlocked	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 saw	 you	 sitting	 there	 and	 thought	 you	 might	 be	 hurt.”	 Marcus’	 jaw	 was tight	with	worry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	thank	you	for	checking	on	me,	Marcus.	I’m	okay.	Just	a	hard	day.	Lots</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	sad	news.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	down	at	his	feet.	“Yeah,	lots	of	sad	things	these	days.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 didn’t	 know	 if	 I	 had	 the	 energy	 to	 have	 yet	 another	 intense	 conversation, but	Marcus	looked	like	he	needed	to	talk.	So	I	slid	down	to	the	floor	again,	and he	sat	down	in	front	of	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Marcus,	you	can	tell	me	to	mind	my	own	business,	but	I’m	kind	of	worried</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	up	sharply.	“You	don’t	need	to	worry	about	me,	Ms.	Beckett.	I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	fine.	You	got	enough	worries	without	adding	me	to	the	list.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	kid.	“Okay,	so	tell	me	about	you.	Where	do	you	come	from?	What	do</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a>you	do	with	your	time,	besides	read	really	great	books,	I	mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiled.	“I’m	from	here	in	St.	Marin’s	actually,	but	my	family	hasn’t	lived</p>
<p class="calibre1">here	in	a	while.	Mom	and	I	moved	away	a	while	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	that’s	right.	You	said	your	mom	was	an	English	teacher.	Did	she	teach</p>
<p class="calibre1">here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	nodded	but	wouldn’t	meet	my	eyes.	“For	a	while.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	leaned	forward	and	caught	his	gaze.	“Marcus?”	I	didn’t	want	to	push,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">sometimes,	a	little	nudge	was	all	someone	needed	to	feel	heard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	reporter	that	got	killed?”	His	voice	was	tight,	and	his	jaw	hard.	Maybe</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	was	the	anger	Lucas	had	noted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly,	 I	 remembered	 the	 newspaper	 article	 about	 the	 teacher	 and	 the Little	Free	Library.	“Oh,	Marcus,	Lucia	Stevensmith	wrote	those	horrible	things about	your	mom.	I’m	so	sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	about	that?”	He	seemed	wary,	ready	to	bolt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	back.	“I	do.	I	was	doing	some	research	into	the	murder,	and	I	read	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">article.	 It	 was	 so	 unkind	 .	 .	 .	 your	 mom	 had	 done	 a	 wonderful	 thing,	 and	 that woman—“	I	couldn’t	finish	the	sentence	because	I	was	too	angry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,”	 Marcus	 said.	 “She	 quit	 teaching	 after	 that.	 We	 moved	 over	 to Annapolis	so	she	could	start	over	as	a	librarian.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 was	 grasping	 at	 hope	 anywhere	 I	 could	 get	 it.	 “Does	 she	 like	 being	 a librarian?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 think	 so.”	 There	 was	 some	 life	 in	 his	 voice	 again.	 “She	 loves	 helping people	 find	 books,	 and	 story	 time	 is	 her	 favorite.	 Plus,	 the	 library	 system	 is paying	for	her	to	get	her	Master’s.	She	loves	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	bet	she	misses	teaching,	too?”	I	couldn’t	imagine	what	it	would	feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	 to	 be	 chased	 away	 from	 a	 job	 you	 loved,	 and	 this	 woman	 had	 obviously loved	 her	 job.	 You	 didn’t	 build	 a	 Little	 Free	 Library	 for	 the	 kids	 you	 taught	 if you	didn’t	have	passion	for	what	you	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	she	does.	But	she’s	okay.	Really.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	are	you	okay?”	I	thought	for	sure	I	saw	tears	well	up	in	his	eyes,	but	he straightened	up	and	looked	away	quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	 yeah,	 I’m	 okay.	 Still	 trying	 to	 get	 my	 feet	 under	 me	 after	 moving</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>back,	 you	 know,	 but	 I’m	 okay.	 I	 appreciate	 the	 work	 you’ve	 given	 me,	 Ms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beckett.	It	helps.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled.	“Well,	I	appreciate	the	work	you’ve	done	here,	Marcus.	In	fact,	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’d	 like	 to	 work	 here	 part-time,	 I	 could	 really	 use	 the	 help.”	 I	 hadn’t	 been planning	on	bringing	on	part-time	help	so	soon,	but	I	needed	it	.	.	.	and	it	looked like	Marcus	needed	it,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	at	me	warily.	“I	don’t	want	no	pity	job,	Ms.	Beckett.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 not	 pity,	 Marcus.	 Have	 you	 seen	 how	 busy	 we’ve	 been	 the	 past	 few days?	Between	those	two	online	posts	that	bring	in	the	book	lovers	and	the	two murders	that	bring	in	the	looky-loos,	we	are	slammed.	I	would	love	the	chance	to get	 away	 from	 the	 register	 more	 and	 talk	 to	 people.	 If	 you	 worked	 for	 me,	 I could	do	that	.	.	.	and	you’d	get	the	hefty	fifty	percent	discount	on	all	the	books in	the	store.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait,	what?!	Working	here	comes	with	a	discount?	Alright	then,	when	can	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">start?”	 He	 was	 grinning	 like	 he	 was	 kidding,	 but	 I	 knew	 –	 any	 book	 lover appreciates	a	good	discount	on	books. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	about	tomorrow?	We	open	at	ten,	so	be	here	at	nine-thirty.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	jumped	up.	“Absolutely.	Thanks,	Ms.	B.	Is	it	alright	if	I	call	you	Ms.	B?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	 love	 that.	 I’ve	 never	 had	 a	 nickname,	 well,	 except	 for	 Harvey,	 of course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	been	meaning	to	ask—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 turned	 him	 toward	 the	 door.	 “Another	 time	 I’ll	 tell	 you	 the	 whole	 story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tonight,	you	go	get	some	food,”	I	handed	him	a	twenty,	“and	get	a	good	night’s sleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyes	darted	down	to	his	feet	for	just	a	second	before	he	looked	back	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,	Ms.	B.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	paused.	“Marcus,	do	you	have	a	place	to	sleep?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 looked	 down	 again,	 and	 I	 thought	 of	 all	 the	 paper	 towels.	 He’d	 been washing	up	in	the	bathroom.	Why	hadn’t	I	figured	that	out	before? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	it.	Give	me	my	money	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyes	got	really	wide,	and	he	held	the	twenty	out	to	me	limply.	“I’m	sorry, Ms.	B.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>“Oh,	 stop	 it.”	 I	 glanced	 out	 the	 window	 and	 saw	 Daniel	 and	 Taco	 waiting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	 all	 going	 to	 get	 dinner,	 and	 then	 you’ll	 stay	 with	 Mart	 and	 me	 tonight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tomorrow,	we’ll	make	a	plan	to	get	you	a	place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	do	that—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 can,	 and	 you	 will.	 Listen,	 you	 don’t	 know	 me	 well	 yet,	 but	 I’m stubborn,	and	I	like	to	be	helpful.	So	let	me	help.	It’ll	make	me	feel	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	grinned	then.	“Thank	you,	Ms.	B.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Truly,	my	pleasure.	Now,	go	tell	Daniel	that	we’re	going	to	dinner	at	Chez</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cuisine.	My	treat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bell	rang,	and	I	jogged	through	the	shop,	turning	off	lights,	checking	the doors,	 and	 arming	 the	 alarm.	 This	 might	 have	 been	 the	 most	 emotionally grueling	 day	 of	 my	 life,	 but	 something	 told	 me,	 I	 probably	 shouldn’t	 say	 such things. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a><b class="calibre3">11</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	time	we	opened	the	next	day,	we’d	arranged	to	have	Marcus</p>
<p class="calibre1">move	into	the	 room	above	Daniel’s	 garage.	It	had,	 apparently,	been	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">studio	apartment	at	one	time,	so	it	just	needed	some	appliances,	a	little</p>
<p class="calibre1">repair	to	the	floors	and	walls,	and	a	good	cleaning	to	be	a	perfect	apartment	for	a twenty-year-old	man.	It	took	some	convincing	to	get	Marcus	to	agree	to	take	the apartment	rent	free	for	the	first	month,	but	when	Daniel	pointed	out	that	his	rent would	be	sweat	equity	in	fixing	the	place	up,	Marcus	finally	said	yes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	even	started	talking	about	getting	a	cat	since	he’d	been	so	enthralled	with Aslan	at	our	place	the	night	before.	She	had	also	been	quite	taken	with	him	and had	given	up	her	spot	at	my	feet	to	set	up	shop	on	the	guest	room	bed	with	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	morning,	when	I	peeked	in,	she	had	wiggled	her	way	up	to	the	pillow	and was	draped	across	Marcus’s	forehead.	If	his	snore	was	any	indication,	he	didn’t mind	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	we	didn’t	have	time	this	weekend	to	move	Marcus	in	.	.	.	the	aftereffects</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 Michiko	 Kakutani’s	 tweet	 combined	 with	 the	 response	 to	 Galen	 Gilbert’s Insta	post	were	still	sending	book	buyers	from	all	over	Maryland,	Virginia,	and Delaware.	And	the	murder	tourists	–	who	knew	there	was	such	a	thing?	–	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	coming,	too.	Plus,	now,	we	added	the	people	who	had	come	to	town	for	the street	fair	.	.	.	and	we	were	slammed.	Lines	at	the	register,	five	pots	of	coffee	by eleven	a.m.	Rocky	had	to	ask	her	mother	Phoebe	to	come	help,	we	were	so	busy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	amazing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>Marcus	took	to	the	register	like	a	champ	and	was	chatting	with	customers	all the	while	he	scanned	books.	If	I	hadn’t	known	better,	I’d	think	he’d	been	doing this	 for	 years.	 Mart	 was	 on	 hand	 to	 help	 with	 bagging	 and	 to	 take	 over	 if	 he needed	to	walk	a	customer	to	a	particular	book	recommendation.	I’m	pretty	sure he	hand-sold	more	than	a	few	dozen	books	that	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	my	handy	people	counter	out	again,	and	by	noon,	we’d	had	743	people</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	store.	Every	seat	was	taken	at	almost	every	minute,	and	Rocky	and	Phoebe were	doing	a	brisk	business	of	customers	both	in	the	café	and	with	take-out	cups. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	very	glad	Phoebe	had	come	in	and	also	that	I’d	asked	Woody	if	he	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	on	call	to	help	out	as	needed.	Turns	out	our	need	involved	more	paper	cups, so	 he	 contacted	 the	 Baptist	 church	 down	 the	 street	 and	 asked	 if	 we	 could	 buy theirs.	 The	 pastor	 donated	 them,	 said	 she	 was	 happy	 to	 help	 support	 the	 local bookstore	 and	 would	 replace	 the	 church’s	 supply	 with	 her	 own	 money.	 I	 loved this	town	more	and	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	had	a	full	slate	of	customers	of	his	own	that	day,	but	he	did	drop	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	after	lunch	to	marvel.	“Whew!	Look	at	this	place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 took	 the	 minute	 to	 sit	 down	 in	 the	 chair	 I’d	 tucked	 in	 the	 storeroom	 first thing	that	morning	just	so	that	all	of	us	could	get	a	break	for	a	few	minutes	at	a time.	I	still	didn’t	love	this	room,	but	it	was	the	only	private	space	in	the	shop, and	 with	 this	 many	 customers,	 we	 needed	 a	 little	 private	 space.	 “I	 know!	 It’s amazing,	but	holy	cow	do	my	feet	hurt.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 was	 wearing	 my	 trusty	 Danskos,	 which	 my	 forty-four-year-old	 feet</p>
<p class="calibre1">appreciated,	but	even	their	mighty	arches	weren’t	enough	to	keep	the	ache	away altogether.	 I’d	 been	 walking	 customers	 to	 and	 fro	 all	 morning	 and	 bringing	 out new	titles	or	replacement	copies	in	every	spare	minute.	I	was	glad	I’d	ordered	a lot	of	books	for	the	week	and	super	grateful	to	have	the	cash	to	do	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	sat	down	on	a	stack	of	boxes	next	to	me.	“I	think	we	can	safely	say</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	your	store	is	officially	viable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	think?”	I	laughed,	but	inside,	I	was	profoundly	grateful.	The	kindness</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 strangers	 .	 .	 .	 it	 was	 an	 expression	 I’d	 heard	 a	 lot,	 but	 now	 I	 was	 on	 the receiving	end	of	it.	I	felt	humbled	and	even	more	determined	than	ever	to	make this	shop	do	its	good	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>I	 could	 hear	 the	 sound	 of	 conversation	 through	 the	 door.	 “Thanks	 for stopping	by.”	I	gestured	toward	the	door.	“I	probably	need	to	get	out	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	right.	Definitely.	But	before	you	go,	I	almost	forgot	the	second	reason	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">stopped	by.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	to	look	at	him.	“Okay,	but	first,	what’s	the	first	reason?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 put	 his	 hand	 on	 my	 cheek.	 “I	 think	 you	 know	 that	 one.	 But	 the	 second one.	Max	Davis	came	by.	He	wanted	my	opinion	on	a	sound	he	was	hearing	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	car,	at	least	that’s	what	he	said,	but	I	think	he	was	fishing	for	information.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Information	about	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	that’s	the	thing.	He	kept	talking	around	something,	at	least	I	think	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Said	something	about	us	being	in	the	restaurant	last	night,	that	maybe	I	needed to	think	more	about	myself	and	less	about	helping	‘our	new	neighbor.’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	 meal	 the	 night	 before	 had	 been	 perfect	 –	 crab	 cakes	 with	 remoulade sauce	 for	 the	 guys.	 A	 really	 amazing	 quiche	 for	 me.	 I	 think	 Max	 had	 been mortified	at	my	poor	taste	when	I	ordered	the	quiche	for	dinner.	He	even	came</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	 to	 suggest	 the	 chicken	 fricassee	 instead,	 but	 I	 held	 firm	 –	 I	 wanted	 cheese and	eggs	–	and	he’d	relented.	It	was	so	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Clearly,	he	knows	I’m	a	bad	influence,”	I	said,	trying	to	make	light	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">insult. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	laughed,	but	the	chuckle	didn’t	reach	his	eyes.	“He	was	being	casual, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harvey,	but	I	don’t	think	he	was	kidding.	I	think	he	was	really	trying	to	warn	me off	of	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 felt	 tears	 clawing	 their	 way	 up	 my	 throat,	 but	 I	 couldn’t	 let	 Daniel	 know how	much	that	bothered	me	.	.	.	or	how	much	I	was	afraid	Daniel	would	listen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it	working?”	My	laugh	came	out	crackly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	 for	 a	 second.”	 He	 leaned	 down	 and	 gave	 me	 a	 gentle	 kiss.	 Then	 he pulled	back	and	looked	me	in	the	eyes.	“He	got	me	worried,	though.	I	know	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	Stevensmith	had	a	falling	out	.	.	.	do	you	think	he	could	be	the	murderer?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	thought	had	crossed	my	mind.	Between	the	very	palpable	resentment	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	about	the	reporter’s	reviews	and	the	potential	that	he	might	have	been	faking his	paranoia	about	being	a	victim	at	the	street	fair,	I	thought	it	quite	possible	that he	might	be	our	guy.	But	I	still	had	a	question.	“Why	would	he	warn	you	off	me, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a><img src="index-139_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">though?	What’s	the	value	in	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	 gave	 me	 a	 very	 serious	 look	 and	 then	 widened	 his	 eyes	 as	 if	 he couldn’t	believe	I	wasn’t	getting	it,	but	I	wasn’t	getting	it.	“Harvey,	he’s	trying	to get	me	out	of	the	way	so	he	can	get	to	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	“Nah,	that’s	ridiculous.  <i class="calibre4">Max</i>	is	also	ridiculous,	but	he’s	not dangerous	.	.	.	and	he’s	definitely	not	this	conniving.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 sure	 about	 that?”	 Daniel	 wasn’t	 convinced,	 and	 as	 confident	 as	 I	 was trying	 to	 sound,	 I	 wasn’t	 completely	 convinced	 either.	 “At	 least,	 make	 sure you’re	not	alone	okay?	Keep	Mart	or	Rocky	or	me	nearby.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 wanted	 to	 protest,	 claim	 my	 introversion	 as	 something	 that	 required	 time alone,	but	I	knew	it	was	better	safe	than	sorry.	Plus,	I	didn’t	want	to	worry	my friends,	 at	 least	 not	 any	 more	 than	 they	 were	 already.	 I	 promised	 Daniel	 I wouldn’t	be	alone	anywhere	but	the	bathroom,	and	he	thanked	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	then	it	was	time	for	me	to	get	back	to	work.	He	gave	me	a	quick	hug	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">followed	 me	 out	 the	 door	 and	 back	 into	 the	 shop.	 I	 was	 glad	 to	 see	 the	 crowd hadn’t	 thinned	 because	 I	 really	 needed	 something	 to	 distract	 me	 from	 the	 fact that	someone	I	knew	might	be	out	to	kill	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	BOOK	BUYERS	kept	on	coming,	and	I	lost	myself	in	recommending	books	–</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rick	Riordan’s	Egyptian	series	for	a	pre-teen	boy	who	liked	reading,	but	only	if it	 was	 adventure,	 then	 Sarah	 Vowell’s	  <i class="calibre4">Wordy	 Shipmates</i>	 for	 a	 history	 buff	 who appreciated	a	wry	and	witty	critique,	and	finally	Toni	Morrison’s	 <i class="calibre4">Paradise</i>	to	the woman	who	loved	Morrison	but	only	knew	her	most	popular	books.  <i class="calibre4">“Paradise</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 my	 favorite.	 I	 especially	 love	 that	 it’s	 about	 a	 group	 of	 powerful	 women,”	 I said.	She	bought	a	copy	for	herself	and	one	for	her	best	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Between	customers,	I	tried	to	keep	the	shelves	full	–	or	at	least	looking	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	magazine	rack	looked	like	a	turkey	skeleton	after	Thanksgiving,	and	the	true crime	 shelves	 were	 almost	 bare.	 I	 wasn’t	 sure	 what	 I	 was	 going	 to	 do	 about inventory	 for	 tomorrow’s	 street	 fair,	 but	 when	 the	 sun	 started	 to	 set,	 the	 crowd thinned	out.	I	thought	I’d	get	a	minute	to	think,	but	Cate	and	Lucas	came	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>I	must	have	looked	about	like	I	felt	because	Cate	gave	me	a	once	over,	turned to	Lucas,	and	said,	“Yep.	This	calls	for	soup	in	a	bread	bowl.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	 the	 idea	 of	 hot	 soup	 and	 yeasty	 bread	 made	 me	 salivate.	 I	 had	 never gotten	around	to	lunch,	and	my	body	needed	nourishment.	Nourishment	and	rest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	sounds	amazing,	but	I	have	to	figure	out	what	I’m	going	to	do	about	books for	tomorrow.	We	don’t	have	enough	stock	to	do	a	bargain	table	on	the	sidewalk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	have	the	‘mystery’	books	for	folks	to	buy,	but	the	rest	of	my	inventory	really needs	to	stay	in	here.	Otherwise,	I’m	afraid	people	will	think	we’re	going	out	of business.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cate	 pointed	 to	 the	 chair	 in	 the	 fiction	 section	 and	 gestured	 for	 me	 to	 sit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	she	started	rubbing	her	index	finger	against	her	thumb	while	she	turned	in circles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	okay?”	I	asked	Lucas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiled.	“Oh	yes.	This	is	her	thinking	ritual.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cate	 turned	 a	 few	 more	 times,	 and	 then	 she	 stopped	 and	 looked	 at	 me.	 “I have	an	idea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See?	Told	you.”	Lucas	said	as	he	looked	from	his	wife	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	laughed.	“You	two	are	cute.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	both	rolled	their	eyes,	thus	confirming	my	comment.	“Okay,	what’s	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">idea?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Used	books.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Before	you	object.	Yes,	you	are	a	new	book	bookstore,	but	for	this	purpose, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wouldn’t	it	be	fun	to	just	have	a	bunch	of	miscellaneous	books,	all	for	one	dollar, let’s	 say.	 People	 could	 pick	 up	 titles	 for	 themselves,	 for	 their	 friends,	 for	 the Little	Free	Library	boxes	that	are	so	wonderfully	cropping	up	everywhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 considered	 the	 idea	 for	 a	 moment.	 “Okay,	 I	 can	 get	 on	 board	 with	 that.	 It does	sound	fun,	but	where	do	we	get	all	these	books?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lucas	 laughed	 so	 loudly	 that	 several	 people	 in	 the	 shop	 turned	 to	 look	 at him.	“Are	you	ready?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ready?	Ready	for	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cate	 blushed.	 “Well,	 I	 have	 a	 basement	 full	 of	 books.	 Hundreds,	 maybe</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a>thousands	of	books.	I’d	love	to	donate	them,	maybe	have	the	proceeds	go	to	the scholarship	fund?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	up	very	straight	in	my	chair.	“Whoa,	whoa,	whoa.	I	have	about	a	million</p>
<p class="calibre1">questions.	First,	you	have	thousands	of	books	in	your	basement?	How	does	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">happen?	I	mean	I	love	books,	obviously,	but	thousands?	Are	they	boxed	up?	On</p>
<p class="calibre1">shelves?”	I	turned	my	head	to	look	at	my	friend	out	of	the	corner	of	my	eye.	“Or is	this	one	of	those	hoarding	scenarios	where	I’d	have	to	turn	sideways	and	not touch	anything	lest	I	be	buried	alive	next	to	Sasquatch’s	predecessor?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	 this	 about	 being	 buried	 alive?”	 Mart’s	 voice	 was	 a	 little	 high-pitched.	I	guess	even	joking	about	death	was	a	little	too	close	to	home	right	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lucas	 said,	 “Harvey	 is	 just	 marveling	 at	 the	 fact	 that	 my	 wife	 has	 been accumulating	books	for	decades.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cate	 smiled.	 “<i class="calibre4">Accumulating</i>	 is	 the	 nice	 way	 of	 putting	 it.	 I	 adore	 books, especially	art	books,	and	I’ve	never	been	able	to	part	with	a	book	once	I	brought it	home.	So	the	basement	is	lined	with	bookshelves,	all	sorted	by	subject.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 you	 want	 to	 part	 with	 them	 now?”	 I	 had	 a	 pretty	 sizable	 book collection	 myself	 –	 not	 that	 sizable	 but	 still	 –	 and	 I	 was	 very	 selective	 about what	books	I	gave	away.	I	loved	Cate’s	idea,	but	I	wanted	to	be	sure	she	actually loved	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	do.	Actually,	I’ve	been	talking	about	it	for	a	long	time.	I	want	to	set	up	a studio	in	the	basement,	but	I	need	more	natural	light.	To	get	more	natural	light,	I need	more	windows.	To	get	more	windows,	I	have	to	have	walls	.	.	.	and	right</p>
<p class="calibre1">now,	every	wall	is	covered	with	a	bookshelf.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lucas	looked	at	me	and	said,	“It’s	time.	Please,	please	accept	this	offer.	I’m tired	 of	 having	 to	 eat	 dinner	 on	 a	 TV	 tray	 because	 a	 painting	 is	 drying	 on	 the dining	room	table.”	He	got	down	on	his	knees	and	clasped	his	hands	together	in front	of	me.	“Take	the	books,	Harvey.	Please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 cracked	 up.	 These	 two	 people	 made	 me	 very	 happy.	 I	 looked	 at	 Cate.	 “If you’re	sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Totally.”	She	headed	toward	the	door,	and	then	looked	back	at	Lucas.	“You</p>
<p class="calibre1">coming?	We	have	books	to	sort.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	guess	we’re	leaving,	but	come	by	after	you	close	up.	I’ll	have	potato	soup</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>–	with	bacon,	I	presume?	–	in	a	sour	dough	bread	bowl	for	you.	You,	too,	Mart.	” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	loved	a	lot	of	things	about	San	Francisco,	but	soup	in	a	bread	bowl	–</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	was	one	of	my	favorites.	“Yes	to	the	bacon,	please,”	I	looked	at	Mart	who was	 nodding	 her	 head	 like	 she	 was	 one	 of	 those	 bobblehead	 dolls	 in	 the	 back window	 of	 a	 car	 on	 a	 back	 road.	 “We’ll	 see	 you	 later,”	 I	 called	 after	 Cate	 and Lucas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	word,”	Mart	said.	“So	we	need	to	get	some	tables?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	 crap.	 I	 hadn’t	 even	 thought	 about	 tables.”	 Here	 I	 was	 recommending that	people	put	out	tables	with	specials	for	the	fair,	and	I	didn’t	even	have	a	table myself,	 much	 less	 enough	 tables	 to	 hold	 hundreds,	 maybe	 thousands	 of	 Cate’s books. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	already	had	her	phone	out.	“No	worries.	I	got	this.”	As	I	got	up	to	tidy</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	the	store	and	help	Marcus	ring	up	the	last	few	customers,	Mart	slid	into	the chair	without	even	looking	up	from	her	phone.	She	had	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	time	we	closed	up,	we’d	had	1,854	visitors	to	the	store	–	maybe	a	few</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	 since	 I	 was	 in	 the	 back	 for	 a	 bit	 with	 Daniel.	 And	 a	 quick	 run	 of	 the register	 tally	 showed	 I’d	 made	 more	 that	 day	 than	 I	 had	 in	 all	 the	 days	 before combined.	I	was	giddy.	Giddy	and	exhausted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	I	wanted	was	that	soup	in	a	bread	bowl,	a	big	cup	of	tea,	and	my	bed.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	 still	 had	 prep	 to	 do	 for	 the	 next	 day.	 At	 least	 I	 thought	 we	 had	 prep	 to	 do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	 we’re	 all	 set.	 Tables,	 extra	 coffee	 carafes,	 more	 cups	 and	 plates,	 and	 a supply	 of	 St.	 Boudreau’s	 best	 wine	 will	 be	 here	 at	 nine	 a.m.	 Anything	 else	 we need?	My	boss	is	happy	to	help.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 just	 stared	 at	 her	 for	 a	 minute	 while	 my	 brain	 tried	 to	 process	 what	 she’d just	said.	“We’re	having	wine?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep,	I’ll	be	serving	as	an	employee	of	the	winery	–	just	tastings	–	but	we’ll have	bottles	for	sale,	too.	Thought	it	might	get	a	little	more	foot	traffic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	felt	the	smile	on	my	face,	and	I	was	very	excited	.	.	.	but	the	idea	that	even more	people	would	be	coming	to	my	store	left	me	a	little	stupefied.	The	shock</p>
<p class="calibre1">slowly	gave	way	to	panic.	“Mart,	where	are	we	going	to	put	all	these	things?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got	that	under	control,	Ms.	B,”	Marcus	said	as	he	dropped	beside	me	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">floor.	“I	did	a	sketch.”	He	handed	me	a	sheet	of	printer	paper	with	what	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>like	a	to-scale	drawing	of	the	store. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 wine	 would	 be	 in	 the	 front	 of	 the	 café	 against	 the	 windows	 to	 draw people	 in	 but	 not	 impede	 the	 flow	 for	 pastry	 eaters	 and	 coffee	 drinkers.	 Then, we’d	shift	the	café	tables	into	the	main	part	of	the	shop,	giving	people	places	to sit	and	rest	with	their	wine	or	coffee	but	also	keeping	the	space	open	in	the	café itself.	 Then,	 Cate’s	 books	 would	 be	 on	 long	 tables	 all	 across	 the	 front	 and	 the side	 of	 the	 store	 that	 opened	 onto	 a	 parking	 lot.	 Mart	 had	 secured	 permission from	 the	 garden	 center	 next	 door	 to	 use	 the	 edge	 of	 their	 lot	 since	 it	 was	 a	 bit early	for	them	to	have	much	merchandise,	but	they	had	also	assured	her	that	they would	do	their	part	and	have	as	many	flowering	shrubs	as	they	could	out	on	the street	to	draw	people	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 studied	 the	 plan	 and	 let	 out	 a	 hard	 sigh.	 It	 was	 all	 under	 control.	 “Thank you	all	so	much.	I	feel	like	I	say	this	all	the	time,	but	really,	I	couldn’t	do	this without	you.”	I	blew	Rocky	a	kiss	as	she	and	her	mom	cleaned	up	the	last	of	the dishes	and	shut	down	the	café. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 gave	 everyone	 hugs	 as	 they	 headed	 out	 the	 door.	 Mart	 lingered	 just	 long enough	 for	 Daniel	 to	 arrive,	 and	 then	 she	 gave	 Marcus	 a	 lift	 home.	 He’d	 be staying	with	us	until	he	had	time	to	get	his	apartment	ready.	“Meet	you	at	Cate and	Lucas’s?”	she	said.	“You	come,	too,	Daniel.	Cate	said	so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sounds	good.”	He	waved	as	they	left,	and	then	looked	at	me.	“What	am	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">doing	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Potato	soup	in	a	bread	bowl,”	I	said	with	a	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	man,	that	sounds	so	good.”	He	pointed	to	the	window	display.	“You	sit</p>
<p class="calibre1">here.	I’ll	close	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 smiled	 and	 gave	 him	 the	 alarm	 code.	 It	 felt	 good	 to	 sit	 down.	 As	 Daniel headed	toward	me	across	the	shop,	I	heard	a	knock	at	the	window	and	turned	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	 Elle	 there	 –	 her	 arms	 full	 of	 flowers.	 I	 groaned.	 I	 had	 totally	 forgotten	 she was	bringing	those	by	for	tomorrow.	I	shouted	to	Daniel	and	asked	him	to	turn</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	the	alarm,	and	then	I	let	Elle	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 flowers	 were	 amazing.	 I	 had	 imagined	 she’d	 bring	 me	 pink	 and	 purple flowers	 –	 soft	 pastels	 –	 but	 there	 were	 salmon	 blooms	 and	 hot	 pink	 ones,	 too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	 a	 burgundy	 and	 a	 yellow.	 “Oh,	 Elle,	 I	 love	 them.	 I	 didn’t	 realize	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>hyacinths	came	in	so	many	hues.	Thank	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 welcome.	 I’m	 sorry	 I	 didn’t	 get	 here	 sooner.	 I	 got	 caught	 up	 with customers	all	day.	Most	of	them	had	books,	so	I	think	we	probably	have	you	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">thank	for	the	boost	in	early-season	business.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	wasn’t	me.	It	was	Michiko	Kakutani	and	Galen	Gilbert	and	their	fans.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">can’t	believe	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	set	the	five-gallon	buckets	full	of	flowers	and	water	down	to	the	left	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	door.	“You’re	being	too	humble.	They	praised	your	shop	because	it’s	worth</p>
<p class="calibre1">praising.	This	is	a	wonderful	spot,	Harvey.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 thank	 you,	 and	 I	 am	 really	 glad	 my	 good	 fortune	 is	 spreading	 down the	street.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	it	most	definitely	is.	I	sold	out	of	butternut	squash	by	eleven	a.m..	I’ve never	 been	 so	 glad	 for	 my	 little	 greenhouse	 and	 the	 fact	 that	 peas	 love	 cooler weather.	 I’m	 glad	 I	 ordered	 extra	 flowers,	 too.	 Lots	 of	 folks	 have	 spring	 fever and	wanted	fresh	bouquets.	But	I	held	these	back	.	.	.	just	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 looked	 again	 at	 the	 flowers.	 “These	 are	 amazing.	 They’re	 a	 much-needed boost	after	a	whopper	of	a	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indeed.	After	the	news	about	the	sheriff,	we	all	need	a	boost.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	clenched	my	jaw.	“The	sheriff?	What	happened?”	I	looked	to	Daniel	as	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">walked	up	and	then	back	at	Elle.	“Is	he	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,”	Elle	put	her	hand	on	my	arm,	“I’m	sorry,	honey.	I	didn’t	mean	to	scare</p>
<p class="calibre1">you.	Oh	yes,	Sheriff	Mason	is	fine.	But	someone	did	slash	his	tires	and	paint	that horrible	word	on	his	patrol	car.	He	was	madder	than	spit	when	I	saw	him	a	few</p>
<p class="calibre1">hours	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	to	Daniel.	“Oh	my	goodness.	Had	you	heard	about	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep.	Pretty	awful.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 shook	 my	 head.	 “As	 if	 he	 doesn’t	 have	 enough	 to	 deal	 with,	 two	 people murdered	 including	 his	 deputy,	 and	 someone	 wants	 to	 stir	 up	 racist	 BS. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unbelievable.”	 I	 could	 feel	 the	 anger	 running	 through	 my	 fingers.	 When	 I’m tired,	my	emotions	often	get	the	best	of	me,	and	tonight	I	was	exhausted.	“Does he	know	who	did	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elle	 shrugged.	 “He’s	 pretty	 tight-lipped	 about	 most	 things.”	 She	 looked</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a><img src="index-145_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">down	and	sighed.	Then	she	met	my	gaze	again.	“But	he’s	a	force	to	be	reckoned</p>
<p class="calibre1">with.	I	wouldn’t	mess	with	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	He	seemed	mild-mannered,	but	I	imagined	that	if	he	needed	to	be, </p>
<p class="calibre1">our	kind	sheriff	could	be	a	hurricane	of	justice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	headed	back	to	re-arm	the	alarm,	and	Elle	and	I	walked	out	onto	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">street.	 “Thanks	 again	 for	 the	 flowers,	 Elle.	 I’ll	 get	 you	 a	 check	 once	 all	 this slows	down,	if	that’s	alright.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 that’s	 fine.	 We’ll	 all	 be	 a	 little	 flush	 with	 cash	 after	 this	 weekend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thanks	again	for	this,	Harvey.	You’ve	really	boosted	not	only	our	revenues,	but our	spirits	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	blushed.	“That’s	kind	of	you	to	say.	Now,	if	only	we	could	find	the	person</p>
<p class="calibre1">who	murdered	Stevensmith	and	Deputy	Williams.	It	would	feel	like	a	good	end</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	a	hard	couple	of	weeks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elle	 shrugged.	 “I	 guess	 so.	 Sometimes,	 though,	 I	 think	 some	 questions	 are best	left	unanswered,	don’t	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	 came	 out	 and	 joined	 us.	 “Some	 questions,	 yes,”	 he	 said,	 “but	 not	 a question	about	murder.	All	of	the	questions	about	a	murder	need	to	be	solved.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	gave	us	a	thin	smile	and	climbed	into	her	pick-up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 she	 drove	 away,	 I	 thought	 about	 that	 stack	 of	 newspaper	 articles	 on	 her desk.	What	had	she	been	trying	to	answer? </p>
<p class="calibre1">WE	 MADE	 it	 to	 Cate	 and	 Lucas’s	 just	 as	 the	 soup	 was	 coming	 off	 the	 stove.	 It smelled	heavenly,	like	comfort	had	been	made	into	vapor	and	spread	throughout</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	room.	“Oh,	Lucas,	I	may	pass	out	from	delight,”	I	said	as	I	slung	my	scarf and	coat	over	the	nearest	chair	and	fell	into	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	that’s	a	response	to	my	cooking	that	I	could	get	used	to,”	he	said	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 small	 laugh.	 “I	 left	 the	 bacon	 out	 because	 I	 wasn’t	 sure	 if	 any	 of	 you	 were vegetarian.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bring	 on	 the	 bacon,”	 Mart	 and	 Daniel	 said	 at	 the	 same	 time	 before	 both cracking	up.	We	were	all	a	little	on	edge	with	all	the	busyness	in	the	shop	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a>the	 fair	 tomorrow	 and,	 well,	 the	 murders.	 It	 felt	 good	 to	 just	 be	 silly	 and indulgent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Help	 yourselves,”	 Lucas	 said	 as	 he	 gestured	 to	 a	 spread	 on	 their	 kitchen island.	Normally,	I	was	the	kind	of	person	who	prefers	to	go	last,	but	tonight,	I just	wanted	to	eat.	I	grabbed	a	plate,	a	perfect	bread	bowl	–	not	as	huge	as	those at	Fisherman’s	Wharf	in	San	Francisco	but	not	a	dinner	roll	either	–	and	ladled	it full	with	the	thick,	white	soup.	Then,	I	dropped	a	good	portion	of	bacon	in	and covered	it	all	with	more	than	my	fair	share	of	shredded	cheddar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cate	had	just	finished	pouring	big	glasses	of	ice	cold	water,	so	I	grabbed	one of	those	and	then	tucked	myself	into	the	far	corner	of	the	dining	room	table	by the	window.	I	didn’t	even	mind	my	manners	and	wait	for	everyone	to	sit.	I	just dove	in.	My	mother	would	be	horrified. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 table	 was	 filled	 with	 the	 sounds	 of	 satisfied	 eating	 for	 several	 minutes until	Mart	pushed	back	her	plate,	leaned	back	in	her	chair,	and	said.	“Man	alive, did	I	need	that	or	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	couldn’t	even	find	words.	I	just	nodded.	I	was	satiated	and	relaxed	.	.	.	and wiped	out.	Totally	wiped	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	did	I	forget	to	mention	that	there’s	cupcakes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	 groaned.	 “If	 I	 had	 known,	 I	 wouldn’t	 have	 had	 that	 third	 bowl	 of soup.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know.	That’s	why	I	didn’t	tell	you.”	Lucas	grinned.	“Besides	cupcakes	are, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	my	grandmother	always	said,	highly	squishable.	Want	me	to	poke	around	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	belly	like	she	did	just	to	prove	you	have	room?”	He	pointed	a	finger	toward Daniel’s	stomach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 thank	 you.	 I	 fear	 that	 I	 may	 have	 more	 room	 than	 intended	 if	 you explored.”	He	let	out	a	long	sigh.	“But	I	will	take	a	cupcake	.	.	.	to	honor	your grandmother,	of	course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	 course.”	 Lucas	 got	 up	 and	 came	 back	 with	 a	 tray	 of	 the	 most	 amazing cupcakes	I’d	ever	seen.	They	were	huge	–	the	size	of	those	giant	muffins	you	get in	 some	 bakeries	 –	 and	 topped	 with	 no	 less	 than	 three	 inches	 of	 icing.	 I immediately	 spied	 a	 white	 cake	 with	 white	 icing	 that	 had	 my	 name	 on	 it	 and lunged. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a>Cate	 made	 her	 move	 for	 her	 cupcake	 of	 choice	 at	 the	 same	 time,	 and	 we smacked	heads	hard	just	under	the	chandelier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	back,	cupcake	in	hand,	and	tried	to	focus	while	tears	sprang	to	my	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	appeared,	however,	that	Cate	had	gotten	the	worse	end	of	our	collision	because her	 nose	 was	 bleeding	 .	 .	 .	 and	 worse	 yet,	 it	 was	 dripping	 into	 her	 cupcake frosting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	and	Lucas	sprang	into	action	grabbing	paper	towels	and	removing	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">blemished	cupcake	before	getting	Cate	to	put	her	head	over	the	back	of	the	chair and	applying	pressure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	Cate,	I’m	so,	so	sorry.”	I	felt	terrible.	“Are	you	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	let	out	a	muffled	laugh.	“Oh	yes,	I’m	just	fine.	We	probably	need	to	call</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	shots	on	cupcakes	from	now	on,	though.	Dessert	should	not	be	a	full-contact sport.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 still	 felt	 awful,	 but	 she	 recovered	 quickly,	 claimed	 another	 cupcake,	 and persuaded	 me	 to	 compete	 in	 an	 icing-licking	 competition	 with	 her.	 We	 could only	lick	with	a	flat	tongue.	No	bites	and	no	deep	dives	that	weren’t	really	licks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	person	who	won	had	to	clear	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	fierce	battle,	but	I	was	a	baked	good	expert	and	I	finally	took	her	by a	 few	 licks.	 I	 felt	 a	 little	 light-headed	 from	 the	 blow	 to	 the	 head,	 my	 reduced oxygen	intake	during	the	competition,	and	the	sugar	rush,	but	I	was	still	having	a hard	time	remembering	when	I’d	had	so	much	fun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	end,	we	all	helped	Cate	clean	up	and	then	she	showed	me	her	138	totes</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 books	 that	 she	 was	 bringing	 to	 sell	 in	 the	 morning.	 “Cate,	 woman,	 how	 are you	going	to	get	all	these	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 Woody’s	 coming	 by	 bright	 and	 early	 to	 help	 us	 load.	 We’ll	 be	 at	 the shop	by	eight-thirty	or	nine	to	set	up	.	.	.	unless	you	need	us	earlier.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	ma’am.	After	all	this	work	and	the	fact	that	I	made	you	bleed	tonight</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	 taking	 your	 title	 as	 Icing	 Licker	 Extraordinaire,	 I	 wouldn’t	 dare	 ask	 for more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cate	 slid	 an	 arm	 around	 my	 waist.	 “Harvey,	 you’re	 our	 people.	 Sure	 glad you’re	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled	all	the	way	to	the	door,	where	we	all	hugged	goodbye.	I	had	found</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a><img src="index-148_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">my	people,	and	it	felt	incredible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">MART,	 Daniel,	 the	 two	 dogs,	 and	 I	 took	 the	 long	 way	 home	 via	 Main	 Street.	 I think	we	all	needed	a	little	time	to	wind	down.	The	town	was	quiet.	Televisions lit	 front	 windows	 with	 a	 blue	 glow,	 and,	 as	 we	 passed	 a	 couple	 of	 houses,	 the sounds	of	laughter	reached	us	on	the	sidewalk.	A	few	cars	passed	us	slowly,	no one	in	an	apparent	hurry	to	get	anywhere,	and	while	the	night	was	cool,	it	wasn’t cold.	In	fact,	the	slight	chill	felt	good	against	my	tired	skin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 didn’t	 talk	 much	 except	 to	 make	 sure	 we	 all	 knew	 our	 stations	 for	 the morning.	We	had	just	turned	onto	Main	Street	when	I	saw	a	moving	light	behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	art	co-op.	At	first,	I	thought	it	was	just	someone’s	headlights	as	they	drove through	the	alley	like	a	lot	of	folks	did	to	avoid	the	single	stoplight	in	town.	But then,	when	it	slid	by	my	line	of	vision	again,	I	saw	it	was	a	flashlight	beam	and shook	my	friends’	arms	up	and	down	before	pointing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,”	I	whisper-shouted,	and	we	all	stopped.	Yep,	someone	was	shining	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">light	around	behind	the	co-op	like	they	were	looking	for	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	of	all	those	TV	shows	where	people	are	trying	to	find	something	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	dark	house	and	shine	their	flashlights	all	around	as	if	someone	wouldn’t	notice beams	of	light	in	an	otherwise	dark	house.	This	person	had	clearly	not	watched enough	television. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	pointed	to	us	and	then	down	the	street	and	then	at	himself	and	toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	co-op.	“You	want	us	to	walk	away	and	leave	you	here,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	scowled	.	.	.	and	then	nodded	with	exaggerated	fervor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	three	blocks	away.	I	don’t	think	they	can	hear	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alright.”	 He	 looked	 like	 I’d	 taken	 away	 all	 the	 excitement.	 Maybe	 he’d wanted	to	pretend	we	were	special	forces	or	something.	“Yes,	you	guys	go	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	street	and	call	Sheriff	Mason.	I’ll	get	a	closer	look.	But	here,	take	Taco.	He can’t	sneak	up	on	dinner.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wanted	to	argue,	to	remind	him	that	the	moment	when	people	split	up	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 moment	 when	 the	 killer	 got	 them,	 but	 he	 was	 already	 headed	 toward	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>alley.	At	this	point,	my	safest	course	of	action	was	to	call	the	police,	and	I	didn’t want	to	be	overheard	.	.	.	even	if	I	did	think	that	was	unlikely	still. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	and	I	tried	to	look	casual	as	we	walked	as	fast	as	we	could	past	the	co-</p>
<p class="calibre1">op	 and	 down	 to	 my	 shop.	 Then,	 I	 dialed	 911,	 told	 them	 what	 we’d	 seen,	 that Daniel	was	checking	it	out,	and	that	we	needed	someone	as	soon	as	possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	we	stood	there,	huddled	together	with	the	dogs	straining	to	go	sniffing</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	the	road.	The	cold	air	didn’t	feel	so	great	anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	 as	 Sheriff	 Mason	 pulled	 up	 in	 what	 appeared	 to	 be	 his	 own	 vehicle, wearing	jeans	and	a	T-shirt	and	looking	a	little	bleary-eyed,	Daniel	came	around the	corner	of	the	co-op	building	with	Divina	Stevensmith. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	guys	are	always	in	the	thick	of	it,	huh?”	the	sheriff	said	as	Daniel	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Divina	came	down	the	street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	appears	that	way.	But	I	give	you	my	word	that	this	time,	we	really	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	walking	home	and	saw	a	light,”	I	said,	feeling	chagrined	no	matter	the	truth of	my	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 sheriff	 gave	 me	 a	 skeptical	 look	 but	 turned	 his	 attention	 to	 Daniel	 and Divina	as	they	reached	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	so	sorry	to	worry	everyone.	I	just	lost	one	of	my	good	knives	out	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	of	the	co-op	sometime	recently,	and	I	didn’t	want	to	risk	it	cutting	someone at	the	fair	tomorrow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	kind	of	knife	was	it,	Divina?	Maybe	we	can	help	you	look.”	I	tried	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">keep	my	voice	calm,	but	I	saw	the	sheriff	cut	his	eyes	toward	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 you	 know,	 it’s	 one	 of	 those	 pencil-like	 ones	 that	 has	 a	 razor	 blade	 on the	end	.	.	.	I	think	scrap	bookers	use	them	a	lot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ah,	so	not	the	knife	used	to	kill	Deputy	Williams.	I	was	surprised	to	find	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	both	relieved	and	a	little	bit	disappointed.	For	a	minute	there,	I	thought	we had	a	good	lead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Should	we	all	go	look?”	Daniel	asked,	and	our	little	huddle	moved	back	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	co-op	and	around	the	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">None	of	us	but	the	sheriff	and	Divina	had	flashlights,	so	we	used	our	phones</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 search	 the	 ground.	 I	 checked	 right	 up	 against	 the	 building	 with	 the	 idea	 that that	kind	of	thing	can	easily	fall	in	the	transition	from	outside	to	inside	or	vice</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a>versa,	but	didn’t	find	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	I	started	to	fan	out,	searching	the	lot,	including	the	space	where	Divina said	 she	 usually	 parked.	 All	 of	 us	 looked	 and	 even	 wandered	 into	 the	 grass	 in case	 a	 squirrel	 or	 crow	 with	 a	 penchant	 for	 shiny	 things	 had	 tried	 to	 make	 off with	their	booty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	were	just	about	to	give	up	and	tell	Divina	we’d	take	a	sweep	again	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning	when	she	squealed	from	over	by	the	co-op’s	back	door.	“Oh,	I	found	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	right	here.”	She	pointed	to	a	spot	to	the	left	of	the	door.	“Thank	goodness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wouldn’t	have	wanted	some	child	to	pick	it	up	and	get	cut.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	walked	over	and	looked	at	the	knife	that	was	about	as	long	as	a	ballpoint</p>
<p class="calibre1">pen.	“So	weird.	I	looked	over	here	and	didn’t	see	it.”	I	stretched	my	back.	“But I’m	exhausted,	so	my	eyes	are	a	bit	wonky.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Divina	patted	my	arm.	“You’ve	had	a	busy	few	days,	and	an	even	busier	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">tomorrow,	 I	 suspect.	 We	 best	 all	 be	 getting	 home.	 Thank	 you	 all	 for	 your	 help and	kindness.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	headed	to	her	hot	pink	Volkswagen	beetle	and	climbed	in.	“I’ve	always</p>
<p class="calibre1">admired	that	about	Divina.	She’s	loaded,	but	the	only	sign	of	that	is	the	custom paint	job	on	her	very	sensible	car,”	Daniel	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	“Not	a	color	I’d	pick.”	Then	I	looked	at	the	sheriff.	“You</p>
<p class="calibre1">know	all	of	us	searched	that	spot	by	the	door,	right?	That	knife	was	not	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	at	me.	“I	did.	I	am	a	trained	police	officer.”	He	gave	me	a	wink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	yes,	that	is	odd.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	she	found	it	in	her	bag	while	she	was	searching	and	felt	embarrassed</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	she	fake-dropped	it.”	Mart	didn’t	sound	convinced	by	her	own	theory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe,”	the	sheriff	said	with	a	worried	look	on	his	face.	“Maybe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a><b class="calibre3">12</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I collapsed	into	bed	as	soon	as	I	got	home.	I	was	exhausted	from	work	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">planning	the	street	fair.	But	more,	I	was	just	worn	down	by	the	weight	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	 this	 sleuthing.	 The	 sheriff	 must	 be	 tired	 all	 the	 time,	 I	 thought.	 I	 felt Aslan	 climb	 up	 next	 to	 me	 –	 forsaking	 Marcus,	 it	 seemed	 –	 just	 before	 I	 fell asleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	felt	like	I’d	only	been	asleep	a	few	minutes	when	I	wrenched	my	body	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	a	start	and	felt	a	strain	in	my	shoulder.	I	was	gasping	and	covered	in	sweat, and	Aslan	was	sitting	at	the	end	of	the	bed	staring	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dream	had	been	so	real.	I	was	in	the	bookstore	by	myself	shelving	books</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	just	generally	cleaning	up	after	the	day	when	I	heard	a	thud	from	the	back	of the	store.	Thinking	Mayhem	had	knocked	a	book	off	the	shelf,	I	casually	walked back	 to	 pick	 it	 up	 when	 a	 hand	 reached	 around	 and	 grabbed	 me	 by	 the	 face, silencing	me	and	cutting	off	my	airways	all	at	the	same	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 my	 dream,	 I	 thrashed	 and	 kicked	 and	 tried	 to	 scream,	 but	 the	 person attached	 to	 the	 hand	 was	 far	 stronger	 than	 I	 was.	 I	 couldn’t	 get	 free.	 They dragged	me	into	the	storeroom	and	locked	the	door,	and	when	I	looked	up,	it	was Lucia	Stevensmith.	She	was	clearly	still	dead,	but	she	was	also	clearly	angry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	need	to	figure	out	who	did	this	to	me.	You	and	your	stupid	books	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	stupid	store	in	this	stupid	town.	Figure	it	out	so	you	can	get	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	voice	was	so	angry	that	it	stung.	“I’m	not	leaving	St.	Marin’s,	hopefully</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever.	So	I	guess	you’re	stuck	with	me.”	I	was	impressed	and	terrified	by	my	own</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a><img src="index-152_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">valor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lucia	came	and	stuck	a	bony	finger	in	my	face.	“You’re	digging	up	stories</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	needed	to	stay	untold,	woman.	Stop	poking	at	the	past.	Let	it	die.	We	don’t need	to	dredge	up	old	history.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stared	at	her	for	a	long	while,	and	then,	she	just	evaporated	.	.	.	and	that’s when	 I	 woke	 up.	 I	 drew	 Aslan	 to	 me	 and	 sat	 snuggling	 her	 for	 a	 long	 time, despite	 her	 desire	 to	 sleep	 in	 a	 ball	 on	 the	 extra	 pillow.	 My	 subconscious	 was obviously	 trying	 to	 tell	 me	 something,	 but	 I	 couldn’t	 put	 my	 finger	 on	 what about	the	past	I	was	missing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	clock	said	it	was	two	a.m.,	and	I	had	to	be	at	the	store	by	seven.	I’d	have to	 figure	 out	 what	 Lucia	 didn’t	 want	 me	 to	 put	 together	 another	 time.	 Now,	 I needed	to	sleep,	and	Aslan	agreed.	I	snuggled	back	under	the	comforter,	and	she rolled	 over	 to	 rest	 her	 haunches	 against	 the	 back	 of	 my	 leg.	 Comforting,	 if	 not entirely	comfortable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">LATER	 THAT	 MORNING,	 I	 awoke	 to	 my	 alarm.	 My	 body	 ached	 from	 exhaustion, but	my	mind	was	not	going	to	let	me	sleep	a	minute	past	six.	We	had	work	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 crawled	 out	 of	 bed	 and	 made	 my	 way	 to	 the	 coffee	 pot,	 only	 to	 find	 it	 was already	brewing.	I	tried	to	open	my	eyes	enough	to	look	around,	but	I	ran	into Marcus,	 who	 was	 sitting	 at	 a	 bar	 stool	 with	 his	 own	 cup	 of	 joe,	 reading <i class="calibre4">Possession</i>.	“Oh,	sorry,”	I	said.	“You’re	up	early.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wanted	to	 get	 an	early	 start	 at	the	 shop,	 but	 first,	I	 had	 to	read	 a	 bit	more about	what	Roland	and	Maud	are	finding.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	took	me	a	minute,	but	then	I	realized	he	was	talking	about	the	characters	in the	 novel	 and	 smiled.	 “Glad	 you’re	 liking	 it,	 and	 thanks	 for	 planning	 to	 come early.	We	have	a	LOT	of	setting	up	to	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	 problem.	 I	 hope	 it’s	 okay,	 but	 I	 asked	 my	 mom	 to	 come	 by,	 too.”	 He looked	over	the	top	of	his	book	with	trepidation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	it’s	okay.	I’m	so	excited	to	meet	her	.	.	.	but	if	you’ll	excuse	me,	I really	 need	 to	 drink	 some	 of	 this	 fine	 coffee	 you	 have	 made,	 and	 you	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a><img src="index-153_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">another	few	pages	to	squeeze	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	grinned	and	tucked	his	nose	back	into	his	book	while	I	dug	out	the	coffee</p>
<p class="calibre1">mug	 I’d	 won	 at	 a	 college	 holiday	 party.	 It	 was	 the	 size	 of	 a	 large	 soup	 bowl, which	seemed	about	right	for	today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">MART,	 Marcus,	 Daniel,	 and	 I	 were	 at	 the	 shop	 by	 seven,	 a	 time	 Aslan	 even refused	to	acknowledge	with	her	presence.	Mayhem,	however,	was	eager	to	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	for	an	early	morning	sniff-and-pee	until	we	got	to	the	shop,	that	is.	At	that point,	 she	 climbed	 onto	 the	 tiny	 dog	 bed	 in	 the	 window	 display	 –	 meant	 for	 a visiting	teacup	poodle	or	dog-loving	cat	–	and	passed	out.	Only	her	chest	fit	on the	bed,	so	she	made	quite	the	sight	with	her	belly	up,	all	four	paws	in	the	air, and	 this	 little	 pink	 pillow	 below	 her	 shoulders.	 I	 took	 a	 picture	 and	 decided	 it would	be	the	first	image	on	the	Instagram	page	I	wanted	to	create	for	the	shop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	 seven-thirty,	 Rocky	 and	 her	 mom	 had	 arrived	 with	 trays	 and	 trays	 of baked	 goods.	 “Gifts	 from	 the	 ladies	 at	 church,”	 Ms.	 Phoebe	 said.	 “You	 know those	women	are	always	just	looking	for	an	excuse	to	bake.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 laughed	 and	 said,	 “Please	 thank	 them	 for	 me.	 You’ll	 keep	 track	 of	 what	 I owe	everyone?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Phoebe	took	a	step	back.	“Woman,	no.	These	are	gifts.	All	the	money	goes	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	scholarship	fund.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 already	 felt	 the	 tears	 coming	 to	 my	 eyes,	 and	 we	 hadn’t	 even	 started	 the day.	“That	is	so	kind.	Maybe	I	could	host	a	women’s	book	club	for	them	here	.	.	. </p>
<p class="calibre1">do	they	like	to	read?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled.	“Some	of	them	do.	But	don’t	tell	the	preacher,	now:	most	of	us</p>
<p class="calibre1">love	romances.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 got	 it,	 then.	 A	 clandestine	 romance	 book	 club	 that	 we’ll	 call,	 “Lovin’</p>
<p class="calibre1">On”	just	to	seem	holy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	arched	her	back	and	laughed	so	loudly	that	I	felt	it	in	my	throat.	I	liked this	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside,	 Marcus	 had	 gotten	 all	 the	 tents	 set	 up	 and	 had	 hung	 two	 banners</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>that	 he	 had	 ordered	 the	 day	 before	 on	 the	 front	 and	 side	 of	 the	 building	 by	 the garden	center. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Used	Books	–	$1.00.	All	proceeds	go	to	the	Skye	Williams’	Scholarship	Fund.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">IN	THE	CORNER	of	each	banner,	there	was	a	small	stack	of	books	and	a	very	cute logo	for	the	shop	.	.	.	I’d	been	hoping	to	design	one,	but	apparently,	Marcus	had taken	care	of	that	for	me.	I	was	pretty	sure	that	young	man	would	be	the	assistant manager	here	before	long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Up	 and	 down	 the	 street,	 I	 saw	 the	 shop	 owners	 putting	 out	 tables	 and hanging	 decorations.	 The	 garden	 center	 had	 outdone	 themselves	 with	 the hanging	baskets	for	the	street	lamps,	and	the	town	had	offered	their	employees time	 and	 a	 half	 if	 they	 wanted	 to	 work	 the	 fair	 –	 hanging	 baskets,	 emptying trash,	 answering	 questions,	 etc.	 Already,	 the	 street	 was	 more	 full	 than	 on	 a normal	Sunday,	and	we	were	just	the	folks	working. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 heard	 the	 sheriff	 coming	 before	 I	 saw	 him.	 His	 patrol	 car	 was	 playing</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uptown	Funk”	over	the	loudspeaker	as	he	drove	into	town,	and	I	saw	even	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">most	 stoic	 among	 us	 start	 to	 swing	 our	 hips.	 I	 was	 outside	 helping	 Cate	 and Lucas	 unload	 their	 totes	 of	 books,	 and	 the	 sheriff	 stopped	 and	 rolled	 down	 his window	when	he	saw	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 done	 good,	 Harvey	 Beckett.	 Real	 good.”	 He	 grinned.	 “This	 is	 a	 great day	already	.	.	.	and	I	have	it	on	good	authority	that	the	weather	is	going	to	be perfect.”	He	leaned	out	of	the	car	window	and	winked	at	Woody. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 right.	 Red	 sky	 last	 night	 .	 .	 .	 sure	 does	 look	 like	 it’ll	 be	 delightful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	even	hit	seventy	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I	hope	so,”	I	said	as	I	waved	to	the	sheriff’s	departing	car.	I	was	trying to	figure	out	how	to	best	display	Cate’s	beautiful	art	book	collection.	“These	are incredible,	Cate.	Are	you	sure	you’re	okay	with	parting	with	them?	“</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cate	gave	me	a	look	that	said,	“This	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a>“Okay.	Okay.	But	really,	only	a	dollar?	We	could	get	more	for	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 looked	 at	 the	 books	 and	 said,	 “We	 could,	 but	 we	 don’t	 need	 to.	 And	 I really	like	the	idea	of	people	who	don’t	have	fifty	dollars	to	spend	on	an	art	book getting	 one	 for	 just	 a	 dollar.	 I	 plan	 on	 staying	 here	 all	 day	 and	 telling	 people about	the	artists	and	answering	questions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	 don’t	 scare	 the	 customers	 away,	 my	 love,”	 Lucas	 said	 as	 he	 hefted another	tote	onto	a	table.	“Not	everyone	wants	to	know	about	the	reason	behind Frida’s	unibrow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait,	 she	 had	 that	 facial	 hair	 for	 a	 reason?	 Oh	 man,	 I	 want	 to	 know	 that story,	 but	 I	 have	 to	 get	 inside.	 I	 just	 remembered,	 I	 haven’t	 gotten	 out	 the mystery	books	yet.	Tell	me	later?”	I	waved	as	I	rushed	back	into	the	shop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside,	I	stopped	in	my	tracks	when	I	saw	what	Mart	had	done	with	the	front</p>
<p class="calibre1">table.	 It	 was	 an	 entire	 display	 of	 books	 about	 segregation	 and	 the	 Jim	 Crow South,	and	at	the	center,	she’d	placed	 <i class="calibre4">The	Negro	Motorist	Green	Book</i>.	Its	forest-green	cover	shone	like	a	beacon,	and	I	wondered	how	people	would	feel	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hoped	our	black	customers	would	find	it	honoring,	especially	given	the	history of	 the	 building.	 A	 couple	 of	 days	 ago,	 I’d	 looked	 it	 up	 and	 found	 that	 they’d made	a	reproduction	of	the	1940	book	.	.	.	and	Mart	had,	somehow,	managed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	copies	to	feature	here	in	the	shop.	I	loved	that	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 couldn’t	 wait	 to	 show	 Divina,	 and	 I	 sure	 hoped	 Mr.	 Sylvester	 would	 stop by.	 I	 really	 wanted	 them	 to	 know	 I’d	 heard	 them	 and	 was	 doing	 all	 I	 could	 to honor	the	memory	of	Berkeley	Hudson.	As	I	rushed	past	the	check-out	counter,	I made	 a	 quick	 note	 to	 myself	 so	 I	 wouldn’t	 forget	 to	 take	 care	 of	 something	 as soon	as	the	festival	ended. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	now,	I	had	to	get	out	those	mystery	books	because	I	could	see	the	foot</p>
<p class="calibre1">traffic	 outside	 starting	 to	 pick	 up.	 I	 grabbed	 the	 box	 of	 books	 from	 the storeroom,	trying	not	to	think	about	Lucia	Stevensmith	when	I	darted	in	and	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">–	and	laid	the	box	on	the	table	for	Mart	to	sort.	“Got	it,”	she	said	as	I	sprinted	off to	check	on	Rocky	and	Phoebe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 mother-daughter	 team	 was	 in	 full	 swing	 with	 carafes	 of	 coffee	 –	 dark roast	and	medium	roast	in	the	full-strength	kind	plus	decaf	for	those	who	needed it	–	and	a	veritable	tower	of	cinnamon	rolls.	They’d	also	stocked	the	pastry	case</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>with	an	assortment	of	scones	and	spring-decorated	cookies,	and	I	thought	I	even spied	small	quiches	as	I	gave	them	a	big	thumbs	up	on	my	way	back	outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	darted	beneath	the	ringing	bell,	I	saw	Daniel	helping	Cate	and	Lucas	set</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	 the	 books,	 and	 he	 gave	 me	 a	 smile	 that	 made	 my	 heart	 bounce	 just	 a	 bit.	 I looked	up	the	street,	and	the	other	businesses	were	pulling	out	tables	and	setting up	displays	as	far	as	I	could	see.	Next	door,	the	garden	center	had	brought	out	a variety	 of	 hydrangea	 and	 viburnum.	 In	 front	 of	 the	 large	 shrubs,	 they	 placed smaller	 containers	 of	 these	 flowering	 bushes	 that	 had	 dark-green	 leaves	 and these	beautiful	purple	or	white	flowers	that	hung	gently	from	stems.	I	caught	the owner’s	eye	and	pointed,	“Hellebores,”	she	said.	“Lenten	rose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 grinned.	 I	 wasn’t	 much	 of	 a	 church-goer	 myself,	 but	 I	 did	 know	 that	 Fat Tuesday	was	coming	up,	and	if	their	name	was	any	indicator,	these	beauties	were blooming	right	on	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marcus,	Lucas,	Cate,	and	I	spent	the	better	part	of	the	next	hour	laying	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cate’s	 books,	 trying	 to	 organize	 them	 at	 least	 a	 bit	 into	 broad	 categories	 –</p>
<p class="calibre1">photography,	 painting,	 sculpture,	 etc.	 Fortunately,	 Lucas	 was	 able	 to	 convince Cate	 that	 we	 didn’t	 really	 have	 enough	 tables	 or	 space	 to	 break	 them	 down	 by genre	or	time	period,	or	else	we	might	have	been	sorting	when	the	street	festival ended. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	 about	 eight-thirty,	 I	 told	 Marcus	 I	 needed	 to	 check	 on	 Divina’s	 art and	decided	to	take	the	opportunity	to	walk	Mayhem	quickly	before	the	crowd</p>
<p class="calibre1">really	 arrived.	 Although,	 by	 the	 look	 of	 Main	 Street,	 people	 were	 already shopping,	 and	 some	 shop	 owners	 looked	 more	 than	 ready	 to	 begin	 their	 sales. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	older	gentlemen	who	owned	the	hardware	store	next	to	my	shop	had	put</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	 a	 collection	 of	 odds	 and	 ends	 that	 looked	 like	 they	 could	 draw	 in	 the <i class="calibre4">American	Pickers</i>.	A	bit	further	down	the	road,	I	noticed	that	Max	Davies	must have	 overcome	 his	 fear	 because	 he	 had	 a	 member	 of	 his	 waitstaff	 outside	 with coupons	 for	 twenty	 percent	 off	 an	 evening’s	 meal	 as	 well	 as	 surprisingly	 cute recipe	cards	for	a	chocolate	soufflé	and	his	Duck	a	l’Orange. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 folks	 at	 the	 hair	 salon	 were	 offering	 discounts	 on	 walk-in	 haircuts	 that day,	and	I	wished	I	had	time	to	stop	and	have	my	do	trimmed.	When	you	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">thick	curly	hair	cut	short	like	mine,	you	can’t	go	too	long	between	trims	or	you</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a>start	to	look	like	Lyle	Lovett.	That	guy’s	music	is	great,	and	the	hair	is	great	on him	.	.	.	not	so	much	on	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elle	 Heron	 had	 out	 vegetable	 starts	 –	 lettuce	 and	 broccoli,	 cabbage,	 and maybe	 kale.	 I	 never	 quite	 understood	 kale	 or	 the	 rage	 around	 it,	 but	 she	 was already	doing	a	brisk	business.	I	gave	her	a	little	wave	as	I	passed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	co-op,	a	young	man	with	the	largest	ear	gauges	I’d	ever	seen	was	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">opening	the	door,	and	he	said,	“Ms.	Beckett?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	that’s	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ms.	 Stevensmith	 wanted	 me	 to	 let	 you	 know	 that	 her	 piece	 is	 here	 and	 to show	you	where	it	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	good.	Thanks!”	I	must	have	looked	worried	because	he	gave	my	arm	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	squeeze	as	he	walked	past	me	to	lead	the	way	down	the	hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	there	it	was,	right	in	the	middle	of	the	main	gallery	space	at	the	center</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 building.	 The	 piece	 was	 exquisite	 –	 exquisite	 and	 huge.	 It	 stood	 almost two	 stories	 tall,	 reaching	 up	 to	 the	 bottom	 of	 the	 handrail	 on	 the	 second-floor catwalk	 above.	 The	 colors	 were	 stunning	 –	 all	 pinks	 and	 purples,	 some	 gentle blues	–	all	pieces	of	paper	cut	and	folded	to	give	the	appearance	of	movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	the	piece	was	a	study	of	our	town,	a	study	done	in	the	dark,	if	the	title was	 literal,	 and	 I	 could	 see	 it	 if	 I	 looked	 hard	 –	 the	 cupola	 on	 the	 top	 of	 the courthouse,	the	jettison	roof	of	the	maritime	museum,	even	the	thin	rails	of	ship masts	 lined	 up	 at	 the	 marina	 –	 but	 the	 beauty	 of	 the	 piece	 was	 that	 it	 could	 be almost	 anything	 the	 viewer	 wanted	 to	 see.	 One	 minute,	 I	 contemplated	 the flower-like	appearance	of	the	paperwork,	and	the	next	I	felt	like	I	was	looking	at the	 ocean	 after	 a	 nighttime	 squall.	 It	 was	 absolutely	 magnificent,	 and	 I	 found myself	unable	to	move	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	 you	 like	 it	 then?”	 Divina	 said	 as	 she	 came	 into	 the	 gallery	 and	 stood beside	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	at	her	with	awe.	“Like	it?	Ms.	Stevensmith,	it	is,	it	is	.	.	.	oh,	I	don’t even	have	the	right	words.	Incredible,	breath-taking,	poignant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 smiled	 and	 kept	 her	 eyes	 on	 her	 art.	 “It	 is	 one	 of	 my	 favorites.”	 She glanced	quickly	at	me.	“I	know	that	probably	sounds	prideful	of	me	to	say,	but I’ve	 always	 thought	 that	 if	 an	 artist	 doesn’t	 love	 her	 work,	 then	 how	 could</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a><img src="index-158_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">anyone	else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled.	“I	completely	agree.	And	Divina	–	is	it	alright	if	I	call	you	Divina?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded.	“Thank	you.	I’m	so	grateful	for	your	gift.	You	didn’t	have	to	be	so generous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 smiled	 and	 then	 turned,	 and	 I	 thought	 I	 heard	 her	 say,	 “Oh,	 but	 I	 did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	she	moved	off	quickly,	so	I	didn’t	get	to	ask	her	what	she	meant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	glanced	down	at	my	watch.	8:50.	I	had	to	get	back.	I	thanked	the	man	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">desk,	 untied	 Mayhem	 from	 the	 light	 pole	 outside,	 and	 walked	 as	 quickly	 as	 I could	without	looking	ridiculous.	It	just	wouldn’t	do	for	me	to	be	late	to	my	own street	fair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	 NEXT	 TWO	 hours	 went	 by	 in	 a	 blur.	 Fortunately,	 Cate	 and	 Lucas	 had	 come with	 a	 cash	 box	 and	 plenty	 of	 change	 since	 they	 were	 doing	 a	 swift	 business outside,	 and	 I	 couldn’t	 spare	 a	 person	 to	 help	 them.	 Marcus	 was	 masterfully handling	the	Mystery	Book	table,	and	when	we’d	already	almost	sold	out,	I	sent him	to	the	children’s	section	to	get	more–	“Pick	the	ones	you	like.”	The	grin	on his	face	told	me	he	appreciated	my	trust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	wasn’t	doing	 tastings	until	eleven,	 but	already,	she	 had	folks	stopping by	 to	 ask	 about	 the	 wine	 and	 pick	 up	 a	 bottle	 or	 two,	 and	 when	 they	 needed refreshment,	they	got	coffee	and	a	cinnamon	roll	or	scone	from	Rocky	and	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">mom.	Business	was	brisk,	and	people	were	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile,	 I	 staffed	 the	 register	 and	 tried	 to	 –	 as	 politely	 and	 clearly	 as possible	–	point	customers	to	the	right	sections	for	the	books	they	were	seeking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Daniel	came	in	and	offered	to	run	the	register,	I	didn’t	even	take	the	time to	ask	him	if	he	knew	how	before	I	scampered	off	after	a	teenage	girl	who	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking	 for	 the	 new	 Leigh	 Bardugo	 title	 but	 was	 headed	 right	 for	 our	 small section	of	erotica. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 Sheriff	 Mason	 and	 his	 wife,	 Lu,	 arrived	 at	 noon	 with	 a	 full	 tray	 of tacos,	I	was	ecstatic.	“Bring	me	the	tacos,”	I	said	in	a	low,	growling	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sheriff	took	a	step	back	in	pretend	horror,	but	Lu	stepped	right	forward</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a>and	said,	“I	hear	that	voice.	That’s	the	voice	of	a	woman	with	a	business	to	run. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Give	that	woman	a	taco,	Tuck.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	ma’am,	don’t	want	anyone	else	getting	hurt	around	here,”	he	said	as	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaned	over	to	me	with	the	tray.	“Harvey,	this	is	amazing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shoved	half	a	taco	in	my	face,	and	then	said,	“Thanf	oo	or	uh	baffos.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	laughed.	“You’re	most	welcome.	You	eat.	I’m	going	to	deliver	the	rest	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	 to	 the	 crew.”	 He	 kissed	 his	 wife	 on	 the	 cheek	 and	 headed	 out	 to	 play waiter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	finished	my	taco	in	record	speed	and	took	a	deep	breath.	“Seriously,	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">tacos	are	incredible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why,	thank	you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait.	I	know	these	tacos.	What?!	You	run	the	taco	truck?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indeed	 I	 do.	 Lu	 is	 short	 for	 Luisa.	 .	 .	 as	 in	 Luisa’s	 Lunch	 Luxury.”	 She grinned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	I	remembered.	That	was	the	name	on	the	taco	truck	.	.	.	painted	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">swirling	 script	 above	 a	 woman’s	 face,	 Lu’s	 face	 I	 realized.	 “Well,	 if	 I	 didn’t already	plan	to	be	in	St.	Marin’s	for	a	very	long	time,	your	tacos	would	be	the deciding	factor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	 then,	 Daniel	 walked	 over,	 a	 taco	 in	 each	 hand	 and	  <i class="calibre4">the</i>	 Taco	 trailing behind.	“Daniel,	do	you	know	Lu	Mason?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	at	his	hands	and	then	made	quick	work	of	one	taco	before	shaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lu’s	 hand.	 “I	 don’t	 know	 you	 personally,	 but	 I	 have	 eaten	 many	 of	 your jalapeno-chicken	tacos.	Thank	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	yes,	the	mechanic.	My	young	assistant	knows	you	well.”	She	raised	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyebrows	at	Daniel,	and	I	felt	my	heart	rate	quicken.	I	had	competition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	 yes,	 I	 know	 your	 assistant.	 Long	 blond	 hair,	 beautiful	 brown	 eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">About	eighteen	inches	tall.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lu	laughed,	but	I	wasn’t	getting	the	joke.	“Yes,	that’s	her.	Sandy	is	a	sucker for	a	dark-haired	man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 smile	 had	 fallen	 away,	 and	 I	 was	 looking	 from	 Lu	 to	 Daniel	 and	 back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	 took	 a	 step	 over	 and	 stood	 beside	 me,	 letting	 his	 arm	 fall	 casually	 over my	shoulder.	“Harvey’s	a	dog	lover,	too.	That’s	her	girl	Mayhem	over	there	with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>my	Taco.”	He	pointed	over	to	the	bed	beside	the	fiction	section. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	it	clicked.	Sandy	was	a	dog.	I	was	fairly	sure	my	face	was	the	color	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lu’s	enchilada	sauce.	At	least	my	heart	was	beating	again.	“What	kind	of	dog	is Sandy?”	I	asked	trying	to	look	like	jealousy	hadn’t	been	keeping	all	my	synapses from	firing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 she’s	 a	 Cocker	 Spaniel.	 Spoiled	 as	 anything.	 Every	 night,	 Tuck	 gives her	 a	 serving	 of	 my	 tres	 leches	 cake.	 Soon,	 I’ll	 have	 to	 get	 a	 cart	 to	 carry	 her because	her	belly	will	drag	the	ground.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	laughed.	“She	is	a	little	portly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	little	portly.	You	are	kind.	If	she	gets	fatter,	she’ll	be	round,	and	we’ll	be able	to	just	roll	her	around	town.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	laughing	so	hard	that	I	almost	didn’t	notice	when	Galen	Gilbert	came</p>
<p class="calibre1">in.	 If	 he	 hadn’t	 stopped	 to	 pet	 Mayhem	 and	 Taco	 on	 his	 way	 to	 the	 mystery section,	I	might	have	missed	him	altogether. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 was	 nice	 to	 meet	 you,	 Lu.	 Maybe	 I	 can	 try	 some	 of	 Sandy’s	 tres	 leches cake	some	time,”	I	said	as	I	scooted	after	Galen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 had	 already	 scooped	 up	 a	 handful	 of	 mass	 markets	 –	 mostly	 culinary cozies	 this	 time,	 I	 noticed.	 I	 slipped	 a	 copy	 of	 Avery	 Aames	  <i class="calibre4">The	 Long	 Quiche</i> <i class="calibre4">Goodbye</i>	 onto	 the	 top	 of	 his	 pile	 before	 he	 noticed	 me,	 and	 when	 he	 glanced down,	he	smiled.	“Oh,	I	love	that	series.”	Only	then	did	he	look	up	to	see	who had	placed	the	book	on	his	teetering	stack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harvey.	You	have	good	taste	in	mysteries.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	grinned.	“Thanks.	I	just	love	a	punny	title	.	.	.	and	Providence,	Ohio,	is	one of	my	favorite	towns	where	people	die	all	the	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Galen	roared.	“Yes,	goodness,	if	the	murder	rates	were	as	high	in	major	cities as	they	are	in	these	fictional	small	towns,	we’d	run	out	of	cemeteries.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	me	take	these	for	you,	hold	them	at	the	desk	if	that’s	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course.	Thank	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	Galen.	Really,	thank	you.	You	gave	us	a	huge	gift	in	sharing	a	piece	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	Insta	feed	with	us.	Our	business	has	been	booming	for	much	better	reasons now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	down	at	the	bookshelves	again.	“It’s	the	least	I	could	do.	I	want</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>more	people	to	read,	and	I	think	small	bookshops	like	yours	are	part	of	the	key to	helping	that	happen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	thank	you.	Now,	what	brings	you	to	town	today?	I	thought	you	were	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">usual	Tuesday	visitor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	with	me	back	to	the	counter,	where	Daniel	was	managing	the	line</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	aplomb.	“I	am,	but	I	read	about	the	street	fair	on	 <i class="calibre4">your</i>	Instagram	feed	and couldn’t	miss	it.	Besides,	on	Tuesday,	I	have	to	run	another	errand	so	can’t	come then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	face	had	grown	serious,	so	I	put	his	books	down	beside	Daniel	and	took</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	step	closer	to	Galen.	“Everything	okay?	I	mean	I	don’t	want	to	pry—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">His	chin	shot	up,	and	I	saw	a	glint	of	mischief	in	his	eye.	“Oh	yes,	I	just	have a	date	that	afternoon	is	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	date.	Ooh	la	la.	Who’s	the	lucky	woman?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	Bulldog	named	Mack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	cackled.	“As	in	Mack	the	Mack	Truck	spokesdog?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 the	 one.	 He’s	 at	 the	 local	 SPCA,	 and	 I’ve	 decided	 I	 need	 a roommate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 Galen,	 when	 Mack	 is	 ready	 for	 primetime,	 I	 hope	 you’ll	 bring	 him by.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	he’ll	be	here	for	mystery	Tuesdays,	don’t	you	worry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	helped	Daniel	bag	Galen’s	purchases	and	then	told	Galen	I	looked	forward</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	seeing	Mack’s	introduction	on	Insta.	He	grinned,	winked,	and	headed	toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	door	before	turning	and	saying,	“Oh,	I	want	to	bid	on	that	art	piece.	How	do	I do	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	 stepped	 forward.	 “I	 have	 to	 walk	 that	 way	 to	 get	 something	 at	 my garage.	I’ll	show	you	.	.	.	besides,	I	want	to	take	a	peek	myself.”	Daniel	winked as	he	held	the	door	open	for	Galen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	minutes	later,	Ralph	Sylvester	stepped	through	the	doors	of	the	shop, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 immediately,	 I	 saw	 a	 smile	 cross	 over	 his	 face	 as	 he	 stood	 in	 front	 of	 the display	Mart	had	put	together.	He	lifted	a	copy	of	 <i class="calibre4">The	Green	Book</i>	and	gently	let the	 pages	 spin	 past	 his	 fingers.	 Then,	 he	 set	 it	 back	 down	 carefully,	 gazed	 at	 it another	minute,	and	then	picked	up	a	copy	of	Isabel	Wilkerson’s	 <i class="calibre4">The	Warmth	of</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a> <i class="calibre4">Other	 Suns</i>	 before	 heading	 to	 the	 armchair	 next	 to	 Mayhem	 and	 Taco	 and beginning	to	read. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	around	the	rest	of	the	store	–	most	of	the	chairs	were	full	of	people reading	 or	 talking	 with	 one	 another.	 The	 café	 was	 buzzing,	 and	 Mart’s	 tasting line	was	impressive,	even	with	the	extra	help	she’d	called	in	from	the	winery.	As Marcus	 swung	 by	 after	 doing	 a	 quick	 pick-up	 of	 the	 store,	 I	 asked	 him	 to	 take over	the	register	so	I	could	step	out	and	take	a	look	at	the	fair	and	see	how	Cate and	Lucas	were	doing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	walked	out	onto	the	sidewalk,	I	took	a	deep	breath	of	warm	spring</p>
<p class="calibre1">air.	 It	 was	 gorgeous	 out	 here.	 The	 sun	 was	 sharing	 her	 perfect	 spring	 glow, making	 everything	 sparkle	 just	 a	 bit,	 and	 I	 figured	 the	 temperature	 was	 in	 the mid-sixties.	 I	 couldn’t	 have	 ordered	 a	 better	 weather	 day.	 The	 sheriff	 had	 been right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 gave	 Cate	 a	 wave	 as	 I	 stepped	 out	 into	 the	 street	 and	 looked	 back	 at	 the shop.	She	was	busy	telling	people	about	her	books,	and	I	could	see	Lucas	nearby doing	the	same.	Several	people	had	stacks	of	books	in	their	hands,	and	the	smile on	Cate’s	face	confirmed	that	she	was	happy	to	have	made	the	decision	to	donate her	books	for	the	scholarship	fund. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	middle	of	the	road	was	full	of	people	–	many	with	cups	of	coffee	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	café	and	the	other	restaurants	–	and	I	noticed	a	fair	number	of	cinnamon	rolls and	 the	 tell-tale	 remnants	 of	 icing	 on	 a	 few	 faces.	 Most	 of	 all,	 though,	 people looked	happy	.	.	.	that	kind	of	happy	that	comes	when	you	are	outside	on	the	first warm	day	of	spring,	when	you	have	the	promise	of	a	garden	to	plant	and	picnics to	 plan,	 when	 everything	 feels	 like	 it’s	 opening	 up	 after	 the	 long,	 dark	 days	 of winter.	 Right	 then	 and	 there,	 I	 decided	 this	 would	 have	 to	 be	 an	 annual	 affair, and	 I	 thought	 how	 lovely	 it	 would	 be	 to	 schedule	 it	 the	 same	 time	 we	 did	 the Welcome	to	Spring	event	at	the	shop.	Maybe	call	the	whole	thing	The	Welcome</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	Spring	fair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 was	 letting	 myself	 daydream	 about	 Stephen	 and	 Walter	 coming	 in	 to coordinate	the	event,	maybe	even	construct	a	small	stage	for	music	at	the	end	of the	road,	and	seeing	Galen	as	our	media	chair	with	Marcus	managing	the	shop</p>
<p class="calibre1">while	I	coordinated	the	readers	and	advertising.	I	could	feel	myself	smiling	as	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a>realized	that	all	my	hard	work	over	the	past	six	months,	that	the	utter	change	in my	life	since	moving	from	San	Francisco,	had	been	worth	it	in	every	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	content. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then,	I	heard	the	shouting.	It	was	coming	from	up	the	street,	just	beside</p>
<p class="calibre1">Max	Davies’	shop.	“You	enabled	her,	you	old	coot.”	Max	was	angry.	His	voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	all	screechy,	and	clearly,	he	wasn’t	worried	about	drawing	negative	attention because	his	voice	could	beat	the	band. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 hurried	 over,	 hoping	 to	 diffuse	 the	 situation	 before	 the	 pleasant	 mood	 of this	 Sunday	 morning	 was	 disturbed.	 In	 front	 of	 Chez	 Cuisine,	 I	 found	 Max towering	over	Divina	Stevensmith,	who	looked	both	furious	and	dangerous.	Her</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands	were	bunched	at	her	sides,	and	she	had	drawn	herself	up	to	her	full	height so	she	could	get	closer	to	Max’s	face	as	he	screamed	at	her.	“You	should	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">reined	her	in.	She	was	your	daughter,”	Max	shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	you	 <i class="calibre4">dare</i>	tell	me	how	I	should	have	raised	my	daughter,	you	ingrate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	have	no	idea!”	All	my	interactions	with	Divina	had	given	me	a	sense	of	her as	 a	 quiet,	 almost	 meek	 woman,	 but	 now,	 I	 was	 seeing	 her	 warrior	 side,	 and	 it was	scary.	I	couldn’t	help	but	root	for	her	though,	after	all	the	man	was	insulting her	daughter,	her	dead	daughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	 voices	 were	 getting	 louder	 as	 they	 continued	 to	 hurl	 insults	 at	 one another,	and	the	crowd	was	gathering	from	up	and	down	the	street. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Oh	man</i>,  <i class="calibre4">	this	isn’t	good</i>,	I	thought.	The	last	thing	we	needed	was	to	make	this about	murder	when	really	it	needed	to	be	about	the	 <i class="calibre4">life</i>	of	Deputy	Williams. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	when	I	thought	I	was	going	to	have	to	step	in	and	break	it	up,	Elle	Heron rushed	over	and	stood	between	Max	and	Divina.	I	stepped	closer	with	the	idea	of providing	 her	 back-up,	 but	 she	 didn’t	 need	 me.	 In	 a	 low,	 growl	 of	 a	 voice,	 she said,	“You	two	are	making	a	scene.	Max,	go	back	inside.	I’ll	come	talk	to	you	in a	minute.”	She	glared	at	him	until	he	stomped	his	foot	like	a	three-year-old	and then	went	into	his	restaurant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elle	then	took	Divina	by	the	arm	and	led	her	away	from	the	crowd,	who	had, </p>
<p class="calibre1">thankfully,	 already	 started	 to	 disperse	 once	 the	 spectacle	 was	 over.	 I	 followed behind	the	two	women,	hoping	I	might	be	able	to	comfort	Divina,	get	her	a	glass of	water	or	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a>As	I	got	closer	behind	them,	I	heard	Elle	say,	“Seriously,	you	have	the	gall	to cause	a	scene.	You!	You	think	no	one	knows,	but	I	know.	I	know	Divina.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	tiny,	older	woman	looked	at	her	and	said,	“If	you	know,	then,	you	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	not	someone	to	be	trifled	with.	You	best	mind	yourself,	Elle.	I	will	do	what	I need	to	do.”	Then	Divina	strode	off	back	toward	the	co-op	without	so	much	as	a backward	glance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	no	idea	what	I’d	just	heard,	but	I	didn’t	think	Divina	had	meant	for	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	hear	that	threat.	Elle	looked	pretty	shaken	–	but	from	anger	or	fear	I	couldn’t tell.	Still,	I	had	to	know	what	she	knew,	so	I	slid	up	behind	her	and	laid	a	hand between	her	shoulder	blades.	She	jumped	and	let	out	a	little	squeal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	Elle,	I’m	so	sorry,”	I	said	as	I	stepped	around	in	front	of	her	with	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands	up.	“I	just	heard	what	Divina	said	and	wanted	to	be	sure	you	were	okay.”	I could	see	the	tears	pooled	in	her	eyes,	but	I	wasn’t	sure	they	were	there	because	I startled	her	or	because	of	what	Divina	had	said.	“What’s	going	on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	around	quickly	and	then	took	my	elbow	and	led	me	to	her	shop</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 then	 into	 the	 back	 cooler	 where	 she	 kept	 the	 flowers.	 I	 shivered.	 I’d	 had	 a bad	experience	in	a	cooler	once,	and	given	the	circumstances,	I	didn’t	love	being in	 here	 with	 Elle,	 although	 it	 was	 looking	 less	 and	 less	 like	 she	 was	 actually	 a suspect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Divina	can’t	know	I	was	talking	to	you	about	this.	It’ll	put	you	in	danger.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait,	what?!	Danger?	Are	you	in	danger?	From	Divina?	What	is—?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	put	a	finger	up	to	her	lips.	“I’ll	explain.	Just	can	I	get	a	minute	to	catch my	breath?”	She	gave	me	a	little	smile	as	she	sat	down	on	a	chair	in	the	corner and	 started	 selecting	 stems	 of	 flowers	 from	 the	 five-gallon	 buckets	 at	 her	 feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	hands	were	shaking,	but	she	selected	each	blossom	with	attention	and	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">arranged	it	skillfully	in	her	fingers.	By	the	time	she	had	a	glorious	pastel	bouquet of	pink	roses,	baby’s	breath,	and	hyacinth,	her	hands	were	steady	again,	and	she looked	up	at	me.	“I	think	Divina	Stevensmith	murdered	her	daughter	and	Deputy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Williams.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	around,	saw	an	empty	bucket,	and	turned	it	over	as	a	seat.	I	needed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 sit	 down.	 “Does	 she	 know	 that	 you	 suspect	 her?”	 I	 had	 about	 five	 thousand other	questions,	but	I	figured	she’d	get	to	the	answers	soon	enough,	now	that	she</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a>was	talking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	imagine	she	does	now.	I	shouldn’t	have	intervened	back	there,	at	least	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	way,	but	I	didn’t	want	her	ruining	this	day.	It’s	so	beautiful,	and	you	worked so	hard.”	She	looked	up	at	me,	and	I	could	see	the	tears	in	her	eyes	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	reached	over	and	took	the	bouquet	from	her	and	slipped	it	into	a	vase	full	of water	 on	 a	 small	 table	 beside	 her.	 Then	 I	 slid	 my	 bucket	 closer	 and	 held	 her hands.	“Oh,	Elle.	So	the	articles	Cate	saw?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	let	out	a	raspy	laugh.	“I	wondered	if	that’s	why	you	all	had	come	back	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 day.	 Yeah,	 I	 was	 doing	 a	 little	 investigating,	 following	 a	 hunch.	 That	 day you	 came	 to	 ask	 about	 the	 flowers,	 I’d	 seen	 Divina	 back	 behind	 your	 shop, poking	around.	I	asked	her	if	she’d	lost	something,	and	she	said	she’d	dropped	a pair	of	scissors.	We	looked	for	a	while	but	didn’t	find	them.	It	was	only	when	I got	 back	 here	 that	 I	 thought	 to	 wonder	 why	 she’d	 had	 scissors	 near	 your	 shop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	got	me	thinking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	Divina	had	pulled	the	same	thing	on	us	the	previous	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	told	Elle	that	story,	and	we	sat	quietly	for	a	while.	“The	articles	were	research then,	but	not	about	Lucia.	About	her	mom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right.	I	was	trying	to	figure	out	why	Divina	would	kill	her	own	daughter, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 I	 didn’t	 see	 anything	 that	 made	 sense.”	 She	 studied	 her	 fingernails.	 “Then, when	 Deputy	 Williams	 got	 killed,	 it	 suddenly	 felt	 really	 unsafe.	 I	 mean,	 if	 she could	kill	twice	.	.	.	“	She	looked	up	at	me	with	shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	just	what	you	mean.”	I	leaned	back	on	my	bucket	and	stretched	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">back.	“Okay,	but	now	we	need	a	cover	story,	something	that	makes	sense	of	what you	just	said	to	Divina,	something	that	will	get	you	out	of	her	cross-hairs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elle	 nodded.	 “Or	 at	 least	 be	 believable	 enough	 that	 other	 people	 will	 think that’s	 what	 we’re	 fighting	 about.	 I	 can’t	 be	 sure,	 but	 something	 tells	 me	 that Divina	just	wants	to	keep	her	secret	from	going	public.	Maybe	she	doesn’t	care that	I	know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged.	“Maybe.	But	maybe	we	can	be	sure,	too.”	I	stood	up	and	paced</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	the	cooler	and	then	struck	on	something.	“What	if	I	went	over	there	and told	her	you	felt	terrible	about	accusing	her,	that	you	thought	she	was	trying	to steal	the	attention	away	from	Deputy	Williams	with	her	donation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a>Elle	looked	skeptical.	“Do	you	think	she’ll	buy	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe.	I	mean	I	think	I	can	convince	her.	She’s	so	private	and	this	donation</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 so	 out	 of	 the	 ordinary—”	 I	 stopped	 mid-sentence	 because	 I	 just	 realized something.	“She	feels	guilty.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	Elle	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	 donated	 her	 work	 of	 art	 because	 she	 feels	 guilty	 about	 killing	 Deputy Williams.	I’m	sure	of	it.”	I	headed	toward	the	cooler	door.	“That	makes	perfect sense.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elle	trailed	after	me.	“It	does,	but	we	still	don’t	know	why	she	did	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	right.	Motive	still	wasn’t	clear,	but	I	imagined	Sheriff	Mason	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	more	sense	of	that.	But	first,	I	needed	to	be	sure	Elle	was	safe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gave	her	a	quick	hug,	told	her	to	come	by	the	shop	when	she	closed	up	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	night,	and	that	we’d	make	a	plan	from	there.	Then,	I	headed	to	the	co-op	in the	hopes	that	I’d	find	Divina	in	her	studio. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a><b class="calibre3">13</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	kid	with	the	gauges	in	his	ears	was	still	on	duty,	and	when	I	told	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	hoping	to	see	Ms.	Stevensmith,	he	didn’t	bat	an	eye	and	took	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">right	back	to	her	studio.	“She	doesn’t	usually	like	to	be	disturbed.”	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	it	with	casual	ease,	as	if	it	didn’t	matter	to	him	if	artists	needed	privacy	or not.	Given	the	circumstances,	neither	did	I. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 knocked	 lightly	 on	 the	 door	 and	 then	 tried	 the	 knob.	 It	 was	 open,	 so	 I stepped	in	and	saw	Divina	with	her	scissors	working	at	her	counter.	She	glanced up	and	then	went	right	back	to	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	heard	about	the	incident	on	the	street?”	she	said	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	did.	I	actually	heard	the	incident.”	I	took	a	deep	breath	and	dug	deep	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	best	sincere	voice.	“Are	you	okay?	You	seemed	pretty	upset.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	acting	must	have	worked	because	she	put	down	her	scissors	and	laid	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands	 on	 the	 waist-high	 counter	 in	 front	 of	 her	 and	 sighed.	 “That	 Max	 Davies pushes	my	buttons.	Can’t	let	anything	go.”	She	winced	at	her	own	words,	but	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t	 very	 well	 ask	 why.	 “One	 review	 in	 that	 newspaper,	 and	 he	 was	 after Lucia	 all	 the	 time.	 My	 daughter	 was	 not	 a	 kind	 human	 being.	 I’m	 not	 denying that.	 But	 his	 escargot	 is	 kind	 of	 chewy.”	 She	 let	 out	 a	 breathy	 laugh,	 and	 I relaxed	a	little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	“Yeah,	he	does	seem	kind	of	incensed	about	something	from,	what,	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">few	years	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	up	abruptly	then.	“Well,	time	doesn’t	heal	all	wounds,	my	dear. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>But	 this	 wound	 of	 Max’s,	 it’s	 pretty	 petty.”	 She	 came	 around	 the	 desk,	 and	 I double-checked	to	be	sure	the	scissors	stayed	behind.	I	was	glad	to	see	them	on the	 counter.	 “Sit.”	 She	 pointed	 to	 two	 club	 chairs	 covered	 in	 red	 fabric	 at	 the edge	of	the	studio. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	made	my	way	over,	being	sure	to	keep	myself	between	the	door	and	Divina, </p>
<p class="calibre1">even	 though	 I	 felt	 kind	 of	 silly.	 She	 sure	 didn’t	 come	 off	 like	 a	 cold-blooded killer,	and	right	now,	she	just	seemed	sad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	just	talked	to	Elle,”	I	almost	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	eyes	darted	to	mine	and	narrowed.	“Oh?	What	does	she	have	to	say	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 energy	 in	 the	 room	 had	 changed	 just	 like	 that.	 It	 was	 suddenly	 colder, sharper	 in	 here.	 “She’s	 sorry	 for	 accusing	 you	 of	 trying	 to	 steal	 the	 attention away	from	Deputy	Williams.	She	really	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Divina	 turned	 her	 head	 to	 look	 at	 me	 from	 the	 corner	 of	 her	 left	 eye.	 “Oh, right.	She	is?	Well,	that’s	good.”	I	could	hear	the	hesitation	in	her	voice,	as	if	she was	waiting	to	hear	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	explained	that	you’d	donated	the	piece	and	had	wanted	to	stay	out	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">limelight	as	much	as	possible,	that	you’d	even	insisted	on	not	being	a	part	of	the fair	directly	because	you	really	wanted	to	keep	the	focus	on	Deputy	Williams.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Divina	 was	 nodding	 and	 looking	 at	 me.	 “I	 told	 her	 your	 donation	 wasn’t	 about you	at	all,	but	about	taking	care	of	your	community.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled	then.	“Thank	you,	Harvey.	That’s	exactly	it.	If	anything,	I’d	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 have	 donated	 the	 work	 anonymously.	 Maybe	 I	 should	 have	 done	 that,	 but sometimes,”	she	looked	past	me	toward	the	door	of	the	studio,	“sometimes,	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	 need	 to	 put	 our	 names	 to	 things,	 claim	 our	 responsibility	 for	 them.	 You know?”	She	kicked	her	eyes	back	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	felt	like	something	was	being	said	that	wasn’t	being	said,	but	I	wasn’t	about to	 ask.	 “I	 do	 know.	 Absolutely.	 Anyway,	 I	 just	 wanted	 to	 come	 as	 an	 emissary for	 Elle,	 who	 feels	 so	 terrible	 that	 she	 was	 too	 ashamed	 to	 come	 talk	 to	 you herself.	I	hope	you’ll	forgive	her.”	I	stood	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Divina	stood	with	me.	“Of	course.	Some	slights	need	to	be	overlooked.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 faked	 a	 laugh	 that	 I	 hoped	 sounded	 more	 real	 than	 it	 felt.	 “Like	 chewy</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a><img src="index-169_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">escargot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly.”	She	held	the	door	open	for	me	as	I	left,	and	when	I	looked	back, </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	was	still	watching	me.	I	shivered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">BACK	 AT	 THE	 SHOP,	 Cate	 and	 Lucas’s	 sales	 were	 winding	 down	 as	 they	 tended the	shoppers	of	the	last	few	dozen	books.	I	caught	Cate’s	eye	as	I	passed,	pointed inside,	and	said,	“When	you	can.	No	rush.”	She	must	have	read	something	in	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">face	 because	 she	 handed	 the	 copy	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Black	 Book</i>,	 a	 collection	 of	 Robert Mapplethorpe’s	photography,	back	to	Lucas	and	followed	me	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	we	passed	the	café,	I	waved	to	Mart,	who	left	the	wine	table	to	follow	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gave	Daniel	a	quick	wave,	too,	and	asked	Marcus	to	take	over	the	register	for	a few	 minutes.	 Then,	 the	 four	 of	 us	 huddled	 in	 the	 back	 room	 while	 I	 told	 them about	 what	 Elle	 had	 found,	 what	 I	 suspected	 about	 the	 reason	 for	 the	 art donation,	and	my	conviction	that	Divina	Stevensmith	was	our	murderer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 the	 facts	 laid	 out	 like	 that,	 no	 one	 disagreed.	 “Nice	 work,	 Harvey,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	said,	“but	now,	it’s	time	to	call	the	sheriff.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait.”	I	could	hear	the	anxiety	in	my	voice.	It	felt	really	important	to	me	to figure	this	out.	“We	don’t	have	a	motive	yet.	And	there’s	no	physical	evidence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	 possibilities.”	 I	 wanted	 to	 tell	 the	 sheriff,	 but	 I	 also	 wanted	 to	 give	 him everything	he	needed.	After	all,	he’d	lost	his	deputy	and	friend	to	this	woman’s actions.	If	I	could	spare	him	the	pain	of	further	investigation	.	.	.	“Just	give	me until	tomorrow.	If	we	can’t	figure	it	out	by	then,	I’ll	call.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	 held	 his	 phone	 out	 in	 front	 of	 him,	 his	 finger	 still	 poised	 to	 hit	 the sheriff’s	 number	 in	 his	 contacts.	 But	 then	 Mart	 reached	 over	 and	 lowered	 his arm.	 “We’ll	 work	 together	 to	 figure	 it	 out,”	 she	 said,	 “and	 we	 won’t	 leave Harvey	alone	for	a	minute.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 smiled	 my	 best	 “I’ve	 got	 this”	 smile	 for	 Daniel,	 even	 though	 I	 could	 feel the	tension	in	my	shoulders	starting	to	creep	up	the	back	of	my	neck.	I	had	no idea	how	to	figure	this	out	by	tomorrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a><img src="index-170_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">WE	HEADED	BACK	out	onto	the	floor,	and	I	went	to	relieve	Marcus	at	the	register and	tell	him	to	go	take	a	break,	enjoy	the	nice	weather.	“Oh,	I’m	waiting	for	my mom.	She	texted	a	few	minutes	ago,	said	she’d	be	here	soon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	as	if	on	cue,	this	gorgeous	black	woman	with	thin	braids	twisted	into	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">crown	 came	 through	 the	 door,	 and	 Marcus’s	 face	 lit	 up.	 “That	 her?”	 I	 asked behind	my	own	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep,”	 he	 looked	 at	 me	 as	 he	 headed	 toward	 his	 mom.	 “Do	 you	 mind	 if	 I introduce	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mind?	I’d	be	offended	if	you	didn’t.”	He	laughed	and	then	went	and	hugged</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 mother	 before	 bringing	 her	 over	 to	 the	 counter.	 “Mrs.	 Dawson,	 you	 have raised	one	fine	son.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	Ms.	Beckett.	I’m	glad	you	can	see	that,	too.”	She	reached	across</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	counter	to	shake	my	hand.	“And	thank	you,	too,	for	giving	Marcus	work,	and in	a	bookstore,	no	less.	You	know	this	boy	loves	books?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	yes,	ma’am,	I	do.	If	he’s	not	skating	or	working,	he’s	reading.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mrs.	Dawson	beamed.	“It’s	very	nice	to	meet	you,	Ms.	Beckett.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harvey,	please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harvey,	then.	Marcus,	you	keep	on	doing	your	thing.	I’m	going	to	browse.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	leaned	over	to	Marcus.	“You’re	due	a	break.	Why	don’t	you	give	your	mom</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	grand	tour?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	sure?	It’s	been	kind	of	busy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	got	it.”	I	pointed	behind	Marcus	toward	where	Daniel	was	getting	Taco</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	Mayhem	a	bowl	of	water.	“I	have	help	if	I	need	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marcus	 caught	 up	 to	 his	 mom,	 who	 had	 made	 a	 stop	 at	 the	 wine	 table	 first thing.  <i class="calibre4">My	kind	of	woman, </i> I	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	rest	of	the	afternoon	went	by	in	a	blur	of	activity.	Between	customers,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">tried	 to	 ponder	 what	 possible	 reason	 a	 woman	 could	 have	 for	 killing	 her	 own child,	but	I	kept	coming	up	empty.	Nothing	about	the	idea	of	Divina	killing	her daughter	 made	 much	 sense.	 I	 could	 see,	 however,	 why	 she	 might	 have	 killed Deputy	 Williams	 to	 cover	 up	 the	 first	 murder.	 If	 the	 deputy	 had	 come	 upon</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p171"></a>something	 incriminating	 –	 what	 that	 would	 be	 I	 hadn’t	 yet	 figured	 out	 either	 –</p>
<p class="calibre1">Divina	 might	 have	 acted	 just	 to	 “tie	 up	 loose	 ends”	 as	 they	 say	 on	 the	 TV</p>
<p class="calibre1">dramas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	end	of	the	day,	I	still	had	no	solid	motivation	for	why	Divina	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">kill	 Lucia	 Stevensmith,	 and	 it	 looked	 more	 and	 more	 like	 I’d	 have	 to	 tell	 the sheriff	everything	I	knew	in	the	morning.	But	I	still	had	a	few	hours,	and	I	was determined	to	make	the	most	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 4:45,	 I	 started	 our	 normal	 closing	 ritual.	 I	 walked	 around	 and	 told	 the remaining	 customers	 that	 we	 would	 be	 closing	 soon	 and	 asked	 them	 to	 bring their	final	purchases	to	the	registers.	I	turned	off	the	neon	sign	and	asked	Daniel to	scout	for	misplaced	books	and	reshelve	them.	I	peeked	in	and	saw	that	Rocky and	Phoebe	were	beginning	their	clean-up,	too,	and	when	Rocky	caught	my	eye, </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 whisper-shouted,	 “Best	 day	 yet.”	 I	 grinned.	 I	 was	 happy	 for	 her.	 Our arrangement	was	that	she	got	thirty	percent	of	the	take	from	the	café	as	well	as her	hourly	wage,	and	I	hoped	these	big	sale	days	were	helping	cover	the	costs	of her	next	semester	at	school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marcus	 and	 his	 mom	 had	 spent	 the	 better	 part	 of	 the	 afternoon</p>
<p class="calibre1">recommending	books	to	customers,	and	the	customers	were	thrilled.	They	were	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">power	duo,	passing	book	titles	back	and	forth	between	them	and	delighting	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">customers	with	the	depth	of	their	knowledge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	five	o’clock,	the	last	customer	headed	out,	and	I	locked	the	door	behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">them.	Ms.	Dawson	stopped	by	the	register	while	Marcus	helped	Daniel	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">reshelves.	 “I	 heard	 about	 Ms.	 Stevensmith,”	 Ms.	 Dawson	 said,	 a	 frown	 on	 her face.	“That	woman	had	done	me	no	kindness,	but	I	never	wished	her	ill	either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sad	what	happened	to	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded.	“It	is.	I’m	sorry	about	what	she	did	to	you,	though,	although	I	have to	admit	that	it	was	reading	about	that	story	and	then	hearing	about	Marcus’s,	er, situation	that	led	me	to	try	and	get	him	some	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	tilted	her	head.	“Really?	Well,	then	I	suppose	something	good	came	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	it	all,	didn’t	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	guess	it	did.	Actually,	I	know	it	did,	especially	for	me.	Marcus	is	amazing, and	I	hope	he’ll	stay	on	here	full-time,	maybe	even	think	about	stepping	in	as	my</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a>assistant	manager	once	my	payroll	numbers	allow	for	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ms.	 Dawson	 looked	 down,	 and	 I	 thought	 I	 saw	 her	 wipe	 a	 tear	 away.	 “I expect	he’d	like	that.	I	know	I	would.	This	place,”	she	gestured	around	the	shop with	an	open	hand,	“is	good.	Real	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 blushed.	 “Thank	 you.	 I	 have	 a	 question	 for	 you,	 too.	 I	 don’t	 know	 if	 you have	room	in	your	schedule	for	this,	but	I	was	wondering	if	I	could	hire	you	to write	a	book	review	for	us	each	week	–	any	book	you	want	as	long	as	I	can	order it	for	the	store.	Just	a	few	paragraphs	about	why	someone	might	want	to	read	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 paused	 and	 tried	 to	 read	 the	 baffled	 expression	 on	 her	 face.	 “What	 do	 you think? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	want	to	hire	me	to	read	books	and	write	about	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	yes.	I	mean	I	can’t	pay	much,	surely	not	what	you’re	worth—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	I’d	love	to.	You	don’t	even	have	to	pay	me.”	She	was	bouncing	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">balls	of	her	feet.	“Maybe	Marcus	and	I	can	write	some	together	sometime?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	love	that	idea,	but	I’m	going	to	pay	you.	We	all	have	to	eat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marcus	strolled	over	and	looked	from	his	mom	to	me.	“What’s	going	on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	 tell	 you	 about	 it	 over	 dinner.	 Tacos	 are	 on	 me.”	 She	 pointed	 out	 the window	toward	Lu’s	truck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 laughed.	 “See	 you	 at	 home	 later,	 Marcus?”	 I	 glanced	 at	 his	 mother	 really quickly,	but	clearly	he	had	told	her	he	was	staying	with	Mart	and	I	because	she didn’t	bat	an	eye.	“Tomorrow,	when	you	come	in,	we’ll	talk	about	your	full-time schedule,	if	that	suits.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	at	me	with	a	wide	smile.	“That	suits,	Ms.	B.	See	you	later.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 they	 passed	 under	 the	 ringing	 bell,	 Mart	 came	 over,	 a	 box	 full	 of	 wine bottles	 under	 her	 arm.	 “That	 was	 kind	 of	 you,	 Harvey.	 I’ll	 run	 the	 numbers tonight	 for	 you,	 see	 what	 kind	 of	 salary	 you	 can	 offer	 your	 new	 assistant manager.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shrugged	and	smiled.	“I	could	use	the	help.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	you	could,	and	you	can’t	help	yourself.	You	love	being	kind	to	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	one	of	the	things	I	love	about	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	started	to	hug	her	but	stopped	short.	“Oh,	Mart,	but	this	doesn’t	mean	I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	going	to	start	paying	rent—“</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a>“Gracious,	 Harvey	 Beckett.	 Of	 course,	 you’re	 going	 to	 pay	 rent.	 I	 would never	doubt	that	for	a	minute.	I	expect	the	last	two	weeks	of	income	have	you	set up	well	for	the	rest	of	the	month.	Budgets,	we’ll	work	on	budgets	for	both	of	us this	week.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gave	her	that	hug	now.	“Okay,	see	you	at	home	in	a	bit?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep,	just	going	to	drop	off	my	trusty	assistant,”	she	gestured	with	her	head</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 the	 young	 woman	 by	 the	 door,	 “and	 return	 these	 last	 bottles	 of	 wine	 to	 the winery	–	we	sold	all	but	five.	BIG	weekend	for	us.	Then,	I’ll	be	back.	Cereal	for dinner?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perfect.	See	you	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	just	finishing	the	register	count	and	putting	together	the	bank	deposit</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	 Cate	 and	 Lucas	 knocked	 on	 the	 glass.	 I	 let	 them	 in	 and	 then	 looked outside.	“You	guys.	You	didn’t	have	to	put	everything	away.	I	was	headed	out	to do	that.	You	did	so	much	already.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cate	 wrapped	 her	 arms	 around	 my	 waist	 and	 squeezed.	 “Harvey,	 do	 you really	think	we	did	more	than	you	did	today?	You	put	together	this	whole	event and,”	 she	 leaned	 over	 to	 whisper,	 “figured	 out	 who	 the	 murderer	 is.	 I	 think	 we can	manage	to	fold	up	some	tables.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 blushed,	 but	 then	 peeked	 out	 the	 window	 again.	 “Wait,	 where	 are	 all	 the books?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lucas	 clapped	 his	 hands	 and	 then	 rubbed	 them	 together.	 “We	 sold	 all	 but about	 two	 dozen,	 and	 Mrs.	 Murphy,	 the	 librarian,	 came	 by	 and	 picked	 up	 the rest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep!	 She	 said	 they’ll	 use	 some	 of	 them	 in	 their	 collection	 and	 the	 rest they’ll	let	the	kids	in	the	summer	program	cut	up	for	art	projects.”	Cate	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	hand	flew	to	my	mouth.	“Oh	no,	Cate,	your	books.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	 you	 kidding	 me?	 Kids	 making	 art	 out	 of	 copies	 of	 art	 –	 that’s	 almost better	than	the	$4,283	we	raised	for	the	scholarship	fund.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	dropped	into	the	arm	chair	next	to	the	Eastern	Shore	history	shelf.	“Whoa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	a	lot	of	money.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep.	Most	of	it	came	from	book	sales,	but	a	few	people	gave	a	little	extra.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lucas	 pulled	 a	 wad	 of	 cash	 out	 of	 his	 pocket	 and	 showed	 it	 to	 me,	 careful	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a>keep	 his	 body	 between	 the	 window	 and	 the	 money.	 “I’ll	 take	 it	 to	 the	 sheriff’s department	in	the	morning,	but	for	now,	I	think	we’re	headed	home	.	.	.	unless you	need	us	to	help	with	anything?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	figuring	out	a	motive,”	Cate	piped	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sighed.	“Oh,	thanks,	guys,	but	honestly,	at	this	point,	I’m	too	tired.	I	really wanted	to	figure	this	out	for	the	sheriff,	save	him	the	work,	but	I’m	at	a	loss.	I’ll just	call	him	in	the	morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cate	 hugged	 me	 again.	 “Sounds	 wise,	 Harvey.	 Sounds	 very	 wise.	 Get	 on home	and	get	some	rest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	locked	the	door	behind	them	and	finished	my	count.	I	had	just	returned	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	chair	by	the	fiction	section	–	a	seat	that	was	quickly	becoming	my	favorite	–</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	I	heard	another	knock	at	the	door.	“I’ll	get	it.	You	rest,”	Daniel	said	to	me as	he	stepped	around	the	shelf	to	look	toward	the	front	of	the	store.	“It’s	Elle.	I’ll take	 the	 dogs	 for	 a	 walk	 while	 you	 two	 talk	 for	 a	 few	 minutes,	 see	 if	 you	 can piece	anything	together.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	 sounds	 good.	 But	 come	 back	 quickly	 will	 you?	 I’m	 tuckered	 and ready	to	go	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	leaned	down	and	kissed	my	cheek	before	heading	to	let	Elle	in.	I	heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	tinkle	of	the	bell	and	the	jingle	of	the	dogs’	tags	as	he	slipped	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elle	looked	more	composed	than	she	had	earlier,	and	I	was	glad	to	see	it.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">stood	up	and	gestured	to	the	comfy	chair,	but	she	pulled	over	the	wingback	from the	history	section	and	plopped	into	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Long	 day,	 huh?”	 I	 asked	 as	 I	 settled	 back	 into	 my	 seat,	 tucking	 my	 feet under	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	long	.	.	.	it	was	great	in	terms	of	business.	I	sold	out	of	everything	except for	a	few	bunches	of	Dusty	Miller	that	no	one	but	a	florist	really	knows	how	to use.”	She	let	out	a	long	sigh.	“But	in	terms	of	Divina,	I	don’t	even	know	what	to do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	let	out	my	own	matching	exhale	and	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	 did	 she	 seem	 with	 your	 explanation	 about	 what	 I	 meant	 about	 her knowing	what	she	did?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 thought	 back	 over	 that	 conversation,	 somehow	 less	 convinced	 than	 I	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a>been	that	I’d	gotten	through	to	her.	I	didn’t	think	it	would	help	Elle	to	know	that though,	so	I	said,	“I	think	she	heard	me,	probably	believed	me,	too.	When	I	left her,	she	sounded	like	she	was	going	to	let	things	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elle	let	her	head	fall	back.	“Okay,	good.	At	least	she	doesn’t	know	we’re	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	her.”	Her	head	snapped	forward.	“But	what	do	we	do	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	tell	the	sheriff.	First	thing	tomorrow,	you	and	I	go	in	and	tell	him	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	know,	and	we	let	him	take	it	from	there.”	I	felt	disappointed,	but	also	relieved with	that	decision.	I	still	wanted	to	spare	him	the	work	–	and	I	really	wanted	to satisfy	 my	 own	 curiosity	 about	 Divina’s	 motive	 –	 but	 none	 of	 that	 justified letting	a	murderer	be	free	any	longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sounds	 like	 a	 good	 plan.”	 She	 stood	 up.	 “I	 forgot	 to	 ask.	 Things	 go	 okay here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stood	alongside	her	and	heard	the	doorbell	ring	as	Daniel	came	back.	“They</p>
<p class="calibre1">did.	We	raised	a	lot	of	money	for	the	scholarship	fund,	and	I	think	the	shop	did really	well,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	started	to	walk	her	to	the	door,	but	as	we	stepped	around	the	local	history</p>
<p class="calibre1">shelf,	we	met	the	muzzle	of	a	shotgun.	Behind	it,	Divina	Stevensmith	was	steady as	an	ocean	breeze.	“I	think	we	have	something	to	discuss,	ladies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tried	to	step	toward	the	front	of	the	store,	but	Divina	swung	her	shotgun	and herded	me	back	before	putting	herself	between	me	and	the	front	door.	Then,	she started	walking	forward	as	Elle	and	I	slowly	stepped	backward,	trying	not	to	trip over	 dog	 beds	 or	 bump	 into	 bookshelves.	 The	 whole	 time	 I	 was	 hoping	 that Divina	 had	 locked	 the	 front	 door	 so	 that	 Daniel	 wouldn’t	 come	 in	 and	 get himself	shot	while	I	also	tried	to	figure	out	how	to	call	for	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	 just	 going	 to	 have	 a	 conversation,	 be	 sure	 we’re	 clear	 on	 some things.”	As	soon	as	we	reached	the	bathroom	doors,	Divina	stopped.	She	pointed the	 gun	 right	 into	 Elle’s	 face	 and	 said,	 “You	 just	 had	 to	 be	 nosy.”	 Then,	 she swung	the	barrel	until	it	grazed	my	nose,	“And	you	just	had	to	be	kind.	If	you’d both	 minded	 your	 own	 business,	 this	 would	 all	 be	 behind	 us.	 Now,	 I	 have	 to sully	Berkeley’s	place	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 brain	 wasn’t	 really	 firing	 correctly,	 but	 I	 did	 manage	 to	 say,	 “Divina,	 I don’t	know	what	you’re	talking	about.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a>She	 moved	 the	 barrel	 down	 and	 shoved	 it	 into	 my	 sternum.	 “Stop	 it.	 Don’t play	 dumb.	 It	 doesn’t	 suit	 you.	 You	 know	 I	 killed	 Lucia	 and	 Deputy	 Williams, God	rest	her	soul.	Poor	woman.	If	she	hadn’t	come	patrolling	that	night	.	.	.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	still	was	having	trouble	forming	complete	thoughts,	but	something	clicked, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 I	 could	 picture	 Divina	 there	 at	 the	 back	 of	 the	 shop	 with	 a	 sage	 smudging stick	as	Deputy	Williams	came	around	the	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	might	have	been	able	to	get	her	to	leave	if	I’d	just	told	her	the	truth,	but	I couldn’t.	And	then	she	started	asking	a	lot	of	questions	.	.	.	about	Lucia	and	the umbrella.	 I	 didn’t	 know	 she	 knew	 about	 the	 umbrella.”	 She	 looked	 like	 she might	 cry	 for	 a	 split	 second,	 but	 then,	 a	 wash	 of	 determination	 came	 over	 her face.	“I	did	what	I	had	to	do.	Berkeley’s	place	had	to	be	cleansed,	and	I	couldn’t let	her	take	me	away	before	I	finished.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elle	grabbed	my	hand,	and	I	tried	to	focus	on	her	touch	so	that	it	would	let</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	brain	work	behind	the	scenes	of	my	fear.	“So	you	were	smudging	the	place</p>
<p class="calibre1">Berkeley	 died?	 The	 place	 those	 hateful	 people	 killed	 him,	 trying	 to	 purify	 his shop.”	I	wasn’t	sure	I	knew	what	I	was	talking	about,	but	I	must	have	been	close because	Divina’s	face	crumpled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	place	was	a	safe	haven.	It	was	pure,	untainted.”	She	took	a	shuddering</p>
<p class="calibre1">breath,	 and	 then	 her	 voice	 was	 cold	 as	 steel,	 “but	 those	 monsters,	 they	 stole Berkeley	and	they	ruined	this	building.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 Divina,	 that’s	 awful.”	 I	 didn’t	 have	 to	 work	 hard	 to	 feign	 sympathy.	 I could	see	her	there	as	a	young	woman,	hiding	in	the	bushes	while	her	husband</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	murdered.	“But	Divina,	why	didn’t	you	seek	justice	then?	Why	not	go	to	the police	with	what	you	knew?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	eyes	locked	on	mine.	“You	think	I	didn’t	try	that.	Of	course	I	tried	that, but	our	marriage	was	illegal	.	.	.	so	no	one	had	to	listen	to	me	as	his	wife.”	Her voice	broke	then.	“Besides,	one	of	the	men	who	killed	Berkeley	.	.	.	“	Her	jaw was	so	tight	I	thought	she	might	break	her	teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	of	them	was	a	police	officer,”	Elle’s	voice	was	very	quiet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Divina	 nodded,	 and	 I	 felt	 a	 tug	 to	 go	 hug	 her.	 The	 shotgun	 shut	 down	 that impulse	though. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 knew	 there	 would	 never	 be	 justice.	 I	 just	 tried	 to	 tamp	 it	 down,	 let	 it	 go</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a>like	people	said	to	do.	And	I	thought	I	had	.	.	.	“</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	willed	myself	to	make	the	connection,	to	figure	out	what	all	this	had	to	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	fact	that	she	had	murdered	her	daughter,	but	I	couldn’t	tie	it	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elle	 got	 it,	 though.	 “Then,	 your	 daughter	 wrote	 those	 horrible	 things	 about Harriet	Tubman,	another	hero	who	provided	safe	haven	for	travelers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elle	 was	 far	 better	 than	 me	 under	 pressure.	 She’d	 put	 it	 together.	 All	 of Divina’s	suppressed	trauma	and	rage	had	come	boiling	out	when	she’d	seen	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">daughter’s	 hateful	 comments	 about	 the	 hero	 who	 had	 helped	 found	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Underground	Railroad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	couldn’t	believe	any	child	of	mine	would	be	so	ignorant.”	She	shook	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">head	violently.	“I	tried	to	talk	to	her,	explain,	tell	her	about	Berkeley,	but	she	was so	arrogant.	She	just	kept	waving	around	those	sheets	of	horrid	orange	paper	that she	 used	 for	 her	 notes,	 telling	 me	 that	 she	 was	 just	 offering	 an	 ‘alternative perspective.’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	slipped	my	hand	around	the	wall,	easing	it	upward	ever	so	slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Before	I	knew	it,	the	umbrella	was	in	my	hand,	and—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	didn’t	mean	to	kill	her,”	Elle	said,	giving	my	hand	a	squeeze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Divina’s	eyes	were	 blazing.	“Of	course,	 I	didn’t.	The	 umbrella	was	heavier</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	I	thought	.	.	.	and	I	was	so	angry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	kept	inching	my	fingers	upward	and	feeling	for	the	alarm	keypad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Before	 I	 could	 help	 her,	 she	 came	 in	 here,	 and	 I	 couldn’t	 force	 myself	 to follow	her.	I	thought	she’d	be	okay,	wake	up	the	next	day	with	a	nasty	headache but	be	okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elle	started	to	step	forward	with	her	right	hand	out,	but	Divina	whipped	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shotgun	up	again.	I	froze,	my	finger	just	at	the	bottom	of	the	keypad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	 though,	 I	 need	 to	 finish	 what	 I	 started.	 Get	 things	 tidied	 up.”	 She looked	 around	 the	 store.	 “You’ve	 done	 a	 good	 job	 here,	 Harvey—	 Wait!	 What are	you	doing?	Don’t	move	a	muscle.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stalked	over	to	me	and	grabbed	my	left	arm.	Then,	she	sighed.	“Into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">storeroom.	Both	of	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wasn’t	willing	to	take	my	eyes	off	Divina,	and	apparently	Elle	had	the	same</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	because	we	inched	our	way	backward	again.	I	stepped	back	through	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a>doorway	 first,	 and	 then	 Elle	 followed	 after	 me.	 Divina	 closed	 the	 door	 behind her	and	then	leaned	back	against	it,	her	breathing	heavy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	desperate.	I	needed	to	keep	her	talking.	“You	know	this	is	where	Lucia</p>
<p class="calibre1">died.	I	know	you	know	that.	And	Deputy	Williams	died	just	behind	here.	You’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	 there	 smudging	 the	 bathroom	 door,	 smudging	 the	 bathroom	 over	 at	 the courthouse	where	you	hid	until	Berkeley’s	murderers	left.	There’s	no	amount	of sage	 that	 is	 going	 to	 undo	 that	 much	 bloodshed	 and	 sorrow,	 Divina.”	 I	 was saying	anything	to	change	her	mind	while	I	hoped	that	Elle	had	an	idea	of	how</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	get	out	of	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Divina	 sighed.	 “I	 know.	 But	 my	 art	 is	 the	 way	 I	 make	 good	 on	 the	 awful things	I’ve	done.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 mean	 by	 donating	 it	 to	 the	 scholarship	 fund	 to	 cover	 up	 your	 guilty conscience?”	Elle	asked.	Apparently,	Elle	and	I	weren’t	on	the	same	wavelength about	how	to	deal	with	the	homicidal	woman.	I	wanted	to	placate	her,	dissuade</p>
<p class="calibre1">her.	Elle	was	apparently	going	for	antagonism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I	didn’t	donate	that	painting	because	I	felt	guilty	–	at	least	not	entirely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nope,	 that	 was	 about	 telling	 the	 story	 of	 that	 night.	 I	 expect	 neither	 of	 you noticed,	but	there’s	a	black	man	chasing	down	two	men	on	horses	with	a	shotgun in	 that	 piece.	 It’s	 subtle,	 almost	 a	 secret,	 just	 like	 Berkeley’s	 murder	 has	 been kept	secret	all	these	years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 tried	 to	 remember	 the	 details	 of	 the	 art	 piece	 from	 when	 I’d	 looked	 at	 it earlier,	 but	 I	 couldn’t	 recall	 anything	 that	 resembled	 a	 person	 chasing	 two	 men on	 horseback.	 It	 had	 looked	 like	 an	 abstract	 collage	 with	 hints	 of	 the	 town buildings	to	me.	But	then,	I	didn’t	know	art.	Maybe	that	story	was	there	.	.	.	or maybe	Divina	was	more	mentally	unwell	than	we	knew	and	just	thought	it	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	art	is	my	work	of	justice.	And	I’m	not	done	yet.	So	I’m	afraid	you	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	to	be.”	She	lowered	the	shotgun	while	she	scanned	the	room.	“I	don’t	want to	ruin	your	inventory.	You’ve	done	such	a	nice	job	of	creating	this	story.	I	know Berkeley	 would	 love	 it,	 and	 that	 display	 at	 the	 front,	 the	 one	 with	  <i class="calibre4">The</i>	  <i class="calibre4">Green</i> <i class="calibre4">Book</i>,	that’s	beautiful.	Now,	we	need	a	place—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	then,	the	door	burst	open,	and	Mayhem	charged	the	petite	woman	just	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	jumped	forward	to	grab	her	gun.	A	shot	went	off,	and	I	spun	around	in	some</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p179"></a><img src="index-179_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">sort	of	 <i class="calibre4">Matrix</i>-inspired	attempt	to	dodge	a	bullet	I	suppose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	spray	of	shot	blasted	into	a	stack	of	books	just	as	Daniel	tackled	Divina</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 I	 wrested	 the	 gun	 from	 her	 hands.	 Mayhem	 stood	 growling	 over	 her,	 and Taco	waddled	over	to	check	on	Elle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	seconds	later,	Sheriff	Mason	ran	into	the	room,	gun	raised,	but	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	saw	that	Daniel	had	Divina	firmly	by	the	wrists,	he	holstered	his	weapon	and put	the	artist	in	handcuffs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elle	 and	 I	 ran	 to	 each	 other	 and	 hugged,	 tears	 streaming	 down	 our	 faces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	 we	 turned	 to	 face	 Divina,	 only	 to	 be	 met	 with	 a	 blank	 stare,	 as	 if	 she couldn’t	even	see	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 the	 sheriff	 escorted	 Divina	 out,	 he	 turned	 to	 us.	 “I’ll	 need	 your statements,	 ladies,	 but	 why	 don’t	 I	 come	 to	 your	 place	 and	 get	 them,	 Harvey? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel,	you	can	get	them	home?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Absolutely.”	 He	 came	 to	 me	 then	 and	 wrapped	 me	 in	 a	 deep	 hug	 before pulling	Elle	to	him,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">WHEN	WE	GOT	to	my	house,	Mart	met	us	at	the	door	with	blankets	and	mugs	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">hot	chocolate	spiked	with	what	I	suspected	was	whiskey.	Daniel	had	apparently</p>
<p class="calibre1">texted	 her	 about	 what	 happened	 as	 we	 walked	 over.	 I	 had	 insisted	 on	 walking, and	Elle	had	agreed.	We	both	needed	the	cool	night	air	to	calm	our	heart	rates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	 installed	 both	 Elle	 and	 me	 on	 the	 sofa,	 and	 Aslan	 came	 to	 settle	 right between	 us.	 Daniel	 called	 Cate	 and	 Lucas	 and	 texted	 Marcus	 and	 Rocky.	 Soon everyone,	 including	 Woody	 Isherwood,	 was	 in	 our	 living	 room	 with	 looks	 of concern	 written	 deep	 on	 their	 faces.	 Not	 a	 single	 one	 of	 our	 friends	 asked	 us about	 what	 had	 happened,	 but	 they	 kept	 checking	 to	 be	 sure	 we	 were	 warm enough,	 asking	 if	 we	 needed	 more	 hot	 cocoa	 –	 or	 straight	 shots	 of	 whiskey	 if Woody	was	doing	the	asking	–	and	getting	us	snacks	every	few	minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	 the	 time	 the	 sheriff	 arrived,	 I	 was	 calmer	 and	 so	 exhausted	 that	 I wondered	if	I	might	drift	off	there	right	in	the	midst	of	everybody.	When	Mason said	 he	 needed	 to	 take	 our	 statements,	 everyone	 but	 Elle	 and	 me	 headed	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p180"></a>kitchen	within	earshot,	but	far	enough	away	to	give	us	space. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 told	 the	 sheriff	 what	 happened,	 what	 had	 led	 us	 to	 believe	 that	 Divina was	the	murderer	and	what	she’d	confessed	to	us.	“You	didn’t	happen	to	record</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	that,	did	you?”	he	said	with	a	wry	grin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alas,	 no,	 I	 was	 a	 little	 more	 worried	 about	 getting	 shot	 than	 I	 was	 about getting	my	phone	out.”	I	tried	to	laugh,	but	the	sound	caught	in	my	throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elle	 smiled.	 “I	 actually	 thought	 about	 it,	 but	 since	 I	 can	 barely	 turn	 on	 the flashlight	on	my	phone,	I	figured	I	couldn’t	be	stealthy	enough	to	actually	record anything.	 With	 my	 luck,	 I’d	 probably	 start	 playing	 Queen’s	 “We	 Are	 The Champions”	instead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 giggled	 at	 the	 image	 of	 Freddy	 Mercury’s	 voice	 filling	 up	 the	 bookshop, and	then	I	started	to	laugh	for	real.	Soon,	I	was	doubled	over	and	breathless	with laughter.	.	.	and	then	I	was	sobbing.	The	sheriff	motioned	for	Daniel	to	come	in, and	I	felt	a	warm	arm	pull	me	close	as	I	let	myself	cry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 I	 caught	 my	 breath,	 Sheriff	 Mason	 said,	 “I	 was	 mostly	 kidding	 about the	recording.	Divina	confessed	to	everything	in	the	car,	told	me	pretty	much	the same	thing	you	did.	Even	mentioned	dropping	the	knife	and	going	back	to	find</p>
<p class="calibre1">it.	That’s	what	she	was	doing	the	night	we	caught	her	back	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	to	Elle.	“You	put	things	together	quickly	–	how	did	you	know	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Tubman	connection?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.	It	just	sort	of	came	together	in	my	head,	and	I	said	it	before	I had	a	chance	to	think.	Looking	back,	it	all	seems	sort	of	obvious.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 always	 does,”	 the	 sheriff	 said.	 “It’s	 too	 bad	 justice	 couldn’t	 have	 been served	 back	 then.	 Maybe	 we	 wouldn’t	 have	 had	 to	 serve	 it	 now.”	 He	 stood	 up and	headed	for	the	door,	and	I	couldn’t	help	but	wondering	how	he	was	doing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	didn’t	seem	the	time	to	ask,	though. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	that’s	it.	Nothing	else,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope,	nothing	else.	Daniel	had	already	given	me	the	heads	up	about	Divina</p>
<p class="calibre1">earlier	today,	so	I	was	planning	on	picking	her	up	for	questioning	tomorrow.	You two	just	saved	me	the	trouble.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gave	Daniel	a	quick	glance.	He	shrugged	and	gave	me	a	sad	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow,	I	didn’t	think	that	our	investigation	was	exactly	making	less	work</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p181"></a>for	the	sheriff,	but	I	was	glad	the	murderer	was	off	the	streets.	Mason	waved	as he	headed	toward	his	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lucas	 and	 Cate	 gave	 me	 a	 hug	 and	 offered	 to	 give	 Elle	 a	 lift	 home,	 and Woody	headed	out	at	the	same	time.	Mart	and	Marcus	offered	to	do	clean-up,	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	and	I	drifted	back	to	the	couch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	couldn’t	wait	until	tomorrow,	huh?”	I	wanted	to	be	angry	with	him,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	just	couldn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	couldn’t.	I	was	too	worried.	And	I	don’t	know	you	well,	but	I	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 well	 enough	 to	 know	 you	 weren’t	 going	 to	 let	 this	 go.”	 His	 face	 fell.	 “I should	have	been	there	tonight,	though.	Harvey,	I’m	so	sorry.	I	thought	you	were safe	with	Elle	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 scooted	 closer	 to	 him,	 folding	 my	 legs	 and	 leaning	 over	 to	 grab	 his shoulders.	“Me,	too.	I	had	really	hoped	Divina	had	bought	my	story	about	Elle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	guess	she	didn’t	.	.	.	we	did	make	it	a	little	too	easy	for	her,	though,	both	of us	being	together.	Two	birds	with	one—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope,	too	soon.	No	killing	metaphors,	please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	and	let	myself	lean	against	him,	and	he	pulled	me	close	and	tucked	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">blanket	around	my	legs. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p182"></a><b class="calibre3">14</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	next	morning,	the	entire	day	before	felt	like	a	dream	–	one	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	gone	from	delightful	to	nightmare.	I	had	mostly	relegated	Divina’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">actions	to	the	past,	vowing	to	not	forget	them	or	to	ignore	them,	but	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	dwell	in	the	darkness	either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	took	a	day	off	from	the	winery	–	a	well-earned	one	since	she’d	signed</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	a	record	number	of	folks	for	their	subscription	offering	during	the	festival	the day	before	–	and	came	in	to	help	me	run	the	shop.	Marcus	was	right	on	time	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">usual,	and	Rocky	came	in	with	a	plate	full	of	muffins.	“Mama	says	muffins	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	recovery,	so	this	is	for	you.”	She	handed	me	a	white	paper	bag	that	was	hand-decorated	with	beautiful	drawings	of	hyacinths.	Inside	was	a	single	muffin	in	a bright	blue	paper	and	a	note,	“You	are	strong,	Harvey	Beckett.	Never	forget	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">–	Love,	Mama	Phoebe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	even	wait	for	the	tears	to	stop	before	I	took	a	bite	right	out	of	the	top of	that	muffin	–	banana	nut	with	more	walnuts	in	it	than	I’d	ever	had	in	a	muffin before.	 I	 could	 taste	 the	 vanilla,	 and	 the	 caramelized	 sugar	 on	 top	 crunched	 on my	 teeth.	 But	 those	 walnuts,	 “Oh	 woman,	 you	 tell	 your	 mama	 that	 she	 knows how	to	help	a	woman	recover.”	Rocky	laughed	and	headed	to	the	shop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 sheriff	 came	 by	 later	 to	 tell	 me	 that	 Divina	 had	 been	 arraigned	 first thing.	She	was	foregoing	a	trial	because,	in	her	words,	“I	want	to	spare	the	town any	more	drama.”	She’d	be	sentenced	later	in	the	week. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	maybe	you	can	stick	to	bookselling	and	leave	the	police	work	to	me,” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p183"></a><img src="index-183_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">he	said	as	he	headed	out	the	door	to	tell	Elle	the	news	about	Divina’s	case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe.”	I	said,	never	one	to	make	promises	I	couldn’t	keep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	came	by	at	lunch	with	tacos	from	Lu’s	truck,	and	we	sat	at	a	table	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	café	with	cups	of	fresh	limeade	that	Rocky	had	decided	to	add	to	her	menu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	drink	tasted	amazing,	but	I	couldn’t	bring	myself	to	eat	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lu	Mason	is	going	to	come	in	here	and	demand	an	explanation	if	you	don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">eat	that	carnitas,	Ms.	Beckett.”	Daniel’s	voice	was	teasing,	but	there	was	concern in	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 looked	 up	 at	 him.	 “It’s	 not	 the	 taco.	 I	 just	 keep	 thinking	 about	 Berkeley Hudson	and	that	night.	He	did	so	much	for	so	many	people,	and	no	one,	even	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	town,	knows	his	story.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	nodded.	“It	is	sad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	NEXT	WEEK	went	by	without	event.	Galen	came	by	on	Thursday	with	Mack, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	most	adorable	senior	bulldog	I’d	ever	seen.	He,	Mayhem,	and	Taco,	who	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">started	 spending	 days	 at	 the	 shop	 since	 he	 was	 a	 bit,	 um,	 under	 foot	 in	 the garage,	became	fast	friends	and	all	shared	one	giant	bed	that	I’d	added	back	by the	self-help	section. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elle	brought	flowers	to	the	shop	every	morning,	and	we	became	fast	friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Near	death	will	do	that	to	you.	Even	Max	Davies	seemed	to	take	a	shine	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shop	 and	 stopped	 by	 from	 time	 to	 time	 to	 offer	 his	 expert	 wisdom	 on	 our cookbook	selection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ms.	 Dawson	 wrote	 her	 first	 column	 for	 our	 weekly	 newsletter	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">recommended	Ta-Nehisi	Coates’	 <i class="calibre4">The	Water	Dancer</i>.	Her	review	was	astute	and honest,	giving	caution	for	our	readers	with	ancestors	who	had	been	enslaved,	but also	 suggesting	 the	 great	 power	 of	 the	 book	 for	 all	 readers.	 We	 got	 several requests	for	the	book	almost	immediately,	and	I	was	delighted	to	send	a	check	by way	of	Marcus	that	first	week. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Business	stayed	brisk,	brisk	enough	that	I	was	able	to	hire	Woody	to	make	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bench	for	in	front	of	the	shop	window	so	that	people	could	relax	outside	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p184"></a><img src="index-184_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">warmer	 weather.	 Cate	 helped	 me	 expand	 the	 art	 book	 section	 and	 managed	 to restrain	 herself	 and	 only	 order	 two	 books	 for	 herself.	 “My	 husband	 will definitely	divorce	me	if	I	start	hoarding	books	again,”	she	said.	Lucas	held	true to	 his	 word	 and	 helped	 me	 develop	 a	 sizable	 maritime	 section	 with	 historical books,	books	on	boats,	and	even	a	nice	collection	of	fiction	with	nautical	themes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marcus	 continued	 to	 prove	 himself	 invaluable,	 and	 I	 was	 on	 track	 to	 bring him	on	as	assistant	manager	by	the	end	of	the	spring.	He	finished	 <i class="calibre4">Possession	</i> in half	the	time	it	had	taken	me	and	declared	it	“good	but	a	little	too	purposefully obtuse,”	 which	 was	 an	 assessment	 I	 could	 not	 argue	 with.	 He	 moved	 into Daniel’s	apartment	within	a	few	weeks	and	loved	it,	and	I	enjoyed	watching	him skate	to	work	every	morning	and	home	every	night	with	a	little	more	lightness	in his	frame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	Daniel,	well,	he	walked	me	home	every	night.	Some	of	those	nights	–</p>
<p class="calibre1">mostly	the	ones	when	Mart	was	out	of	town	–	he	stayed	late,	but	we	still	hadn’t had	our	first	sleepover.	That	would	come,	I	knew,	but	for	now,	we	were	taking	it slow.	The	way	I	liked	it	best. </p>
<p class="calibre1">ONE	DAY	IN	MID-APRIL,	Ralph	Sylvester	stopped	in.	I	hadn’t	seen	him	since	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">day	 of	 the	 street	 fair,	 but	 I’d	 thought	 of	 him	 often,	 wondering	 if	 he’d	 come	 by after	he	heard	about	what	happened	with	Divina.	When	he	showed	up,	I	realized</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 had	 been	 nervous,	 worried	 that	 he	 was	 angry	 with	 me	 for	 having	 his	 friend’s wife	 arrested.	 But	 as	 soon	 as	 I	 saw	 his	 smile,	 I	 knew	 he	 harbored	 no	 such resentment.	He	was	–	unlike	some	of	us	–	a	man	who	worked	through	his	pain</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	came	out	the	other	side	stronger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harvey,	it’s	so	good	to	see	you,”	he	said	as	he	reached	out	a	hand	and	took</p>
<p class="calibre1">mine.	“I’m	sorry	I’ve	been	away	for	so	long.	I	didn’t	want	to	come	back	until	I had	something	for	you.”	From	behind	his	back,	he	pulled	a	square	about	the	size of	 a	 trade	 paperback	 and	 all	 wrapped	 in	 tissue	 paper.	 “I	 hope	 I’m	 not	 being presumptuous	in	giving	it	to	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	furrowed	my	brow	and	then	took	the	package	from	his	hand.	“Well,	thank</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p185"></a><img src="index-185_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">you.”	I	peeled	back	the	paper,	read	the	words,	and	felt	the	tears	begin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	this	location,	Berkeley	Hudson	ran	The	Hudson	Station	from	1928–1958.	This</p>
<p class="calibre1">building	and	Hudson’s	home,	with	his	wife	Divina,	were	safe	havens	for	black</p>
<p class="calibre1">people	from	all	over	the	South.	This	building	is	memorialized	in	 <i class="calibre4">The	Green	Book</i> and	will	forever	be	a	place	of	safety	for	people	who	need	respite	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">rejuvenation,	be	that	through	fuel	or	word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“OH,	MR.	SYLVESTER,	THANK	YOU!”	I	took	a	deep	breath	to	keep	from	sobbing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	what	to	say.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	maybe	you’ll	hang	it	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 looked	 at	 him	 with	 shock.	 “No	 maybe	 about	 it.	 I’m	 hanging	 it	 now.	 Hold on.”	I	spun	around	as	if	a	masonry	drill	was	going	to	fall	from	the	ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	this	will	help.”	Woody	came	through	the	door,	drill	in	hand.	“Ralph</p>
<p class="calibre1">stopped	by	to	ask	if	he	could	borrow	it.”	He	put	out	a	hand	and	took	the	plaque. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I’d	be	honored	if	you’d	let	me	hang	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded,	tears	stealing	my	voice	again.	I	pointed	to	a	spot	at	eye	level	just	to the	right	of	the	front	door.	“I	want	everyone	to	see	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Sylvester	nodded.	“I	like	that	idea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	moments	later,	the	bronze	plaque	hung	where	every	single	person	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">left	this	building	would	notice	it	and	be	reminded.	It	was	the	perfect,	final	touch for	my	store. </p>
<p class="calibre1">FOR	 A	 FEW	 WEEKS,	 I	 continued	 to	 avoid	 the	 storeroom	 –	 too	 many	 hard memories	there.	When	I	absolutely	had	to	go	in,	I’d	rush	to	whatever	I	needed</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	rush	back	out,	ignoring	everything	else.	But	eventually,	I	knew	I	had	to	deal with	 the	 aftermath	 of	 Divina’s	 visit.	 The	 police	 had	 gathered	 all	 the	 evidence</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p186"></a>they	 needed	 weeks	 earlier,	 but	 it	 was	 up	 to	 me	 to	 deal	 with	 the	 damaged inventory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 took	 a	 deep	 breath	 and	 headed	 for	 the	 box	 the	 shotgun	 blast	 had	 blown open.	 Fragments	 of	 paper	 were	 scattered	 all	 around,	 reminding	 me	 of	 Lucia Stevensmith’s	 orange	 notepaper,	 and	 I	 dreaded	 not	 only	 the	 reliving	 of	 the memory	but	the	travail	of	dealing	with	the	damaged	books.	As	I	opened	the	lid, pellets	 tinkled	 out	 on	 the	 ground,	 I	 thought	 I	 might	 cry	 again	 .	 .	 .	 but	 then,	 I caught	 a	 glimpse	 of	 the	 cover	 on	 the	 top	 book.  <i class="calibre4">Riding	 Shotgun</i>	 by	 Rita	 Mae Brown.	How	fitting,	I	thought,	and	started	to	laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p187"></a><b class="calibre3">ENTITLED	TO	KILL</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I f	asked	to	name	my	favorite	season,	I’d	immediately	say	fall.	But	I	also</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 a	 deep	 affection	 for	 the	 first	 really	 warm	 days	 of	 spring,	 the	 ones when	all	the	flowers	are	bursting	forth,	when	tulips	bejewel	front	yards	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	cherry	trees	begin	to	flower	the	air	with	their	petals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	late	April	in	St.	Marin’s,	and	spring	was	fully	here.	My	bookstore	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 open	 an	 entire	 month,	 and	 it	 was	 actually	 turning	 a	 profit.	 A	 small	 profit, but	 a	 profit	 nonetheless.	 I’d	 even	 begun	 paying	 part	 of	 the	 mortgage	 on	 our house.	 Mart,	 my	 best	 friend	 and	 roommate,	 had	 tried	 to	 convince	 me	 to	 wait until	at	least	July	before	I	began	to	contribute,	but	I	had	insisted.	I	wasn’t	paying anywhere	near	half,	but	writing	that	first	check	had	felt	gratifying,	like	I’d	begun to	make	it	as	a	business	owner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 bookstore,	 All	 Booked	 Up,	 had	 been	 my	 dream	 for	 as	 long	 as	 I	 could remember.	Even	as	a	child,	I’d	imagined	myself	surrounded	by	books,	a	dog	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	feet,	reading	all	day.	The	business	end	of	things	came	later,	but	mostly,	I	was living	the	dream,	as	they	say.	Okay,	I	didn’t	do	as	much	reading	as	I	might	like, but	I	did	have	the	“dog	at	my	feet	and	surrounded	by	books”	part	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayhem,	 my	 trusty	 Black	 Mouth	 Cur	 sidekick,	 had	 settled	 right	 in	 as	 the shop	 pup,	 and	 she	 enjoyed	 welcoming	 the	 neighborhood	 canines	 –	 and	 brave felines	–	over	for	a	visit,	too.	I	had	almost	as	many	dog	beds	as	I	did	armchairs in	the	shop,	and	some	days,	every	comfy	seat	–	both	elevated	and	floor-level	–</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	occupied	with	someone	enjoying	a	read	or	a	nap.	And	it	wasn’t	always	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p188"></a>dogs	that	were	napping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	loved	that	people	had	already	begun	to	feel	comfortable	enough	in	the	store</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	just	 come,	 pick	up	 a	 book,	and	 read	 an	 hour	away.	 I	 didn’t	want	 to	 own	 the kind	 of	 store	 where	 people	 felt	 like	 they	 had	 to	 come	 in,	 get	 their	 books,	 and leave.	 When	 someone	 returned	 time	 and	 again	 to	 read	 the	 same	 book,	 I	 found that	endearing.	Not	all	of	us	have	the	funds	to	buy	books,	and	while	I	was	a	huge patron	 of	 the	 local	 library,	 I	 fully	 appreciated	 that	 sometimes	 the	 best	 place	 to read	was	where	noise	was	allowed	and	the	air	smelled	like	coffee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	bookstore’s	little	café	filled	up	what	had	once	been	the	garage	bay	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	 was	 a	 gas	 station.	 It	 was	 small	 and	 quaint,	 and	 it	 served	 the	 best	 latte	 this side	of	Annapolis.	Rocky	was	the	manager	of	that	part	of	the	store,	and	her	share of	the	profits	was	helping	fund	her	BA	down	at	Salisbury	University.	Sometimes her	mom,	Phoebe,	came	in	and	helped	out	for	big	events,	and	that	woman	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">cinnamon	rolls	so	good	they	felt	like	a	Hallmark	movie	Christmas	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	counting	on	the	draw	of	her	rolls	on	this	Saturday	morning	because	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	having	our	first	author	event	that	night,	and	I	needed	to	get	a	buzz	going	in town.	I’d	done	all	the	usual	marketing	–	on-	and	off-line	–	but	my	guest	author was	 local,	 and	 I	 knew	 we	 needed	 the	 small-town	 crowd	 to	 make	 this	 event successful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">David	 Healey	 wrote	 military	 thrillers	 and	 mysteries	 set	 here	 on	 the	 Eastern Shore	of	Maryland,	and	he	had	a	loyal	readership.	I	just	didn’t	know	how	many</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 those	 readers	 lived	 close	 enough	 by	 to	 come	 to	 the	 shop	 for	 his	 evening reading,	but	I	was	hoping	that	the	fact	that	he	was	from	Chesapeake	City	might bring	out	a	banner	crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’d	marketed	David’s	reading	as	part	of	a	“Welcome	to	Spring”	weekend</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 the	 hopes	 that	 people	 would	 spend	 at	 least	 the	 day,	 maybe	 even	 Saturday and	 Sunday,	 in	 St.	 Marin’s.	 The	 hardware	 store	 had	 gotten	 in	 a	 new	 supply	 of kitschy,	crab-themed	T-shirts,	and	the	art	co-op	had	arranged	a	special	exhibition of	local	artists.	I	had	coordinated	the	event	with	the	maritime	museum’s	annual boat-skills	exhibition,	and	Elle	Heron	had	created	a	special	–	“Get	Your	Garden In	Right”	workshop	for	the	afternoon.	We	even	had	a	special	“Eastern	Shore	Prix Fixe”	menu	set	up	at	Chez	Cuisine,	a	few	doors	down.	People	could	come	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p189"></a>enjoy	 the	 events	 of	 the	 day.	 The	 cinnamon	 rolls	 would	 just	 get	 the	 day	 started right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	if	the	guests	didn’t	flock	to	our	doors	in	droves,	I	knew	I	really	needed a	big	warm	concoction	of	flour,	yeast,	cinnamon,	and	cream	cheese	icing.	That</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 Rocky’s	 biggest	 latte	 should	 get	 me	 past	 my	 nerves.	 A	 lot	 of	 people	 were counting	 on	 this	 day	 to	 bolster	 their	 sales	 until	 the	 full-on	 tourist	 season	 of summer	 began	 in	 our	 waterside	 town,	 and	 I	 could	 feel	 the	 weight	 of	 their expectations	as	I	unlocked	the	front	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 bell	 that	 had	 hung	 over	 the	 front	 door	 of	 the	 shop	 since	 it	 was	 a	 gas station	tinkled	as	I	opened	it,	and	I	smiled.	I	would	never	tire	of	that	sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 was	 swinging	 the	 door	 shut	 behind	 me	 when	 I	 felt	 it	 thud	 against something.	I	turned	back	to	see	a	Basset	Hound	head	wedged	between	the	door</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	frame.	“Oh,	Taco.	I’m	so	sorry.”	I	swung	the	door	open.	“I	didn’t	see	you there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Basset	charged	right	ahead,	my	insulting	behavior	forgotten,	as	he	saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mayhem	just	ahead	of	me	on	her	leash.	I	did	my	best	jump	rope	maneuvers	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	quickly	tangling	leashes	and	looked	up	to	see	Taco’s	owner,	Daniel,	smiling at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	felt	a	warm	flush	go	up	my	neck	and	wondered	if	I’d	ever	see	this	man	I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 dating	 and	 not	 have	 my	 face	 turn	 red.	 We’d	 been	 a	 couple	 –	 that’s	 what Mart	said	people	in	town	were	calling	us	–	ever	since	the	shop	opened,	but	I	still got	all	nervous	when	I	first	saw	his	dark	hair,	fair	skin,	and	brown	eyes.	I	found him	so	handsome,	and	he	was	everything	my	ex-husband	hadn’t	been	–	reliable, </p>
<p class="calibre1">attentive,	and	willing	to	take	care	of	me	even	though	he	knew	I	didn’t	need	him to	do	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still,	I	was	forty-four	years	old	and	totally	unclear	on	what	to	call	him.	Was he	my	boyfriend?	Did	middle-aged	women	have	boyfriends?  <i class="calibre4">Lover</i>	just	sounded way	too	racy	for	our	perfectly	slow	relationship,	and	 <i class="calibre4">partner</i>	was	far	too	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Friend</i>	didn’t	work	either	because	that	sounded	like	what	my	grandmother	would have	said,	“Daniel	is	Harvey’s	‘special	friend.’”	I	defaulted	to	“Daniel”	instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	worked	most	of	the	time,	although	a	couple	of	times	I	had	slipped	and	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 Daniel”	 as	 if	 he	 was	 a	 stuffed	 animal	 or	 I	 was	 differentiating	 him	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p190"></a>another	 Daniel,	 like	 that	 guy	 in	 the	 lion’s	 den	 I’d	 learned	 about	 in	 childhood Sunday	School	classes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 liked	 the	 guy,	 though.	 A	 lot,	 even	 if	 I	 didn’t	 know	 what	 to	 call	 him.	 And Mayhem	 felt	 much	 the	 same	 about	 his	 pup,	 Taco.	 I	 didn’t	 really	 buy	 into	 the whole	dog	love	affairs	craze	myself,	but	these	two	were	at	the	least	best	pals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Already,	 they’d	 sniffed	 out	 the	 best	 bed	 for	 the	 day	 –	 the	 one	 in	 the	 front window’s	sunbeam	beside	the	display	of	books	on	shipwrecks	–	and	were	lying</p>
<p class="calibre1">butt	to	butt	and	snoring.	The	dog’s	life	was	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Daniel	and	I	made	our	way	to	the	front	counter,	he	gave	me	a	quick	kiss</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 cheek.	 “So	 aside	 from	 trying	 to	 decapitate	 my	 dog,	 how	 has	 your	 day been	so	far?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 I	 have	 to	 say	 it	 just	 got	 a	 whole	 lot	 better.”	 I	 had	 never	 been	 a flirtatious	person	before,	but	this	man,	for	some	reason	he	brought	it	out	in	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	blush	flew	into	his	cheeks,	too,	and	we	stood	grinning	at	one	another	until</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	sound	of	a	throat	clearing	broke	our	gaze.	Rocky	was	standing	in	front	of	the counter	 across	 from	 us	 with	 a	 grin	 a	 mile	 wide	 on	 her	 face.	 “Sorry.	 I	 thought you’d	heard	me	come	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	looked	toward	the	front	door.	I	 <i class="calibre4">hadn’t</i>	heard	the	bell	ring.	“No,	I’m	sorry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	are	you?	How’s	studying	for	finals	going?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 let	 out	 a	 long,	 slow	 sigh.	 “It’s	 going.”	 She	 pulled	 her	 thick	 handful	 of tiny	braids	into	a	hair	tie	and	then	dropped	a	heavy	tote	bag	onto	the	counter.	“I mean,	I	love	my	classes,	but	I	had	a	very	high	opinion	of	my	reading	speed	and retention	 ability	 when	 I	 signed	 up	 for	 three	 English	 and	 two	 history	 classes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finals	are	in	two	weeks,	and	I	have	five	books	to	read	and	three	papers	to	write to	even	get	to	the	finals.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whew,	that’s	a	lot.	What	are	your	professors	thinking?”	I	remembered	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">college	 days	 when	 I	 was	 an	 English	 and	 History	 double	 major	 just	 like	 Rocky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	semester,	I’d	had	to	buy	sixty-seven	books.	Sixty-seven.	I	loved	books,	but that	was	ridiculous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	 thinking	 that	 their	 class	 is	 the	 most	 important	 one.	 They’ve	 all forgotten	what	it’s	like	to	have	five	classes	and	a	job.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	laughed.	“That,	right	there,	ladies,	is	why	I	didn’t	finish	college.	Too</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p191"></a>much	reading.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	never	in	my	life	thought	I’d	date	a	man	who	didn’t	read,	but	here	I	was,	full on	in	the	throes	of	like	–	I	wasn’t	ready	for	the	other	L	word	yet	–	with	a	man who	took	it	as	a	point	of	pride	that	the	last	full	book	he	read	was	the	copy	of	 <i class="calibre4">Tom</i> <i class="calibre4">and	 Jerry	 Meet	 Little	 Quack</i>	 that	 his	 mom	 found	 in	 a	 box	 of	 his	 first-grade mementos. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	wasn’t	that	 Daniel	didn’t	appreciate	 knowledge	or	books,	 and	it	 certainly wasn’t	that	he	wasn’t	smart	–	the	man	could	disassemble	and	then	reassemble	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">car	 engine	 in	 less	 than	 two	 hours,	 a	 feat	 I	 understood	 to	 be	 impressive,	 even though	my	knowledge	of	cars	stopped	at	the	fact	that	Brits	called	the	trunk	of	the car	 the	 “boot.”	 No,	 Daniel	 was	 plenty	 smart.	 He	 just	 couldn’t	 sit	 still	 long enough	 to	 read.	 His	 body	 needed	 to	 be	 moving.	 Even	 when	 we	 watched	 TV	 –</p>
<p class="calibre1">lately,	we’d	been	binge-watching	a	show	I’d	loved	a	few	years	back,  <i class="calibre4">The	4400	–</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 put	 together	 model	 cars.	 He	 just	 couldn’t	 be	 completely	 still,	 and	 school required	a	lot	of	stillness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 didn’t	 mind	 the	 car-building	 stuff,	 though,	 because	 he’d	 inspired	 me	 to make	use	of	my	downtime,	too.	I’d	picked	back	up	my	cross-stitch	hobby	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">years	of	neglect.	And	like	most	things	in	my	life,	I	didn’t	start	slow.	I	bought	a kit	 of	 a	 cat	 in	 a	 bookshop.	 It	 was	 beautiful	 –	 all	 bright	 colors	 and	 a	 black	 and white	cat	with	a	few	extra	pounds	that	reminded	me	of	my	own	girl,	Aslan.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	was	also	immense	–	maybe	18	x	24	on	small-count	fabric	–	and	every	square</p>
<p class="calibre1">called	 for	 a	 stitch.	 At	 this	 rate,	 I’d	 finish	 it	 when	 I	 was	 seventy.	 Still,	 it	 was relaxing	because	it	required	my	attention	and	let	my	mind	slow	down.	It	was	the only	way	I’d	found,	so	far,	to	stop	thinking	about	the	shop.	Well,	cross-stitch	and kissing	Daniel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rocky	hefted	her	heavy	bag	onto	her	shoulder	and	headed	to	the	café	while</p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	 carried	 the	 platter	 of	 her	 mom’s	 cinnamon	 rolls	 behind	 her.	 I’d	 slipped one	 out	 from	 under	 the	 plastic	 and	 sat	 savoring	 the	 doughy	 goodness	 while	 I checked	emails. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	 seemed	 to	 be	 in	 order	 for	 the	 day.	 David	 Healey	 had	 written	 to say	he’d	be	in	town	by	noon	and	wondered	if	I	could	grab	lunch	to	talk	about	the night’s	event.	I	shot	back	a	quick	response	with	my	cell	number	and	told	him	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p192"></a>text	 me	 when	 he	 arrived.	 Then,	 I	 answered	 enough	 queries	 about	 parking	 and general	activities	in	town	that	by	the	time	we	opened	at	ten,	I	felt	confident	we were	going	to	have	a	great	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">ABOUT	 TEN	 THIRTY,	 Mart	 arrived	 with	 Cate,	 our	 friend	 who	 ran	 the	 art	 coop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’d	 been	 out	 on	 the	 bay	 kayaking,	 trying	 to	 capture	 photos	 of	 some watermen	 at	 work	 for	 Cate’s	 new	 portrait	 series.	 Mart	 was	 on	 hand	 to	 run	 the register	in	case	things	got	busy,	and	Cate	was	going	to	lead	a	plein	air	painting group	 that	 was	 meeting	 here	 at	 eleven.	 Both	 of	 them	 were	 rosy	 cheeked	 and equally	pleasant	tempered.	Part	of	me	wished	I’d	been	able	to	go,	but	most	of	me was	 quite	 content	 to	 have	 spent	 the	 morning	 answering	 questions	 about	 books, making	 notes	 about	 titles	 we	 needed	 to	 order	 back	 in,	 and	 enjoying	 Phoebe’s cinnamon	roll.	Sure,	I	missed	out	on	some	things	by	running	the	shop,	but	what	I got	to	do,	well,	it	more	than	made	up	for	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks	like	you’ve	got	things	well	in	hand,”	Mart	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	 let’s	 not	 be	 too	 hasty,	 Martha.”	 Cate	 put	 on	 a	 serious	 face	 as	 she brushed	her	short	black	hair	out	of	her	eyes.	“The	true	test	is	whether	she—“</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	reached	below	the	counter	and	pulled	out	two	saucers,	each	adorned	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cinnamon	roll. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cate	laughed.	“Yep,	all	in	hand	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I’d	met	Cate	a	few	weeks	ago,	I	hadn’t	realized	that	Mart	and	I	really</p>
<p class="calibre1">needed	 a	 third	 to	 make	 our	 friendship	 even	 more	 amazing,	 but	 it	 turns	 out	 that the	 third	 we	 were	 missing	 was	 a	 short,	 Korean-American	 photographer	 whose husband	cooked	really,	really	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mart	 and	 I	 had	 been	 friends	 for	 years	 back	 in	 San	 Francisco,	 and	 when	 I’d decided	to	return	home	to	Maryland	last	fall,	she’d	decided	to	come	along.	She, by	 far,	 looked	 the	 youngest	 of	 all	 of	 us	 with	 her	 fair	 skin	 that	 showed	 nary	 a wrinkle	 and	 her	 thick,	 brown	 hair	 that	 she	 wore	 in	 soft	 waves	 or	 in	 a	 ponytail that,	somehow,	managed	to	look	amazing.	My	curly,	quickly-graying	short	hair</p>
<p class="calibre1">did	not	always	fare	so	well	in	the	wind	and	moisture	of	a	waterside	town,	and	I took	to	rolled	bandanas	on	days	when	I	didn’t	want	to	look	like	Lyle	Lovett	or	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p193"></a>spend	an	hour	with	a	flat	iron.	(I	never	wanted	to	spend	an	hour	with	a	flat-iron.) Also,	 I	 had	 wrinkles	 in	 my	 pale,	 pinkish	 skin,	 including	 a	 furrow	 between	 my eyes	that	would	never	smooth	out	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many	 women	 never	 get	 to	 have	 one	 good	 friend	 in	 the	 world,	 and	 I	 was lucky	 enough	 to	 have	 two.	 In	 both	 literal	 and	 figurative	 ways,	 they	 had	 each saved	my	life,	and	I	was	so	glad	we	got	to	see	each	other	every	day,	even	if	they teased	 me	 no	 end	 about	 having	 a	 boyfriend.	 They	 always	 insisted	 on	 saying	 it <i class="calibre4">boooyyyfriend</i>,	like	we	were	eleven.	Still,	I	adored	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 friends	 tucked	 into	 their	 cinnamon	 rolls	 with	 all	 the	 genteelness	 of vultures	on	roadkill,	and	I	couldn’t	help	but	smile.	No	pinkies	in	the	air	here.	I’m pretty	sure	I	even	caught	Mart	licking	the	plate	when	I	turned	around	to	get	more bags	to	put	under	the	counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Snacks	done	and	coffee	procured	from	Rocky,	they	got	to	work,	and	I	began</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 usual	 circuit	 around	 the	 store,	 just	 to	 be	 sure	 things	 were	 tidy,	 but	 not pristine.	 Something	 about	 a	 little	 bit	 of	 disheveled	 order	 felt	 home-like, comfortable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	just	rounding	the	corner	of	the	religion	section	when	I	spied	a	familiar pair	of	Jordans	propped	on	a	shelf	next	to	a	wing-back	chair.	I	slipped	behind	the seat	and	peeked	over	the	top	to	get	a	look	at	the	title	of	the	book	the	person	was reading.	“<i class="calibre4">The	Water	Dancer</i>.	I	hear	that’s	really	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marcus	 Dawson	 slowly	 lowered	 his	 book,	 pulled	 his	 brown	 legs	 down	 as	 I stepped	 around	 in	 front	 of	 him,	 and	 smiled	 up	 at	 me.	 “It’s	 amazing,”	 he	 said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“but	no	spoilers.	You	have	to	read	it	yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will	do.”	I	kicked	his	shin	playfully.	“You	know,	you	don’t	have	to	be	here</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	you’re	not	working.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shrugs.	“What	can	I	say?	When	you	find	a	good	thing	.	.	.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marcus	had	started	working	here	almost	a	month	ago,	and	he	was	amazing	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	job	–	thoughtful	with	his	recommendations	and	voracious	in	his	reading.	At first,	I’d	hired	him	to	help	him	out,	but	it	turned	out	that	he	was	a	major	draw	for returning	 customers	 who	 found	 his	 book	 suggestions	 to	 be	 so	 fitting	 for	 them that	they	came	in	just	to	talk	to	him	about	the	previous	recommendation	and	pick up	a	new	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p194"></a>Now,	he	had	a	regular	column	in	our	weekly	newsletter,	where	he	did	book matchmaking	 with	 customers	 who	 filled	 out	 a	 short	 survey	 as	 they	 stopped	 by. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	gotten	the	idea	from	one	of	my	favorite	podcasts,  <i class="calibre4">What	Should	I	Read	Next? </i>, and	 people	 were	 loving	 it.	 Our	 box	 of	 completed	 surveys	 was	 so	 full	 that	 we were	 talking	 about	 doing	 Instagram	 videos	 to	 accommodate	 more	 customer requests.	I	had	definitely	gotten	the	better	end	of	the	deal	when	I’d	hired	Marcus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 Monday,	 he	 would	 begin	 his	 first	 shift	 as	 assistant	 manager.	 I	 noticed he’d	had	his	hair	cut	into	a	shorter	version	of	his	typical	box	fade	and	wondered again	 if	 all	 the	 things	 from	 my	 teenage	 years	 were	 coming	 back:	 high-waisted jeans,	fanny	packs,	and	shoulder	pads.	It	made	me	shiver.	Marcus’s	hair	though, I	loved.	I	couldn’t	help	but	think	of	Kid	’n	Play	when	I	saw	him,	but	I	wouldn’t make	the	mistake	of	mentioning	them	again	since	Marcus	had	looked	at	me	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	approximately	eight	hundred	years	old	the	one	time	I’d	brought	them	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	 given	 him	 the	 weekend	 off	 so	 that	 he	 could	 relax,	 spend	 time	 with	 his mom,	and	maybe	even	do	something	fun	in	Annapolis	or	Baltimore,	but	I	wasn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	that	surprised	to	see	him	in	the	store.	He	really	did	seem	to	love	St.	Marin’s and	my	bookshop,	and	I	knew	that	living	in	his	apartment	above	Daniel’s	garage was	probably	kind	of	lonely,	especially	when	Daniel	wasn’t	at	work.	Plus,	I	just liked	him	and	liked	having	him	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	happy	reading.	But	no	working	today.	Not	even	Insta	photos.	It’s	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">day	off.	I	don’t	want	to	pay	you,	but	I’ll	be	forced	to	if	you	work,	you	hear	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gave	his	leg	another	nudge	and	headed	off	to	help	Daniel,	who	was	bringing	up two	boxes	of	books	for	the	new	window	display. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Max	Davies,	the	owner	of	Chez	Cuisine,	had	taken	a	while	to	grow	on	me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	it	turned	out	that	he	had	great	taste	in	cookbooks.	I’d	promised	him	we’d	do a	new	display	with	some	titles	he’d	recommended.	It	had	taken	a	bit	of	coaxing for	me	to	convince	him	that	we	needed	not	only	true	cookbooks	but	also	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	titles	–	like	Ruth	Reichl’s	 <i class="calibre4">Save	Me	The	Plums</i>	–	to	round	out	the	display. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 his	 list	 of	 recommendations	 turned	 out	 to	 be	 stellar	 and	 diverse,	 and	 I	 was eager	to	get	the	books	into	the	window	for	the	afternoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daniel	hefted	the	boxes	onto	the	display	platform	and	gave	me	a	quick	hug</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	heading	over	to	his	garage.	For	the	past	couple	of	weeks,	he’d	spent	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p195"></a>first	 couple	 of	 hours	 of	 Saturday	 morning	 here	 at	 the	 shop	 helping	 me	 with displays	 and	 shelving.	 He	 wasn’t	 much	 of	 a	 reader,	 but	 he	 was	  <i class="calibre4">all	 in</i>	 for supporting	the	shop.	Today,	though,	he	had	car	repairs	to	manage,	so	I	focused on	my	display	and	looked	forward	to	seeing	him	later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 had	 just	 put	 the	 final	 book	 –	  <i class="calibre4">Eat	 This	 Poem</i>	 by	 Nicole	 Gulotta	 –	 into	 the display	when	David	pulled	up.	Mart	and	I	helped	him	unload	his	car,	and	then	he and	I	headed	out	for	lunch	at	the	new	BBQ	place	that	had	just	opened	up	at	the end	of	Main	Street.	I	was	a	sucker	for	a	place	with	a	cute	name,	so	Piggle	and Shake	had	won	me	over	as	soon	as	the	sign	went	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 author	 and	 I	 had	 a	 lovely	 lunch,	 and	 I	 was	 thrilled	 to	 hear	 that	 he	 had more	 books	 coming	 in	 his	 renovation	 series.	 I	 knew	 his	 military	 thrillers	 were good,	too,	but	I	was	much	more	a	mystery	girl	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	our	meal,	I	pointed	him	in	the	direction	of	the	co-op	and	gave	him	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">address	 for	 the	 maritime	 museum	 before	 heading	 back	 to	 the	 shop	 for	 the afternoon.	 St.	 Marin’s	 wasn’t	 San	 Francisco	 in	 terms	 of	 entertainment,	 but	 in some	ways,	it	was	even	better.	At	least	here,	everything	was	within	easy	walking distance	 of	 everything	 else.	 Plus,	 since	 I	 knew	 Cate	 would	 take	 good	 care	 of David	 at	 the	 co-op	 and	 then	 Lucas	 would	 do	 the	 same	 at	 the	 museum,	 I	 didn’t worry	 that	 he	 might	 get	 bored	 or	 frustrated.	 They’d	 agreed	 to	 give	 him	 the behind-the-scenes	tour	and	have	him	back	to	the	shop	by	five	so	we	could	all	get dinner	before	the	reading. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 my	 way	 back,	 I	 needed	 to	 stop	 by	 Elle	 Heron’s	 farm	 stand	 to	 pick	 up some	 fresh	 flowers	 for	 the	 café	 tables	 and	 a	 bouquet	 for	 the	 signing	 table,	 too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elle,	a	white	woman	in	her	sixties	with	light-brown	hair	cut	into	a	bob,	had	been supplying	fresh	flowers	–	all	grown	at	her	small	farm	outside	of	town	–	since	we opened,	 and	 this	 time,	 she	 was	 giving	 us	 some	 of	 the	 most	 amazing	 tulips	 I’d ever	seen.	The	bright	reds	and	yellows	and	purples	would	add	just	the	right	color to	 the	 store,	 and	 I	 couldn’t	 wait	 to	 see	 what	 she’d	 put	 together	 for	 the	 main arrangement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shed	my	sweater	as	I	walked	the	two	blocks	up	to	her	shop	–	No	Label;	Just</p>
<p class="calibre1">Farm	to	Table	–	and	took	a	swig	from	my	water	bottle	before	I	walked	in.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">day	had	grown	quite	warm,	and	I	had	broken	my	first	sweat	of	the	year,	which</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p196"></a>was	 cause	 for	 a	 small	 celebration	 that	 I’d	 begun	 a	 decade	 ago	 in	 my	 first</p>
<p class="calibre1">“summer”	on	the	west	side	of	San	Francisco.	There,	the	warm	days	come	in	mid-</p>
<p class="calibre1">fall,	when	the	fog	burns	off	completely	and	the	temperature	climbs	into	the	high seventies,	 maybe	 even	 low	 eighties.	 On	 each	 of	 those	 days,	 I	 walked	 to	 the corner	 market	 and	 got	 an	 ice	 cream	 from	 the	 chest	 freezer	 by	 the	 front	 door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Always	the	same	thing	every	day	until	the	fog	returned.	Sadly,	“summer”	in	San Francisco	rarely	lasted	more	than	two	weeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,	I	was	going	to	keep	up	that	tradition	with	a	slight	modification.	After</p>
<p class="calibre1">all,	 I	 couldn’t	 eat	 ice	 cream	 every	 day	 it	 got	 to	 eighty	 here.	 I	 wouldn’t	 have minded	 eating	 ice	 cream	 every	 day	 from	 April	 to	 September,	 but	 I	 figured	 my cholesterol	 might	 mind.	 So	 just	 the	 first	 day,	 I	 decided.	 A	 celebration	 of	 the warmth	returning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey	Elle.”	I	shouted	as	I	walked	toward	the	cooler,	hopeful	that	she	was	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">down-to-earth	 in	 her	 ice	 cream	 selection	 as	 she	 was	 about	 everything	 else.	 I wanted	 my	 plain,	 classic	 ice	 cream	 sandwich	 something	 fierce,	 and	 I	 was	 not disappointed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 slid	 open	 the	 top	 of	 the	 freezer,	 and	 as	 I	 leaned	 down	 and	 grabbed	 my sandwich,	something	caught	my	eye.	I	stood	up	and	took	a	step	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	 I	 dropped	 my	 ice	 cream	 on	 the	 floor	 as	 I	 backed	 into	 a	 shelf	 of broccoli	and	cabbage	seedlings	and	sent	potting	soil	and	tiny	plants	flying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beside	the	cooler	lay	the	body	of	Huckabee	Harris,	his	muck	boots	covered</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 mud	 and	 his	 face	 as	 white	 as	 the	 vanilla	 ice	 cream	 now	 leaking	 out	 of	 the wrapper	at	my	feet. </p>

When	she’s	not	writing,	she	enjoys	chasing	her	son around	the	house	with	the	full	awareness	she	will	never	catch	him,	cross-stitching	while	she	binge-watches police	procedurals,	and	reading	everything	she	can	get	her	hands	on.
