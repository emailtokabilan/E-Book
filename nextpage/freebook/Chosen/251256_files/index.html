<p class="calibre1">ONE</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 Dying	 began	 on	 my	 twenty-fourth	 birthday.	 Even	 now	 I	 truly	 believe	 that was	nothing	more	than	a	sad	coincidence,	but	if	nothing	else,	the	synchronicity</p>
<p class="calibre1">helps	me	to	remember	when	the	end	began.	September	twenty-sixth.	There	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">certain	crispness	in	the	air,	a	bite	after	the	sun	went	down	that	told	me	fall	was on	the	way,	and	winter	soon	to	follow.	We	didn’t	get	as	cold	in	Albuquerque	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	did	in	Santa	Fe,	but	we	could	feel	the	shift	in	the	seasons	even	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	out	with	friends	doing	tequila	shots	at	Zacatecas	when	the	first	reports</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	 a	 strange	 illness	 in	 New	 York	 showed	 up	 on	 the	 evening	 news.	 Maybe	 I caught	a	glimpse	on	the	TV	in	the	bar,	but	I	don’t	think	so.	To	be	blunt,	I	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">pretty	 wasted.	 Getting	 plowed	 like	 that	 wasn’t	 in	 my	 usual	 repertoire,	 but	 my friend	 Tori	 kept	 ordering	 round	 and	 after	 round,	 and	 since	 I	 wasn’t	 driving,	 I didn’t	try	too	hard	to	stop	her.	Maybe	in	the	back	of	my	mind	I	was	thinking	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	 year	 I	 was	 twenty-four,	 and	 twenty-five	 would	 come	 sliding	 along	 soon enough,	 and	 I	 might	 as	 well	 party	 with	 abandon	 while	 I	 still	 could.	 Sooner	 or later	I’d	have	to	be	a	good,	responsible	adult,	but	not	on	my	birthday. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 next	 day	 was	 a	 Saturday.	 No	 school	 or	 work	 for	 me;	 I	 was	 getting	 my master’s	in	English,	mostly	because	I	couldn’t	really	figure	out	what	else	to	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 myself,	 and	 staying	 in	 college	 for	 as	 long	 as	 possible	 seemed	 pretty attractive	compared	to	what	awaited	me	in	the	real	world.	Since	I’d	been	lucky</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough	to	snag	a	T.A.	position	teaching	lower-division	English	classes,	I	didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>have	 to	 worry	 about	 dragging	 my	 sorry	 hung-over	 ass	 into	 work,	 either.	 I	 had until	Monday	to	recover. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Around	 noon	 I	 finally	 wandered	 into	 the	 kitchen,	 after	 taking	 a	 shower	 so long	the	hot	water	began	to	run	out.	Good	thing	we	had	a	separate	water	heater</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	the	little	apartment	over	the	garage	where	I	lived,	or	I	probably	would	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard	 about	 it	 from	 my	 mother.	 All	 right,	 so	 I	 was	 still	 living	 at	 home,	 but	 the apartment	gave	me	at	least	the	illusion	of	independence,	if	not	the	real	thing.	It also	 allowed	 me	 to	 pay	 much	 lower	 rent	 than	 I	 would	 have	 otherwise.	 My parents	 didn’t	 want	 to	 charge	 me	 anything	 —	 well,	 not	 my	 mother,	 anyway	 —</p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 I’d	 insisted.	 It	 was	 a	 pittance,	 but	 it	 did	 cover	 the	 utilities	 and	 helped	 give them	some	extra	wiggle	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	mother	had	the	little	white	TV	on	the	kitchen	counter	turned	on	and	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">frowning	as	she	watched	some	cable	news	talking	head	go	on	about	a	new	illness</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	had	begun	appearing	in	New	York	and	Los	Angeles	the	day	before.	Reports</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	also	coming	in	from	up	and	down	both	coasts	about	this	unnamed	disease, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which	left	its	victims	hospitalized	with	extremely	high	fevers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“More	 Ebola?”	 I	 asked,	 blinking	 against	 the	 too-bright	 light	 in	 the	 kitchen and	making	a	beeline	for	the	fridge,	where	my	mother	always	kept	a	pitcher	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">iced	tea,	even	in	the	dead	of	winter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	Jessica,”	she	said,	that	little	pucker	of	worry	still	showing	between	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">brows.	“Something	else.	They	don’t	know	what	it	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mmm.”	 In	 that	 moment,	 I	 was	 far	 more	 concerned	 with	 getting	 some</p>
<p class="calibre1">caffeine	 into	 my	 bloodstream	 ASAP	 than	 worrying	 about	 the	 disease	  <i class="calibre3">du	 jour</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those	sorts	of	things	never	seemed	to	affect	us	here	in	Albuquerque.	I	wouldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">say	we	were	exactly	the	city	that	America	forgot,	but	if	it	weren’t	for	 <i class="calibre3">Breaking</i> <i class="calibre3">Bad</i>,	I	doubted	most	people	would	have	spared	my	hometown	a	second	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	 the	 side-eye	 my	 mother	 was	 giving	 me	 as	 I	 downed	 the	 iced	 tea,	 I guessed	that	the	makeup	I’d	carefully	applied	earlier	wasn’t	doing	much	to	hide</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	evidence	that	I’d	had,	as	they	say,	a	gaudy	night.	But	because	I	hadn’t	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">driving	and	was	more	or	less	ambulatory	this	morning,	she	seemed	to	be	giving</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	a	pass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dad	have	a	shift	today?”	I	inquired,	after	refilling	my	glass	of	iced	tea	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">taking	 a	 few	 more	 gulps.	 Since	 I	 felt	 fortified	 enough	 to	 eat	 at	 that	 point,	 I popped	 the	 pitcher	 of	 tea	 back	 into	 the	 fridge	 and	 got	 a	 package	 of	 English muffins	out	of	the	breadbox. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.”	She	didn’t	exactly	sigh,	but	I	could	tell	she	wasn’t	thrilled,	either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 father	 was	 an	 officer	 with	 the	 Albuquerque	 police	 department.	 Still	 a beat	cop	after	twenty-five	years,	too.	He	never	had	any	interest	in	riding	a	desk, liked	 to	 be	 out	 on	 the	 streets.	 How	 my	 mother	 lived	 with	 it,	 day	 after	 day,	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>didn’t	 know.	 My	 brother	 and	 I	 generally	 took	 our	 father’s	 occupation	 in	 stride, since	 it	 had	 always	 been	 a	 part	 of	 our	 lives.	 But	 I	 knew	 my	 father	 had	 gone through	the	academy	after	he	and	my	mother	got	married,	and	so	it	hadn’t	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	irretrievable	fact	of	life	when	they	were	starting	out	as	a	couple.	I	know	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">wished	 he	 was	 more	 interested	 in	 becoming	 a	 detective	 so	 he	 wouldn’t	 be	 so much	in	harm’s	way	every	day.	That	wasn’t	my	father,	though	—	even	at	fifty-two,	he	was	lean	and	fit,	and	could	probably	put	guys	half	his	age	through	a	wall</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	necessary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 the	 time,	 the	 department	 was	 chronically	 short-handed,	 so	 my	 father</p>
<p class="calibre1">picked	 up	 a	 lot	 of	 extra	 shifts.	 My	 mother	 never	 protested,	 since	 she	 knew	 he was	 doing	 it	 for	 us,	 putting	 more	 money	 in	 the	 bank,	 but	 she	 couldn’t	 help worrying.	 Sometimes	 I	 wondered	 if	 my	 father	 knew	 exactly	 how	 stressed	 she was	 every	 time	 he	 left	 for	 work.	 I	 didn’t	 think	 that	 would’ve	 stopped	 him, though,	because	as	much	as	he	loved	her,	he	also	loved	his	job	and	thought	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	doing	some	genuine	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	at	least	it’s	a	daytime	shift,”	I	told	her,	then	put	the	two	halves	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">English	muffin	I’d	just	broken	apart	into	the	toaster	oven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 know.”	 The	 worry	 line	 was	 still	 there,	 and	 it	 seemed	 to	 deepen	 as	 she returned	 her	 attention	 to	 the	 TV.	 The	 talking	 heads	 had	 been	 replaced	 by	 a doctor,	a	woman	in	her	late	forties	who	probably	would	have	been	pretty	if	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">hadn’t	look	so	tired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	illness	manifests	as	a	very	high	fever,	spiking	as	high	as	106	degrees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’re	 having	 difficulty	 controlling	 the	 fever,	 even	 with	 analgesics	 and	 ice packs.”	She	paused,	 pushing	a	strand	 of	dishwater-blonde	hair	 back	behind	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">ear.	Obviously,	she	hadn’t	bothered	to	primp	before	going	to	make	her	statement</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	front	of	the	cameras.	“No	other	symptoms	have	been	observed	at	this	point.	If</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	or	someone	in	your	family	comes	down	with	a	fever	above	103,	please	call</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	doctor	or	go	to	the	local	emergency	room.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 camera	 cut	 to	 the	 reporter	 interviewing	 the	 doctor.	 “Dr.	 Leviton,	 any word	 on	 where	 this	 illness	 has	 come	 from?	 Is	 it	 connected	 to	 the	 doctors returning	from	West	Africa?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	 Dr.	 Leviton	 replied	 at	 once,	 looking	 almost	 annoyed.	 “None	 of	 the victims	brought	in	to	Mount	Sinai	or	any	of	the	other	hospitals	in	the	city	appear to	 have	 any	 connection.	 Most	 of	 them	 haven’t	 even	 left	 New	 York	 during	 the past	 few	 months.	 Of	 those	 who	 have	 traveled,	 they’ve	 returned	 home	 from destinations	as	diverse	as	Tahiti,	Paris,	and	Australia.	Again,	there	doesn’t	seem to	be	any	connection.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 that	 moment,	 a	 nurse	 came	 up	 and	 whispered	 in	 the	 doctor’s	 ear.	 Her expression	 shifted	 from	 annoyance	 to	 outright	 worry	 before	 she	 said	 quickly, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>“I’m	sorry	—	a	patient	needs	me.	That’s	all	I	can	tell	you	right	now.”	And	she turned	away	from	the	cameras	and	began	hurrying	down	the	hallway	almost	at	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">run,	the	nurse	right	behind	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	camera	panned	back	to	the	reporter,	who	was	wearing	what	he	probably</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	 was	 a	 look	 of	 measured	 concern…but	 to	 me,	 he	 just	 looked	 scared.	 I wonder	what	the	nurse	had	said	to	the	doctor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever	 it	 had	 been,	 the	 reporter	 didn’t	 mention	 it.	 He	 only	 said,	 “That’s the	 latest	 from	 Mount	 Sinai	 Hospital	 in	 New	 York	 City.	 Again,	 as	 Dr.	 Leviton stated,	seek	medical	assistance	immediately	if	you	have	a	fever	in	excess	of	—	” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	mother	turned	off	the	TV.	I	arched	an	eyebrow	at	her,	and	she	shook	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">head.	 “It’s	 always	 something,”	 she	 said.	 “I	 shouldn’t	 even	 have	 turned	 it	 on,	 I suppose,	but	I	was	hoping	to	catch	some	weather.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	not	worried?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.”	 She	 had	 her	 own	 glass	 of	 iced	 tea	 sitting	 on	 the	 counter,	 and	 she sipped	from	it	as	she	watched	me	take	the	English	muffin	from	the	toaster	oven</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 start	 spreading	 some	 butter	 on	 it.	 “Cable	 news	 always	 needs	 something	 to feed	 the	 monster.	 And	 unexplained	 diseases	 are	 a	 great	 way	 to	 keep	 people watching	for	updates.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	something	I	loved	about	my	mother	—	she	wasn’t	afraid	to	call	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">spade	 a	 spade.	 Critical	 thinking	 was	 very	 important	 to	 her,	 which	 made	 sense, since	she	taught	advanced	composition	and	AP	English	at	the	same	high	school</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	attended.	She	made	my	father	look	like	a	starry-eyed	dreamer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“True,”	 I	 said,	 munching	 away	 at	 my	 English	 muffin.	 My	 abused	 stomach</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	all	too	glad	of	the	carbs,	which	should	help	to	soak	up	the	remnants	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tequila	I’d	downed	the	night	before.	Good	thing	I	only	indulged	like	that	every</p>
<p class="calibre1">once	in	a	great	while.	Most	of	the	time	I	was	more	a	mixed-drink	kind	of	girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ll	play	it	up,	and	then	it’ll	quietly	disappear,	just	like	everything	else</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	try	to	make	a	big	deal	of.”	My	mother	finished	the	last	of	her	tea	and	set	the glass	down	on	the	counter.	“Anyway,	I’m	about	to	go	to	the	store.	Anything	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">need?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mouth	full	of	English	muffin,	I	shook	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Make	sure	you	wipe	down	the	counter	when	you’re	done,”	she	admonished</p>
<p class="calibre1">me,	 then	 picked	 up	 her	 purse	 and	 went	 out,	 apparently	 not	 concerned	 at	 all	 by what	we’d	just	watched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	only	she’d	been	right.	But	it	turned	out	that	the	worry	of	the	doctor	—	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	scared-looking	reporter	—	was	not	misplaced. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 next	 morning,	 the	 news	 was	 full	 of	 reports	 of	 people	 getting	 sick	 up	 and down	 both	 coasts,	 and	 cases	 had	 been	 reported	 in	 the	 Midwest	 as	 well…</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chicago…Detroit…St.	Louis.	And	the	disease,	whatever	it	was,	hadn’t	confined</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself	 to	 the	 borders	 of	 the	 U.S.	 People	 were	 sick	 in	 London	 and	 Munich	 and Moscow	and	Singapore.	Hospitals	were	filling	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 father	 sat	 in	 his	 wing	 chair	 in	 the	 family	 room	 and	 watched	 the	 news with	 narrowed	 eyes.	 My	 mother	 seemed	 to	 be	 doing	 her	 best	 to	 ignore	 the television,	 and	 was	 instead	 trying	 to	 worm	 the	 latest	 details	 about	 his	 football practice	 schedule	 out	 of	 my	 brother	 Devin,	 who	 was	 far	 more	 interested	 in texting	 with	 his	 girlfriend	 than	 watching	 TV	 or	 explaining	 why	 he	 would	 have practice	 four	 days	 this	 week	 but	 five	 the	 next.	 A	 senior	 in	 high	 school,	 he	 was hoping	his	record	as	running	back	for	the	school’s	team	might	help	him	to	eke</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	a	scholarship	or	two	when	he	went	to	college	next	year.	We	were	doing	okay, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	college	was	expensive	—	as	I	knew	only	too	well,	with	loans	piling	up	every</p>
<p class="calibre1">semester,	loans	I	wasn’t	sure	I’d	ever	be	able	to	pay	back.	Supposedly	having	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">master’s	would	put	me	on	a	higher	rung	of	the	salary	ladder	when	I	did	have	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">go	 out	 into	 the	 real	 world,	 but	 jobs	 were	 scarcer	 than	 the	 college	 counselors wanted	us	poor	schmucks	stuck	in	loan	limbo	to	believe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have	you	seen	any	sick	people	yet?”	I	asked	my	father.	I	was	sitting	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">game	 table	 in	 the	 corner	 of	 the	 family	 room,	 attempting	 to	 give	 my	 paper	 on gender	representation	in	gothic	novels	a	final	read-through	in	hard	copy	to	catch</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	typos.	Unfortunately,	my	brain	was	jittering	this	way	and	that,	worried	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 reports	 on	 the	 news,	 praying	 they	 were	 exaggerating	 and	 fearing	 they	 were not.	I	couldn’t	even	say	why	I	was	so	worried,	since	most	of	the	time	I	ignored</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	sorts	of	reports,	knowing	the	diseases	they	discussed	rarely	touched	us	here in	our	little	corner	of	the	Southwest.	Something	about	the	speed	with	which	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	had	spread	bothered	me,	though.	It	bothered	me	a	lot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 father	 pointed	 the	 remote	 at	 the	 TV	 and	 turned	 down	 the	 volume,	 then shook	his	head.	“Not	with	this	thing.	I’ve	seen	meth	heads	puking	in	back	alleys</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	heroin	addicts	with	the	shakes	because	they	couldn’t	get	a	fix,	but	this	one?	I don’t	think	it’s	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	word	“yet”	hung	in	the	air,	unspoken,	but	no	less	ominous	for	that.	More</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	more	people	were	getting	sick,	and	the	first	deaths	had	been	reported	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">East	 Coast.	 Not	 a	 lot,	 not	 yet,	 but	 although	 the	 news	 was	 trying	 to	 sugarcoat</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>things,	 rumors	 had	 already	 begun	 to	 swirl	 across	 the	 Internet	 that	 no	 one	 who contracted	this	new	disease	survived.	Which	was	crazy.	Even	Ebola	—	hell,	even</p>
<p class="calibre1">pneumonic	 plague,	 which	 had	 an	 insane	 mortality	 rate	 when	 not	 treated	 —</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t	one-hundred-percent	fatal.	That	just	wasn’t	possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	it	won’t,”	I	said,	although	I	knew	even	as	I	said	them	that	the	words</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 mere	 wishful	 thinking.	 “Maybe	 it’ll	 just…blow	 around	 us,	 or	 burn	 out before	it	gets	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe,”	he	agreed.	His	eyes	wouldn’t	meet	mine,	though,	and	I	knew	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	must	be	thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew,	because	it	was	the	same	thing	I	was	thinking.	This	wasn’t	a	matter	of</p>

<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 Monday	 when	 I	 arrived	 at	 school,	 I	 noticed	 the	 parking	 lot	 was	 noticeably less	full	than	a	university	lot	had	any	right	to	be	this	close	to	the	beginning	of	the semester.	 And	 as	 I	 got	 out	 of	 my	 car	 and	 locked	 it,	 I	 saw	 that	 at	 least	 half	 the students	 walking	 around	 on	 campus	 wore	 surgical	 masks,	 the	 white	 disposable kind	the	news	reports	showed	people	in	China	wearing	on	days	when	the	smog</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	particularly	bad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently,	 I	 hadn’t	 gotten	 the	 memo.	 Nothing	 I	 could	 do	 about	 it	 now…</p>
<p class="calibre1">except	hope	that	a	lot	of	the	students	in	the	Writing	1A	class	I	was	teaching	that semester	had	decided	to	bail	completely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	 of	 them	 had,	 except	 for	 a	 couple	 of	 the	 over-achievers.	 Well,	 at	 least the	 kind	 of	 over-achievers	 I’d	 get	 in	 a	 Writing	 1A	 class,	 which	 wasn’t	 exactly packed	full	with	people	who’d	gotten	5s	on	their	AP	English	exams. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	scanned	the	empty	seats	and	tried	not	to	frown,	reminding	myself	that	I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	 my	 T.A.	 stipend	 no	 matter	 how	 many	 butts	 were	 in	 those	 chairs	 on	 a particular	 day.	 “Okay,”	 I	 said,	 surprised	 at	 the	 slight	 tremor	 in	 my	 voice,	 “on Friday	we	were	just	starting	to	get	into	the	difference	between	a	topic	sentence</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	a	thesis	statement….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taylor	 Ortiz,	 who	 was	 sitting	 in	 the	 front	 row,	 blinked	 at	 me	 in	 apparent incomprehension.	For	the	first	time,	I	noticed	the	beads	of	sweat	standing	out	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	forehead,	the	way	she	seemed	to	be	swaying	in	her	seat.	Beneath	her	warm-</p>
<p class="calibre1">toned	skin,	she	looked	dead	pale. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>“Taylor,	are	you	all	right?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	blinked	again.	“Um….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next	to	her,	Troy	Lenz	lurched	to	his	feet.	“Holy	shit!	She’s	got	it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Troy	—	”	I	began,	maybe	meaning	to	reprimand	him	for	swearing	in	class, </p>
<p class="calibre1">possibly	intending	to	tell	him	to	sit	down,	but	I	was	fairly	certain	neither	of	those admonishments	 would	 have	 had	 any	 effect.	 All	 around	 the	 class,	 those	 few students	 who’d	 been	 brave	 enough	 to	 show	 up	 shot	 straight	 out	 of	 their	 seats, looking	at	Taylor	as	if	she’d	just	started	vomiting	pea	soup	or	something.	Never</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind	 that	 vomiting	 was	 not	 one	 of	 the	 symptoms	 of	 “the	 Heat”	 —	 the	 street nickname	given	to	the	disease	because	of	the	extreme	fevers	it	caused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	God,	get	away	from	her,”	a	girl	in	the	back	of	the	class	said,	and	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could	even	open	my	mouth	to	speak	again,	they	were	all	bolting	for	the	door,	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">couple	of	them	even	overturning	their	desks	in	their	haste. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	seconds	later,	I	was	alone	in	the	classroom	with	Taylor,	who	continued</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	look	around	blankly,	seeming	unaware	that	she’d	managed	to	clear	the	space</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	about	five	seconds	flat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	cowardly	part	of	me	wanted	to	take	off	as	well,	but	I	told	myself	I	couldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	 that	 —	 I	 was	 the	 teacher	 (okay,	 the	 T.A.),	 and	 I	 had	 some	 sort	 of responsibility	to	make	sure	she	was	all	right.	Besides,	if	she	really	did	have	the Heat,	then	I’d	already	been	exposed,	and	there	wasn’t	anything	I	could	do	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	approached	her	and	put	a	hand	on	her	forehead.	Jesus	Christ.	She	felt	as	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	was	on	fire	from	within.	No	wonder	she	was	having	a	hard	time	focusing	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything.	She	was	so	hot	that	her	brain	must	be	cooking	right	inside	her	skull. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	university	hospital	was	all	the	way	across	campus.	I	was	stronger	than	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked,	 thanks	 to	 a	 childhood	 spent	 hiking	 and	 walking	 and	 going	 to	 the shooting	range	with	my	father,	but	I	knew	there	was	no	way	I	could	get	Taylor</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	that	distance	by	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shaking,	I	went	to	my	desk	and	pulled	my	purse	out	of	the	drawer	where	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">always	stowed	it.	My	fingers	trembled	as	well	while	I	got	out	my	phone.	Thank</p>
<p class="calibre1">God	it	wasn’t	too	much	work	to	dial	911. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 rang…and	 rang…and	 rang.	 Panic	 started	 to	 set	 in.	 I	 could	 feel	 my	 heart beginning	to	pound	and	my	own	nervous	sweats	starting,	although	I	didn’t	think</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	running	a	fever.	Not	yet,	anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	at	last:	“Nine-one-one,	what	is	your	emergency?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	cleared	my	throat.	“Hi,	my	name	is	Jessica	Monroe,	and	I’m	in	Building	81</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	UNM	campus.	One	of	my	students	is	very	sick	and	unable	to	walk.	I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">pretty	sure	she	needs	to	go	to	the	hospital.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Symptoms?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>“A	very	high	fever.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 could	 have	 sworn	 I	 heard	 a	 muttered	 “shit”	 at	 the	 other	 end	 of	 the	 line, followed	by	a	long	pause.	“Ms.	Monroe,	we	are	experiencing	longer-than-normal</p>
<p class="calibre1">response	times	for	ambulances	due	to	heavy	volume.	We	will	get	someone	out	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">you,	but	it	may	be	a	while.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	didn’t	take	a	rocket	scientist	to	figure	out	what	that	meant.	Maybe	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">lagging	behind,	but	the	Heat	had	finally	come	to	Albuquerque. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	sat	with	Taylor,	since	I	didn’t	know	what	else	to	do.	She	held	on	to	the	edge	of her	desk	as	if	it	was	the	only	thing	keeping	her	anchored	to	reality,	her	head	first lolling	this	way	and	then	that,	her	glassy	dark	eyes	staring	off	into	the	distance, as	 if	 fixed	 on	 some	 object	 only	 she	 could	 see.	 It	 was	 frightening	 enough	 just being	close	to	someone	who	was	that	sick,	but	even	more	frightening	was	how</p>
<p class="calibre1">detached	from	reality	she	seemed	to	be.	We	Monroes	were	a	healthy	lot,	and	so	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t	 have	 a	 lot	 of	 experience	 being	 around	 sick	 people.	 Devin	 got	 a	 horrible stomach	 flu	 one	 year,	 and	 we	 had	 colds	 and	 coughs	 from	 time	 to	 time,	 but nothing	like	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sweat	was	dripping	down	Taylor’s	forehead	and	staining	the	tight	T-shirt	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">wore.	 More	 rivulets	 of	 perspiration	 ran	 down	 into	 her	 cleavage,	 but	 I	 doubted anyone	 would	 have	 found	 the	 sight	 particularly	 sexy.	 For	 myself,	 I	 could	 only think	of	the	millions	of	microbes	she	must	be	spreading	in	every	direction	each</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	she	shifted	in	her	seat.	One	time	she	shook	like	a	dog,	and	little	droplets	of sweat	sprayed	everywhere,	a	few	hitting	me	right	in	the	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 took	 every	 ounce	 of	 willpower	 I	 had	 not	 to	 swear	 out	 loud.	 Belatedly,	 I realized	that	I	had	a	partially	drunk	bottle	of	water	in	my	purse.	I	doubted	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	do	much	to	help	her,	but	at	least	it	was	something.	And	I	had	a	feeling	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	far	past	worrying	about	any	germs	I	might	have	left	behind	on	the	bottle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Taylor?”	 I	 asked.	 No	 recognition	 in	 those	 strained	 dark	 eyes,	 which	 were still	staring	out	at	something	only	visible	to	her.	“How	about	some	water?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	blinked.	Maybe	it	was	the	only	way	she	could	answer,	or	maybe	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">simply	an	involuntary	reflex.	Either	way,	it	gave	me	an	excuse	to	get	up	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">desk	 next	 to	 hers,	 to	 go	 to	 my	 purse	 and	 fetch	 the	 bottle	 of	 water.	 As	 I approached	 her,	 I	 could	 almost	 feel	 the	 heat	 emanating	 from	 her,	 impossibly, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>inhumanly	warm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	 must	 her	 temperature	 be?	 I	 had	 no	 way	 of	 knowing,	 but	 I	 wondered how	anyone	could	stay	alive	and	conscious	—	even	the	fragile	consciousness	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	clinging	to	right	now	—	while	suffering	such	a	high	fever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Taylor,	 here’s	 the	 water.”	 She	 didn’t	 seem	 capable	 of	 taking	 the	 bottle herself,	so	I	held	it	to	her	lips.	For	a	second	she	didn’t	move,	only	let	the	opening rest	against	her	mouth,	and	then	some	lizard-brain	function	must	have	kicked	in, </p>
<p class="calibre1">because	 she	 latched	 onto	 it	 and	 drank	 greedily	 while	 I	 tilted	 the	 rest	 of	 the bottle’s	contents	into	her	mouth.	Within	a	few	seconds,	all	the	water	was	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 all,”	 I	 told	 her,	 but	 she	 didn’t	 seem	 to	 understand,	 even	 lifting	 one hand	to	grab	at	the	bottle	when	I	began	to	pull	it	away.	“Just	rest,	Taylor.	Please. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ambulance	will	be	here	soon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That,	of	course,	was	a	lie.	I	had	no	idea	what	“longer-than-normal	response</p>
<p class="calibre1">times”	might	mean,	since	I’d	never	called	an	ambulance	for	anyone	in	my	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	might	know,	but	even	if	I	could	get	a	hold	of	him,	which	I	doubted, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he’d	probably	read	me	the	riot	act	for	not	getting	out	of	there	the	second	Taylor</p>
<p class="calibre1">started	 to	 display	 symptoms.	 Or	 maybe	 not.	 He	 was	 pretty	 big	 on	 the	 whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">“serve	and	protect”	mentality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Right	now,	though,	I	had	a	feeling	I	was	on	my	own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 pulled	 my	 cell	 phone	 out	 of	 my	 jeans	 pocket	 where	 I’d	 stowed	 it	 and looked	at	the	time.	Fifteen	minutes	since	I’d	called	911.	It	felt	roughly	ten	times that.	A	quarter-hour	response	time	wasn’t	great,	but	it	also	didn’t	feel	too	outside what	 might	 be	 considered	 normal.	 I	 might	 be	 waiting	 much,	 much	 longer	 than this.	Biting	my	lip,	I	went	to	my	contacts	list	and	pushed	the	button	for	campus</p>
<p class="calibre1">security,	 since	 I	 figured	 they	 might	 be	 faster	 than	 the	 paramedics,	 but	 the	 line was	busy.	I	ended	the	call	and	tried	again.	Still	nothing.	Damn	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	if	finally	registering	that	there	was	no	more	water,	Taylor	slumped	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	her	seat,	head	tilting	to	one	side.	Her	body	was	twitching	feebly.	Some	kind	of convulsion?	 Again,	 my	 lack	 of	 experience	 with	 any	 kind	 of	 serious	 illness stymied	me.	Maybe	it	would	be	better	for	her	to	lie	down,	but	the	linoleum	floor</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 to	 be	 far	 less	 comfortable	 than	 the	 chair.	 Since	 it	 had	 been	 a	 warm	 day, nearly	eighty	degrees,	she	didn’t	have	a	sweater	or	jacket	that	I	could	lay	her	on, and	I	hadn’t	brought	one	with	me,	either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Never	before	in	my	life	had	I	felt	so	useless,	standing	there	and	watching	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	sweat	rolled	off	her	and	she	continued	to	jerk	helplessly,	like	her	body	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	controlled	by	some	unseen	puppeteer.	I	went	to	the	browser	on	my	phone, </p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking	that	maybe	I	could	click	over	to	WebMD	or	something	and	see	if	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	anything	else	I	could	do	to	help	her,	but	no	matter	how	many	times	I	backed</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	 of	 the	 browser	 app	 and	 tried	 to	 refresh	 it,	 I	 couldn’t	 get	 the	 damn	 thing	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>connect.	It	wasn’t	the	first	time	my	phone	had	acted	up	like	this,	but	in	general	I had	good	connectivity	here	at	school.	I	had	a	feeling	the	phone	wasn’t	the	real</p>
<p class="calibre1">problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 no,	 I	 didn’t	 want	 to	 think	 about	 that.	 I	 didn’t	 want	 to	 think	 about	 what might	be	going	on	outside	the	door	to	my	classroom,	what	might	be	happening</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	my	parents	or	my	brother. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">No, </i>	I	thought	fiercely.  <i class="calibre3">They’re	fine.	They	have	to	be. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	when	I	was	about	to	give	up	and	dial	911	again,	the	door	burst	inward, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	two	men	carrying	a	stretcher	entered	the	classroom.  <i class="calibre3">Thank	God	you’re	here</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">died	on	my	lips,	because	they	weren’t	wearing	the	usual	dark	jackets	and	pants</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	EMTs,	but	full	head-to-toe	yellow	biohazard	suits,	the	kind	of	gear	I’d	seen	on TV	on	doctors	and	nurses	treating	people	with	Ebola. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	went	straight	to	Taylor,	extricated	her	from	her	desk,	and	laid	her	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	stretcher.	Once	they	were	done	with	that	and	she	was	strapped	in,	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	turned	toward	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Name?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	guessed	they	were	asking	about	Taylor,	not	me.	“Taylor	Ortiz,”	I	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	her	purse	right	there	on	the	floor.	It	should	have	her	I.D.	in	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 EMT	 grabbed	 her	 purse	 by	 the	 strap	 and	 lifted	 it	 from	 the	 floor,	 then extracted	 her	 wallet	 from	 within.	 He	 opened	 it,	 glanced	 at	 her	 driver’s	 license, and	then	nodded	and	dropped	the	wallet	back	in	her	purse.	“You?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me?”	I	blinked	at	him,	then	responded,	“Jessica	Monroe.	I’m	the	T.A.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	are	you	feeling?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Scared. </i>	“Fine.	That	is,	I	don’t	feel	like	I’m	running	a	fever	or	anything.”	Did that	even	matter?	I	hadn’t	heard	what	the	incubation	period	was	for	the	Heat,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	assumed	it	didn’t	have	instantaneous	onset.	No	disease	did…or	did	it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	straight	home,”	the	EMT	said.	“No	contact	with	anyone	else.	If	you	start</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	exhibit	symptoms,	don’t	call	your	doctor.	Go	straight	to	the	hospital.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But….”	 The	 word	 trailed	 off	 as	 I	 attempted	 to	 gather	 my	 thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	about	this	didn’t	feel	right.	No,	wait,	scratch	that	—	 <i class="calibre3">nothing</i>	about	it felt	right.	I’d	been	exposed	to	someone	who	obviously	had	the	Heat.	Shouldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	be	quarantining	me	or	something? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	EMT’s	hooded	head	tilted	to	one	side	as	he	waited	for	me	to	spit	it	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said,	“If	she’s	sick,	haven’t	I	been	infected,	too?	Don’t	I,	I	don’t	know,	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	be	isolated	or	something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	don’t	have	the	facilities	for	that.	Best	thing	to	do	is	go	home	and	stay</p>
<p class="calibre1">away	from	other	people.	If	you	do	get	sick,	get	to	the	hospital.	That’s	all	I	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 he	 nodded	 at	 his	 compatriot,	 and	 they	 both	 crouched	 down	 and	 lifted</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>the	stretcher,	hauling	Taylor	out	of	the	room.	It	was	only	after	the	door	had	shut behind	them	that	I	realized	they’d	left	her	purse	behind,	as	if	who	she	was	didn’t matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	phone	went	off	then,	and	I	looked	down	at	the	text	that	had	just	appeared</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 my	 home	 screen.  <i class="calibre3">Due	 to	 health	 emergency,	 all	 classes	 are	 suspended</i> <i class="calibre3">indefinitely.	 We	 ask	 that	 all	 students	 go	 to	 their	 residences	 immediately	 and</i> <i class="calibre3">remain	there	until	further	notice. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">So	the	university’s	student	alert	system	had	finally	kicked	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Too	bad	that	it	was	already	too	late. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><img src="index-18_2.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">TWO</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	campus	was	mostly	deserted	when	I	emerged	from	the	classroom	at	a	little</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	noon	and	locked	the	door	behind	me.	In	a	way	that	was	good,	as	at	least	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t	have	to	play	dodge	’em	with	anyone	who	looked	infected.	But	there	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	a	long	line	of	cars	waiting	to	get	out	of	the	parking	lot,	and	I	sat	there,	worry mounting	as	the	minutes	ticked	past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	 did	 it	 feel	 like	 when	 the	 Heat	 came	 over	 you?	 A	 sudden	 spike	 in temperature?	 Or	 was	 it	 a	 slow,	 gradual	 burn,	 until	 you,	 like	 a	 lobster	 in	 a	 pot, ended	up	boiling	in	your	own	juices? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 didn’t	 know.	 And	 all	 this	 had	 happened	 so	 quickly	 that	 there	 hadn’t	 been much	detail	on	the	news,	either.	Or	maybe	they’d	repressed	what	they	did	know, </p>
<p class="calibre1">lest	they	throw	everyone	into	a	panic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	last	I	was	able	to	pull	out	on	Central,	then	headed	west.	Did	I	dare	take</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	freeway	to	get	home?	All	around	me,	the	streets	were	choked,	full	of	people</p>
<p class="calibre1">obviously	trying	to	get	to	their	own	homes,	so	I	had	a	feeling	the	freeway	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	bad	idea.	Instead,	I	ended	up	zigzagging	my	way	out	of	the	downtown	area, </p>
<p class="calibre1">finally	 making	 it	 over	 to	 12th	 so	 I	 could	 head	 north.	 A	 few	 more	 zigzags,	 and then	 I	 was	 back	 in	 a	 residential	 section,	 although	 still	 a	 few	 miles	 from	 home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	less	traffic	here,	although	I	noticed	more	cars	on	the	streets	than	there normally	would	have	been	in	the	middle	of	the	day	when	everyone	should	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	at	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>A	sigh	of	relief	escaped	my	lips	as	I	pulled	up	in	front	of	the	house	and	I	saw my	mother’s	Escape	parked	in	the	driveway.	No	sign	of	Dad’s	Grand	Cherokee, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 the	 police	 cruiser	 he	 sometimes	 brought	 home.	 But	 at	 least	 my	 mother	 was here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	scrambled	out	of	the	car,	then	hurried	down	the	driveway	to	let	myself	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	back	door.	We	almost	never	came	and	went	through	the	front,	mostly	because</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	mother	was	unnecessarily	fussy	about	the	Berber	carpet	in	the	living	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Better	 to	 track	 dirt	 through	 the	 kitchen,	 which	 had	 abused	 linoleum	 she’d	 been wanting	to	get	rid	of	for	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mom?”	I	called	out	as	I	came	in	through	the	service	porch,	then	on	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jess?”	 she	 called	 back.	 I	 heard	 feet	 approaching	 from	 the	 hallway	 that	 ran down	the	middle	of	the	house.	When	she	came	around	the	corner,	I	saw	that	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">face	 was	 dead	 white.	 She	 let	 out	 a	 little	 choked	 sob	 when	 she	 saw	 me.	 “Oh, thank	God.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	any	other	time	her	reaction	might	have	startled	me,	but	not	now.	Not	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	had	just	happened	to	Taylor	Ortiz.	“I’m	fine,”	I	said.	“Only	—	” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	brows	drew	together.	“Only?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	girl	in	my	class	—	she	had	it.	The	EMTs	came	and	got	her,	but	they	sent</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	home.	It’s	probably	better	if	you	don’t	come	too	close.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 God,”	 she	 said,	 this	 time	 invoking	 the	 name	 in	 horror	 rather	 than	 in relief.	 She	 appeared	 to	 gather	 herself,	 voice	 strained	 as	 she	 went	 on,	 “How	 do you	feel?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	paused	to	take	stock.	“Okay,	actually,”	I	told	her.	It	was	true,	too.	Yes,	I	was a	 little	 shaken	 after	 being	 that	 close	 to	 someone	 that	 sick,	 and	 then	 having	 to fight	 my	 way	 home	 through	 hordes	 of	 panicky	 motorists,	 but	 otherwise,	 I	 felt fine.	No	fever.	No	chills.	No	sweats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	 what	 I’d	 just	 told	 her	 about	 staying	 away,	 she	 took	 a	 step	 closer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Motherly	instinct,	I	supposed.	She	had	to	reassure	herself	that	I	was	all	right	and not	merely	take	my	word	for	it.	But	because	she	was	a	smart	woman,	she	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	close	enough	to	see	for	herself	that	I	wasn’t	flushed	or	feverish	or	sweaty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	long	pause,	she	nodded.	“I	keep	flipping	through	the	stations,	trying</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 see	 if	 someone	 is	 giving	 out	 any	 concrete	 information.	 What	 the	 incubation period	is.	How	infectious	the	disease	is.	The	—	the	mortality	rate.”	She	pulled	in a	breath.	“And	there’s	nothing,	except	that	the	situation	is	being	handled	and	that people	should	stay	home	whenever	possible.	What	kind	of	a	policy	is	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 didn’t	 know.	 I	 would	 have	 assumed	 that	 in	 most	 cases	 of	 infection,	 the CDC	would	have	send	out	teams	to	quarantine	people	and	triage	those	affected, </p>
<p class="calibre1">would	do	everything	possible	to	keep	the	disease	from	spreading	any	further.	Or</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>at	least,	that	was	what	I’d	observed	on	TV	when	the	news	covered	outbreaks	of bird	flu	or	whatever.	But	I’d	seen	no	real	government	presence	on	my	way	home</p>
<p class="calibre1">today,	 no	 squads	 of	 experts	 in	 biohazard	 gear,	 no	 blacked-out	 SUVs	 speeding down	the	street,	no…nothing.	It	was	as	if	this	thing	was	spreading	so	quickly	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">government	couldn’t	begin	to	contain	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 thought	 was	 too	 frightening,	 though,	 and	 I	 quickly	 pushed	 it	 away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead,	I	asked,	“Dad?	Devin?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	glanced	away	from	me,	her	mouth	tight.	“I	can’t	reach	your	father.	I	sent</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	text	to	Devin,	telling	him	to	come	home,	but	he	hasn’t	answered	me.	I	called</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	school	and	got	a	recording	that	classes	had	been	canceled	and	everyone	sent</p>
<p class="calibre1">home.	 So	 my	 best	 guess	 is	 he’s	 taking	 the	 opportunity	 to	 have	 a	 little unsupervised	time	with	Lori.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lori	was	his	girlfriend.	The	two	had	been	joined	at	the	hip	since	spring	break</p>
<p class="calibre1">last	year,	and	I	had	a	feeling	my	mother’s	guess	was	all	too	correct.	“Did	you	try calling	her	house?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	 course	 I	 did.	 No	 answer.	 And	 I	 don’t	 have	 her	 cell	 number	 —	 Devin would	never	give	it	to	me.	At	the	time,	I	didn’t	think	it	was	worth	nagging	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	it.	Now….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sure	it’s	fine,”	I	said	quickly.	No	point	in	having	my	mother	worry	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	than	absolutely	necessary.	“If	they’re	at	Lori’s	house,	then	at	least	they’re inside	and	away	from	other	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“True,	but….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	she	would	fret	about	this	until	Devin	appeared,	whenever	that	was.	In</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 moment,	 fury	 flashed	 through	 me,	 that	 he	 would	 be	 so	 selfish	 as	 to	 go	 off and	bang	his	girlfriend	or	whatever	while	the	rest	of	us	were	worried	sick	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.	 Uttering	 such	 a	 thing	 out	 loud	 would	 just	 set	 my	 mother	 off	 that	 much more,	 though,	 so	 I	 only	 said,	 “Why	 don’t	 you	 have	 some	 tea	 while	 you’re waiting?	 I	 need	 to	 go	 up	 to	 my	 apartment	 and	 wash	 my	 hands	 and	 get</p>
<p class="calibre1">straightened	up,	but	I’ll	be	right	back	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	eyes	were	far	away,	but	she	nodded.	“That	sounds	like	a	good	idea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 sent	 her	 what	 I	 hoped	 was	 an	 encouraging	 smile,	 then	 went	 out	 the	 back door	and	down	the	driveway	to	the	detached	garage.	The	apartment	built	over	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	small,	just	a	little	over	four	hundred	square	feet,	so	there	was	a	tiny	living room,	 a	 spot	 under	 one	 window	 for	 a	 table	 and	 two	 chairs,	 a	 kitchenette,	 and then	 the	 bedroom	 and	 bath,	 which	 was	 so	 small	 I	 could	 reach	 out	 from	 the shower	 stall	 and	 open	 the	 door	 if	 I	 had	 to.	 But	 at	 least	 it	 was	 mine,	 and	 it	 felt good	to	escape	there,	to	hurry	up	the	stairs	and	run	to	the	bathroom	so	I	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">turn	 on	 the	 water	 as	 hot	 as	 I	 could	 stand	 it,	 then	 let	 it	 run	 over	 my	 hands	 as	 I scrubbed	them	again	and	again	with	antibacterial	soap. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>As	if	that	would	make	a	difference.	It	was	better	than	nothing,	though,	and	I couldn’t	 think	 of	 what	 else	 to	 do.	 My	 eyes	 stared	 back	 at	 me	 from	 within	 the mirror,	wide	and	dark,	shadowed	with	worry.	I	was	pale,	but	I	didn’t	look	sick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 blotting	 my	 hands	 on	 a	 towel,	 I	 reached	 up	 and	 felt	 my	 forehead.	 It didn’t	 seem	 overly	 warm,	 but	 I’d	 always	 heard	 you	 couldn’t	 really	 detect	 your own	temperature	by	doing	that.	So	I	opened	the	medicine	cabinet	and	pulled	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 digital	 thermometer	 I	 kept	 there.	 After	 cleaning	 it	 off	 with	 some	 rubbing alcohol,	I	popped	it	in	my	mouth	and	waited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	seconds	went	by	with	agonizing	slowness.	I	wandered	out	to	the	living</p>
<p class="calibre1">room	and	sat	down	on	the	futon,	wondering	whether	I	should	turn	on	my	TV,	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	I	could	find	anything	worth	watching.	But	then,	if	my	mother	had	been	unable</p>
<p class="calibre1">to,	what	made	me	think	I	would	have	any	better	luck? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead,	I	stared	out	the	window	at	the	tree	outside,	a	honey	locust,	its	leaves</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	 beginning	 to	 turn	 yellow.	 It	 was	 warm	 during	 the	 day,	 but	 the	 nights	 were already	cold.	The	tree	knew	its	time	was	coming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Did	I? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	thermometer	beeped,	indicating	it	was	done	measuring	my	temperature, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	pulled	it	out	of	my	mouth.	For	the	longest	moment,	I	only	held	it,	scared	to look	at	what	the	readout	might	say.	Finally,	I	forced	myself	to	glance	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">97.6</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	breath	whooshed	out	of	me,	and	I	dropped	the	thermometer	on	top	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">coffee	table.	No	temperature	at	all.	On	the	low	side,	actually. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 what	 did	 that	 mean?	 Once	 you	 were	 infected,	 how	 long	 did	 it	 take	 for your	fever	to	start	building? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	know.	All	I	did	know	was	that	I	wasn’t	sick.	Not	yet,	anyway.	And</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	left	my	mother	alone	long	enough.	Even	if	I	couldn’t	sit	next	to	her,	I	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	close	enough	so	we	could	talk,	and	that	would	help	to	keep	her	from	worrying</p>
<p class="calibre1">until	Devin	came	home.	Which	he	would,	eventually,	after	he’d	gotten	his	rocks</p>
<p class="calibre1">off.	 I	 loved	 my	 little	 brother,	 but	 sometimes	 he	 wasn’t	 the	 most	 considerate	 of other	people’s	feelings.	Well,	other	people	who	weren’t	his	girlfriend,	that	is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 closing	 the	 door	 to	 my	 apartment	 but	 not	 locking	 it,	 I	 went	 back	 into the	 main	 house,	 past	 the	 washer	 and	 dryer	 and	 the	 overflow	 pantry	 where	 my mother	put	all	the	big	containers	of	items	from	Costco,	the	sort	of	stuff	that	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">“such	a	good	deal	she	couldn’t	pass	it	up.”	What	in	the	world	we	were	going	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	with	that	much	tomato	sauce	or	rolled	oats,	I	had	no	idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 must	 have	 turned	 the	 television	 on,	 because	 I	 could	 hear	 it	 blathering away	as	I	approached.	“…everyone	is	encouraged	to	stay	inside	and	away	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">people	with	obvious	signs	of	infection.	If	a	fever	presents,	take	analgesics	such</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 aspirin	 or	 ibuprofen.	 Ice	 packs	 are	 also	 effective.	 If	 the	 fever	 rises	 to	 above</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>103	degrees	Fahrenheit,	go	to	your	nearest	emergency	room….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stopped	dead	at	the	entrance	to	the	kitchen.	Not	because	I	didn’t	want	to	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	closer	to	my	mother,	but	because	I	knew	it	really	didn’t	matter	whether	I	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">infected	or	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 body	 was	 sprawled	 on	 the	 kitchen	 floor,	 limp,	 one	 of	 her	 low-heeled pumps	hanging	half	off	her	foot.	Panic	flashed	through	me,	so	quick	and	sudden</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 I	 could	 actually	 feel	 my	 knees	 beginning	 to	 buckle.	 I	 grabbed	 on	 to	 the doorframe	 for	 support,	 telling	 myself	 I	 didn’t	 have	 time	 to	 lose	 it	 right	 now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	swallowing	a	huge	gulp	of	air,	I	said,	“Mom?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	reply,	but	then	I	heard	her	breathing,	rapid	and	shallow,	like	our	old	dog</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sadie	after	a	particularly	strenuous	walk.	We’d	lost	Sadie	last	winter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stupid	of	me	to	be	thinking	of	that	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 went	 into	 the	 kitchen	 and	 knelt	 down	 next	 to	 my	 mother,	 reaching	 out	 to touch	 her	 shoulder.	 The	 skin	 under	 the	 silk	 blouse	 she’d	 worn	 to	 work	 was almost	scorching,	or	at	least	it	felt	that	way	to	my	shaky	fingers.	“Mom?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	faintest	of	groans.	It	wasn’t	much,	but	it	was	a	sign	that	she	could	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear	 me,	 hadn’t	 yet	 retreated	 so	 far	 that	 she	 couldn’t	 even	 react	 to	 outside stimuli. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obviously,	I	couldn’t	leave	her	here.	My	parents’	bedroom	was	upstairs,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	quailed	at	the	thought	of	trying	to	move	her	all	the	way	up	the	flight	of	stairs that	led	to	the	second	story.	Maybe	I	could	just	lay	her	down	on	the	couch	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">family	room?	At	least	until	my	father	got	home,	and	then	the	two	of	us	could	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 properly	 in	 bed.	 Even	 then	 I	 knew	 calling	 an	 ambulance	 was	 pointless.	 I couldn’t	count	on	anyone	to	come,	so	I	figured	the	best	thing	to	do	was	to	get	her as	comfortable	as	possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	her	by	the	shoulders,	and,	as	gently	as	I	could,	rolled	her	over	so	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 facing	 upward.	 She	 whimpered	 during	 this	 procedure,	 sounding	 so	 unlike herself	 that	 I	 felt	 a	 frightened	 little	 sob	 escape	 my	 throat.	 Luckily,	 she	 was	 far enough	gone	that	she	couldn’t	really	hear	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Telling	myself	that	this	was	the	best	thing	to	do,	that	I	couldn’t	leave	her	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	floor,	I	half-carried,	half-dragged	her	into	the	family	room	and	then	somehow</p>
<p class="calibre1">manhandled	 her	 up	 onto	 the	 couch.	 The	 scary	 thing	 was	 that	 she	 didn’t	 even protest,	 didn’t	 try	 to	 push	 back	 against	 me	 or	 do	 anything,	 really.	 It	 was	 like moving	a	rag	doll	around	—	a	130-pound	rag	doll,	anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 at	 last	 she	 was	 safely	 on	 the	 couch.	 I	 took	 the	 throw	 that	 always	 lay folded	 over	 one	 arm	 and	 spread	 it	 out	 across	 her.	 Another	 one	 of	 those	 little whimpers,	 as	 if	 she	 thought	 that	 would	 make	 her	 too	 hot,	 but	 knew	 she	 had	 to have	some	sort	of	covering.	Then	she	subsided,	eyes	shut	tight,	chest	rising	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">falling	far	too	rapidly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>All	 of	 the	 first	 aid	 supplies	 were	 in	 the	 medicine	 cabinet	 in	 the	 upstairs bathroom,	the	one	Devin	and	I	used	to	share	before	I	moved	into	the	apartment</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	the	garage.	After	taking	another	look	at	my	mother	and	deciding	she	should</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	okay	for	a	minute	or	so,	I	hurried	up	the	stairs,	moving	as	quickly	as	I	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">without	actually	running.	When	I	got	to	the	bathroom,	I	opened	the	cabinet,	took</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	 the	 jumbo	 container	 of	 Kirkland	 ibuprofen,	 and	 shook	 a	 couple	 into	 my hand.	I	also	took	out	the	thermometer.	Yes,	it	was	obvious	my	mother	had	a	high</p>
<p class="calibre1">fever…but	 <i class="calibre3">how</i>	high?	Past	the	magic	number	of	103? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	to	hope	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 dashed	 back	 down	 the	 stairs.	 She	 hadn’t	 moved,	 although	 I	 noticed	 she’d pushed	 the	 throw	 off	 her	 chest,	 down	 to	 her	 waist.	 Her	 blouse	 and	 skirt	 were getting	 wrinkled,	 but	 I	 couldn’t	 do	 much	 about	 that.	 Another	 thing	 my	 father would	have	to	help	me	with	when	he	got	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	he	got	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Don’t	go	there, </i>	I	told	myself.  <i class="calibre3">He’ll	be	here.	He	will. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	just	didn’t	know	what	he’d	find	when	he	eventually	did	make	it	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	pills	were	cool	in	my	palm.	I	realized	then	that	I’d	forgotten	to	get	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">water	for	my	mother	to	take	them	with,	so	I	went	into	the	kitchen,	filled	a	glass</p>
<p class="calibre1">halfway,	 and	 went	 back	 out	 to	 the	 family	 room.	 She	 hadn’t	 moved,	 was	 lying there	twitching	and	shaking	the	way	Taylor	Ortiz	had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mom,”	I	said	softly.	She	didn’t	seem	to	acknowledge	me,	so	I	didn’t	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	 she’d	 really	 heard	 me	 or	 not.	 Maybe	 my	 saying	 her	 name	 was	 to	 reassure myself	as	much	as	it	was	to	let	her	know	I	was	there.	“Here’s	some	water,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	pills	for	your	fever.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	slipped	my	arm	under	her	shoulders	and	lifted	her	a	few	inches,	just	enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	I	could	bring	the	water	to	her	lips.	Like	Taylor,	she	drank	greedily,	gulping	so much	that	I	had	to	pull	the	glass	away	so	there	would	be	enough	left	for	her	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">take	the	pills. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	first	one,”	I	told	her,	slipping	one	of	the	ibuprofen	capsules	between</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	lips.	It	just	sort	of	sat	there	on	her	tongue,	so	I	poured	more	water	into	her mouth.	 Her	 swallow	 reflex	 cut	 in,	 and	 she	 downed	 the	 pill	 without	 too	 much trouble.	The	second	one	was	a	little	more	difficult,	but	she	did	finally	take	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 that	 procedure,	 I	 realized	 I	 should’ve	 taken	 her	 temperature	 first,	 that the	water	might	make	the	reading	inaccurate.	Since	there	wasn’t	anything	I	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	about	it	at	the	moment,	I	sat	down	in	one	of	the	armchairs,	figuring	if	I	waited a	few	minutes,	it	would	probably	be	safe	to	try	the	thermometer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Waiting	 was	 bad,	 though.	 If	 all	 I	 was	 doing	 was	 sitting	 there	 and	 watching my	mother	shake	and	shiver	on	the	couch,	then	I	had	plenty	of	time	to	think…</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	thinking	was	the	last	thing	I	wanted	to	do.	My	thoughts	chased	one	another</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>around	 and	 around,	 worrying	 at	 each	 other,	 fretting,	 biting.	 What	 if	 my	 father never	 came	 home?	 What	 if	 Devin	 had	 fallen	 sick	 at	 Lori’s?	 What	 if	 they	 were <i class="calibre3">both</i>	sick? </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	above	all,  <i class="calibre3">Why	isn’t	anyone	helping	us? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could	feel	myself	starting	to	shake,	but	I	didn’t	think	it	was	from	a	fever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No,	 I	 guessed	 it	 was	 just	 good	 old-fashioned	 fear	 with	 an	 extra	 helping	 of uncertainty.	 Clenching	 my	 hands	 together,	 I	 willed	 them	 to	 stop	 trembling.	 My mother	was	probably	too	out	of	it	to	really	notice,	but	I	didn’t	want	my	fingers</p>
<p class="calibre1">shaking	when	I	finally	did	take	her	temperature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	I	couldn’t	think	of	anything	else	to	do,	I	picked	up	the	remote	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">TV	 and	 switched	 it	 on,	 quickly	 lowering	 the	 volume	 so	 it	 wouldn’t	 disturb	 my mother.	 As	 I	 flipped	 from	 channel	 to	 channel,	 I	 didn’t	 see	 anything	 that	 was remotely	 reassuring.	 More	 talking	 heads,	 discussing	 self-quarantine	 procedures and	 dispensing	 advice	 how	 you	 shouldn’t	 go	 out	 or	 come	 into	 contact	 with anyone	 if	 you	 had	 any	 symptoms,	 and	 if	 you	 did	 come	 down	 with	 a	 fever,	 to make	 sure	 you	 wore	 a	 mask	 or	 tied	 some	 kind	 of	 barrier	 over	 your	 nose	 and mouth	when	it	came	time	to	go	to	the	emergency	room.	And	all	of	them	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">pale	and	strained,	and	were	giving	the	side-eye	to	one	another	when	they	thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 others	 weren’t	 looking,	 as	 if	 trying	 to	 detect	 signs	 that	 one	 of	 their	 fellow newscasters	 might	 be	 starting	 to	 show	 symptoms.	 On	 one	 channel,	 I	 caught	 a pretty	young	woman	who	didn’t	look	much	older	than	I	sending	furtive	glances</p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhere	 off-camera,	 as	 if	 at	 someone	 who	 was	 standing	 by	 and	 monitoring what	they	were	all	saying.	That	couldn’t	be	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 all	 the	 people	 being	 sent	 to	 emergency	 rooms,	 hospitals	 had	 to	 be overwhelmed.	I	wondered	how	many	people	were	sick,	and	how	many	were	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">me,	exposed	but	still	asymptomatic.	Maybe	fifty-fifty?	I	couldn’t	even	begin	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">guess.	 All	 I	 did	 know	 was	 that	 I	 didn’t	 see	 how	 hospitals	 could	 even	 begin	 to keep	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annoyed	that	all	the	stations	were	repeating	the	same	useless	information,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned	off	the	television	and	picked	up	the	thermometer.	My	mother	really	didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">want	to	take	it,	but	after	a	bit	of	wrestling,	I	got	it	shoved	between	her	lips	and more	or	less	under	her	tongue.	Her	skin	felt	clammy	and	hot	at	the	same	time, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which	I	doubted	was	a	good	sign.	Maybe	two	ibuprofen	weren’t	enough.	Maybe</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	should	have	given	her	three,	or	even	four. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or	maybe	I	could	have	poured	the	whole	damn	bottle	down	her	throat,	and	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	wouldn’t	have	done	a	bit	of	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clenching	my	jaw,	I	sat	and	looked	out	the	window	at	the	trees	moving	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">gentle	September	breeze,	at	the	sparrow	who	landed	on	one	branch	and	cocked</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 head	 in	 my	 direction,	 almost	 as	 if	 he	 could	 see	 me	 sitting	 inside,	 watching</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>him.	The	window	in	the	family	room	faced	out	onto	the	side	yard	and	the	fence that	separated	us	from	the	Montoyas	next	door.	I	didn’t	see	any	movement	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">there,	which	most	days	wouldn’t	have	been	that	unusual.	It	was	the	middle	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">day;	 both	 the	 Montoyas	 worked	 full-time,	 and	 their	 kids	 were	 in	 grade	 school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 the	 schools	 were	 closed,	 and	 it	 seemed	 as	 if	 most	 places	 of	 business	 were shutting	up	and	sending	their	employees	home	as	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Were	they	home,	but	ill?	Or	well	enough,	but	hiding,	not	wanting	to	take	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">risk	of	being	exposed?	I	didn’t	know,	and	I	had	my	hands	full	here.	If	my	father</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	home,	I’d	probably	go	over	and	check	on	them,	but	until	then…. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 thermometer	 beeped	 at	 me,	 and	 I	 gently	 drew	 it	 from	 my	 mother’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">mouth	and	looked	at	the	readout.	Then	I	squeezed	my	eyes	shut,	certain	they	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	be	reading	it	wrong,	that	they	were	tricking	me	in	some	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	opened	them	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">106.8. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Was	that	possible? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 supposed	 it	 had	 to	 be,	 since	 that	 was	 what	 the	 thermometer	 was	 saying.	 I also	had	a	feeling	that	two	ibuprofen	might	not	be	cutting	it	here.	Okay,	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">news	they	were	saying	to	apply	cool	cloths,	so	that	seemed	to	be	the	next	step. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	right	after	I	called	911.	Maybe	that	wouldn’t	do	any	good,	but	right	then	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	so	scared	by	my	mother’s	temperature	that	I	had	to	at	least	try	to	get	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	I	set	the	thermometer	back	down	on	the	coffee	table,	I	got	up	and	went</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 kitchen,	 where	 my	 parents	 still	 had	 an	 old-fashioned	 corded	 phone mounted	on	the	wall.	Devin	and	I	had	both	laughed	at	it,	but	my	father	had	given</p>
<p class="calibre1">us	the	evil	eye	and	said	that	land	lines	were	way	more	reliable	than	cell	phones, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	that	one	day	we	might	be	very	glad	of	that	old	push-button	phone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 lifted	 the	 receiver	 from	 its	 cradle,	 but	 when	 I	 put	 it	 to	 my	 ear,	 all	 I	 heard was	a	fast	busy	signal,	the	kind	you	get	when	the	phone	service	is	out.	Scowling, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 jiggled	 the	 hook,	 then	 listened	 again.	 Still	 nothing.	 So	 much	 for	 good	 old-fashioned	technology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 cell	 phone	 was	 upstairs	 in	 my	 apartment,	 still	 in	 my	 purse	 where	 I’d dropped	 it	 on	 the	 floor	 by	 the	 door.	 I	 really	 didn’t	 want	 to	 leave	 my	 mother alone,	but	I	needed	to	see	if	the	cell	network	was	functioning	any	better	than	the land	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 peeking	 into	 the	 family	 room	 and	 reassuring	 myself	 that	 she	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">resting	 as	 well	 as	 she	 could	 be,	 all	 things	 considered,	 I	 let	 myself	 out	 and climbed	the	steps	to	my	apartment	two	at	a	time.	Since	I	hadn’t	locked	the	door, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it	only	took	a	few	seconds	for	me	to	get	in,	pull	the	phone	out	of	my	purse,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">dial	911. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	sorry	—	all	circuits	are	currently	busy.	Please	try	again	later.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>The	computer-generated	voice	sounded	positively	snotty.	Somehow	I	resisted the	urge	to	fling	my	cell	phone	against	the	wall,	since	I	knew	that	wouldn’t	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	good.	Instead,	I	stuffed	it	into	the	pocket	of	my	jeans	and	hurried	back	to	the house.	I	sure	would	try	again	later,	but	in	the	meantime,	I	had	to	do	what	I	could to	take	care	of	my	mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	condition	didn’t	seem	to	have	worsened	during	the	couple	of	minutes	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 gone.	 That	 was	 something.	 I	 got	 a	 few	 dish	 towels	 out	 of	 the	 drawer	 and dampened	them	with	cold	water,	then	went	into	the	family	room	and	laid	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">across	 her	 forehead.	 Some	 of	 the	 moisture	 dripped	 on	 her	 gray	 silk	 blouse, leaving	damp	blotches.	I	hoped	they	wouldn’t	leave	stains. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Seriously,	you’re	worrying	about	a	couple	of	stains	at	a	time	like	this? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	supposed	I	was	fixating	on	that,	just	because	it	was	easier	to	worry	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	like	ruining	my	mother’s	clothes	rather	than	the	big-picture	stuff,	like how	 none	 of	 the	 phones	 were	 working.	 Yes,	 I’d	 heard	 how	 that	 could	 happen after	 some	 kind	 of	 disaster,	 but	 Albuquerque	 wasn’t	 really	 prone	 to	 disasters, whether	natural	or	man-made. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 back	 door	 slammed,	 and	 my	 mother	 started,	 then	 began	 twitching	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">shaking	again.	Damn.	And	I’d	just	gotten	her	to	a	place	where	she	seemed	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	 or	 less	 resting	 comfortably.	 But	 maybe	 that	 slamming	 door	 meant	 my father	had	come	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	readjusted	the	damp	towel	on	my	mother’s	forehead,	then	got	up	and	went</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	the	kitchen.	Devin	was	getting	a	glass	out	of	the	cupboard	as	I	entered.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	 fine	 —	 no	 flushed	 cheeks,	 no	 sheen	 of	 sweat	 —	 and	 in	 that	 moment	 I wasn’t	sure	whether	I	wanted	to	hug	him	in	relief	or	punch	him	in	the	arm	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">making	us	worry	like	that	about	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	the	hell	have	you	been?”	I	demanded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lori’s,”	he	replied,	going	to	the	refrigerator	and	getting	some	ice	and	water</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	of	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	you	scared	the	crap	out	of	Mom.	She	couldn’t	get	a	hold	of	you	—	” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shrugged.	“I	sent	a	text.	Maybe	it	didn’t	go	through.	Anyway,	they	sent</p>
<p class="calibre1">us	 home,	 and	 Lori	 couldn’t	 get	 in	 touch	 with	 either	 of	 her	 parents,	 so	 she	 was freaking	out.	So	I	stayed	with	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,”	 I	 said,	 feeling	 some	 of	 my	 righteous	 indignation	 begin	 to	 seep	 away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lori	 was	 an	 only	 child,	 and	 a	 little	 coddled,	 so	 I	 could	 see	 why	 she’d	 be	 more than	ordinarily	upset	at	not	being	able	to	contact	her	parents.	“Is	she	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	 her	 mom	 finally	 got	 a	 text	 through	 and	 said	 she	 was	 on	 her	 way home,	 so	 I	 thought	 I’d	 better	 get	 over	 here.”	 His	 gaze	 sharpened	 on	 me,	 and	 I wondered	 what	 he	 saw.	 Lord	 knows,	 I	 was	 starting	 to	 feel	 kind	 of	 overloaded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>“I’m	 fine,	 but	 Mom	 isn’t,”	 I	 replied	 bluntly.	 Maybe	 too	 bluntly,	 because	 he almost	dropped	the	glass	he	was	holding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	—	she’s	not	sick,	is	she?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	She	just	got	the	fever	about	a	half	hour	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beneath	his	end-of-summer	tan,	my	brother’s	face	drained	of	all	color.	“She</p>
<p class="calibre1">can’t	be	sick!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Right	then	he	didn’t	look	like	the	big,	broad-shouldered	running	back,	but	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">scared	kid.	I	wanted	to	go	hug	him,	but	lately	he’d	been	scorning	such	sisterly</p>
<p class="calibre1">displays	 of	 emotion,	 so	 I	 wasn’t	 sure	 how	 he	 would	 react.	 Instead,	 I	 kept	 my voice	 calm	 as	 I	 told	 him,	 “She	 had	 a	 high	 fever,	 but	 I	 got	 her	 to	 take	 some ibuprofen,	 and	 she’s	 resting	 now	 with	 some	 cold	 cloths	 on	 her	 head.	 So	 far,	 so good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 sounded	 very	 reasonable,	 very	 steady.	 Never	 mind	 that	 I	 didn’t	 really believe	it.	If	this	disease	really	was	at	all	survivable,	that	information	would’ve been	all	over	the	news	by	now.	The	complete	radio	silence	on	the	actual	facts	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	disease	told	me	that	it	was	beyond	dire…it	was	catastrophic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 words	 didn’t	 seem	 to	 reassure	 Devin.	 He	 gave	 me	 a	 stricken	 look	 and then	 went	 into	 the	 family	 room,	 where	 he	 stopped	 a	 few	 feet	 away	 from	 the couch	and	stared	down	at	our	mother.	She	seemed	to	be	sleeping,	but	something</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	 off	 about	 her	 face,	 as	 if	 her	 cheeks	 and	 eye	 sockets	 had	 begun	 to	 look sunken,	far	too	shadowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No,	that	couldn’t	be	right.	It	had	to	be	a	trick	of	the	lighting	in	the	room;	I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">pulled	the	drapes	almost	closed	so	the	afternoon	light	that	was	beginning	to	slant into	the	space	wouldn’t	disturb	her.	Just	some	sort	of	strange	optical	illusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only	I	feared	that	wasn’t	it	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Devin	 appeared	 to	 be	 of	 the	 same	 mind.	 He	 stood	 there,	 hands	 hanging</p>
<p class="calibre1">helplessly	 at	 his	 sides,	 as	 he	 stared	 down	 at	 her.	 Finally,	 he	 whispered,	 “She’s going	to	die,	isn’t	she?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	that	moment,	I	was	furious	with	him	for	giving	voice	to	that	thought,	as	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 saying	 it	 out	 loud	 he	 could	 somehow	 cause	 it	 to	 happen.	 “No,	 she’s	 not,”	 I shot	back,	my	voice	shaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	 is,”	 he	 insisted,	 and	 right	 then	 I	 was	 glad	 that	 she	 was	 more	 or	 less comatose.	 At	 least	 that	 way	 she	 couldn’t	 possibly	 hear	 what	 we	 were	 saying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	I	was	over	at	Lori’s	house,	we	were	on	the	computer,	trying	to	get	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">information.	A	lot	of	the	sites	we	went	to	were	down,	but	we	found	one	with	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">guy	on	video	saying	that	everyone	who	catches	it	dies,	and	that	the	government</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	shutting	down	anyone	who	tries	to	spread	the	truth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 recalled	 that	 one	 blonde	 newscaster,	 and	 the	 way	 her	 gaze	 kept	 flickering nervously	to	something	—	or	someone	—	off-screen.	FBI…or	CIA…or	NSA…</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>agents,	standing	there	and	watching	to	make	sure	the	reporters	all	said	the	same thing? </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	any	other	time,	that	would	have	felt	like	rank	paranoia.	Now,	though…. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 crazy,”	 I	 said,	 although	 I	 didn’t	 sound	 all	 that	 convinced,	 even	 to myself.	“No	disease	is	one	hundred	percent	fatal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 we	 know	 of,”	 Devin	 shot	 back.	 Then	 his	 face	 twisted	 as	 he	 looked back	 down	 at	 our	 mother,	 at	 her	 strangely	 waxy	 and	 sunken	 features.	 “Is	 there anything	else	we	can	do?	Like,	I	don’t	know,	ice	packs	or	something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe,”	 I	 said.	 It	 was	 worth	 a	 try.	 Covering	 her	 in	 ice	 packs	 would</p>
<p class="calibre1">complete	the	ruin	of	her	outfit,	but	I	doubted	that	mattered	much	at	the	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Glad	to	have	something	to	do,	Devin	and	I	went	to	the	kitchen	and	got	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	big	gallon-sized	plastic	storage	bags	and	started	filling	them	with	ice.	That seriously	 depleted	 our	 current	 ice	 supply,	 but	 I	 knew	 the	 ice-maker	 would	 start chugging	away	in	an	attempt	to	make	up	the	deficit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	are	you	feeling?”	I	asked	as	we	zipped	up	the	last	bag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,”	he	said.	“I	mean,	I	feel…weird…but	I	don’t	feel	sick.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	about	sized	it	up.	Weird,	but	not	sick.	The	world	was	tilting	beneath	us, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	neither	of	us	knew	what	to	do	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	set	the	bags	I	carried	down	on	the	coffee	table,	not	worried	about	whether</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	cold	and	the	moisture	would	mar	the	wooden	surface.	Such	concerns	seemed</p>
<p class="calibre1">miles	 away	 from	 where	 we	 were	 right	 now.	 “I	 want	 to	 check	 her	 temperature again	 first,”	 I	 told	 Devin,	 picking	 up	 the	 thermometer	 and	 slipping	 it	 into	 our mother’s	 mouth.	 She	 squirmed	 a	 bit,	 but	 I	 held	 firm,	 and	 she	 subsided.	 We waited	as	the	seconds	went	by,	and	when	the	thermometer	beeped,	I	was	pulling</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	out	before	it	was	even	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	looked	at	the	readout,	I	couldn’t	believe	what	it	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	hundred	and	seven	point	two,”	I	read	as	my	stomach	began	to	knot.	So</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	for	the	ibuprofen	and	the	cold	towels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Devin’s	dark	eyes	were	practically	round,	they	widened	so	much.	“That’s	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible…is	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	it’s	possible	to	have	a	fever	that	high,”	I	replied,	then	stopped	there.	It wouldn’t	 do	 much	 good	 to	 point	 out	 that	 such	 an	 unnaturally	 high	 fever	 could result	in	brain	and	organ	damage…and	that	there	wasn’t	a	damn	thing	we	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	to	stop	it,	apparently.	I	drew	in	a	breath	and	added,	“Let’s	get	the	ice	on	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obviously,	the	cold	compresses	weren’t	enough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	nodded,	and	I	picked	up	the	bags	full	of	ice	I’d	placed	on	the	coffee	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 wasn’t	 even	 sure	 of	 the	 best	 positioning	 of	 the	 ice	 packs,	 but	 I	 figured	 she’d need	one	on	her	head,	and	some	up	against	her	sides,	maybe	on	her	chest…. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bag	in	my	left	hand	went	on	her	forehead,	and	the	one	in	my	right	down</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>on	her	chest.	She	winced,	although	her	eyes	didn’t	open.	The	bag	I’d	put	on	her chest	 shifted	 slightly,	 and	 I	 repositioned	 it.	 “Give	 me	 yours,”	 I	 told	 Devin, guessing	that	he	wouldn’t	feel	very	comfortable	about	setting	bags	full	of	ice	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 mother’s	 body.	 From	 the	 alacrity	 with	 which	 he	 handed	 them	 off,	 I	 had	 a feeling	 my	 guess	 was	 correct.	 I	 placed	 those	 two	 on	 either	 side	 of	 her	 waist, trying	to	position	them	in	such	a	way	that	they’d	get	maximum	contact	with	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">torso.	It	was	the	core	that	needed	to	get	cooled	down.	Or	at	least,	I	thought	that was	how	it	worked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	like	it,	I	could	tell	—	she	kept	shifting	slightly,	trying	to	get	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	cold,	but	she	was	so	weak	that	her	movements	were	ineffectual.	Still,	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	moved	around	much	more	than	that,	I’d	have	to	find	some	way	to	secure	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ice	packs	in	place.	There	had	to	be	some	rope	or	twine	or	something	like	that	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	garage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wondered	if	I	should	send	Devin	out	to	fetch	it.	He	was	staring	down	at	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother,	glassy-eyed,	as	if	not	quite	able	to	take	in	what	was	happening	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 I	 saw	 the	 way	 he	 swayed	 on	 his	 feet,	 and	 a	 wave	 of	 cold	 that	 had nothing	to	do	with	the	ice	packs	I’d	just	handled	washed	over	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Devin?”	I	asked,	and	it	seemed	it	took	him	far	longer	than	it	should	for	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	glance	over	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 pupils	 appeared	 to	 have	 dilated	 until	 they	 were	 so	 large	 that	 the	 black almost	swallowed	up	the	warm	brown	of	his	irises.	“Huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	 do	 you	 feel?”	 I	 enunciated	 the	 words	 carefully	 so	 there	 would	 be	 no chance	for	him	to	misunderstand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um…weird.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	to	him	and	put	my	hand	on	his	forehead.	He	didn’t	flinch	away,	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">told	me	something	was	very	wrong.	Actually,	the	clammy	heat	against	my	palm</p>
<p class="calibre1">told	me	everything	I	needed	to	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 I	 spoke,	 the	 words	 sounded	 as	 if	 they	 were	 coming	 from	 very	 far</p>
<p class="calibre1">away,	as	if	someone	other	than	myself	was	saying	them.	“Devin,	why	don’t	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">go	upstairs	and	get	into	bed?	I’ll	bet	you’re	tired.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	 I	 am	 kind	 of	 tired,”	 he	 mumbled,	 then	 turned	 with	 excruciating</p>
<p class="calibre1">slowness	and	began	moving	toward	the	hallway	and	the	staircase	that	led	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">second	floor.	I	prayed	he’d	be	able	to	get	there	under	his	own	power.	My	mother</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	been	difficult	enough	to	move.	I	knew	there	was	no	way	I’d	be	able	to	haul</p>
<p class="calibre1">170	pounds	of	running	back	up	those	stairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	somehow	he	did	it,	putting	one	foot	hesitatingly	after	the	other,	until	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">last	he	reached	the	upstairs	hall	and	stumbled	into	his	room.	I	followed,	giving</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	his	space,	and	when	he	collapsed	onto	his	bed,	legs	hanging	off	the	side,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted	to	let	out	a	sigh	of	relief…but	I	didn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>How	 could	 I,	 when	 I	 knew	 my	 brother	 had	 just	 been	 handed	 a	 death sentence? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a><img src="index-31_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="index-31_2.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">THREE</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	did	go	in,	and	untie	his	shoes	and	pull	them	off.	Then	I	waited	as	he	wriggled</p>
<p class="calibre1">under	the	covers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	some	rest,	Devin,”	I	told	him,	and	he	gave	me	a	bleary	nod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“’Kay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	he	slept	after	that,	or	just	plain	passed	out.	Part	of	me	was	thinking	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">should	 go	 downstairs	 and	 fetch	 the	 big	 bottle	 of	 ibuprofen,	 but	 what	 was	 the point?	I’d	given	some	to	my	mother,	and	it	hadn’t	made	a	whit	of	a	difference.	In</p>
<p class="calibre1">fact,	she’d	only	gotten	worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 couldn’t	 linger	 here,	 anyway	 —	 I	 had	 to	 go	 check	 on	 her.	 Devin	 seemed more	or	less	quiescent	for	the	moment,	so	it	seemed	safe	to	go	back	downstairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	hadn’t	moved	much.	The	ice	packs	were	more	or	less	in	place,	except	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	one	on	her	forehead,	which	had	slid	to	one	side.	I	put	it	back	in	the	proper</p>
<p class="calibre1">position,	 feeling	 as	 I	 did	 so	 how	 quickly	 the	 ice	 had	 melted,	 how	 half	 the	 bag was	now	just	cold	water.	Was	that	even	possible? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 again,	 I	 didn’t	 have	 much	 experience	 with	 how	 quickly	 a	 107-degree fever	could	melt	ice.	If	her	temperature	was	even	still	107.	It	might	have	gone	up again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Toward	 the	 front	 of	 the	 house,	 the	 door	 slammed,	 and	 I	 jumped.	 Then	 joy rushed	through	me	as	I	realized	who	it	must	be.	Thank	God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 ran	 out	 of	 the	 family	 room	 and	 into	 the	 hallway,	 saw	 my	 father	 coming</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>toward	me.	The	relief	that	spread	over	his	face	as	he	caught	sight	of	me	standing there,	 apparently	 safe	 and	 well,	 made	 me	 feel	 all	 warm	 and	 happy	 inside…for about	 a	 second.	 Then	 I	 thought	 of	 my	 mother,	 lying	 on	 the	 couch,	 silk	 shirt stained	 beyond	 recognition,	 eyes	 seeming	 to	 sink	 deeper	 and	 deeper	 into	 her head	 with	 every	 passing	 minute,	 of	 Devin	 passed	 out	 upstairs,	 the	 fever beginning	to	consume	him	as	well,	and	not	a	damn	thing	I	could	do	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	in	my	expression	must	have	changed,	because	my	father	stopped</p>
<p class="calibre1">dead	and	asked,	“Your	mother?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	in	the	family	room.	She	—	”	And	that’s	all	I	got	out,	because	out	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">nowhere	I	began	to	sob	noisily,	the	preternatural	calm	I’d	been	able	to	maintain</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	 day	 deserting	 me	 now	 that	 my	 father	 was	 here	 and	 I	 didn’t	 have	 to	 be	 the strong	one	anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 came	 to	 me	 and	 held	 me	 for	 a	 moment,	 letting	 me	 cry.	 No	 words	 of reassurance,	though;	I	had	a	feeling	he’d	seen	enough	today	to	know	there	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing	 remotely	 reassuring	 about	 our	 situation.	 Then	 he	 said,	 “I	 need	 to	 see her,”	and	let	go	of	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	protest.	I	was	his	daughter,	but	she	was	his	wife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 I	 paused	 in	 the	 doorway	 to	 the	 family	 room,	 I	 could	 see	 my	 father standing	a	few	feet	away	from	the	couch,	his	head	bowed.	His	hands	hung	at	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">sides,	clenched	into	fists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sorry,”	I	said	quietly.	“I	gave	her	some	ibuprofen,	but	that	didn’t	seem</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 work.	 Then	 I	 thought	 maybe	 the	 ice	 —	 ”	 I	 let	 the	 words	 break	 off	 there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing	was	working,	and	now	Devin	was	sick,	too,	and	right	then	I	didn’t	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	ability	to	pile	more	bad	news	on	my	father.	Not	with	that	non-expression	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 face,	 the	 one	 I’d	 seen	 a	 few	 times	 when	 he	 was	 desperately	 attempting	 to keep	the	world	from	knowing	how	badly	he	really	was	hurting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	didn’t	move.	At	first	I	wasn’t	sure	he	was	going	to	answer	me,	but	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	said,	“It’ll	slow	it	down,	but	it	won’t	stop	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	tone	was	so	final	that	I	couldn’t	help	asking,	“How	do	you	know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	one	of	those	short,	painful	silences.	“Because	I’ve	been	out	in	it	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">day.	 Seeing	 people	 collapse	 in	 the	 street.	 Taking	 others	 to	 the	 hospital	 in	 my cruiser	because	the	ambulances	were	either	busy	or	already	out	of	commission, </p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 drivers	 just	 as	 incapacitated	 as	 everyone	 else.	 Even	 Josh	 —	 ”	 His	 voice didn’t	exactly	break,	but	from	the	way	he	stopped	himself,	I	got	the	impression	it was	about	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Josh	was	my	father’s	partner.	They’d	been	partners	since,	well,	ever	since	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 remember.	 For	 my	 father	 to	 have	 seen	 the	 man	 he	 regarded	 as	 a	 brother come	down	with	this	terrible	thing….	“I’m	sorry,	Dad,”	I	said,	although	I	knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	words	were	completely	inadequate. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>“I	tried	to	take	him	to	the	hospital.	He	wouldn’t	go.	Said	he	was	going	to	die with	dignity	in	his	own	house.”	Again	I	heard	the	faintest	waver	at	the	edges	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 father’s	 voice	 before	 he	 got	 control	 of	 himself	 again.	 “I	 had	 to	 carry	 him inside.	He	was	already	burning	up.	And	after	that,	I	couldn’t	—	I	didn’t	see	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">point	in	staying	on	assignment	any	longer.	Half	the	force	was	already	sick	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	thing	and	the	rest	about	to	come	down	with	it.	I	knew	I	had	to	come	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Home,”	he	repeated,	staring	down	at	my	mother’s	limp	form. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 sorry,”	 I	 said	 again.	 Just	 words,	 but	 they	 did	 something	 to	 fill	 up	 the silence.	“She	seemed	okay	when	I	got	here.	But	then….”	I	bit	my	lip,	knowing	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	to	tell	him	about	Devin.	God,	I	didn’t	want	to,	though. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then?”	he	echoed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	collapsed.	I	brought	her	in	here	because	I	couldn’t	get	her	upstairs.	And</p>
<p class="calibre1">Devin….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	sick,	too.”	It	wasn’t	a	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	But	he’s	up	in	his	room.	He’s	sleeping.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	he’s	lucky.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wasn’t	sure	I	wanted	to	know	what	that	meant.	“So…what	do	we	do	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	 take	 your	 mother	 up	 to	 our	 bed.”	 For	 the	 first	 time,	 he	 shifted	 so	 he could	look	back	at	me.	“How	do	you	feel,	Jess?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,”	 I	 said,	 the	 automatic	 response.	 Then	 I	 shook	 my	 head,	 because	 I knew	that	was	a	lie,	and	I	didn’t	want	to	lie	to	my	father.	“No,	I	 <i class="calibre3">feel</i>	terrible.	But I’m	not	sick.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 understand.	 I	 feel	 the	 same	 way.”	 He	 turned	 toward	 my	 mother	 again, gently	 lifted	 the	 ice	 packs	 —	 which	 were	 now	 mostly	 water	 —	 from	 her,	 then slid	his	arms	under	her	so	he	could	pick	her	up.	Her	arms	and	legs	dangled,	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">limp	 as	 if	 they’d	 become	 somehow	 boneless,	 but	 she	 didn’t	 move,	 didn’t	 even make	a	whimper	of	protest.	Was	that	a	good	sign,	or	a	sign	that	she	was	slipping</p>
<p class="calibre1">farther	and	farther	away	from	us? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 crossed	 my	 arms	 and	 tried	 to	 suppress	 the	 shiver	 that	 went	 through	 me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	my	father’s	expression,	I	could	tell	he	wanted	to	be	alone	to	lay	her	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	bed	they	shared,	to	be	with	her	now	even	though	it	was	probably	too	late.	I understood	that,	and	yet	I	still	wanted	to	run	up	the	stairs	and	be	with	him,	to	not feel	so	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	stood	there,	letting	my	father	trudge	up	the	stairs	and	forcing	myself	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">stay	where	I	was,	to	give	him	his	privacy,	I	heard	something.	The	word	was	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 whisper	 at	 the	 edges	 of	 my	 mind,	 and	 yet	 it	 seemed	 to	 resonate	 along	 every nerve	ending. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Beloved…. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Going	 rigid,	 I	 held	 myself	 stock	 still,	 wondering	 where	 on	 earth	 that	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>come	 from.	 At	 first	 I	 thought	 it	 might	 have	 been	 my	 father,	 speaking	 to	 my mother,	 but	 I’d	 never	 heard	 him	 call	 her	 “beloved.”	 “Sweetheart,”	 yes,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">“darling”	 —	 but	 never	 “baby,”	 since	 she	 always	 said	 using	 that	 epithet	 only infantilized	women.	Such	a	firebrand,	my	mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although	maybe	that	was	the	wrong	word	to	be	using	right	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway,	their	bedroom	was	at	the	end	of	the	upstairs	hall,	too	far	away	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	to	have	heard	him	unless	he’d	all	but	shouted	the	word.	At	any	rate,	it	hadn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">sounded	like	my	father’s	voice.	It	was	somewhat	deep	like	his,	but	more	rounded</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	 the	 edges,	 with	 the	 faintest	 hint	 of	 an	 accent	 I	 couldn’t	 even	 begin	 to identify. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s	there?”	I	whispered,	feeling	like	an	idiot	even	as	the	words	left	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	reply,	of	course.	I	was	only	imagining	things.	No	one	had	ever	called	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">“beloved.”	Hell,	only	one	person	had	ever	even	told	me	he	loved	me.	Colin,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">boyfriend	 of	 my	 junior	 and	 senior	 years	 of	 college.	 It	 had	 taken	 me	 a	 while	 to realize	 his	 “love”	 wasn’t	 the	 kind	 I	 wanted	 —	 he	 said	 those	 things	 to	 keep	 me placated,	to	keep	me	from	noticing	that	he	was	banging	at	least	two	other	girls</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	 gone	 to	 the	 clinic	 right	 after	 I	 dumped	 him	 and	 had	 myself	 tested	 for every	disease	it	was	possible	to	be	tested	for,	and	I	was	fine,	but	that	experience had	scarred	me.	I	hadn’t	gotten	past	a	second	date	ever	since.	Third	dates	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	 things	 could	 start	 to	 get	 serious,	 when	 you	 might	 end	 up	 in	 the	 sack together.	So	I	always	made	sure	to	end	relationships	before	they	got	to	that	stage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	opportunities	for	anyone	to	be	calling	me	“beloved,”	that	was	for	sure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then	 I	 decided	 that	 the	 stress	 of	 the	 day	 had	 gotten	 to	 me,	 and	 I	 was hearing	 things.	 Or	 were	 auditory	 hallucinations	 another	 byproduct	 of	 a	 high fever?	I	didn’t	know	for	sure;	apparently,	I	hadn’t	spent	enough	time	hanging	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	WebMD. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	 though	 I	 knew	 it	 wouldn’t	 tell	 me	 anything	 concrete,	 I	 couldn’t	 help putting	my	hand	up	to	my	forehead.	No	discernible	change	in	temperature	that	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	tell,	which	meant	I	wasn’t	running	a	fever.	No	tingles	or	chills	or	any	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 other	 telltales	 of	 my	 internal	 temperature	 being	 anything	 other	 than	 what	 it should	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 decided	 that	 standing	 there	 and	 trying	 to	 determine	 whether	 I	 was	 sick	 or crazy	wasn’t	helping	anyone,	so	I	went	upstairs	to	check	on	Devin.	The	door	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	parents’	room	was	closed,	and	I	knew	better	than	to	knock.	My	father	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">come	out	when	he	was	ready.	I	couldn’t	begin	to	imagine	what	he’d	seen	today, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	knew	he	needed	this	time	alone	with	his	wife.	It	wasn’t	a	question	of	if,	but when;	the	human	body	just	couldn’t	survive	at	temperatures	like	that.	She	should</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>be	 in	 a	 hospital	 getting	 IV	 drips	 and	 ice	 baths	 and	 Lord	 knows	 what	 else.	 An economy-sized	 bottle	 of	 ibuprofen	 and	 some	 half-assed	 bags	 of	 ice	 from	 the freezer	weren’t	going	to	cut	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tears	began	to	prick	at	my	eyes,	and	I	blinked	them	away.	I’d	already	cried</p>
<p class="calibre1">once	 today,	 and	 I	 knew	 I’d	 probably	 have	 plenty	 more	 reasons	 to	 weep	 by	 the time	this	was	all	over.	Or	maybe	by	then	I’d	be	sick,	too,	and	I	wouldn’t	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	 was	 happening	 to	 me.	 That	 was	 one	 blessed	 thing	 about	 this	 entire nightmare	—	once	people	got	hit	by	that	fever,	it	scrambled	their	brains	so	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 didn’t	 seem	 to	 be	 aware	 of	 what	 was	 happening	 to	 them.	 Thank	 God	 for small	mercies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	opened	Devin’s	door	a	crack	and	saw	that	he	had	fallen	into	the	fitful	phase</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	disease	—	twitching	and	jerking,	his	forehead	sheened	with	sweat.	Even</p>
<p class="calibre1">though	I	knew	it	probably	wouldn’t	do	any	good,	I	went	to	the	upstairs	bathroom</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	shook	three	capsules	of	ibuprofen	out	of	the	big	bottle	in	the	cabinet	there, </p>
<p class="calibre1">then	pulled	a	little	paper	cup	from	the	dispenser	and	filled	it	with	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	 as	 I	 was	 approaching	 his	 bed,	 Devin’s	 leg	 jerked	 out	 and	 hit	 my	 arm, causing	 the	 water	 to	 splash	 all	 down	 my	 front,	 soaking	 the	 knit	 top	 I	 wore.	 I muttered	a	curse,	but	he	didn’t	even	seem	to	realize	what	he’d	done,	and	that	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">how	 I	 knew	 he	 must	 be	 completely	 out	 of	 it.	 At	 any	 other	 time,	 he	 would’ve burst	out	laughing	at	managing	to	kick	water	all	over	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pulling	 in	 a	 breath,	 I	 did	 an	 about-face	 and	 went	 back	 to	 the	 bathroom, plucked	 a	 towel	 off	 the	 rack,	 and	 did	 the	 best	 I	 could	 to	 blot	 the	 worst	 of	 the moisture	 from	 my	 shirt.	 Then	 I	 refilled	 the	 paper	 cup	 and	 went	 back	 to	 my brother’s	bedroom,	approaching	with	care	from	the	side	so	he	wouldn’t	catch	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">unawares	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	kick	seemed	to	have	consumed	the	last	of	his	strength,	because	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">lying	on	his	back,	one	arm	flopped	over	the	side	of	the	bed.	I	went	to	him	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">murmured,	“Here’s	some	medicine	for	you,	Dev.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	water	first,	since	that	had	worked	well	with	both	Taylor	and	my	mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	drank,	and	didn’t	protest	when	I	dropped	a	pill	on	his	tongue	and	made	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">swallow,	then	gave	him	some	more	water.	I	repeated	the	process	two	more	times, </p>
<p class="calibre1">giving	him	one	last	sip	to	empty	the	cup,	my	arm	under	his	head	to	steady	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	did	drink,	then	collapsed	against	the	pillow	when	he	was	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Was	any	of	that	going	to	do	him	any	good?	Or	was	I	just	doing	something…</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything…to	make	myself	feel	less	helpless? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Probably	the	latter,	although	I	wasn’t	quite	ready	to	admit	it	to	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	Devin	seemed	to	be	sleeping	again,	I	decided	I	could	leave	him	for	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bit.	Pulling	out	the	chair	and	sitting	next	to	him	felt	a	little	too	much	like	keeping watch	over	someone’s	deathbed,	and	I	wasn’t	ready	to	do	that	yet.	Also,	I’d	just</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>realized	I	was	thirsty,	too	—	I	hadn’t	had	anything	to	drink	since	I’d	come	home several	hours	earlier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 I	 slipped	 out	 of	 my	 brother’s	 room	 and	 went	 back	 down	 the	 stairs.	 The door	to	my	parents’	room	was	still	shut,	and	I	felt	a	completely	unworthy	stab	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">irritation.	 Yes,	 it	 must	 be	 terrible	 for	 my	 father,	 but	 I	 doubted	 my	 mother	 even knew	 he	 was	 there,	 whereas	 I	 needed	 him,	 needed	 someone	 to	 talk	 to.	 But	 I knew	 I	 would	 never	 disturb	 him,	 so	 I	 kept	 going	 to	 the	 kitchen.	 Once	 there,	 I pulled	a	glass	from	the	cupboard	and	held	it	up	to	the	ice	dispenser.	A	few	cubes</p>
<p class="calibre1">half-heartedly	 spilled	 out,	 and	 I	 guessed	 it	 was	 working	 overtime	 to	 replenish what	I’d	already	used	in	my	futile	attempt	to	reduce	my	mother’s	fever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 sat	 down	 on	 one	 of	 the	 stools	 at	 the	 breakfast	 bar	 and	 stared	 out	 the window,	 not	 really	 focusing	 on	 anything.	 Since	 our	 house	 was	 on	 a	 corner,	 the view	 included	 the	 low	 juniper	 hedges	 planted	 against	 the	 fence,	 and	 a	 fairly unobstructed	 glimpse	 of	 the	 street	 beyond.	 As	 I	 watched,	 a	 silver	 car	 wove	 its way	 down	 the	 street,	 listlessly	 drifting	 from	 one	 side	 of	 the	 narrow	 residential lane	to	the	other,	actually	hitting	one	curb	before	correcting	and	moving	toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	one	opposite,	like	the	world’s	biggest	and	slowest	pinball.	It	finally	came	to rest	halfway	up	on	the	sidewalk	on	the	corner	across	from	our	property,	almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">touching	the	smooth	green	lawn	Mr.	D’Ambrosio	took	such	pride	in,	when	most</p>
<p class="calibre1">everyone	 else	 in	 the	 neighborhood	 had	 long	 since	 given	 up	 on	 grass	 and	 had switched	over	to	cactus-	and	evergreen-studded	drought-tolerant	landscaping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	one	came	out	of	the	D’Ambrosio	house	to	check	on	the	driver,	which	told</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	 Mr.	 and	 Mrs.	 D’Ambrosio	 must	 be	 as	 incapacitated	 as	 whoever	 had	 been driving	 that	 Camry.	 In	 that	 moment,	 I	 was	 just	 glad	 the	 driver	 had	 only	 been going	 twenty	 miles	 an	 hour	 at	 the	 most.	 Anything	 else,	 and	 they	 could	 have caused	a	lot	more	damage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Footsteps	 coming	 down	 the	 hall	 made	 me	 turn,	 and	 I	 saw	 my	 father</p>
<p class="calibre1">approaching.	His	eyes	looked	red,	but	otherwise	his	face	was	still	and	calm,	as	if he’d	made	his	peace	with	whatever	was	happening	to	my	mother,	to	Devin…to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 words	 made	 their	 way	 to	 my	 lips	 before	 I	 even	 realized	 I	 was	 saying them.	“Is	she…?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.”	His	gaze	shifted	to	the	glass	of	water	sitting	on	the	counter	in	front	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">me,	and	he	gave	a	faint	nod.	He	went	and	got	his	own	glass	from	the	cupboard, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 got	 some	 water	 as	 well,	 although	 I	 noticed	 he	 didn’t	 bother	 with	 the	 ice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Afterward,	he	sat	down	next	to	me	on	one	of	the	barstools	and	added,	“Not	yet, </p>
<p class="calibre1">anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How…how	long?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don’t	 know.”	 He	 drank	 some	 water,	 and	 I	 decided	 I	 should	 as	 well, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>although	it	seemed	to	get	jammed	halfway	down	my	throat,	lodging	there	as	if	it was	a	solid	object	instead	of	liquid.	“It…varies,	from	what	I’ve	seen	and	heard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	know	why,	but	for	some	reason	that	bothered	me	almost	as	much	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything	else	that	had	happened	so	far.	If	a	disease	was	going	to	be	this	evil,	it should	at	least	be	predictable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 question	 had	 been	 torturing	 me	 all	 afternoon,	 and	 now	 I	 finally	 had someone	I	could	ask	it	of.	“Dad…why	isn’t	anyone	helping?	Why	are	we	being</p>
<p class="calibre1">left	to	deal	with	this	alone?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 long	 pause,	 during	 which	 he	 stared	 down	 at	 his	 glass	 of	 water	 without meeting	my	eyes.	When	he	did	look	up,	I	almost	wished	I	hadn’t	been	watching</p>
<p class="calibre1">him,	waiting	for	his	response.	Never	in	my	life	had	I	seen	such	an	expression	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">despair	on	my	father’s	face.	Despair…and	fury. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	there’s	no	one	 <i class="calibre3">to</i>	help,	Jess.	What’s	happening	here	in	Albuquerque</p>
<p class="calibre1">—	 it’s	 happening	 everywhere.	 New	 York.	 Los	 Angeles.	 Washington,	 D.C.	 and London	 and	 Moscow	 and	 —	 everywhere.”	 His	 hands,	 his	 big,	 strong,	 capable hands,	 now	 somehow	 looked	 limp	 and	 broken	 as	 they	 rested	 on	 the	 counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	no	answer	at	the	CDC.	Tried	calling	in	the	National	Guard	for	help,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing.	The	only	good	thing	about	the	whole	situation	is	that	people	are	getting</p>
<p class="calibre1">sick	so	quickly,	they	don’t	have	time	to	get	into	trouble.	The	fever	makes	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">incapable	of	violence,	of	looting.	Most	collapse	where	they	stand.	That’s	why	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	that	Devin	was	lucky	—	you	got	him	into	bed,	and	he’s	sleeping.	The	fever</p>
<p class="calibre1">doesn’t	 have	 him	 hallucinating	 and	 having	 convulsions	 or	 seizures,	 like	 I	 saw happen	with	some	people	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So…that’s	it?”	I	whispered.	“We	all	just	sit	back	and	wait	to	die?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 scrubbed	 his	 hand	 over	 his	 face	 and	 glanced	 away	 from	 me.	 “I	 don’t know.	 There’s	 no	 way	 to	 treat	 this	 thing.	 Either	 you	 get	 it,	 or	 you	 don’t.	 Or rather,	I	have	yet	to	see	anyone	who	hasn’t	caught	it,	but…you’re	not	sick.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yet,”	I	said	flatly,	then	drank	some	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Usually,	you’d	be	sick	by	now,	since	you’ve	been	around	infected	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	not	sick,	either,”	I	pointed	out,	and	he	gave	a	grim	nod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 keep	 expecting	 to	 be,	 but….”	 Deliberately,	 he	 picked	 up	 his	 glass	 and drained	 the	 water.	 “I	 don’t	 know.	 It’s	 possible	 we	 could	 have	 a	 hereditary immunity.	I	just	don’t	know.”	His	fingers	tightened	on	the	glass,	and	for	a	second I	 thought	 he	 was	 going	 to	 pick	 it	 up	 and	 hurl	 it	 at	 the	 wall,	 do	 something	 to express	the	frustrated	anger	I	saw	in	his	eyes.	Instead,	he	let	go	of	it	and	pushed it	away.	“The	problem	is,	I	don’t	know	anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither	 did	 I,	 except	 that	 I	 didn’t	 feel	 sick,	 and	 my	 father	 didn’t	 appear	 to have	any	symptoms,	either.	Maybe	there	really	was	something	to	that	notion	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">hereditary	immunity.	In	looks	and	build,	I	favored	my	mother,	with	my	almost-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>black	hair	and	dark	eyes,	traits	she	claimed	came	from	a	great-great-grandmother who	 was	 full-blood	 Ute,	 while	 Devin	 and	 my	 father	 were	 more	 alike,	 hair	 still dark	 but	 not	 as	 inky	 as	 mine,	 their	 eyes	 a	 lighter,	 warmer	 brown.	 So	 why	 my father	 and	 I	 were	 the	 ones	 with	 no	 symptoms,	 I	 couldn’t	 begin	 to	 guess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obviously,	 appearance	 didn’t	 have	 much	 to	 do	 with	 this	 particular	 quirk	 of heredity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	anything,	either,”	I	said.	“But	I	guess	I’ll	start	with	checking</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	Devin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 I’ll	 look	 in	 on	 your	 mother.”	 My	 father	 got	 up	 from	 his	 stool,	 and	 I followed	suit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	I	was	upstairs,	I	could	tell	there	hadn’t	been	any	real	change	with	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">brother.	 He	 didn’t	 even	 seem	 to	 have	 moved,	 but	 still	 lay	 there	 with	 one	 arm flopped	over	the	side	of	his	bed,	eyes	tightly	shut.	In	fact,	he	was	so	still	that	I went	over	and	laid	two	fingers	against	his	throat,	worried	that	I	wouldn’t	feel	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">pulse.	It	was	there,	but	thready	and	fast,	which	couldn’t	be	a	good	sign.	His	hair, cropped	short	for	football	season,	was	damp	with	sweat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	about	that	thought,	the	realization	that	he	should	be	off	at	football</p>
<p class="calibre1">practice	 right	 now	 instead	 of	 lying	 here,	 fighting	 a	 disease	 so	 mysterious	 and strange	 that	 it	 didn’t	 even	 have	 a	 formal	 name,	 made	 the	 anger	 rise	 up	 in	 me again.	 This	 shouldn’t	 be	 happening.	 He	 should	 be	 with	 his	 teammates,	 getting sweaty	 because	 his	 coach	 had	 made	 him	 do	 a	 hundred	 push-ups	 for	 being	 a smart-ass	yet	again.	And	an	hour	from	now,	we	should	all	be	sitting	down	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dinner	table	together,	something	families	hardly	ever	did	anymore,	but	which	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother	 insisted	 on.	 I’d	 been	 skipping	 those	 meals	 on	 Tuesdays	 and	 Thursdays, since	I	had	to	teach	a	six	o’clock	class,	but	I	tried	to	make	it	when	I	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">None	 of	 that	 was	 happening,	 though.	 And	 it	 wasn’t	 happening	 for	 Devin’s girlfriend	Lori,	or	my	own	friends	Elena	and	Tori	and	Brittany,	or	—	or	 <i class="calibre3">anyone</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	across	the	city…the	country…the	world…people	were	suffering	and	dying, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	no	one	could	stop	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 realization	 made	 the	 enormity	 of	 the	 whole	 situation	 come	 crashing</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	 on	 me.	 I	 let	 out	 a	 choked	 little	 sob	 and	 fled	 my	 brother’s	 room,	 running down	 the	 stairs	 to	 the	 family	 room	 so	 I	 could	 turn	 on	 the	 TV,	 could	 reassure myself	 with	 the	 sound	 of	 someone	 else’s	 voice,	 even	 if	 the	 newscasters	 were following	the	commands	of	people	who	might	already	be	dead.	I	had	to	know	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">world	 still	 existed	 out	 there	 beyond	 my	 house,	 even	 if	 it	 was	 a	 world	 swiftly falling	apart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	when	I	picked	up	the	remote	and	turned	on	the	television,	nothing	came</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 to	 reassure	 me.	 Some	 stations	 blank,	 others	 showing	 a	 “please	 stand	 by” </p>
<p class="calibre1">message,	 others	 with	 a	 test	 pattern	 of	 colored	 bars.	 My	 heart	 rate	 sped	 up	 as	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>moved	 from	 channel	 to	 channel,	 thinking	 that	 there	 had	 to	 be	 at	 least	 one	 still broadcasting,	one	that	hadn’t	been	abandoned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">AMC	seemed	to	be	showing	a	rerun	of	 <i class="calibre3">The	Walking	Dead</i>,	which	had	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone’s	 idea	 of	 a	 sick	 joke,	 as	 I	 didn’t	 think	 that	 show	 ever	 ran	 before	 nine o’clock	at	night	due	to	its	content.	And	that	wasn’t	even	the	worst.	Farther	up	the band,	on	a	channel	I	didn’t	recognize,	the	screen	was	black,	with	words	in	stark</p>
<p class="calibre1">white	emblazoned	across	it:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">And	I	beheld	when	he	had	opened	the	sixth	seal,	and,	lo,	there	was	a	great</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">earthquake;	 and	 the	 sun	 became	 black	 as	 sackcloth	 of	 hair,	 and	 the	 moon</i> <i class="calibre3">became	as	blood…. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 wasn’t	 much	 of	 a	 Bible	 reader,	 but	 even	 I	 recognized	 the	 quote	 from Revelations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Making	a	disgusted	sound,	I	clicked	off	the	TV,	then	turned	when	I	heard	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">father	come	to	the	door	and	lean	against	the	frame,	his	shoulders	slumped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	the	end	of	the	world,”	he	said	softly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	couldn’t	be	my	father	—	my	hard-nosed,	practical	father,	the	one	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	sure	I	knew	how	to	shoot,	how	to	catch	a	fish	and	clean	it,	how	to	change</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	oil	in	my	car	and	swap	out	a	flat	tire.	Nothing	ever	fazed	him.	But	now	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">underlying	 steel	 seemed	 to	 have	 given	 way,	 his	 firm	 jaw	 somehow	 loose,	 his eyes	blurred	with	sorrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dad?”	I	said	uncertainly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	gone,”	he	told	me,	voice	flat.	“While	we	were	down	in	the	kitchen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 words	 didn’t	 seem	 to	 make	 any	 sense.	 Or	 rather,	 my	 mind	 refused	 to make	 sense	 of	 them,	 because	 if	 I	 understood	 those	 words,	 I’d	 know	 in	 that moment	my	mother	was	dead,	and	I	just	couldn’t	face	that.	Not	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 the	 longest	 moment,	 I	 didn’t	 say	 anything,	 only	 stared	 up	 at	 him	 as	 I turned	the	remote	I	held	over	and	over	in	my	hand,	its	familiar	rectangular	shape</p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly	alien,	cold	and	hard.	Not	wanting	to	hold	it	any	longer,	I	set	it	down	on the	coffee	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	I	said	at	last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	 he	 said	 softly.	 “It	 doesn’t	 look	 like	 she	 suffered.	 At	 least,	 not	 like some	that	I’ve	seen.	You’d	almost	think	she	was	asleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	she	is	asleep,”	I	protested.	“Maybe	you	just	thought	—	just	thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	was	—	”	I	couldn’t	say	the	word.	Not	in	connection	with	my	mother.	If	I	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">it,	then	it	would	be	true,	and	I	couldn’t	bear	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 didn’t	 bother	 to	 contradict	 me,	 only	 watched	 me.	 Something	 of	 the	 no-nonsense	father	I	was	used	to	was	clear	in	those	eyes.	They	said,  <i class="calibre3">I	don’t	want	to</i> <i class="calibre3">believe	it,	either.	But	that	doesn’t	make	it	less	true. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 hard	 knot	 was	 back	 in	 my	 throat.	 My	 eyes	 burned.	 For	 some	 reason, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>though,	the	tears	wouldn’t	fall.	They	just	remained	where	they	were,	burning	like acid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	I	asked,	“What	should	we	do?	Should	we	—	”	I	couldn’t	even	finish</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	question.	This	would	have	been	bad	enough	under	normal	circumstances,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 least	 then	 there	 was	 a	 routine	 to	 follow.	 You	 called	 the	 doctor.	 The	 doctor called	the	ambulance,	and	then	eventually	someone	got	in	touch	with	the	funeral</p>
<p class="calibre1">home.	That	was	how	it	worked	when	Grandmother	Ivy	—	my	mom’s	mother	—</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	passed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,	 though…now	 you	 couldn’t	 even	 get	 a	 call	 through.	 And	 if	 by	 some</p>
<p class="calibre1">miracle	 you	 did,	 it	 wouldn’t	 matter,	 because	 there	 wouldn’t	 be	 anyone	 on	 the other	end	to	answer	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	wouldn’t	meet	my	eyes.	“We	don’t	need	to	do	anything,”	he	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that	scary	monotone	back	in	his	voice.	“It’ll	take	care	of	itself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 something	 in	 the	 way	 he	 said	 those	 words	 made	 me	 too	 frightened	 to ask	what	in	the	world	he	meant. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a><img src="index-41_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="index-41_2.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">FOUR</p>
<p class="calibre1">He	went	into	the	kitchen	after	that.	I	didn’t	follow,	but	instead	just	stood	there	in the	 family	 room,	 my	 entire	 body	 feeling	 as	 if	 it	 had	 been	 encased	 in	 ice.	 One thought	kept	hammering	away	in	my	head,	over	and	over	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">She’s	dead.	She’s	dead.	Your	mother	is	dead. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wished	I	could	cry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	the	kitchen,	I	heard	the	clunk	of	ice	dropping	from	the	dispenser,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sound	of	liquid	pouring,	although	not	from	the	refrigerator	door.	I	had	a	sinking</p>
<p class="calibre1">feeling	I	knew	exactly	what	it	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	was	not,	unlike	a	lot	of	cops,	a	heavy	drinker.	He	and	my	mother</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 have	 a	 glass	 of	 wine	 with	 dinner	 sometimes,	 and	 I’d	 seen	 him	 drink champagne	at	weddings	and	have	a	beer	after	a	morning	of	washing	both	his	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom’s	cars,	but	that	was	about	it.	But	there	was	a	bottle	of	Scotch	he	kept	high</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	on	a	shelf,	a	bottle	that	rarely	made	an	appearance.	One	time	when	his	partner</p>
<p class="calibre1">Josh	was	shot	in	the	leg	while	breaking	up	a	domestic	dispute.	Or	the	time	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother	found	a	lump	in	her	breast	and	had	to	go	in	for	a	biopsy.	It	turned	out	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	nothing,	a	benign	cyst,	but	we’d	all	been	fearing	the	worst. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 now	 the	 worst	 had	 happened,	 although	 in	 a	 manner	 none	 of	 us	 could have	 imagined,	 and	 he	 was	 sitting	 at	 the	 breakfast	 bar	 in	 the	 kitchen,	 drinking Scotch	on	the	rocks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 I	 was	 too	 scared	 and	 shocked	 to	 even	 give	 him	 shit	 about	 it.	 If	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>wanted	 to	 seek	 comfort	 in	 a	 glass	 of	 Scotch	 rather	 than	 in	 me,	 there	 wasn’t anything	I	could	do	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still	 with	 that	 horrible	 lump	 lodged	 firmly	 in	 my	 throat,	 I	 went	 back	 to	 the staircase	and	slowly	went	up	it,	each	step	more	and	more	difficult,	as	if	I	were	in some	horrible	alternate	dimension	that	kept	strengthening	the	gravity	pulling	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	with	every	movement.	Finally,	though,	I	made	it	up	to	the	landing,	then	went</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	Devin’s	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 had	 shifted	 and	 was	 now	 lying	 on	 his	 side,	 half	 his	 covers	 thrown	 off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’d	probably	felt	far	too	hot,	but	I	knew	he	had	to	stay	warm.	I	crossed	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">room	 and	 grasped	 the	 sheet	 and	 blanket,	 hesitating	 as	 my	 hand	 paused	 on	 the comforter.	Maybe	that	really	was	a	bit	too	much,	since	it	had	been	a	mild,	warm</p>
<p class="calibre1">day,	 and	 his	 room	 wasn’t	 anywhere	 close	 to	 cold	 yet.	 I	 could	 always	 put	 the comforter	over	him	later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 I	 began	 to	 settle	 the	 sheet	 over	 his	 shoulders,	 though,	 something	 felt wrong.	At	first	I	couldn’t	quite	figure	it	out,	and	then,	even	as	I	realized	what	the problem	was,	my	mind	didn’t	want	to	acknowledge	it.	Not	this.	Not	so	soon	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">—	well,	after. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 last	 time	 I’d	 been	 this	 close	 to	 him,	 heat	 had	 fairly	 radiated	 from	 his flesh.	Now,	though,	he	felt	cool,	and	when	I	reached	down	to	touch	his	hand,	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">fingers	 were	 like	 ice,	 and	 somehow	 already	 stiff,	 although	 logically	 I	 knew	 it was	far	too	early	for	rigor	mortis	to	have	set	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	again,	what	was	logical	about	any	of	this? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	recoiled,	letting	go	of	my	dead	brother’s	hand,	and	backed	away	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bed.	 As	 my	 father	 had	 told	 me	 about	 my	 mother’s	 passing,	 Devin	 didn’t	 look dead,	 just	 asleep.	 For	 whatever	 reason,	 his	 face	 didn’t	 have	 that	 sunken	 look about	it	that	my	mother	had	worn.	Maybe	his	fever	hadn’t	burned	as	hot? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	that	it	mattered,	because	he	was	gone,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	frightened	little	sob	tore	its	way	out	of	my	throat,	and	I	continued	to	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">away,	 creeping	 out	 into	 the	 hallway	 and	 shutting	 the	 door	 behind	 me.	 I	 knew	 I should	go	downstairs	and	tell	my	father	what	had	happened,	but	for	some	reason</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	feet	took	me	in	the	opposite	direction,	toward	my	parents’	bedroom.	Before	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">even	 knew	 what	 I	 was	 doing,	 my	 hand	 seemed	 to	 have	 reached	 out	 of	 its	 own accord	 and	 was	 turning	 the	 knob.	 I’d	 just	 seen	 death.	 I	 needed	 to	 see	 my mother’s,	 too,	 so	 it	 would	 be	 just	 as	 real.	 Maybe	 then	 my	 brain	 would	 be shocked	out	of	its	current	numb	state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sun	was	beginning	to	set,	but	my	parents’	bedroom	had	a	window	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">western	wall,	so	a	warm,	mellow	light	was	flooding	the	space.	It	was	certainly</p>
<p class="calibre1">bright	enough	for	me	to	see	where	my	mother’s	body	should	be	lying,	propped</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	against	the	pillows	on	her	side	of	the	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>Only…she	wasn’t	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 first	 thought	 was	 that	 my	 father	 must	 have	 moved	 her,	 but	 why	 in	 the world	would	he	have	done	that?	Besides,	there	wasn’t	anyplace	he	really	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	moved	her,	not	unless	he	put	her	in	the	bathtub	for	some	reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	second	thought,	that	notion	wasn’t	so	strange.	He	could’ve	put	her	in	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">ice-cold	bath	in	an	attempt	to	bring	her	temperature	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rushed	into	the	 <i class="calibre3">en	suite</i>	bathroom,	but	the	tub	was	empty.	As	I	stared	down at	it,	I	realized	that	was	a	ridiculous	notion.	Even	if	my	father	had	put	her	in	the bath,	I	would	have	heard	the	water	running,	and	I’d	heard	no	such	thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thoughts	racing,	first	rejecting	one	idea,	and	then	another,	I	returned	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bedroom.	From	this	angle,	I	could	now	see	a	pile	of	fine	gray	dust	marring	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">surface	of	the	blue	and	tan	striped	comforter,	the	one	my	father	had	permitted	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	room	only	because	“it	wasn’t	too	girly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dust?	My	mother	would	never	allow	dust	to	collect	on	the	furniture,	let	alone</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	pile	like	that	right	on	the	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cold	 coiled	 in	 the	 pit	 of	 my	 stomach	 as	 I	 stared	 down	 at	 the	 strange	 little pile.	 On	 a	 dare	 from	 Devin,	 I’d	 once	 peeked	 inside	 the	 urn	 containing	 my grandmother’s	ashes…and	they	had	been	almost	the	exact	color	and	consistency</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	the	ashes	now	sitting	on	my	parents’	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No,	that	was	impossible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	my	father’s	words	came	back	to	me:	 <i class="calibre3">It’ll	take	care	of	itself. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Was	 this	 what	 he’d	 meant?	 That	 somehow	 after	 she	 passed,	 my	 mother</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	simply	crumble	into	a	pile	of	dust? </p>
<p class="calibre1">No,	I	refused	to	believe	that.	There	had	to	be	an	explanation.	Otherwise…. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Otherwise,	this	whole	situation	had	moved	from	the	unexplainable	and	tragic</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 positively	 Biblical.	 Whoever	 heard	 of	 bodies	 turning	 themselves	 to	 ash, unless	it	was	by	some	strange	otherworldly	force? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	see,”	my	father	said.	He	must	have	come	upstairs	while	I	was	standing</p>
<p class="calibre1">there,	staring	down	at	my	mother	in	shock.	His	speech	sounded	a	little	slurred, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	at	least	he	hadn’t	brought	the	glass	of	Scotch	up	with	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	—	what	happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 what	 happens	 to	 all	 of	 them,”	 he	 replied.	 “Usually	 within	 an	 hour	 of death.”	 Rubbing	 at	 his	 brow,	 he	 added,	 “Very	 clean,	 when	 you	 think	 about	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Much	better	than	having	all	those	bodies	lying	around,	don’t	you	think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stared	at	him	in	horror.	“That’s	Mom	lying	there!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	he	corrected	me.	“That’s	what	used	to	be	your	mother.	The	part	of	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 was	 really	  <i class="calibre3">her</i>	 —	 that’s	 gone.	 To	 a	 better	 place,	 I	 have	 to	 hope,	 but	 after everything	I’ve	seen	today,	I’m	beginning	to	have	my	doubts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	voice	was	sad,	but	resigned.	And	as	I	looked	at	him,	I	noticed	the	way	he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>wasn’t	completely	steady	on	his	feet,	the	glisten	of	sweat	on	his	forehead	from the	 last	 rays	 of	 sun	 coming	 in	 through	 the	 window.	 Maybe	 my	 mind	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">registered	 them	 earlier,	 but	 had	 dismissed	 them	 as	 effects	 of	 the	 alcohol.	 Now, though…. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">No</i>.	 Even	 as	 my	 mind	 recoiled	 from	 the	 thought,	 I	 found	 myself	 asking, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dad,	are	you	sick?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 gave	 me	 a	 sad	 smile.	 “I	 think	 I	 am.	 Finally	 caught	 up	 with	 me,	 I suppose.”	His	gaze	moved	to	the	bed.	“I	should	probably	lie	down,	but….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	 to	 the	 guest	 room,”	 I	 said.	 It	 used	 to	 be	 my	 room,	 but	 my	 parents	 had refitted	it	as	a	spare	bedroom	just	the	past	year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	so,”	he	replied.	“I	want	to	die	in	here,	next	to	where	she	slept.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	—	”	I	didn’t	have	the	strength	to	mention	the	ashes,	all	that	remained	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	mother,	but	from	the	way	my	father	was	staring	at	them,	he	knew	all	too	well</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	I	was	thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	her	vase,”	he	told	me.	“The	Waterford	one	I	bought	her	for	her	fiftieth</p>
<p class="calibre1">birthday.	She’d	like	that,	I	think.”	He	reached	out	and	grasped	the	doorframe,	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	that	was	the	only	thing	holding	him	up	right	then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wanted	to	protest,	but	I	knew	that	wouldn’t	do	any	good.	Besides,	I	didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">know	 how	 much	 time	 I	 had	 until	 he	 fell	 over	 right	 there	 in	 the	 doorway.	 My mother’s	collapse	had	been	sudden	and	shocking,	and	Devin’s	not	much	better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 I	 nodded	 and	 pushed	 past	 him	 to	 run	 down	 the	 stairs	 and	 go	 into	 the	 living room,	where	the	vase	in	question	stood	on	one	of	the	end	tables. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	grabbing	it,	I	hurried	back	up	to	my	parents’	bedroom,	where	my	father</p>
<p class="calibre1">—	 through	 sheer	 force	 of	 will,	 probably	 —	 was	 still	 hanging	 on	 to	 the doorframe.	I	showed	him	the	vase	but	didn’t	stop,	instead	going	to	the	bed	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">grasping	the	comforter,	then	tilting	it	so	the	gray	dust	would	tip	into	the	crystal container.	 During	 this	 operation,	 I	 didn’t	 dare	 breathe,	 but	 the	 dust	 was surprisingly	 heavy	 and	 didn’t	 puff	 up	 into	 the	 air	 the	 way	 I	 feared	 it	 might. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead,	 it	 slipped	 down	 into	 the	 vase,	 filling	 it	 approximately	 halfway.	 Not letting	 myself	 think	 about	 what	 it	 held,	 I	 took	 it	 over	 to	 the	 dresser	 and	 set	 it down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	there	was	no	way	I	would	put	that	comforter	back	where	it	had	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">from,	I	folded	it	in	on	itself	to	trap	any	remaining	dust,	and	set	it	on	the	floor	at the	foot	of	the	bed.	“Okay,”	I	said,	my	voice	shaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 father	 didn’t	 seem	 to	 notice	 the	 tremor	 in	 that	 one	 little	 word,	 but	 only pushed	himself	off	from	the	doorframe	and	then	staggered	over	to	the	bed.	After</p>
<p class="calibre1">pausing	 to	 kick	 off	 his	 shoes	 and	 remove	 his	 belt,	 complete	 with	 holsters	 and badge,	he	fell	down	onto	the	mattress.	That	seemed	to	have	taken	the	last	of	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">strength,	because	his	head	fell	back	against	the	pillow	at	once,	and	his	eyes	shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>Incongruously,	 I	 noted	 how	 heavy	 and	 thick	 his	 lashes	 were,	 lying	 against	 his flushed	cheeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dad?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 lifted	 one	 hand.	 “Just	 tired.	 I	 took	 some	 ibuprofen	 on	 the	 way	 up.	 Not going	to	do	any	good,	but	I	didn’t	want	you	to	have	to	get	it	for	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	heart	was	breaking.	I	could	feel	it…literally	feel	it.	One	piece	torn	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	my	mother,	the	next	for	Devin.	And	when	my	father	went,	did	that	mean	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart	would	finally	shatter	once	and	for	all,	gone	to	dust	like	everyone	else	in	the world? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cramming	my	fist	into	my	mouth	to	push	back	another	one	of	those	ragged</p>
<p class="calibre1">sobs,	 I	 went	 out	 to	 the	 hallway	 and	 staggered	 over	 to	 the	 carved	 wooden balustrade	on	the	landing.	I	wrapped	my	fingers	around	the	rail	and	hung	on	as	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	my	life.	No	fever	scorched	its	way	through	me,	but	I	felt	as	weak	as	though</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	temperature	was	110	degrees. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Beloved,	it	will	all	be	over	soon. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 voice	 again.	 It	 had	 to	 be	 a	 hallucination,	 some	 strange	 coping</p>
<p class="calibre1">mechanism	my	brain	had	cooked	up,	but	still	I	found	myself	replying	out	loud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does	that	mean	I’m	sick	and	will	soon	be	dead	along	with	everyone	else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">No.	That	is	not	your	fate. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	my	fate?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence.	Apparently	my	subconscious	or	whatever	it	was	that	had	created	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">soft,	 reassuring	 baritone	 didn’t	 quite	 have	 the	 balls	 to	 tell	 me	 what	 my	 future held.	Not	that	you	needed	to	be	a	fortune-teller	for	that.	Raging	fever,	and	a	pile of	dust	somewhere.	Should	I	go	out	on	the	family	room	couch,	or	hike	my	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	 up	 to	 my	 apartment	 when	 the	 time	 came?	 That	 seemed	 like	 a	 lot	 of unnecessary	effort.	After	all,	no	one	was	using	the	spare	bedroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 went	 into	 the	 bathroom	 to	 get	 a	 drink	 of	 water	 and	 saw	 the	 big	 bottle	 of ibuprofen	sitting	on	the	counter,	the	cap	still	off,	as	if	my	father	hadn’t	possessed the	strength	or	will	to	put	it	back	on	again.	Fingers	shaking,	I	picked	it	up	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">twisted	it	onto	the	bottle,	then	put	the	ibuprofen	back	in	the	medicine	cabinet.	I didn’t	want	to	leave	a	messy	house	behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Messy	 for	 whom,	 I	 didn’t	 know.	 From	 what	 my	 father	 had	 said,	 it	 didn’t sound	as	if	anyone	was	getting	out	of	this	alive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	thermometer	was	lying	on	the	top	rack	in	the	medicine	cabinet.	I	already</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew	I	wasn’t	sick,	but	I	needed	the	external	reminder.	I	took	it	out,	opened	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bottle	of	rubbing	alcohol,	and	wiped	down	one	end	of	the	thermometer.	Then	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">stuck	it	in	my	mouth	and	waited. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">98.1</i>.	Up	a	little	from	the	last	time,	but	still	below	normal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 rinsed	 it	 off	 and	 put	 it	 away.	 Then,	 moving	 so	 slowly	 I	 felt	 as	 if	 I	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>dragging	 my	 feet	 through	 mud,	 I	 went	 back	 to	 my	 parents’	 bedroom,	 half expecting	 to	 see	 a	 pile	 of	 dust	 there.	 To	 my	 surprise,	 my	 father’s	 eyes	 opened when	 I	 came	 into	 the	 room.	 They	 were	 bright	 with	 fever	 and	 had	 those	 telltale dark	circles	beneath	them,	but	they	seemed	lucid	enough.	Maybe	he	wasn’t	as	far</p>
<p class="calibre1">gone	as	he	had	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dad,	I	could	try	some	ice	—	” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 very	 small	 shake	 of	 his	 head.	 “No.	 Once	 you	 have	 it,	 you’re	 done.”	 His eyes	 shut,	 and	 I	 could	 see	 how	 his	 big	 frame	 was	 wracked	 with	 shivers,	 even though	he’d	pulled	the	blanket	up	to	his	chin.	“I’m	sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry?”	I	repeated,	wondering	what	he	had	to	be	sorry	for.	“None	of	this	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	fault.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	 —	 not	 that.”	 He	 shifted	 under	 the	 covers,	 then	 opened	 his	 eyes	 again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry	that	we’ll	all	be	gone,	and	you’ll	still	be	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	in	his	words	chilled	me.	In	that	moment,	I	could	see	how	dying</p>
<p class="calibre1">along	with	everyone	else	might	be	preferable	to	being	left	in	a	world	with	no	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	talk	to,	no	one	to	even	know	I’d	somehow	managed	to	survive.	Voice	brittle,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">replied,	“Oh,	I’m	sure	I’m	not	long	for	this	world,	either.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fever?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	closed	his	eyes.	It	seemed	as	if	he	didn’t	have	the	strength	to	keep	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">open	and	focused	on	me	for	more	than	a	few	seconds	at	a	time.	“You’re	immune, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jess.	Don’t	know	how…or	why….” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">That	 is	 not	 your	 fate. </i>	 Despite	 the	 stuffiness	 of	 the	 room,	 I	 shivered	 as	 I thought	of	those	words,	spoken	gently	by	someone	who	wasn’t	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Write	down	what’s	happened.	Maybe…there’ll	be	someone	left	to	tell.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded,	then	realized	he	couldn’t	see	me.	“I	will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Might	as	well	put	that	English	degree	to	some	use.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Oh,	Dad. </i> Even	at	the	end,	he	had	to	make	a	joke.	“All	the	commas	will	be	in the	right	place.	I	promise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	 reply.	 He	 could	 have	 simply	 fallen	 asleep,	 but	 I	 didn’t	 think	 so.	 Unlike my	 mother	 and	 Devin,	 he’d	 pushed	 all	 the	 way	 to	 the	 end,	 burned	 the	 candle until	no	more	wick	was	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow	I	put	one	foot	in	front	of	the	other,	walking	slowly	until	I	reached</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	side	of	the	bed.	A	finger	against	his	throat,	telling	me	that	he	had	gone,	had left	 this	 world	 and	 was	 with	 Mom	 and	 Devin.	 I	 had	 to	 believe	 that.	 I’d	 break apart	otherwise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	his	eyes	were	closed,	I	didn’t	bother	to	pull	the	sheet	up	over	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon	it	wouldn’t	matter	anyway.	He’d	be	a	pile	of	dust,	as	no	doubt	my	brother</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	by	now	as	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>I	 didn’t	 recall	 going	 downstairs,	 but	 the	 next	 thing	 I	 did	 remember,	 I	 was standing	in	the	kitchen,	staring	down	at	my	father’s	half-drunk	glass	of	Scotch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ice	had	mostly	melted,	shifting	the	color	to	a	pale	gold.	Without	thinking,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">lifted	 the	 glass	 and	 brought	 it	 to	 my	 lips,	 poured	 the	 liquid	 within	 down	 my throat.	It	burned,	but	not	as	much	as	I	had	thought	it	would. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	did	it	matter	that	my	father	had	drunk	from	that	same	glass?	According</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	him,	I	was	immune.	The	thing	that	had	killed	him	couldn’t	touch	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	last	I	could	feel	tears	pricking	at	my	eyes,	stinging	like	acid,	but	I	knew	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t	let	them	fall.	If	I	did,	I	knew	they	would	never	stop.	What	was	that	old</p>
<p class="calibre1">song,	about	some	girl’s	tears	drowning	the	world?	That	would	be	me,	if	I	wept</p>
<p class="calibre1">now.	 Then	 again,	 maybe	 that	 wouldn’t	 be	 such	 a	 bad	 thing.	 Maybe	 a	 river,	 an ocean	of	tears,	would	wash	away	all	this	death,	all	the	dust	of	people’s	lives	left behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe.	In	the	meantime,	I	had	something	I	needed	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 parents	 had	 always	 loved	 the	 big	 oak	 tree	 in	 the	 backyard.	 In	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">summer,	they	hung	a	hammock	there,	and	had	a	pair	of	Adirondack	chairs	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	drag	out	underneath	it	so	they	could	sit	in	the	shade	and	drink	iced	tea	and plan	the	yearly	family	vacation,	or	maybe	just	a	long	weekend,	so	we	could	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	fun	like	go	hiking	up	around	Angel	Fire	or	visit	the	museums	in	Santa</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fe,	or	take	the	long	trip	down	to	Carlsbad	Caverns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 those	 things	 we’d	 done	 together	 as	 a	 family.	 Well,	 I’d	 make	 sure	 my family	was	together	in	the	end,	even	if	I	couldn’t	be	with	them.	It	was	the	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	I	could	think	of	to	say	goodbye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	father	kept	all	the	gardening	tools	in	a	shed	next	to	the	garage,	since	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">garage	 itself	 was	 full	 of	 camping	 equipment	 and	 tools	 and	 the	 usual	 crap	 any family	of	four	tends	to	accumulate	over	the	years.	I	went	to	the	shed	and	got	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 shovel,	 then	 headed	 back	 to	 the	 oak	 tree,	 staking	 out	 the	 spot	 where	 those Adirondack	chairs	usually	sat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	wouldn’t	have	to	be	a	very	deep	hole.	After	all,	I	was	only	burying	dust, </p>
<p class="calibre1">not	bodies.	The	ground	was	not	as	hard	as	I’d	feared,	mostly	because	my	father</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	given	the	old	oak	one	of	its	bimonthly	soakings	with	the	hose	only	this	past</p>
<p class="calibre1">weekend.	I	dug	and	dug,	dirt	flying	out	around	me,	only	stopping	when	it	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	I	was	about	to	hit	a	big	tree	root.	The	hole	was	far	larger	than	it	needed	to be,	but	better	that	than	the	opposite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	leaned	the	shovel	against	the	shed,	then	went	into	the	kitchen	to	wash	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands.	After	that,	I	got	a	clean	glass	from	the	cupboard	and	filled	it	with	water, then	drank	slowly,	deliberately.	I	knew	what	was	waiting	for	me	upstairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	enough	room	left	in	my	mother’s	Waterford	vase	for	the	dust	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">father	left	behind,	so	I	poured	it	in	on	top	of	my	mother’s	remains.	Going	back	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>Devin’s	 room	 seemed	 far	 more	 difficult,	 for	 some	 reason;	 maybe	 it	 was	 that	 I hadn’t	 really	 been	 able	 to	 say	 goodbye	 to	 him.	 At	 least	 my	 father	 and	 I	 had shared	those	last	few	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sight	of	the	dust	didn’t	shock	me	anymore,	but	it	was	still	awful	enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	know	that	my	brother	had	been	lying	in	the	same	spot	only	an	hour	earlier.	His</p>
<p class="calibre1">MVP	trophy	from	the	previous	football	season	seemed	about	the	right	size,	so	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">did	 the	 same	 thing	 I	 had	 with	 my	 parents’	 remains,	 using	 the	 bedclothes	 as	 a funnel	 to	 pour	 the	 dust	 into	 the	 receptacle	 I’d	 selected.	 That	 dust	 was	 a	 dark, cloudy	gray,	fine	as	silt,	and	seemed	oddly	liquid	as	I	tipped	it	into	the	trophy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 took	 Devin	 downstairs	 first,	 carefully	 setting	 the	 trophy	 down	 on	 the breakfast	bar	before	returning	to	the	second	story	to	retrieve	the	Waterford	vase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	went	into	the	ground	in	reverse	order,	my	parents’	dust	poured	into	the	hole</p>
<p class="calibre1">first,	 followed	 by	 Devin’s.	 Grimly,	 I	 retrieved	 the	 shovel	 and	 began	 piling	 the dirt	 back	 on	 top	 of	 the	 dust,	 holding	 my	 breath	 in	 case	 any	 should	 plume	 up during	 the	 process.	 At	 last,	 though,	 the	 hole	 was	 more	 or	 less	 filled.	 I	 dragged the	shovel	back	and	forth,	smoothing	the	surface,	attempting	to	make	it	as	level</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	was	the	time	to	say	a	few	words,	but	nothing	seemed	to	come	to	mind.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t	even	remember	the	Lord’s	Prayer,	or	more	than	the	first	few	words	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Twenty-third	Psalm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre3">The	Lord	is	my	shepherd</i>,”	I	began,	then	shook	my	head.	What	came	next? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lines	were	all	jumbled	together	in	my	head,	nonsense	syllables	that	sounded</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	something	straight	out	of	“Jabberwocky.”	And	what	did	it	matter,	anyway? </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 weren’t	 a	 religious	 family;	 we	 went	 to	 Christmas	 Eve	 services	 some	 years and	some	years	not,	maybe	Easter.	I’d	gone	to	Sunday	school	when	I	was	really</p>
<p class="calibre1">little,	but	my	parents	hadn’t	even	bothered	with	that	when	Devin	came	along. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 the	 longest	 time	 I	 stood	 there	 under	 the	 oak,	 the	 sun	 disappearing altogether,	 deep	 dusk	 falling	 upon	 the	 yard.	 Then	 I	 moved,	 and	 the	 motion-sensor	light	mounted	to	the	side	of	the	garage	flashed	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 love	 you	 all,”	 I	 said	 finally,	 then	 set	 the	 Waterford	 vase	 and	 the	 football trophy	on	top	of	their	grave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	that,	I	went	back	inside	and	shut	the	door	behind	me.	It	seemed	to	echo</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	unnatural	stillness	of	the	house,	and	I	realized	it	was	hardly	ever	this	quiet</p>
<p class="calibre1">—	 someone	 always	 had	 the	 TV	 on	 in	 the	 background,	 or	 there	 was	 music</p>
<p class="calibre1">playing,	or	somebody	talking	on	the	phone.	Now	the	quiet	pounded	against	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">eardrums,	 and	 I	 realized	 how	 big	 a	 three-bedroom,	 two-thousand-square-foot house	could	feel	when	you	were	the	only	one	in	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The	only	one	in	the	world…. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 thought	 whispered	 through	 my	 mind,	 and	 I	 did	 my	 best	 to	 ignore	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>Surely	if	I	were	immune,	and	not	just	having	extremely	delayed-onset	symptoms for	some	reason,	that	meant	other	people	had	to	be	immune,	too.	How	many?	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t	begin	to	guess.	I	didn’t	know	the	mortality	rate	of	the	disease.	Even	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">99.9%	 of	 the	 population	 was	 dead,	 that	 would	 leave	 around	 a	 thousand	 people still	 alive	 in	 the	 greater	 Albuquerque	 area,	 if	 I	 was	 doing	 my	 mental	 math correctly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	on	the	overhead	lights	in	the	kitchen,	then	went	through	the	house, </p>
<p class="calibre1">turning	on	all	the	lamps.	Maybe	that	wasn’t	the	smartest	thing	to	do	—	maybe</p>
<p class="calibre1">advertising	my	presence	would	do	more	harm	than	good.	But	I	couldn’t	sit	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 dark,	 not	 after	 everything	 I’d	 been	 through	 that	 day.	 Besides,	 when	 I peeked	out	through	the	curtains,	I	saw	mine	wasn’t	the	only	house	on	the	street</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	was	all	lit	up.	Most	likely	the	others	just	had	their	lights	on	because	no	one was	around	to	turn	them	off,	but	it	did	make	mine	seem	less	conspicuous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	 you	 there?”	 I	 asked	 of	 the	 darkness.	 Even	 a	 voice	 that	 was	 only	 a product	 of	 my	 imagination	 was	 better	 than	 this	 deep,	 deep	 silence,	 the	 kind	 of quiet	you	should	never	hear	if	you	lived	in	a	big	city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	reply,	of	course.	My	gaze	shifted	to	the	remote	control,	still	lying	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	last	dropped	it	on	the	coffee	table.	I	didn’t	want	to	turn	on	the	television,	not after	what	I’d	seen	the	last	time	around.	Would	it	all	be	static	by	now,	or	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 one	 station	 still	 be	 showing	 blaring	 red	 text	 with	 more	 quotes	 from Revelations? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	too	much	of	a	coward	to	pick	up	the	remote	and	find	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	there	was	still	the	stereo,	and	all	the	CDs	my	parents	wouldn’t	get	rid	of, </p>
<p class="calibre1">despite	Devin	and	me	telling	them	all	that	plastic	just	took	up	space	and	that	they should	just	rip	all	their	music	off	those	CDs	and	then	play	it	through	Apple	TV</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	something.	And	now	I	had	to	be	grateful	for	their	stubbornness,	because	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">meant	 I	 could	 get	 up	 and	 choose	 something	 to	 blot	 out	 the	 silence.	 My	 father liked	country,	but	old	country,	like	Hank	Williams	and	Willie	Nelson	and	Patsy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cline,	and	my	mother	preferred	classical.	That	sounded	better	to	me	right	then, </p>
<p class="calibre1">so	I	found	her	favorite,	Rachmaninoff’s	Second	Piano	Concerto,	and	put	that	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 actually	 was	 better,	 with	 the	 sound	 of	 an	 orchestra	 and	 Vladimir</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ashkenazy	 on	 the	 piano	 drowning	 out	 that	 awful	 stillness.	 Or	 at	 least	 it	 was better	until	I	realized	that	no	one	would	ever	play	that	piece	live	again,	that	there would	 be	 no	 more	 symphony	 orchestras	 or	 Arcade	 Fire	 concerts	 or	 anything, ever	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	God,”	I	gasped,	pushing	myself	up	from	the	couch	and	running	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">kitchen,	where	I	turned	on	the	faucet	and	splashed	cold	water	in	my	face.	As	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 could	 begin	 to	 help.	 It	 was	 all	 too	 big	 to	 comprehend,	 so	 awful	 and enormous	 that	 I	 could	 literally	 feel	 the	 horror	 of	 it	 beginning	 to	 sink	 in,	 like</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>some	noxious	chemical	seeping	into	my	skin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then	 it	 was	 as	 though	 strong,	 invisible	 arms	 wrapped	 around	 me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">bringing	with	them	a	soothing	warmth.	Unseen	lips	brushed	against	my	hair,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	heard	the	voice	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Be	strong,	my	love.	Be	strong	for	just	a	while	longer. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	as	suddenly,	the	presence	was	gone.	I	held	on	to	the	tile	of	the	kitchen</p>
<p class="calibre1">counter,	 feeling	 the	 cool	 surface	 beneath	 my	 fingertips.	 In	 that	 moment,	 I	 truly wondered	if	I’d	lost	my	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	other	explanation	could	there	be? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a><img src="index-51_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="index-51_2.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">FIVE</p>
<p class="calibre1">More	because	I	knew	I	should	eat	something	than	because	I	had	any	appetite	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">all,	 I	 gathered	 myself	 enough	 to	 put	 a	 few	 slices	 of	 wheat	 bread	 in	 the	 toaster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	they	were	done,	I	buttered	them	and	set	them	on	a	plate,	then	headed	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	to	the	living	room,	where	Rachmaninoff	still	played	to	the	empty	space.	Just</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	I	was	setting	my	plate	down	on	the	coffee	table,	the	lights	flickered	and	went</p>
<p class="calibre1">out,	and	the	CD	slurred	to	a	halt.	Silence	reigned	once	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heart	 slamming	 painfully	 in	 my	 chest,	 I	 waited	 a	 second,	 then	 another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Surely	 this	 had	 to	 be	 just	 a	 glitch.	 In	 a	 second	 or	 two,	 the	 power	 would	 come back	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 it	 didn’t.	 How	 could	 the	 power	 plants	 run,	 with	 no	 one	 left	 to	 manage them? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	blackness	was	absolute.	From	my	camping	days,	I	knew	how	dark,	how</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">very</i>	 dark,	 our	 desert	 skies	 could	 be.	 This	 seemed	 worse,	 though,	 because	 this wasn’t	 the	 expected	 dark	 of	 a	 night	 out	 under	 the	 stars.	 I	 was	 in	 the	 heart	 of Albuquerque,	New	Mexico.	It	wasn’t	supposed	to	be	like	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Luckily,	my	mother	loved	candles,	and	so	there	were	already	a	pair	of	pillars</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 wrought-iron	 sconces	 on	 the	 mantel,	 and	 another	 pillar	 candle	 sitting	 on	 a metal	leaf-shaped	dish	on	an	end	table.	She	kept	a	long-handled	lighter	in	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	coffee	table’s	drawers,	so	I	reached	in	and	fumbled	around	for	a	few	seconds</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	locating	it.	As	soon	as	I	pulled	it	out	of	the	drawer,	I	pressed	the	button	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>activate	the	flame.	That	pushed	back	on	the	darkness	a	little,	and	it	got	that	much better	 when	 I	 lit	 the	 candle	 on	 the	 table	 next	 to	 me.	 Then	 I	 had	 enough illumination	that	I	could	get	up	and	light	the	candles	on	the	mantel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	 there	 I	 went	 into	 the	 kitchen	 and	 found	 the	 sugar	 cookie–scented	 jar candle	 sitting	 on	 the	 breakfast	 bar,	 and	 lit	 that	 as	 well.	 Upstairs	 —	 well,	 I’d worry	 about	 that	 later.	 At	 least	 now	 I	 wasn’t	 blundering	 around	 in	 total darkness…and	the	candle	flames	weren’t	bright	enough	that	they	would	be	seen</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	the	drapes	and	blinds,	all	of	which	I	quickly	closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	the	same,	I	knew	there	was	one	thing	I	really	needed	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	ground	floor	was	a	study	that	my	parents	shared,	although	in	reality	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 mostly	 my	 mother’s	 space,	 housing	 her	 desk	 and	 computer	 and	 several shelves	full	of	books.	On	the	opposite	wall,	though,	was	my	father’s	gun	safe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	the	combination.	He’d	trusted	me	with	that,	just	as	he	trusted	me	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	responsible	when	we	went	shooting	and	to	clean	the	guns	I	used	and	follow</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	 the	 safety	 rules	 he’d	 taught	 me.	 I	 wasn’t	 sure	 if	 Devin	 had	 known	 the combination,	 although	 I	 somehow	 doubted	 it;	 my	 father	 hadn’t	 given	 me	 that information	 until	 I	 turned	 twenty-one.	 And	 even	 though	 I	 might	 be	 the	 only person	 left	 alive	 in	 Albuquerque,	 no	 way	 was	 I	 sitting	 alone	 in	 this	 house without	some	means	to	protect	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lock	turned	easily,	of	course.	My	father	took	as	good	care	of	the	safe	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	did	the	guns	inside.	There	were	a	lot,	too	—	in	addition	to	his	service	Glock, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 owned	 an	 AR-15	 rifle,	 two	 shotguns,	 a	 small	 .22-caliber	 hunting	 rifle,	 a Ruger,	 a	 Beretta,	 and	 my	 favorite,	 the	 Smith	 &amp;	 Wesson	 .357.	 Sort	 of	 an	 old-fashioned	 gun,	 but	 my	 accuracy	 had	 always	 been	 good	 with	 it.	 Besides,	 with	 a revolver,	you	didn’t	have	to	worry	about	the	gun	jamming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	set	the	candle	I’d	brought	with	me	down	on	my	mother’s	desk,	then	opened</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	safe.	Hanging	from	one	of	the	sleeves	on	the	door	was	the	.357,	and	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shelf	directly	opposite	the	gun,	boxes	of	spare	ammo.	My	father	wasn’t	exactly</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	you’d	call	a	survivalist	type,	but	he	did	believe	in	maintaining	his	supplies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	necessary,	I	could	waste	a	lot	of	bad	guys	before	I	ran	out.	Not	that	there	were probably	 any	 bad	 guys	 left.	 This	 was	 more	 for	 my	 own	 peace	 of	 mind	 than anything	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 lifting	 the	 S&amp;W	 from	 where	 it	 rested,	 I	 pushed	 the	 latch	 forward	 to release	the	barrel,	then	moved	the	latch	outward.	As	I’d	suspected,	the	chambers</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 empty	 —	 my	 father	 didn’t	 believe	 in	 leaving	 loaded	 handguns	 lying</p>
<p class="calibre1">around,	 even	 in	 the	 safe.	 One	 by	 one,	 I	 dropped	 the	 bullets	 into	 the	 chambers, then	closed	the	gun	back	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Habit	made	me	shut	the	door	to	the	gun	safe	as	well,	and	make	sure	the	lock</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	fully	engaged.	Maybe	I	was	the	only	person	left	alive	in	Albuquerque…and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>maybe	 not.	 No	 matter	 what	 the	 reality	 of	 the	 situation	 might	 turn	 out	 to	 be,	 I didn’t	think	it	was	a	very	good	idea	to	leave	a	fully	stocked	gun	safe	accessible</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	just	anyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Picking	up	the	candle	with	my	free	hand,	I	went	back	out	to	the	living	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	toast	was	stone	cold	by	then,	but	I	made	myself	eat	it,	and	then	drank	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	 water.	 I	 set	 the	 gun	 down	 on	 the	 coffee	 table,	 within	 easy	 reach	 should	 I need	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	I	leaned	against	the	back	of	the	couch	and	shut	my	eyes,	wondering</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	the	hell	I	was	supposed	to	do	next.	My	entire	family	was	gone	—	I	had	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">grandparents	still	living,	but	I	had	no	reason	to	believe	they	hadn’t	suffered	the same	fate	as	my	parents	and	brother.	Three	cousins	and	an	aunt	and	uncle,	all	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	mother’s	side;	my	father	was	an	only	child.	Could	this	strange	immunity	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	to	be	protecting	me	have	somehow	sheltered	any	of	them?	Uncle	Jeremy</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	Aunt	Susan	also	lived	here	in	Albuquerque,	so	it	wouldn’t	be	that	hard	to	try</p>
<p class="calibre1">checking	 on	 them	 tomorrow,	 after	 the	 sun	 came	 up.	 No	 way	 was	 I	 venturing outside	in	the	dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	 it	 wasn’t	 the	 best	 idea	 —	 a	 fool’s	 errand,	 as	 my	 father	 might	 have said.	 But	 it	 was	 the	 only	 thing	 I	 could	 think	 of	 to	 try.	 There	 were	 my	 friends, too…Tori	and	Brittany	and	Elena.	I	had	no	reason	to	believe	they	hadn’t	suffered</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	same	fate	as	everyone	else,	but	again,	I	would	never	forgive	myself	if	I	didn’t try	to	find	out	what	had	happened	to	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">There	is	no	point.	They’re	all	gone. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	really?”	I	snapped	into	the	candlelit	darkness.	“How	are	you	so	sure	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Because	they	weren’t	immune. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	am.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Yes</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	answer	—	not	that	I’d	really	expected	one.	It	seemed	as	soon	as	I	asked</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	hard	questions,	the	voice	quickly	decamped.	Only	my	subconscious,	trying	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">convince	 me	 not	 to	 put	 myself	 in	 harm’s	 way?	 I	 wouldn’t	 be	 surprised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nevertheless,	I	knew	what	I	had	to	do	the	next	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>The	 next	 day,	 a	 bright	 sun	 rose	 on	 an	 empty	 world.	 I	 couldn’t	 bring	 myself	 to sleep	 upstairs,	 not	 even	 in	 the	 untouched	 guest	 bedroom.	 Too	 much	 death	 up there,	too	many	reminders	of	everything	I’d	lost.	Instead,	I’d	fetched	some	spare</p>
<p class="calibre1">blankets	from	the	linen	closet	and	spread	them	over	me	so	I	could	sleep	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">living	 room	 couch.	 That,	 more	 than	 anything	 else,	 was	 a	 sure	 sign	 of	 the apocalypse,	 since	 my	 mother	 would	 never	 have	 allowed	 her	 new	 sofa	 to	 be sullied	by	someone	sleeping	on	it	when	she	was	alive.	But	the	living	room	faced</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	on	the	street,	and	I	reasoned	I’d	better	be	able	to	listen	for	any	signs	of	life	or activity	on	the	road	by	sleeping	there,	rather	than	back	in	the	family	room,	which was	toward	the	rear	of	the	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	got	up	off	the	couch,	rubbed	the	kink	in	my	neck,	then	cautiously	pushed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 curtains	 aside	 so	 I	 could	 get	 a	 glimpse	 of	 what	 was	 going	 on	 in	 the neighborhood.	Not	much;	the	sprinklers	were	on	at	the	D’Ambrosios’	house	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	corner	opposite	ours,	but	I	knew	that	didn’t	mean	anything,	since	they	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 an	 automatic	 timer.	 As	 I	 watched,	 they	 seemed	 to	 shut	 themselves	 off,	 the bright	green	grass	of	the	yard	glinting	in	the	morning	sun.	Otherwise,	everything</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	completely	still. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No,	 scratch	 that	 —	 I	 saw	 the	 Munozes’	 shepherd	 mix	 nosing	 around	 in	 the grass	in	front	of	their	house	across	the	street.	She	was	a	wily	critter	and	got	out at	least	once	a	week,	but	now	I	guessed	it	was	because	she	was	hungry.	Luckily, </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 was	 a	 sweet	 dog	 and	 knew	 me.	 The	 power	 was	 out,	 and	 we	 had	 some leftovers	in	the	fridge	that	might	as	well	get	eaten	before	they	spoiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	let	the	curtain	drop	and	went	to	open	the	front	door.	The	morning	air	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">cool,	but	carried	with	it	the	smell	of	smoke.	Something	in	the	city	was	burning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here,	though,	we	seemed	to	be	safe	enough,	at	least	for	the	moment.	I’d	worry</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	the	fire	later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crouching	 down	 slightly,	 I	 called	 out,	 “Dutchie!	 Dutchie!”	 Hector	 Munoz</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	been	a	professor	of	Spanish	literature	at	UNM,	and	I	think	Dutchie’s	original</p>
<p class="calibre1">name	 had	 been	 Dulcinea.	 The	 Munozes’	 little	 girl,	 Jaclyn,	 couldn’t	 pronounce the	 name,	 though,	 and	 so	 Dulcinea	 had	 sort	 of	 degenerated	 into	 “Dutchie.”	 A sharp,	knifing	pain	went	through	me,	though,	as	I	thought	of	little	Jaclyn	and	her big	brown	eyes	and	her	endlessly	asking	“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	a	feeling	she	wouldn’t	be	asking	any	more	questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dog	lifted	her	head	and	looked	over	at	me,	one	ear	cocked	slightly.	No</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	 was	 completely	 sure	 of	 Dutchie’s	 heritage.	 Best	 guess	 was	 part	 German shepherd,	part	border	collie,	and	part	Lord	knows	what,	but	she	was	a	beautiful</p>
<p class="calibre1">dog,	with	a	silky	black	and	tan	coat,	and	one	blue	eye	and	one	brown	eye.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">blue	eye	seemed	to	focus	on	me	particularly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 gave	 a	 little	 shake	 and	 then	 trotted	 obediently	 over	 to	 me,	 pushing	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>head	 against	 my	 knee	 and	 giving	 the	 faintest	 of	 whines.	 Poor	 thing	 had	 to	 be hungry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	want	some	breakfast?”	I	asked	her,	and	both	her	ears	went	up.	Just	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	old	dog	Sadie,	who’d	passed	last	winter.	Debates	had	still	been	raging	at	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">house	as	to	when	would	be	a	good	time	to	get	another	dog…not	that	it	mattered</p>
<p class="calibre1">now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Sadie	had	had	an	extensive	vocabulary	when	it	came	to	anything	food-</p>
<p class="calibre1">related,	and	it	seemed	as	if	Dutchie	was	the	same	way.	She	padded	after	me	as	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">tucked	 the	 revolver	 into	 my	 waistband,	 then	 went	 into	 the	 kitchen,	 got	 a	 bowl from	one	of	the	cupboards,	and	poured	her	some	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 least,	 that	 was	 what	 I	 intended	 to	 do.	 When	 I	 turned	 the	 tap,	 however, nothing	happened.	A	few	drops	sputtered	from	the	faucet,	but	that	was	it.	So	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">water	was	gone,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	fluttery	feeling	of	panic	returned,	and	I	forced	it	down.	When	we	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 home,	 we	 got	 our	 water	 from	 the	 dispenser	 in	 the	 refrigerator	 door,	 but	 we always	kept	a	couple	pallets	of	bottled	water	in	the	pantry	for	road	trips	or	even just	running	around	town.	I	wasn’t	going	to	die	of	thirst	anytime	soon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 fetched	 one	 of	 the	 water	 bottles	 and	 poured	 its	 contents	 into	 the	 bowl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dutchie	 began	 slurping	 it	 up	 greedily,	 so	 while	 she	 was	 occupied,	 I	 got	 out	 a plate	and	then	retrieved	one	of	the	covered	storage	bowls	in	the	fridge,	the	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 the	 leftover	 roasted	 chicken	 from	 the	 weekend.	 Taking	 out	 one	 of	 the chicken	legs	and	shredding	it	onto	the	plate	relaxed	me	a	little,	made	me	focus</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	something	other	than	the	dry	tap.	If	I	attempted	to	turn	on	one	of	the	burners</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	stove,	would	it	light?	Or	was	the	gas	out,	too? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	 likely.	 Which	 meant	 there	 would	 be	 no	 heat.	 Yesterday	 had	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">warmer	 than	 normal,	 but	 I’d	 heard	 that	 temperatures	 were	 supposed	 to	 start dipping	 toward	 the	 end	 of	 the	 week.	 Conditions	 might	 become	 downright</p>
<p class="calibre1">uncomfortable. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Oh,	like	they’re	so	wonderful	right	now</i>,	my	brain	mocked	me	as	I	bent	down to	give	Dutchie	the	plate	of	chicken.	She	immediately	abandoned	the	water	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">wolfed	 down	 the	 bits	 of	 chicken	 leg,	 then	 looked	 up	 at	 me	 with	 pleading	 eyes when	she	was	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	 no	 more,	 you	 little	 pig,”	 I	 said	 with	 some	 affection,	 reaching	 to scratch	her	behind	the	ears.	Her	fur	was	soft	and	silky,	and	infinitely	reassuring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow	everything	didn’t	seem	quite	so	bad	if	I	could	have	Dutchie	with	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	whined,	and	I	remembered	we	still	had	some	dog	treats	up	on	the	highest</p>
<p class="calibre1">shelf	 in	 the	 pantry,	 left	 over	 after	 Sadie	 died.	 I	 got	 out	 the	 step	 stool,	 then climbed	 up	 and	 retrieved	 them.	 Dutchie	 watched	 the	 entire	 procedure,	 tail wagging,	and	I	gave	her	one	of	the	biscuits. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>“Better?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	 reply,	 of	 course,	 but	 I	 figured	 the	 way	 she	 was	 hunkered	 down	 on	 the kitchen	rug,	munching	on	the	biscuit,	tail	wagging,	told	me	everything	I	needed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	right.	So	I	had	some	companionship.	Now	I	had	to	take	care	of	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 appetite	 was	 still	 nowhere	 in	 evidence,	 but	 I	 helped	 myself	 to	 some	 of	 the leftover	chicken	as	well,	then	had	a	piece	of	bread	and	butter,	washed	down	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">water	from	another	bottle	I	took	from	the	pallet.	Obviously,	a	shower	was	out	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	question,	but	I	took	some	of	the	water	and	splashed	it	on	my	face.	It	helped	a little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carrying	 the	 half-full	 bottle	 of	 water,	 I	 went	 out	 the	 back	 door,	 Dutchie following	 me,	 and	 headed	 up	 to	 my	 apartment.	 Everything	 looked	 so	 normal there,	so	unchanged,	and	I	realized	I	hadn’t	been	there	since	my	parents	—	since</p>
<p class="calibre1">Devin	—	well,  <i class="calibre3">since</i>.	It	was	no	sanctuary,	though,	no	place	where	I	could	hide from	what	had	happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 wasn’t	 my	 reason	 for	 being	 here,	 though.	 I	 set	 the	 gun	 down	 on	 the coffee	table,	got	out	of	my	clothes	from	the	day	before	and	stuffed	them	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hamper,	 and	 then	 pulled	 on	 fresh	 jeans	 and	 socks,	 and	 a	 waffle-weave	 henley shirt	 I	 wore	 sometimes	 when	 I	 went	 hiking.	 My	 hiking	 boots	 were	 tucked	 into the	far	corner	of	the	closet,	and	I	got	them	out	as	well	and	laced	them	on.	I	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	 idea	 what	 I	 might	 encounter	 today,	 so	 it	 seemed	 smart	 to	 be	 wearing comfortable,	 serviceable	 clothes,	 the	 kinds	 of	 things	 that	 wouldn’t	 get	 in	 my way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Speaking	of	which	—</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 headed	 into	 the	 bathroom,	 brushed	 my	 hair,	 and	 pulled	 it	 back	 with	 an elastic	 band.	 Afterward,	 I	 brushed	 my	 teeth,	 being	 as	 sparing	 with	 the	 bottled water	as	I	could.	No	point	in	wearing	any	makeup,	but	I	put	on	some	colored	lip</p>
<p class="calibre1">balm	because	the	weather	was	dry,	and	they	felt	parched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During	all	this,	Dutchie	sat	in	the	middle	of	my	tiny	living	room	and	watched</p>
<p class="calibre1">me.	 After	 I	 had	 extracted	 my	 wallet	 from	 my	 purse	 and	 slipped	 it	 into	 my pocket,	then	tucked	the	S&amp;W	back	into	my	waistband,	I	paused	and	asked	her, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Am	I	crazy	for	doing	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	cocked	her	head	to	one	side,	mismatched	eyes	shining.	Apparently,	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t	have	an	opinion	on	my	preparations,	but	was	probably	hoping	for	another</p>
<p class="calibre1">dog	biscuit	when	we	got	back	to	the	kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,”	I	told	her.	“I’ll	see	what	I	can	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tail	 wagging,	 she	 ran	 out	 the	 door	 as	 soon	 as	 I	 opened	 it,	 then	 practically galloped	 down	 the	 stairs.	 From	 what	 I	 could	 tell,	 she	 wasn’t	 exactly	 pining	 for her	former	masters.	Or	maybe	she	was	just	so	happy	to	see	someone	—	anyone</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>—	that	she	was	willing	to	be	their	new	best	friend,	no	matter	what. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	 we	 were	 back	 in	 the	 kitchen,	 I	 gave	 her	 another	 dog	 biscuit,	 then hesitated	 at	 the	 key	 rack	 by	 the	 back	 door.	 If	 I	 was	 really	 going	 to	 venture	 out into	deserted	Albuquerque,	I	didn’t	think	my	little	Honda	was	the	best	choice	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">vehicles.	My	mother’s	Escape	had	all-wheel	drive,	but	I	knew	my	father’s	Grand</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cherokee	was	the	sturdiest	car	we	owned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	hand	shook	as	I	took	the	key	with	its	leather	fob	from	the	rack.	My	father</p>
<p class="calibre1">loved	that	SUV	—	washed	it	every	week,	changed	the	oil	regularly,	conditioned</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	leather	seats,	the	whole	thing.	He’d	never	let	me	or	Devin	drive	it,	and	even</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	mother	was	only	allowed	behind	the	wheel	if	her	own	car	was	in	the	shop	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">something.	But	my	father	was	far	past	caring	about	the	Cherokee,	and	I	knew	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	my	best	bet	for	getting	where	I	needed	to	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">There	is	no	point, </i>	the	voice	in	my	head	said	sadly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	is	a	point,”	I	retorted.	“I	need	to	know	if	they’re	alive	or	dead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">You	already	know	the	answer	to	that. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	don’t.	Not	for	sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Your	heart	does</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	want	to	believe	him.	In	fact,	I	refused	to	believe	him.	Voice	tight,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">asked,	“All	right	—	where	do	 <i class="calibre3">you</i>	think	I	should	go?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	answer	was	immediate.  <i class="calibre3">North</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“North?”	 I	 repeated	 in	 some	 incredulity.	 “You	 do	 know	 that	 winter	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">coming,	 right?	 If	 I	 have	 to	 get	 out	 of	 Albuquerque,	 it	 would	 make	 a	 lot	 more sense	to	go	south,	to	Alamogordo	or	Las	Cruces.”  <i class="calibre3">Or	Roswell, </i>	I	added	mentally. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Maybe	I	can	go	there	and	stick	my	thumb	out,	see	if	the	aliens	might	give	me	a</i> <i class="calibre3">ride	right	out	of	here. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">North</i>.	The	voice	sounded	implacable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 I’ll	 take	 that	 under	 advisement,”	 I	 said	 lightly.	 “For	 now,	 though,	 I have	some	friends	and	family	to	check	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">It	is	a	mistake. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	it’ll	be	 <i class="calibre3">my</i>	mistake.	Come	on,	Dutchie.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had	 I	 already	 descended	 to	 arguing	 with	 the	 voices	 in	 my	 head?	 It	 sure looked	that	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 dog	 trotted	 after	 me	 as	 I	 went	 out	 the	 back	 door	 and	 over	 to	 the driveway.	 Good	 thing	 I’d	 decided	 on	 the	 Cherokee,	 as	 it	 was	 blocking	 my mother’s	car	anyway.	I	went	around	to	the	passenger	side	and	opened	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dutchie	didn’t	even	need	an	invitation	—	she	jumped	right	inside,	eyes	shining, </p>
<p class="calibre1">ears	up.	Her	claws	slipped	a	little	on	the	leather	seat,	and	I	winced.	I	had	to	hope that	my	father	really	had	gone	on	to	a	better	place,	one	where	he	couldn’t	see	his prized	SUV	getting	scratches	on	the	seats	and,	no	doubt,	dog	hair	everywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>I	 walked	 slowly	 around	 the	 back	 of	 the	 vehicle,	 watching,	 listening.	 Since the	D’Ambrosios’	sprinklers	had	shut	off	—	or,	more	likely,	run	out	of	water	—</p>
<p class="calibre1">besides	 the	 cawing	 of	 a	 few	 crows	 as	 they	 circled	 overhead,	 the	 neighborhood was	completely	still.	Again,	that	silence	made	the	skin	on	the	back	of	my	neck</p>
<p class="calibre1">prickle,	and	I	hastened	to	the	driver-side	door,	then	got	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 sound	 of	 the	 engine	 turning	 over	 seemed	 ear-piercingly	 loud	 after	 all that	quiet.	At	the	same	time,	the	radio	turned	on	in	a	burst	of	static,	and	I	quickly shut	 it	 off,	 knowing	 that	 there	 wouldn’t	 be	 anything	 useful	 on	 the	 radio,	 any more	 than	 there	 had	 been	 on	 the	 television.	 My	 father	 had	 probably	 been scanning	 the	 bands	 as	 he	 came	 home,	 looking	 for	 a	 report	 that	 would	 tell	 him what	was	going	on.	Something.	Anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 paused	 to	 slide	 the	 gun	 out	 of	 my	 waistband	 and	 into	 the	 glove</p>
<p class="calibre1">compartment	before	backing	the	Cherokee	out	into	the	street.	On	the	seat	beside</p>
<p class="calibre1">me,	Dutchie	had	her	head	up	and	was	sniffing	the	air,	even	though	the	windows</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	all	the	way	up.	I	rolled	down	the	one	next	to	her	so	she	could	stick	her	nose out,	then	slowed	before	we’d	gone	even	halfway	down	the	block.	I	knew	what	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	find,	but	I	had	to	check. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 front	 door	 to	 the	 Munozes’	 house	 was	 locked,	 but	 when	 I	 went	 around back,	 I	 discovered	 that	 the	 side	 door	 which	 led	 to	 their	 service	 porch	 was halfway	open.	The	reason	why	presented	itself	soon	enough	—	there	was	a	pile</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	gray	dust	just	inside,	right	in	front	of	the	dryer.	I	had	a	feeling,	though,	that whoever	had	gone	out	there	had	been	looking	for	more	ice,	as	the	Munozes	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	upright	freezer	tucked	into	one	corner,	away	from	the	other	appliances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grimacing,	 I	 stepped	 over	 the	 little	 pile	 of	 dust,	 glad	 that	 I’d	 left	 Dutchie inside	the	car.	“Professor	Munoz?”	I	called	out.	“Jaclyn?	Maria?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	answer,	of	course.	In	the	living	room,	I	saw	the	reason	why	—	a	pile	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">dust	on	the	sofa,	a	smaller	one	next	to	it.	I	couldn’t	know	for	sure	whether	it	was Maria	Munoz	or	her	husband	who	had	expired	in	the	laundry	room,	or	who	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 sitting	 on	 the	 couch	 next	 to	 their	 daughter.	 I	 supposed	 it	 really	 didn’t matter.	 They	 were	 gone.	 No	 wonder	 Dutchie	 had	 started	 wandering	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">neighborhood,	looking	for	someone	to	take	care	of	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	got	back	inside	the	Cherokee,	I	leaned	over	and	gave	the	dog	a	fierce</p>
<p class="calibre1">hug.	“I’m	here,	Dutchie,”	I	said.	“I	won’t	let	anything	happen	to	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	licked	my	cheek	and	let	out	a	whine,	but	a	questioning	one,	as	if	asking</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether	I	was	okay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No,	 I	 really	 was	 not	 okay,	 but	 I	 couldn’t	 let	 myself	 start	 to	 lose	 it	 now.	 I straightened,	gave	her	ears	a	quick	scratch,	and	then	started	up	the	SUV,	moving</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	 the	 street	 so	 I	 could	 get	 out	 onto	 Rio	 Grand	 Boulevard	 and	 head	 over	 to my	friend	Elena’s	house,	as	she	was	the	one	who	lived	closest	to	me.	After	that	it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>would	be	Tori’s,	and	then	my	Aunt	Susan	and	Uncle	Jeremy’s	house.	And	after that…. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	I’d	see	how	much	more	I	could	take	after	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	slower	going	than	I’d	expected,	mainly	because	a	lot	more	abandoned</p>
<p class="calibre1">cars	 choked	 the	 streets	 than	 I’d	 thought	 there	 would	 be.	 In	 my	 mind,	 I’d imagined	 more	 people	 would	 have	 made	 it	 home	 before	 they	 expired,	 but	 that didn’t	 seem	 to	 be	 the	 case.	 I	 had	 to	 weave	 in	 and	 out	 of	 the	 stopped	 vehicles, several	times	being	forced	up	on	the	curb	to	make	my	way	around	the	blockage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 everything	 so	 silent,	 so	 still,	 save	 for	 the	 ceaseless	 cawing	 of	 crows overhead. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">No	carrion	for	you	to	eat,	you	bastards, </i>	I	thought	as	I	eased	the	Cherokee	off yet	another	curb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	in	a	way,	I	had	to	be	thankful	for	that.	The	Heat	might	not	have	killed</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	to	start,	but	if	there	had	been	millions	of	corpses	left	behind	once	the	disease had	done	its	work,	typhoid	fever	or	cholera	surely	would	have	finished	the	job. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	into	the	residential	section	where	Elena	lived,	glad	to	see	there	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">fewer	vehicles	blocking	the	streets	here.	But	still	I	saw	no	sign	of	life	anywhere, not	one	person	stepping	out	of	a	house	to	flag	me	down,	to	let	me	know	at	least</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	other	soul	had	survived	the	plague	that	had	swept	over	the	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike	my	house,	which	always	had	a	full	driveway	and	my	car	parked	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">curb,	 Elena’s	 looked	 pristine.	 Then	 again,	 her	 family	 had	 more	 money	 —	 her father	was	a	lawyer	—	and	their	house	had	a	three-car	garage.	It	wasn’t	unusual</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	see	no	real	evidence	of	anyone	being	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 stopped	 the	 Cherokee,	 then	 reached	 into	 the	 glove	 compartment	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">retrieved	the	revolver.	Dutchie	looked	at	me,	wide-eyed,	as	if	wondering	what	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	world	I	needed	with	a	gun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	question,	Dutchie,”	I	said,	but	I	tucked	it	into	my	jeans	anyway.	“You</p>
<p class="calibre1">stay	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	wagged	her	tail	and	didn’t	try	to	get	out	of	the	car	as	I	exited	the	vehicle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	one	damn	good	dog. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	looking	around	quickly	and	not	seeing	anyone,	I	went	up	to	the	front</p>
<p class="calibre1">door	of	Elena’s	house.	Ringing	the	doorbell	was	no	use,	since	the	power	was	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	over	town.	Instead,	I	knocked,	then	waited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	 answer,	 but	 I	 hadn’t	 really	 been	 expecting	 one.	 I	 put	 my	 hand	 on	 the latch,	and,	to	my	surprise,	the	door	swung	inward.	It	seemed	logical	enough	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 last	 person	 to	 come	 home	 had	 been	 so	 ill	 they	 hadn’t	 bothered	 to	 lock	 the door	 behind	 them,	 but	 it	 unnerved	 me	 nonetheless.	 Swallowing	 hard,	 I	 made myself	enter	the	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 a	 big	 Santa	 Fe–style	 faux	 adobe,	 with	 tile	 floors	 and	 wood-beamed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>ceilings.	My	footsteps	echoed	through	the	two-story	foyer	as	I	moved	toward	the center	of	the	building.	Something	sweet	and	smoky	tickled	at	my	nose.	Incense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elena’s	 mother	 was	 a	 devout	 Catholic.	 Maybe	 she’d	 burned	 the	 incense	 as	 she prayed	to	God	to	save	her,	save	her	family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately,	God	didn’t	seem	to	be	listening	lately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	house	had	built-in	art	niches,	one	of	which	held	a	shrine	to	the	Madonna. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	saw	a	pile	of	gray	dust	immediately	in	front	of	it	and	knew	it	must	be	Gabriella Cruz.	 Limbs	 trembling,	 I	 made	 myself	 walk	 past	 it,	 go	 through	 the	 rest	 of	 the ground	 floor:	 the	 great	 room	 with	 the	 kitchen	 and	 family	 room	 combined,	 the formal	 dining	 room,	 the	 living	 room.	 No	 sign	 of	 Elena	 or	 her	 father.	 Which didn’t	mean	all	that	much.	There	was	still	the	upstairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pulse	 pounding	 painfully	 in	 my	 throat,	 I	 mounted	 the	 steps.	 The	 house	 had four	bedrooms,	one	of	which	was	an	office.	In	there	I	found	another	pile	of	gray</p>
<p class="calibre1">dust,	which	I	guessed	must	be	Eduardo	Cruz,	Elena’s	father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 bedroom	 was	 on	 the	 opposite	 side	 of	 the	 upstairs	 hallway,	 two	 doors down.	Truth	be	told,	I’d	always	envied	her	that	room,	with	its	own	bathroom	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	little	sitting	area	off	the	balcony.	It	felt	like	a	room	for	a	princess,	compared to	 the	 boxy	 twelve-by-twelve	 space	 that	 had	 been	 mine	 all	 through	 childhood and	 high	 school.	 No	 wonder	 Elena	 had	 never	 been	 too	 worried	 about	 moving out.	“I’ll	go	from	here	to	my	husband’s	house,”	she	used	to	say	with	a	laugh,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	rest	of	us	had	pretty	much	believed	her.	No	one	could	really	imagine	Elena</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying	to	scrape	by	in	a	tiny	one-bedroom	apartment,	just	for	a	spurious	sense	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">independence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	it	was	on	the	wrought-iron	bed,	with	its	filmy	topping	of	mosquito	net</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 matching	 white	 embroidered	 comforter,	 that	 I	 found	 the	 third	 pile	 of	 gray dust.	For	the	longest	moment,	I	just	stood	there,	staring	down	at	it,	remembering</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	friend’s	quick,	flashing	smile,	the	annoying	way	she	absolutely	could	not	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	a	movie	without	offering	her	own	running	commentary	on	it.	How	she’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">quietly	slipped	a	wad	of	money	into	my	hand	one	day	during	our	senior	year	so	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 get	 the	 prom	 dress	 I	 really	 wanted	 and	 not	 the	 bargain	 gown	 my	 mother was	pushing	me	into,	because	“in	five	years	you’re	just	not	going	to	care	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	wore.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	still	did	care…although	mainly	because	of	what	Elena	had	done	to	help</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	out,	and	not	the	dress	itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">You	see? </i>	the	voice	said,	its	tone	quiet	and	sad.  <i class="calibre3">There’s	no	point	in	you	doing</i> <i class="calibre3">this.	 You	 can’t	 save	 them.	 They’re	 already	 gone</i>.  <i class="calibre3">	 Mourn	 them	 if	 you	 must,	 but</i> <i class="calibre3">your	path	lies	northward. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wished	then	that	the	voice	were	real,	that	it	was	attached	to	a	real	body,	so	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	grab	it	by	the	shoulders	and	shake	it	for	being	so	thoughtless.	“That’s	not</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>the	point,”	I	said,	my	own	voice	trembling.	“I	need	to	know…and	I	need	to	say goodbye.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 remained	 silent	 then…wisely	 so.	 I	 reached	 out	 and	 touched	 the	 twisted wrought	iron	of	one	of	the	bedposts,	and	whispered,	“Sleep	well.”	Then	I	turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">away	 and	 walked	 down	 the	 hall,	 descended	 the	 steps,	 and	 went	 out	 the	 front door,	shutting	it	quietly	behind	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dutchie’s	tail	thumped	happily	as	I	got	back	in	the	Cherokee,	but	I	didn’t	say</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything,	only	reached	out	to	pet	her,	to	feel	her	silky	fur	beneath	my	cold,	cold fingers.	 For	 a	 long	 moment,	 I	 just	 sat	 there,	 the	 key	 still	 in	 my	 hand,	 the	 gun digging	uncomfortably	into	my	waistband.	Finally,	I	reached	back	and	pulled	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">out,	returning	it	to	the	glove	compartment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Uncle	Jeremy	and	Aunt	Susan	next.	Could	I	do	it?	Could	I	go	to	the	house</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	I’d	spent	Thanksgiving	and	Christmas	—	Susan	was	my	mother’s	sister, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	they	traded	holidays	so	no	one	family	would	have	to	do	all	the	work	—	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">walk	in	to	see	my	uncle	and	aunt	reduced	to	dust,	and	my	cousins	as	well?	Well, </p>
<p class="calibre1">two	of	them,	anyway.	My	cousin	Shane	was	in	college	in	California,	at	Stanford, </p>
<p class="calibre1">to	be	exact,	and	so	he	wouldn’t	be	around.	He	would	have	died	far	away	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	  <i class="calibre3">he	 died, </i>	 I	 reminded	 myself	 fiercely.  <i class="calibre3">He	 could	 be	 immune,	 too.	 You	 don’t</i> <i class="calibre3">know. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">No,	I	didn’t	know.	I	just	wasn’t	sure	how	I	would	ever	find	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	 so,	 I	 put	 the	 key	 in	 the	 ignition,	 then	 turned	 it,	 pointing	 the	 vehicle north	and	east,	toward	Sandia	Heights.	It	was	a	longer	jog	than	the	one	from	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">house	 to	 Elena’s,	 but	 up	 here	 the	 streets	 didn’t	 feel	 quite	 as	 crammed	 with abandoned	vehicles.	There	was	plenty	of	evidence	of	unexpected	death	—	cars</p>
<p class="calibre1">crashed	 into	 walls,	 into	 trees,	 into	 one	 another.	 And	 as	 I	 gained	 some	 height,	 I could	 now	 see	 that	 the	 smoke	 I	 had	 smelled	 earlier	 seemed	 to	 be	 coming	 from the	city	center.	Downtown	itself,	maybe,	or	the	university.	I	couldn’t	tell	for	sure from	this	distance,	and	it	didn’t	really	matter.	That	was	miles	from	where	I	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">now,	 miles	 from	 my	 house.	 It	 might	 spread	 that	 far,	 but	 I	 had	 a	 feeling	 I’d	 be long	gone	by	then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	drove	along	Academy	Road,	I	passed	a	PetSmart	and	saw	the	strangest</p>
<p class="calibre1">sight.	All	kinds	of	dogs	were	converging	on	the	store,	and	right	out	in	front	I	saw several	of	them	tearing	into	big	bags	of	dog	food,	then	beginning	to	feast.	More</p>
<p class="calibre1">dogs	came	to	join	them,	but	there	was	no	fighting	over	the	food.	In	fact,	I	even</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw	a	big	pit	bull	mix	move	to	one	side	to	let	a	fluffy	little	dog	—	a	Maltese,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">guessed	—	come	in	next	to	him	and	start	eating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	the	—	”	I	said	aloud,	and	Dutchie	swiveled	her	head	in	my	direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The	animals	will	be	taken	care	of, </i> the	voice	told	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>I’d	been	so	caught	up	in	my	own	losses,	and	so	relieved	to	have	Dutchie	by my	 side,	 that	 I	 hadn’t	 even	 stopped	 to	 think	 what	 would	 happen	 to	 all	 those thousands	of	ownerless	pets	left	with	no	resources,	no	one	to	watch	over	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ll	be	taken	care	of?”	I	demanded.	“By	whom?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">They	will	not	suffer.	They	are	innocents. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 whole	 situation	 was	 getting	 stranger	 by	 the	 minute.	 The	 way	 all	 the bodies	of	the	dead	had	dissolved	into	dust	seemed	to	tell	me	something	greater</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	a	single	rampaging	strain	of	microbe	was	at	work	here,	and	now,	seeing	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	the	animals	were	all	cooperating,	hearing	the	voice	reassure	me	they	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	fine	—	well,	I	didn’t	know	what	to	think. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	this	a	judgment?”	I	asked.	“Some	sort	of	punishment?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s	doing	the	punishing?”	I	demanded,	voice	shaking.	“And	why	wasn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	punished	along	with	everyone	else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again	no	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	drove	on,	knowing	I	would	receive	no	reply	to	my	questions. </p>

<p class="calibre1">SIX</p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 aunt	 and	 uncle’s	 house	 looked	 intact,	 Uncle	 Jeremy’s	 Beemer	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">driveway,	a	little	garden	flag	with	an	autumn	leaf	design	flapping	in	the	breeze</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 I	 got	 out	 of	 the	 Cherokee.	 The	 rest	 of	 the	 neighborhood	 looked	 similarly peaceful,	but	I	knew	better	than	to	trust	that	outward	appearance	of	tranquility.	I knew	what	it	hid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike	Elena’s	house,	the	front	door	here	was	locked.	I	wished	I	could	take</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 as	 a	 sign	 to	 turn	 around	 and	 go,	 but	 that	 would	 be	 the	 cowardly	 way	 out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead,	I	headed	toward	the	back,	to	the	entrance	that	opened	on	the	patio.	Their backyard	 wasn’t	 landscaped	 with	 grass	 and	 trees	 like	 ours,	 but	 was	 completely paved	over	except	for	some	plantings	along	the	edges,	with	a	pergola	to	protect</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 area	 to	 one	 side	 where	 they	 had	 the	 patio	 furniture	 and	 the	 barbecue.	 My hiking	boots	seemed	overly	loud	as	I	walked	across	the	flagstones	and	tested	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Locked.	I	knocked,	then	waited.	Nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knocked	again,	calling	out,	half	in	a	whisper,	“Uncle	Jeremy?	Aunt	Susan?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	reply,	but,	to	be	fair,	I	wasn’t	sure	if	I’d	been	loud	enough	for	anyone	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">really	 hear	 me	 inside.	 Maybe	 I’d	 kept	 my	 voice	 down	 because	 I	 wanted	 an excuse	not	to	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	tried	peeking	inside,	but	the	blinds	were	closed	almost	all	the	way,	and	so	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t	 really	 see	 anything.	 The	 planter	 next	 to	 me	 was	 bordered	 with	 large</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>rocks;	 I	 wondered	 if	 I	 should	 pick	 one	 up	 and	 smash	 a	 window	 in.	 Even	 if	 by some	miracle	someone	was	alive	inside,	I	didn’t	think	they’d	get	too	angry	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	breaking	a	window	to	check	on	them.	At	least,	I	hoped	they	wouldn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bending	down,	I	wrapped	my	fingers	around	one	of	the	rocks.	At	the	same</p>
<p class="calibre1">time,	the	voice	thundered	in	my	head,  <i class="calibre3">Behind	you! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	whirled,	rock	still	in	one	hand.	Standing	a	few	paces	away	was	probably	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">last	 person	 I’d	 expected	 to	 see	 —	 Chris	 Bowman,	 who	 lived	 next	 door	 to	 my aunt	 and	 uncle,	 and	 who	 I	 had	 always	 found	 extremely	 creepy.	 He	 was	 a	 few years	older	than	I	but	still	lived	at	home,	and	more	than	once	I’d	heard	my	aunt</p>
<p class="calibre1">say	“what	a	shame”	it	was	that	his	parents	had	to	deal	with	him,	but	I	never	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">able	to	find	out	exactly	what	she	meant	by	that.	I’d	always	assumed	Chris	maybe</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 a	 substance	 abuse	 problem,	 or	 possibly	 mental	 health	 issues.	 Frankly,	 I didn’t	want	to	get	close	enough	to	him	to	find	out,	as	it	seemed	that	every	time</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 family	 came	 to	 visit,	 he’d	 have	 some	 excuse	 to	 be	 outside,	 watering	 the flower	border	or	getting	the	mail	—	anything	so	he	could	stand	there	and	watch</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	with	his	pale	eyes	until	I	disappeared	inside	my	aunt	and	uncle’s	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back	 then,	 his	 behavior	 hadn’t	 worried	 me	 too	 much,	 because	 I	 knew	 if	 he actually	 tried	 anything,	 my	 father	 would	 have	 made	 sure	 it	 never	 happened again.	 But	 now,	 with	 the	 whole	 world	 dead	 except	 for	 me	 and	 Albuquerque’s biggest	creep? </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 fingers	 tightened	 around	 the	 rock	 I	 held,	 but	 I	 kept	 it	 behind	 me	 and hoped	 he	 hadn’t	 noticed	 as	 I	 picked	 it	 up.	 Hard	 to	 say,	 because	 I	 hadn’t	 even heard	him	approach.	He	was	wearing	his	typical	costume	of	baggy	jeans	and	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">oversized	T-shirt	—	this	one	emblazoned	with	a	Captain	America	shield	—	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 high-topped	 Converse	 apparently	 hadn’t	 made	 any	 sound	 as	 he	 crossed	 the flagstones	of	the	patio. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chris?”	I	finally	managed,	because	one	of	us	had	to	say	something,	and	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	he	was	content	to	just	stand	there	and	stare	at	me	with	those	weird	pale</p>
<p class="calibre1">blue	eyes	of	his. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	 his	 mouth	 curved	 in	 a	 smile.	 His	 teeth	 were	 slightly	 yellowish,	 as was	his	skin	and	hair.	Everything	about	him	seemed	vaguely	yellow,	except	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes.	“You’re	immune,”	he	said,	and	made	the	oddest	sound,	like	a	choked	little</p>
<p class="calibre1">giggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	hair	on	the	back	of	my	neck	stood	up.	“Maybe,”	I	replied.	“Or	maybe	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	haven’t	gotten	sick	yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 you’re	 immune.”	 His	 pale	 gaze	 raked	 me	 up	 and	 down,	 and	 I	 tensed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	clothes	I	wore	were	anything	but	revealing,	and	yet	the	way	he	was	looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	me	made	me	feel	as	if	I	wasn’t	wearing	anything	at	all…that	he’d	spent	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">too	much	time	imagining	what	I	looked	like	naked.	“Just	like	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a>I	wanted	to	retort,  <i class="calibre3">I	am	nothing	like	you</i>,	but	something	held	me	back.	Yes,	I had	 that	 rock	 in	 my	 hand.	 Belatedly,	 I	 realized	 that	 was	 all	 I	 had,	 since	 in	 my haste	to	get	out	of	the	car	and	up	to	my	aunt	and	uncle’s	front	door,	I’d	left	the gun	in	the	glove	compartment	of	the	Cherokee.	Shit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 is	 perfect,”	 he	 went	 on,	 his	 tone	 almost	 dreamy.	 “Everyone	 gone</p>
<p class="calibre1">except	you	and	me.	Just	the	way	I	always	wanted	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jesus	Christ.	I	could	feel	the	sharp	edges	of	the	rock	biting	into	my	fingers</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	palm.	If	I	threw	it,	would	it	be	enough	to	knock	him	out,	or	at	least	put	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	balance	enough	for	me	to	bolt	to	the	car?	I	had	no	idea.	Normally,	I’d	say	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	pretty	strong…but	was	I	strong	enough? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um,	Chris,”	I	said,	figuring	that	ignoring	his	comment	seemed	safest	in	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment,	“what	about	your	parents?	Your	neighbors	on	the	other	side?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	expression	of	annoyance	crossed	his	lumpy	features.	“I	 <i class="calibre3">told</i>	you.	They’re all	gone.	Everyone	on	the	whole	street.	I	checked.”	A	pause,	and	then	he	added, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	aunt	and	uncle,	too,	and	your	cousins.	I	went	in	and	looked,	then	locked</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	door	when	I	came	back	out.	I	figured	no	one	else	would	be	going	in	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 annoyed	 look	 morphed	 into	 one	 of	 sly	 knowing.	 “So	 you	 won’t	 need	 that rock	to	break	in.	Why	don’t	you	give	it	to	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	reply.	He	frowned,	taking	a	step	toward	me,	eyes	fixed	on	my	face, </p>
<p class="calibre1">greedy,	hungry.	A	pale	pink	tongue	darted	out	to	moisten	his	lips,	and	I	felt	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">stomach	heave. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Now,	Jessica! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	stopping	to	think,	I	whipped	my	arm	around	and	hurled	the	rock	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris’s	head	with	all	the	strength	I	possessed.	It	hit	him	square	in	the	temple,	and he	let	out	a	shocked	cry,	eyes	wide	and	disbelieving,	then	backed	away	from	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	blood	began	to	pour	through	the	fingers	he	put	up	against	the	wound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	the	only	opening	I	would	get,	I	knew.	I	tore	out	of	there,	bolting	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	someone	had	just	shot	off	a	starter	pistol	at	a	track	meet.	Behind	me,	I	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear	Chris	cursing,	calling	me	a	bitch	and	worse	—	but	he	was	also	coming	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">me.	And	though	he	was	soft-looking	and	most	likely	out	of	shape,	he	was	also</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost	 a	 foot	 taller	 than	 I,	 which	 meant	 his	 legs	 could	 cover	 the	 ground	 a	 lot more	quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	I	looked	back,	I’d	be	lost.	I	could	only	continue	to	pound	my	way	toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Cherokee,	one	hand	scrabbling	in	my	pants	pocket	for	the	key	as	I	ran.	My</p>
<p class="calibre1">fingers	 closed	 around	 the	 fob,	 and	 I	 hit	 the	 “unlock”	 button	 while	 I	 was	 still	 a good	twenty	feet	away.	The	lights	flashed,	and	from	the	passenger	seat	I	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear	Dutchie	bark	—	not	a	friendly	bark	of	greeting,	but	a	sharp,	strained	one,	as if	warning	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	cold,	clammy	hand	caught	hold	of	my	bicep	and	spun	me	around.	Chris’s</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>washed-out	blue	eyes,	even	more	blindingly	pale	now	that	they	were	circled	by bright	red	blood	flowing	down	from	the	gash	in	his	head,	bored	into	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	going	to	regret	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chris,	please	—	”	I	thought	I’d	been	scared	before,	watching	my	family	die, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wondering	when	the	fever	would	rise	up	to	consume	me	as	well,	but	that	was	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">entirely	different	species	of	fear	from	what	I	was	experiencing	now.	This	was	far</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	 personal,	 in	 a	 way,	 because	 I	 knew	 all	 too	 well	 what	 Chris	 Bowman wanted	from	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shut	up.”	His	fingers	tightened	on	my	arm,	and	he	began	to	pull	me	toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.	Overcome	by	panic,	I	struggled	against	him,	tasting	the	sourness	of	bile	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	mouth,	knowing	if	he	touched	me	in	a	way	that	was	any	more	intimate	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">this,	I	would	be	sick.	I	drove	my	knee	upward	the	way	my	father	had	taught	me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	hoped	I	could	catch	Chris	in	the	groin,	but	he	seemed	to	guess	what	I	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">planned	and	kicked	out	at	me,	catching	me	in	the	shin	and	sending	me	flying	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 ground,	 where	 I	 hit	 the	 sidewalk	 with	 a	 jolt,	 pain	 lancing	 up	 through	 my wrists	as	I	jammed	down	into	them	with	almost	all	my	weight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tears	of	pain	and	fury	leaped	to	my	eyes,	but	I	couldn’t	lose	it	now.	I	started</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 crawl	 toward	 the	 SUV,	 only	 to	 feel	 Chris’s	 hands	 on	 me	 again,	 this	 time around	my	waist.	I	kicked	back	at	him,	but	he	let	go	of	me	with	one	hand	so	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	catch	my	ankle	and	flip	me	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	was	 looming	over	me,	 his	horrific	bloodstained	 face	getting	closer</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 closer.	 I	 knew	 what	 he	 was	 going	 to	 do,	 and	 I	 knew	 I	 wouldn’t	 be	 able	 to stop	him	—	he	was	bigger	and	stronger,	and	just	plain	crazy,	and	I	now	had	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">least	one,	if	not	two,	sprained	wrists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then…then	 it	 was	 as	 if	 a	 pair	 of	 invisible	 hands	 caught	 hold	 of	 him, pulling	him	away	from	me,	flinging	him	backward	as	if	he	weighed	nothing,	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	a	child’s	toy	someone	had	left	out	on	the	lawn.	He	hit	the	trunk	of	the	palm</p>
<p class="calibre1">tree	 in	 my	 aunt	 and	 uncle’s	 yard	 with	 a	 sickening	 crunch,	 then	 slid	 down,	 his head	hanging	at	a	strange	angle.	Was	his	neck	broken?	No	way	was	I	going	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	close	enough	to	find	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 didn’t	 even	 realize	 I	 was	 saying	 the	 words	 out	 loud	 until	 I	 heard	 them coming	from	my	mouth.	“What	the	—	” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	voice	sounded	stern	and	sad.  <i class="calibre3">Do	you	see	now	why	I	did	not	want	you	to</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">come	here? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Point	 taken,”	 I	 panted,	 and	 got	 shakily	 to	 my	 feet.	 Both	 my	 wrists	 were aching,	and	I	hoped	I’d	be	able	to	get	the	Cherokee	home.	Not	that	I	had	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">choice.	It	was	the	only	safe	haven	I	knew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wincing,	I	dug	the	key	out	of	my	pocket	and	climbed	into	the	SUV,	trying	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">maneuver	with	my	elbows	so	I	wouldn’t	have	to	bend	my	wrists	any	more	than</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>was	strictly	necessary.	Dutchie	whined	and	tried	to	lick	my	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 okay,	 sweetie,”	 I	 told	 her,	 more	 for	 her	 sake	 than	 because	 I	 really believed	what	I	was	saying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trying	to	put	on	the	seatbelt	would	have	been	excruciating.	Besides,	with	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 wrecks	 littering	 the	 roads,	 I	 wouldn’t	 be	 driving	 much	 above	 twenty-five miles	an	hour	anyway.	Somehow	I	managed	to	get	the	car	started,	then	bit	my	lip</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	pain	as	I	put	the	Cherokee	in	gear.	At	least	I’d	been	parked	at	the	curb	and	not in	the	driveway,	so	I	didn’t	have	to	worry	about	backing	out	or	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	throbbing	ache	in	my	wrists	prevented	me	from	thinking	about	anything</p>
<p class="calibre1">except	getting	back	to	the	house.	I	drove	slowly,	grinding	my	teeth	whenever	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	to	maneuver	around	abandoned	cars	by	going	up	on	the	curb.	Every	jolt	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">jounce	felt	magnified	a	hundredfold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	 though,	 I	 made	 it	 back	 to	 my	 street	 and	 eased	 the	 car	 into	 the driveway,	 then	 turned	 off	 the	 engine.	 I	 knew	 there	 was	 no	 way	 I	 could	 reach across	 and	 open	 the	 passenger	 door	 from	 the	 inside,	 so	 I	 slid	 out	 and	 went around	the	front	of	the	SUV.	Dutchie	bounded	out	the	second	she	was	free	to	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">so,	and	I	retrieved	the	gun	from	the	glove	compartment	before	shutting	the	door</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind	her	and	clicking	the	lock	button	on	the	remote. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Limping,	since	I’d	realized	in	that	moment	just	how	much	my	right	knee	hurt</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	well,	I	went	in	through	the	back	door	and	locked	it	behind	me.	Then	I	headed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	front	of	the	house	to	test	the	lock	there	as	well.	All	was	as	it	should	be,	but I	couldn’t	stop	shaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dutchie	sat	in	the	living	room	and	watched	as	I	secured	the	house.	Then	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">tilted	her	head	toward	the	clock	over	the	fireplace,	as	if	to	say,  <i class="calibre3">It’s	lunchtime,	you</i> <i class="calibre3">know</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	everything,	I	couldn’t	help	giving	a	rusty	chuckle.	“Soon,	Dutchie.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">need	to	take	care	of	me	first.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	had	a	very	well-stocked	first	aid	kit	in	one	of	the	cupboards	in	the	service</p>
<p class="calibre1">porch.	 It	 hurt	 just	 to	 reach	 up	 and	 get	 it	 down,	 but	 I	 made	 myself	 do	 it.	 First	 I attended	to	the	superficial	scratches	on	the	palms	of	my	hands,	gritting	my	teeth</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	I	swabbed	them	with	alcohol	pads,	and	then	I	wrapped	both	wrists	with	Ace</p>
<p class="calibre1">bandages.	 They	 still	 ached,	 but	 not	 as	 badly.	 My	 knee	 was	 banged	 up,	 but	 I hadn’t	torn	my	jeans,	so	I	figured	any	bruises	I’d	gotten	would	heal	on	their	own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Afterward,	 I	 limped	 into	 the	 kitchen	 and	 got	 Dutchie	 some	 more	 chicken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides	the	leftover	dog	biscuits,	there	was	also	a	partial	bag	of	dry	dog	food	in the	 pantry	 that	 I	 could	 feed	 her,	 but	 I	 figured	 I	 might	 as	 well	 get	 rid	 of	 the perishable	stuff	first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 it	 was	 some	 water	 for	 me,	 and	 a	 makeshift	 sandwich	 of	 wheat	 bread and	 butter	 and	 the	 last	 of	 the	 strawberry	 jelly.	 My	 hand	 shook	 as	 I	 lifted	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>sandwich	 to	 my	 mouth,	 but	 I	 made	 myself	 eat	 anyway.	 That	 burst	 of	 panic,	 of terror,	had	used	up	a	lot	of	my	reserves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	silence	in	the	house	seemed	to	press	on	my	ears.	I	noticed	the	voice	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	suspiciously	quiet	since	I’d	returned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	I	set	down	my	water	bottle	and	snapped,	“All	right,	you	want	to	tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	what	the	hell	 <i class="calibre3">that</i>	was	all	about?	How	can	a	pasty	creep	like	Chris	Bowman be	immune	when	everyone	else	is	dead?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	 reply	 at	 first.	 Then	 it	 was	 as	 if	 someone	 sighed	 quietly,	 far	 back	 in	 my mind.  <i class="calibre3">We	 cannot	 control	 who	 is	 immune,	 only	 what	 happens	 to	 them	 after	 they</i> <i class="calibre3">have	survived. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘We’?”	I	demanded,	figuring	I’d	ask	the	most	pressing	question	first.	“Who</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	‘we’?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	resulting	silence	was	so	drawn	out	that	I	was	fairly	certain	I	wouldn’t	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	reply,	that	I’d	asked	exactly	the	wrong	question.	Finally,	the	voice	said,  <i class="calibre3">That	is</i> <i class="calibre3">not	important. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	important	to	me.”	I	hurt	all	over,	and	I	was	tired	of	the	sense	I’d	begun</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	have	that	something	huge	was	behind	all	this,	something	I	wasn’t	sure	I’d	ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	able	to	understand.	“Who	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	time	the	answer	came	back	almost	at	once.  <i class="calibre3">I	am	not	at	liberty	to	say. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">That	answer	only	made	the	impotent	rage	within	me	burn	all	the	hotter.	This</p>
<p class="calibre1">last	evasion	was	about	all	I	could	take	at	the	moment.	“What	the	hell	is	this	—	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">White	House	press	conference?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">You	 are	 upset.	 This	 is	 understandable.	 But	 tell	 me	 —	 have	 I	 not	 done</i> <i class="calibre3">whatever	I	could	to	protect	you? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 recalled	 how	 Chris	 Bowman	 had	 been	 torn	 away	 from	 me	 by	 invisible</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands,	thrown	up	against	that	palm	tree	as	if	he	weighed	nothing,	even	though	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	six	feet,	two	inches	of	solid	pudge.	“Was	that	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">My	only	wish	is	for	your	safety.	That	is	why	you	need	to	leave	this	place	and</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">go	north. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">So	we	were	back	to	that	again.	I	had	to	admit,	after	this	morning’s	events,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	a	little	more	open	to	the	idea	of	getting	the	hell	out	of	Albuquerque	and	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking	 back.	 Part	 of	 me	 —	 the	 stubborn	 part	 —	 still	 wanted	 to	 go	 to	 Tori’s house,	 to	 see	 for	 myself	 what	 had	 happened	 to	 her	 and	 her	 family.	 But	 I	 also knew	I	was	putting	myself	at	risk	every	time	I	set	foot	out	the	door.	A	great	deal of	the	population	had	vanished	during	the	previous	three	days,	but	not	all	of	it…</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	it	was	those	remnants	I	had	to	worry	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,”	I	said	wearily.	“I’ll	think	about	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	 I	 was	 only	 talking	 to	 myself.	 Right	 then,	 I	 didn’t	 want	 to	 think	 too hard	about	the	whole	insane	situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 afternoon	 I	 dozed	 a	 little,	 and	 when	 I	 woke	 up,	 I	 actually	 felt	 better.	 My wrists	 didn’t	 ache	 as	 much,	 and	 the	 abrasions	 on	 my	 hands	 already	 looked completely	scabbed	over.	What	the	hell?	Was	this	part	of	the	“voice”	—	I	didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">know	 how	 else	 to	 think	 of	 him,	 or	 it	 —	 watching	 over	 me?	 Did	 he	 have	 some way	of	making	me	heal	far	faster	than	I	normally	would? </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	any	other	time,	I	would	have	dismissed	the	notion	as	crazy,	but	so	many</p>
<p class="calibre1">insane	 things	 had	 happened	 since	 Monday	 that	 I	 couldn’t	 reject	 any	 of	 them outright.	 Maybe	 my	 particular	 immunity	 brought	 with	 it	 certain	 other	 benefits, although	 I	 couldn’t	 begin	 to	 think	 how	 that	 worked.	 I’d	 always	 been	 a	 healthy person,	so	I	bounced	back	from	bumps	and	bruises	and	sprains	fairly	quickly	—</p>
<p class="calibre1">but	not	this	quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Putting	that	conundrum	aside	to	ponder	at	a	later	date,	I	decided	to	take	stock</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	what	I	had	in	the	house,	and	what	else	I	would	need	in	the	way	of	supplies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	had	a	good	deal	of	camping	gear,	so	I	was	set	when	it	came	to	sleeping	bags</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	Coleman	lanterns	and	all	that	sort	of	stuff.	The	first	aid	kit	was	stocked	well enough	for	ordinary	scrapes	and	bruises	and	strains,	but	I	wondered	if	I	should</p>
<p class="calibre1">hit	 up	 a	 few	 of	 the	 local	 pharmacies	 and	 get	 myself	 antibiotics,	 some	 kind	 of painkillers,	cough	and	cold	medicine…a	decent	supply	of	my	birth	control	pills. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	that	I	was	expecting	to	get	laid	anytime	soon	—	Chris	Bowman’s	bloodied</p>
<p class="calibre1">face	flashed	into	my	mind,	and	I	shuddered	—	but	the	pills	did	help	to	keep	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">periods	 manageable.	 And	 that	 was	 another	 thing.	 I’d	 need	 sanitary	 supplies, enough	to	last	me	for	a	while.	Making	do	with	rags	the	way	they	did	in	the	bad</p>
<p class="calibre1">old	days	was	not	something	I	wanted	to	face	quite	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Night	 began	 to	 fall	 again,	 and	 I	 moved	 around	 the	 ground	 floor,	 lighting candles.	I	still	didn’t	want	to	go	upstairs,	for	some	reason	felt	safer	here	on	the couch.	I	fed	Dutchie	the	last	of	the	chicken,	and	snacked	on	a	couple	of	granola</p>
<p class="calibre1">bars,	trying	to	ignore	how	much	my	body	ached	for	something	more	substantial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wasn’t	quite	at	the	point	of	being	willing	to	kill	for	a	cheeseburger,	but	I	could see	myself	heading	down	that	road	in	a	couple	of	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 spoke	 into	 the	 stillness	 of	 the	 house.	 “So	 if	 I’m	 supposed	 to	 head	 north, where	exactly	am	I	going?	Santa	Fe?	Taos?	Colorado?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Go	north,	and	I	will	guide	you	where	you	need	to	go. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	not	an	answer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">It’s	all	the	answer	you	require. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>“You’re	a	real	pain	in	the	ass,	you	know	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	 that	 might	 have	 been	 a	 chuckle.  <i class="calibre3">I	 have	 been	 told	 that	 on</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">occasion,	if	not	in	those	precise	words. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you’re	still	not	going	to	tell	me	where	I’m	going.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">No. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	at	least	he	was	being	honest.	I’d	begun	thinking	of	the	voice	as	“him,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">although	it	still	could	have	been	merely	a	product	of	my	fevered	imagination,	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 mind	 that	 couldn’t	 handle	 all	 the	 death	 and	 destruction	 around	 it,	 and	 so	 had slipped	into	a	nice,	cozy	form	of	psychosis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	so,	but	that	didn’t	explain	the	way	Chris	Bowman	had	been	torn	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	me,	as	if	some	invisible	giant	had	grabbed	him	and	thrown	him	across	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">yard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Telekinesis?	Some	kind	of	delayed-onset	 <i class="calibre3">X-Men</i>	action? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Okay,	now	I	was	beginning	to	sound	ridiculous	even	to	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,”	I	said.	“I’m	convinced.	Mostly	because	I’m	not	sure	that	creeper</p>
<p class="calibre1">doesn’t	know	where	I	live…if	he’s	still	alive.”	A	pause	then,	while	I	waited	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 voice	 to	 break	 in	 and	 tell	 me	 that	 oh,	 yes,	 Chris	 Bowman	 was	 dead,	 and	 I needn’t	worry	about	him	any	longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	heard	no	such	thing,	just	a	silence	that	began	to	echo	in	my	ears.	Great. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	apparently	Mr.	Bowman	wasn’t	exactly	down	for	the	count. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	in	a	breath	and	plunged	ahead.	“And	anyway,	staying	here	is	starting</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 sound	 less	 and	 less	 attractive.	 I’ll	 head	 out	 in	 the	 morning	 after	 I	 get	 some more	supplies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">You	won’t	need	them. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	said	flatly,	as	if	he	didn’t	expect	me	to	contradict	him.	“Well,	sorry, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	since	you	won’t	tell	me	where	I’m	going	or	how	long	the	journey	is	going	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">take,	I	need	to	be	prepared.	And	that	means	getting	a	few	things.	I’ll	be	careful.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The	way	you	were	careful	at	your	aunt	and	uncle’s	house? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Bristling,	 I	 replied,	 “Okay,	 I	 was	 caught	 off	 guard.	 That’s	 not	 going	 to happen	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	 reply.	 I	 wasn’t	 sure	 whether	 that	 meant	 the	 voice	 had	 run	 out	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">arguments	 to	 give	 me,	 or	 whether	 it	 was	 simply	 tired	 of	 me	 throwing	 up roadblocks.	 I	 decided	 to	 take	 its	 silence	 as	 tacit	 agreement	 with	 my	 plan.	 And really,	it	shouldn’t	be	that	big	a	deal.	The	Walgreens	I	frequented	was	less	than	a mile	from	my	house.	I’d	pack	everything	else	I	needed	in	advance,	then	go	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 my	 way	 out	 of	 town.	 Surely	 the	 voice	 couldn’t	 have	 any	 real	 problem	 with that? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	probably	could,	but	unless	it	woke	me	up	in	the	middle	of	the	night	to	tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	everything	I	was	doing	wrong,	I	was	going	with	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Falling	 asleep	 that	 night	 was	 difficult.	 The	 silence	 rattled	 me;	 every	 creak	 and sigh	 of	 the	 house	 contracting	 as	 the	 night	 air	 grew	 colder	 made	 me	 startle, thinking	 Chris	 the	 Creeper	 had	 returned	 to	 finish	 what	 he’d	 started	 outside	 my aunt	 and	 uncle’s	 house.	 Well,	 the	 joke	 would	 be	 on	 him	 —	 I	 had	 the	 revolver right	 next	 to	 me	 on	 the	 coffee	 table,	 and	 had	 gotten	 the	 shotgun	 from	 the	 gun safe	and	was	lying	with	it	propped	up	against	the	arm	of	the	sofa	near	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	be	a	red	smear	on	the	wall	before	he	had	time	to	blink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	the	guns	didn’t	reassure	me	as	much	as	I’d	thought	they	would.	Maybe	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	more	that	I’d	begun	to	pick	at	what	the	voice	had	said	to	me,	how	he’d	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	“we”	—	meaning	him	and	others	like	him,	I	supposed,	whatever	or	whoever</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	were	—	hadn’t	controlled	who	lived	and	who	died	of	the	Heat,	but	that	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">did	 have	 some	 say	 in	 what	 happened	 to	 the	 survivors.	 That	 was	 a	 frightening thought.	True,	everything	he’d	done	so	far	seemed	to	have	been	for	my	benefit…</p>
<p class="calibre1">but	why? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	realized	he	hadn’t	called	me	“beloved”	for	a	while.	Was	that	an	oversight, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or	had	all	my	questions	and	my	ignoring	of	his	advice	annoyed	him	enough	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wasn’t	quite	so	beloved	anymore?	The	thought	bothered	me	a	little…but	not	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	 as	 contemplating	 what	 it	 might	 mean	 to	 be	 the	 beloved	 of	 some</p>
<p class="calibre1">incorporeal	being	who	spoke	to	me	only	in	my	thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 he	 was	 even	 real.	 I	 really	 could	 just	 be	 imagining	 the	 whole	 thing.	 After all,	 there	 were	 accounts	 of	 mothers	 going	 ballistic	 and	 lifting	 trucks	 off	 their toddlers	 or	 whatever.	 Wasn’t	 it	 possible	 that	 I’d	 been	 the	 one	 to	 fling	 Chris Bowman	 away	 from	 me,	 and	 my	 mind	 had	 just	 embellished	 the	 event	 so	 it seemed	as	if	some	kind	of	supernatural	force	was	involved? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 didn’t	 know.	 And	 the	 worst	 part	 was,	 I	 had	 no	 one	 to	 talk	 to	 about	 my situation,	 except	 a	 disembodied	 voice	 that	 might	 or	 might	 not	 be	 merely	 a figment	of	my	imagination.	For	most	of	the	day,	I’d	managed	to	push	to	one	side</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	pain	of	losing	my	family,	my	friends,	but	now	as	I	sat	there	in	the	dark,	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">candle	flickering	on	the	coffee	table,	it	all	seemed	to	come	back	in	a	rush,	like	a great,	 gaping	 wound	 in	 my	 middle	 where	 my	 heart	 had	 been	 torn	 out.	 I	 was twenty-four	years	old,	but	right	then	all	I	wanted	was	my	mother.	I	wanted	her	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">hug	me	and	tell	me	it	was	all	going	to	be	okay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then	I	felt	him	there,	as	I	had	earlier,	like	a	wash	of	warmth	moving	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">me,	strong	arms	around	me,	the	touch	of	an	unseen	mouth	against	my	tumbled</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>hair.  <i class="calibre3">Ah,	 beloved,	 you	 do	 not	 believe	 me	 now,	 but	 it	 will	 get	 better.	 Sleep	 now,</i> <i class="calibre3">and	leave	the	pain	for	another	day. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	opened	my	mouth	to	speak,	but	I	found	I	didn’t	have	the	strength	to	form</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	 words.	 Instead,	 darkness	 washed	 over	 me,	 taking	 me	 along	 with	 it.	 In	 that moment,	I	knew	I	lacked	the	strength	to	fight	the	inevitable. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a><img src="index-73_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="index-73_2.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">SEVEN</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dutchie’s	growling	woke	me.	I	startled	awake,	sitting	bolt	upright	and	blinking</p>
<p class="calibre1">against	 the	 darkness.	 Only	 it	 wasn’t	 completely	 dark,	 as	 the	 pillar	 candle	 still burned	 bravely	 in	 its	 dish	 on	 the	 coffee	 table.	 Thank	 God	 for	 that,	 because	 the dog	was	sitting	in	front	of	the	door,	teeth	bared	in	a	snarl,	a	deep,	bone-rattling growl	rumbling	within	her	throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	 thinking,	 I	 pushed	 back	 the	 blankets	 that	 covered	 me	 and	 grabbed the	 shotgun.	 Yes,	 the	 .357	 had	 great	 stopping	 power,	 but	 I	 knew	 anything	 I	 hit with	that	shotgun	would	go	down	and	stay	down.	Well,	except	for	the	parts	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">got	splattered	on	any	nearby	walls.	And	if	I	did	somehow	manage	to	miss,	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Remington	would	make	a	pretty	decent	club. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 heart	 was	 hammering	 away	 in	 my	 chest,	 but	 I	 made	 myself	 go	 to	 the peephole	in	the	front	door	and	attempt	to	peer	out.	Fat	lot	of	good	that	did	—	the night	outside	was	pitch	black,	with	not	a	hint	of	a	moon.	I	couldn’t	even	see	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rose	of	Sharon	bushes	on	either	side	of	the	doorway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	the	whole	time	Dutchie	didn’t	stop	growling,	although	as	I	backed	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 the	 door,	 shotgun	 still	 clenched	 in	 my	 right	 hand,	 she	 moved	 as	 well, padding	toward	the	back	of	the	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Great.	 The	 front	 door	 was	 much	 bigger	 and	 heavier	 than	 the	 back	 door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyone	sufficiently	motivated	could	kick	in	the	door	off	the	service	porch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 had	 a	 feeling	 that	 if	 he	 was	 still	 ambulatory,	 Chris	 Bowman	 would	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>feeling	 really	 motivated	 right	 around	 now.	 Maybe	 I	 was	 just	 being	 paranoid, since	I	had	no	idea	how	he	could	have	even	found	me.	We	weren’t	exactly	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	could	call	listed	in	the	phone	book;	cops	tended	to	be	circumspect	about	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">sort	of	thing.	Then	again,	Chris	seemed	like	the	type	who	might	have	mastered</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 finer	 points	 of	 hacking	 into	 secure	 databases,	 and	 considering	 his	 apparent obsession	with	me…. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dutchie	trotted	ahead	of	me.	Her	ears	were	up,	nose	pointed	directly	toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	service	porch	at	the	rear	of	the	kitchen.	And	that	was	when	I	heard	it,	too	—</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 faint	 scratching	 noise	 coming	 from	 the	 back	 door.	 If	 I	 hadn’t	 known	 better,	 I would	have	thought	it	was	one	of	the	other	neighborhood	dogs	trying	to	get	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 after	 seeing	 that	 whole	 “peaceable	 kingdom”	 bit	 at	 the	 PetSmart	 up	 in Sandia	Heights,	I	knew	Dutchie	wouldn’t	be	growling	like	that	if	it	was	simply</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	dog	on	the	other	side	of	that	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	already	loaded	the	shotgun	before	I	lay	down	to	sleep,	so	all	I	had	to	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	pump	it	to	bring	a	shell	into	the	chamber.	Even	though	I	could	feel	my	heart</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	 wailing	 away	 in	 my	 chest,	 I	 managed	 to	 call	 out	 in	 what	 sounded	 like	 a reasonably	steady	voice,	“Whoever	that	is,	back	away.	I’m	armed,	and	I	will	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">hesitate	to	shoot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There.	My	father	would’ve	been	proud,	if	he’d	been	around	to	hear	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	reply,	of	course.	Dutchie	sat	down	on	her	haunches,	then	looked	up	at	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	gave	a	questioning	whine.	It	seemed	obvious	she	thought	she’d	done	her	job</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 warning	 me	 that	 something	 was	 out	 there,	 and	 now	 it	 was	 my	 turn	 to	 do something	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	unreasonable	of	her,	but	no	way	was	I	going	to	reach	out	and	open	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">door.	If	I	had	to	stay	here	all	night	with	the	shotgun	pointed	at	the	back	entrance to	the	house,	I	would. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	odd	scratching	noise	started	up	again.	I	gritted	my	teeth,	wondering	if	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">should	send	off	a	warning	shot.	But	all	that	would	do	was	mess	up	the	back	door, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 what	 if	 that	 scratching	 noise	 was	 coming	 from	 an	 ambitious	 rat	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1">something?	 I’d	 look	 like	 an	 idiot,	 and	 worse,	 I	 would’ve	 completely</p>
<p class="calibre1">compromised	my	home’s	security. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	dragged	out	the	step	stool	and	sat	down	on	it,	shotgun	still	pointed	toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 back	 door.	 Dutchie	 stayed	 where	 she	 was,	 although	 she	 did	 send	 me	 an inquiring	look	over	one	shoulder.	I	shook	my	head	at	her,	and	she	settled	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 a	 sphinx-like	 position,	 still	 at	 attention,	 snout	 in	 a	 direct	 line	 with	 the doorknob.	 In	 that	 moment,	 I	 wondered	 whether	 I	 should	 even	 be	 trusting</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dutchie’s	instincts.	Obviously,	she	was	a	very	good	dog,	but	she	wasn’t	 <i class="calibre3">my</i>	dog. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	know	if	she	was	a	great	watch	dog	or	the	type	to	go	off	half-cocked	at</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>every	random	sound.	Yes,	there	was	something	outside,	but	it	didn’t	necessarily have	to	be	anything	threatening.	For	all	I	knew,	it	could	have	been	a	branch	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 willow	 bush	 just	 outside	 the	 back	 stoop	 scratching	 on	 the	 doorframe	 or something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	then	the	door	creaked	open,	and	my	breath	caught	in	my	throat.	Standing</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	 was	 Chris	 Bowman,	 face	 puffed	 and	 bruised,	 pale	 eyes	 glaring	 at	 me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	glinted	in	one	hand,	reflecting	the	faint	light	from	the	jar	candle	I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">left	lit	in	the	kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lock	picks.	Son	of	a	bitch.	Trust	a	maladjusted	bastard	like	Chris	the	Creep</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	know	how	to	pick	locks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly,	I	got	to	my	feet,	the	gun	still	trained	on	him.	“Get	out,	Chris.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 eyes	 were	 still	 fixed	 on	 my	 face,	 as	 if	 he	 hadn’t	 even	 registered	 the Remington	 pump-action	 shotgun	 in	 my	 hands.	 “No.	 We’re	 the	 only	 survivors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’re	meant	to	be	together.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	finger	was	resting	on	the	trigger.	Just	the	slightest	squeeze,	and	he’d	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">splatter	 on	 the	 doorframe.	 Could	 I	 kill	 someone,	 though,	 just	 like	 that?	 Before, when	I’d	thrown	the	rock	at	his	head,	I’d	only	meant	to	slow	him	down,	to	give</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself	 enough	 time	 to	 get	 safely	 away.	 The	 shotgun	 was	 an	 entirely	 different story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	want	to	hurt	you,	Chris,”	I	said,	forcing	my	voice	to	remain	steady, </p>
<p class="calibre1">just	as	I	willed	my	hands	not	to	shake	as	I	gripped	the	shotgun.	“The	two	of	us</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	 immune?	 It’s	 just	 an	 accident	 of	 biology.	 It	 doesn’t	 mean	 anything.	 So please,	go	back	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	the	first	time,	he	glanced	away	from	my	eyes,	down	at	the	gun	I	held.	A</p>
<p class="calibre1">look	 of	 almost	 comical	 confusion	 passed	 over	 his	 puffy	 features.	 “But	 I	  <i class="calibre3">want</i> you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	stomach	twisted,	and	right	then	I	was	glad	I	hadn’t	eaten	anything	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	that	bread	and	jelly	sandwich	a	few	hours	earlier…or	whenever	it	had	been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wasn’t	wearing	a	watch,	and	of	course	the	digital	clocks	on	the	appliances	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	kitchen	had	died	along	with	everything	else	when	the	power	went	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	don’t	want	you,	Chris,”	I	said,	and	right	then	my	voice	did	contain	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">betraying	 tremor	 that	 I	 hated,	 although	 I	 couldn’t	 do	 anything	 about	 it.	 “I	 told you,	I	don’t	want	to	hurt	you.	But	I	will.	My	dad	was	a	cop,	and	he	taught	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">how	to	use	this.	And	I	will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">During	this	little	speech,	Chris’s	eyes	grew	narrower	and	narrower,	as	if	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 finally	 processing	 my	 rejection	 of	 him.	 His	 lip	 curled,	 and	 he	 said,	 “You don’t	have	the	guts,”	right	before	he	lunged	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	thinking,	I	let	my	finger	jerk	on	the	trigger.	At	the	same	time,	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	if	a	powerful	hand	had	grasped	the	barrel,	pointing	it	away	from	Chris	so	all	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>did	was	blow	a	hole	in	the	ceiling,	destroying	the	combination	light/fan	fixture there	 and	 raining	 drywall	 everywhere.	 I	 blinked,	 sure	 the	 creep	 was	 going	 to come	after	me,	now	that	I’d	missed	so	heinously,	but	instead	something	seemed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 grab	 him	 by	 the	 neck,	 squeezing	 so	 his	 eyes	 began	 to	 bulge	 and	 his	 feet scrabbled	helplessly	against	the	linoleum	of	the	laundry	room	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 few	 gurgling	 moans	 came	 from	 his	 throat,	 and	 then	 once	 again	 he	 was flung	 away	 from	 me,	 this	 time	 with	 so	 much	 force	 that	 he	 flew	 across	 the backyard,	 hitting	 the	 corner	 of	 the	 garage	 before	 tumbling	 in	 a	 heap	 into	 the irises	 that	 still	 half-heartedly	 grew	 there.	 Shaking,	 I	 tightened	 my	 hold	 on	 the shotgun	and	started	down	the	back	steps	toward	him,	only	to	hear	the	voice	say, </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Stop,	Jessica.	There	is	no	need. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	paused	on	the	bottom	stair.	“That	—	that	was	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Yes</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	he’s	—	” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Yes.	I	did	what	I	should	have	done	back	at	your	aunt	and	uncle’s	house. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">My	breath	seemed	to	go	out	of	me	in	a	 <i class="calibre3">whoosh</i>,	 and	 I	 found	 myself	 sitting down	hard	on	the	step,	the	concrete	cold	even	through	my	jeans.	Thank	God	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">least	I’d	gone	to	bed	fully	dressed,	except	for	my	hiking	boots.	I	looked	over	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	gun	I	still	held. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wouldn’t	have	missed,	would	I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">No.	You	would	have	killed	him,	had	I	not	pushed	the	gun	away.	I	did	not	want</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">that	on	your	conscience. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">So…a	 being	 who	 would	 go	 out	 of	 his	 way	 to	 protect	 me,	 but	 didn’t	 think twice	 about	 killing	 someone	 else.	 Not	 that	 Chris	 Bowman	 was	 exactly	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">wonderful	specimen	of	humanity,	one	worth	saving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	an	angel?”	I	asked	abruptly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	of	those	low	chuckles.  <i class="calibre3">Hardly.	But	you	are	safe	now,	so	you	should</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">go	back	inside	and	try	to	sleep. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	seriously	expect	me	to	sleep	after	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Yes.	You	are	safe	now.	No	one	else	knows	of	your	presence	in	this	house.	You</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">can	sleep	here,	and	then	leave	tomorrow	morning. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 knew	 I’d	 exhausted	 all	 my	 arguments.	 After	 pushing	 myself	 to	 my	 feet,	 I glanced	 over	 toward	 where	 Chris	 Bowman’s	 body	 lay,	 twisted	 and	 limp	 in	 the ruin	of	what	was	once	my	mother’s	prized	bed	of	irises. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I	will	take	care	of	that.	Go	to	sleep,	Jessica. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Bowing	my	head,	I	nodded,	then	went	back	inside	and	locked	the	door.	Even</p>
<p class="calibre1">though	the	voice	had	told	me	I	was	safe,	I	still	took	the	step	stool	and	wedged	it up	under	the	knob	of	the	back	door.	Maybe	it	was	a	foolish	gesture,	but	it	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	feel	a	little	bit	better. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a>Dutchie	 looked	 up	 at	 me	 and	 wagged	 her	 tail,	 teeth	 showing	 in	 a	 doggy smile.	“Okay,”	I	said.	“You	get	a	treat	for	the	warning.”	I	got	out	a	dog	biscuit</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	gave	it	to	her	before	heading	back	to	my	makeshift	bed	on	the	living	room</p>
<p class="calibre1">couch,	where	I	leaned	the	shotgun	up	against	the	sofa’s	arm	once	more.	Maybe	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wouldn’t	need	it,	but	I	knew	I’d	sleep	better	if	it	was	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Assuming	I	slept	at	all,	of	course. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 did,	 finally,	 and	 awoke	 to	 bright	 sunshine	 peeking	 around	 the	 edges	 of	 the living	room	curtains.	The	clock	above	the	fireplace	was	battery-operated,	and	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	no	problem	telling	me	that	the	time	was	ten	minutes	until	eight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 I’d	 laid	 my	 head	 down	 on	 the	 sofa	 pillow	 the	 night	 before,	 I	 had	 no idea	 I’d	 sleep	 in	 that	 much.	 The	 confrontation	 with	 Chris	 Bowman	 must	 have taken	more	out	of	me	than	I	thought.	Speaking	of	which…. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	pushing	the	blankets	covering	me	off	to	one	side,	I	rose	and	padded	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">sock	 feet	 to	 the	 back	 door.	 The	 step	 stool	 was	 still	 there,	 shoved	 up	 under	 the doorknob.	I	removed	it	and	set	it	to	lean	against	the	wall,	then	opened	the	door</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 looked	 outside,	 toward	 the	 garage.	 The	 bright	 morning	 sunlight	 clearly revealed	the	clump	of	smashed	iris	plants	where	Chris	Bowman	had	landed	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">night	before,	but	his	body	was	gone.	No	blood,	no	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 I	 looked	 more	 closely,	 would	 there	 be	 a	 pile	 of	 ashes	 half	 hidden	 among the	 blade-like	 iris	 leaves?	 But	 no,	 he’d	 died	 from	 severe	 head	 trauma,	 not	 the Heat.	The	body	had	been	simply…taken	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deciding	it	was	best	not	to	contemplate	exactly	how	that	had	happened…or</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	 had	 been	 done	 with	 him…I	 went	 back	 inside	 and	 poured	 Dutchie	 some fresh	water	from	one	of	the	bottles	in	the	pantry,	and	gave	her	a	good	helping	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">dry	dog	food.	She	wolfed	it	down,	tail	wagging	the	whole	time,	so	obviously	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">hadn’t	been	irrevocably	scarred	by	the	events	of	the	night	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wasn’t	sure	I	could	say	the	same	for	myself,	but	I	had	other	things	I	needed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 focus	 on.	 The	 day	 before,	 I’d	 told	 the	 voice	 I	 would	 pack	 up	 and	 leave	 this morning,	 so	 that’s	 what	 I	 needed	 to	 do	 —	 assess	 what	 I	 would	 take	 with	 me, based	 on	 how	 much	 I	 could	 fit	 into	 the	 Cherokee.	 With	 the	 back	 seats	 folded down,	I	really	could	haul	a	good	deal	of	gear,	so	I	didn’t	think	space	would	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">too	much	of	a	problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a>More	bread	and	butter	for	breakfast,	supplemented	with	some	dried	apricots	I found	 smashed	 into	 one	 corner	 of	 the	 pantry.	 My	 mother	 had	 been	 a	 very organized	 woman,	 but	 Devin	 was	 a	 source	 of	 chaos	 that	 could	 defeat	 even	 the most	 orderly	 person.	 I	 started	 stacking	 what	 was	 salvageable	 on	 the	 breakfast bar:	the	rest	of	that	bag	of	apricots,	a	pile	of	granola	bars,	an	unopened	bag	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">blue	corn	chips,	the	remnants	of	the	dry	food	and	the	dog	biscuits	for	Dutchie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	would	get	us	started,	and	I	figured	I	could	always	stock	up	on	a	few	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">things	in	the	food	section	of	the	Walgreens. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Truly,	 you	 do	 not	 need	 that	 much. </i>	 The	 voice	 sounded	 almost	 amused	 this time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	until	you’re	telling	me	how	far	I’m	driving,	I’m	going	to	over-pack,”	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">said,	setting	the	half-used	flat	of	bottled	water	next	to	the	dog	food. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Jessica,	do	you	not	like	surprises? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	particularly,	no.”	I	surveyed	the	meager	pile	and	thought	I	really	wasn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">overdoing	 it	 by	 anyone’s	 standards.	 True,	 I	 could	 start	 piling	 up	 the	 economy-sized	 cans	 of	 tomato	 sauce	 and	 beans	 my	 mother	 had	 bought	 at	 Costco,	 but	 I could	get	that	stuff	anywhere	if	necessary.	It	wasn’t	as	if	there	was	going	to	be	a lot	of	competition	for	the	enormous	stockpiles	of	canned	food	left	behind	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mostly	deceased	people	of	New	Mexico. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Well,	I	think	you	will	like	this	surprise. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	 that	 reply	 just	 annoyed	 me	 —	 what	 was	 I,	 five?	 —	 I	 made	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">noncommittal	 sound	 in	 my	 throat	 and	 headed	 out	 the	 back	 door,	 up	 to	 my apartment.	This	time,	Dutchie	didn’t	seem	too	inclined	to	follow	me.	I	guessed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	reason	why	when	I	saw	her	nose	around	the	backyard,	then	squat	to	pee.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">second	 movement,	 so	 to	 speak,	 would	 probably	 follow	 shortly,	 but	 I	 didn’t	 see any	need	to	hang	around	for	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	 an	 idiot,	 I’d	 left	 the	 door	 to	 my	 apartment	 unlocked,	 but,	 as	 far	 as	 I could	 tell,	 Chris	 hadn’t	 made	 it	 up	 here.	 It	 was	 possible	 that	 he’d	 detected	 the faint	glow	of	the	candles	from	inside	the	main	house	and	realized	that	was	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	bunked	down.	Just	as	well,	because	I	didn’t	know	if	I	could	have	brought	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	my	belongings	with	me	if	I’d	known	he’d	pawed	through	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 my	 closet	 I	 had	 one	 of	 those	 airline-regulation	 hard-sided	 suitcases,	 the kind	 with	 wheels,	 as	 well	 as	 two	 largish	 duffle	 bags.	 I	 filled	 one	 of	 the	 duffle bags	with	underwear	and	bras	and	socks,	along	with	a	couple	of	sleep	shirts.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	 duffle	 bag	 got	 shoe-carrying	 duty	 —	 which	 turned	 out	 not	 to	 be	 much, since	I	only	packed	my	trail	shoes,	a	pair	of	knee-high	boots	with	rubber	soles, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	one	pair	of	flip-flops.	And…well,	I	didn’t	see	where	I	would	ever	wear	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">again,	 but	 I	 didn’t	 want	 to	 leave	 behind	 my	 pretty	 black	 flats	 with	 the	 scallop detail,	 or	 the	 high-heeled	 sandals	 with	 the	 jeweled	 embellishment.	 Maybe	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>could	 just	 take	 them	 out	 from	 time	 to	 time	 and	 fondle	 them.	 I	 loved	 those sandals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	filled	up	the	remainder	of	the	duffle	bag	with	my	toiletries,	although	I	left</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind	 all	 the	 hair-prep	 tools.	 What	 was	 the	 point,	 when	 there	 was	 no	 more electricity?	 Maybe	 if	 I	 got	 really	 bored	 I’d	 invent	 a	 solar-powered	 blow	 dryer, but	in	the	meantime,	that	was	a	whole	lot	of	stuff	I	didn’t	need	to	drag	along. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	the	same	no-nonsense	approach	with	my	clothes:	jeans	and	T-shirts	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">both	short-	and	long-sleeved	varieties,	a	flannel	shirt	I’d	inherited	from	my	ex-</p>
<p class="calibre1">boyfriend	(he	was	an	ass,	but	that	shirt	was	soooo	soft),	the	all-weather	anorak	I used	when	going	on	hikes.	If	I	really	was	going	north,	I’d	need	some	protection, </p>
<p class="calibre1">so	 I	 added	 my	 dark	 green	 plaid	 cashmere	 scarf	 and	 lined	 leather	 gloves	 to	 the pile,	along	with	the	black	knitted	cap	that	Elena	had	once	complained	made	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">look	like	I	was	about	to	hold	up	a	liquor	store. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Getting	it	all	to	fit	was	a	challenge,	although	leaving	out	the	anorak	helped.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	always	lay	it	down	in	the	back	of	the	SUV.	When	my	gaze	traveled	back	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 closet,	 where	 all	 my	 “fun”	 clothes	 still	 hung,	 looking	 a	 bit	 forlorn	 and abandoned,	it	lingered	on	the	black	dress	I’d	worn	out	for	drinks	on	my	birthday. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	right,	I	knew	there	was	no	reason	I’d	ever	need	to	wear	that	dress	again,	but	I loved	 the	 way	 it	 fit,	 the	 way	 it	 seemed	 to	 follow	 all	 the	 curves	 of	 my	 body without	clinging	too	much.	But	it	was	made	of	knit	fabric	and	wouldn’t	take	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	much	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Off	the	hanger,	it	did	roll	up	into	a	surprisingly	small	ball.	I	tucked	the	dress</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	a	corner	of	the	suitcase	and	then	zipped	the	thing	closed.	A	sound	outside	on the	 landing	 made	 me	 start,	 but	 it	 was	 only	 Dutchie,	 coming	 up	 to	 investigate what	I	was	doing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	about	done,”	I	told	her,	lugging	the	suitcase	off	the	bed	and	picking	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 lighter	 of	 the	 two	 duffle	 bags,	 the	 one	 with	 my	 underthings	 in	 it.	 I’d	 come back	for	the	other	duffle	bag	and	my	coat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dog	ran	ahead	of	me	down	the	stairs,	tail	wagging.	It	seemed	she	knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	 these	 preparations	 meant	 —	 that	 I’d	 be	 going	 in	 the	 Cherokee	 soon,	 and that	meant	she’d	be	going	along	as	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 set	 the	 luggage	 down	 by	 the	 breakfast	 bar,	 then	 returned	 to	 my	 apartment and	gathered	up	the	rest	of	my	things.	Sitting	on	the	small	side	table	next	to	the couch	was	a	wedding	photo	of	my	parents,	my	mother	with	impossible	big	’80s</p>
<p class="calibre1">hair	but	looking	beautiful	even	so,	and	next	to	it	a	snapshot	taken	last	year	of	the whole	 family	 at	 a	 football	 game,	 Devin	 wearing	 his	 shoulder	 pads,	 sweaty	 and grinning	proudly.	My	heart	clenched	when	I	looked	at	their	faces,	and	yet	I	knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	couldn’t	leave	them	behind.	What	if	I	began	to	forget	what	they	looked	like? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fighting	back	tears,	I	shoved	the	pictures,	frames	and	all,	into	my	oversized</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>purple	 purse;	 I	 wasn’t	 sure	 why	 I	 was	 bringing	 it,	 since	 the	 backpack	 I	 was taking	with	the	rest	of	the	camping	equipment	was	a	lot	more	practical.	But	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">purse	 seemed	 to	 be	 the	 last	 reminder	 of	 the	 “old”	 me	 I	 had	 —	 the	 cell	 phone, useless	now,	although	a	few	days	earlier	I	would	have	said	I	couldn’t	have	lasted</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	 than	 a	 few	 hours	 without	 it;	 the	 tube	 of	 lip	 gloss;	 my	 wallet;	 stubs	 from movies	 I’d	 seen	 over	 the	 last	 few	 months;	 a	 pen	 and	 some	 tissue,	 because	 my mother	told	me	I	should	always	carry	a	pen	and	Kleenex. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 my	 keys.	 I	 went	 out	 onto	 the	 landing,	 closed	 the	 door	 behind	 me,	 and then	locked	it.	I	couldn’t	really	say	why,	as	I	doubted	any	survivors	—	if	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	more	besides	me	and	the	late	Chris	Bowman	—	would	bother	coming	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	way	back	here	to	loot	the	apartment.	Our	house	was	one	of	the	more	modest</p>
<p class="calibre1">ones	on	the	street;	there	were	plenty	of	better	pickings	elsewhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	that	thought	only	served	to	depress	me,	as	if	the	things	my	parents	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">worked	 so	 hard	 for	 had	 turned	 out	 to	 be	 worth	 very	 little	 in	 the	 end.	 The	 first stinging	 pinpricks	 of	 tears	 told	 me	 I’d	 better	 abandon	 that	 line	 of	 thought,	 as	 I still	had	a	lot	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	maybe,	just	maybe,	I’d	feel	better	once	I	was	gone	and	away	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">place	that	now	only	served	to	remind	me	of	everything	I’d	lost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	end,	the	Cherokee	was	full	but	not	filled.	I	put	two	bottles	of	water	in	the cup	holders,	patted	the	passenger	seat	so	Dutchie	would	know	it	was	time	to	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">in,	 and	 shut	 the	 door	 behind	 her.	 After	 that,	 I	 climbed	 in	 behind	 the	 wheel	 and closed	my	own	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 the	 exertion	 had	 made	 my	 wrists	 start	 to	 ache	 again,	 but	 only	 slightly, which	just	proved	some	sort	of	supernatural	healing	must	be	going	on.	Not	that	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	going	to	argue.	Heading	out	into	the	world	while	even	partly	incapacitated</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t	a	very	good	idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So…had	my	unseen	guardian	speeded	up	my	healing	process	so	my	injuries</p>
<p class="calibre1">wouldn’t	slow	down	my	departure? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	know	how	I	should	feel	about	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	point	in	brooding	over	it	now,	though.	I	was	just	glad	that	I	was	able	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	out	of	the	driveway	without	my	wrists	or	hands	hurting	too	much.	Today, </p>
<p class="calibre1">although	the	sky	was	mainly	blue,	I	could	see	clouds	beginning	to	drift	in	from</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>the	northeast.	I	hoped	they	didn’t	indicate	some	kind	of	weather	was	on	the	way; bad	enough	that	the	voice	expected	me	to	head	out	of	town	in	a	direction	of	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">choosing	without	having	to	handle	driving	in	heavy	rain	as	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 —	 or	 it	 —	 had	 been	 conspicuously	 silent	 so	 far	 this	 morning.	 It	 could simply	 be	 that	 he	 had	 no	 reason	 to	 intervene	 while	 I	 was	 packing,	 since	 I	 was already	doing	his	bidding	by	prepping	to	get	out	of	Albuquerque. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	local	Walgreens	was	around	a	half	mile	from	my	house.	Its	parking	lot</p>
<p class="calibre1">backed	up	to	a	middle	school,	and	it	felt	stranger	than	strange	to	get	out	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">SUV	 and	 not	 see	 a	 bunch	 of	 kids	 running	 around	 on	 the	 soccer	 field	 and	 the track.	At	least	it	was	far	enough	away	that	I	couldn’t	tell	if	those	fields	had	little piles	 of	 gray	 dust	 scattered	 around	 on	 them.	 No,	 I	 realized	 they	 probably wouldn’t,	 as	 the	 schools	 had	 been	 closed	 down	 fairly	 quickly…not	 that	 it	 had made	much	of	a	difference	in	the	end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	approached	the	drugstore,	I	saw	that	the	front	doors	had	been	smashed</p>
<p class="calibre1">in.	 Glass	 was	 strewn	 everywhere.	 My	 hackles	 went	 up,	 and	 I	 almost	 reached back	and	pulled	out	the	Glock,	which	I’d	tucked	into	my	waistband.	The	whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">incident	 with	 Chris	 Bowman	 had	 put	 me	 more	 than	 a	 little	 on	 edge,	 and	 I’d decided	to	drive	with	the	gun	on	me.	The	S&amp;W	was	way	too	big	for	that,	though, so	I’d	gone	with	the	Glock.	It	would	still	flatten	someone,	especially	if	I	hit	them with	multiple	rounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	as	I	entered	the	store,	glass	crunching	under	my	hiking	boots,	it	seemed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 place	 was	 deserted	 enough.	 Dark,	 too	 —	 I	 supposed	 I	 should	 have	 been expecting	 that,	 but	 in	 my	 mind’s	 eye	 the	 Walgreens	 was	 always	 brightly	 lit, blazing	 with	 fluorescent	 illumination.	 I	 paused	 by	 the	 checkout	 counter,	 which was	close	enough	to	the	door	that	I	could	see	what	I	was	doing,	and	plucked	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 keychain	 flashlights	 off	 the	 display	 there.	 Not	 as	 good	 as	 my	 father’s Maglite,	which	was	buried	deep	in	the	cargo	area	of	the	car,	but	it	would	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 turned	 on	 the	 flashlight,	 grabbed	 a	 cart,	 and	 made	 my	 way	 to	 the	 back	 of the	store	where	the	pharmacy	was	located.	All	around	me,	I	could	see	evidence</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	looting	—	empty	shelves,	racks	overturned,	aisles	filled	with	discarded	bags</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	Doritos,	rolls	of	toilet	paper,	kids’	toys.	My	heart	sank.	If	so	much	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken,	what	would	be	left	for	me	to	collect? </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	it	turned	out,	not	a	heck	of	a	lot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 were	 still	 some	 generic	 medications	 left	 in	 the	 first	 aid	 aisle	 —</p>
<p class="calibre1">ibuprofen,	 allergy	 remedies,	 sore	 throat	 lozenges.	 I	 grabbed	 boxes	 haphazardly and	 threw	 them	 into	 the	 cart	 I’d	 picked	 up	 at	 the	 front	 of	 the	 store,	 figuring something	was	better	than	nothing.	All	was	chaos	behind	the	pharmacy	counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 didn’t	 know	 if	 all	 those	 items	 had	 been	 taken	 by	 people	 who	 were	 sick	 and trying	 desperately	 to	 alleviate	 their	 symptoms,	 or	 whether	 any	 survivors	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a>realized	there	was	a	lot	of	heavy-duty	stuff	here	just	ripe	for	the	picking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pretty	 much	 anything	 with	 an	 opiate	 in	 it	 was	 gone,	 I	 realized	 as	 I	 ran	 the flashlight’s	 beam	 over	 the	 shelves.	 I	 could	 forget	 about	 easing	 the	 pain	 of armageddon	 with	 a	 little	 Oxycontin.	 All	 of	 the	 high-powered	 stuff	 was	 gone, except	for	one	bottle	of	codeine-laced	cough	syrup	high	on	a	shelf.	I	took	that, </p>
<p class="calibre1">figuring	it	might	come	in	handy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	antibiotics	were	also	ransacked,	although	I	found	a	couple	of	bottles	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">tetracycline.	Old	school,	but	it	would	still	work	just	fine	for	an	infected	wound</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	a	bout	of	bronchitis.	They	got	added	to	the	growing	pile	in	the	cart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	lot	of	the	medications	had	names	I	didn’t	even	recognize,	so	I	passed	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">those	 by.	 What	 I	 really	 wanted	 was	 the	 birth	 control	 pills,	 and	 I	 found	 those when	I	went	around	a	corner,	on	a	set	of	shelves	that	were	a	little	disorganized</p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 mainly	 intact.	 It	 made	 sense;	 most	 people	 probably	 weren’t	 thinking	 of family	 planning	 when	 they	 were	 being	 beaten	 down	 by	 the	 modern-day</p>
<p class="calibre1">equivalent	of	a	Biblical	plague. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	small	sigh	of	relief	escaped	my	lips	when	I	found	the	Ortho-Novum,	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">gathered	up	every	little	packet	they	had.	Enough	to	last	me	for	a	year,	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">looks	of	it.	After	that,	well…I’d	worry	about	that	then. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Like	you’re	really	going	to	be	alive	a	year	from	now. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pushed	that	thought	out	of	my	head.	Two	days	ago,	I	was	sure	I’d	be	dead</p>
<p class="calibre1">along	with	everyone	else,	and	yet	here	I	still	was.	Never	say	die. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 had	 been	 a	 favorite	 phrase	 of	 my	 mother’s.	 How	 woefully</p>
<p class="calibre1">inappropriate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mouth	 tightening,	 I	 moved	 the	 flashlight	 I	 carried	 over	 the	 shelves	 once more	to	make	sure	I	wasn’t	missing	anything.	The	problem	was,	I	didn’t	get	sick</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	 that	 often,	 and	 even	 when	 I	 did,	 regular	 over-the-counter	 stuff	 worked	 just fine	 for	 me.	 I	 could	 be	 leaving	 something	 valuable	 behind	 here	 and	 wouldn’t even	know	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">You	 can’t	 take	 everything, </i>	 I	 told	 myself.	 Anyway,	 it	 was	 creepy	 in	 here, blundering	 around	 in	 the	 dark	 with	 only	 a	 single	 small	 flashlight	 to	 relieve	 the gloom.	 Better	 for	 me	 to	 just	 cut	 my	 losses	 and	 get	 out.	 It	 wasn’t	 as	 if	 there wouldn’t	be	more	drugstores	between	here	and…wherever	I	was	going. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 thought	 reassured	 me	 somewhat,	 so	 I	 stepped	 out	 from	 behind	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">counter	 and	 made	 my	 way	 two	 aisles	 over,	 where	 the	 feminine	 products	 were located.	I	didn’t	pay	attention	to	brand	or	type,	but	just	tossed	boxes	of	tampons and	 packages	 of	 maxi	 pads	 into	 the	 cart	 until	 I	 was	 almost	 out	 of	 room.	 That should	do	me	for	a	while,	and	I	still	needed	to	see	if	anything	edible	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">left	behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	began	walking	toward	the	far	left	of	the	store,	where	I	knew	the	food	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>located.	Anything	in	the	refrigerated	case	would	be	spoiled	—	and	I	was	glad	the doors	 were	 all	 shut,	 as	 otherwise	 the	 smell	 probably	 would	 have	 been	 nasty	 as hell	 —	 but	 there	 could	 still	 be	 chips	 and	 crackers	 and	 cookies,	 probably	 some beef	jerky	and	other	things	of	that	ilk	as	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	 the	 healthiest	 of	 diets,	 but	 sometimes	 you	 had	 to	 take	 what	 you	 could get. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figuring	I	should	try	to	pick	up	some	food	for	Dutchie	as	well,	I	stopped	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	aisle	where	the	drugstore	usually	stocked	dog	treats	and	a	few	brands	of	dry</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 canned	 food	 —	 not	 the	 stuff	 I	 would	 have	 chosen	 to	 feed	 her	 under	 ideal circumstances,	 but	 it	 would	 have	 been	 better	 than	 nothing.	 However,	 for	 some strange	 reason,	 those	 shelves	 were	 completely	 picked	 over.	 I	 even	 skidded	 on some	 scattered	 pellets	 of	 dry	 food	 before	 I	 regained	 my	 balance	 and	 glanced down	 to	 see	 that	 a	 big	 bag	 of	 Purina	 had	 been	 torn	 open,	 its	 contents	 scattered across	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Muttering	a	curse,	I	left	that	aisle	and	went	to	the	snack	food	section,	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	in	slightly	better	shape,	and	started	gathering	up	what	I	could.	By	the	time</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	dropped	a	couple	of	packets	of	beef	jerky	and	a	box	of	Ritz	crackers	on	top</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	pile	in	my	basket,	it	was	full,	and	I	figured	I	needed	to	get	going.	It	was almost	noon,	according	to	the	watch	I’d	fished	out	of	my	nightstand	and	strapped</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	my	wrist.	A	while	back	I’d	almost	stopped	wearing	watches,	since	I	could	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">look	at	my	phone,	but	now	the	watch	was	the	only	thing	telling	me	what	time	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">actually	was.	Yes,	I	had	the	clock	in	the	Cherokee,	but	that	only	helped	when	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	driving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	 just	 passed	 the	 checkout	 counter	 —	 trying	 to	 quash	 my	 very	 real</p>
<p class="calibre1">sensation	 of	 guilt	 over	 walking	 out	 with	 a	 bunch	 of	 stuff	 I	 hadn’t	 paid	 for	 —</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	a	shadow	filled	the	doorway.	Almost	without	thinking,	I	reached	back	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 Glock	 tucked	 into	 my	 waistband.	 Yes,	 Chris	 Bowman	 was	 still	 dead	 and gone,	but	all	sorts	of	predators	could	still	be	out	there.	Or	at	least	as	many	as	the Heat	had	allowed	to	survive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	my	eyes	adjusted,	and	I	saw	the	shadow	was	that	of	a	man,	probably	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	late	forties,	smiling	at	me	nervously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sorry	I	startled	you,”	he	said,	seeming	to	take	note	of	how	I	remained</p>
<p class="calibre1">rooted	in	the	spot	where	I’d	stopped	by	the	checkout.	“It’s	just	—	I	haven’t	seen</p>
<p class="calibre1">anyone	else	alive	for	two	days.	I	thought	I	was	the	only	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	are	a	couple	of	us,	I	think,”	I	responded.	He	looked	pretty	harmless, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with	his	thinning	dark	hair	and	worried	eyes,	but	I	was	still	wary.	“I	never	heard anything	about	the	mortality	rate.	Everything	went	so…fast.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	nodded,	his	gaze	traveling	to	the	cart	in	front	of	me	and	then	back	up	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	face.	I	stiffened,	worried	I’d	see	the	same	sort	of	predatory	stare	that	Chris</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a>Bowman	had	given	me,	but	this	stranger	only	seemed	relieved	that	he	wasn’t	the only	living	person	left	in	Albuquerque.	“It	was	99.8	percent.	Or	at	least	that	was what	the	reports	said.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Reports?”	I	asked.	“What	reports?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	on	the	news,”	he	said.	“I	worked	in	the	emergency-management	bureau</p>
<p class="calibre1">downtown.	 Those	 were	 the	 latest	 figures	 we	 got	 before	 everything	 just…</p>
<p class="calibre1">stopped.	By	then	there	were	only	two	of	us	left	out	of	a	team	of	twenty-seven, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	Lydia	died	soon	afterward.	There	was	no	way	to	let	anyone	know…not	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	was	anyone	left	to	know,	I	suppose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	were	a	few	of	us.”	I	had	to	stop	then,	the	enormity	of	it	threatening	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">overwhelm	 me.	 With	 a	 mortality	 rate	 like	 that,	 it	 meant	 there	 were	 maybe	 two thousand	people	left	in	Albuquerque.	That	sounded	like	a	lot,	until	you	realized</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	 used	 to	 be	 almost	 a	 million	 people	 living	 in	 and	 around	 the	 city	 center. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you’re	right	—	I	suppose	it	wouldn’t	have	made	much	of	a	difference.	It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	as	if	we	could	have	stopped	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	he	agreed,	his	features	drooping	even	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So….”	 I	 went	 on,	 not	 sure	 where	 I	 was	 supposed	 to	 go	 from	 here.	 It	 was pretty	 clear	 that	 the	 voice	 meant	 for	 me	 to	 leave	 Albuquerque	 alone,	 but	 now that	 I’d	 met	 a	 survivor,	 could	 I	 simply	 leave	 him	 behind?	 He	 appeared	 to	 be harmless.	“Do	you	live	around	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 gave	 a	 vague	 gesture	 over	 his	 shoulder,	 toward	 the	 west.	 “Off</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chavez	Road.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 wasn’t	 too	 far	 from	 where	 we	 stood.	 No	 wonder	 he’d	 come	 foraging</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	here.	“Your	first	time	out	and	around…after?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	nod.	“I	didn’t	know	if	it	would	be	safe,	but	I	started	to	run	out	of	things, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	this	was	the	closest	store….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	plenty	left,”	I	assured	him.	“The	looters	kind	of	tore	the	place	up, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 they	 didn’t	 steal	 all	 the	 Doritos.	 I’d	 probably	 go	 to	 a	 grocery	 store	 if	 you really	want	something	decent	to	eat,	though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 was	 my	 plan	 after	 this,	 but	 I	 could	 walk	 here,	 so	 I	 figured	 I’d	 come here	first.”	For	the	first	time	his	eyes	took	on	a	certain	glint,	one	I	wasn’t	sure	I liked.	“That	your	Cherokee	out	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 wasn’t	 any	 point	 in	 denying	 it.	 For	 all	 I	 knew,	 he’d	 seen	 me	 pull	 up and	get	out	of	the	SUV.	“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Leaving	town?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	flicker	of	unease	went	over	me.	“I	was	thinking	about	it,”	I	hedged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	 my	 surprise,	 he	 didn’t	 seem	 that	 put	 off	 by	 my	 reply.	 “That	 might	 be	 a good	 idea.	 It	 might	 be	 safer	 where	 there	 aren’t	 as	 many	 survivors.	 People	 are going	to	get	desperate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a> <i class="calibre3">They	 already	 have, </i>	 I	 thought,	 recalling	 the	 way	 Chris	 Bowman	 had	 broken into	 my	 house.	 Then	 again,	 that	 was	 a	 special	 case	 of	 one	 highly	 obsessed	 nut job.	 The	 survivors	 in	 Albuquerque	 would	 probably	 be	 a	 lot	 more	 interested	 in getting	supplies	than	getting	into	my	pants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what	are	you	going	to	do?”	I	asked,	trying	to	shift	the	conversation	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	me	and	my	plans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 not	 sure.	 I	 figured	 food	 was	 the	 first	 step.	 After	 that?”	 He	 shrugged, then	offered	me	a	faint	smile.	“Right	now,	it’s	just	kind	of	good	to	hear	another</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 almost	 agreed	 with	 him,	 except	 I	 had	 been	 hearing	 a	 man’s	 voice	 in	 my head	 for	 the	 past	 few	 days.	 So	 what	 if	 the	 jury	 was	 still	 out	 as	 to	 whether	 that voice	was	real	or	not? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	don’t	want	to	leave	my	dog	sitting	in	the	car	too	long,”	I	said,	since</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	seemed	to	me	that	the	man	wouldn’t	mind	standing	here	and	chatting	all	day,	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	meant	he	didn’t	have	to	be	by	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	startled	by	the	 <i class="calibre3">non	sequitur, </i>	but	then	nodded.	“Oh,	of	course.	It	is starting	to	warm	up.	You	have	a	good	day.”	The	way	he	said	it	made	it	sound	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	he	wasn’t	sure	such	a	thing	was	possible	anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	 there	 wasn’t	 much	 else	 I	 could	 do,	 I	 smiled	 slightly,	 then	 moved toward	the	exit.	For	a	second	or	two,	I	was	worried	he	might	put	out	an	arm	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">stop	me,	but	he	only	stepped	out	of	the	way	and	headed	into	the	store. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 allowed	 myself	 a	 small	 sigh	 of	 relief	 before	 going	 to	 the	 Cherokee	 and unlocking	 it,	 then	 quickly	 unloading	 the	 loot	 from	 my	 cart	 into	 the	 rear	 cargo area.	From	the	front	seat,	Dutchie	whined,	but	I	wasn’t	sure	why.	It	was	a	little</p>
<p class="calibre1">warm	 in	 the	 car,	 but	 nothing	 too	 bad	 —	 I’d	 made	 sure	 to	 crack	 the	 windows before	I	locked	up	the	vehicle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 I	 turned	 around,	 though,	 I	 almost	 dropped	 the	 car	 key.	 The	 stranger was	 standing	 there,	 holding	 a	 pistol	 pointed	 straight	 at	 me.	 His	 expression	 was no	 longer	 mild,	 but	 greedy.	 Not	 the	 kind	 of	 greed	 I’d	 seen	 in	 Chris	 Bowman, though.	This	man’s	gaze	wasn’t	fixed	on	me,	but	the	SUV	I’d	just	closed	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	blinking,	he	said,	“Give	me	the	key.	Now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a><img src="index-86_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="index-86_2.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">EIGHT</p>
<p class="calibre1">At	first	I	could	only	stand	there,	gaping	at	him.	From	the	way	he	held	the	gun,	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">small	 .22,	 I	 could	 tell	 he	 didn’t	 have	 much	 experience.	 One	 part	 of	 my	 mind began	to	coolly	calculate	whether	I	was	fast	enough	to	get	that	Glock	out	of	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">waistband	 before	 he	 fired	 on	 me.	 My	 father	 had	 taken	 me	 to	 the	 indoor	 range many	times,	and	shooting	up	in	the	hills	around	town	even	more,	and	he’d	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	practice	pulling	the	gun	from	a	holster	as	well	as	the	waistband	of	my	pants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 knew	 I	 had	 far	 more	 experience	 than	 the	 man	 who	 faced	 me.	 But…was	 it enough? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stalling	for	time,	I	stammered,	“W-what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 heard	 me.”	 He	 waved	 the	 pistol	 in	 what	 he	 probably	 thought	 was	 a threatening	manner.	“I	don’t	want	to	hurt	you.	I	just	want	the	car.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	—	”	I	kept	my	hands	out	where	he	could	see	them,	knowing	that	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">probably	 nervous	 enough	 just	 handling	 the	 gun	 that	 he	 might	 do	 something really	stupid	if	I	made	any	sudden	movements.	“There	are	plenty	of	abandoned</p>
<p class="calibre1">vehicles	all	over	the	city.	You	don’t	need	mine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	do.”	His	gaze	shifted	from	the	rear	door	of	the	Cherokee	to	my	face, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	could	see	the	desperation	in	his	watery	brown	eyes.	“I	don’t	have	to	hunt</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	the	key,	and	it’s	a	four-wheel	drive	loaded	with	supplies.	I	doubt	I’m	going	to find	anything	better.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	when	he	put	it	that	way….	“It	needs	gas,	though.	Do	you	know	how	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>siphon	gas?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	bemused	expression	told	me	he	didn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,”	I	went	on,	knowing	there	was	no	way	in	hell	I	was	going	to	let	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	my	dad’s	SUV,	“it’s	been	a	horrible	week.	I	get	that	you	feel	desperate.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	don’t	need	to	do	this.	There	are	plenty	of	alterna	—	” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">BLAM! </i>	The	pistol	went	off	—	not	pointed	at	me,	thank	God,	but	somewhere</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	 my	 shoulder	 and	 just	 above	 the	 roof	 line	 of	 the	 Cherokee.	 Even	 so,	 I jumped	 enough	 that	 I	 could	 feel	 the	 backs	 of	 my	 thighs	 hit	 the	 SUV’s	 rear bumper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	negotiating,”	he	said.	The	look	on	his	face	shifted	from	confused	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">crafty.	 “But	 maybe	 you	 could	 come	 along.	 You	 say	 you	 know	 how	 to	 siphon gas?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	actually	hadn’t	said	that	I	did,	but	the	truth	was,	my	father	had	showed	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 Devin	 once,	 when	 Devin	 ran	 out	 of	 gas	 while	 driving	 Mom’s	 Escape.	 It wasn’t	 that	 difficult,	 really,	 as	 long	 as	 you	 selected	 a	 vehicle	 without	 a	 locking gas	cap.	In	the	back	of	the	Cherokee,	along	with	the	rest	of	my	supplies,	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">long	rubber	tube	I’d	brought	along	for	that	very	purpose.	With	the	power	out,	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 simply	 be	 easier	 to	 siphon	 gas	 from	 abandoned	 vehicles	 rather	 than attempt	to	switch	the	pumps	at	a	gas	station	over	to	manual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	I	do,”	I	hedged,	my	pulse	beginning	to	escalate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 seem	 like	 you	 might	 be…useful,”	 the	 man	 said,	 and	 this	 time	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">watery	gaze	remained	fixed	on	my	face.	It	was	clear	his	thoughts	were	beginning</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	run	in	other	directions	than	merely	stealing	my	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Dude,	 I	 could	 put	 you	 through	 a	 wall, </i>	 I	 thought,	 but	 that	 inner	 remark	 was more	 bravado	 than	 anything	 else.

<p class="calibre1">Since	 I	 couldn’t	 trust	 myself	 to	 speak	 without	 giving	 myself	 away,	 I	 only shrugged.	 At	 the	 same	 time,	 I	 let	 my	 hands	 drop	 to	 my	 sides,	 my	 right	 hand beginning	to	move	slowly	backward,	toward	the	reassuring	weight	of	the	Glock</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	my	waistband.	Thank	God	the	shirt	I	was	wearing	hung	loosely	enough	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 man	 didn’t	 seem	 to	 have	 noticed	 he	 wasn’t	 the	 only	 armed	 person	 in	 this little	convo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 stepped	 closer.	 Now	 I	 could	 smell	 the	 stink	 of	 perspiration	 and	 fear	 on him.	Maybe	I	hadn’t	had	a	decent	shower	since	before	the	Heat	began,	either,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	least	I’d	tried	to	wash	up	as	best	I	could,	and	made	sure	to	put	on	deodorant</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	 I	 got	 dressed	 each	 morning.	 I	 couldn’t	 say	 the	 same	 for	 this	 useless specimen	of	humanity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Were	only	the	weak,	the	crazy,	or	the	unscrupulous	left?	And	if	that	was	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>case,	what	the	hell	did	that	say	about	me? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 decided	 I’d	 think	 about	 that	 later.	 In	 the	 meantime,	 I	 had	 bigger	 things	 to worry	 about.	 I	 needed	 to	 get	 away	 from	 this	 guy.	 Shooting	 him	 was	 not	 a particularly	appealing	prospect,	but	I	would	if	I	had	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	wonder	the	voice	had	been	urging	me	to	get	out	of	Albuquerque.	I	wished</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 hadn’t	 dragged	 my	 feet	 quite	 so	 much	 about	 that.	 If	 I’d	 left	 straight	 away,	 as he’d	 told	 me	 to	 do,	 I	 would	 never	 have	 run	 into	 Chris	 Bowman…wouldn’t	 be standing	here	now,	with	this	milquetoast	former	bureaucrat	holding	his	puny	.22</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	me	and	thinking	he	was	Dirty	Harry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 where	 the	 hell	 was	 the	 voice?	 He	 had	 saved	 me	 from	 Chris	 the	 Creep twice,	but	was	conspicuously	absent	at	the	moment.	Did	he	think	I	could	handle</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	guy	on	my	own? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Time	to	find	out,	I	supposed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I’m	very	useful,”	I	snapped,	reaching	the	rest	of	the	way	so	I	could	pull</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Glock	out	of	the	waistband	of	my	Levi’s	and	point	it	straight	at	the	stranger’s face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 blinked	 and	 took	 a	 step	 backward.	 The	 gun	 wavered	 in	 his	 hands,	 and then	he	tightened	his	grip.	“You	didn’t	need	to	do	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 I	 kind	 of	 did,	 since	 you	 were	 holding	 a	 gun	 on	 me.”	 Unlike	 him,	 I didn’t	move,	didn’t	blink.	“By	the	way,	my	father	was	a	police	officer.	He	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">sure	I	knew	how	to	shoot	this	thing.	So	don’t	think	for	a	second	that	I’m	holding</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	 gun	 up	 for	 show,	 because	 I’m	 not.	 I	 know	 what	 I’m	 doing.	 The	 best	 thing you	can	do	is	back	off	and	go	find	a	car	someplace	else.	There	are	thousands	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	city	up	for	grabs	right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	 response	 at	 first.	 His	 mouth	 opened	 and	 closed	 once,	 making	 him	 look like	a	fish	on	a	hook.	I	got	the	distinct	impression	he	didn’t	know	what	he	should do	—	shoot,	or	turn	tail	and	flee.	That	made	him	all	the	more	dangerous,	in	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes,	because	I	really	didn’t	know	how	he	was	going	to	react.	I	doubted	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone	who’d	been	inclined	toward	criminal	acts	in	his	past	life.	But	he’d	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">pushed	 to	 the	 limit	 by	 all	 the	 death	 he’d	 seen,	 and	 that	 made	 him	 volatile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unpredictable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please,”	I	said	softly.	“Just	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 gun	 shook	 in	 his	 hands.	 I	 remained	 motionless,	 the	 Glock	 still	 pointed directly	 at	 his	 face,	 my	 stance	 square	 and	 solid,	 just	 the	 way	 my	 father	 had taught	me.	Then	I	saw	him	twitch,	and	thought, </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Oh,	shit. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	bang,	louder	than	I’d	anticipated.	Smoke	puffed	out	from	the	chamber	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	.22,	and	I	knew	the	bullet	was	going	to	hit	me.	How	could	he	miss	at	such</p>
<p class="calibre1">close	range? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>Time	slowed	down,	or	possibly	my	thought	processes	sped	up.	I	wasn’t	quite sure,	 but	 it	 was	 almost	 as	 if	 I	 could	 see	 the	 silvery-gray	 shape	 of	 the	 bullet speeding	toward	me.	My	entire	body	clenched,	waiting	for	the	shock	of	impact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	same	time,	my	finger	clenched	on	the	trigger	of	the	Glock,	and	it	went	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	a	much	more	impressive	 <i class="calibre3">bang</i>	than	the	one	that	had	issued	from	the	.22.	My ears	began	to	ring.	That	was	the	first	time	I’d	ever	shot	a	gun	without	wearing</p>
<p class="calibre1">earplugs,	and	damn,	it	was	louder	than	I’d	expected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	 things	 happened	 then	 —	 first,	 it	 seemed	 as	 if	 the	 air	 in	 front	 of	 me shimmered,	and	the	bullet	the	stranger	had	fired	at	me	bounced	away	as	if	it	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">hit	a	pane	of	bulletproof	glass.	He	had	no	such	protection,	however,	and	the	shot</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	fired	hit	him	in	the	chest,	sending	him	flying	backward,	blood	beginning	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">run	down	the	front	of	the	sweat-stained	dress	shirt	he	wore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	head	hit	the	pavement	with	a	sharp	 <i class="calibre3">crack, </i>	and	I	winced.	But	even	as	I	did so,	I	realized	I	was	all	right.	It	should	have	been	me	lying	there	on	the	ground</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	dark	blood	trickling	from	my	chest,	but	it	wasn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Are	you	ready	to	leave	now? </i>	the	voice	asked.	For	some	reason,	he	sounded</p>
<p class="calibre1">tired.	Well,	that	made	two	of	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	finally	lowered	the	gun.	“That	was	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I	told	you	I	would	protect	you. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Couldn’t	you	have	stopped	him	before	he	fired	at	me?”	It	seemed	the	voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	falling	down	a	bit	in	the	omnipotence	department. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I	 cannot	 see	 everything.	 Your	 fear	 called	 me	 to	 you,	 just	 as	 it	 called	 to	 me</i> <i class="calibre3">last	 night	 when	 that	 creature	 broke	 into	 your	 house.	 When	 I	 saw	 what	 was</i> <i class="calibre3">happening,	I	put	up	the	barrier	to	keep	the	bullet	from	touching	you. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	 like	 that.	 What	 kind	 of	 powers	 did	 the	 voice	 control,	 to	 be	 able	 to construct	an	invisible	shield	that	would	deflect	a	bullet? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obviously	something	far,	far	beyond	anything	I’d	ever	heard	of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	then,	I’d	already	sort	of	gathered	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pulling	in	a	breath,	I	flipped	the	Glock’s	safety	back	on,	then	stuck	the	gun</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	my	waistband	once	again.	After	that,	I	looked	over	to	where	the	stranger	lay</p>
<p class="calibre1">groaning	on	the	asphalt.	From	the	amount	of	blood	that	had	pooled	beneath	him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	guessed	he	didn’t	have	much	longer	to	live.	Should	I	be	feeling	guilty	for	that? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	know.	At	the	moment,	all	I	felt	was	a	sort	of	bone-deep	weariness…and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	day	wasn’t	even	half	over	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 approached	 him,	 then	 crouched	 down	 near	 his	 head.	 His	 eyes	 flickered</p>
<p class="calibre1">open	 and	 fixed	 on	 me,	 pleading	 and	 scared.	 “I	 didn’t	 want	 to	 do	 that,”	 I	 said quietly.	 “You	 should	 have	 just	 left	 me	 alone.	 There’s	 plenty	 in	 this	 city	 for everyone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 strangled	 sound	 came	 from	 his	 throat,	 possibly	 one	 of	 protest.	 I	 couldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>tell	for	sure,	since	he	was	obviously	beyond	forming	actual	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although	I	knew	I’d	acted	in	self-defense,	hadn’t	even	squeezed	the	trigger</p>
<p class="calibre1">until	he’d	shot	at	me,	it	was	still	hard	to	see	him	like	this,	knowing	I	couldn’t	do anything	for	his	pain.	“I’m	sorry,”	I	said	at	last,	then	straightened	up	and	headed back	to	the	Cherokee.	The	best	thing	I	could	do	now	was	get	the	hell	out	of	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	got	in	the	car,	shut	the	door,	and	pulled	out	of	the	parking	space.	As	I	drove</p>
<p class="calibre1">away,	I	didn’t	look	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Head	north, </i> the	voice	said	once	I	was	a	few	blocks	from	the	Walgreens.  <i class="calibre3">Get	on</i> <i class="calibre3">the	freeway. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	kidding?”	I	asked,	hands	tight	on	the	steering	wheel.	Right	then,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t	 sure	 whether	 I	 had	 a	 death	 grip	 on	 the	 thing	 because	 of	 all	 the	 vehicles choking	the	roads,	or	because	I	was	still	shaking	from	that	confrontation	back	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 parking	 lot.	 Maybe	 a	 little	 bit	 of	 both.	 “The	 freeway	 is	 going	 to	 be	 worse than	the	surface	streets.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">No,	it	isn’t.	Trust	me. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Considering	 he’d	 just	 saved	 me	 from	 a	 speeding	 bullet,	 I	 decided	 to	 trust him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 closest	 on-ramp	 was	 at	 Paseo	 del	 Norte,	 so	 I	 headed	 in	 that	 direction, keeping	my	speed	below	twenty-five	miles	an	hour,	and	sometimes	even	slower</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	that,	depending	on	how	congested	the	street	around	me	was.	When	I	got	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	on-ramp,	I	actually	had	to	drive	onto	the	shoulder	to	get	around	two	vehicles</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	seemed	to	have	crashed	head-on	into	one	another.	Now	it	was	impossible	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell	whether	they’d	both	 been	 trying	 to	 get	 on	 the	 freeway	 at	 the	 same	 time,	 or whether	the	drivers	had	been	so	ill	that	they’d	basically	plowed	into	each	other	at the	worst	possible	spot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	that,	though,	the	connector	was	clear	enough,	and	I	eased	up	onto	I-25, </p>
<p class="calibre1">keeping	 my	 speed	 down.	 The	 voice	 had	 been	 right,	 though	 —	 yes,	 there	 were still	 abandoned	 vehicles	 here,	 but	 they	 tended	 to	 have	 either	 crashed	 into	 the center	divider	or	drifted	over	to	the	shoulder.	The	middle	two	lanes	were	fairly</p>
<p class="calibre1">clear,	although	I	still	had	to	slow	down	from	time	to	time	to	get	around	a	car	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">truck	that	had	stopped	in	the	center	of	the	highway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	fact,	the	going	was	easy	enough	that	I	thought	it	safe	to	risk	opening	one</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>of	the	water	bottles	so	I	could	get	a	drink.	My	throat	was	parched,	and	I	drank half	 the	 contents	 of	 the	 bottle	 without	 even	 stopping.	 In	 the	 passenger	 seat, Dutchie	cocked	her	head	and	looked	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	take	care	of	you	when	we	stop,	girl,”	I	told	her.	Along	with	the	camping</p>
<p class="calibre1">gear,	 I’d	 stowed	 a	 set	 of	 collapsible	 dog	 dishes	 in	 the	 back	 of	 the	 Cherokee, relics	of	the	times	when	we	used	to	take	Sadie	on	day	trips	with	us.	My	father</p>
<p class="calibre1">never	got	rid	of	anything	—	which	was	why	none	of	our	cars	ever	actually	lived</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 garage	 —	 and	 I’d	 found	 the	 dishes	 when	 I	 was	 scrounging	 some	 of	 the other	stuff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dutchie	wagged	her	tail,	then	sort	of	collapsed	onto	the	seat,	curling	up	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">smaller	ball	than	I	would	have	thought	possible.	Up	until	then,	she’d	been	sitting up	and	looking	out	the	window,	but,	truth	be	told,	once	you	were	on	the	freeway, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	sights	and	smells	really	weren’t	that	interesting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	where	are	we	going?”	I	asked	of	the	general	air	around	me.	Judging	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	delayed	reaction	to	the	man	who’d	assaulted	me	back	at	Walgreens,	the	voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t	 necessarily	 around	 at	 all	 times.	 In	 this	 case,	 since	 I	 was	 asking	 a	 direct question,	I	had	to	hope	he	was	close	enough	that	he	would	hear	me	and	respond. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">North</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Besides	 that,”	 I	 snapped,	 irritated	 now.	 I’d	 done	 what	 he	 asked	 —</p>
<p class="calibre1">Albuquerque	 was	 dropping	 farther	 and	 farther	 behind	 me,	 since	 I’d	 started	 out from	 the	 more	 northern	 end	 of	 the	 city	 sprawl	 anyway.	 At	 this	 point,	 I	 really couldn’t	 see	 the	 reason	 behind	 the	 continuing	 games	 of	 evasion.	 “It’s	 a	 little early	for	ski	season.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">That	is	all	you	need	to	know	for	now.	I	will	tell	you	when	it	is	time	to	get	off</i> <i class="calibre3">the	freeway. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 might	 have	 growled.	 But	 since	 I	 knew	 there	 was	 no	 point	 in	 pressing	 the issue,	 I	 took	 another	 swig	 of	 water	 and	 kept	 my	 gaze	 focused	 on	 the	 road.	 I actually	 hadn’t	 been	 about	 to	 run	 out	 of	 gas;	 the	 tank	 was	 nearly	 full.	 I’d	 just hoped	 that	 lying	 about	 the	 gas	 situation	 would	 convince	 the	 stranger	 at Walgreens	to	choose	some	other	prey.	So	much	for	that	brilliant	idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	any	rate,	I	knew	I	wouldn’t	have	to	stop	for	gas	for	some	time.	Maybe	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	all,	depending	on	how	far	I	was	going.	What	I	had	in	the	Cherokee	right	now</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 probably	 enough	 to	 get	 me	 to	 the	 Colorado	 border,	 although	 I	 sincerely hoped	I	wasn’t	going	quite	that	far. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 I	 continued	 to	 drive	 north	 on	 the	 freeway,	 pushing	 my	 speed	 closer	 to forty	 miles	 an	 hour	 as	 I	 left	 Albuquerque	 behind,	 and	 the	 vehicles	 littering	 the road	gradually	grew	fewer	and	farther	between.	Not	to	say	that	the	highway	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">completely	 empty,	 but	 it	 was	 open	 enough	 that	 I	 felt	 safe	 going	 a	 little	 faster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wherever	 I	 was	 headed,	 I	 wanted	 to	 get	 there	 as	 quickly,	 albeit	 as	 safely,	 as	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	 hour	 passed.	 Dutchie	 slept	 in	 the	 passenger	 seat,	 and	 I	 could	 feel	 my stomach	begin	to	growl.	If	I’d	been	thinking	clearly,	I	would’ve	gotten	some	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	food	out	of	the	back	and	brought	it	up	here	with	me,	but	shooting	someone	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">point-blank	range	does	tend	to	rattle	your	logic	centers	a	bit.	Ever	since	I’d	left Albuquerque,	 I’d	 been	 telling	 myself	 that	 there	 was	 nothing	 else	 I	 could	 have done,	that	he’d	shot	at	me	first…but	those	kinds	of	reassurances	only	go	so	far</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	 you’re	 trying	 to	 wrestle	 with	 the	 realization	 that	 you’d	 killed	 someone earlier	that	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">It	was	not	your	fault. </i> The	voice	was	soothing,	its	earlier	weariness	apparently gone.	 I	 must	 have	 been	 really	 broadcasting	 my	 angst,	 because	 in	 general,	 the voice	 only	 answered	 direct	 questions	 and	 didn’t	 respond	 to	 my	 inner	 thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">He	forced	the	issue.	You	should	not	blame	yourself. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	that	intellectually.	But	I	also	knew	that	killing,	even	in	self-defense, </p>
<p class="calibre1">carried	its	own	weight	of	emotional	consequences.	When	I	was	in	high	school, </p>
<p class="calibre1">my	father	had	shot	someone	while	on	duty	—	a	drug	dealer	who’d	drawn	a	.38</p>
<p class="calibre1">Special	when	he	was	pulled	over	for	running	a	red	light.	My	father	didn’t	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	choice	but	to	shoot.	Even	so,	he	was	in	counseling	for	months	after	that, </p>
<p class="calibre1">coming	to	terms	with	what	he’d	done.	Taking	a	human	life	was	not	something	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	dismissed	lightly.	And	how	much	heavier	was	the	burden	of	doing	something</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	that	when	so	few	people	were	even	left	alive? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wasn’t	sure,	but	at	the	moment	it	felt	pretty	damn	heavy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The	world	has	changed, </i>	the	voice	told	me.  <i class="calibre3">So	you	must	change	with	it. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	I’m	supposed	to	not	care?”	That	didn’t	sound	right	at	all.	What	was	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">point	 of	 surviving	 all	 this,	 if	 the	 only	 way	 to	 do	 it	 was	 to	 become	 a	 person	 I didn’t	like	very	much? </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I	 did	 not	 say	 that.	 But	 there	 are	 certain	 realities	 you	 must	 face.	 There	 is</i> <i class="calibre3">nothing	wrong	with	killing,	if	that	is	the	only	way	for	you	to	stay	alive. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 other	 words,	 I	 shouldn’t	 feel	 bad	 about	 acting	 in	 self-defense.	 Maybe someday	I’d	get	to	that	point,	but	at	the	moment	I’d	had	too	many	shocks	in	too</p>
<p class="calibre1">short	 a	 period	 of	 time.	 I	 really	 just	 wanted	 to	 curl	 up	 in	 a	 ball	 somewhere	 and pretend	the	world	didn’t	exist	for	a	while. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Here, </i>	the	voice	told	me.  <i class="calibre3">Take	the	turnoff	for	84	north. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Santa	 Fe?”	 I	 asked	 in	 some	 surprise.	 For	 some	 reason,	 I’d	 thought	 I’d	 be going	much	farther	than	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Yes,	Santa	Fe. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	 thank	 God	 for	 small	 favors.	 I	 did	 as	 instructed	 and	 pulled	 onto	 the highway,	which	was	more	that	in	name	than	anything	else,	since	in	reality	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	a	four-lane	road	cutting	through	town,	with	shops	and	schools	on	either	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a>Here	I	had	to	slow	down	again,	as	there	was	a	good	deal	of	stalled	traffic	once more.	Not	enough	that	I	couldn’t	get	around	it	when	necessary,	even	if	I	had	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">pull	up	onto	the	island	at	the	center	of	the	street,	but	it	was	still	nerve-wracking. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Then	turn	here,	on	Cerrillos. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 we	 were	 heading	 into	 the	 heart	 of	 the	 town?	 I	 knew	 Santa	 Fe,	 although not	 intimately;	 my	 family	 had	 come	 here	 from	 time	 to	 time,	 mainly	 when	 my mother	was	tired	of	camping	and	hiking,	and	wanted	us	to	get	some	culture.	And</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	visited	the	town	with	Elena	and	Tori	a	couple	of	times,	generally	when	Elena</p>
<p class="calibre1">borrowed	her	parents’	timeshare	so	we	could	get	out	of	Albuquerque	and	let	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">hair	down	for	a	few	days.	Even	then,	though,	I	hadn’t	been	the	one	driving.	We</p>
<p class="calibre1">always	 took	 Elena’s	 car,	 because	 she	 had	 a	 Porsche	 Cayenne,	 which	 was	 a	 lot more	impressive	than	my	eight-year-old	Honda	or	Tori’s	Ford	pickup. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 I	 did	 know	 enough	 to	 realize	 if	 I	 stayed	 on	 my	 current	 route,	 I’d	 be heading	 toward	 the	 old	 town	 square	 and	 the	 touristy	 areas	 around	 it.	 Sort	 of	 a strange	 choice,	 if	 the	 voice	 was	 really	 that	 intent	 on	 keeping	 me	 out	 of population	centers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 slowed	 even	 more,	 as	 the	 road	 was	 getting	 narrower,	 and	 I	 knew	 I	 was about	to	enter	the	maze	of	one-way	streets	that	twisted	around	Santa	Fe’s	central</p>
<p class="calibre1">square.	 Oddly,	 there	 weren’t	 as	 many	 abandoned	 vehicles	 here.	 But	 this	 was	 a touristy	 area	 —	 maybe	 everyone	 had	 bugged	 out	 for	 home	 as	 soon	 as	 the infection	began	to	spread. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">And	now	down	Alameda. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	I’m	not	going	to	the	center	of	town?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">No. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it	far?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Not	that	far. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Good,	because	I	knew	I	was	going	to	need	a	bathroom	fairly	soon.	I	just	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	hope	that	my	destination	included	those	sorts	of	civilized	comforts,	even	if	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wouldn’t	be	able	to	flush	after	the	first	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 angled	 the	 Cherokee	 down	 Alameda,	 stopping	 every	 so	 often	 to	 go	 up	 on the	curb	to	avoid	yet	another	abandoned	car.	Luckily,	the	south	side	of	the	road</p>
<p class="calibre1">ran	 along	 an	 open	 greenbelt,	 so	 there	 were	 no	 businesses	 located	 there,	 which meant	no	parked	cars,	either.	To	either	side,	the	trees	were	brave	with	fluttering leaves	 of	 yellow	 and	 orange,	 but	 no	 one	 was	 around	 to	 admire	 their	 autumn finery,	 and	 I	 was	 too	 focused	 on	 my	 route	 to	 give	 them	 more	 than	 a	 passing glance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 street	 continued	 in	 this	 way	 for	 some	 time,	 until	 I	 was	 out	 of	 the downtown	area	and	in	a	more	residential	district,	still	heading	steadily	eastward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	the	voice	had	given	me	no	further	commands,	I	kept	going. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a> <i class="calibre3">And	 right	 here, </i>	 it	 said,	 just	 when	 I	 thought	 I	 was	 going	 to	 be	 on	 Alameda forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	as	instructed,	moving	onto	Canyon	Road.	As	I	did	so,	I	couldn’t	help</p>
<p class="calibre1">wondering	just	where	the	heck	I	was	going.	This	was	still	a	residential	area,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	houses	spaced	farther	apart.	The	upside	was	that	I	didn’t	have	nearly	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">many	stray	cars	to	maneuver	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Follow	the	curve, </i>	the	voice	said	then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Veering	 off	 to	 the	 left,	 I	 found	 myself	 now	 on	 Upper	 Canyon	 Road.	 It</p>
<p class="calibre1">narrowed	 further,	 but	 even	 in	 my	 current	 focused	 state,	 I	 couldn’t	 help	 being impressed	by	some	of	the	compounds	I	passed.	They	had	high	adobe	walls	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	to	stretch	on	for	a	full	block.	Just	the	kind	of	thing	for	people	with	fat</p>
<p class="calibre1">wallets	and	a	serious	need	for	privacy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 road	 wound	 on	 and	 on,	 steadily	 rising.	 It	 became	 more	 rutted,	 littered with	gravel.	I	slowed	down,	although	I	didn’t	think	it	was	quite	time	to	engage</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	four-wheel	drive.	There	was	still	pavement	under	my	tires,	albeit	pavement</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	hadn’t	been	very	well	maintained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually,	though,	even	that	rutted	and	gravelly	pavement	disappeared,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	road	turned	to	dirt.	I	brought	the	Cherokee	to	a	crawl,	put	it	in	neutral,	and then	 engaged	 the	 four-wheel	 drive.	 After	 I	 felt	 it	 catch,	 I	 sped	 up	 again,	 but cautiously,	knowing	I	should	keep	it	around	twenty-five	for	safety’s	sake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	up	here	there	were	scattered	home	sites,	and	I	wondered	if	I	would	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">told	 to	 turn	 off	 at	 one	 of	 them.	 But	 then	 the	 voice	 said,  <i class="calibre3">This	road</i>,	 indicating	 a dirt	 track	 that	 branched	 off	 from	 Upper	 Canyon,	 heading	 even	 farther	 into	 the hills. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 slowed	 down	 a	 little	 bit	 more,	 jolting	 and	 bouncing	 along	 the	 unpaved surface,	which	now	was	only	wide	enough	to	allow	a	single	car	through.	Good</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing	I	probably	didn’t	have	to	worry	about	someone	coming	this	way	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dutchie,	who’d	been	dozing	for	the	past	hour	or	more,	blinked	and	got	to	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">feet,	 pressing	 her	 nose	 to	 the	 window.	 She	 left	 quite	 a	 smudge,	 and	 I	 winced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	though	I	knew	my	father	was	far	past	caring	about	what	happened	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cherokee,	 I	 still	 couldn’t	 help	 experiencing	 some	 discomfort	 at	 knowing	 the SUV	 wouldn’t	 exactly	 be	 in	 showroom	 condition	 by	 the	 time	 I	 got	 to	 my destination…whatever	the	hell	that	might	be,	out	here	in	the	middle	of	nowhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	track	kept	snaking	farther	and	farther	back	into	the	hills.	At	least	I’d	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 experience	 driving	 off-road,	 so	 the	 rocky,	 rutted	 surface	 beneath	 the	 car didn’t	 bother	 me	 too	 much.	 What	 did	 bother	 me	 was	 how	 far	 away	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1">civilization	this	place	must	be.	Had	the	voice	lured	me	out	here	to…. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">To	 what? </i>	 I	 asked	 myself	 with	 some	 scorn.  <i class="calibre3">If	 he	 wanted	 to	 kill	 you	 or	 do</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a> <i class="calibre3">anything	else,	he	could	have	done	it	already.	What	would	be	the	point	in	sending</i> <i class="calibre3">you	out	to	the	back	of	beyond	like	this? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">No	point	at	all	that	I	could	tell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Which	didn’t	mean	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	least	the	voice	couldn’t	seem	to	hear	my	interior	monologue.	A	minute	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	later,	it	said,  <i class="calibre3">Here</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	 dirt	 track,	 even	 narrower	 than	 this	 one.	 It	 split	 off	 from	 the	 main road	—	if	you	could	call	it	that	—	and	wound	up	the	side	of	a	hill.	Around	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">crest	 of	 that	 hill,	 I	 thought	 I	 spied	 a	 flash	 of	 shimmering	 gold	 leaves.	 Aspen trees? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	where	the	voice	had	directed,	crawling	along.	Nothing	about	this	hill</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	 all	 that	 different	 from	 all	 the	 others	 I	 had	 passed.	 It	 was	 studded	 with juniper	 trees	 and	 yucca,	 with	 dry	 yellow	 grass	 in	 between.	 Yes,	 there	 was something	of	a	road,	but	leading	to	what? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	minutes	later,	I	had	my	answer.	Almost	hidden	until	you	came	upon	it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 compound	 of	 some	 sort	 was	 built	 just	 below	 the	 top	 of	 the	 hill.	 From	 what	 I could	 see,	 there	 was	 a	 main	 building	 and	 several	 smaller	 structures	 clumped around	it.	A	high	adobe	wall	appeared	to	circle	the	entire	property.	There	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">metal	 gate	 with,	 of	 all	 things,	 the	 same	 Zia	 sun	 symbols	 as	 seen	 on	 the	 New Mexico	 flag	 adorning	 its	 four	 quadrants.	 At	 the	 moment,	 that	 gate	 stood	 wide open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	brought	the	Cherokee	to	a	stop.	The	voice	said,  <i class="calibre3">It	is	all	right.	There	is	no</i> <i class="calibre3">one	here. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	is	the	gate	open?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I	opened	it	for	you. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	sure	what	I	should	do	about	that	particular	statement,	I	swallowed,	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">nudged	the	gas.	The	SUV	moved	forward	slowly,	and	in	a	few	more	seconds,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 inside	 the	 compound.	 Almost	 as	 soon	 as	 the	 rear	 bumper	 had	 cleared	 the gate,	it	closed	behind	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	again?”	I	asked,	hoping	I’d	kept	most	of	the	worry	out	of	my	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Yes</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	there	was	nothing	else	to	do,	I	took	a	quick	survey	of	my	surroundings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	seemed	to	be	a	large	house,	built	in	the	typical	Santa	Fe	style	with	sheer</p>
<p class="calibre1">walls	 of	 thick	 adobe	 and	 a	 flat	 roof.	 Aspen	 trees	 surrounded	 it,	 their	 golden leaves	fluttering	in	the	afternoon	breeze.	Just	past	the	house	was	an	outbuilding</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	appeared	to	be	a	large	garage	with	four	bays,	and	beyond	that	something	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	like	an	extensive	greenhouse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	was	very	tidy,	very	neat,	except	for	some	fallen	aspen	leaves	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 ground.	 Here,	 the	 driveway	 was	 crushed	 gravel,	 which	 crunched	 under	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>wheels	 of	 the	 Cherokee	 as	 I	 slowly	 inched	 it	 toward	 the	 garage.	 When	 I approached,	the	door	to	the	bay	farthest	on	the	left	rolled	up	and	out	of	the	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	time	it	wasn’t	entirely	unexpected,	but	I	still	felt	the	skin	along	the	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	my	neck	prickle	as	I	pulled	into	the	garage.	The	bay	was	quite	wide,	almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">big	enough	for	two	cars,	so	I	had	plenty	of	room	to	park	and	then	climb	out.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	scrupulously	clean,	the	walls	finished.	Overhead,	a	light	bulb	glowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	blinked	at	it,	wondering	if	I	was	imagining	things.	Or	maybe	that	was	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	of	the	voice	flexing	its	power.	“Is	that	you?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">No.	Look	out,	past	the	house. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	did	as	instructed,	ignoring	Dutchie’s	whines	to	be	let	out.	She	could	hang</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 a	 minute	 longer.	 As	 I	 paused	 at	 the	 entrance	 to	 the	 garage,	 I	 saw	 that	 the property	was	very	large,	probably	at	least	four	or	five	acres,	all	enclosed	within that	high	adobe	wall.	The	other	structure	I’d	glimpsed	was	in	fact	a	greenhouse, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	beyond	that	was	a	small	solar	farm,	and	beyond	that	still	I	spied	a	windmill</p>
<p class="calibre1">whirling	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	power	here?”	I	had	to	fight	the	words	past	the	lump	in	my	throat; </p>
<p class="calibre1">crazy	how	the	mere	thought	of	having	electricity	could	get	me	so	worked	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">That,	and	so	much	more.	Come	—	let	me	show	you. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded,	but	then	hurried	over	to	open	the	passenger	door.	Dutchie	sprang</p>
<p class="calibre1">out,	 tail	 wagging,	 and	 promptly	 christened	 the	 place	 by	 squatting	 down	 on	 a patch	 of	 grass	 next	 to	 the	 garage.	 Despite	 everything,	 I	 couldn’t	 help	 grinning and	shaking	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	then	I	turned	away	from	her	so	I	could	follow	the	flagstone	path	that	led</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	garage	to	the	front	door	of	the	house.	It	was	painted	blue,	and	shaded</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 a	 long	 colonnaded	 façade,	 with	 heavy	 wood	 beams	 supporting	 the	 roof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again,	typical	New	Mexico	architecture,	but	it	looked	heavy	and	solid.	Safe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	put	my	hand	on	the	latch.	The	door	was	unlocked,	and	swung	inward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 all	 I	 could	 do	 not	 to	 let	 out	 a	 gasp.	 The	 house	 was,	 as	 Elena	 might have	put	it,	amazeballs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	 tiled	 floors.	 Wooden	 viga	 ceilings	 overhead.	 A	 kiva	 fireplace	 in	 one corner.	Big,	heavy	ranch-style	furniture.	Navajo	rugs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stepped	inside,	Dutchie	on	my	heels,	then	carefully	closed	the	door	behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">me.	My	footsteps	echoed	off	the	shining	floor	as	I	moved	farther	into	the	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 the	 sort	 of	 place	 I	 might	 have	 seen	 in	 a	 magazine,	 with	 doorways	 of sculpted	 adobe,	 Mexican	 star	 lights	 made	 of	 pierced	 tin	 hanging	 in	 the	 entry, every	piece	seemingly	selected	for	one	particular	spot	and	that	spot	only,	unique</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	beautiful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	this	place?”	I	breathed,	after	I’d	recovered	myself	enough	to	move</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 the	 living	 room	 into	 the	 dining	 room,	 which	 was	 dominated	 by	 a	 copper-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>topped	table	big	enough	for	twelve	and	sturdy	chairs	of	dark	wood	with	leather seats	and	nail-head	accents.	Landscapes	of	the	area	around	Santa	Fe	hung	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">walls. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">It	 was	 built	 by	 a	 real	 estate	 developer	 from	 Phoenix	 who	 wanted	 to	 make</i> <i class="calibre3">sure	he	would	survive	the	end	of	the	world	in	comfort.	Unfortunately,	his	plans</i> <i class="calibre3">did	not	take	disease	into	account,	only	war	and	civil	unrest. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">What	was	I	supposed	to	say	to	that? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shaking	my	head,	I	went	into	the	kitchen,	which	was	roughly	twice	the	size</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 my	 little	 over-the-garage	 apartment.	 I	 heard	 a	 faint	 humming	 noise	 and wondered	 what	 it	 might	 be,	 then	 realized	 it	 was	 the	 refrigerator.	 Strange	 how only	 a	 few	 days	 without	 those	 sorts	 of	 background	 noises	 could	 render	 them unfamiliar,	alien. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	to	know.	I	walked	over	to	the	refrigerator	and	opened	the	door.	Inside, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 was	 stocked	 with	 items	 that	 wouldn’t	 spoil	 easily	 —	 cheese,	 sausage,	 lunch meats.	 A	 six-pack	 of	 Kilt	 Lifter	 ale	 sat	 on	 the	 bottom	 shelf.	 When	 I	 peeked inside	the	freezer	section,	it	seemed	as	if	it	was	full	of	other	similar	“guy	food” </p>
<p class="calibre1">sorts	of	items:	frozen	pizza,	tamales,	taquitos.	A	box	of	Hot	Pockets.	A	couple	of bags	of	frozen	chicken	breasts	from	Trader	Joe’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dutchie	 cocked	 her	 head,	 tongue	 lolling	 out.	 I	 wondered	 if	 she’d	 gotten	 a whiff	of	the	cheese	or	sausages	in	the	deli	section	of	the	fridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 looks	 like	 the	 owner	 just	 stepped	 out,”	 I	 said,	 my	 tone	 only	 partly accusing.	“Are	you	sure	no	one’s	been	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Quite	sure.	The	developer	died	two	days	ago,	and	the	man	he	hired	to	watch</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">over	 this	 place	 passed	 away	 yesterday,	 only	 three	 days	 after	 the	 last	 time	 he</i> <i class="calibre3">checked	 in	 here.	 You’ll	 find	 more	 food	 in	 the	 pantry,	 and	 a	 storeroom	 in	 the</i> <i class="calibre3">basement	 with	 canned	 goods,	 flour,	 sugar…that	 sort	 of	 thing.	 The	 greenhouse</i> <i class="calibre3">has	tomatoes,	lettuce,	carrots,	strawberries,	and	more. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Basically,	 pretty	 much	 anything	 I	 would	 need	 to	 keep	 on	 living	 for	 a	 good deal	longer.	And	while	doing	it	basically	in	the	lap	of	luxury. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	did	you	find	this	place?”	I	asked.	I	sort	of	doubted	it	was	the	kind	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">property	that	popped	up	on	Trulia. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I	knew	you	would	need	a	sanctuary.	So	I…looked	around. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	sanctuary.	Yes,	that	was	what	this	place	felt	like.	More	questions	bubbled</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	my	mind,	but	I	wasn’t	sure	the	voice	would	answer	any	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	in	the	end,	what	did	it	matter?	I	was	here,	and	I	was	safe.	No	one	left</p>
<p class="calibre1">alive	 even	 knew	 this	 place	 existed,	 and	 I	 could	 hide	 here	 for…months.	 Years, probably.	Never	mind	that	I	didn’t	really	want	to	contemplate	what	it	would	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	to	be	out	here	for	years	and	years	with	only	a	disembodied	voice	and	a	dog</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	company. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>Well,	I	didn’t	have	to	think	about	that	now.	I	had	other	things	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,	Dutchie,”	I	said.	“Time	to	unpack	the	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	home.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">NINE</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	kitchen	cupboards,	I	found	brightly	colored	Fiesta	ware,	and	heavy	blown-</p>
<p class="calibre1">glass	tumblers	and	goblets	that	I	thought	must	have	come	from	Mexico.	I	poured</p>
<p class="calibre1">water	—	yes,	the	taps	worked,	thanks	to	a	well	out	back	that	was	powered	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">windmill	—	into	a	bowl	for	Dutchie,	and	then	tipped	some	of	the	Blue	Buffalo</p>
<p class="calibre1">dry	 food	 I’d	 brought	 from	 home	 into	 another	 bowl.	 She	 set	 to,	 lapping	 at	 the water	greedily,	crunching	away	at	the	dog	food.	I	could	tell	she	thought	she	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">home,	too.	At	some	point	I’d	have	to	see	about	replenishing	her	food	supply,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	could	wait	a	while.	Based	on	the	amount	of	kibble	left	in	the	bag,	she’d	need some	 more	 in	 about	 a	 week.	 In	 a	 pinch,	 I	 could	 defrost	 some	 of	 those	 frozen chicken	 breasts	 and	 cook	 them	 up	 for	 her,	 but	 it	 would	 probably	 be	 smarter	 to head	into	Santa	Fe	and	go	foraging	there	for	some	real	dog	food. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	the	moment,	though,	I	was	content	to	explore	the	rest	of	the	house.	It	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	large,	probably	at	least	four	thousand	square	feet,	although	I’d	be	the	first	to admit	 that	 I	 wasn’t	 very	 good	 at	 judging	 those	 sorts	 of	 things.	 But	 there	 were three	 bedrooms,	 as	 well	 as	 an	 office,	 a	 sitting	 room,	 and	 a	 family	 room,	 in addition	to	the	living	room	and	kitchen.	Off	the	back	of	the	house	was	another</p>
<p class="calibre1">covered	 patio,	 and	 surprisingly	 lush	 plantings	 of	 various	 native	 trees.	 In	 a secluded	 corner,	 a	 solar-powered	 fountain	 bubbled	 away.	 It	 felt	 tranquil, sheltered,	so	far	removed	from	the	horrors	I’d	seen	in	Albuquerque	that	I	might</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	well	have	been	on	another	planet. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>Here,	I	thought	I	might	be	able	to	heal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	I’d	taken	care	of	Dutchie	and	put	all	my	things	away,	stowing	the	guns</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	a	shelf	in	the	master	bedroom	closet,	I	treated	myself	to	a	long,	hot	shower. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	it	was	hot,	thanks	to	the	solar	water	heater.	The	storms	I’d	feared	might	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">moving	 in	 had	 never	 materialized,	 and	 the	 day	 was	 sun	 and	 shadow,	 but	 with enough	 sunlight	 to	 keep	 everything	 in	 the	 house	 running.	 I	 soaked	 in	 that shower,	 letting	 the	 water	 run	 over	 me,	 allowing	 it	 to	 wash	 away	 the	 terror	 and fear	and	tragedy	I’d	left	in	a	place	I	could	no	longer	think	of	as	home.	I	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">never	be	able	to	forget	any	of	it,	but	now,	for	the	first	time,	I	thought	I	might	be able	to	focus	on	what	lay	ahead,	instead	of	what	was	behind	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 softest	 rugs	 in	 the	 world	 had	 been	 laid	 down	 over	 the	 tile	 in	 the bathroom,	 and	 I	 got	 out	 and	 dried	 myself	 off,	 using	 the	 equally	 soft	 towels hanging	 from	 the	 rack.	 If	 the	 owner	 of	 this	 place	 truly	 had	 been	 a	 real	 estate developer,	it	was	obvious	that	he’d	spared	no	expense	in	outfitting	his	survival</p>
<p class="calibre1">getaway.	I	had	to	wonder	if	he’d	actually	ever	been	here,	or	merely	hired	people</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 build	 and	 decorate	 the	 place	 to	 his	 specifications.	 Something	 about	 it	 did feel…well,	 not	 exactly	 soulless,	 because	 it	 was	 too	 warm	 and	 inviting	 for	 that, but	 staged,	 maybe,	 as	 if	 an	 interior	 designer	 had	 done	 all	 the	 heavy	 lifting	 in making	 the	 decorating	 decisions.	 And	 had	 the	 developer	 intended	 to	 bring someone	with	him	to	share	the	world	after	the	apocalypse,	or	had	he	planned	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">live	in	all	this	luxury	alone? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever	 the	 case,	 it	 was	 certainly	 far,	 far	 more	 than	 I	 ever	 could	 have expected	might	be	awaiting	me	at	the	end	of	my	journey.	I	blotted	my	hair,	found</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	hair	dryer	in	one	of	the	drawers	in	the	vanity	area,	and	experienced	the	luxury</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	actually	being	able	to	blow-dry	my	hair,	something	I’d	thought	I’d	never	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">able	to	do	again.	I	put	on	clean	clothes	and	my	flats,	since	I	wasn’t	planning	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">go	hiking	anytime	soon.	The	next	day,	I’d	roam	around	and	explore	the	property</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoroughly,	but	for	now	I	was	content	to	cocoon	indoors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	emerged	into	the	family	room,	the	voice	asked,  <i class="calibre3">Are	you	feeling	better</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">now? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Much,”	 I	 replied,	 although	 I	 couldn’t	 help	 wondering	 how	 much	 it	 could see.	Had	it	been	spying	on	me	in	the	shower? </p>
<p class="calibre1">No,	that	was	ridiculous.	And	it	had	been	polite	enough	to	wait	to	address	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">until	I	was	in	one	of	the	more	public	areas	of	the	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	going	to	make	some	dinner,”	I	added.	“You	want	anything?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	one	of	those	sounds	that	might	have	been	a	chuckle.  <i class="calibre3">No,	thank	you. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">But	do	enjoy	exploring	the	kitchen. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In	that	moment,	it	seemed	as	if	the	voice	had	gone	again…if	it	could	ever	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	to	actually	be	 <i class="calibre3">here</i>	in	the	corporeal	sense	of	the	word. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>I	went	on	into	the	kitchen,	where	Dutchie	greeted	me	with	a	thumping	tail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had	she	been	here	the	whole	time,	waiting	to	see	if	I	would	come	back	and	make</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	people	food? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently	so,	because	the	second	I	opened	one	package	of	sausages,	her	tail</p>
<p class="calibre1">began	wagging	even	more	fiercely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	not	for	dogs,”	I	told	her	in	the	severest	tones	I	could	muster,	but	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	smiled	up	at	me	and	cocked	her	head.	Well,	that	had	never	worked	on	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">old	dog	Sadie,	either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 could	 have	 nuked	 the	 sausages,	 but	 for	 some	 reason	 it	 felt	 better	 to	 rustle out	 a	 skillet	 and	 cook	 them	 the	 old-fashioned	 way.	 The	 savory	 smell	 filled	 the kitchen,	and	my	stomach	rumbled.	After	digging	around	in	the	freezer,	I	located</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	frozen	home-style	potatoes	and	added	them	to	the	mix.	Yes,	I	really	needed</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	fresh	fruit	or	vegetables,	but	right	then	I	was	suddenly	too	tired	to	bother</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	going	out	to	the	greenhouse.	It	could	wait	another	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	 I	 did	 find,	 tucked	 under	 one	 of	 the	 counters,	 was	 a	 wine	 refrigerator. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	 you,	 Mr.	 Real	 Estate	 Developer,”	 I	 breathed,	 looking	 at	 the	 gleaming bottles,	all	chilled	to	a	perfect	fifty-four	degrees.	Not	that	I	knew	the	first	thing about	wine,	but	I	did	know	about	needing	a	drink,	and	boy,	did	I	need	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	selected	a	Black	Mesa	Montepulciano.	I	had	no	idea	what	a	Montepulciano</p>
<p class="calibre1">even	 was,	 but	 it	 sounded	 exotic.	 Probably	 far	 too	 exotic	 for	 my	 prosy	 meal	 of sausages	and	potatoes,	which	were	still	happily	sizzling	away	on	the	stove	top, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	I	doubted	anyone	from	 <i class="calibre3">Wine	 Spectator</i>	 magazine	 was	 going	 to	 drop	 in	 and grade	me	on	my	wine	pairings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 a	 drawer	 seemingly	 dedicated	 only	 to	 wine	 openers	 and	 related gadgets	 —	 stoppers,	 little	 metal	 collars	 with	 padding	 inside	 to	 keep	 wine	 from dripping	down	the	side	of	a	bottle	after	it	had	been	opened.	I’d	never	been	able</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 manage	 a	 waiter-style	 corkscrew,	 but	 there	 was	 also	 one	 of	 those	 “jumping jack”–style	 openers,	 and	 I	 selected	 that	 and	 went	 to	 work	 on	 the	 wine	 bottle, keeping	an	eye	on	the	potatoes	and	sausages	the	whole	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sound	of	a	cork	coming	out	a	wine	bottle	has	to	be	one	of	the	happiest</p>
<p class="calibre1">sounds	 in	 the	 world,	 and	 I	 thought	 I	 could	 use	 a	 little	 happiness	 right	 then.	 I pulled	 one	 of	 the	 heavy	 blown-glass	 goblets	 out	 of	 the	 cupboard	 and	 filled	 it approximately	halfway.	Everything	I’d	read	and	heard	said	you	were	supposed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">let	wine	breathe,	but	I	wasn’t	going	to	bother	with	that.	I	took	a	sip	and	closed</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	eyes.	No,	I	hadn’t	been	much	of	a	wine	drinker,	had	always	ordered	mixed</p>
<p class="calibre1">drinks	or	tequila	shots	when	I	was	out	with	my	friends.	Now,	though,	I	started	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand	the	appeal	of	wine,	the	smooth	darkness	of	it	on	my	lips,	the	gentle</p>
<p class="calibre1">warmth	it	seemed	to	spread	through	my	limbs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	allowed	myself	another	sip,	then	went	back	to	the	stove	so	I	could	turn	over</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>the	sausages	and	stir	the	potatoes	around	a	little.	They	were	basically	done,	so	I scrounged	in	the	cupboard	for	a	plate	and	dumped	everything	onto	it.	Dutchie’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">tail	began	to	wag	frantically,	and	I	couldn’t	help	smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	we’ll	see	if	there’s	anything	left	over,”	I	told	her,	then	got	out	a	knife</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	fork,	picked	up	my	goblet	of	wine,	and	went	into	the	family	room.	No	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 I	 going	 to	 be	 the	 only	 person	 sitting	 down	 at	 that	 massive	 copper	 dining room	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 the	 family	 room	 was	 a	 much	 cozier	 space,	 and	 I	 settled	 myself	 on	 the couch	and	placed	the	plate	of	food	and	my	wine	glass	on	the	coffee	table.	A	flat-screen	 TV	 hung	 on	 one	 wall,	 although	 it	 wasn’t	 going	 to	 do	 me	 much	 good unless	 the	 real	 estate	 developer	 had	 a	 stash	 of	 DVDs	 hidden	 somewhere.	 He probably	did,	but	in	that	moment	I	was	too	hungry	to	worry	about	it.	As	with	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">many	other	things,	I’d	go	exploring	later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	also	a	kiva-style	fireplace	in	one	corner,	with	a	nice	stack	of	wood</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	a	basket	next	to	it.	After	I	was	done	eating,	I	thought	I	might	light	a	fire	and allow	myself	to	simply	sit	here	for	a	while,	quiet,	letting	my	food	digest.	Hell, </p>
<p class="calibre1">maybe	 I’d	 even	 drink	 that	 whole	 bottle	 of	 wine.	 After	 everything	 I’d	 been through,	getting	drunk	sounded	like	it	might	not	be	a	half-bad	idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 no…I	 knew	 I	 wouldn’t	 do	 that.	 Just	 the	 glass,	 and	 maybe	 half	 of	 one afterward.	The	voice	had	reassured	me	I	was	safe	here,	and	had	closed	the	gate</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	compound	behind	me,	but	until	I’d	slept	a	few	nights	unmolested,	I	wasn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	to	let	my	guard	down	like	that.	Dutchie	had	proven	to	be	a	good	watchdog, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	had	a	feeling	a	place	like	this	had	some	decent	built-in	security,	but	even</p>
<p class="calibre1">so,	being	careless	seemed	like	a	good	way	to	get	myself	killed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead,	 I	 drank	 the	 wine	 slowly,	 taking	 small	 sips	 in	 between	 bites	 of	 my food,	 until	 my	 glass	 was	 empty	 and	 my	 plate	 almost	 so.	 There	 were	 a	 few potatoes	and	the	end	of	one	sausage	left,	and	I	put	the	plate	down	on	the	floor	so Dutchie	 could	 have	 the	 rest	 of	 it.	 Who	 cared	 if	 that	 wasn’t	 the	 most	 hygienic thing	 in	 the	 world	 to	 do?	 She	 was	 deliriously	 happy	 about	 getting	 some	 table scraps,	and	as	far	as	I	was	concerned,	she’d	earned	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	she’d	polished	the	plate	clean,	I	picked	it	up,	as	well	as	my	wine	glass, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 went	 back	 to	 the	 kitchen.	 The	 plate	 went	 in	 the	 dishwasher,	 and	 I	 poured enough	wine	into	my	goblet	to	get	it	to	a	little	below	the	halfway	mark.	In	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">drawer	with	all	the	other	wine	accoutrements,	I	found	a	stopper,	so	I	jammed	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	the	open	bottle,	figuring	I’d	finish	it	off	the	next	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 although	 I	 was	 bone-tired,	 sitting	 in	 front	 of	 the	 fire	 didn’t	 seem	 so appealing	after	all.	I	might	as	well	get	more	of	a	handle	on	this	place	that	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	supposed	to	be	my	home.	Going	back	to	the	family	room,	I	discovered	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	large	carved	cabinet	placed	up	against	one	wall	did	in	fact	hold	the	real	estate</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>developer’s	 Blu-Ray	 collection.	 Most	 of	 it	 was	 fairly	 typical	 new-release	 stuff, with	some	action	classics	thrown	in.	There	was	also	an	entire	shelf	of	porn,	and	I just	had	to	laugh	when	I	looked	at	it.	It	was	pretty	obvious	what	he’d	intended	to do	 with	 at	 least	 some	 of	 his	 time	 after	 surviving	 the	 zombie	 apocalypse,	 or whatever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	closed	the	cabinet	with	one	hand,	lifted	the	wine	goblet	with	the	other	so	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	take	a	drink,	and	wandered	off	down	the	hallway	that	led	to	the	bedrooms</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 the	 office.	 That	 was	 the	 space	 which	 really	 interested	 me	 the	 most.	 After flicking	 on	 the	 light	 —	 and	 marveling	 at	 how	 easy	 that	 was	 —	 I	 went	 into	 the room	and	took	a	quick	survey.	Again,	the	furniture	here	was	dark	distressed	oak, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a	perfect	match	to	the	hacienda-style	feel	of	the	rest	of	the	house.	One	wall	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">mainly	 window,	 covered	 in	 wooden	 shutters.	 Against	 another	 wall	 was	 a	 large desk	with	what	looked	like	a	brand-new	iMac	sitting	on	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	also	a	gun	safe.	I	set	down	my	wine	glass	on	the	desk,	then	went</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	to	the	safe	and	tested	the	lock.	I	suppose	it	was	silly	to	think	that	the	thing would	have	been	open,	but	I	couldn’t	help	experiencing	a	stab	of	disappointment</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	 the	 doors	 wouldn’t	 budge.	 My	 father	 had	 trained	 me	 not	 to	 leave	 guns lying	around,	and	although	I	was	sure	they	would	be	fine	where	I’d	put	them	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	shelf	in	the	closet,	I’d	feel	even	better	if	I	could	lock	them	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sitting	next	to	the	desk	was	a	file	cabinet,	and	I	opened	that,	quickly	rifling</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	its	contents.	This	was	a	trove	—	I	found	manuals	for	the	computer,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">drip	setup	in	the	greenhouse,	all	the	appliances,	the	security	system.	That	seemed to	feed	into	the	iMac,	so	I	touched	the	space	bar	on	the	keyboard,	waking	it	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	its	sleep.	Thank	God	it	didn’t	seem	to	be	password	protected;	I	was	able	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">find	the	security	program	easily	enough,	which	brought	up	a	feed	from	a	number</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	cameras.	At	the	moment	it	was	showing	a	grid	of	all	nine	of	them,	although	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared	 that	 I	 could	 also	 expand	 one	 image	 and	 then	 rotate	 through	 them	 if	 I preferred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	that	it	mattered	one	way	or	another,	as	far	as	I	could	tell.	By	then	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">completely	 dark,	 and	 the	 cameras	 didn’t	 show	 much	 of	 anything.	 I	 supposed	 it made	 sense	 not	 to	 have	 security	 lights	 blaring	 around	 the	 exterior	 of	 the	 house and	the	perimeter	of	the	property;	that	would	only	serve	as	a	beacon	to	show	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone	was	living	out	here.	And	actually,	after	I	toggled	around	a	bit,	I	realized that	 no	 lights	 were	 needed,	 as	 the	 cameras	 switched	 into	 infrared	 mode	 in	 the dark.	Pretty	high-tech. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	 much	 had	 the	 developer	 spent	 building	 this	 place?	 I	 couldn’t	 begin	 to guess,	 but	 it	 had	 to	 be	 at	 least	 a	 million	 dollars.	 And	 all	 for	 nothing…well,	 at least	 where	 he	 was	 concerned.	 I	 was	 more	 than	 grateful	 that	 the	 house	 existed, and	that	the	voice	had	found	it	for	me,	but	it	still	seemed	somewhat	ironic	that	so</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>much	money	had	been	spent	to	defend	against	something	which	ended	up	having no	defense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 thought	 sobered	 me,	 and	 I	 picked	 up	 my	 goblet	 and	 took	 a	 large</p>
<p class="calibre1">swallow	of	wine.	Dutchie	had	followed	me	in	here,	settling	down	on	the	floor	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 little	 ball.	 There	 was	 something	 almost	 resigned	 about	 her	 posture,	 as	 if	 she knew	that	once	a	human	being	started	mucking	around	on	a	computer,	they	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	to	be	useless	for	a	good	number	of	hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	that	wasn’t	why	I’d	come	in	here.	I	only	wanted	to	know	what	the	room</p>
<p class="calibre1">held,	and	now	that	I’d	seen	the	kind	of	security	that	was	protecting	this	place,	I felt	a	good	deal	better.	Had	the	system	been	on	when	I	got	here,	and	the	voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 simply	 disengaged	 it	 to	 allow	 me	 to	 enter,	 or	 had	 he	 switched	 it	 on	 once	 I was	safely	inside	the	compound?	He’d	clearly	intended	for	me	to	come	here	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">along,	 so	 I	 had	 a	 feeling	 it	 was	 probably	 the	 former.	 There	 hadn’t	 been	 much chance	of	someone	accidentally	stumbling	across	this	place,	but	even	so,	better</p>
<p class="calibre1">safe	than	otherwise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among	the	manuals	was	the	guide	that	had	come	with	the	gun	safe.	I	flipped</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	it	with	one	hand,	sipping	from	my	wine	glass	at	the	same	time.	When	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">got	to	the	last	page,	I	saw	that	some	numbers	had	been	written	down	along	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">edge	of	that	leaf.	The	combination? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only	one	way	to	find	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 put	 down	 the	 wine	 glass	 and	 went	 over	 to	 the	 safe,	 then	 slowly	 spun	 the dial	 around	 to	 match	 the	 sequence	 of	 numbers	 I’d	 found	 inside	 the	 manual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	soft	click,	and	the	door	opened	outward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	though	I’d	grown	up	around	my	father’s	arsenal,	I	couldn’t	help	letting</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	a	gasp	at	what	I	found.	There	was	—	well,	an	arsenal	worthy	of	holding	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	entire	horde	of	zombies.	Shotguns	and	rifles	and	a	parade	of	handguns,	along</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 box	 after	 box	 of	 ammo.	 The	 problem	 wouldn’t	 be	 defending	 this	 place	 if necessary,	but	deciding	which	gun	to	use	to	do	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	that	and	trying	to	squeeze	my	own	meager	collection	in	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 closed	 the	 safe,	 reclaimed	 my	 wine	 glass,	 and	 finished	 the	 rest	 of	 it	 with one	swallow.	After	that,	I	took	the	empty	glass	with	me	and	performed	a	quick</p>
<p class="calibre1">inspection	 of	 the	 other	 rooms.	 Nothing	 out	 of	 the	 ordinary,	 just	 bedrooms decorated	 with	 the	 same	 taste	 and	 flair	 as	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 house.	 Another bathroom,	 not	 quite	 as	 luxurious	 as	 the	 one	 in	 the	 master	 suite,	 but	 still	 large enough	that	two	people	could	comfortably	brush	their	teeth	in	there	or	perform</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	 bathroom	 prep	 as	 necessary.	 It	 seemed	 sort	 of	 a	 shame	 to	 waste	 all	 this space	 on	 me,	 but	 truthfully,	 so	 far	 I	 hadn’t	 come	 across	 any	 survivors	 I’d	 be willing	to	share	this	house	with.	Yes,	there	had	to	be	some	good	people	who’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	it	through	the	Heat	unscathed.	I	sure	hadn’t	seen	them	yet,	though. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>Suddenly	 feeling	 even	 more	 tired,	 I	 headed	 back	 to	 the	 kitchen	 so	 I	 could rinse	out	my	wine	glass	and	set	it	on	the	counter.	For	the	first	time,	I	noticed	a door	off	to	one	side;	I	opened	it	and	saw	it	concealed	the	laundry	room,	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 large	 and	 well	 laid	 out	 as	 well,	 with	 a	 state-of-the-art	 washer	 and	 dryer combo,	 as	 well	 as	 plenty	 of	 storage	 and	 a	 separate	 wash	 tub	 for	 scrubbing	 out stubborn	 stains,	 or	 whatever.	 Inside	 the	 cupboards	 I	 found	 what	 looked	 like	 a lifetime	 supply	 of	 detergent,	 along	 with	 all	 the	 spare	 towels	 and	 sheets	 for	 the various	bathrooms	and	bedrooms.	It	seemed	clear	that	the	developer	hadn’t	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">worried	 about	 the	 appliances	 using	 up	 too	 much	 of	 the	 power	 the	 solar	 farm produced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	 if	 he	 hadn’t	 worried	 about	 it,	 then	 I	 wouldn’t	 worry,	 either,	 when	 the time	came.	Right	now	I	had	enough	clothes	to	last	me	another	week,	so	laundry</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t	exactly	a	concern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 master	 bedroom	 had	 its	 own	 kiva	 fireplace,	 and	 I	 decided	 it	 would	 be better	to	have	a	fire	there.	Having	a	fireplace	in	my	own	bedroom	felt	deliciously decadent,	 and	 the	 thought	 of	 having	 the	 flames	 there	 to	 warm	 me	 through	 the night	seemed	extra	appealing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 I	 brushed	 my	 teeth	 but	 didn’t	 worry	 about	 my	 face,	 since	 I’d	 taken	 a shower	only	a	few	hours	earlier,	and	then	got	some	logs	from	the	basket	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">floor	near	the	hearth	and	made	a	stack	the	way	my	father	had	shown	me.	There</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 a	 lighter	 on	 a	 shelf	 nearby,	 so	 I	 used	 that	 to	 get	 things	 going.	 Dutchie watched	 all	 this	 with	 some	 bemusement,	 but	 once	 the	 fire	 got	 crackling	 away and	began	to	spread	its	heat	through	the	room,	she	let	out	a	contented	little	sigh and	curled	up	on	the	rug,	her	eyes	closing	almost	immediately. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I	 know	 how	 you	 feel,	 Dutchie, </i>	 I	 thought.	 Even	 so,	 something	 in	 me	 was reluctant	to	turn	off	the	bedside	lamp,	as	if,	once	I	had	done	so,	I’d	never	be	able to	get	the	light	back.	Silly,	I	knew.	It	wouldn’t	even	be	fully	dark	with	the	lamp shut	off,	as	the	fire	was	certainly	adequate	to	illuminate	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still,	I	sat	there	on	the	bed	for	a	long	time,	looking	at	the	glow	of	the	lamp	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 bedroom’s	 warm	 terra-cotta-painted	 walls,	 at	 the	 gold	 leaf	 detailing	 on	 the wall	where	the	door	was	located.	Everything	felt	cozy	and	quiet	and	safe,	and	yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	some	reason	I	couldn’t	bring	myself	to	reach	over	to	the	lamp	and	turn	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">knob.	 Finally,	 I	 got	 up	 off	 the	 bed,	 went	 to	 the	 closet,	 and	 retrieved	 the	 Smith and	 Wesson	 revolver	 from	 the	 shelf.	 I	 laid	 it	 on	 the	 table	 next	 to	 the	 bed,	 then took	a	deep	breath	and	shut	off	the	lamp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	wasn’t	dark.	The	room	danced	with	firelight,	and	wasn’t	even	completely</p>
<p class="calibre1">silent,	between	the	crackling	of	the	logs	and	Dutchie’s	soft	snores.	I	settled	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">head	 against	 the	 pillow,	 breathing	 in	 the	 indefinable	 scent	 of	 clean	 linens.	 Had the	caretaker	put	fresh	sheets	on	the	bed	when	he’d	come	by	a	few	days	earlier? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a>It	certainly	seemed	that	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 I	 didn’t	 want	 to	 think	 about	 that,	 because	 then	 I’d	 think	 about	 how	 he was	dead,	and	the	man	who’d	built	this	house,	and	Elena	and	Tori	and	my	aunt</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	uncle…my	mother	and	father.	Devin.	Even	as	I	tried	to	push	those	thoughts</p>
<p class="calibre1">away,	 I	 could	 feel	 the	 telltale	 lump	 in	 my	 throat	 that	 meant	 I	 was	 dangerously close	to	bursting	into	sobs. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Don’t	cry, </i>	 I	 told	 myself.  <i class="calibre3">Don’t.	 It	 won’t	 bring	 them	 back.	 All	 you	 can	 do	 is</i> <i class="calibre3">keep	living,	so	there’ll	still	be	someone	around	to	remember	them. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 first	 glance,	 that	 notion	 might	 not	 have	 seemed	 very	 reassuring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow,	though,	it	did	calm	me,	and	I	found	myself	falling	asleep,	succumbing</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	last	to	the	weariness	of	the	day	and	the	softness	of	the	bed	in	which	I	lay.	The last	thing	I	heard	was	a	soft	 <i class="calibre3">pop</i>	from	the	hearth	as	a	log	split	and	settled	down on	top	of	the	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	 never	 been	 much	 for	 dreaming.	 That	 is,	 I	 knew	 I	 must	 dream,	 because everyone	did,	but	I	hardly	ever	remembered	any	of	those	dreams.	I	was	never	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	 recounting	 in	 excruciating	 detail	 my	 crazy	 dreams	 about	 flying	 or	 driving my	 car	 up	 the	 side	 of	 a	 building,	 or	 whatever.	 And	 I	 certainly	 never	 had	  <i class="calibre3">those</i> kinds	of	dreams,	the	kind	you	awake	from	all	hot	and	bothered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	did	that	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	dreamed	I	lay	in	that	bed,	with	the	warm	glow	of	the	fire	flickering	against</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	walls	and	the	comforting	scent	of	wood	smoke	in	the	air.	The	strange	thing</p>
<p class="calibre1">was,	I	dreamed	that	I	slept,	and	that	I	awoke	to	strong	arms	around	me,	holding</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	close,	and	someone	kissing	me.	In	my	dream,	I	didn’t	think	that	was	strange</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	all.	I	opened	my	mouth	to	this	dream	man,	tasted	the	sweetness	of	his	lips,	felt him	release	me	from	the	embrace	so	he	could	caress	my	body,	even	as	I	reached</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	to	touch	him,	to	feel	his	arousal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 it	 seemed	 so	 natural	 for	 him	 to	 press	 me	 down	 into	 the	 bed,	 to	 push himself	into	me	so	that	we	were	moving	together,	my	legs	wrapped	around	him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">driving	 him	 farther	 into	 me.	 This	 was	 all	 done	 in	 complete	 silence;	 only	 when the	 orgasm	 hit	 did	 I	 finally	 cry	 out,	 but	 softly.	 And	 he	 said	 nothing	 at	 all, although	I	could	feel	the	climax	shudder	through	him	as	well.	We	stilled,	lying	in bed,	our	breaths	filling	the	silence.	Then	his	lips	brushed	against	my	cheek,	and	I heard	him	whisper,  <i class="calibre3">Beloved</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 sat	 up	 in	 bed	 then,	 heart	 racing,	 and	 pressed	 my	 palms	 flat	 against	 the mattress.	 Shaking,	 I	 put	 one	 hand	 to	 my	 chest.	 Unlike	 in	 the	 dream,	 I	 was	 still dressed,	wearing	the	sleep	shirt	I’d	put	on	before	I	went	in	to	brush	my	teeth.	My mouth	 tasted	 of	 mint,	 not…him.	 And	 I	 could	 tell	 that	 no	 one	 had	 touched	 me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Things	didn’t…feel…any	different. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	a	dream.	A	horribly	vivid	dream.	In	a	way,	I	could	even	understand	it.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>was	feeling	alone,	and	the	voice	had	been	my	only	real	companion	for	the	past few	days.	All	right,	I	had	Dutchie,	but	that	wasn’t	exactly	the	same	thing.	Was	it so	strange	for	my	subconscious	mind	to	turn	that	disembodied	voice	into	a	sort</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 dream	 lover,	 someone	 to	 make	 me	 feel	 as	 if	 I	 weren’t	 the	 only	 person	 left alive	on	the	planet? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	 not,	 but	 I	 still	 felt	 shaken	 to	 my	 core.	 I	 pushed	 back	 the	 sheets	 and blankets	and	duvet,	then	crawled	out	of	bed	and	went	to	the	bathroom.	There,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">splashed	water	on	my	face,	trying	to	calm	myself,	and	telling	myself	I	should	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">glad	that	I	was	someplace	where	I	had	the	luxury	of	running	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 no-nonsense	 thought	 did	 help	 me	 to	 regain	 my	 composure	 somewhat, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	headed	into	the	bedroom	after	that,	pausing	to	put	another	couple	of	logs</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 fire	 and	 stir	 it	 up	 a	 bit	 with	 the	 poker	 before	 finally	 returning	 to	 bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through	all	of	this,	Dutchie	had	slept	peacefully,	apparently	not	discommoded	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	by	my	wandering	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	got	back	in	bed,	then	pulled	in	a	deep	breath,	and	another.	After	everything</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	been	through,	was	I	really	going	to	let	a	dream	rattle	me?	I	told	myself	that	I needed	to	let	it	go,	that	everything	would	be	fine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	just	wasn’t	sure	whether	I	believed	those	reassurances. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a><img src="index-108_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="index-108_2.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">TEN</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	spent	 the	 next	 few	 days	 really	 getting	 myself	 accustomed	 to	 the	 property	 and everything	on	it	—	the	greenhouse,	the	solar	farm,	even	the	garage,	which	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">hiding	 a	 Polaris	 ATV	 in	 the	 farthest	 bay.	 When	 I	 found	 that,	 it	 somehow	 made me	miss	my	father	even	more.	He’d	always	wanted	one,	but	a	vehicle	intended</p>
<p class="calibre1">solely	for	off-roading	was	a	luxury	that	just	hadn’t	been	in	the	family	budget. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 the	 voice	 had	 told	 me,	 there	 was	 a	 good	 deal	 of	 food	 stored	 in	 the basement.	 Scratch	 that;	 there	 was	 enough	 food	 down	 there	 to	 satisfy	 the	 most rabid	 prepper,	 shelf	 after	 shelf	 of	 canned	 goods	 and	 staples	 such	 as	 flour	 and sugar	and	cooking	oil,	and	enough	spices	that	I	could	probably	bake	something</p>
<p class="calibre1">different	every	day	for	the	next	year	and	still	not	use	everything	up.	In	fact,	the basement	was	so	extensive	that	I	got	the	impression	it	was	actually	bigger	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	house	itself,	spreading	beyond	the	walls	of	the	structure	directly	above	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	greenhouse	was	set	up	on	a	drip	system,	one	supplied	by	the	same	well</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	gave	the	house	its	water.	I	found	a	good	deal	of	produce	that	was	at	its	peak or	even	just	past	it,	so	I	harvested	that	as	best	I	could,	eating	what	needed	to	be consumed	right	away	and	putting	the	rest	in	the	refrigerator.	On	the	bookshelves</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 office,	 there	 were	 a	 number	 of	 reference	 books	 on	 all	 sorts	 of	 topics	 of interest	 to	 the	 homesteader	 or	 survivalist	 —	 home	 canning,	 sewing,	 weaving, butchering…even	how	to	make	your	own	bullets.	In	fact,	I	found	the	molds	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	very	activity	down	in	the	basement,	along	with	a	quantity	of	black	powder</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a>and	other	supplies.	I	had	to	hope	none	of	it	would	explode	and	send	Dutchie	and me	sky-high	one	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although	 having	 every	 conceivable	 supply	 on	 hand	 should	 have	 made	 me</p>
<p class="calibre1">feel	better,	in	truth	it	only	depressed	me.	I	thought	of	being	here	so	long	that	I would	have	to	start	canning	food	or	sewing	my	own	clothes,	of	having	to	go	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	ATV	to	hunt	deer	or	elk.	Even	though	my	father	had	taken	me	hunting	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">few	times,	I’d	never	had	the	heart	to	pull	the	trigger.	Maybe	if	I	were	starving	I’d feel	 differently	 about	 the	 whole	 thing,	 but	 until	 then	 I	 couldn’t	 conceive	 of killing	something	so	beautiful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	one	thing	the	compound	didn’t	have	was	dog	food.	I	wasn’t	sure	what	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	 of	 that;	 maybe	 Mr.	 Real	 Estate	 Developer	 wasn’t	 a	 dog	 person,	 although you’d	think	he	would’ve	factored	dogs	into	his	survival	plan,	just	because	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	good	to	have	around	in	case	things	got	dicey.	Whatever	the	reason,	I	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	to	about	a	day’s	worth	of	dry	food	left	for	Dutchie,	which	meant	I	needed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	go	foraging. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	some	reason,	the	voice	had	been	fairly	scarce	the	past	couple	of	days.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wondered	 at	 its	 absence,	 thinking	 that	 maybe	 it	 believed	 its	 work	 was	 done, since	it	had	gotten	me	here	safely.	All	the	same,	I	thought	I’d	better	telegraph	my plans,	let	it	know	I	was	leaving	the	compound	for	a	few	hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dutchie’s	 almost	 out	 of	 food,”	 I	 said	 as	 I	 got	 the	 shotgun	 out	 of	 the	 gun safe.	 I	 already	 wore	 a	 gleaming	 Ruger	 in	 a	 holster	 on	 my	 hip,	 said	 armament courtesy	 of	 the	 trove	 I’d	 found	 within	 that	 safe.	 Possibly	 it	 would	 have	 made better	sense	to	take	along	a	gun	I	was	more	familiar	with,	but	I	couldn’t	resist	the chrome-plated	 allure	 of	 that	 Ruger.	 My	 father	 would	 have	 known	 how	 much	 it cost,	but	I	didn’t	have	a	clue.	A	lot,	that’s	for	sure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence	met	my	announcement,	so	I	went	on,	“I’m	going	down	into	Santa	Fe</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	a	few	hours.	Can	I	assume	the	coast	is	clear?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing	again,	and	I	frowned.	But	since	I’d	seen	more	clouds	massing	up	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	northeast,	I	didn’t	want	to	dilly-dally.	Maybe	twenty	minutes	in	and	twenty</p>
<p class="calibre1">minutes	out;	I’d	actually	seen	a	PetSmart	down	a	side	street	as	I	was	making	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	along	Cerrillos	Road	when	I	came	into	town,	so	at	least	I	wouldn’t	have	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">waste	a	lot	of	time	looking	for	a	pet	store.	Having	no	cell	service	and	no	way	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">look	 anything	 up	 on	 the	 Internet	 definitely	 made	 what	 should	 have	 been	 easy tasks	a	lot	more	difficult. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	a	shrug,	I	closed	the	safe	and	locked	it,	then	headed	out	to	the	kitchen.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">really	didn’t	need	anything	else	in	the	way	of	supplies,	although	the	chilliness	of the	 nights	 even	 now,	 in	 early	 October,	 told	 me	 that	 the	 cold-weather	 gear	 I’d brought	along	might	not	be	sufficient	for	a	full-blown	Santa	Fe	winter.	Well,	if	I had	time	to	poke	around,	I’d	see	if	I	could	find	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>As	 I	 was	 getting	 ready,	 I	 debated	 whether	 to	 bring	 Dutchie	 along,	 and	 then decided	against	it.	She	was	safe	here,	and	I	knew	I’d	move	faster	if	I	didn’t	have her	 along.	 Besides,	 I	 needed	 someplace	 to	 stow	 the	 shotgun.	 I	 wasn’t	 sure	 if she’d	take	kindly	to	being	relegated	to	the	back	seat	so	the	shotgun	could…ride</p>
<p class="calibre1">shotgun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	patted	her	head,	got	her	some	fresh	water,	and	then	told	her	I’d	be	going	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 would	 be	 back	 soon.	 Since	 she’d	 gotten	 used	 to	 me	 coming	 and	 going between	 the	 house	 and	 the	 garage	 or	 the	 kitchen	 and	 the	 greenhouse,	 she	 took this	announcement	in	stride,	lapping	up	some	of	the	water	I’d	just	poured	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 settled	 down	 on	 the	 rug	 in	 front	 of	 the	 oven.	 That	 was	 one	 of	 her	 new favorite	spots,	which	made	things	sort	of	difficult	when	I	was	trying	to	cook. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Smiling,	 I	 went	 out	 the	 back	 door	 and	 made	 my	 way	 along	 the	 flagstone walk	to	the	garage.	In	my	explorations,	I’d	found	the	remotes	for	the	garage	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	front	gate,	so	technically	I	didn’t	need	the	voice	to	let	me	in	and	out.	Still,	I couldn’t	help	wondering	where	he’d	gotten	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 a	 shrug,	 I	 opened	 the	 garage	 door,	 then	 climbed	 into	 the	 Cherokee.	 I leaned	 the	 shotgun	 against	 the	 passenger	 seat,	 checked	 the	 fuel	 gauge,	 and backed	out,	glad	that	I	wouldn’t	have	to	worry	about	getting	more	gas	anytime</p>
<p class="calibre1">soon.	This	place	felt	like	it	was	out	in	the	middle	of	nowhere	—	and	it	was	—</p>
<p class="calibre1">but	I	doubted	it	was	more	than	five	miles	one	way	from	here	to	the	city	center.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	go	back	and	forth	at	least	twenty	more	times	before	I	had	to	bother	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">fueling	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dirt	track	hadn’t	improved	any	since	the	last	time	I’d	driven	over	it,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 gritted	 my	 teeth	 as	 I	 bounced	 and	 jounced	 along	 at	 a	 steady	 twenty	 miles	 an hour.	It	was	a	relief	to	hit	the	actual	road,	even	though	it	wasn’t	in	the	greatest shape,	 either.	 But	 at	 least	 here	 I	 could	 increase	 my	 speed	 to	 thirty,	 slowing occasionally	to	go	around	an	abandoned	truck	or	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing	had	changed.	I	wasn’t	sure	why	I’d	expected	it	to,	except	I	supposed</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	was	a	normal,	human	thing	to	think	—	the	world	around	us	had	never	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">static,	people	and	cars	coming	and	going,	shifting	their	positions.	Here,	though, </p>
<p class="calibre1">there	 were	 no	 more	 people	 left	 to	 change	 anything.	 Or	 rather,	 so	 few	 of	 them probably	remained	that	it	would	take	some	doing	to	run	into	any	of	them.	I	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	hazy	on	the	population	of	Santa	Fe	before	the	Heat	laid	everything	waste, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	I	had	a	feeling	there	couldn’t	be	more	than	a	hundred	or	so	people	left	in	the general	area,	if	even	that	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually,	 I	 backtracked	 my	 way	 to	 Cerrillos,	 then	 drove	 some	 distance</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	 the	 street	 before	 I	 spotted	 the	 PetSmart	 off	 to	 my	 left.	 I	 turned	 —	 going wide	 to	 avoid	 a	 Ford	 Explorer	 sitting	 right	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 intersection	 —</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 pulled	 into	 the	 store	 parking	 lot.	 There	 weren’t	 that	 many	 vehicles	 here, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>most	 likely	 because	 people	 had	 been	 thinking	 about	 other	 things	 than	 feeding their	pets	when	the	doomsday	disease	swept	through	town. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	went	inside,	my	father’s	heavy	police-issue	flashlight	in	one	hand,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 relieved	 to	 see	 that	 all	 the	 live	 small	 animals	 —	 the	 rats	 and	 mice	 and gerbils,	the	birds	and	lizards	and	snakes	—	had	apparently	flown	the	coop.	How</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’d	gotten	out,	I	had	no	idea,	unless	this	was	another	example	of	“being	taken</p>
<p class="calibre1">care	of,”	as	the	voice	had	assured	me	back	in	Albuquerque.	There	was	evidence</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	food	being	tampered	with,	but	although	anything	within	reach	of	a	large</p>
<p class="calibre1">dog’s	 muzzle	 seemed	 to	 be	 either	 gone	 or	 half-eaten,	 there	 were	 still	 bags	 and bags	on	the	upper	shelves.	I	got	a	shopping	cart	and	loaded	it	up,	took	it	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cherokee,	and	dumped	the	bags	there,	then	repeated	the	process	until	my	arms</p>
<p class="calibre1">ached	 and	 I	 wouldn’t	 be	 able	 to	 see	 out	 the	 back	 window	 if	 I	 kept	 it	 up	 any longer.	That	would	be	enough	to	see	Dutchie	through	the	winter,	and	after	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">—	well,	I’d	just	come	foraging	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	also	grabbed	a	miscellany	of	dog	treats	and	dog	toys	from	the	displays	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	front	of	the	store,	and	wedged	those	in	and	around	the	big	twenty-pound	bags</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	dog	food.	Dutchie	was	definitely	going	to	be	one	spoiled	doggie,	but	I	thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	deserved	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During	this	whole	process,	which	I	estimated	took	me	about	twenty	minutes</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 so,	 I	 didn’t	 see	 any	 evidence	 of	 anyone	 else	 being	 around.	 True,	 a	 pet	 store probably	 wasn’t	 the	 sort	 of	 place	 where	 survivors	 hung	 out,	 but	 I	 felt	 myself relax	a	little.	Maybe	this	was	why	the	voice	had	let	me	alone	—	it	had	known	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	nothing	to	fear	on	this	particular	trip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Humming	 to	 myself,	 I	 got	 back	 in	 the	 SUV	 and	 pointed	 it	 northward,	 back along	 the	 way	 I’d	 come.	 When	 I	 got	 to	 the	 intersection	 where	 I	 should	 have turned	 on	 Alameda	 to	 head	 back	 up	 into	 the	 hills,	 though,	 I	 found	 myself slowing	down,	and	then	cutting	left	so	I	could	drive	up	Don	Gaspar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Almost	at	once,	I	heard	the	voice	in	my	head.  <i class="calibre3">Jessica,	what	are	you	doing? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Relief	flooded	through	me.	So	I	hadn’t	been	completely	abandoned.	“I	want</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">See	what? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	center	of	town.	I	want	to	see	if	it’s	all	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Why	should	that	matter? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	 it	 matters,”	 I	 said,	 an	 edge	 of	 irritation	 in	 my	 voice.	 “It	 was	 a cultural	center.	Lots	of	museums,	historical	sites.	What	can	it	hurt	to	look?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence	for	a	few	seconds.  <i class="calibre3">You	may	not	like	what	you	see. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Ice	 etched	 its	 way	 down	 my	 spine,	 but	 I	 attempted	 to	 ignore	 it,	 instead asking,	“So	where	the	hell	have	you	been,	anyway?	The	Bahamas?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	didn’t	answer	directly,	but	said,  <i class="calibre3">You	missed	me? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>Did	 I	 want	 to	 admit	 that	 I	 had?	 Probably	 not.	 Hedging,	 I	 replied,	 “Well,	 I love	Dutchie,	but	she’s	not	the	world’s	greatest	conversationalist.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	heard	one	of	those	low	chuckles.  <i class="calibre3">You	may	be	right	in	that. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	what	he’d	just	said	about	my	not	liking	what	I	would	see,	I	couldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">help	smiling.	That	smile	faded	abruptly,	though,	as	I	came	around	the	corner	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Santa	Fe’s	famous	plaza.	In	good	weather	—	and	even	not-so-good	weather	—</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 plaza	 was	 usually	 full	 of	 people,	 whether	 tourists,	 musicians,	 vendors,	 or locals	out	to	get	some	air.	I’d	expected	it	to	be	empty.	What	I	hadn’t	expected	to see	 were	 the	 obvious	 signs	 of	 looting,	 of	 storefronts	 smashed	 in,	 merchandise scattered	across	the	sidewalk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mouth	 grim,	 I	 parked	 the	 Cherokee	 in	 a	 place	 that	 would	 have	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">heinously	 illegal	 a	 few	 days	 earlier,	 straddling	 the	 curb	 at	 the	 intersection	 of Palace	 Avenue	 and	 San	 Francisco	 Street.	 There	 really	 wasn’t	 anyplace	 else,	 as cars	still	lined	the	streets,	their	meters	run	out	long	ago.	I	didn’t	bother	to	look and	see	if	there	were	piles	of	gray	dust	inside	those	cars.	If	their	owners	had	died outside,	the	wind	would’ve	blown	their	remains	away	days	earlier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	understand,”	I	said.	“Why	would	people	loot	here?	Food	or	medical</p>
<p class="calibre1">supplies	I	can	understand,	but	expensive	jewelry	and	art?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I	don’t	know	for	certain.	Perhaps	they	were	attempting	to	assert	some	control</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">over	their	environment	as	everything	was	falling	apart. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	one	way	of	looking	at	it.	My	hiking	boot	hit	something	that	clinked</p>
<p class="calibre1">against	 the	 sidewalk,	 and	 I	 looked	 down	 to	 see	 that	 it	 was	 a	 heavy	 gold	 cuff bracelet	 studded	 with	 sapphires	 and	 diamonds.	 I	 thought	 I	 even	 knew	 which store	it	had	come	from,	because	it	was	a	place	where	Elena	and	Tori	and	I	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">pressed	our	noses	to	the	window	and	gawked	at	the	wares	inside,	trying	to	figure</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	how	anyone	would	pay	almost	fifty	grand	for	a	pair	of	earrings,	even	if	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">earrings	were	huge	drops	of	tanzanite	and	diamond	that	looked	as	if	they	should</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	at	the	Academy	Awards,	not	a	shop	window	in	Santa	Fe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	 thinking,	 I	 bent	 down	 and	 picked	 up	 the	 bracelet,	 then	 slid	 it	 onto my	wrist.	It	was	cold	against	my	skin;	the	day	had	turned	cloudy	and	dark,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">temperature	dropping	with	it.	I	even	thought	I	felt	the	first	spatter	of	a	raindrop or	two	against	my	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or	maybe	those	were	tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	saw	other	items	scattered	around	—	a	lone	earring,	a	trinket	box	of	carved</p>
<p class="calibre1">stone.	 For	 some	 reason,	 I	 began	 to	 pick	 them	 up,	 gathering	 everything	 I	 could find	 and	 then	 taking	 it	 into	 the	 nearest	 store,	 a	 shop	 that	 seemed	 to	 have specialized	in	high-end	western	gear.	It	had	been	hit,	too,	but	not	as	badly	as	the jewelry	stores. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again	the	voice	asked,  <i class="calibre3">Jessica,	what	are	you	doing? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>“What	does	it	look	like	I’m	doing?”	I	asked	angrily.	“I’m	cleaning	this	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	long	pause.  <i class="calibre3">Why? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	—	because	someone	loved	these	things	once.	Someone	made	them, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 someone	 chose	 them	 to	 sell	 in	 their	 store,	 and	 I	 don’t	 want	 them	 lying	 all over	the	place	like	garbage.	They	deserve	better	than	that.”	As	I	spoke,	I	realized that	tears	were	running	down	my	cheeks,	dripping	bitter	salt	into	my	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	it	spoke	again,	the	voice	was	very	gentle.  <i class="calibre3">My	dear,	they	are	just	things. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	that!”	I	raged.	“But	I	also	know	they’re	the	only	things	 <i class="calibre3">left! </i>	So	I’m not	going	to	leave	them	here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence	again.	Then,  <i class="calibre3">Jessica,	do	not	distress	yourself	so.	I	will	take	care	of	it. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 don’t	 even	 know	 how	 to	 describe	 what	 happened	 next.	 A	 wind	 came</p>
<p class="calibre1">swirling	out	of	nowhere,	seeming	to	come	in	and	pick	up	all	the	detritus	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">square	—	baskets	and	rugs	and	loose	bits	of	jewelry	and	hats	and	paintings	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">pots,	 everything	 that	 had	 been	 scattered	 on	 the	 ground	 during	 the	 looting.	 It coalesced	 into	 a	 cloud	 of	 debris,	 snaking	 through	 the	 air	 and	 rushing	 into	 the open	door	of	a	shop,	then	slamming	it	shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blinking,	 I	 stared	 at	 the	 streets	 around	 me,	 saw	 how	 they	 were	 clear	 of everything	except	a	few	scattered	leaves,	all	evidence	of	chaos	gone	as	if	it	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">never	existed.	Somehow,	I	managed	to	find	my	voice.	“That	—	that	was	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Yes</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But…why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I	do	not	like	seeing	you	in	distress. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">What	could	I	possibly	say	to	that?	I	swallowed,	my	throat	dry.	The	air	around</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	was	still	once	more,	heavy	and	cold.	Again	I	felt	the	stinging	touch	of	rain</p>
<p class="calibre1">sharp	against	my	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,”	I	managed	at	last. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Go	home,	beloved. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 nodded,	 then	 made	 myself	 turn	 around	 and	 go	 back	 to	 the	 Cherokee,	 to climb	behind	the	wheel	and	turn	the	key	in	the	ignition.	Perhaps	there	was	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">damage	beyond	the	plaza,	but	I	didn’t	want	to	look.	I’d	seen	enough	for	one	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 trip	 home	 was	 uneventful,	 though,	 and	 in	 a	 way	 it	 felt	 good	 to	 busy myself	with	hauling	all	those	bags	of	dog	food	out	of	the	back	of	the	SUV	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">storing	 them	 in	 the	 basement,	 save	 for	 one	 that	 I	 shoved	 into	 a	 corner	 of	 the pantry.	I	also	got	out	a	chewy	treat	and	gave	it	to	Dutchie,	who	wagged	her	tail</p>
<p class="calibre1">ecstatically	and	settled	down	on	her	rug	to	start	masticating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 wasn’t	 until	 later,	 when	 I’d	 put	 away	 the	 Ruger	 I	 hadn’t	 needed	 and similarly	 stowed	 the	 shotgun,	 then	 sat	 down	 to	 catch	 my	 breath,	 that	 I	 stared down	at	the	heavy	gold	bracelet	on	my	wrist.	How	much	was	it	worth? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wrong	question,	in	this	time	when	a	pound	of	beef	was	probably	worth	a	lot</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a>more	than	a	pound	of	gold.	The	more	accurate	question	to	ask	would	be,  <i class="calibre3">What</i> <i class="calibre3">did	this	cost? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	know.	I’d	had	a	small	collection	of	costume	jewelry	and	a	few	pieces</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	Native	American	work,	mostly	turquoise.	When	I	packed	my	belongings	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">left	Albuquerque,	I	hadn’t	brought	any	of	it	along,	save	the	small	silver	hoops	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	already	wearing.	Just	hadn’t	seen	the	point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	this	thing,	which	should	have	been	adorning	the	wrist	of	some	movie	star</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 red	 carpet?	 Who	 knows.	 Probably	 as	 much	 as	 the	 Grand	 Cherokee	 had cost	my	father	when	he	bought	it	brand	new. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 twisted	 the	 bracelet	 around	 and	 around,	 and	 then	 became	 aware	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	 sharp	 sticking	 into	 my	 left	 hip	 bone.	 Puzzled,	 I	 reached	 into	 the pocket	of	my	jeans,	thinking	that	maybe	I’d	stuck	something	in	there	earlier	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgotten	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 fingers	 closed	 around	 two	 cool,	 heavy	 objects.	 I	 drew	 them	 out,	 then opened	my	hand	to	see	what	the	hell	they	were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 a	 second	 or	 two,	 I	 just	 stared	 down	 at	 them.	 Then,	 because	 I	 couldn’t think	of	what	else	to	do,	I	began	to	laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 my	 hand	 were	 the	 tanzanite	 and	 diamond	 earrings	 Elena	 and	 Tori	 and	 I had	admired	on	our	last	trip	to	Santa	Fe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	bring	up	the	subject	of	the	earrings.	How	could	I?	That	would	mean	I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	to	ask	how	the	voice	knew	I’d	seen	those	earrings	and	fallen	partly	in	love</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 them,	 even	 though	 I’d	 known	 I	 would	 never	 in	 a	 million	 years	 be	 able	 to afford	something	like	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No,	 I’d	 stowed	 them	 in	 the	 drawer	 of	 my	 nightstand	 and	 tried	 to	 put	 the incident	 out	 of	 my	 mind.	 And	 since	 in	 the	 days	 that	 followed,	 I	 didn’t	 need	 to leave	the	compound,	I	didn’t	hear	from	the	voice	much.	If	I	was	trying	to	find	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">certain	item,	like	a	screwdriver,	I’d	ask	where	it	might	be	located,	and	the	voice would	 always	 answer.	 Otherwise,	 though,	 it	 seemed	 to	 be	 leaving	 me	 alone again,	allowing	me	to	find	some	equilibrium	in	my	new	life	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was,	surprisingly,	enough	to	keep	me	busy.	As	I’d	promised	my	father, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 wrote	 down	 as	 much	 as	 I	 could	 about	 the	 way	 the	 Heat	 had	 come	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Albuquerque,	and	what	the	city	had	looked	like	when	I	left.	That	was	a	spare	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>painful	narrative,	though,	and	so	I	also	wrote	down	random	memories,	just	so	I wouldn’t	forget	them	—	the	surprise	party	my	father	had	thrown	my	mother	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	fiftieth	birthday.	Devin’s	touchdown	at	the	homecoming	game	last	year.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">crazy	artist	who’d	approached	me	on	one	of	our	girls’	Santa	Fe	trips	and	told	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	an	amazing	face	and	that	he	wanted	to	paint	me.	Things	like	that…bright</p>
<p class="calibre1">pieces	of	a	world	now	gone	forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 addition	 to	 all	 that,	 I	 tended	 the	 plants	 in	 the	 greenhouse	 and	 puttered around	the	house	and	took	Dutchie	for	long	walks,	which	also	helped	me	inspect</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	perimeter	of	the	property.	The	wall	was	in	perfect	condition,	as	far	as	I	could tell,	and	a	good	barrier	against	wild	animals,	of	which	there	were	plenty	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">area.	I	could	hear	the	coyotes	calling	at	night	sometimes,	and	one	time	the	snarl</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 a	 cougar	 or	 bobcat.	 Needless	 to	 say,	 I	 hadn’t	 ventured	 out	 to	 investigate, although	 Dutchie	 had	 gone	 nuts,	 growling	 and	 barking	 as	 she	 moved	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1">window	to	window,	presumably	following	along	as	the	wild	cat	moved	along	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wall	that	bordered	the	property. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 none	 of	 those	 animals	 had	 gotten	 close	 enough	 to	 trigger	 the	 security system,	which	was	why	I	almost	had	a	heart	attack	one	afternoon,	about	ten	days</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	I’d	come	to	Santa	Fe,	when	all	of	a	sudden	the	house	was	filled	with	a	shrill alarm.	I’d	been	sitting	in	the	breakfast	nook	in	the	kitchen,	keeping	one	eye	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	book	I	was	reading	and	another	on	the	loaf	of	bread	I	had	in	the	oven.	Bread-</p>
<p class="calibre1">making	was	a	new	venture	for	me,	but	really,	what	else	did	I	have	to	do	with	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">time? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shot	a	quick	glance	at	the	timer	and	saw	the	loaf	still	had	around	a	half	hour</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	go,	then	bolted	from	the	kitchen	so	I	could	bring	up	the	security	feed	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">computer	in	the	office.	After	I	jiggled	the	mouse	to	wake	up	the	iMac,	I	saw	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">grid	with	its	images	from	all	nine	security	cameras,	including	the	one	at	the	front gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	 was	 standing	 there,	 staring	 up	 at	 the	 house.	 From	 the	 way	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mouth	was	moving,	it	sounded	as	if	he	was	calling	out,	but	the	security	system</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t	have	audio,	only	video.	And	because	it	was	a	chilly	day,	threatening	rain</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	like	the	time	I’d	had	my	meltdown	in	the	plaza,	all	the	windows	were	shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Should	I	ignore	him?	Wait	it	out	and	hope	he	would	go	away?	If	he’d	meant</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 sneak	 in	 and	 wreak	 havoc,	 he	 probably	 wouldn’t	 have	 been	 shouting	 for attention	at	the	front	gate.	Still…. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	the	first	living	soul	I’d	seen	in	two	weeks.	The	camera	didn’t	show</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	huge	amount	of	detail,	because	the	sun	was	at	his	back	and	all	I	could	see	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	silhouette,	but	I	hadn’t	seen	any	evidence	of	a	gun	or	any	other	weapon.	Not</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	that	meant	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deciding	 to	 compromise,	 I	 got	 the	 shotgun	 out	 of	 the	 gun	 safe	 and	 then</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a>headed	out	the	front	door,	Dutchie	tagging	along	at	my	heels.	She	hadn’t	barked yet,	 but	 maybe	 that	 was	 only	 because	 she	 hadn’t	 yet	 caught	 a	 whiff	 of	 the stranger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 walked	 down	 the	 driveway	 and	 paused	 about	 six	 feet	 from	 the	 gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because	 the	 drive	 sloped	 up	 the	 hill	 toward	 the	 house	 and	 the	 garage,	 I	 had something	of	a	vantage	point,	could	see	that	this	unwelcome	visitor	was	a	young</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	probably	around	my	age	or	maybe	a	few	years	older.	Black	hair	pulled	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	a	ponytail,	warm	brown	skin,	black	almond-shaped	eyes.	Definitely	Native</p>
<p class="calibre1">American. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And…gorgeous.	Like,	the	kind	of	gorgeous	I	would’ve	had	a	hard	time	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">staring	 at	 if	 I’d	 been	 in	 a	 club	 or	 out	 with	 my	 friends	 at	 a	 restaurant	 or	 the movies	 or	 the	 mall.	 Having	 someone	 who	 looked	 like	 that	 turn	 up	 on	 my doorstep,	when	I	hadn’t	seen	anyone	since	the	man	I’d	shot	outside	Walgreens? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	let’s	just	say	it	was	a	little	overwhelming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	not	so	much	I	forgot	that	I	was	here	alone,	sitting	on	top	of	a	stockpile	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">supplies	that	were	a	damn	good	incentive	for	murder,	as	far	as	I	was	concerned.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">hefted	the	shotgun	so	he	could	see	it,	but	didn’t	bring	it	up	to	eye	level. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	are	you?”	I	demanded,	while	Dutchie	sat	beside	me,	wagging	her	tail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	much	for	looking	intimidating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jason	 Little	 River,”	 he	 said,	 eyeing	 the	 shotgun	 but	 clearly	 attempting	 to keep	a	pleasant	expression	on	his	face.	“My	friends	call	me	Jace.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	 Jason,”	 I	 said,	 emphasizing	 his	 full	 name,	 “how	 did	 you	 find	 this place?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	paused,	clearly	a	little	disconcerted	by	the	hostility	in	my	tone.	“The	tire</p>
<p class="calibre1">tracks,”	he	replied,	pointing	at	the	rutted	road	that	led	to	the	compound.	Since	it had	 started	 raining	 on	 the	 way	 back	 from	 my	 last	 trip	 into	 town,	 the	 tracks	 I’d left	were	fairly	defined.	Damn.	I	hadn’t	even	thought	of	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	those	obvious	tire	tracks	didn’t	explain	everything.	“You	still	had	to	get	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	way	out	of	town	to	even	see	where	this	road	started.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“True.	I	had	a	friend	who	lived	on	Upper	Canyon.	I	came	here	to	Santa	Fe	—</p>
<p class="calibre1">well,	I	came	here	hoping	he	might	still	be	okay.	Stupid,	I	know.”	Jason	paused, </p>
<p class="calibre1">gaze	lingering	on	the	shotgun	before	returning	to	my	face.	“And	when	I	went	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 house….”	 Under	 the	 heavy	 backpack	 he	 wore,	 the	 kind	 of	 metal-framed thing	 serious	 hikers	 used,	 his	 shoulders	 lifted.	 “No	 one	 there,	 of	 course.	 I	 was sort	of	walking	around,	trying	to	figure	out	what	to	do	next,	and	I	saw	the	tracks on	the	road	going	up	the	hill	past	his	property.	I	figured	I	might	as	well	check	it out.	The	tracks	seemed	too	fresh	to	have	been	made	before…well,	before.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	bother	to	ask	him	what	he	meant	by	“before.”	For	all	of	us	survivors, </p>
<p class="calibre1">our	lives	would	forever	be	divided	between	“before”	and	“after.”	“You	say	you</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>came	here	to	Santa	Fe.	Where	from?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Taos.	I	lived	on	the	pueblo	there.”	A	disarming	grin,	one	that	under	different</p>
<p class="calibre1">circumstances	might	have	made	my	knees	melt.	“Well,	part-time.	I	also	had	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">apartment	in	town.	You?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 on	 my	 lips	 to	 say	 I	 was	 the	 one	 asking	 the	 questions	 here,	 but	 that sounded	awfully	rude,	even	under	the	current	circumstances.	“Albuquerque.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyebrows	went	up.	“How’d	you	manage	to	get	here,	of	all	places?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hefted	the	shotgun.	“I	don’t	think	that	matters.	I’m	here	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 didn’t	 miss	 the	 way	 I’d	 shifted	 the	 gun,	 just	 enough	 to	 show	 I	 wasn’t thrilled	 by	 his	 questions.	 “Hey,	 it’s	 okay.	 It’s	 just	 —	 I	 haven’t	 seen	 anyone	 for almost	two	weeks.	I’m	probably	a	little	off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">You	 and	 me	 both,	 honey. </i> Relenting	 a	 little,	 I	 asked,	 “So	 no	 one	 was	 left	 in Taos?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	shadow	seemed	to	pass	over	his	face,	but	his	voice	was	level	as	he	replied, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	one	in	the	pueblo.	When	I	went	into	town,	I	didn’t	see	anyone,	except	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman	 lurking	 around	 one	 of	 the	 hotels.	 She	 took	 one	 look	 at	 me	 and	 ran	 off screaming.”	He	shrugged.	“Since	I	could	tell	she	wasn’t	open	to	conversation,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t	bother	to	go	after	her.	She	could	have	been	armed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you	weren’t?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again	 I	 saw	 his	 eyes	 flicker	 toward	 the	 gun	 I	 held.	 “No.	 Well,	 not	 besides this.”	His	hand	went	to	his	hip,	where	I	could	see	he	wore	some	kind	of	leather</p>
<p class="calibre1">scabbard,	about	the	size	to	conceal	a	hunting	knife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	me	see	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	 this	 distance,	 I	 couldn’t	 really	 hear	 him	 sigh,	 but	 I	 could	 tell	 his patience	was	starting	to	run	thin.	Holding	my	gaze,	he	undid	the	snap	that	kept</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 knife	 in	 place,	 then	 pulled	 it	 out	 of	 its	 sheath.	 As	 I’d	 thought,	 it	 was	 a	 big piece	 clearly	 designed	 for	 hunting,	 with	 a	 serrated	 edge.	 My	 father	 had	 owned one	not	unlike	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	that’s	all?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	nodded,	then	went	on,	“Hey,	I	have	a	peace	offering.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	Saying	my	tone	was	guarded	would	have	been	an	understatement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	going	to	get	something	out	of	my	backpack,”	he	said,	laying	the	knife</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	in	the	dirt	in	front	of	him.	“Okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Depends	what	it	is,”	I	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	grin,	one	that	showed	off	a	dazzling	set	of	white	teeth.	I	had	a	feeling	he’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">used	that	smile	to	good	effect	a	number	of	times	in	the	past,	but	I	had	to	make	it seem	 as	 if	 it	 wasn’t	 affecting	 me,	 even	 though	 I	 could	 feel	 a	 not-unpleasant shiver	go	through	me	at	the	way	the	smile	lit	up	his	dark	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	you’ll	like	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>He	 unslung	 the	 backpack,	 setting	 it	 on	 the	 ground	 before	 unzipping	 it	 and spending	 a	 few	 seconds	 going	 through	 its	 contents.	 His	 back	 was	 to	 me,	 so	 I couldn’t	 see	 exactly	 what	 he	 was	 doing.	 Almost	 at	 once,	 though,	 he	 turned around.	In	each	hand	he	held	a	wine	bottle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very	nice,	but	I’ve	got	a	pretty	stocked	cellar	up	there,”	I	said,	jerking	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">chin	back	toward	the	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	 but	 this	 is	 La	 Chiripada	 cabernet	 sauvignon.	 New	 Mexico	 wine.	 You</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	any	of	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	really	didn’t	have	any	idea.	Besides	the	wine	refrigerator	in	the	kitchen,	I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">discovered	 another	 trove	 in	 the	 basement,	 cases	 and	 cases	 of	 wine,	 most	 of	 it from	 California	 and	 France,	 from	 what	 I	 could	 tell,	 and	 some	 odd	 bits	 from South	 America	 and	 Arizona.	 I	 hadn’t	 noticed	 anything	 from	 New	 Mexico,	 but then	again,	I	hadn’t	exactly	been	looking	for	it,	either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	hesitated,	not	sure	how	to	respond,	I	heard	the	voice	in	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">He	is	safe. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	 I	 murmured	 under	 my	 breath,	 hoping	 the	 stranger	 wouldn’t	 notice</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	muttering	to	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">He	is	safe.	There	is	no	reason	to	keep	him	out. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait…you	actually	 <i class="calibre3">want</i>	me	to	let	him	in?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Yes. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">To	 say	 I	 was	 flummoxed	 would	 be	 an	 understatement.	 Here	 it	 seemed	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice	 had	 done	 everything	 to	 keep	 me	 safe,	 to	 have	 me	 avoid	 other	 survivors because	of	the	dangers	involved,	and	now	he	wanted	me	to	allow	a	strange	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	simply	walk	into	my	sanctuary	here? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	happens	if	he	 <i class="calibre3">isn’t</i>	safe?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">He	is	safe.	I	promise	you. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	 with	 the	 voice	 stating	 his	 opinion	 so	 flatly,	 I	 couldn’t	 help	 hesitating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">True,	he	had	always	protected	me,	argued	with	me	when	I	wanted	to	do	things	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">found	too	dangerous.	So	I	supposed	I	should	be	trusting	his	judgment	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 sent	 a	 sidelong	 glance	 in	 the	 stranger’s	 direction.	 He	 was	 still	 standing there,	a	bottle	in	each	hand,	a	half	hopeful,	half	anxious	expression	on	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	something	so	goofy	about	the	combination,	so	oddly	adorable,	that	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">found	myself	relenting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	 right,”	 I	 muttered	 to	 the	 voice.	 “You’d	 just	 better	 not	 be	 playing supernatural	matchmaker	here	or	something,	or	we’ll	be	discussing	this	further.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	answer	to	that.	I	hadn’t	really	expected	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	quite	allowing	myself	to	sigh,	I	transferred	the	shotgun	to	my	left	hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 began	 walking	 to	 the	 gate.	 There	 was	 a	 manual	 release	 there,	 since obviously	I	hadn’t	brought	the	remote	with	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>“Okay,”	I	told	Jason.	“I’ve	never	had	La	Chiripada.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 look	 of	 relief	 that	 passed	 over	 his	 face	 was	 also	 adorable,	 and	 erased some	 of	 the	 strain	 I’d	 seen	 in	 his	 features.	 “Great.	 Thanks.	 I	 appreciate	 this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Really.”	He	began	stuffing	the	wine	bottles	into	his	backpack,	then	hefted	it	onto his	shoulders.	After	that,	he	shot	me	a	questioning	look.	“And	your	name	is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jessica,”	 I	 told	 him	 as	 I	 pushed	 the	 button	 to	 open	 the	 gate.	 “Jessica Monroe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	 one	 of	 those	 blazing	 smiles.	 “Well,	 Jessica,	 I	 am	  <i class="calibre3">very</i>	 pleased	 to make	your	acquaintance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a><img src="index-120_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="index-120_2.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">ELEVEN</p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 headed	 up	 to	 the	 house	 after	 that,	 Dutchie	 dancing	 around	 Jason,	 tail wagging	and	tongue	lolling	as	if	her	long-lost	best	friend	had	just	come	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hope	you’re	a	dog	person,”	I	told	him	as	we	went	in	the	front	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am,	actually.	There	were	always	a	lot	of	dogs	on	the	pueblo.	I	didn’t	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	of	my	own,	since	I	was	living	in	an	apartment	about	half	the	time,	but	—	” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 broke	 off,	 pausing	 a	 few	 paces	 inside	 the	 entryway.	 His	 expression	 was	 so awestruck	 that	 at	 first	 I	 thought	 he	 was	 impressed	 by	 the	 house,	 which	 didn’t surprise	 me	 too	 much.	 It	 was	 pretty	 impressive.	 But	 then	 he	 said,	 “Is	 that <i class="calibre3">bread? </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is,”	I	said,	adding,	“and	I	hope	I	haven’t	just	burned	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	jogged	into	the	kitchen,	Dutchie	tagging	along	at	my	heels,	since	of	course</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	kitchen	was	her	favorite	room	in	the	house.	Jason	followed	at	a	more	sedate</p>
<p class="calibre1">pace,	probably	because	of	the	backpack	he	carried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	when	I	peered	into	the	oven,	the	bread	looked	perfect,	golden	brown	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	just	the	right	amount	of	loft.	The	timer	said	I	had	exactly	thirty	seconds	to go.	So	I	grabbed	some	potholders	and	pulled	out	the	pan,	setting	it	on	the	stove</p>
<p class="calibre1">top	to	cool. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	then	Jason	had	shrugged	off	his	backpack	and	leaned	it	up	against	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	cupboards.	“That’s	amazing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is?”	I	asked,	turning	to	face	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a>“The	 bread.	 This.”	 He	 waved	 a	 hand,	 as	 if	 indicating	 the	 kitchen	 and	 the house	beyond.	“It’s	like	—	it’s	like	it	never	happened.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again,	I	didn’t	have	to	ask	what	he	meant	by	“it.”	“Someone	definitely	put	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lot	of	work	into	this	house.	I	was	lucky	to	find	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 pause,	 during	 which	 I	 wondered	 if	 he	 was	 going	 to	 ask	 again	 how	 I	 had found	it…and	what	the	hell	I	should	say	in	response	to	such	a	question.	Instead, </p>
<p class="calibre1">though,	he	inquired,	“Your	family	didn’t	build	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	no.	We	could	never	have	afforded	something	like	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 reply	 appeared	 to	 make	 him	 relax	 slightly.	 Maybe	 he’d	 been	 thinking	 I was	some	rich	girl	from	the	city	or	something.	There	was	a	joke.	But	I	could	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">how	that	might	have	made	things	even	more	awkward	between	us;	I	knew	most</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	my	state’s	Native	American	residents	weren’t	exactly	rolling	in	cash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	 neither	 was	 my	 family,	 so	 I	 added,	 “I	 found	 some	 paperwork	 when	 I was	 going	 through	 the	 house.	 The	 guy	 who	 built	 it	 was	 a	 real	 estate	 developer from	Phoenix.	I	doubt	he’s	going	to	be	showing	up	any	time	soon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	nod,	although	I	could	see	the	way	Jason	was	surveying	the	kitchen,	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 gleaming	 stainless-steel	 appliances	 to	 the	 custom	 cupboards	 and	 granite countertops.	I	had	no	idea	what	he	might	be	thinking.	In	that	moment,	I	was	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">strangely	glad	that	I’d	been	so	careful	about	keeping	the	place	clean.	In	the	past, I	 hadn’t	 been	 what	 you	 might	 call	 the	 world’s	 greatest	 housekeeper,	 but	 now	 I found	cleaning	the	house	helped	to	distract	me,	and	used	up	some	of	the	empty</p>
<p class="calibre1">hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 next	 question	 surprised	 me.	 “You	 came	 from	 Albuquerque.	 We	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">pretty	 cut	 off	 in	 Taos.	 Did	 you	 ever	 hear	 anything	 more	 about	 the	 disease…</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	it	started,	mortality	rates,	anything	like	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	the	last	thing	I	wanted	to	talk	about,	but	Jace	clearly	wanted	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">information	than	he’d	gotten	back	home.	Not	that	I	had	a	lot	to	give	him.	Even</p>
<p class="calibre1">so,	I	thought	it	best	to	stall	a	little	while	I	figured	out	how	much	I	should	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Water?”	 I	 asked,	 and	 he	 blinked,	 clearly	 startled	 by	 the	 non	 sequitur,	 then replied, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	thanks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 I	 got	 a	 glass	 from	 the	 cupboard	 and	 filled	 it	 up	 with	 water	 from	 the refrigerator	door.	When	I	went	to	hand	it	to	him,	I	realized	how	tall	he	was,	how</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	 were	 definitely	 some	 impressive	 muscles	 under	 the	 loose-fitting	 flannel shirt	he	wore.	And	even	though	he	had	to	have	been	living	rough	for	the	past	few</p>
<p class="calibre1">weeks,	 I	 could	 tell	 he	 was	 clean.	 In	 fact,	 I	 caught	 the	 faintest	 scent	 of	 wood smoke	 coming	 from	 his	 clothes,	 and	 something	 about	 the	 aroma	 made	 a	 little thrill	go	through	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	definitely	needed	to	get	it	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>Stepping	away	from	him,	pretending	that	I	needed	to	go	check	on	the	bread,	I said,	 “Things	 fell	 apart	 pretty	 quickly	 in	 Albuquerque,	 too.	 We	 never	 got	 a straight	story	about	where	it	started	or	anything	like	that.	Afterward….”	I	let	the words	 trail	 off	 as	 I	 flashed	 back	 to	 that	 dark	 Walgreens,	 and	 the	 man	 I	 had confronted	 there.	 “I	 did	 meet	 someone	 who	 said	 he’d	 worked	 for	 emergency management	downtown.	He	said	the	mortality	rate	was	99.8	percent.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shit.”	With	his	brown	skin,	Jace	couldn’t	exactly	go	pale,	but	I	still	saw	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">blood	appear	to	drain	from	his	face.	Then	his	dark	eyes	seemed	to	go	sharp	as	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">focused	on	what	I’d	just	said.	“Wait	—	you	 <i class="calibre3">met</i>	another	survivor?	Where	is	he?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Shit</i>	was	right.	I’d	just	met	Jace.	Was	I	supposed	to	tell	him	that	I’d	murdered a	man? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	see	much	of	a	way	around	it.	If	we	were	really	going	to	be	sharing</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	house,	I	wasn’t	sure	I	wanted	to	keep	that	big	a	secret	from	him.	He	needed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	know,	so	he	could	decide	if	it	was	worth	the	risk	to	stay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	dead,”	I	said,	my	voice	flat,	harsh.	“He	tried	to	take	my	vehicle	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	me,	all	the	supplies	I’d	put	together.	He	pulled	a	gun	on	me.	So	I	shot	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence.	 Jace	 stared	 at	 me,	 obviously	 trying	 to	 process	 what	 I’d	 just	 said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 he	 spoke,	 his	 tone	 was	 a	 lot	 gentler	 than	 I’d	 expected.	 “Because	 he	 was trying	to	steal	from	you,	and	you	would’ve	been	dead	without	that	vehicle	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">those	supplies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 question	 was,  <i class="calibre3">would</i>	 I	 have	 been?	 I	 could	 have	 gone	 foraging	 all	 over again	if	necessary,	could’ve	found	one	of	the	abandoned	vehicles	and	hot-wired</p>
<p class="calibre1">it,	 another	 skill	 my	 father	 had	 taught	 me.	 I	 wasn’t	 sure	 what	 happened	 to	 car keys	 if	 they	 were	 actually	 on	 a	 victim	 of	 the	 Heat,	 in	 a	 pocket	 or	 something, when	 they	 went	 to	 dust.	 All	 their	 clothes	 and	 jewelry	 seemed	 to	 disappear,	 so obviously	the	heat	in	their	bodies	was	so	extreme	that	it	could	destroy	everything around	 them.	 Or	 was	 the	 explanation	 that	 simple?	 I	 hadn’t	 actually	 stopped	 to puzzle	 it	 out,	 mostly	 because	 I	 knew	 in	 the	 end	 it	 didn’t	 really	 matter.	 Those people	were	gone,	and	so	were	the	belongings	they	had	on	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 thought	 so	 at	 the	 time,”	 I	 said	 slowly.	 As	 Jason	 kept	 looking	 at	 me	 with that	 concerned	 expression	 on	 his	 face,	 I	 felt	 something	 give	 way	 inside,	 the words	flowing	out,	even	though	I	hadn’t	meant	to	mention	anything	else	of	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	happened.	“And	he	had	this	 <i class="calibre3">look</i>	on	his	face,	and	the	night	before	that,	crazy Chris	Bowman	had	broken	into	my	house	and	 <i class="calibre3">attacked</i>	me,	and	—	” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 couldn’t	 go	 on,	 because	 out	 of	 nowhere	 tears	 were	 streaming	 down	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">face,	and,	to	my	dismay,	I’d	begun	to	sob,	the	horror	of	it	all	coming	back	to	me, something	dark	and	terrible	that	had	only	been	lurking	in	the	murky	sediment	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	bottom	of	my	mind,	just	waiting	to	return	and	overwhelm	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jason	crossed	the	kitchen	and	pulled	me	against	him,	his	hand	smoothing	my</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a>hair,	his	warm	voice	murmuring	my	name	as	I	wept	into	his	shirt,	the	flannel	soft against	my	cheek.	He	smelled	of	wood	smoke	and	pine	needles,	and	underneath</p>
<p class="calibre1">that,	clean	male	sweat,	and	I	breathed	him	in,	reassured	beyond	measure	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">feel	of	someone	so	solid,	so	real. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then	 I	 realized	 what	 I	 was	 doing,	 that	 I	 was	 sobbing	 in	 the	 arms	 of	 a man	 I	 had	 just	 met,	 and	 I	 pushed	 myself	 away,	 shaking	 my	 head.	 “I	 —	 I’m sorry,”	I	gasped.	“That	was	just	—	that	came	out	of	nowhere.	I’m	sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 okay,”	 he	 said.	 His	 dark	 eyes	 seemed	 alight	 with	 compassion,	 with understanding.	“I	can’t	imagine	how	rough	this	must	have	been	for	you.	And	I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">sorry	 that	 you…did	 what	 you	 had	 to	 do.	 But	 I	 don’t	 think	 you	 can	 blame yourself	for	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	to	the	paper	towel	dispenser	and	tore	off	a	partial	sheet,	then	blotted</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	eyes.	Good	thing	I	hadn’t	bothered	with	makeup	since	I’d	gotten	here,	except</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 some	 gloss	 to	 keep	 my	 lips	 from	 cracking	 in	 the	 dry,	 cold	 weather.	 “Thank you,”	 I	 said	 simply.	 “But	 I	 do	 blame	 myself.	 There	 had	 to	 be	 something	 else	 I could	have	done	—	” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	about	that,”	he	said.	“Sounds	like	you	were	kind	of	up	against</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	wall.”	Again	I	was	struck	by	the	warmth	in	his	expression…but	it	wasn’t	 <i class="calibre3">that</i> kind	 of	 warmth,	 more	 that	 he	 was	 sorry	 I’d	 had	 to	 go	 through	 anything	 so terrible.	“But	I’m	glad	you	told	me	the	truth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	was	I,	oddly	enough.	I’d	just	told	him	the	worst	thing	about	me,	and	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">hadn’t	even	blinked.	That	had	to	be	a	good	sign. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 glad,	 too,”	 I	 told	 him,	 wanting	 to	 put	 the	 whole	 thing	 behind	 me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow	 I	 knew	 Jace	 wouldn’t	 press	 the	 issue	 any	 further.	 “Now,	 how	 about some	of	this	bread?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">And	like	that,	Jason	Little	River	came	to	live	at	the	compound.	He	took	over	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">larger	 of	 the	 secondary	 bedrooms,	 putting	 his	 meager	 belongings	 in	 the	 closet there.	 I	 noticed	 that	 he	 hadn’t	 brought	 any	 personal	 items	 with	 him,	 no photographs	 of	 family	 or	 anything	 like	 that,	 unlike	 the	 wedding	 photo	 of	 my parents	that	now	lived	on	the	mantel	in	the	living	room,	or	the	shot	of	all	of	us	at one	 of	 Devin’s	 football	 games,	 which	 was	 now	 sitting	 on	 the	 dresser	 in	 the master	bedroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>When	I	asked	him	about	his	family,	his	expression	grew	shuttered.	“All	gone now,”	 he	 said,	 and	 didn’t	 seem	 to	 want	 to	 talk	 about	 it	 anymore.	 Since	 I understood	 all	 too	 well	 what	 it	 felt	 like	 to	 lose	 everyone	 around	 you,	 I	 didn’t press	 the	 issue.	 Although	 I	 didn’t	 know	 a	 whole	 lot	 about	 life	 on	 the	 pueblo,	 I knew	it	had	to	be	a	fairly	close-knit	community,	a	sort	of	huge	extended	family</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	 unlike	 what	 I’d	 grown	 up	 with.	 His	 loss	 was	 probably	 even	 more	 painful than	 mine.	 If	 he	 wanted	 to	 open	 up	 about	 it	 later,	 after	 he’d	 had	 time	 to	 work through	it	in	his	own	way,	then	I	would	be	there	to	listen	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	impressed	by	the	compound,	by	all	the	lengths	its	builder	had	gone</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	so	it	would	be	self-sustaining.	Even	so,	after	one	morning	of	walking	around</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	inspecting	everything,	just	a	day	or	two	after	he	moved	in,	he	told	me,	“We</p>
<p class="calibre1">should	 really	 be	 thinking	 about	 getting	 some	 livestock.	 This	 place	 isn’t	 big enough	for	cattle,	but	maybe	some	goats?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Goats?”	 I	 repeated,	 not	 bothering	 to	 keep	 the	 skepticism	 out	 of	 my	 voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	not	suggesting	we	 <i class="calibre3">eat</i>	a	goat,	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 teeth	 flashed	 in	 the	 morning	 sun	 as	 he	 grinned	 at	 me.	 It	 was	 a	 bright, brisk	 day,	 the	 sky	 dappled	 with	 clouds,	 but	 the	 sunlight	 still	 fiercely	 bright. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	the	glaring	sun,	I	could	feel	the	bite	in	the	wind,	the	unmistakable	signs that	winter	was	coming…and	that	it	was	going	to	be	a	lot	colder	than	anything</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	experienced	down	in	Albuquerque. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	original	 <i class="calibre3">barbacoa</i>	 was	 made	 with	 goat,”	 he	 pointed	 out.	 I	 only	 raised an	eyebrow,	and	he	laughed	and	went	on,	“I	was	thinking	more	in	terms	of	milk</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	cheese.	The	cheese	you	have	now	isn’t	going	to	last	forever.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	 that	 was	 true.	 We	 had	 plenty	 of	 other	 staples,	 but	 some	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">perishables	like	the	cheese	and	the	butter	were	about	on	their	last	legs.	“Do	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">know	how	to	milk	a	goat?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	but	I’ve	milked	cows.	The	technique	can’t	be	all	that	different.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 way	 he	 said	 it,	 halfway	 arch,	 halfway	 teasing,	 just	 made	 me	 shake	 my head.	 “Okay,	 I’ll	 let	 you	 do	 it.	 Assuming	 we	 can	 even	 find	 any	 goats.	 They weren’t	exactly	thick	on	the	ground,	the	last	time	I	checked.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	 not,	 but	 there	 were	 probably	 people	 on	 the	 outskirts	 of	 town	 who kept	livestock,	and	I	know	I	saw	animal	pens	up	in	Nambe	as	I	came	down	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">town.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh?”	 I	 asked.	 It	 was	 the	 first	 time	 he’d	 made	 any	 mention	 of	 his	 journey here.	 I	 hadn’t	 pressed,	 because	 I	 knew	 better	 than	 anyone	 else	 that	 there	 were some	things	people	just	didn’t	want	to	talk	about.	Even	so,	I’d	wondered	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	long	walk	from	Taos,	and	what	he’d	encountered	on	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.”	He	wasn’t	looking	at	me,	was	instead	staring	to	the	north	and	east, </p>
<p class="calibre1">presumably	 in	 the	 direction	 from	 which	 he’d	 come.	 “Part	 of	 the	 reason	 it	 took</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>me	so	long	to	get	here	was	that	I	took	the	High	Road	down	from	Taos.	I	figured it	might	be	safer	to	stay	off	the	main	roads.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 you	 walked	 that	 whole	 way?”	 I	 asked,	 staring	 at	 him	 with	 some</p>
<p class="calibre1">incredulity.	I’d	heard	of	the	High	Road,	but	I’d	never	been	on	it.	The	scenic	side trip	 was	 one	 that	 my	 family	 had	 discussed	 taking	 a	 few	 times,	 but	 those	 plans had	never	materialized.	My	father	had	always	been	a	Point	A	to	Point	B	kind	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">guy	and	was	more	intent	on	the	destination	than	on	the	road	that	led	to	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace	gave	me	a	rueful	smile.	“Not	at	first.	I	had	a	motorcycle,	and	I’d	ridden</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	before	with	my	backpack,	although	I	know	that’s	not	really	recommended.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 thought	 I	 could	 do	 it	 if	 I	 kept	 my	 speed	 down.	 Besides,	 a	 motorcycle	 is	 a	 lot easier	to	maneuver	around	abandoned	vehicles.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	couldn’t	argue	with	that.	But	a	motorcycle	wouldn’t	have	worked	for	me.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 too	 much	 stuff	 to	 bring,	 and	 besides,	 there	 was	 Dutchie.	 Well,	 maybe	 a sidecar…. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning	away	from	me,	Jason	surveyed	the	horizon	again.	The	wind	picked</p>
<p class="calibre1">up,	 pulling	 strands	 of	 heavy	 dark	 hair	 out	 of	 the	 piece	 of	 thin	 leather	 he	 had wrapped	 around	 his	 ponytail.	 His	 hair	 hung	 a	 few	 inches	 below	 his	 shoulders, and	 so	 far	 I	 hadn’t	 seen	 it	 in	 anything	 but	 that	 heavy	 tail	 down	 his	 back.	 That hadn’t	stopped	me	from	wondering	what	it	would	look	like,	sleek	and	loose	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">those	broad	shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Which	 was	 exactly	 the	 wrong	 thing	 to	 be	 thinking.	 After	 I’d	 lost	 it	 the	 day we’d	 met,	 and	 he’d	 held	 me	 and	 comforted	 me,	 we’d	 maintained	 a	 careful distance	between	us.	I	hadn’t	noted	even	a	flicker	of	interest	from	him.	Maybe	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t	his	type,	or	maybe	it	was	the	far	more	stark	fact	that	he’d	lost	not	just	his family,	 but	 his	 people,	 his	 entire	 way	 of	 life.	 He	 seemed	 to	 be	 bouncing	 back fairly	 well,	 but	 it	 was	 probably	 a	 little	 self-absorbed	 of	 me	 to	 think	 he’d	 be interested	in	any	sort	of	romantic	entanglements	so	soon	after	suffering	that	kind of	shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides,	 I	 wasn’t	 even	 sure	 whether	  <i class="calibre3">I</i>	 was	 interested	 in	 anything	 like	 that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes,	Jace	was	extremely	good-looking,	and	he	had	an	easygoing	way	about	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 I	 appreciated,	 after	 some	 of	 the	 high-strung	 guys	 I’d	 dated	 in	 the	 past,	 but our	 focus	 should	 be	 on	 survival	 first	 and	 foremost.	 Those	 other	 sorts	 of complications	were	pretty	far	down	my	list	of	priorities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	anyway,	break-ups	were	bad	enough	when	you	had	a	decent	chance	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">never	 seeing	 the	 other	 person	 again.	 I	 didn’t	 exactly	 have	 that	 luxury	 at	 the moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace	didn’t	seem	to	have	noticed	my	preoccupation,	since	he	appeared	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">absorbed	in	studying	the	far-off	outlines	of	the	Jemez	mountain	range.	I	noticed</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	he	held	something	in	his	hand,	a	leather	thong	knotted	through	a	hole	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>smooth-polished	 black	 stone.	 His	 thumb	 moved	 over	 it,	 the	 motion	 reminding me	of	the	worry	beads	sometimes	used	by	Greek	men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	said,	“But	I	picked	up	something	in	my	tire	in	Placita.	I	had	a	patch</p>
<p class="calibre1">kit	in	my	backpack,	but	it	wasn’t	just	a	nail	that	had	blown	the	tire,	but	a	sharp rock.	I	lost	two	nights	there,	trying	to	fix	it,	scavenging	around	to	see	if	I	could find	anything	to	replace	it	with,	but	that	was	a	no-go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	 one	 there,	 either?”	 I	 asked,	 although	 I	 already	 knew	 what	 the	 answer would	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	 Not	 a	 soul.	 I	 did	 some	 foraging	 to	 replenish	 my	 supplies,	 which	 was what	 delayed	 me	 even	 more.	 Or	 maybe	 I	 just	 wasn’t	 looking	 forward	 to	 that long,	long	walk.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 would	 have	 been	 that.	 Even	 with	 the	 part	 of	 the	 trip	 he’d	 shaved	 off	 by riding	 his	 motorcycle,	 he	 still	 had	 to	 have	 walked	 a	 good	 forty	 miles	 or	 so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Farther,	actually,	because	it	was	still	about	fifteen	miles	from	Nambe	to	the	heart of	Santa	Fe,	and	then	another	five	miles	to	this	hidden	fold	of	the	hills	where	the compound	was	located. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you	did	it	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	nodded,	then	shoved	the	polished	stone	he’d	been	holding	back	into	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">pocket.	“There	was	nothing	left	in	Taos.	I	wandered	there	for	about	a	day	and	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">half	 —	 I	 was	 at	 the	 pueblo	 when	 the	 illness	 hit,	 and	 our	 healers	 couldn’t	 do anything	to	combat	it.	No	one	could.	People	were	being	told	to	stay	at	home,	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 local	 medical	 center	 didn’t	 have	 the	 resources	 to	 treat	 that	 many	 victims	 at once.	So…I	stayed	there	and	watched	everyone	die	around	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	waited	to	find	out	when	it	would	be	your	turn,”	I	said	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	 he	 shifted	 so	 his	 gaze	 fell	 upon	 me,	 rather	 than	 that	 far-off,	 jagged horizon.	 Those	 jet-black	 eyes,	 in	 their	 fringe	 of	 equally	 black	 lashes,	 were startled,	 but	 then	 he	 nodded	 in	 understanding.	 “Yes.	 That’s	 exactly	 what	 I	 did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	then	after	another	day	passed,	and	everyone	was	gone,	leaving	behind	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">dust,	I	realized	I	wouldn’t	be	lucky	enough	to	join	all	my	people	in	the	afterlife.	I was	doomed	to	drift	here,	in	a	world	I	hadn’t	chosen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 probably	 wouldn’t	 have	 phrased	 it	 that	 way,	 but	 he	 was	 right	 —	 that’s exactly	what	it	felt	like.	Being	cast	adrift	on	dark	waters,	paddling	desperately, although	you	had	no	idea	why	you’d	been	pushed	out	onto	that	black	ocean	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	first	place.	“So	you	left	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 nodded,	 and	 once	 again	 his	 attention	 moved	 back	 to	 the	 horizon,	 to	 the mountains	that	blocked	his	view	of	the	place	he	had	once	called	home.	“Well,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">went	from	the	pueblo	to	my	apartment.	At	least	I’d	had	the	motorcycle	with	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 the	 pueblo,	 so	 the	 trip	 didn’t	 take	 long.	 The	 whole	 way	 I	 didn’t	 see	 anyone, just	cars	left	along	the	side	of	the	road.	Same	thing	at	my	apartment	—	it	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>small	building,	only	four	units,	but	all	the	hotels	were	equally	deserted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	shoulders	lifted	under	the	leather	jacket	he	wore,	although	I	wasn’t	quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">sure	 of	 the	 reason	 for	 the	 shrug.	 Dismissing	 his	 futile	 attempts	 to	 find	 any survivors?	I	didn’t	know	him	well	enough	to	guess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyway,”	he	continued.	“I	could	tell	that	staying	in	Taos	probably	wasn’t	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	idea.	It’s	a	small	town…was,	I	mean…and	the	chances	of	finding	anyone</p>
<p class="calibre1">who’d	lived	through	the	Heat	were	pretty	low.	I	packed	what	I	could	and	left.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">did	see	that	one	woman	as	I	was	heading	out	of	town,	but,	as	I	said,	she	took	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 second	 she	 saw	 me.	 Maybe	 she	 thought	 I	 was	 a	 ghost.”	 He	 did	 smile	 then, but	grimly,	just	the	slightest	lift	at	the	corners	of	his	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Or	a	rapist, </i>	 I	 thought,	 recalling	 my	 own	 experiences.	 I	 didn’t	 say	 anything aloud,	though.	Whatever	he	might	be,	Jason	Little	River	was	clearly	 <i class="calibre3">not</i>	a	rapist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	the	wine?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	La	Chiripada	tasting	room	was	just	down	the	street	from	where	I	lived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	no	one	was	around,	I	figured	it	wouldn’t	matter	if	I	liberated	a	couple	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">bottles.	 I	 had	 a	 feeling	 I	 might	 need	 a	 drink	 in	 the	 near	 future.	 Or,”	 he	 added, with	a	real	smile	this	time,	his	expression	warming	as	he	looked	over	at	me,	“a</p>
<p class="calibre1">peace	offering.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 tried	 not	 to	 blush,	 but	 I	 wasn’t	 sure	 how	 successful	 I	 was	 at	 it.	 With	 any luck,	he’d	think	the	flush	in	my	cheeks	had	come	from	the	brisk	wind	blowing</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	from	the	north,	and	not	the	way	he’d	just	looked	at	me.	“Speaking	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wine,”	I	said,	my	tone	probably	too	casual,	“we	should	have	something	special</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	drink	it	with.	Frozen	tamales	probably	aren’t	festive	enough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	like	rabbit?”	Jace	asked,	a	gleam	in	those	black	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don’t	 know,”	 I	 replied	 uncertainly.	 I	 had	 a	 feeling	 I	 knew	 what	 he	 was going	to	suggest.	“I’ve	never	had	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	time	to	change	that.”	He	glanced	over	at	the	house,	then	back	at	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	is,	assuming	you	have	a	.22	in	that	gun	safe	of	yours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">At	least	he	didn’t	ask	me	to	go	with	him.	In	the	back	of	my	mind,	I’d	understood</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	at	some	point	I’d	have	to	start	eating	game	meats,	but	I	wasn’t	sure	I	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">handle	 watching	 Jace	 shoot	 a	 fluffy	 little	 bunny	 and	 then	 expect	 to	 roast	 it	 or whatever	a	few	hours	later. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>He	 did	 take	 Dutchie	 along,	 saying	 she	 might	 as	 well	 start	 to	 learn	 what	 it meant	 to	 be	 an	 outdoor	 dog.	 I	 knew	 he	 was	 right;	 her	 days	 as	 a	 pampered suburban	pooch	were	long	over.	Anyway,	she	was	more	than	happy	to	go	along</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 hunting	 expedition,	 trotting	 off	 at	 Jace’s	 side	 without	 even	 a	 backward glance	 toward	 the	 house.	 I	 only	 hoped	 she	 wouldn’t	 scare	 off	 every	 rabbit	 in	 a five-mile	radius. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	meantime,	I	had	to	scour	the	cookbooks	that	sat	on	the	shelf	mounted</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	kitchen	wall	to	see	if	I	could	find	anything	about	cooking	rabbit.	Actually, that	didn’t	take	me	much	time	at	all,	because	in	addition	to	the	standard	 <i class="calibre3">Joy	 of</i> <i class="calibre3">Cooking</i>	 and	  <i class="calibre3">Better	 Homes	 and	 Gardens</i>	 cookbooks,	 I	 found	 several	 specialty ones,	including	a	title	dedicated	to	cooking	all	sorts	of	game	meats,	starting	with rabbit	and	quail	and	moving	up	from	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 that,	 it	 was	 a	 matter	 of	 poring	 over	 the	 recipes	 and	 deciding	 which sounded	best	—	and	one	for	which	I	had	actually	had	all	the	ingredients	on	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 decided	 that	 the	 rabbit	 with	 mustard	 sauce	 variation	 sounded	 good.	 Since	 I’d already	 harvested	 some	 onions	 and	 garlic	 from	 the	 greenhouse	 a	 few	 days earlier,	all	I	had	to	do	was	rescue	the	onion	from	the	fridge	and	the	garlic	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	little	terra-cotta	keeper	that	sat	on	the	counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	I	did	that,	I	couldn’t	help	worrying	that	Jace	would	come	back	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">couple	of	rabbit	carcasses	and	expect	me	to	skin	and	dress	them,	his	work	as	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">he-man	hunter	done.	I	didn’t	know	the	first	thing	about	doing	any	of	that.	Hell,	I could	barely	cut	up	a	whole	chicken	properly.	My	mother	showed	me	how	to	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 once,	 but	 I’d	 protested	 the	 whole	 time	 that	 you	 could	 buy	 already	 cut-up chicken,	so	what	was	the	point?	Wasting	a	half	hour	on	that	sort	of	exercise	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	save	a	dollar	or	so	on	the	price	of	the	meat	had	hardly	seemed	worth	it	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	had	annoyed	her,	I	could	tell;	she	was	probably	flashing	back	to	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 and	 my	 father	 first	 got	 married,	 when	 she	 was	 substitute	 teaching	 while trying	 to	 get	 a	 full-time	 position,	 and	 he	 was	 still	 a	 rookie	 right	 out	 of	 the Academy.	Money	had	been	tight.	I	understood	that	intellectually,	but	twenty-five</p>
<p class="calibre1">years	later,	it	seemed	a	little	extreme	to	be	worrying	about	a	few	cents	a	pound</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	chicken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	at	least	she	had	taught	me	to	cook	—	not	Cordon	Bleu	or	anything,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">how	 to	 make	 a	 roast	 and	 how	 to	 prepare	 a	 variety	 of	 potato	 dishes	 and	 lots	 of veggies,	 sauces,	 that	 sort	 of	 thing.	 I	 knew	 I	 wouldn’t	 have	 to	 worry	 about poisoning	 Jace	 if	 he	 did	 somehow	 manage	 to	 bring	 back	 a	 rabbit,	 even	 with Dutchie’s	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Until	they	did	return,	I	wasn’t	about	to	get	anything	started.	I	assembled	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ingredients	on	the	kitchen	counter,	went	down	to	the	cellar	to	get	some	potatoes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	then	found	a	tablecloth	and	some	matching	napkins	on	one	of	the	shelves	in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>the	laundry	room.	This	would	be	the	first	time	we’d	sat	down	at	the	dining	room table,	as	his	first	few	nights	here,	Jace	had	eaten	with	me	at	the	little	breakfast set	in	the	kitchen	nook.	For	some	reason,	that	had	felt	safer	to	me.	There	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">certain	ritual	associated	with	sitting	down	to	a	real	meal	at	a	dining	room	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	I	was	making	too	much	out	of	his	going	rabbit-hunting.	It	wasn’t	as	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	wouldn’t	be	eating	a	lot	of	that	sort	of	thing	in	the	future,	if	it	turned	out	he really	was	handy	with	that	.22.	Then	again,	making	an	occasion	out	of	it	might</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	us	both	feel	a	little	better	about	our	current	situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	thought	seemed	to	reassure	me,	so	I	went	ahead	and	finished	setting	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">table,	 completing	 the	 setup	 with	 the	 long	 wrought-iron	 candleholder	 that	 had been	 sitting	 on	 the	 sideboard.	 It	 held	 five	 pillar	 candles,	 and	 would	 provide plenty	of	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Candlelit	dinners? </i>	I	asked	myself.  <i class="calibre3">Boy,	you	really	are	asking	for	trouble. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	decided	if	Jace	asked,	I’d	say	it	was	a	good	way	to	save	energy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 returned	 an	 hour	 or	 so	 later,	 Dutchie	 bounding	 along	 beside	 him,	 and	 a very	 messy	 bundle	 of	 rabbit	 dangling	 from	 a	 bag	 in	 one	 hand.	 So	 he	 had	 done the	butchering	for	me,	probably	guessing	that	asking	me	to	handle	that	particular</p>
<p class="calibre1">duty	would	have	damaged	my	delicate	sensibilities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,”	I	said,	taking	the	bundle	from	him.	“I	found	a	recipe	with	mustard</p>
<p class="calibre1">sauce.	Does	that	sound	okay	to	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sounds	great,”	he	replied.	He	was	windblown,	but	looked	far	more	relaxed</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 happy	 than	 he	 had	 when	 he	 was	 telling	 me	 about	 how	 he	 had	 left	 Taos. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Getting	out	in	the	fresh	air	and	away	from	the	house	seemed	to	have	done	him	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">world	of	good.	“I	need	to	get	cleaned	up.	Can	you	manage	things	from	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 another	 world,	 I	 might	 have	 complained	 about	 having	 to	 do	 the	 typical female	thing	of	cooking,	now	that	he’d	bagged	his	bunnies.	Actually,	though,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	just	grateful	that	he	even	had	the	ability	to	go	out	and	get	us	food.	He	knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">how	to	hunt;	I	knew	how	to	cook.	It	seemed	a	pretty	fair	division	of	labor	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	I	stood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bundle	of	rabbit	parts	was	a	little	bloodier	than	something	I	would	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">gotten	from	the	supermarket,	but	I	wasn’t	so	squeamish	that	I	couldn’t	handle	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	rinsed	everything	off	and	patted	it	dry,	then	sprinkled	the	pieces	with	salt	and pepper	while	warming	up	some	olive	oil	in	a	pan.	As	the	rabbit	was	browning, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace	returned	to	the	kitchen,	face	and	hands	looking	freshly	scrubbed,	and	asked</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	I	needed	help	peeling	the	potatoes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Okay,	 so	 much	 for	 my	 worry	 about	 thinking	 he	 was	 going	 to	 sit	 on	 his	 ass and	watch	a	DVD	of	 <i class="calibre3">Die	Hard</i>	or	something	while	I	labored	away	in	the	kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	I	said.	“Thanks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	went	to	work,	being	sparing	with	the	water,	for	which	I	was	grateful.	So</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>far	 it	 seemed	 as	 if	 the	 well	 could	 manage	 just	 about	 anything	 we	 threw	 at	 it, including	daily	showers	for	the	two	of	us,	but	it	never	hurt	to	be	careful.	I	used to	take	long,	hot	showers,	the	kind	that	would	basically	kill	all	the	hot	water	in the	place	by	the	time	I	was	done,	but	once	I	got	here,	I	retrained	myself	so	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole	 procedure	 only	 took	 five	 minutes.	 Not	 the	 easiest	 of	 tasks	 at	 first,	 but things	did	get	sped	up	when	you	didn’t	have	to	worry	about	shaving	your	legs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	risked	a	glance	at	Jace,	thinking	I	wouldn’t	mind	having	to	go	back	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole	leg-shaving	thing	if	the	situation	warranted	it.	But	that	day	seemed	far	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">—	if	it	ever	came	at	all	—	so	in	the	meantime,	I	was	pretty	sure	my	five-minute</p>
<p class="calibre1">showers	were	safe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither	of	us	spoke,	but	it	was	a	companionable	sort	of	silence,	him	peeling</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 potatoes,	 me	 working	 away	 at	 the	 sauté	 pan,	 following	 the	 steps	 of	 the recipe.	 He	 did	 stop	 to	 ask	 whether	 I	 wanted	 the	 potatoes	 sliced	 or	 cut	 up	 or whatever,	but	since	I	was	planning	on	mashing	them,	he	didn’t	have	to	do	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">besides	quarter	them	and	put	them	in	a	pot	of	cold	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	you	need	milk	for	mashed	potatoes?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	evaporated	milk	in	the	pantry.	It	won’t	be	quite	the	same,	but	I	think</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’ll	be	okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could	tell	by	the	way	his	brows	drew	together	that	he	wasn’t	exactly	thrilled</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 the	 idea	 of	 evaporated	 milk,	 but	 he	 didn’t	 say	 anything,	 only	 went	 over	 to fetch	the	box	and	then	mix	up	a	batch	for	me.	Well,	if	it	was	that	big	a	problem, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 next	 day	 I’d	 send	 him	 off	 in	 search	 of	 any	 stray	 goats	 that	 might	 be wandering	 the	 area,	 looking	 for	 a	 home.	 Dutchie	 would	 probably	 be	 ecstatic	 at the	prospect	of	that	sort	of	expedition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 dog	 had	 definitely	 latched	 on	 to	 Jace.	 Maybe	 she’d	 been	 more	 bonded with	Mr.	Munoz,	back	in	Albuquerque.	Or	maybe	Jace	was	one	of	those	people</p>
<p class="calibre1">whom	dogs	tended	to	love.	I	didn’t	know,	and	in	the	end,	it	didn’t	matter.	Jace</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	Dutchie’s	new	best	friend.	It	didn’t	bother	me	as	much	as	I	thought	it	might</p>
<p class="calibre1">have,	 simply	 because	 Dutchie	 had	 proved	 herself	 to	 be	 a	 decent	 judge	 of character.	If	she	liked	Jace,	it	must	mean	he	was	okay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 dark	 by	 the	 time	 dinner	 was	 ready.	 Jace	 and	 I	 carried	 the	 various platters	and	bowls	to	the	dining	room	table,	and	I	brought	out	some	matches	I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">found	 in	 the	 kitchen	 so	 I	 could	 light	 the	 pillars	 in	 their	 wrought-iron	 holder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	my	asking,	Jace	turned	off	the	overhead	fixture,	so	all	we	had	was	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">candlelight.	It	danced	off	the	heavy	glass	goblets,	the	dark	bottle	of	cabernet	that sat	waiting	to	be	drunk.	The	walls	in	this	room	were	a	warm	parchment	yellow, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	seemed	to	reflect	the	glow	of	the	candles	and	multiply	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow,”	 Jace	 murmured.	 “I	 hadn’t	 expected	 to	 see	 anything	 like	 this	 ever again.”	 Then	 he	 shook	 his	 head.	 “Wait	 —	 I	 don’t	 think	 I’d	 ever	 seen	 anything</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>like	this	 <i class="calibre3">before</i>,	either.	It	looks	beautiful,	Jessica.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,”	 I	 said,	 my	 tone	 almost	 shy.	 Now	 that	 I	 was	 with	 him	 in	 this intimate	space,	would	he	take	all	this	for	more	than	I	had	intended,	as	some	sort</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	seduction	or	something? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	there	wasn’t	anything	I	could	do	about	it	now.	I	pulled	out	my	chair	—</p>
<p class="calibre1">obscurely	glad	that	he	hadn’t	offered	to	do	it	for	me	—	and	sat	down.	A	second</p>
<p class="calibre1">later,	he	followed	suit,	lifting	the	cloth	napkin	I’d	set	out	and	placing	it	in	his	lap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 he	 raised	 the	 bottle	 of	 wine,	 which	 he’d	 already	 opened	 back	 in	 the kitchen,	and	poured	some	of	the	cabernet	into	my	glass	first,	and	then	his. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	we	should	have	a	toast,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	should	we	toast	to?”	Not	being	dead	seemed	the	obvious	choice,	but	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	crass	to	voice	the	thought	aloud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 seemed	 to	 think	 about	 it	 for	 a	 moment,	 his	 glass	 a	 few	 inches	 off	 the tabletop.	 The	 candlelight	 gleamed	 against	 his	 raven-dark	 hair,	 and	 again	 I wondered	what	it	would	feel	like	to	run	my	fingers	through	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	sanctuary,”	he	said	at	last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	definitely	on	board	with	that.	Even	if	nothing	ever	happened	between</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace	and	me,	we	had	found	a	quiet	haven	here,	a	place	to	shelter	from	whatever</p>
<p class="calibre1">might	 be	 going	 on	 outside	 in	 the	 world.	 “To	 sanctuary,”	 I	 echoed,	 raising	 my glass	as	well	and	clinking	it	against	his. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 brief	 silence	 fell	 as	 we	 both	 swallowed	 some	 of	 the	 wine.	 It	 wasn’t	 as heavy	as	the	Montepulciano	I’d	drunk	a	few	days	earlier.	I	could	taste	the	fruit	in it,	and	thought	it	was	probably	a	good	choice	to	go	along	with	the	sharpness	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	mustard	sauce	I’d	made	for	the	rabbit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 we	 both	 dug	 into	 the	 main	 dish,	 which	 turned	 out	 to	 be	 excellent.	 I wasn’t	sure	why	I’d	avoided	rabbit	before	this,	because	I	found	myself	liking	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">taste. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Good	thing,	too, </i>	I	thought,  <i class="calibre3">because	you’re	probably	going	to	be	eating	a	lot</i> <i class="calibre3">of	it	in	the	future. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">And	the	mashed	potatoes	actually	were	fine,	even	with	the	evaporated	milk, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	there	was	fresh	bread	and	butter	and	roasted	carrots.	It	really	was	quite	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">feast,	 especially	 considering	 I’d	 had	 to	 work	 with	 what	 was	 available	 in	 the cellar	and	the	greenhouse.	No	more	popping	down	to	the	grocery	store	to	get	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	special	ingredient. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is…amazing,”	Jace	finally	said,	after	making	some	serious	inroads	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	food	on	his	plate.	“Were	you	a	chef	or	something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hardly.”	I	took	a	sip	of	wine	to	cover	my	embarrassment,	cheeks	flaming.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">really	needed	to	get	this	blushing	thing	under	control	one	way	or	another.	“My</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother	 taught	 me	 how	 to	 cook.	 That	 is,	 she	 pointed	 out	 that	 it	 was	 mostly</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>following	 directions,	 at	 least	 for	 the	 basic	 stuff.	 So…that’s	 what	 I	 did	 tonight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Followed	directions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	still	pretty	incredible.”	Expression	thoughtful,	he	drank	some	of	his	own</p>
<p class="calibre1">wine.	“So	what	did	you	do?	Before,	I	mean.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	getting	my	master’s	at	UNM,	so	I	T.A.’d	a	couple	of	courses.	English</p>
<p class="calibre1">—	a	lot	of	paper	grading,	mostly.”	I	broke	off	a	piece	of	bread	but	didn’t	eat	it, just	sort	of	rolled	it	between	my	finger	and	thumb.	“What	about	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	graduated	from	UNM	four	years	ago,	then	came	back	to	Taos.”	He	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	me	directly	then,	as	if	studying	my	features,	and	it	was	difficult	to	remain	as	I was,	to	not	glance	away.	“We	must	have	been	there	at	the	same	time,	but	I	guess</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	 wouldn’t	 have	 been	 much	 overlap.	 You’d	 have	 been	 a	 freshman	 when	 I was	a	senior.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could	have	sworn	his	expression	was	somewhat	regretful,	but	I	didn’t	want</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	read	too	much	into	it.	That	way	only	lay	disappointment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyway,”	he	went	on,	“after	that	I	went	back	to	Taos.	I	conducted	tours	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 pueblo	 part	 of	 the	 time,	 and	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 time	 I	 worked	 on	 getting	 my business	going.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	kind	of	business?”	I	asked,	after	finally	remembering	to	eat	the	piece</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	bread	I	was	holding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Website	 and	 graphic	 design.	 I	 did	 some	 work	 for	 the	 local	 businesses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mostly	advertising	stuff.	The	tours	paid	a	lot	better.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	revelation	surprised	me.	“They	did?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	yeah.”	He	got	himself	a	piece	of	bread,	then	buttered	it.	When	he	went</p>
<p class="calibre1">on,	 he	 wore	 a	 rather	 sardonic	 smile.	 “You’d	 be	 amazed	 how	 much	 the	 tourists were	 willing	 to	 part	 with.	 On	 a	 good	 day,	 I	 could	 make	 around	 three	 hundred bucks.	White	guilt	is	expensive,	I	guess.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	just	stared	at	him,	and	he	hurried	to	say, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	 offense.	 But	 I	 think	 that’s	 part	 of	 why	 they’re	 willing	 to	 hand	 over	 a twenty	—	or	more	—	for	a	half-hour	tour	of	the	pueblo.”	His	gaze	sharpened	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">me,	and	again	I	had	to	force	myself	to	look	back	at	him	directly.	“Anyway,	I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">say	to	look	at	you,	you	must	have	some	First	Nations	blood	back	in	the	woodpile</p>
<p class="calibre1">yourself.	Or	am	I	overreaching?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 that	 was	 it	 —	 he	 was	 just	 inspecting	 my	 appearance	 in	 an	 attempt	 to determine	my	own	origins.	Fair	enough.	Would	he	feel	better,	knowing	I	had	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Native	American	heritage	of	my	own?	“No,	you’re	not	overreaching,”	I	replied, </p>
<p class="calibre1">glad	 I	 sounded	 calm	 and	 unruffled.	 “Family	 legend	 has	 it	 that	 my	 great-great-great-grandmother	was	full-blood	Ute.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even	 better,”	 Jace	 said,	 a	 certain	 warmth	 in	 his	 eyes	 doing	 unexpected things	to	my	midsection.	“The	Ute	and	the	Pueblo	were	on	very	good	terms	back</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a>in	the	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	 in	 the	 world	 was	 I	 supposed	 to	 say	 to	 that?	 Was	 Jace	 hoping	 that	 he and	I	would	be,	as	he	put	it,	“on	very	good	terms”?	Not	that	I	thought	I	would	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">opposed	to	such	a	shift	in	our	relationship,	but	we’d	only	known	each	other	for	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">couple	of	days.	I	certainly	didn’t	intend	to	rush	into	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 that’s	 good	 to	 know,”	 I	 remarked.	 “At	 least	 I	 won’t	 have	 to	 worry about	tribal	warfare	breaking	out	in	the	laundry	room	or	something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	second	or	two,	he	didn’t	reply,	only	stared	at	me,	and	I	hoped	I	hadn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">offended	 him.	 But	 then	 he	 chuckled,	 reached	 for	 the	 wine	 bottle,	 and	 poured some	 more	 into	 my	 glass.	 Still	 smiling,	 he	 said,	 “No,	 I	 don’t	 think	 we	 have	 to worry	about	any	conflict	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	all	I	could	do	not	to	shiver.	No	matter	what	he	said,	though,	I	wouldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">take	for	granted	this	current	harmony	and	goodwill	lasting	indefinitely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	could	it,	when	we	were	such	strangers	to	one	another? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a><img src="index-134_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="index-134_2.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">TWELVE</p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 somehow,	 strangely,	 that	 cooperation	 did	 continue.	 We	 fell	 into	 a	 sort	 of pattern	 after	 a	 few	 days	 —	 rising	 early,	 eating	 breakfast,	 which	 was	 toast	 or oatmeal	 most	 of	 the	 time,	 taking	 turns	 with	 our	 showers,	 getting	 dressed,	 then doing	 whatever	 needed	 to	 be	 done	 around	 the	 place.	 Jace	 was	 full	 of	 plans, abetted	by	some	of	the	books	and	manuals	he	found	in	the	office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 really	 should	 build	 a	 henhouse,”	 he	 said	 one	 morning,	 about	 a	 week after	he	showed	up.	“I	know	people	in	the	area	had	to	have	kept	chickens.	Eggs</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	a	good,	steady	source	of	protein.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	 are	 rabbits,”	 I	 replied,	 not	 bothering	 to	 point	 out	 that	 we’d	 been	 eating rabbit	at	least	every	other	day.	Wile	E.	Coyote	would	have	been	jealous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	 they	 are,”	 he	 said.	 “In	 the	 dead	 of	 winter,	 it	 might	 be	 more	 difficult. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	those	plans	I	found	for	a	henhouse	look	dead	easy.	We	just	need	to	get	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">supplies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What,	 you’re	 a	 carpenter	 and	 a	 web	 designer?”	 I	 asked,	 teasing.	 Sort	 of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	 I	 knew	 about	 building	 henhouses	 was	 roughly	 the	 same	 as	 what	 I	 knew about	 brain	 surgery	 —	 that	 is,	 nothing.	 I	 didn’t	 think	 I	 was	 going	 to	 be	 much help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shrugged.	“I	picked	up	a	few	things	here	and	there.	It’ll	be	fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 so,	 later	 that	 morning,	 we	 headed	 down	 into	 Santa	 Fe	 in	 search	 of	 a Home	 Depot,	 which	 wasn’t	 as	 easy	 as	 it	 might	 seem,	 considering	 we	 couldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>exactly	 Google	 its	 location.	 But	 we	 found	 a	 yellow	 pages	 inside	 an	 abandoned dentist’s	 office,	 and	 tracked	 down	 the	 store	 from	 there.	 It	 was	 a	 good	 ways outside	 the	 city	 center,	 so	 I	 was	 doubly	 glad	 that	 we’d	 looked	 it	 up	 instead	 of driving	aimlessly	all	over	the	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace	had	a	list	of	everything	he	needed,	and	we	“liberated”	one	of	the	trailers</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	used	to	be	able	to	rent	to	haul	your	building	supplies	home.	Thank	God	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">father	had	invested	in	a	tow	package	for	the	Cherokee,	even	though	we’d	never</p>
<p class="calibre1">actually	had	any	reason	to	use	it.	There	just	never	seemed	to	be	quite	enough	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	family	budget	to	buy	a	trailer	or	an	ATV. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 took	 a	 while	 to	 locate	 and	 then	 load	 all	 the	 necessary	 supplies	 —	 partly because	we	both	kept	finding	things	we	thought	would	be	useful	and	figured	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">might	as	well	add	them	to	the	haul.	But	after	the	back	of	the	SUV	was	packed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 rafters,	 and	 the	 trailer	 similarly	 loaded	 down,	 we	 drove	 off,	 moving	 slowly through	the	streets,	since	I	had	to	keep	zigging	and	zagging	to	avoid	abandoned</p>
<p class="calibre1">cars	 and	 trucks.	 We’d	 left	 Dutchie	 at	 home,	 much	 to	 her	 dismay,	 since	 we’d known	we	would	need	all	the	available	cargo	space	in	the	Cherokee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	kind	of	strange,	don’t	you	think?”	I	asked	Jace	after	we’d	cut	back	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	Cerrillo	and	were	heading	to	Alameda. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	strange?”	he	replied,	his	attention	still	on	the	list	he	held.	Maybe	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	worried	that	we’d	forgotten	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 we	 haven’t	 seen	  <i class="calibre3">anybody</i>.	 I	 mean,	 even	 with	 a	 99.8%	 mortality	 rate, there	should	still	be	a	couple	hundred	people	wandering	around	Santa	Fe,	right? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where	are	they?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	did	look	up	at	that	question,	his	gaze	drifting	to	the	empty	sidewalks	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">dark	windows	of	the	businesses	on	either	side	of	the	street.	“Lying	low?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe,”	 I	 said,	 but	 I	 wasn’t	 sure	 I	 believed	 it.	 By	 that	 point,	 it	 had	 been almost	a	month	since	the	Heat	first	began	to	spread	across	the	country.	Anyone</p>
<p class="calibre1">who	 was	 going	 to	 die	 was	 long	 dead.	 You’d	 think	 the	 survivors	 would	 be	 out foraging	in	earnest,	getting	ready	for	winter.	“It’s	just	weird	that	we	haven’t	seen a	single	person.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	want	to	find	more	people?”	His	tone	was	almost	sharp	as	he	asked</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	question,	as	if	he	thought	I	wasn’t	satisfied	with	his	company,	that	I	needed something	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	I	replied.	It	was	only	the	truth.	Part	of	me	wanted	to	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	 had	 happened	 to	 everyone,	 but	 after	 my	 experiences	 in	 Albuquerque,	 I wasn’t	 sure	 being	 around	 other	 people	 was	 such	 a	 good	 thing.	 Yes,	 Jace	 had turned	out	 to	 be	all	 right	 —	more	 than	 all	 right,	really	 —	 but	could	 I	 count	 on being	that	lucky	a	second	time? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	 could	 be	 hiding,”	 he	 said,	 his	 tone	 thoughtful.	 “Or	 gone	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>Albuquerque,	 thinking	 that	 maybe	 if	 any	 center	 of	 government	 still	 existed,	 it would	 be	 there,	 in	 a	 place	 where	 there	 would	 be	 more	 survivors.	 There	 are probably	a	lot	of	reasons	why	we’re	not	seeing	anybody.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 explanation	 sounded	 logical	 enough.	 If	 it	 hadn’t	 been	 for	 the	 voice urging	 me	 to	 get	 out,	 would	 I	 have	 left	 my	 hometown,	 or	 would	 I	 have	 stayed there	 in	 the	 hope	 that	 people	 might	 gather	 in	 what	 had	 been	 the	 state’s	 most populous	area? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wouldn’t	second-guess	myself,	not	now.	I	really	didn’t	know.	Then	again, </p>
<p class="calibre1">my	run-ins	with	Chris	Bowman	and	the	man	outside	Walgreens	might	have	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough	to	convince	me	that	it	was	time	to	get	out	of	Dodge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	right,	of	course,”	I	said,	and	he	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	okay,	Jess.  <i class="calibre3">We’re</i>	okay.	That’s	all	we	have	to	worry	about	right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh,	how	I	wanted	to	believe	him.	I	just	wasn’t	sure	if	I	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	henhouse	did	go	together	with	surprising	speed,	and	within	three	days’	time, </p>
<p class="calibre1">we	had	a	full-on	chicken	coop	with	space	for	six	hens	to	nest,	a	perch	that	Jace</p>
<p class="calibre1">built	from	a	closet	rod,	and	an	enclosed	run.	He	also	hung	a	light	overhead	so	the hens	 would	 be	 encouraged	 to	 lay	 even	 on	 gray	 winter	 days.	 It	 was	 all	 perfect, except…no	chickens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 we	 got	 in	 the	 Cherokee	 again,	 this	 time	 taking	 Dutchie	 with	 us,	 and started	 scouring	 the	 rural	 and	 semi-rural	 areas	 outside	 Santa	 Fe	 for	 any	 rogue chickens	who	needed	a	home.	It	actually	didn’t	take	as	long	as	I’d	thought;	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	 hour	 into	 our	 search,	 we	 found	 a	 house	 with	 a	 flock	 of	 chickens	 scratching away	 happily	 in	 the	 backyard,	 apparently	 unaware	 that	 the	 apocalypse	 had happened	 and	 they’d	 been	 left	 on	 their	 own.	 We	 gathered	 up	 six	 hens	 and	 the rooster,	who	was	less	than	pleased	at	being	plucked	out	of	his	yard	and	put	in	the back	 of	 an	 SUV.	 Jace	 was	 a	 little	 scratched	 up	 by	 the	 time	 the	 procedure	 was over,	but	in	the	end	we	had	everything	we	needed.	All	I	could	say	was	that	I	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	glad	I’d	had	the	forethought	to	lay	down	some	plastic	trash	bags	in	the	bed</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	SUV	before	dumping	the	chickens	back	there.	If	he’d	had	a	proper	grave, </p>
<p class="calibre1">my	father	would	have	been	rolling	over	in	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	took	a	few	days	for	the	chickens	to	settle	down	and	start	laying,	but	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	we	were	able	to	have	eggs	pretty	much	every	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>“Next,	the	goats,”	Jace	said	at	dinner	not	too	long	after	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	 you	 still	 on	 that	 kick?”	 I	 asked.	 All	 right,	 I	 had	 to	 say	 that	 the	 whole chicken	 thing	 was	 working	 out	 pretty	 well.	 But	 the	 thought	 of	 having	 goats roaming	around	the	property	intimidated	me	more	than	I	wanted	to	admit.	When</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	a	little	kid,	maybe	five	or	six,	my	parents	had	taken	me	to	a	petting	zoo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 had	 gone	 well	 until	 one	 of	 the	 goats	 decided	 to	 eat	 part	 of	 my	 sweater.	 I’d screamed	bloody	murder,	and	my	father	had	grimly	lifted	me	out	of	the	pen	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">carried	me	away.	Needless	to	say,	goats	weren’t	exactly	my	favorite	animals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I’m	still	on	that	kick.	We	ate	the	last	of	the	cheese	two	days	ago.”	His</p>
<p class="calibre1">dark	eyes	caught	mine,	and	he	grinned	at	me,	a	wicked	grin	I’d	come	to	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	 the	 past	 few	 weeks…and	 one	 that	 invariably	 made	 my	 knees	 go	 a	 little wobbly.	 So	 far	 I	 didn’t	 think	 Jace	 had	 noticed	 what	 kind	 of	 an	 effect	 it	 had	 on me,	 but	 still,	 I	 couldn’t	 help	 getting	 annoyed	 with	 myself	 for	 not	 having	 better self-control.	 He	 clasped	 his	 hands	 together	 and	 said	 in	 mock-earnest	 tones, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jessica,	do	you	want	to	consign	me	to	a	cheese-less	future?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 for	 God’s	 sake….”	 I	 couldn’t	 help	 smiling	 back	 at	 him,	 though,	 and	 I spread	 my	 hands	 in	 a	 gesture	 of	 surrender.	 “Okay,	 I	 give	 up.	 So,	 say	 we	 find some	goats.	How	do	you	plan	on	getting	them	back	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Easy,”	he	replied.	His	grin	now	had	an	element	of	triumph	in	it.	“We’ll	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">find	a	horse	trailer	and	put	them	in	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Easy.	Right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 with	 the	 henhouse	 supplies,	 we	 went	 foraging	 for	 the	 trailer	 first.	 There were	 a	 number	 of	 horse	 properties	 in	 the	 area,	 so	 that	 wasn’t	 too	 difficult.	 The odd	 thing	 was,	 just	 as	 I	 hadn’t	 seen	 any	 people	 on	 any	 of	 our	 expeditions,	 so, too,	were	there	no	horses	in	evidence	anywhere.	They	could	have	bolted,	kicked</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	the	fences	and	gates	when	it	became	clear	no	one	was	coming	to	feed	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	give	them	fresh	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 didn’t	 see	 any	 signs	 of	 that,	 though,	 and	 the	 voice’s	 words	 came	 back	 to me:	  <i class="calibre3">The	 animals	 will	 be	 taken	 care	 of. </i>	 So	 apparently	 I	 didn’t	 need	 to	 worry about	the	horses.	I	couldn’t	help	wondering,	though. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	 as	 I	 couldn’t	 help	 wondering	 what	 had	 happened	 to	 the	 voice.	 By	 that point,	I	hadn’t	heard	him	for	more	than	a	week.	Now	that	it	seemed	I	was	truly</p>
<p class="calibre1">settled	with	Jace,	maybe	the	voice	had	moved	on,	deeming	me	no	longer	in	need</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	any	assistance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wasn’t	sure	why,	but	that	thought	saddened	me	a	little.	I	hardly	wanted	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">admit	 it	 even	 to	 myself,	 but	 I	 missed	 the	 voice.	 If	 nothing	 else,	 he	 would	 have given	me	someone	else	to	talk	to…if	he’d	stuck	around.	A	few	times	when	Jace</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 out	 of	 the	 house	 and	 occupied	 with	 some	 task	 or	 another,	 I’d	 tried	 calling out	to	the	voice.	It	never	replied,	though,	and	at	last	I’d	given	up,	telling	myself</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>that	 if	 the	 voice	 didn’t	 need	 me,	 well,	 I	 didn’t	 need	 it,	 either.	 Intellectually,	 I knew	 I	 should	 let	 it	 go.	 But	 its	 absence	 bothered	 and	 worried	 me,	 despite	 my best	attempts	to	think	about	other	matters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace	 and	 I	 hit	 the	 goat	 jackpot	 on	 our	 second	 stop.	 Not	 only	 did	 we	 find	 a nice,	 largish	 horse	 trailer,	 but	 the	 property	 actually	 had	 goats	 roaming	 around, keeping	 the	 lawn	 cropped,	 doing	 their	 usual	 job	 of	 eating	 anything	 that	 wasn’t nailed	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	we	hooked	up	the	trailer	to	the	Cherokee,	then	had	a	little	convo	in	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	decided	having	four	goats	to	start	should	work	—	three	does	and	a	buck.	If	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned	 out	 the	 does	 didn’t	 produce	 enough	 milk	 or	 whatever,	 we	 could	 always come	 back	 and	 collect	 more	 of	 the	 herd.	 There	 seemed	 to	 be	 fifteen	 or	 so	 of them,	 although	 it	 was	 hard	 to	 get	 an	 exact	 count,	 what	 with	 the	 way	 they	 kept milling	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Choosing	 was	 difficult,	 because	 I	 had	 no	 idea	 what	 to	 look	 for	 in	 a	 goat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thank	God	Jace	wasn’t	quite	as	clueless,	and	he	managed	to	get	two	of	the	does</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	most	developed	milk	bags	up	into	the	trailer	without	too	much	trouble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	right,	that	looked	easy	enough,	so	I	started	to	do	my	best	to	urge	another	doe, a	pretty	animal	with	a	sleek	black	coat	and	fawn-colored	tipping,	in	the	general</p>
<p class="calibre1">direction	of	the	trailer.	She	just	bleated	at	me	and	trotted	off,	so	I	followed	her grimly,	 wishing	 Jace	 would	 stop	 messing	 around	 with	 the	 two	 he’d	 already gotten	in	the	trailer	so	he	could	help	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	 out	 of	 nowhere	 —	 wham!	 Something	 hard	 hit	 me	 square	 in	 the	 butt, and	 I	 went	 flying	 onto	 the	 ground.	 I	 blinked,	 wondering	 what	 the	 hell	 had happened,	and	then	realized	it	was	the	buck,	who	was	standing	a	few	paces	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	glaring	at	me	out	if	his	dark	amber	eyes.	It	seemed	he’d	taken	exception	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	maneuvering	that	one	doe,	and	had	butted	me	right	in	the	ass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	the	trailer,	I	heard	laughter,	and	I	scowled.	Jace	came	out,	grinning	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	where	I	sat	on	the	ground	in	a	pile	of	dirt	and	dead	weeds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very	funny,”	I	snapped.	“You	come	over	here	and	deal	with	this	bastard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,	but	the	way	he	got	you	right	in	the	—	” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Point	taken.”	I	began	to	push	myself	to	my	feet,	only	to	be	stared	down	by	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	angry-looking	buck.	Fine.	I’d	wait	here	until	Jace	took	care	of	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Which	he	did,	somehow	managing	to	circle	the	beast	and	then	urge	him	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 ramp	 into	 the	 trailer.	 How,	 I	 wasn’t	 quite	 sure.	 Hypnotism?	 Some	 magical Native	American	goat-charming	trick? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever	 it	 was,	 it	 worked.	 The	 buck	 headed	 right	 into	 the	 trailer	 as	 if	 it were	full	of	a	harem	of	does	in	heat,	and	the	last	doe,	the	one	I’d	been	trying	to manhandle,	trotted	after	him,	tail	swishing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Frigging	goats. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>Jace	came	over	to	me	and	extended	a	hand.	“Need	help?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	scowled	at	him	but	took	his	hand	anyway,	letting	him	pull	me	to	my	feet.	In</p>
<p class="calibre1">fact,	he	yanked	me	up	with	such	vigor	that	I	lost	my	balance	and	pitched	right</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	 him,	 colliding	 chest	 to	 chest.	 He	 took	 me	 by	 the	 arms	 and	 steadied	 me, holding	me	for	a	second	or	two	longer	than	he	really	needed	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	all	right?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh	 —	 ”	 Was	 I	 all	 right?	 My	 rear	 end	 ached,	 and	 I	 knew	 my	 jeans	 were covered	in	dirt,	but	in	that	moment	all	I	was	really	conscious	of	were	his	hands</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 my	 arms,	 the	 strength	 of	 the	 fingers	 wrapped	 around	 my	 biceps.	 Our	 faces were	only	inches	apart.	Blood	tingled	all	through	me,	and	I	knew	all	I	had	to	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	go	up	on	my	toes,	bring	my	mouth	to	his…. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No,	that	was	insane.	This	was	the	first	time	he’d	even	touched	me	since	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">held	me	when	I	wept,	on	the	day	he	had	first	come	to	the	compound.	Other	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 few	 sideways	 looks	 and	 glances	 I’d	 probably	 misinterpreted,	 he	 had	 done absolutely	nothing	to	show	he	had	any	interest	in	me	other	than	as	a	companion</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow	 I	 gathered	 myself,	 saying,	 “I’m	 fine,”	 and	 then	 gently	 pulled	 my arms	from	his	grasp.	He	didn’t	try	to	stop	me,	didn’t	tighten	his	grip	or	attempt</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	bring	me	closer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	there	was	my	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	dug	the	car	key	out	of	my	pocket	and	headed	to	the	driver-side	door	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cherokee,	while	Jace	went	around	the	other	side.	So	far	I	hadn’t	let	him	drive	the SUV,	 and	 he	 hadn’t	 pushed	 the	 matter,	 somehow	 sensing	 that	 having	 control over	the	vehicle	was	important	to	me.	Besides,	he’d	taken	to	driving	the	Polaris</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	 over	 the	 area	 around	 the	 compound,	 had	 used	 it	 to	 bring	 back	 a	 buck	 he’d shot	 one	 Saturday	 afternoon.	 The	 freezers	 were	 full	 of	 venison.	 Yes,	 Jace	 was very	handy	to	have	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	so,	I	didn’t	say	anything	to	him	on	the	trip	back	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	awkwardness	eased	itself	soon	enough,	as	it	had	to.	We	were	so	busy	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">getting	the	goats	set	up	and	then	foraging	for	feed,	reading	up	on	their	care	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	we	needed	to	do	to	ensure	the	does	were	properly	producing	milk,	that	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment	we	shared	back	in	their	corral	was	soon	pushed	aside,	if	not	forgotten. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>Of	course,	the	awkward	part	was	realizing	that	we	needed	to	breed	the	goats now	so	they	would	have	babies	in	the	spring,	and	therefore	more	milk.	Oh,	yeah, </p>
<p class="calibre1">discussing	 breeding	 options	 for	 farm	 animals	 with	 a	 guy	 you	 have	 a	 serious amount	of	unresolved	sexual	tension	with	is	a	whole	new	species	of	fun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	be	fair,	Jace	was	very	mellow	about	the	whole	thing,	and	didn’t	make	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">rude	jokes	or	indulge	in	any	cringe-worthy	innuendo.	He	spelled	out	the	whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing	 logically	 and	 factually,	 and	 then	 let	 the	 goats	 do	 the	 rest.	 It	 really	 wasn’t that	difficult;	a	buck	is	going	to	do	what	a	buck	is	going	to	do,	after	all.	I	was just	glad	that	I	managed	to	avoid	seeing	them	actually	do	the	deed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	 thing	 we	 didn’t	 have	 to	 worry	 about	 was	 the	 goats	 escaping	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">compound.	 They	 might	 come	 through	 and	 eat	 the	 ornamental	 plants	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">garden	 area	 directly	 off	 the	 back	 of	 the	 house,	 but	 there	 was	 no	 way	 even	 the most	ambitious	goat	could	jump	a	seven-foot-high	solid	adobe	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace	did	have	to	teach	me	to	milk	the	damn	things,	which	at	first	scared	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 no	 end,	 since	 I	 was	 sure	 I	 was	 going	 to	 end	 up	 with	 a	 hoof	 in	 my	 face	 the second	I	put	one	of	my	unpracticed	hands	on	the	animal’s	teat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 can	 just	 do	 it,	 you	 know,”	 I	 told	 him,	 hovering	 nervously	 in	 the background	as	he	sat	down	to	give	me	a	demonstration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	no,”	he	replied.	“Equal	division	of	labor	on	this	farm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 made	 a	 face	 but	 didn’t	 argue.	 It	 was	 true;	 I	 might	 have	 done	 most	 of	 the cooking,	but	he	did	the	hunting,	and	even	cleaned	out	the	chicken	coop	when	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	 foray	 into	 doing	 so	 proved	 I	 didn’t	 have	 the	 world’s	 strongest	 stomach.	 In return,	 I	 happily	 did	 his	 laundry.	 At	 least	 that	 way	 I	 was	 able	 to	 learn	 that	 he favored	dark-toned	boxer-briefs	over	tighty-whiteys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	that	hard,”	he	went	on,	his	voice	almost	too	coaxing.	“Just	watch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	placed	his	thumb	and	forefinger	near	the	top	of	the	doe’s	teat,	squeezing</p>
<p class="calibre1">it,	and	then	exerted	pressure	with	his	remaining	fingers	on	the	lower	part	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">teat.	A	thin	stream	of	white	liquid	emerged	and	went	into	the	glass	jar	he’d	set</p>
<p class="calibre1">beneath	it.	“See?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	yeah.	Easy	peasy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually,	 it	 isn’t.	 You	 have	 to	 exert	 a	 good	 deal	 of	 force.	 But	 that’s	 okay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 wants	 to	 be	 milked.”	 He	 did	 it	 again,	 and	 I	 watched	 his	 long	 fingers squeezing	 against	 her	 flesh.	 For	 a	 second,	 I	 had	 a	 brief	 flash	 of	 those	 fingers cupping	my	breast,	squeezing,	and	I	had	to	force	the	thought	out	of	my	mind.	No</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	 was	 I	 going	 to	 let	 myself	 get	 turned	 on	 by	 watching	 Jace	 milk	 a	 goat.	 He glanced	up	at	me.	“You	want	to	give	it	a	try?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	really	didn’t.	To	stall	for	time,	I	responded	with	a	question	of	my	own.	“Is</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	anything	you	can’t	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 appeared	 to	 consider,	 then	 said,	 “I	 don’t	 know	 how	 to	 play	 the	 violin. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a>Now	come	over	here	and	start	learning	how	to	milk	this	goat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heaving	 a	 sigh	 didn’t	 really	 seem	 appropriate,	 given	 the	 situation,	 so	 I waited	while	he	got	out	of	the	way	and	then	sat	down	on	the	old	packing	crate</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	were	using	as	a	milking	stool.	I	did	take	a	breath,	though,	before	placing	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">fingers	more	or	less	in	the	same	position	Jace	had	put	his. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,”	he	said,	watching	my	hands,	not	my	face.	“Now	squeeze	with	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">two	fingers	while	using	the	rest	to	push	the	milk	out	of	the	teat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh,	boy.	I	squeezed,	tentatively	at	first,	and	the	goat,	who	we’d	named	Aster</p>
<p class="calibre1">because	 of	 the	 little	 star-shaped	 mark	 on	 her	 haunch,	 shot	 me	 a	 look	 of	 pure irritation	over	her	shoulder.	But	at	least	she	hadn’t	kicked	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Harder	than	that,”	Jace	instructed	me,	but	his	voice	sounded	more	coaxing</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	annoyed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	definitely	didn’t	want	him	annoyed	with	me.	This	time	I	squeezed	harder, </p>
<p class="calibre1">exerting	so	much	pressure	that	I	was	certain	Aster	was	going	to	step	on	my	foot</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	protest.	Instead,	milk	squirted	into	the	bottle,	and	she	seemed	to	relax	slightly, letting	me	do	what	I	needed	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	letting	out	a	little	exhalation	of	relief,	I	went	back	to	milking	her.	More</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	more	milk	kept	squirting	out,	but	within	five	minutes,	the	fingers	of	my	right hand	were	aching	like	you	wouldn’t	believe.	I	tried	switching	to	the	other	hand, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 couldn’t	 get	 the	 angle	 right.	 After	 another	 minute,	 I	 sat	 back,	 shaking	 my head.	“I	can’t	do	any	more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 okay,”	 Jace	 said.	 His	 hand	 dropped	 to	 my	 shoulder	 and	 gave	 it	 a squeeze.	“It’s	going	to	take	some	time	to	develop	those	muscles.	I	can	finish	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 was	 probably	 my	 signal	 to	 relinquish	 the	 packing	 crate	 to	 him	 so	 he could	sit	down,	but	I	found	I	didn’t	want	to	move.	Not	with	his	warm	hand	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	shoulder,	the	pressure	of	it	somehow	delicious,	even	through	the	flannel	shirt</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	heavy	canvas	anorak	I	wore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 seemed	 to	 realize	 that	 as	 well,	 because	 he	 moved	 his	 arm,	 breaking	 the contact.	 At	 the	 same	 time,	 attempting	 to	 cover	 up	 the	 awkwardness	 of	 the moment,	I	got	to	my	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,	Jace.	I’ll	just	get	back	to	the	house,	then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grinning,	he	asked,	“How’s	the	butter	project	coming?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.	I’m	just	about	to	break	out	the	mixer	and	have	at	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Making	butter	had	turned	out	to	be	a	bigger	task	than	I’d	expected,	but	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	trial	and	error,	I’d	gotten	enough	buttermilk	ready	to	go	so	I	could	move	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	next	step.	At	least	we	had	power	in	the	house,	and	the	kitchen	had	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">equipped	with	a	fancy	stand	mixer.	Much	better	than	having	to	stand	around	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	butter	churn	the	way	they	did	it	in	the	bad	old	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’d	made	the	decision	to	use	a	good	deal	of	the	milk	for	making	butter	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>cheese,	since	neither	Jace	nor	I	was	what	you	would	call	a	big	milk	drinker.	Both of	those	projects	weren’t	exactly	what	you’d	call	user-friendly,	but	it	was	sort	of amazing	 how	 much	 extra	 time	 you	 had	 on	 your	 hands	 when	 you	 weren’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">spending	half	the	day	chatting	with	your	friends	on	Facebook	or	whatever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	still	hadn’t	decided	whether	that	was	a	good	thing	or	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">A	week	after	that,	I	stood	at	the	window	in	the	living	room,	looking	out	over	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">drive,	past	the	wall	to	the	landscape	beyond.	Heavy	clouds	blocked	the	sky,	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wondered	 how	 much	 we	 would	 get	 out	 of	 the	 solar	 panels	 today.	 We	 had	 a backup	 generator,	 but	 we	 hadn’t	 needed	 it	 yet.	 I	 was	 glad	 of	 that	 —	 the procedure	to	switch	over	from	the	solar	collector	to	the	electric	generator	didn’t sound	all	that	simple.	But	the	oven	ran	on	propane,	so	I’d	still	be	able	to	use	that, even	if	we	decided	to	dial	back	on	our	power	consumption	for	the	day.	All	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">heat	 came	 from	 the	 various	 fireplaces	 and	 the	 wood-fired	 stove	 in	 the	 sitting room,	so	the	interior	temperature	of	the	house	wouldn’t	be	affected,	one	way	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway,	it	wasn’t	the	possible	loss	of	power	that	had	me	staring	out	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">brooding	vista.	What	with	one	thing	or	another,	I	hadn’t	been	paying	that	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">attention	to	what	day	it	was,	although	I’d	dutifully	marked	off	each	one	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">calendar	in	the	office,	just	so	I	wouldn’t	completely	lose	track	of	time.	But	today, when	 I’d	 picked	 up	 the	 Sharpie	 to	 draw	 that	 thick	 black	 line,	 I’d	 paused	 and frowned	at	the	date	I	was	crossing	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">October	31st. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something	wrong?”	Jace	asked,	coming	into	the	living	room.	He	looked	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bit	surprised,	and	I	supposed	I	couldn’t	blame	him.	We	didn’t	spend	much	time</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	there,	beautiful	as	the	room	was.	Usually	we	were	either	in	the	kitchen	or	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">family	room,	or,	more	rarely,	the	office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	I	said,	then	paused.	“It’s	Halloween.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And?”	 His	 expression	 told	 me	 he	 wasn’t	 particularly	 impressed	 by	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">piece	of	information.	“Did	you	want	to	go	trick-or-treating	or	something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ha,”	 I	 replied.	 My	 trick-or-treating	 days	 were	 long	 behind	 me,	 although Elena	and	Tori	and	I	had	still	gone	out	on	Halloween,	mostly	as	an	excuse	to	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">dressed	 up	 and	 go	 to	 bars.	 I’m	 not	 going	 to	 lie	 —	 the	 year	 before,	 we	 all	 did</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>variations	on	the	“sexy”	something,	me	as	a	witch,	since	it	suited	my	long	near-black	 hair,	 Tori	 as	 an	 angel,	 and	 Elena…well,	 I	 still	 wasn’t	 entirely	 clear	 what her	 costume	 was	 supposed	 to	 be,	 except	 that	 it	 was	 black	 and	 red	 and	 sparkly, and	 showed	 way	 more	 leg	 than	 I	 would	 ever	 have	 dared.	 Needless	 to	 say,	 we didn’t	have	to	buy	any	of	our	own	drinks	that	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	the	trick-or-treating,”	I	said	slowly.	“It’s	more…I	don’t	know.	Like</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	date	is	telling	me	it’s	been	more	than	a	month	since…well,	since.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 light	 of	 humor	 in	 his	 dark	 eyes	 abruptly	 disappeared.	 “You’re	 right.	 I guess	I	hadn’t	really	thought	about	it,	what	with	everything	we’ve	been	doing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 closed	 the	 distance	 between	 us,	 coming	 to	 stand	 next	 to	 me	 in	 front	 of	 the window.	So	close,	and	yet…and	yet,	he	might	have	been	a	million	miles	away.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew	I	didn’t	have	the	courage	to	reach	out	and	take	his	hand	in	mine,	to	feel	the reassurance	of	his	touch.	Then	he	shifted	so	he	was	halfway	facing	toward	me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">his	gaze	fixed	on	my	profile.	“I	have	an	idea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 do?”	 I	 didn’t	 dare	 move,	 didn’t	 want	 him	 to	 see	 any	 of	 the	 yearning currently	 pulsing	 within	 me.	 I	 wished	 it	 could	 be	 different,	 but	 I	 just	 wasn’t brave	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tomorrow’s	the	Day	of	the	Dead.  <i class="calibre3">Dios	de	los	Muertos</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 smiled,	 but	 it	 was	 a	 grave,	 quiet	 smile.	 “I	 think	 there	 are	 a	 lot	 of	 dead who	need	to	be	honored.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a><img src="index-144_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="index-144_2.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">THIRTEEN</p>
<p class="calibre1">We’d	been	meaning	to	go	back	into	town	anyway,	but	had	been	putting	it	off	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	reason	or	another.	Well,	today	we	had	a	mission. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 drove,	 of	 course,	 since	 I	 still	 felt	 hinky	 about	 letting	 Jace	 get	 behind	 the wheel	of	my	father’s	Cherokee.	This	time	we	went	to	a	place	we’d	avoided,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Albertson’s	 grocery	 store	 near	 the	 center	 of	 town.	 So	 far,	 we’d	 either	 had everything	 we	 needed	 on	 hand,	 or	 we	 hunted	 or	 foraged	 for	 it.	 Although	 there were	 items	 we	 could	 have	 used	 from	 the	 store,	 neither	 of	 us	 thought	 it	 a	 very good	idea	to	go	in	there,	not	with	all	that	food	spoiling	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither	 did	 we	 know	 for	 sure	 what	 it	 would	 be	 like	 now,	 after	 having	 the power	cut	off	for	more	than	a	month,	but	it	was	the	best	place	we	could	think	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	get	some	of	those	saints’	candles	for	our	Day	of	the	Dead	observance.	Maybe</p>
<p class="calibre1">Santa	 Fe	 had	 a	 Hispanic	 grocery	 store	 somewhere,	 but	 I	 remembered	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Albertson’s	 because	 that’s	 where	 the	 girls	 and	 I	 stocked	 up	 on	 booze	 when	 we came	to	stay	at	Elena’s	parents’	timeshare. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pulled	into	the	parking	lot	of	the	Albertson’s,	then	reached	down	and	pulled</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	bandanna	I	had	wrapped	around	my	neck	up	and	over	my	mouth.	Jace	did	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same.	We	looked	like	we	were	there	to	hold	up	the	place,	but	it	seemed	the	best</p>
<p class="calibre1">solution,	since	we	didn’t	have	access	to	any	surgical	masks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ready?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Probably	not,	but	it	was	too	late	to	back	out	now.	Besides	the	candles,	there</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>were	a	number	of	nonperishable	goods	we	wanted	to	grab	—	paper	towels,	toilet paper,	rice,	flour,	sugar,	spices.	Of	course	Jace	didn’t	know	the	store	at	all,	but	I had	a	hazy	idea	of	where	some	things	were	located,	based	on	my	previous	visits</p>
<p class="calibre1">here.	I’d	just	have	to	hope	it	would	be	enough	to	get	us	in	and	out	as	quickly	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ready,”	I	said,	my	voice	muffled	by	the	bandanna	tied	over	my	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 got	 out	 of	 the	 Cherokee	 and	 headed	 toward	 the	 entrance	 to	 the	 store. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shopping	carts	had	been	abandoned	in	haphazard	order	in	front	of	the	building, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	we	each	grabbed	one.	We	also	both	held	big	crank-operated	flashlights,	part</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 emergency	 supplies	 at	 the	 compound,	 since	 my	 experience	 inside	 the Walgreens	in	Albuquerque	 had	taught	me	 that	those	little	 pen-sized	ones	 really didn’t	cut	it	when	you	were	trying	to	carry	out	a	salvage	operation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 glass	 in	 the	 door	 had	 been	 broken	 out	 and	 lay	 scattered	 all	 over	 the place,	 so	 it	 was	 a	 good	 thing	 that	 Jace	 and	 I	 both	 wore	 heavy	 hiking	 boots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shards	 of	 glass	 crunched	 underfoot	 as	 we	 pushed	 our	 way	 inside,	 flashlights bobbing	this	way	and	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	fairly	cold	that	day;	the	outside	temperature	reading	in	the	Cherokee</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	put	it	at	around	forty-six	degrees.	Maybe	that	was	a	good	thing,	as	it	kept	the smell	 from	 being	 too	 overwhelming,	 even	 with	 my	 nose	 covered.	 Oh,	 it	 was definitely	there,	something	sickly	sweet	and	yet	acrid	at	the	same	time,	but	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	overpowering	that	I	couldn’t	ignore	the	odor.	It	did	seem	to	catch	at	the	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 my	 throat,	 and	 I	 found	 myself	 breathing	 shallowly,	 pushing	 the	 cart	 grimly ahead	while	Jace	cut	off	to	the	right	to	canvass	that	side	of	the	store. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	people	might	have	said	that	was	foolish,	to	separate	like	that,	but	since</p>
<p class="calibre1">neither	of	us	had	seen	another	living	soul	in	weeks,	we	decided	it	was	a	risk	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	willing	to	take.	This	way	we	could	be	in	and	out	more	quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	moved	along,	panning	my	flashlight	over	the	shelves,	I	could	again	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">evidence	of	looting,	of	items	that	had	been	taken.	Breakfast	cereals	seemed	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">popular,	 for	 some	 reason.	 The	 vitamin	 aisle	 had	 also	 been	 almost	 cleaned	 out, although	I	found	some	bottles	of	multis	that	had	been	left	behind.	The	same	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 paper	 goods	 —	 a	 lot	 had	 been	 taken,	 but	 not	 all.	 I	 grabbed	 what	 I	 could, stacking	big	packages	of	toilet	paper	and	paper	towels	in	my	shopping	cart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 I	 came	 around	 the	 corner	 and	 found	 the	 real	 reason	 why	 we’d	 come there:	the	Hispanic	food	section.	I	was	sort	of	surprised	to	see	that	all	the	saint candles	 seemed	 undisturbed.	 Maybe	 people	 had	 been	 more	 interested	 in	 seeing to	their	physical	needs	than	their	spiritual	ones,	or	possibly	it	was	just	that	they hadn’t	thought	to	use	the	candles	for	lighting	after	the	power	failed.	Whatever.	It didn’t	matter	now.	What	mattered	was	that	I	was	able	to	scoop	up	a	dozen	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">things,	packing	them	in	and	around	the	toilet	paper	and	the	boxes	of	Kleenex	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a>all	the	other	items	I’d	picked	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got	’em!”	I	called	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace’s	voice	came	back	to	me	from	the	other	side	of	the	store.	“Great!	Go	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	to	the	Jeep	—	I’m	almost	done.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wasn’t	sad	to	hear	that	at	all.	This	grocery	store	wasn’t	quite	as	creepy	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 Walgreens	 had	 been,	 since	 the	 flashlight	 I	 held	 was	 far	 more	 effective	 than the	 one	 I’d	 had	 then.	 Besides,	 I	 knew	 Jace	 would	 come	 running	 the	 second	 I gave	the	alarm,	should	anything	strange	happen.	All	the	same,	I	was	glad	to	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	of	there,	out	of	the	lingering	stench	and	the	mournful	realization	that	nobody would	be	coming	by	to	restock	those	shelves	or	pick	up	the	items	that	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">knocked	to	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	was	beginning	to	load	my	haul	into	the	cargo	area	of	the	Cherokee,	Jace</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	out	as	well,	his	cart	full	to	the	brim	with	those	big	economy-size	bags	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">rice,	 boxes	 of	 salt,	 pepper	 grinders,	 container	 after	 container	 of	 spices	 —	 you name	 it,	 he	 seemed	 to	 have	 nabbed	 it	 from	 the	 bakery	 aisle,	 including	 some much-needed	tins	of	olive	oil.	We	had	some,	but	not	nearly	enough.	This	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">definitely	help	to	extend	our	supplies	for	a	good	many	more	months. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks	 like	 you	 plan	 to	 keep	 me	 chained	 to	 the	 stove	 for	 a	 good	 while longer,”	I	joked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	slanted	me	one	of	those	dark-lashed	looks	I	loved	so	much.	“Oh,	I	might</p>
<p class="calibre1">give	you	time	off	for	good	behavior.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	a	fact?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Absolutely.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	hint	of	a	smile	had	been	playing	around	the	corners	of	his	mouth,	but	as	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">watched,	 it	 faded.	 When	 I	 followed	 his	 gaze,	 I	 thought	 I	 understood	 why.	 I’d excavated	my	cart	to	the	point	where	all	that	was	left	were	the	saints	candles.	He reached	in	and	picked	one	up,	turning	it	over	in	his	hands.	From	her	blue	robe,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">guessed	the	saint	depicted	on	it	was	the	Virgin	Mary,	but	I	didn’t	know	for	sure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	family	wasn’t	Catholic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elena	would	have	known,	but	she	was	long	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	suppose	we’re	done	here,”	Jace	said.	It	wasn’t	a	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	I	told	him.	“Let’s	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a>Although	 we	 hadn’t	 discussed	 our	 plan	 in	 any	 detail,	 somehow	 we	 were	 both drawn	 to	 the	 monument	 at	 the	 center	 of	 the	 plaza.	 It	 seemed	 that	 here,	 in	 the heart	of	the	city,	was	the	best	place	to	pay	our	respects. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dead	leaves	had	scattered	over	the	walkways,	but	otherwise	the	place	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 if	 it	 hadn’t	 been	 touched	 since	 the	 last	 time	 I	 was	 here,	 when	 the	 voice	 had summoned	 the	 wind	 to	 sweep	 up	 the	 mess	 the	 looters	 had	 left	 behind.	 True, many	 of	 the	 stores	 had	 their	 windows	 broken	 in,	 but	 unlike	 at	 the	 Albertson’s, there	was	no	glass	scattered	on	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	to	wonder	how	much	of	that	detail	Jace	took	in	as	we	walked	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jeep	to	the	center	of	the	plaza.	Some,	it	seemed,	if	the	tight	lines	of	his	mouth</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 the	 puzzled	 furrow	 in	 his	 brow	 were	 any	 indication.	 But	 he	 didn’t	 ask	 any questions,	only	continued	to	the	monument	and	the	low	wall	that	surrounded	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	day	had	remained	dark,	the	clouds	threatening,	although	it	hadn’t	rained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 smelled	 like	 it	 might,	 though,	 heavy	 and	 damp.	 If	 it	 did,	 then	 these	 candles wouldn’t	last	very	long.	But	at	least	we	would	have	made	the	effort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still	 not	 speaking,	 we	 each	 took	 our	 burden	 of	 candles	 and	 placed	 them	 at regular	intervals	along	the	low	wall	surrounding	the	monument.	Jace	produced	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">box	 of	 strike-anywhere	 matches	 from	 the	 inner	 pocket	 of	 his	 jacket,	 then	 took one	out	and	used	the	rough	concrete	of	the	wall	to	get	it	started.	It	flared	up,	and he	cupped	it	in	his	hand,	moving	from	candle	to	candle	and	lighting	them	one	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">one.	They	flickered	in	the	chilly	wind	but	didn’t	go	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’d	waited	to	go	out	on	this	expedition	until	late	afternoon,	and	now	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost	dusk.	It	was	the	first	time	I’d	ventured	out	into	the	city	at	anywhere	close to	dark,	and	I	realized	how	very	black	it	would	soon	become,	especially	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cloud	 cover	 blocking	 out	 any	 possible	 moonlight	 or	 starlight.	 But	 we	 had	 our flashlights,	and,	for	the	moment	at	least,	the	candles	themselves	were	giving	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">far	more	illumination	than	I	had	expected	they	would. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace	glanced	over	at	me,	and	I	nodded.	This	had	been	his	idea,	after	all,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	I	thought	he	should	be	the	one	to	make	the	speeches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 a	 long	 moment,	 he	 didn’t	 speak,	 but	 only	 stood	 there	 in	 front	 of	 the candle	 with	 the	 Virgin	 Mary	 on	 it,	 the	 blue	 of	 her	 robe	 seeming	 to	 glow	 from within.	 Then	 he	 said,	 “We	 honor	 all	 those	 who	 walk	 in	 the	 paths	 of	 their ancestors.	 Those	 of	 us	 who	 are	 left	 here	 behind	 have	 so	 many	 questions, questions	we	know	will	never	be	answered.	But	our	thoughts	are	with	you,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	hope	you	have	all	found	peace	in	the	next	world.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	words	he	uttered,	I	couldn’t	understand,	and	I	realized	he	must	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">speaking	 the	 language	 of	 the	 Pueblo.	 The	 sound	 of	 it	 was	 slow	 and	 sad,	 but strong	 and	 rich	 as	 well,	 and	 I	 found	 something	 inside	 me	 unclenching	 for	 the first	time	since	I’d	left	Albuquerque.	True,	I	had	written	something	of	the	time</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a>before,	 in	 the	 little	 sketches	 I’d	 jotted	 down	 during	 my	 first	 days	 at	 the compound.	After	that,	though,	I	had	walled	away	my	grief,	thinking	that	the	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	 to	 survive	 and	 go	 on	 was	 not	 to	 think	 of	 everyone	 who	 was	 gone,	 of everyone	 I	 had	 lost.	 Now,	 hearing	 Jace	 speak,	 I	 knew	 that	 had	 been	 the	 wrong approach.	 I	 needed	 to	 celebrate	 who	 they	 were	 and	 what	 they	 had	 done,	 not pretend	they	had	never	existed.	That	was	doing	them	no	service,	giving	them	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">honor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace	 fell	 silent,	 and	 I	 could	 see	 the	 way	 he	 looked	 over	 at	 me,	 clearly expecting	 me	 to	 say	 something.	 How	 I	 was	 supposed	 to	 follow	 that,	 I	 had	 no idea.	But	no,	that	was	foolish.	This	wasn’t	a	competition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	miss	you	all,”	I	said	simply,	then	turned	and	began	to	walk	away	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">monument.	 I	 didn’t	 bother	 to	 turn	 on	 my	 flashlight,	 even	 though	 the	 sun	 had gone	down	by	then.	The	illumination	from	the	candles	was	enough	to	light	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">path. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	behind	me,	I	heard	the	sound	of	Jace’s	footsteps,	hurrying	a	little	so	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	catch	up	with	me.	And	then	I	felt	his	hand	slip	into	mine,	his	fingers	warm</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 strong,	 even	 though	 it	 was	 cold	 enough	 that	 we	 really	 should	 have	 been wearing	gloves.	My	own	fingers	felt	as	if	they’d	been	dipped	in	ice	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither	of	us	said	anything.	It	was	enough	then	to	walk	hand	in	hand	back	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 Jeep,	 to	 take	 comfort	 in	 the	 feel	 of	 human	 flesh	 pressed	 against	 mine, reassuring	in	the	dark	and	the	cold.	When	it	was	time	to	pull	the	car	key	out	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	pocket,	I	hesitated	for	a	fraction	of	a	second.	I	didn’t	want	to	let	go	of	him,	to relinquish	my	grip	on	his	fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	seemed	to	detect	my	reluctance,	because	he	stood	there	next	to	me	for	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment,	his	grip	tensing.	But	then	he	let	go	and	said,	“Let’s	get	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	couldn’t	argue	with	that.	The	night	wind	was	drilling	through	the	anorak	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wore	 as	 if	 it	 were	 made	 of	 gauze	 rather	 than	 sturdy	 canvas,	 and	 right	 then	 the thought	 of	 being	 surrounded	 in	 the	 warmth	 of	 our	 house	 seemed	 even	 more attractive	than	usual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	I	nodded	and	unlocked	the	Cherokee,	and	we	both	climbed	in.	After	I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">pulled	 away	 from	 where	 we	 were	 parked	 and	 was	 negotiating	 the	 narrow,	 car-choked	streets	—	a	task	far	more	difficult	after	dark	than	it	was	during	the	day</p>
<p class="calibre1">—	I	felt	Jace’s	hand	cover	mine	where	it	rested	on	the	gearshift. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	okay?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	couldn’t	take	my	eyes	off	the	road,	but	I	nodded.	“I	think	so.	That	was	—</p>
<p class="calibre1">”	The	exact	word	seemed	to	elude	me.	Moving?	Sad?	Satisfying?	All	those,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">more.	“It	helped,”	I	finally	said,	hoping	he	would	understand	what	I	meant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 appeared	 he	 did,	 because	 his	 fingers	 tightened	 around	 mine.	 All	 he	 said, though,	 was,	 “Good.”	 And	 then	 he	 let	 go,	 seeming	 to	 realize	 that	 I	 needed	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>focus	 on	 driving.	 Although	 I’d	 gone	 back	 and	 forth	 along	 this	 route	 several times,	it	had	always	been	during	the	day,	and	of	course	there	were	no	streetlights to	guide	me	along	my	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 flicked	 on	 the	 high-beams	 and	 slowed	 down.	 Good	 thing,	 too,	 because</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	 I	 finally	 got	 to	 it,	 I	 almost	 missed	 the	 turn-off	 to	 Upper	 Canyon	 Road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Muttering	 a	 curse,	 I	 angled	 the	 Cherokee	 onto	 the	 street	 at	 almost	 the	 last minute.	In	the	passenger	seat,	Jace	shifted,	but	he	remained	silent,	as	if	he	knew any	comments	on	my	driving	were	the	last	thing	I	needed	right	then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	bumped	along,	and	then	there	was	gravel	under	our	wheels	as	we	left	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">paved	road	and	began	to	head	up	the	winding	dirt	track	that	led	to	the	compound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	slowed	so	I	could	shift	into	four-wheel	drive,	and	when	I	looked	up,	I	let	out	a little	screech.	Three	pairs	of	eyes	seemed	to	glow	red	as	they	stared	straight	into the	Jeep’s	headlights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Coyotes,”	Jace	murmured.	“It’s	okay	—	just	drive	forward	slowly.	They’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	out	of	the	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Which	 they	 did,	 as	 I	 began	 to	 inch	 toward	 them.	 Somehow,	 though,	 their movements	 seemed	 almost	 leisurely,	 as	 if	 they	 weren’t	 too	 worried	 about	 me running	 them	 over.	 Almost	 at	 the	 last	 minute	 they	 got	 out	 of	 the	 way,	 but	 they only	 moved	 to	 the	 side	 of	 the	 road,	 where	 they	 stood	 and	 stared	 as	 we	 passed them	by. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	about	their	posture,	about	the	way	they	were	watching	the	Jeep, </p>
<p class="calibre1">made	the	hairs	stand	up	on	the	back	of	my	neck.	It	wasn’t	the	cold;	I’d	turned	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 heater	 as	 soon	 as	 we	 got	 inside	 the	 SUV.	 No,	 their	 unblinking	 surveillance just	felt…wrong.	Unnatural.	I’ll	admit	I	wasn’t	the	world’s	foremost	authority	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">coyotes,	 but	 in	 general,	 wild	 animals	 tended	 to	 scatter	 when	 confronted	 by something	as	large	and	intimidating	as	a	Jeep	Grand	Cherokee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 shot	 a	 sideways	 glance	 at	 Jace.	 He	 wasn’t	 looking	 at	 me,	 though,	 and instead	was	staring	out	the	passenger	window.	I	didn’t	know	how	much	he	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">even	see,	since	the	high-beams	were	illuminating	the	road	ahead	of	us,	not	either</p>
<p class="calibre1">side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	was	weird,”	I	said,	once	we	were	past	the	coyotes	and	they’d	melted</p>
<p class="calibre1">away	into	the	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	 little,”	 he	 agreed.	 Then	 I	 saw	 his	 shoulders	 lift.	 “Maybe	 they’re	 getting bold	 now	 that	 they	 don’t	 have	 to	 worry	 about	 getting	 run	 over	 every	 time	 they come	out	of	hiding.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	sounded	plausible.	But	still	a	note	of	wrongness	seemed	to	echo	inside</p>
<p class="calibre1">me,	and	I	couldn’t	help	thinking	there	had	to	be	more	to	it	than	that.	Then	again, the	world	had	ended	in	a	way	no	one	could	have	ever	predicted.	Things	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrong	for	weeks	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a>Well,	mainly.	I	risked	a	sideways	glance	at	Jace	and	saw	that	he	was	looking out	the	window	again,	his	fine	profile	faintly	illuminated	by	the	glow	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dashboard	lights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking	at	him,	I	knew	there	was	one	thing	right	in	my	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Although	 I	 cast	 worried	 glances	 from	 side	 to	 side	 as	 we	 approached	 the compound	 and	 I	 pushed	 the	 remote	 to	 open	 the	 gate,	 I	 saw	 nothing	 in	 the darkness,	 no	 gleaming	 red	 or	 yellow	 eyes	 of	 various	 wildlife	 just	 waiting	 to pounce.	 We	 came	 onto	 the	 property	 without	 incident,	 although	 I	 activated	 the controls	 for	 the	 gate	 as	 soon	 as	 our	 rear	 bumper	 had	 cleared	 it.	 The	 motion-activated	lights	above	the	garage	door	turned	on	as	we	approached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Off	in	the	distance,	I	did	see	a	shimmer	of	eyes	glowing	in	the	darkness,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	jumped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	okay,”	Jace	said	softly.	“It’s	just	the	goats.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	quite	relax,	but	I	did	let	out	my	breath.	“Oh,	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Was	 that	 a	 chuckle?	 When	 I	 glanced	 over	 at	 him,	 his	 expression	 was	 sober enough,	but	that	didn’t	necessarily	mean	anything.	Fine,	if	he	wanted	to	laugh	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	for	jumping	at	shadows	—	or	glowing	eyeballs,	in	this	case	—	I’d	let	him.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t	see	anything	wrong	with	staying	on	my	guard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	the	unpacking	of	the	Cherokee	passed	without	incident,	although	it	took</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer	than	I’d	expected	to	unload	all	that	stuff	and	get	it	safely	stowed.	Dutchie kept	wandering	between	us,	trying	to	track	all	the	new	and	interesting	smells	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	bringing	in	the	house,	until	at	last	I	bribed	her	with	a	chewy	treat	so	she’d get	out	from	underfoot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	then	it	was	moving	on	toward	seven	o’clock,	and	far	past	time	for	dinner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 I	 had	 all	 afternoon	 to	 figure	 out	 what	 to	 make	 and	 plenty	 of	 time	 to prepare	 it,	 I	 really	 didn’t	 mind	 cooking.	 Right	 now,	 though,	 I	 thought	 I	 might have	sold	my	soul	for	pizza	delivery.	Or	Chinese	takeout. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace	must	have	noticed	my	lack	of	enthusiasm	for	the	task	at	hand,	because</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	said,	“It’s	not	that	bad.	Look	what	I	brought	back.”	And	I	saw	that	he	held	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">package	 of	 fettucini	 in	 one	 hand	 and	 a	 jar	 of	 vodka	 cream	 sauce	 in	 the	 other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Add	some	of	that	rabbit	sausage	you	made	a	few	days	ago,	and	we’re	set.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could	have	kissed	him.	Actually,	I	realized	I	would	have	loved	to	have	an</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a>excuse	to	go	over	and	kiss	him,	but	I	wasn’t	sure	dry	pasta	and	pre-made	sauce were	a	good	enough	reason.	I	had	to	settle	for	smiling	and	saying,	“That	sounds</p>
<p class="calibre1">perfect.	Can	you	feed	Dutchie	while	I	get	this	going?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 nodded,	 setting	 the	 pasta	 and	 the	 jar	 of	 sauce	 down	 on	 the	 countertop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	dog,	seeing	that	he	was	heading	toward	the	pantry,	got	up	from	her	rug	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">went	bounding	over	to	him,	tail	wagging	wildly.	At	least	she	wasn’t	the	type	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">turn	 up	 her	 nose	 at	 kibble.	 She	 still	 got	 as	 excited	 about	 it	 as	 though	 we	 were feeding	her	T-bone	steak	or	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	they	were	occupied,	I	filled	a	big	stock	pot	with	water	and	set	it	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">stove,	then	found	a	smaller	pan	and	dumped	the	sauce	into	it,	setting	it	on	low</p>
<p class="calibre1">heat	on	the	back	burner.	The	sausages	were	being	stored	in	an	airtight	container</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 fridge,	 so	 I	 got	 them	 out	 and	 started	 them	 cooking,	 too.	 Actually,	 I	 was sort	 of	 surprised	 that	 they’d	 turned	 out	 as	 well	 as	 they	 had.	 Let’s	 just	 say	 that making	 sausages	 hadn’t	 exactly	 been	 in	 my	 cooking	 repertoire	 before	 this,	 but they	really	weren’t	that	difficult,	once	you	figured	out	how	it	all	worked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	just	starting	to	sizzle	away	when	Jace	came	over	to	the	stove	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">paused	to	sniff	the	air.	“Those	smell	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	said	the	same	thing	two	days	ago	when	we	had	them	for	the	first	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	 eyebrow	 went	 up.	 “So?	 Two	 days	 shouldn’t	 make	 them	 taste	 any	 less</p>
<p class="calibre1">good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	 not.	 I	 wasn’t	 going	 to	 argue	 the	 point,	 especially	 with	 him	 standing that	close	to	me,	barely	a	foot	away.	He’d	taken	off	his	jacket,	and	I	could	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 way	 the	 knit	 henley	 shirt	 he	 wore	 molded	 to	 the	 muscles	 in	 his	 arms	 and chest,	the	smooth	golden-brown	skin	where	he’d	left	one	button	undone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shit.	I	shouldn’t	be	staring.	Was	I	staring? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	a	feeling	I	was	staring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blood	rose	to	my	cheeks,	and	I	turned	back	to	the	skillet,	making	something</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	a	show	of	turning	the	sausages	over.	I	also	took	a	pot	holder	and	lifted	the	lid on	the	pot	of	pasta	water	to	check	on	it,	but	it	wasn’t	boiling	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	was	setting	the	pot	holder	down	on	the	counter,	I	felt	a	hand	settle	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	waist,	turn	me	around.	Jace	was	even	closer	now,	dark	eyes	fixed	on	my	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	touch	of	his	fingers	through	the	long-sleeved	T-shirt	I	wore	seemed	to	burn</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	swallowed,	thinking	I	needed	to	say	something.	But	words	had	fled,	leaving</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	alone	with	him,	with	the	need	I	now	saw	in	those	dark	eyes.	I	recognized	it	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">once,	because	I’d	felt	the	same	thing	myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then…oh,	 God…he	 was	 bending	 toward	 me,	 his	 mouth	 suddenly	 on</p>
<p class="calibre1">mine,	 his	 lips	 strong,	 urgent.	 I	 tasted	 him,	 felt	 him	 taste	 me,	 and	 then	 I	 was pressed	against	him,	feeling	the	shocking	solidity	of	his	body,	the	power	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>muscles	in	the	arms	that	were	now	going	around	me,	bringing	me	even	closer,	as if	he	needed	every	inch	of	me	to	be	touching	every	inch	of	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Why	 now? </i>	 some	 part	 of	 me	 asked,	 but	 the	 rest	 of	 my	 mind	 and	 body	 and soul,	 all	 those	 parts	 that	 had	 been	 aching	 for	 him	 for	 days…for	 weeks…they didn’t	care	so	much.	It	was	enough	that	here,	in	this	moment,	Jace	was	kissing</p>
<p class="calibre1">me,	and	I	was	kissing	him	back,	letting	him	know	I’d	wanted	this,	too,	more	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	could	ever	know.	Every	nerve	and	cell	in	my	body	seemed	to	be	responding, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pulsing	with	heat.	Had	it	ever	felt	like	this	before?	I	didn’t	know,	because	Jace</p>
<p class="calibre1">kissing	 me	 seemed	 to	 have	 wiped	 away	 my	 memories	 of	 every	 other	 kiss	 I’d ever	experienced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	hissing	sound	interrupted	us,	though,	and	Jace	let	go	of	me	abruptly.	“The</p>
<p class="calibre1">water’s	boiling,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">That’s	not	the	only	thing	boiling, </i>	I	thought,	but	I	didn’t	answer,	only	lunged for	the	pot	holder	so	I	could	lift	the	lid	on	the	stock	pot	and	then	turn	down	the heat	to	a	more	reasonable	level.	Those	mundane	tasks	helped	me	gather	myself	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bit,	 although	 I	 could	 still	 feel	 the	 blood	 thrumming	 and	 throbbing	 in	 my	 veins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 wasn’t	 the	 only	 thing	 throbbing,	 either.	 I	 wouldn’t	 say	 I	 was	 the	 kind	 of person	who	got	turned	on	easily	—	as	my	asshole	ex-boyfriend	had	complained</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	more	than	one	occasion	—	but	right	then	I	was	so	aroused	that	Jace	probably</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 have	 laid	 me	 out	 flat	 on	 the	 kitchen	 counter	 and	 taken	 me	 there	 with absolutely	no	complaints. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	 backed	 away	 slightly,	 though,	 seemed	 content	 to	 watch	 as	 I	 dumped</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 fettucini	 into	 the	 boiling	 water	 and	 then	 turned	 the	 sausages	 over	 once again.	 It	 was	 only	 after	 I	 gave	 the	 vodka	 sauce	 a	 quick	 stir	 that	 he	 said,	 “You didn’t…mind	that,	did	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mind	it?”	I	asked.	We	now	stood	facing	one	another,	my	back	to	the	stove. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	calm	enough,	but	I	thought	I	could	detect	a	certain	hard,	bright	glint</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	his	eyes	that	I’d	never	seen	before.	Arousal?	I	couldn’t	tell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 realized	 I	 didn’t	 know	 him	 well	 enough	 to	 guess.	 Yes,	 we’d	 been	 living under	the	same	roof	for	almost	three	weeks	now,	but	we’d	always	been	careful</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	 one	 another,	 making	 sure	 we	 didn’t	 cross	 any	 lines,	 didn’t	 blunder through	any	barriers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	those	barriers	were	pretty	well	knocked	down	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	—	I	didn’t	want	you	to	think	I	was	forcing	you	or	anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	 he	 appeared	 almost	 worried,	 the	 gleam	 gone	 from	 his	 eyes,	 leaving</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	sober	and	dark,	so	dark	I	couldn’t	really	tell	where	the	pupils	ended	and	the irises	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Forcing	me?	That	was	a	joke.	I’d	wanted	that	kiss,	but	had	worried	that	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">growing	feelings	for	him	weren’t	reciprocated. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>“I	mean,	after	what	happened	to	you	in	Albuquerque	—	” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Time	to	disabuse	him	of	that	notion.	I	set	the	spoon	down	on	the	little	stone</p>
<p class="calibre1">rest	 we	 used	 to	 keep	 our	 cooking	 utensils	 off	 the	 counter,	 then	 went	 over	 and took	his	hands	in	mine,	right	before	I	went	on	my	tiptoes	and	kissed	him	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lips.	 A	 fast	 kiss,	 not	 like	 the	 breath-stealing,	 knee-knocking	 one	 we’d	 shared	 a few	 moments	 earlier,	 but	 still	 enough	 that	 he	 should	 understand	 that	 I	 liked kissing	him	very	much	indeed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 isn’t	 Albuquerque,”	 I	 told	 him.	 “And	 you’re	 nothing	 like…either	 of them.”	To	be	fair,	I	didn’t	even	know	for	sure	that	the	man	who’d	wanted	to	steal</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Cherokee	had	the	same	designs	on	me	that	Chris	Bowman	did,	but	I’d	gotten</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	impression	his	intentions	weren’t	exactly	benign.	“And	I’ve	wanted…this…</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	a	long	time.	I	just	wasn’t	sure	it	was	what	 <i class="calibre3">you</i>	wanted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	tense	set	of	his	shoulders	seemed	to	relax	slightly,	and	he	even	grinned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 I	 wanted	 it,	 too.	 But	 I	 didn’t	 want	 to	 push	 you.	 I	 could	 tell	 you’d	 been through	a	lot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	both	have,”	I	said	simply.	No	need	to	go	into	it	any	more	than	that.	He’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">lost	 everything,	 and	 I’d	 lost	 everything.	 Through	 some	 miracle,	 though,	 we’d both	come	to	this	place,	come	to	the	one	spot	in	the	world	where	we’d	be	safe	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">grow	into	knowing	one	another,	caring	for	one	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	again	I	couldn’t	help	wondering	if	this	was	somehow	the	doing	of	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">guardian	angel,	the	voice.	Had	he	given	Jace	the	same	prompting	he’d	given	me? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eyes	flickering	as	he	seemed	to	study	my	face,	Jace	asked,	“What	is	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Did	 I	 dare	 mention	 the	 voice?	 We’d	 just	 opened	 up	 so	 much	 to	 each	 other; the	 last	 thing	 I	 wanted	 was	 for	 him	 to	 think	 I	 was	 crazy,	 or	 at	 least	 slightly unbalanced	 by	 everything	 I’d	 experienced	 since	 the	 Heat	 stole	 everything	 I loved.	But	I	didn’t	want	to	keep	it	a	secret	from	him,	either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you….”	I	began,	then	stopped.	He	was	still	holding	my	hands,	fingers</p>
<p class="calibre1">strong	and	somehow	comforting.	I	never	wanted	him	to	let	go,	although	I	knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’d	 have	 to	 at	 some	 point,	 just	 to	 let	 me	 get	 back	 to	 making	 dinner.	 But	 that could	 wait	 another	 minute	 or	 two.	 His	 gaze	 was	 still	 resting	 on	 my	 face, expectant,	 wondering	 what	 I	 was	 trying	 to	 ask.	 And	 there	 was	 simply	 no	 good way	to	ask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	 you	 ever	 hear	 anything?”	 I	 blurted.	 “Afterward,	 I	 mean.	 Like	 a	 voice guiding	you,	telling	you	where	you	should	go.	Telling	you	should	come	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	long,	long	pause.	At	least	he	hadn’t	let	go	of	my	hands,	but	I	could	see	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">weighing	 the	 question	 in	 his	 mind,	 trying	 to	 see	 if	 I	 was	 serious.	 “No,	 nothing like	that,”	he	said	at	last.	“Like	I	said,	I	came	to	Santa	Fe	because	no	one	seemed to	be	left	in	Taos,	and	I	had	a	friend	here.	The	world’s	longest	shot,	I	know.”	He hesitated,	then	asked,	his	tone	soft,	“Did	you	hear	something	like	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>I	 wanted	 to	 deny	 it.	 But	 that	 would	 also	 seem	 like	 a	 denial	 of	 all	 the assistance	 the	 voice…guardian	 angel…whatever…had	 given	 me.	 “Yes,”	 I	 said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	how	I	found	this	house.	I	would	never	have	gotten	out	of	Albuquerque	alive</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	not	for	the	voice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘The	voice,’”	he	repeated.	Nothing	in	the	calm,	even	set	of	his	features	told</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	 what	 he	 was	 thinking,	 and	 so	 I	 could	 only	 stand	 there	 in	 agony,	 wondering when	 he	 was	 going	 to	 let	 go	 and	 back	 away	 from	 me.	 Away	 from	 the	 crazy woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow	I	managed	to	stand	there,	waiting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	been	blessed,	I	think,”	Jace	said	at	last.	“Some	guiding	spirit	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	on	you	and	knew	you	were	worthy,	that	you	needed	to	survive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Relief	washed	over	me.	So	he	didn’t	think	I	was	crazy.	Then	again,	although</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	 never	 much	 believed	 in	 such	 things,	 I	 guessed	 that	 his	 people	 thought differently.	The	dividing	line	between	our	world	and	the	world	of	the	spirits	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">definitely	thinner	for	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	really	think	that?”	I	asked,	my	voice	barely	above	a	whisper.	Up	until</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	moment,	I	hadn’t	realized	how	important	it	was	that	he	believed	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 yes,”	 he	 replied,	 pulling	 me	 closer	 to	 him,	 his	 lips	 finding	 mine.	 “So let’s	make	sure	our	survival	matters.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a><img src="index-155_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>

<p class="calibre1">FOURTEEN</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dinner	 was…well,	 dinner	 was	 wonderful.	 It	 might	 have	 only	 been	 left-over sausage	 and	 sauce	 out	 of	 a	 jar,	 leavened	 a	 little	 by	 some	 zucchini	 from	 the greenhouse	 that	 I	 steamed	 to	 go	 along	 with	 the	 pasta,	 but	 I	 might	 as	 well	 have been	 eating	 at	 a	 five-star	 restaurant	 for	 as	 exhilarated	 as	 I	 felt.	 Jace	 had	 kissed me.	 Jace	 wanted	 me,	 had	 only	 been	 holding	 back	 because	 he	 didn’t	 want	 to pressure	me	or	frighten	me	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	people	might	have	said	it	was	inevitable,	that	if	you	put	two	healthy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">attractive	 people	 of	 the	 same	 sexual	 orientation	 in	 the	 same	 place,	 sharing	 the same	 home,	 eventually	 they’d	 end	 up	 together.	 Propinquity,	 or	 whatever	 they called	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 didn’t	 believe	 that	 for	 a	 second,	 though.	 There	 were	 plenty	 of	 guys	 I’d known	over	the	years	who,	if	they’d	shown	up	on	my	doorstep	the	way	Jace	had, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could’ve	lived	in	platonic	harmony	with	and	never	had	the	slightest	inclination</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	anything	more	than	a	quick	hug	on	a	birthday	or	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace,	 on	 the	 other	 hand…well,	 I’d	 been	 thinking	 how	 hot	 he	 was	 from	 the first	moment	I	laid	eyes	on	him,	even	as	I	was	confronting	him	at	the	gate	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">compound,	 shotgun	 in	 hand.	 That	 sudden,	 unexpected	 flare	 of	 admiration	 had shifted	into	attraction	as	the	days	had	gone	on,	and	now	was…what? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Far	more	than	simple	attraction,	even	if	I	was	too	scared	to	put	a	label	on	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">right	then. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>He’d	opened	a	bottle	of	wine,	some	more	of	the	Black	Mesa	Montepulciano, which,	as	it	turned	out,	was	also	a	New	Mexico	wine.	I’d	been	so	rattled	when	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrived	at	the	compound	that	I	hadn’t	even	read	the	label	that	closely.	It	did	go</p>
<p class="calibre1">well	 with	 the	 simple	 meal	 I’d	 prepared.	 More	 than	 that,	 it	 gave	 the	 evening	 a sense	of	celebration,	that	this	was	just	the	beginning	of	something	far	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Was	I	ready	for	that?	Yes,	I’d	been	dutifully	taking	my	pill	every	night,	knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	 be	 protected	 in	 that	 way,	 if	 nothing	 else.	 Maybe	 I	 should’ve	 been	 worrying whether	 Jace	 had	 packed	 some	 condoms	 as	 part	 of	 his	 “surviving	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">apocalypse”	 kit,	 but	 for	 some	 reason,	 I	 didn’t	 think	 that	 was	 necessary.	 He certainly	didn’t	give	off	the	man-whore	vibe.	It	should	be	fine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dollar	for	your	thoughts,”	Jace	said,	and	I	startled,	knowing	I	could	never</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell	 him	 I’d	 been	 pondering	 contraceptive	 options.	 By	 then	 we	 were	 winding down,	only	a	few	bites	left	on	our	plates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	whole	dollar?”	I	teased,	glad	that	we	were	eating	by	candlelight.	With	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">luck,	he	wouldn’t	have	noticed	the	way	the	hot	blood	rose	to	my	cheeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	a	penny’s	probably	worth	more	than	a	dollar	now,	since	at	least	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	melt	a	penny	down	and	get	the	copper	out	of	it.”	He	set	down	his	fork	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaned	forward	slightly,	a	smile	touching	those	full	lips,	the	ones	that	had	felt	so delicious	when	pressed	against	mine.	“But	your	choice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	—	I	wasn’t	thinking	about	anything	in	particular,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	eyebrow	went	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seriously.”	I	lifted	my	glass	of	wine	and	took	a	quick	swallow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	eyebrow	went	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh,	boy.	I	could	stall	and	I	could	hedge,	but	it	was	pretty	obvious	that	Jace</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 see	 through	 any	 of	 those	 machinations.	 “Okay,	 fine,”	 I	 told	 him,	 setting my	 wine	 glass	 back	 down	 and	 taking	 a	 breath.	 “If	 you	 have	 to	 know,	 I	 was thinking	 about	 whether	 you’d	 packed	 any	 condoms	 when	 you	 bailed	 out	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Taos.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 let	 out	 a	 breath,	 both	 eyebrows	 still	 raised.	 “You	 don’t	 beat	 around	 the bush,	do	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	you	 <i class="calibre3">asked</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	second	or	two,	he	didn’t	say	anything,	only	looked	at	me.	I	tried	not	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">blink	or	glance	away,	but	damn,	that	was	hard.	My	cheeks	felt	like	they	were	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	last	he	said,	“No,	I	didn’t.	Sorry…I	guess	I	was	thinking	more	about	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world	 ending	 or	 something	 than	 whether	 I	 was	 going	 to	 get	 laid	 in	 the	 near future.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	winced,	and	he	shook	his	head	as	if	exasperated	with	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jessica,	 I’m	 sorry.	 That’s	 not	 what	 I	 meant.”	 His	 hands	 flattened	 on	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a>tabletop,	as	if	by	exerting	pressure	against	the	cool	copper	surface,	he	could	take back	what	he’d	just	said.	“That	is,	if	we	—	if	we	were	together,	I	think	you	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	would	be	a	lot	more	than	just	getting	laid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	heart	seemed	to	start	beating	again.	“It	would?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	it	would,”	he	said,	his	tone	quiet,	but	no	less	intense	for	all	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	smiled	at	him.	“It’s	fine.	I’m	on	the	pill.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 that…well,	 I’m	 still	 not	 sure	 who	 moved	 first,	 but	 almost	 in	 a	 single motion,	 we	 were	 on	 our	 feet,	 pushing	 our	 chairs	 away	 from	 the	 table,	 Jace reaching	 out	 to	 take	 me	 by	 the	 hand.	 He	 pulled	 me	 into	 him,	 kissing	 me,	 his mouth	sweet	with	wine.	I	felt	as	if	I	could	never	get	enough	of	tasting	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 he	 broke	 the	 kiss	 after	 a	 few	 seconds,	 leading	 me	 down	 the	 hallway	 to my	 bedroom.	 He’d	 never	 been	 in	 here	 before,	 of	 course,	 although	 I	 left	 it unlocked	most	of	the	time,	except	for	the	occasions	when	I	was	getting	dressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	 Dutchie	 liked	 to	 wander	 between	 our	 rooms	 at	 night,	 I	 didn’t	 have	 the heart	 to	 shut	 the	 door.	 Because	 of	 that,	 though,	 I	 always	 kept	 it	 tidy.	 I	 knew	 I didn’t	have	to	worry	about	Jace	tripping	over	a	discarded	bra	or	something	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	entered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	cold,	though,	away	from	the	fireplace	in	the	family	room,	which	did	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">pretty	good	job	of	heating	the	dining	room	as	well,	since	they	were	right	next	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">each	 other.	 Jace	 let	 go	 of	 my	 hand	 —	 with	 some	 reluctance,	 it	 seemed	 —	 and asked,	“Okay	if	I	get	a	fire	going?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 already	 have,”	 I	 said,	 smiling,	 but	 I	 nodded.	 “We	 could	 use	 one.	 It’s probably	going	to	get	below	freezing	tonight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	went	to	the	fireplace	and	began	expertly	stacking	some	logs	within	it.	We</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	burning	a	lot	already,	but	I	wasn’t	too	worried.	The	house	had	an	enormous</p>
<p class="calibre1">log	 room	 built	 on	 the	 north	 side,	 with	 wood	 stacked	 almost	 to	 the	 rafters	 on every	wall.	Jace	had	taken	one	look	at	the	stockpile	and	said	we	could	have	fires</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	every	room	through	July	if	necessary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 I	 allowed	 myself	 to	 enjoy	 the	 warmth	 that	 began	 to	 spread	 through	 the room	after	he	got	the	fire	going,	and	not	fret	over	whether	we	were	going	to	run</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	of	wood	halfway	through	the	winter.	And	I’d	be	lying	if	I	said	I	didn’t	also</p>
<p class="calibre1">enjoy	 watching	 the	 way	 Jace’s	 jeans	 hugged	 his	 backside	 as	 he	 bent	 over, coaxing	the	fire	to	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Afterward,	he	turned	around,	then	came	over	to	me	where	I	sat	on	the	foot	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	bed.	“Better?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	 I	 replied.	 “Although	 it’ll	 probably	 still	 be	 smart	 to	 get	 under	 those covers	quickly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	help	with	that.”	His	fingers	tugged	my	shirt	loose	from	the	waistband</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	my	jeans,	then	undid	my	belt	buckle.	At	the	same	time,	I	was	working	at	his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>belt	as	well	before	undoing	the	buttons	on	his	faded	Levi’s.	I	hooked	my	thumbs through	the	belt	loops	of	his	pants,	easing	them	down.	I	could	tell	he	was	already aroused,	the	bulge	in	the	dark	gray	boxer-briefs	he	wore	evidence	that	stopping</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	get	the	fire	going	hadn’t	put	him	too	much	off	his	stride,	so	to	speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stepped	out	of	the	jeans	but	didn’t	let	that	distract	him	from	pulling	my	T-</p>
<p class="calibre1">shirt	 up	 and	 over	 my	 head.	 After	 dropping	 it	 on	 top	 of	 his	 jeans,	 he	 reached down	and	undid	the	front	clasp	of	my	bra,	releasing	a	long,	drawn-out	breath	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	hands	closed	over	my	bare	breasts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 gasped,	 closing	 my	 eyes	 as	 he	 caressed	 me,	 fingers	 sliding	 over	 my	 skin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	was	tugging	at	my	jeans,	getting	them	out	of	the	way,	and	I	stepped	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	them,	letting	him	lead	me	over	to	the	bed.	With	one	hand,	he	yanked	back	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">covers,	 and	 I	 collapsed	 onto	 the	 mattress,	 bringing	 him	 with	 me,	 bare	 skin	 to bare	 skin,	 our	 mouths	 finding	 one	 another	 in	 the	 fire-lit	 darkness.	 The	 sheets were	icy	cold,	but	I	hardly	noticed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because	 oh,	 God,	 he	 was	 reaching	 between	 my	 legs,	 stroking	 me	 as	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mouth	closed	on	my	nipple.	My	heart	was	pounding,	my	breath	coming	in	great, </p>
<p class="calibre1">heaving	gasps.	I	had	done	all	these	things	before,	but	never	with	Jace.	And	it	had never	felt	like	this	with	anyone	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	own	hand	moved	lower,	touching	him,	wrapping	around	him,	feeling	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">heat	 and	 the	 strength	 of	 his	 arousal.	 He	 moaned	 as	 I	 touched	 him,	 the	 sound seeming	to	reverberate	through	every	inch	of	my	body.	Or	maybe	it	was	just	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">approaching	wave	of	the	orgasm	that	I	could	feel	bearing	down	on	me,	building</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	until	I	couldn’t	do	anything	except	allow	Jace	to	touch	me,	to	flick	his	tongue against	 the	 bud	 of	 my	 breast,	 and	 then	 it	 tore	 through	 me	 like	 a	 swollen	 river breaking	down	a	dam,	my	voice	calling	his	name,	my	body	heaving	against	his. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes,	it	had	been	a	while,	but	it	was	more	than	that.	It	was	Jace,	all	of	it	—	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	he’d	made	me	come,	the	way	I	felt	as	if	I	had	been	some	strange	half-alive</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	before	this,	hiding	in	the	darkness	until	he	brought	me	into	the	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 he	 was	 shifting,	 moving,	 and	 I	 could	 feel	 him	 pushing	 against	 me, against	my	entrance.	I’d	never	wanted	anything	more	than	I	wanted	him	inside</p>
<p class="calibre1">me,	filling	me.	“Please,	Jace,”	I	breathed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	all	he	needed.	In	that	instant,	he	was	there,	in	me,	moving	deeper</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 deeper	 as	 I	 rocked	 my	 hips	 against	 his,	 drawing	 him	 into	 me,	 our	 bodies locked	 together,	 finding	 the	 rhythm,	 the	 perfect	 push	 and	 pull	 of	 man	 and woman,	 Jace	 and	 me.	 I	 clung	 to	 him,	 one	 hand	 moving	 up	 to	 clutch	 his	 neck, feeling	 the	 leather	 cord	 that	 held	 his	 hair	 back.	 One	 tug,	 and	 it	 was	 loose,	 his raven	hair	spilling	over	his	shoulders,	brushing	against	my	cheek,	and	that	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">it,	 the	 last	 push	 I	 needed.	 Crying	 out,	 calling	 his	 name,	 gasping,	 my	 body convulsing	against	his,	and	then	I	could	feel	him	let	loose,	heard	him	groan,	his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a>hips	driving	him	into	me,	my	legs	wrapped	around	him,	until	finally	he	stilled, went	quiet,	his	mouth	by	my	ear,	my	name	a	soft	breath	in	the	silent	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jessica….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	lay	there	for	uncounted	moments,	flesh	to	flesh,	drinking	in	each	other’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">warmth.	 Finally,	 he	 shifted,	 pulling	 away	 from	 me,	 but	 only	 so	 he	 could	 lie	 on his	 side,	 his	 chest	 touching	 my	 arm,	 as	 if	 he	 didn’t	 want	 any	 real	 distance	 to come	between	us.	I	understood	the	feeling	all	too	well.	In	a	moment,	I’d	have	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">force	myself	out	of	bed	and	go	to	the	bathroom,	get	myself	cleaned	up,	but	right</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	I	only	wanted	to	be	next	to	him,	to	breathe	him	in,	to	reassure	myself	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	truly	was	real,	that	this	actually	had	happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 reached	 out	 and	 pushed	 a	 strand	 of	 hair	 away	 from	 my	 face.	 Such	 a tender	 gesture,	 so	 different	 from	 the	 wild	 abandon	 of	 a	 few	 minutes	 earlier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because	the	room	was	so	dimly	lit,	I	couldn’t	precisely	decipher	his	expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	definitely	wasn’t	expecting	what	came	next. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	love	you,	Jessica.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Out	of	nowhere.	Or	not	nowhere,	not	really.	I	could	have	seen	those	words	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	way	he	looked	at	me	when	he	thought	I	wouldn’t	notice,	in	how	careful	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 to	 listen	 to	 my	 suggestions…in	 the	 very	 reticence	 that	 had	 kept	 him	 from making	a	move	until	he	was	certain	it	wouldn’t	be	rebuffed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 because	 he’d	 been	 brave	 enough	 to	 say	 it	 first,	 I	 didn’t	 hesitate.	 Not now.	I’d	been	denying	this	to	myself,	coming	up	with	reasons	why	it	couldn’t	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">true,	but	there	was	no	point	in	denying	it	any	longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	love	you,	Jace.”	It	was	true.	I	knew	it,	accepted	it,	let	my	heart	and	mind</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	soul	become	open	to	the	idea.	I	loved	Jason	Little	River.	The	sound	of	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice.	 The	 crinkle	 at	 the	 corner	 of	 his	 eyes	 when	 he	 laughed.	 The	 long,	 strong fingers	of	his	hands.	The	way	he	asked	for	my	opinion	on	things	and	never	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	 feel	 foolish	 for	 not	 knowing	 as	 much	 as	 he	 did	 about	 raising	 animals	 or gardening	 or…well,	 most	 things.	 I’d	 led	 a	 sheltered	 life,	 while	 I	 got	 the impression	 he	 hadn’t.	 His	 hands	 were	 beautiful,	 but	 they	 had	 the	 calluses	 and scars	of	someone	who	hadn’t	spent	his	entire	life	behind	a	desk.	I	supposed	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	from	the	time	he	spent	at	the	pueblo,	even	though	his	own	start-up	business</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	involved	computers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	these	details	and	contradictions,	all	the	elements	that	made	Jace	uniquely</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace…they	 were	 what	 made	 me	 realize	 I	 loved	 him.	 And,	 by	 some	 miracle,	 he loved	me	in	return. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pulled	me	against	him,	and	I	burrowed	my	face	into	his	chest,	breathing</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	warm,	delicious	scent	of	his	skin,	hearing	his	heart	beat,	strong	and	sure.	I couldn’t	remember	a	time	when	I’d	been	this	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Happy.	Was	I	allowed	to	be	happy,	when	most	of	the	world	was	gone? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>I	didn’t	know.	I	tried	to	tell	myself	that	my	parents	would	have	wanted	me	to be	happy,	that	they	wouldn’t	have	wanted	me	to	wallow	in	sorrow	for	the	rest	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 days,	 just	 because	 they	 were	 gone.	 But	 even	 in	 the	 warm	 afterglow	 of	 our lovemaking,	 of	 hearing	 Jace	 say	 that	 he	 loved	 me,	 I	 couldn’t	 help	 feeling	 a twinge	of	guilt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 pushed	 a	 lock	 of	 hair	 away	 from	 my	 face,	 trailed	 his	 fingers	 across	 my cheek	 and	 down	 to	 my	 mouth.	 I	 pressed	 my	 lips	 very	 softly	 against	 his forefinger,	 and	 he	 smiled.	 But	 then	 his	 expression	 sobered,	 and	 he	 gave	 me	 a very	direct	look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	do	this	to	yourself,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	what?”	But	I	was	pretty	sure	what	he	meant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 can’t	 beat	 yourself	 up	 just	 because	 you’ve	 found	 some	 happiness	 in your	life.	The	Dying	wasn’t	your	fault.	All	you	can	do	is	live	your	life	to	the	best of	your	ability,	make	your	survival	mean	something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The	Dying</i>.	It	was	the	first	time	I’d	heard	him	use	that	phrase,	but	it	was	apt enough.	 Because	 that	 was	 what	 had	 irrevocably	 changed	 the	 world…	 all	 that death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,”	I	whispered.	“It’s	just	sometimes…it	comes	rushing	over	me	like	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">wave,	you	know?	I	put	it	aside,	and	I’m	fine,	because	I’m	here	with	you,	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">know	we’re	safe,	but….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	arms	went	around	me,	keeping	me	close	to	him,	close	to	the	security	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	strongly	beating	heart	and	the	soothing	warmth	of	his	flesh.	“I	know.”	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">words	 came	 in	 a	 murmur,	 gentle.	 “You’re	 stronger	 than	 you	 know,	 Jessica.	 It’s human	to	feel	doubt	and	worry.	But…don’t	let	it	get	between	us.	Please?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 a	 note	 of	 concern	 in	 his	 voice	 that	 I	 hadn’t	 heard	 before,	 and	 I shifted	so	I	could	look	up	into	his	eyes.	“Oh,	no,”	I	told	him	then.	“I’ll	never	let anything	come	between	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 slept	 in	 each	 other’s	 arms	 that	 night,	 and	 awoke	 to	 a	 chilly	 morning	 where the	roof	of	the	garage	was	white	with	frost.	The	fire	had	guttered	down	to	coals, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	Jace	wrapped	one	of	the	blankets	around	himself	as	he	got	up	to	set	new	logs</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	hearth	and	get	a	fresh	blaze	going.	Dutchie	watched	all	this	with	approval; it	looked	as	if	she	hadn’t	moved	since	she	curled	up	in	front	of	the	fireplace	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>night	 before.	 I	 got	 the	 distinct	 impression	 that	 she	 was	 happy	 with	 our	 new sleeping	 arrangements,	 since	 it	 meant	 she	 wouldn’t	 have	 to	 split	 her	 time between	Jace’s	and	my	room	anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	with	the	fire	going,	I	was	loath	to	get	out	of	bed.	But	I	wasn’t	a	city	girl</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	longer;	I	needed	to	get	moving,	shower,	check	on	the	goats,	start	breakfast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 these	 things	 were	 speeded	 up	 by	 Jace	 and	 me	 sharing	 the	 shower	 in	 the master	bath,	which	was	roomy	enough	that	we	fit	quite	nicely.	Okay,	we	didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">save	quite	as	much	time	as	I’d	thought,	because	we	got	lost	in	lathering	up	each</p>
<p class="calibre1">other’s	 bodies,	 running	 soapy	 hands	 over	 bare	 skin,	 until	 I	 was	 pressed	 up against	 the	 wall	 and	 he	 was	 inside	 me	 again,	 one	 of	 my	 legs	 wrapped	 around him,	holding	him	in	place	while	he	thrust	into	me.	We	had	to	clean	up	all	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">again	afterward,	but	it	was	worth	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 last,	 though,	 we	 got	 out	 of	 the	 shower	 —	 mostly	 because	 the	 hot	 water heater	began	to	run	out	of	steam	—	and	got	dressed,	then	dried	our	hair.	A	pang</p>
<p class="calibre1">went	through	me	as	he	fished	another	one	of	those	leather	cords	out	of	his	pocket</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	began	winding	it	around	his	hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t,”	I	said,	and	he	turned	toward	me	with	a	quizzical	look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	tie	it	up.	I	like	it	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	slow	smile	spread	over	his	lips	then,	and	he	shrugged	and	shoved	the	cord</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	into	the	pocket	of	his	jeans.	“Okay.	But	if	it	starts	getting	in	my	face	when I’m	out	in	the	wind	—	” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	okay,	you	can	tie	it	back	again.”	I	went	to	him	and	gave	him	a	quick</p>
<p class="calibre1">kiss	on	the	cheek.	“I’m	not	totally	unreasonable,	you	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 I	 know.”	 He	 gave	 my	 own	 ponytail	 the	 side-eye,	 and	 I	 couldn’t	 help laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	do	as	I	say	and	all	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 went	 out	 to	 check	 on	 the	 goats	 before	 breakfast,	 our	 breath	 puffing	 up into	the	icy	air.	They	seemed	all	right,	but	Jace	looked	at	the	frost	on	the	ground and	shook	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	need	to	get	them	some	kind	of	protection	from	the	cold.	It’s	only	going</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	get	worse	after	this,	and	when	we	have	our	first	snowfall….”	He	didn’t	bother</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 finish	 the	 sentence,	 but	 I	 knew	 what	 he	 meant.	 Our	 little	 herd	 needed someplace	to	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	 what	 are	 you	 thinking?”	 I	 asked,	 looking	 around	 the	 walled-in</p>
<p class="calibre1">landscape.	 From	 within	 the	 chicken	 coop,	 I	 could	 hear	 the	 hens	 clucking	 away happily.	It	was	obvious	they	hadn’t	suffered	too	much	from	the	cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 doesn’t	 need	 to	 be	 fancy,	 but	 some	 kind	 of	 shed,	 someplace	 where	 they can	go	inside	if	they	need	to.	The	henhouse	went	together	pretty	quickly,	so	I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>sure	I	can	do	something	like	that	for	the	goats,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	saw	another	foray	to	Home	Depot	in	our	near	future.	We’d	stocked	up	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">food	just	the	day	before,	but	if	we	were	going	to	Santa	Fe	anyway,	I	was	going</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 put	 in	 a	 request	 to	 raid	 an	 outdoor	 gear	 store	 or	 something	 similar.	 My outerwear	 definitely	 wasn’t	 up	 to	 snuff,	 and	 I	 had	 a	 feeling	 that	 adding	 some thermal	underwear	to	my	repertoire	wouldn’t	be	a	bad	idea,	either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 I	 asked	 about	 that,	 and	 Jace	 nodded.	 “I	 could	 use	 a	 few	 things,	 too.	 So we’ll	 do	 that	 first,	 and	 then	 we’ll	 go	 the	 hardware	 store.	 I	 need	 to	 check	 the library	 here,	 though	 —	 I’m	 pretty	 sure	 I	 saw	 a	 book	 with	 plans	 for	 different kinds	of	outbuildings,	and	that’ll	help	me	figure	out	how	much	to	bring	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	that	settled,	he	headed	back	into	the	house	to	start	making	notes,	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">popped	into	the	henhouse	to	scoop	up	some	fresh	eggs	for	breakfast,	then	hurried</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 kitchen.	 At	 least	 in	 there	 it	 was	 relatively	 warm	 and	 cheery.	 My	 fingers gradually	 thawed	 out	 as	 I	 made	 scrambled	 eggs	 and	 toast,	 and	 a	 pot	 of	 fresh coffee.	I	reflected	then	that	Jace	was	right	—	I	couldn’t	let	survivor’s	guilt	get	in the	way	of	enjoying	the	life	I	had	now.	I	had	him,	and	we	had	this	beautiful	place to	 live,	 with	 plenty	 of	 food	 and	 no	 one	 bothering	 us.	 In	 this	 post-Dying	 world, that	was	about	as	close	to	heaven	as	I	would	probably	get. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 breakfast,	 we	 patted	 Dutchie	 and	 went	 out	 to	 the	 garage.	 I’d	 been thinking	this	over	while	Jace	took	care	of	this	dishes,	and	I	realized	it	was	time for	me	to	show	how	much	I	really	did	trust	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait,”	 I	 said	 as	 he	 began	 to	 head	 to	 the	 passenger	 side	 of	 the	 Jeep.	 He glanced	back	toward	me,	and	I	opened	my	hand	to	reveal	the	key	fob	lying	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	palm.	“You	want	to	drive?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	dark	eyes	lit	up,	but	he	didn’t	move.	“Are	you	sure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded,	and	he	came	back	to	me,	taking	the	key	from	my	hand	as	he	leaned</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	to	kiss	me.	Mmm,	coffee	and	the	faintest	trace	of	butter,	rich	and	friendly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">welcoming,	just	like	the	man	who	was	kissing	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,”	he	said,	then	went	to	climb	in	the	driver-side	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 felt	 strange	 to	 go	 around	 to	 the	 passenger	 side,	 to	 get	 in	 and	 then	 watch Jace	 back	 the	 Cherokee	 out	 of	 the	 garage	 and	 maneuver	 it	 down	 the	 steeply sloping	 drive	 to	 the	 gate.	 I	 had	 a	 new	 perspective	 on	 things	 this	 way,	 could concentrate	on	my	surroundings	rather	than	merely	on	the	road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	that	there	was	a	lot	to	look	at	up	here.	The	junipers	didn’t	change	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	seasons,	and	the	grass	had	already	been	sere	and	yellow	even	before	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">frost	hit.	But	the	sky	was	a	deep,	deep	blue,	overlaid	with	faint	traceries	of	high clouds,	 and	 in	 the	 Sangre	 de	 Cristo	 mountains	 above	 town,	 I	 could	 see	 the patches	of	bright	yellow	aspens	now	looking	faded	as	they	lost	more	and	more	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	leaves,	settling	in	for	winter. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a>We	 came	 down	 onto	 Upper	 Canyon	 road	 and	 wended	 our	 way	 into	 town. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Any	ideas	on	outdoor	supply	places?”	Jace	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	really,”	I	admitted.	“When	I	came	here	with	my	friends,	we	were	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">interested	in	partying	than	hiking.	And	of	course	you	can’t	Yelp	something	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	apocalypse.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	mouth	seemed	to	twitch,	but	when	he	turned	slightly	to	look	at	me,	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">expression	was	grim	enough.	“Is	that	what	you	think	this	is?	The	apocalypse?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	close	enough	as	makes	no	difference.”	We’d	slowed	to	maybe	twenty</p>
<p class="calibre1">miles	 an	 hour	 at	 the	 most,	 partly	 because	 Jace	 was	 weaving	 in	 and	 out	 of	 the abandoned	cars	on	the	streets,	but	also	because	I	had	a	feeling	he	didn’t	have	any idea	where	he	was	supposed	to	go.	“I	mean,	most	of	the	world	is	dead,	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">life	 we	 had	 back	 then	 is	 gone.	 No,	 I	 suppose	 there	 weren’t	 any	 four	 horsemen and	blood-red	moons	and	flaming	swords	and	all	that,	but….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	didn’t	reply,	but	I	could	almost	feel	him	turning	over	the	idea	in	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 knowledge	 of	 Native	 American	 mythology	 was	 scanty	 at	 best,	 and	 so	 I didn’t	 know	 if	 his	 people	 had	 their	 own	 vision	 of	 the	 end	 of	 the	 world.	 The terminology	I’d	used	was	purely	Revelations	sort	of	stuff,	but	that	was	my	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">frame	 of	 reference.	 At	 least,	 those	 were	 the	 kinds	 of	 things	 you’d	 always	 hear quoted	in	movies	dealing	with	the	end	times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	an	idea,”	he	said,	in	a	very	different	tone.	“Let’s	stop	and	go	into	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">hotel.	They	had	to	have	phone	books	and	local	directories	at	the	concierge	desk, </p>
<p class="calibre1">right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 had	 a	 point.	 I	 couldn’t	 remember	 the	 last	 time	 I’d	 used	 a	 phone	 book, since	I	either	used	Yelp	or	Google	Maps	to	find	things	with	my	cell	phone,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">maybe	not	everyone	was	as	firmly	rooted	in	the	digital	age	as	I	had	been	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	world	collapsed.	Checking	at	the	hotel	sounded	like	a	good	idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	he	pulled	up	onto	the	sidewalk	in	front	of	the	La	Fonda	Hotel,	in	a	spot</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	 once	 bellhops	 had	 probably	 assisted	 people	 with	 their	 luggage	 but	 was now	 free	 of	 cars.	 And	 actually,	 as	 I	 got	 out	 of	 the	 Jeep	 and	 looked	 around quickly,	it	somehow	seemed	as	if	the	street	wasn’t	quite	as	choked	with	vehicles</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	I	remembered	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	the	matter?”	Jace	asked,	seeming	to	notice	the	way	I	was	scanning</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	street.	“Do	you	see	something?”	His	hand	went	to	his	belt,	and	for	the	first</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	I	realized	he	was	wearing	his	long	knife	in	its	sheath.	I	hadn’t	even	thought to	 bring	 one	 of	 the	 guns	 with	 me.	 Maybe	 Jace	 made	 me	 feel	 a	 little	  <i class="calibre3">too</i>	 safe.	 I was	getting	sloppy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	 I	 replied,	 quickly	 so	 he	 wouldn’t	 get	 too	 nervous.	 “That	 is…I	 could have	 sworn	 there	 were	 more	 cars	 here	 the	 last	 time	 I	 drove	 through.	 It’s	 as	 if some	of	them	are	just…gone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a>His	 eyebrows	 went	 up,	 and	 I	 could	 see	 him	 look	 past	 me	 to	 the	 street	 the hotel	faced.	What	good	that	would	do,	I	wasn’t	sure,	because	I	didn’t	think	he’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">even	come	this	way	when	he	passed	through	town.	There	were	obvious	gaps	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	lines	of	cars	parked	at	the	sidewalk,	but	that	didn’t	have	to	mean	anything, </p>
<p class="calibre1">except	that	no	one	had	been	parked	there	in	the	first	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	sure?”	he	asked,	and	now	I	thought	I	detected	a	note	of	patience	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	voice,	as	if	he	was	trying	to	humor	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 I’m	 not	 sure,	 because	 I	 wasn’t	 memorizing	 everything	 I	 saw	 when	 I drove	through	here.	It	just	feels…off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 all	 the	 more	 reason	 for	 us	 to	 see	 if	 we	 can	 find	 a	 phone	 book	 and	 a map,	and	then	get	out	of	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	decided	I	couldn’t	argue	with	that	logic,	and	followed	him	into	the	lobby	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	hotel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Luckily	 for	 us,	 the	 concierge’s	 desk	 did	 have	 an	 area	 phone	 book,	 as	 well	 as	 a detailed	map	of	downtown	and	a	larger	one	for	the	greater	Santa	Fe	area.	I	took	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">quick	glance	around,	remembering	how	Tori	and	Elena	and	I	had	gone	up	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rooftop	bar	for	drinks.	Back	then	the	place	had	been	packed.	Now	the	tiled	floors</p>
<p class="calibre1">echoed	under	our	footsteps,	and	I	had	to	work	hard	not	to	look	at	the	flurries	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">gray	 ash	 that	 stray	 drafts	 must	 have	 blown	 against	 the	 floorboards	 and	 into	 the corners. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	felt	good	to	be	out	in	the	sun	again,	despite	the	brisk	wind,	although	we	got</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	 the	 Jeep	 quickly	 enough.	 I	 paged	 through	 the	 phone	 book	 and	 discovered that	there	was	an	REI	probably	less	than	five	minutes	from	our	current	location. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace	 seemed	 cheered	 by	 that,	 and	 we	 headed	 there	 in	 silence,	 although	 I	 kept looking	 at	 the	 streets	 as	 they	 passed	 by,	 trying	 to	 determine	 if	 they	 felt	 less impacted	by	abandoned	vehicles	than	I’d	previously	thought.	It	was	hard	to	say</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 sure,	 as	 I’d	 never	 gone	 down	 this	 particular	 road.	 It	 did	 seem	 less	 crowded than	it	should	be,	although	I	was	basing	that	observation	on	pure	gut	feeling	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	much	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 store	 was	 located	 almost	 on	 the	 railroad	 tracks,	 just	 off	 Market	 Street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	 there	 were	 a	 few	 vehicles	 parked	 nearby,	 the	 place	 still	 felt	 far	 more deserted	 than	 some	 of	 the	 other	 shops	 I’d	 visited.	 Again,	 people	 probably</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a>weren’t	thinking	of	outdoor	supplies	as	they	were	succumbing	one	by	one	to	the Heat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace	 and	 I	 got	 out	 of	 the	 Jeep	 and	 headed	 to	 the	 store	 entrance.	 The	 glass wasn’t	 smashed,	 but	 the	 doors	 seemed	 to	 have	 gotten	 stuck	 halfway	 open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Convenient,	since	we	wouldn’t	have	to	worry	about	breaking	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 we	 entered	 the	 store,	 though,	 I	 still	 got	 the	 feeling	 that	 it	 had	 been carefully	 ransacked,	 although	 it	 wasn’t	 a	 mess.	 No,	 it	 was	 more	 that	 the	 stock seemed	far	leaner	than	it	should	have	been.	The	glass	case	with	the	GPS	devices</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 been	 emptied	 of	 its	 contents,	 and	 it	 looked	 as	 if	 a	 bunch	 of	 the	 mountain bikes	were	gone,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 at	 least	 the	 low-dollar	 stuff	 like	 the	 thermal	 underwear	 and	 the	 gloves hadn’t	been	totally	depleted.	I	got	a	shopping	cart	and	started	adding	anything	in my	size,	while	Jace	went	to	the	men’s	section	and	basically	did	the	same	thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	dumped	in	all	his	items,	then	went	back	for	a	thigh-length	down-filled	jacket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	he	put	it	in	the	cart,	he	looked	at	the	price	tag	and	shook	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	coat	cost	more	than	I	paid	for	my	motorcycle.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ouch.	Well,	retail	prices	were	definitely	a	thing	of	the	past,	so	it	wasn’t	as	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	had	to	worry	about	whether	we	could	afford	any	of	this	stuff.	“Yes,”	I	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“but	a	motorcycle	won’t	keep	you	warm	at	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	corner	of	his	mouth	quirked,	even	as	a	warm	gleam	came	and	went	in	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes.	“Oh,	I’ve	got	something	way	better	than	a	jacket	for	keeping	me	warm	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could	feel	heat	as	well,	running	through	my	core,	but	I	knew	we	needed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">stay	focused	on	the	task	at	hand.	“Anything	else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 about	 does	 it	 for	 me.	 I	 like	 my	 boots,	 so	 I’m	 not	 going	 to	 bother replacing	them.	You?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Same.”	Maybe	there	were	some	fancy	outdoor	shoes	that	would	have	suited</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	better,	but	my	hiking	boots	were	sturdy	and	comfortable.	They’d	cost	me	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	chunk	back	in	the	day	as	well,	come	to	think	of	it.	Money	well	spent,	as	far</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	I	was	concerned,	considering	everything	they’d	gotten	me	through	during	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">past	few	weeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 we	 pushed	 our	 haul	 out	 to	 the	 Cherokee	 and	 stowed	 everything	 in	 the back.	 “Who	 do	 you	 think	 took	 that	 other	 stuff?”	 I	 asked	 Jace,	 just	 as	 he	 was closing	the	hatch	to	the	cargo	area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shrugged.	“Other	survivors,	I	suppose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	 you	 think	 it’s	 weird	 that	 we	 still	 haven’t	 seen	 anyone?”	 Something felt	strange.	I	couldn’t	put	my	finger	on	it,	since	I	really	didn’t	have	any	frame	of reference	 for	 what	 things	 were	 supposed	 to	 feel	 like	 after	 the	 apocalypse.	 Still, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a>you’d	think	that	any	survivors	in	Santa	Fe	would	have	seen	Jace	and	me	coming and	 going,	 would	 have	 realized	 we	 didn’t	 pose	 any	 kind	 of	 threat.	 At	 least,	 I didn’t	think	we	looked	terribly	intimidating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.	Maybe.”	He	turned	the	key	over	in	his	hand,	fiddling	with	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	 bet	 if	 you	 crunched	 the	 numbers,	 you’d	 realize	 the	 odds	 of	 us	 running across	 any	 of	 the	 few	 hundred	 survivors	 in	 the	 area	 on	 any	 given	 day	 really aren’t	that	great.	We’d	have	to	keep	coming	down	here	day	after	day,	looking	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">them.	Are	you	ready	to	do	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Part	 of	 me	 was.	 Oh,	 I	 didn’t	 really	 need	 anyone	 other	 than	 Jace,	 and	 we’d done	just	fine	—	more	than	fine	—	on	our	own,	but	still…. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wanted	to	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,	I	could	tell	from	the	expression	Jace	currently	wore	that	he	didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">share	 this	 particular	 thirst	 for	 knowledge,	 and	 I	 decided	 I’d	 better	 not	 push	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 all,	 before	 I’d	 met	 him,	 my	 run-ins	 with	 survivors	 of	 the	 Dying	 hadn’t exactly	been	all	that	pleasant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	I	said,	and	gave	him	what	I	hoped	was	a	convincing	smile.	“I’ve	got</p>
<p class="calibre1">better	things	to	do	with	my	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a><img src="index-167_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="index-167_2.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">FIFTEEN</p>
<p class="calibre1">Strangely,	 although	 at	 first	 glance	 the	 Home	 Depot	 looked	 exactly	 the	 same	 as the	 last	 time	 we’d	 left	 it	 after	 we’d	 gotten	 the	 supplies	 for	 the	 chicken	 coop, when	 we	 went	 to	 fetch	 a	 trailer	 to	 haul	 the	 lumber	 home,	 only	 one	 was	 still sitting	there.	The	other	three	were	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 did	 take	 Jace	 aback;	 he	 stood	 there	 for	 a	 moment,	 hand	 on	 his	 chin, staring	at	the	spaces	where	the	trailers	had	been	parked.	Finally	he	said,	“What</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	hell?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	you’ll	admit	they’re	gone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	 course	 they’re	 gone.	 It’s	 kind	 of	 obvious,	 don’t	 you	 think?”	 Then	 he shook	his	head.	“Sorry,	Jess.	Didn’t	mean	to	snap	at	you.	But	this	is	just	weird.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 was	 a	 good	 word	 for	 it.	 I	 could	 see	 survivors	 making	 off	 with	 GPS</p>
<p class="calibre1">devices	and	hiking	boots	and	multi-packs	of	toilet	paper.	But	equipment	trailers? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	at	least	they	left	us	one,”	I	offered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	didn’t	seem	to	mollify	him	much.	He	stood	there,	hands	shoved	in	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">pockets,	clearly	discomfited	by	this	evidence	that	there	were	survivors,	and	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	seemed	to	be	organized	enough	to	make	off	with	most	of	the	store’s	trailers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	saw	the	troubled	glance	he	sent	toward	the	entrance	at	the	lumberyard	end	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	building,	and	guessed	he	was	worried	that	the	stock	inside	would	be	similarly</p>
<p class="calibre1">picked	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	were	here	now,	though,	so	we	might	as	well	go	in	and	see	what	we	could</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>find,	once	we	had	the	trailer	hooked	up	to	the	Cherokee.	That	didn’t	take	long, though,	and	afterward	we	headed	toward	the	building,	both	of	us	grimly	silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several	big	orange	flatbed	carts	sat	near	the	entrance,	so	Jace	took	one	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">wheeled	 it	 in,	 glass	 crunching	 underfoot	 as	 he	 did	 so.	 It	 seemed	 clear	 enough, even	from	a	quick	glance	around,	that	someone	had	been	in	here	since	our	last</p>
<p class="calibre1">visit.	The	battery	displays	were	almost	all	emptied	out,	and	a	lot	of	tools	seemed to	 be	 missing,	 too.	 But	 at	 least	 the	 lumberyard	 didn’t	 look	 as	 if	 it	 had	 been raided,	so	Jace	was	able	to	get	the	supplies	he	needed.	Tools	we	already	had	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	the	compound,	up	to	and	including	a	belt	sander	and	a	jigsaw,	so	the	looters</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	welcome	to	take	anything	that	still	remained	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wonder	what	they’re	doing	with	all	of	it,”	I	ventured	as	he	began	shifting</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	lumber	from	the	cart	and	into	the	trailer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	 knows?”	 he	 replied.	 “They’re	 probably	 people	 like	 us	 —	 you	 know, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 a	 place	 where	 they’re	 holed	 up	 and	 safe	 but	 still	 need	 assorted	 odds	 and ends.	Actually,	I	have	a	feeling	they	would	need	more,	since	our	compound	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	 well	 stocked	 when	 you	 found	 it.	 And	 you’re	 probably	 used	 to	 seeing	 stores getting	restocked	on	a	regular	basis.	Things	can	start	to	look	pretty	picked	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	no	one’s	coming	in	with	new	products	all	the	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	that	made	sense.	It	was	true	that	I	didn’t	have	much	experience	yet	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">world	where	stores	weren’t	magically	restocked	when	supplies	ran	low.	Even	so, </p>
<p class="calibre1">something	didn’t	feel	right	to	me.	Batteries	and	hammers	I	could	understand.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 trailers?	 I	 supposed	 if	 they	 had	 enough	 stuff	 to	 haul	 away,	 it	 made	 some sense.	But	that	would	have	to	be	a	 <i class="calibre3">lot</i>	of	stuff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace	finished	tying	down	the	lumber,	then	threw	the	nails	and	fasteners	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	 small	 items	 he’d	 collected	 into	 the	 cargo	 area	 of	 the	 Jeep.	 From	 the	 way the	corners	of	his	mouth	were	turned	down,	I	could	tell	he	wasn’t	thrilled	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">prospect	of	having	to	compete	with	other	survivors	for	supplies	we	might	need</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	get	through	the	winter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 no,	 that	 wouldn’t	 happen.	 We	 were	 stocked	 on	 food,	 and	 now	 we	 had milk	and	eggs	and	cheese	and	butter,	so	really,	once	we	got	the	goats	sheltered, </p>
<p class="calibre1">we	wouldn’t	have	much	need	to	come	back	down	to	Santa	Fe	proper	unless	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	just	dying	to.	And	I	didn’t	see	that	happening	anytime	soon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thinking	 about	 our	 goats	 made	 me	 recall	 the	 herd	 we’d	 taken	 them	 from. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	just	as	much	out	in	the	cold,	although	I	thought	I	remembered	seeing</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	few	ramshackle	outbuildings	on	the	property	where	they	were	grazing.	Still,	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t	hurt	to	check	on	them.	It	wasn’t	that	out	of	our	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I	mentioned	my	concerns	to	Jace,	he	nodded.	“That’s	probably	a	good</p>
<p class="calibre1">idea.	They	would	have	more	shelter	there	than	our	own	goats,	but	we	might	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">well	look.	If	they’re	in	trouble,	we	can	unload	this	stuff,	get	the	horse	trailer,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a>then	bring	them	back	to	the	compound.	It	might	take	a	couple	of	trips,	though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	said	I	wouldn’t	mind	that	at	all,	so	we	got	into	the	Cherokee	and	drove	off, </p>
<p class="calibre1">angling	away	from	our	normal	route	so	we	could	get	to	the	edge	of	town	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">small	ranch	where	we’d	first	found	the	goats.	But	when	we	got	there,	the	animals</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	all	gone.	I	would	have	said	they’d	wandered	off	on	their	own,	but	I	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	tire	tracks	in	the	dirt,	tracks	that	were	fatter	and	wider	than	those	of	my	Jeep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	big	off-road	truck,	if	I	had	to	guess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace	seemed	to	be	of	the	same	opinion,	because	he	squatted	down	to	take	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">closer	look,	one	finger	digging	into	the	rutted	earth.	“Probably	a	half-ton	pickup, judging	 by	 the	 tread	 and	 how	 deep	 it	 is.”	 He	 stood,	 following	 the	 tracks	 along the	narrow	dirt	road	that	led	to	the	pasture	gate.	We’d	come	in	that	same	way,	but it	looked	like	the	truck	had	turned	and	headed	west	afterward,	rather	than	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">east,	the	direction	of	town	and	our	own	hidden	compound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	do	you	think	they	were	going?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 have	 no	 idea.	 I	 don’t	 think	 there’s	 much	 out	 that	 way,	 unless	 they	 were headed	 to	 the	 highway.	 And	 if	 that’s	 the	 case,	 their	 home	 base	 could	 be anywhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	you	don’t	think	they’re	local?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	second	or	two,	Jace	didn’t	answer	me.	He	just	stood	there,	gazing	off	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	west,	straight	brows	pulled	together	in	a	frown.	The	wind	blew	his	loose	hair, turning	 it	 into	 a	 shining	 raven	 cloud	 around	 his	 head,	 but	 for	 some	 reason,	 I didn’t	 find	 myself	 quite	 as	 lost	 in	 admiration	 as	 I	 might	 otherwise	 have	 been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead,	a	shiver	of	apprehension	went	down	my	spine.	Whatever	thoughts	might</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	occupying	his	mind,	they	didn’t	look	as	if	they	were	pleasant	ones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	if	they’re	from	around	here,”	he	said	at	last.	“Maybe,	maybe</p>
<p class="calibre1">not.	 Maybe	 one	 of	 the	 survivors	 knew	 this	 ranch	 existed,	 then	 noticed	 some	 of the	 goats	 were	 missing	 and	 came	 back	 to	 get	 the	 rest	 before	 they	 disappeared, too.	And	maybe	they’re	holed	up	someplace	remote,	just	like	we	are.”	He	turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	began	heading	back	to	the	Jeep,	walking	quickly.	I	practically	had	to	jog	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">keep	up	with	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 almost	 asked	 what	 the	 rush	 was,	 but	 he	 seemed	 to	 know	 what	 I	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking.	Jaw	tense,	he	told	me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	it’s	better	that	we	get	back.	We’ve	been	gone	long	enough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing	 else,	 but	 the	 implication	 was	 enough	 to	 make	 me	 hurry	 into	 the passenger	 seat,	 to	 hold	 on	 as	 he	 drove	 faster	 than	 he	 really	 should	 have	 on	 the way	 home,	 the	 trailer	 rattling	 and	 bumping	 behind	 us.	 It	 was	 a	 beautiful,	 brisk fall	 day,	 but	 I	 couldn’t	 enjoy	 the	 scenery.	 I	 just	 wanted	 to	 get	 home	 and	 make sure	everything	was	all	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	anything	had	happened	to	Dutchie…. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a>But	 when	 we	 pulled	 up	 and	 opened	 the	 gate,	 everything	 looked	 fine.	 The goats	were	still	wandering	around,	eating	dried	grass,	and	I	could	hear	the	hens</p>
<p class="calibre1">clucking	 away	 in	 the	 chicken	 coop.	 Jace	 maneuvered	 the	 Jeep	 around	 so	 he could	back	the	trailer	up	to	the	edge	of	the	yard.	That	way,	he	wouldn’t	have	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">carry	the	lumber	as	far.	He	left	it,	though,	to	come	with	me	to	the	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	me	go	in	first,”	he	said,	and	I	did	as	he	asked,	allowing	him	to	walk	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">front	of	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 that	 did	 was	 subject	 him	 to	 the	 first	 of	 Dutchie’s	 onslaught.	 She	 came bounding	 up	 to	 us,	 panting,	 tail	 wagging,	 nose	 busily	 sniffing	 the	 bags	 we carried.	 Since	 all	 they	 held	 was	 the	 clothing	 we’d	 pilfered	 from	 REI,	 she	 lost interest	 soon	 enough,	 instead	 hanging	 out	 by	 the	 pantry,	 clearly	 angling	 for	 a chewy	treat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 think	 it’s	 safe,”	 I	 told	 Jace,	 going	 to	 get	 the	 dog	 her	 treat.	 Maybe	 she hadn’t	 exactly	 earned	 it,	 but	 I	 was	 so	 happy	 to	 see	 her	 and	 the	 rest	 of	 the property	safe	that	I	didn’t	much	care. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably.	 I’ll	 go	 drop	 this	 stuff	 in	 the	 bedroom,	 though.	 That	 way	 I	 can check	the	rest	of	the	house.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 didn’t	 bother	 to	 stop	 him.	 If	 it	 made	 him	 feel	 better,	 he	 was	 welcome	 to search	every	inch	of	the	property. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 I	 gave	 Dutchie	 her	 treat,	 I	 paused	 and	 surveyed	 the	 kitchen.	 Nothing appeared	 out	 of	 place,	 unless	 you	 wanted	 to	 count	 some	 water	 slopped	 on	 the floor	around	the	dog’s	bowl.	The	world’s	neatest	drinker	she	was	not.	Otherwise, </p>
<p class="calibre1">though,	 it	 was	 tidy	 enough,	 the	 dishes	 stacked	 in	 the	 wooden	 drainer	 on	 the counter,	everything	I’d	used	to	make	breakfast	either	put	back	in	the	refrigerator or	the	pantry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace	 entered	 the	 kitchen	 then,	 relief	 plain	 on	 his	 face.	 “Everything	 looks fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Were	you	really	worried	it	wouldn’t?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.	I	suppose	—	”	He	stopped	there,	clearly	trying	to	decide	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	really	wanted	to	say.	“I	suppose	seeing	all	that	stuff	taken	rattled	me.	I’m	not sure	 why.	 Maybe	 because	 the	 last	 time	 we	 were	 in	 town,	 I	 didn’t	 see	 any evidence	of	other	survivors.	Now,	though….”	His	shoulders	lifted;	I	noticed	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’d	taken	off	the	leather	jacket	he’d	worn	on	our	expedition.	“I	know	it’s	stupid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 have	 just	 as	 much	 right	 to	 help	 themselves	 to	 supplies	 as	 we	 do.	 But	 the way	they	came	in	and	took	all	the	rest	of	the	goats?	It	feels…greedy,	I	guess.	We</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	took	what	we	needed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 could	 see	 what	 he	 was	 thinking,	 but	 at	 the	 same	 time,	 I	 wasn’t	 sure	 I wanted	to	ascribe	any	negative	intentions	to	the	people	who’d	collected	the	rest</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 herd.	 “Maybe…or	 maybe	 they	 saw	 them	 and	 were	 worried	 about	 them, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p171"></a>the	same	way	we	were,	and	took	them	all	because	they	had	more	room	for	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	could	be	all	sorts	of	reasons.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 probably	 right.”	 The	 square	 set	 of	 his	 shoulders	 seemed	 to	 relax	 a little,	 and	 he	 came	 over	 to	 me	 and	 took	 me	 in	 his	 arms,	 holding	 me	 tightly against	 him.	 Something	 of	 the	 cool	 juniper-scented	 wind	 outdoors	 seemed	 to have	 clung	 to	 his	 hair,	 and	 I	 breathed	 it	 in,	 marveling	 at	 how	 the	 feel	 of	 him could	 drive	 all	 worries	 right	 out	 of	 my	 head.	 Whoever	 had	 absconded	 with	 the goats,	 it	 really	 didn’t	 matter	 in	 the	 grand	 scheme	 of	 things.	 We	 had	 enough	 to keep	our	own	little	homestead	going,	and	would	have	more	goats	in	the	spring, </p>
<p class="calibre1">once	 the	 does	 gave	 birth.	 Really,	 in	 a	 couple	 of	 seasons	 we’d	 be	 swimming	 in animals	and	wondering	what	the	heck	we	were	supposed	to	do	with	all	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	 make	 some	 sandwiches,”	 I	 offered,	 after	 I	 glanced	 at	 the	 clock	 and realized	it	was	nearly	one-thirty,	past	the	time	when	we’d	usually	eat	lunch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace	nodded,	but	I	could	tell	from	the	way	his	mouth	was	set	that	he	was	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">turning	 the	 problem	 over	 in	 his	 head.	 Well,	 if	 he	 wanted	 to	 brood	 over	 it,	 I couldn’t	stop	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	just	knew	it	would	be	fine.	It	had	to	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	days	seemed	to	blur	after	that,	running	together	until	I	realized	that	we	were less	 than	 a	 week	 away	 from	 Thanksgiving.	 Jace	 had	 spent	 long	 hours	 building the	shed	for	the	goats,	doing	his	best	to	make	sure	they	didn’t	have	to	be	exposed to	the	elements	any	longer	than	absolutely	necessary.	And	they	did	seem	grateful</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	the	shelter	we	provided,	going	in	there	without	any	urging	from	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 a	 child,	 I’d	 read	 all	 those	 “Little	 House”	 books	 about	 Laura	 Ingalls Wilder	and	her	family	moving	from	place	to	place,	homesteading,	farming,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">although	I	thought	I’d	absorbed	most	of	the	details,	it	wasn’t	until	I	was	doing</p>
<p class="calibre1">roughly	the	same	thing	myself	that	I	understood	how	time-consuming	having	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	 everything	 yourself	 actually	 was.	 And	 yes,	 I	 realized	 that	 Jace	 and	 I	 were living	in	a	modern,	up-to-date	house	with	a	lot	of	conveniences	that	Ms.	Wilder</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	never	have	conceived	of.	Even	so,	there	was	still	housework	and	laundry</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 cooking	 and	 so	 much	 more,	 like	 making	 cheese	 and	 sausage	 and	 butter, collecting	eggs,	making	sure	the	goats	had	fresh	water	and	were	milked	twice	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">day,	tending	the	plants	in	the	greenhouse	and	determining	what	was	ready	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a>eaten	and	what	still	needed	a	few	days.	By	the	time	we	were	done	with	dinner and	the	clean-up	afterward,	Jace	and	I	were	practically	asleep	on	our	feet.	Every</p>
<p class="calibre1">once	in	a	great	while,	we’d	sit	down	and	watch	a	movie	from	the	collection	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	family	room,	but	that	happened	maybe	every	ten	days	or	so,	if	that.	And	no, </p>
<p class="calibre1">we	never	watched	any	of	the	real	estate	developer’s	porn.	Jace	had	looked	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">row	of	Blue-Rays	and	chuckled,	shooting	me	an	inquiring	look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	way	in	hell,”	I’d	told	him,	and	he’d	let	it	go.	I	wasn’t	about	to	confess</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 I	 actually	 had	 tried	 to	 watch	 one	 of	 them	 in	 the	 first	 week	 I’d	 been	 here, lonely	 and	 scared	 and	 thinking	 maybe	 giving	 myself	 an	 orgasm	 would	 help	 to relax	me.	But	about	five	minutes	of	looking	at	the	actors	with	their	unnaturally</p>
<p class="calibre1">waxed	 bodies	 and	 the	 women	 with	 their	 fake	 breasts	 and	 equally	 fake	 moans made	me	less	inclined	toward	sex	than	I’d	ever	been	in	my	life,	and	I	took	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">disc	out	of	the	player	and	put	it	away,	knowing	I	could	never	watch	one	of	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">movies	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	now,	I	had	no	need	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	 some	 unspoken	 agreement,	 Jace	 and	 I	 had	 begun	 making	 love	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning,	while	the	world	was	still	dark	and	the	day	hadn’t	wrung	every	last	drop</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 energy	 from	 us.	 Sometimes	 one	 of	 us	 would	 wake	 up	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 the night	 and	 reach	 out	 for	 the	 other,	 and	 we’d	 cling	 together	 in	 a	 sort	 of	 frenzy before	passing	out	again,	but	it	wasn’t	a	common	occurrence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	so,	it	was	a	good	life.	The	weariness	I	felt	every	day	when	I	lay	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 sleep…it	 was	 a	 good	 kind	 of	 tired,	 the	 kind	 you	 got	 when	 you’d	 spent	 your day	 doing	 something	 that	 felt	 useful,	 worthwhile.	 I	 could	 tell	 that	 Jace	 viewed our	 existence	 the	 same	 way,	 that	 he	 didn’t	 have	 any	 regrets	 about	 the	 life	 we were	living.	In	a	post-industrial	world,	this	seemed	to	be	the	new	normal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	all	that,	though,	I	still	had	this	nagging	sensation	at	the	back	of	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind,	as	if	I	was	missing	something	vitally	important,	that	if	I	could	only	put	the pieces	together	in	the	right	order,	I’d	figure	out	what	had	been	bothering	me	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	 time.	 It	 was	 sort	 of	 like	 looking	 at	 one	 of	 those	 “magic	 eye”	 pictures	 and attempting	 to	 puzzle	 out	 what	 exactly	 the	 hidden	 image	 was.	 I	 was	 never	 very good	at	that,	either.	No	matter	how	hard	I	tried,	I	could	only	see	a	blur	of	color that	didn’t	mean	anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 meantime,	 Thanksgiving	 came,	 and	 we	 feasted	 on	 pheasant,	 which	 I found	I	enjoyed	far	more	than	turkey.	Maybe	that	was	simply	because,	although</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	mother	knew	her	way	around	a	turkey,	my	Aunt	Susan	really	didn’t,	and	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 alternating	 Thanksgivings	 I’d	 had	 to	 eat	 dried-out	 bird	 smothered	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">cranberry	sauce	to	give	it	a	decent	flavor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	such	worries	with	the	pheasant	Jace	brought	home,	which	was	moist	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">delicious,	especially	paired	with	a	sauce	I	made	from	currants	he’d	found	during</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a>one	of	his	hunting	expeditions.	And	combined	with	wild	rice	and	sautéed	green beans	from	the	greenhouse	—	well,	it	was	probably	the	best	Thanksgiving	meal</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	ever	consumed,	even	if	I	couldn’t	help	looking	at	all	the	empty	seats	around</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	huge	dining	room	table	and	thinking	it	would	have	been	wonderful	to	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">friends	and	family	there	to	share	the	meal	with	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	that	world	was	long	gone,	and	if	I	were	destined	to	spend	the	rest	of	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">life	around	only	one	person,	I	couldn’t	think	of	anyone	better	than	Jace	to	share</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	with.	During	that	meal,	he’d	gone	quiet	a	time	or	two,	and	I	had	a	feeling	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 thinking	 the	 same	 thing,	 that	 Thanksgiving	 was	 supposed	 to	 be	 about sharing,	about	being	with	loved	ones,	and	now	ours	were	all	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those	 somber	 moments	 were	 fleeting,	 though,	 and	 I	 could	 tell	 he	 wasn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	 to	 let	 the	 memories	 of	 what	 once	 was	 ruin	 what	 we	 had	 now.	 He	 joked about	Dutchie	wanting	to	eat	that	pheasant	whole	before	it	even	hit	the	back	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	ATV,	and	praised	my	cooking,	raising	a	glass	to	honor	my	efforts.	It	did	feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">good.	 Before	 all	 this,	 I	 would	 never	 have	 said	 I	 was	 particularly	 domestic,	 but I’d	risen	to	the	occasion	with	more	success	than	I	could	have	imagined. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Also,	 I’d	 surprised	 him	 by	 putting	 on	 the	 black	 dress	 I’d	 brought	 from Albuquerque,	and	my	jeweled	sandals,	and	those	amazing	tanzanite	earrings	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 so	 mysteriously	 shown	 up	 in	 my	 pocket	 after	 my	 first	 visit	 to	 the	 plaza	 in Santa	Fe.	Actual	makeup,	my	hair	styled	as	best	I	could,	since	I	hadn’t	brought</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	curling	irons	or	hot	rollers	with	me,	thinking	I’d	never	need	them	again.	Jace had	 taken	 one	 look	 at	 me	 and	 asked,	 “You	 expect	 me	 to	 be	 patient	 all	 through dinner	with	you	looking	like	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	given	him	a	sphinx-like	smile	and	continued	teetering	my	way	back	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">forth	from	the	kitchen,	bringing	food	to	the	table.	Funny	how	just	a	month	or	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	hiking	boots	had	apparently	killed	all	my	ability	to	walk	in	heels. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	after	dinner,	Jace	surprised	me	by	taking	me	in	his	arms,	actually	lifting</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	away	from	the	dining	room	table	and	carrying	me	to	the	bedroom,	where	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">proceeded	to	show	me	exactly	how	much	he	appreciated	me,	mouth	moving	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">teasing	 slowness	 across	 my	 skin,	 his	 fingers	 stroking	 me,	 finding	 exactly	 the right	spot	to	wring	moans	of	ecstasy	from	a	place	so	deep	that	before	I’d	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 him,	 I	 hadn’t	 even	 known	 it	 existed.	 Then	 we	 were	 together	 once	 more, bodies	locked,	moving	in	a	rhythm	that	had	become	second	nature	to	us	by	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	really	how	it	felt…natural,	as	if	my	body	had	been	made	to	fit	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">his,	 and	 the	 reason	 it	 had	 never	 worked	 with	 anyone	 else	 was	 simply	 that	 they hadn’t	 been	 the	  <i class="calibre3">one</i>.	 We	 fell	 asleep	 in	 one	 another’s	 arms,	 a	 perfect	 end	 to	 a perfect	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	week	after	that,	we	had	our	first	snowfall.	At	first,	I	didn’t	even	know	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	happening,	only	caught	an	odd	flicker	of	movement	out	of	the	corner	of	my</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a>eye	while	I	was	clearing	up	the	breakfast	dishes.	The	skies	had	been	heavy	and gray	 when	 we	 woke	 up	 that	 morning,	 and	 Jace	 said	 it	 smelled	 like	 snow.	 I’d laughed	at	him	over	that	remark,	although	really,	he	would	know	more	about	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	 I	 would,	 since	 he’d	 grown	 up	 in	 Taos.	 When	 I	 was	 in	 high	 school, Albuquerque	 had	 been	 hit	 by	 a	 freak	 snowstorm	 that	 basically	 shut	 the	 city down,	 but	 that	 was	 my	 only	 real	 experience	 with	 snow,	 save	 for	 a	 light	 flurry here	and	there	that	didn’t	stick	around	long	enough	to	cause	any	trouble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This,	though	—	it	drifted	downward,	light	and	delicate,	the	flakes	settling	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	goats’	shed	and	the	chicken	coop	and	the	evergreens	in	the	backyard,	giving</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything	a	soft	sugar	frosting.	I	stood	at	the	window,	a	dish	still	in	my	hands, and	stared	at	the	miracle	of	it,	how	beautiful	it	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 was	 so	 transfixed	 that	 I	 didn’t	 even	 realize	 Jace	 had	 come	 up	 behind	 me, not	until	his	arms	wrapped	around	my	waist	and	his	breath	came	warm	against</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	neck	as	he	said,	“Looks	like	winter	is	really	here	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 we’re	 all	 safe	 and	 snug	 inside,”	 I	 responded,	 setting	 the	 dish	 in	 the drain	 before	 I	 could	 drop	 it.	 The	 sensation	 of	 having	 him	 there,	 pressed	 up against	me,	was	enough	to	send	all	sorts	of	tingles	up	and	down	my	spine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 we	 are.	 I’ll	 go	 out	 and	 check	 on	 the	 goats	 in	 a	 bit,	 just	 to	 make	 sure there	aren’t	any	leaks	in	the	shed	or	anything,	but	I	think	we’ll	ride	this	out	just fine.”	He	shifted,	as	if	glancing	up	at	the	ceiling,	then	added,	“But	we	may	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	lights	for	much	longer.	With	cloud	cover	this	thick,	the	solar’s	not	going	to do	us	much	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	we’ll	spend	our	day	by	candlelight,”	I	replied.	“I’ll	turn	off	anything</p>
<p class="calibre1">extraneous	 —	 maybe	 that	 way,	 there’ll	 be	 enough	 of	 a	 trickle	 to	 keep	 the refrigerator	going.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	a	bad	plan.	You	may	want	to	go	scrounge	some	extra	candles	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">basement.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	do	that	as	soon	as	I’m	finished	with	these	dishes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 lips	 brushed	 against	 my	 cheek	 as	 he	 gave	 me	 a	 soft	 kiss,	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">acknowledgment	of	my	words.	Then	he	let	go	of	me,	heading	toward	the	laundry</p>
<p class="calibre1">room	 and	 the	 mudroom	 beyond	 that,	 where	 he	 could	 get	 into	 his	 jacket	 and gloves	and	brave	the	snow	to	check	on	the	livestock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 really	 weren’t	 that	 many	 dishes	 to	 do,	 so	 I	 was	 done	 in	 the	 next	 few minutes.	After	that,	I	went	from	room	to	room,	making	sure	we	hadn’t	left	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">lights	 on.	 In	 general,	 we	 were	 pretty	 careful	 about	 that	 sort	 of	 thing,	 but	 I	 did realize	that	I	needed	to	put	the	computer	in	sleep	mode	so	it	wouldn’t	draw	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	power	than	was	strictly	necessary.	If	something	happened	to	set	off	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 periphery	 alarms,	 it	 would	 turn	 back	 on	 right	 away,	 but	 in	 the	 meantime	 it could	hibernate. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a>After	 that	 I	 got	 a	 flashlight	 from	 the	 drawer	 in	 the	 kitchen	 where	 we	 kept them,	and	headed	down	into	the	basement.	It	had	its	own	lights,	of	course,	but	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	really	were	in	for	a	snowy	day,	I	didn’t	want	to	turn	them	on	and	waste	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">power.	The	flashlight	would	do	well	enough,	even	if	it	was	a	little	creepy	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">wandering	around	down	there	with	only	a	narrow	beam	to	show	me	what	I	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">doing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	 come	 down	 here	 once	 before	 to	 fetch	 the	 candles,	 but	 that	 had	 been weeks	 ago,	 before	 Jace	 had	 even	 shown	 up	 at	 the	 compound.	 The	 basement actually	was	very	organized,	with	rows	of	metal	shelving	and	the	items	on	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">arranged	according	to	use.	Even	so,	I	couldn’t	exactly	recall	where	I’d	found	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">candles	that	last	time.	On	the	left,	about	five	rows	down? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figuring	 it	 was	 worth	 a	 try,	 I	 shone	 the	 flashlight’s	 beam	 in	 that	 general direction,	 but	 saw	 only	 bins	 of	 what	 looked	 like	 bundles	 of	 wire	 and	 cable, possibly	intended	for	repairs	to	the	home’s	electrical	system,	should	the	occasion warrant.	Undeterred,	I	moved	to	the	next	row,	only	to	have	my	foot	bump	into	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cardboard	box	sitting	on	the	ground	next	to	one	of	the	shelving	units	rather	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">placed	 directly	 on	 it.	 That	 was	 strange,	 simply	 because	 everything	 else	 I’d encountered	in	the	basement	so	far	had	shown	an	almost	fanatical	adherence	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">order	on	the	part	of	the	person	who	had	put	it	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	frowned	and	moved	the	flashlight’s	beam	over	the	box.	It	had	clearly	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	some	kind	of	a	manufacturer;	there	was	even	a	shipping	label	still	affixed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	it.	Crouching	down,	I	read	the	name	and	address. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Cory	Berman</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">28-A	Skyline	Trail</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Santa	Fe,	NM	87501</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Cory	 Berman.	 So	 was	 that	 the	 name	 of	 the	 developer	 from	 Phoenix	 who’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">built	 the	 property,	 or	 the	 caretaker	 who’d	 kept	 watch	 over	 it?	 Maybe	 it	 didn’t really	matter.	They	were	both	gone,	after	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	did	matter,	as	I	read	the	lettering	stamped	on	the	box	itself,	was	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	been	sent	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Yaesu	FT-857D	Amateur	Radio	Transceiver</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Holy	crap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	ham	radio? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	way	to	make	contact	with	other	survivors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heart	 pounding,	 I	 shone	 the	 flashlight	 around	 and	 saw	 another	 package,	 a much	longer	one,	that	seemed	to	contain	the	antenna	to	go	with	the	radio.	Damn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	know	the	first	thing	about	setting	up	a	ham	radio,	or	its	antenna,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">maybe	 Jace	 would.	 Or	 at	 least	 could	 puzzle	 out	 the	 instructions.	 We’d	 have	 to wait	for	the	snowstorm	to	blow	over	before	we	could	go	up	on	the	roof	to	mount</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a>the	antenna,	but	in	the	meantime	we	could	read	up	on	how	to	use	the	radio	itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	could	change	everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	halfway	to	the	cellar	stairs	before	I	remembered	I’d	come	down	here	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 first	 place	 to	 pick	 up	 some	 spare	 candles.	 After	 going	 up	 and	 down	 a	 few more	 rows	 of	 shelving,	 I	 found	 them	 —	 pack	 after	 pack	 of	 shrink-wrapped pillars	and	votives	and	tapers,	the	sort	of	thing	you’d	buy	in	bulk	for	a	wedding</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	some	other	large	event.	I	grabbed	a	flat	of	pillar	candles	and	headed	back	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	stairway,	then	hurried	up	to	the	main	level	of	the	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace	 was	 nowhere	 in	 evidence	 as	 I	 set	 the	 package	 of	 candles	 down	 on	 the breakfast	table	in	the	nook.	When	I	peered	out	the	window,	though,	I	could	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	hauling	something	from	the	garage	to	the	shed.	A	sack	of	the	pellets	we	used</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	supplement	the	goats’	diet,	it	looked	like.	That	made	sense	—	they	probably</p>
<p class="calibre1">weren’t	going	to	head	out	to	forage	until	the	snow	stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">About	ten	minutes	later,	I	heard	him	come	in,	then	waited	as	he	stopped	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 mudroom	 to	 get	 rid	 of	 his	 coat	 and	 scrape	 the	 snow	 from	 his	 boots.	 In	 the meantime,	I’d	gone	around	the	house	and	lit	a	number	of	candles,	as	it	was	clear</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 the	 lowering	 skies	 outside	 that	 we	 probably	 wouldn’t	 see	 any	 sun	 today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Actually,	it	was	so	dark	that	it	almost	felt	as	if	dusk	was	coming	early,	which	of course	was	ridiculous.	At	this	time	of	year,	the	days	were	short,	but	they	weren’t <i class="calibre3">that</i>	short. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	up?”	he	asked,	almost	as	soon	as	he	entered	the	kitchen.	I	supposed</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	could	tell	I	was	fairly	dancing	with	impatience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Guess	what	I	found	in	the	basement?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	brow	lifted	slightly.	“You	know,	that	question	generally	doesn’t	have	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	answer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	serious.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	am	I.”	But	I	could	tell	by	the	twitch	at	the	corner	of	his	full	lips	that	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t…not	really. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	ham	radio,”	I	announced.	Jace	appeared	nonplussed	by	that	revelation,	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 went	 on,	 “It’s	 still	 in	 its	 original	 packing…I	 think	 it	 was	 delivered	 here	 but never	used.	And	there’s	an	antenna,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	felt	a	stir	of	impatience.	“What	do	you	mean,	‘and’?	With	that	radio,	we	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">try	 to	 reach	 out	 to	 any	 other	 survivors,	 find	 out	 where	 they	 are,	 how	 they’re doing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	 they	 don’t	 want	 to	 be	 found.	 It	 seems	 as	 if	 they’ve	 done	 a	 pretty good	job	of	hiding	so	far.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	have	we,”	I	pointed	out.	“But	it	doesn’t	mean	we	don’t	want	people	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">find	us.	Or…do	we?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a>Without	replying,	he	went	to	one	of	the	cupboards	and	got	out	a	glass,	then filled	 it	 with	 water.	 He	 drank	 some,	 his	 gaze	 not	 fixed	 on	 me,	 but	 on	 the increasingly	 snowy	 landscape	 outside	 the	 window.	 “I	 don’t	 know,”	 he	 said	 at last.	“You	wouldn’t	think	there’d	be	much	of	a	struggle	for	resources,	not	with	so few	of	us	left,	but	after	hearing	what	happened	to	you	in	Albuquerque,	I’m	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">sure	 I’m	 willing	 to	 trust	 anyone	 right	 now.	 What	 if	 there’s	 a	 bigger,	 more organized	 group	 out	 there,	 one	 that	 decides	 what	 we	 have	 here	 is	 better	 than where	they’re	living?	We	have	weapons,	but	there	are	only	two	of	us.	Would	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	willing	to	risk	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	put	it	that	way….	Involuntarily,	my	mind	flashed	back	to	the	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	Walgreens,	to	the	greed	in	his	watery	brown	eyes,	and	I	shivered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	I	admitted,	hoping	Jace	hadn’t	noticed	my	shudder.	“Of	course	I	don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">want	to	do	anything	that	would	put	us	in	harm’s	way.	But	maybe	if	we	set	it	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	just	listened,	didn’t	transmit?”	That	seemed	like	a	good	compromise	to	me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	Jace’s	grim	expression	didn’t	change.	After	a	perceptible	pause,	he	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe.	But	we’ll	have	to	wait	for	better	weather.	No	way	am	I	climbing	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	roof	in	a	snowstorm,	just	so	I	can	install	an	antenna.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	it	may	need	hardware	we	don’t	have,	so	then	we’d	have	to	go	back	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">town.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	prospect	I	didn’t	particularly	relish,	and	it	seemed	clear	enough	to	me	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace	wasn’t	looking	forward	to	it,	either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	we	can	figure	out	the	logistics	later,”	I	said.	“It’s	nothing	that	has	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">happen	right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	nodded,	and	I	let	the	matter	go,	instead	went	on	to	ask	him	what	sounded</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	for	dinner	that	night.	Something	in	the	tense	set	of	his	shoulders	appeared</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	relax.	It	didn’t	take	a	genius	to	figure	out	he	was	glad	that	I	didn’t	intend	to press	him	on	the	issue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Exactly	 why,	 I	 didn’t	 know.	 Was	 he	 really	 that	 worried	 about	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">consequences	of	contacting	other	survivors? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or	did	he	have	some	other	reason	why	he	wanted	us	to	stay	isolated	here? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a><img src="index-178_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="index-178_2.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">SIXTEEN</p>
<p class="calibre1">Actually,	 despite	 his	 obvious	 reluctance	 to	 do	 so,	 Jace	 did	 get	 to	 work	 on	 the antenna	 situation	 a	 few	 days	 later,	 after	 the	 weather	 had	 cleared.	 We	 bumped along	 the	 icy,	 muddy	 roads	 to	 go	 back	 to	 the	 hardware	 store,	 since,	 as	 he’d guessed,	we	didn’t	have	all	the	little	bits	and	pieces	necessary	for	the	installation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although	a	good	deal	of	the	snow	had	melted	by	then,	there	was	still	enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 it	 around	 to	 make	 driving	 treacherous,	 and	 I	 was	 more	 than	 happy	 to	 have Jace	 behind	 the	 wheel.	 He	 had	 experience	 driving	 in	 snow	 and	 ice,	 and	 I	 sure didn’t.	And	as	I	stared	out	at	the	streets	while	we	drove	along,	it	suddenly	hit	me, the	thing	that	had	been	niggling	at	the	back	of	my	mind	for	so	long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“None	of	the	cars	are	missing,”	I	said,	and	Jace	took	his	eyes	off	the	road	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	long	enough	to	shoot	me	a	quizzical	glance	before	returning	his	attention	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	icy	pavement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	glanced	back	out	the	window,	wanting	to	confirm	the	notion	that	had	finally</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken	coherent	shape	in	my	brain.	“You	know	how	I	said	that	it	seemed	like	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">weren’t	 as	 many	 vehicles	 around	 as	 I	 remembered,	 that	 some	 seemed	 to	 have gone	missing,	but	I	couldn’t	quite	figure	it	out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	nod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	the	 <i class="calibre3">cars</i>	are	all	here.	And	sure,	there	are	still	SUVs	and	trucks	all	over the	place.	But….”	I	let	the	words	trail	off	as	I	focused	on	the	patterns	I	now	saw</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p179"></a>on	the	streets	around	us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	bet	if	we	stopped	and	made	a	survey,	we’d	see	that	the	SUVs	and	trucks</p>
<p class="calibre1">left	behind	are	the	ones	without	much	utility.	Two-wheel	drive,	small	engines…</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 know,	 passenger	 cars	 with	 SUV	 bodies.	 The	 ones	 that	 can	 pull	 their	 own weight,	 like	 this	 Jeep	 —	 I	 have	 a	 feeling	 we	 won’t	 find	 as	 many	 of	 those around.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	then	we	were	almost	at	the	Home	Depot,	so	Jace	didn’t	say	anything	until</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	 he’d	 pulled	 into	 the	 parking	 lot	 and	 stopped.	 “You	 mean	 someone’s	 been coming	 here	 and	 systematically	 taking	 the	 trucks	 and	 the	 four-wheel-drive SUVs?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	doubt	I	could	prove	it,	but…yeah,	something	like	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shook	his	head	and	pulled	the	key	from	the	ignition,	then	slipped	it	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	pocket.	“In	a	way	it	makes	sense,	I	suppose.	Whoever	and	wherever	the	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">survivors	are,	they’re	going	to	have	to	do	a	lot	more	for	themselves.	So	having</p>
<p class="calibre1">vehicles	that	can	tow	things	and	haul	things	and	get	around	on	unplowed	roads</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 be	 vital.”	 His	 brows	 had	 been	 pulled	 together	 as	 he	 pondered	 the conundrum,	 but	 then	 he	 seemed	 to	 relax,	 and	 although	 the	 air	 was	 sharp	 and cold,	 a	 flicker	 of	 warmth	 went	 through	 me	 as	 he	 gave	 me	 an	 admiring	 glance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 was	 some	 pretty	 good	 detective	 work,	 Jess.	 I	 don’t	 think	 I	 would	 have even	noticed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 it’s	 just	 a	 theory,”	 I	 said	 deprecatingly,	 trying	 to	 convince	 myself	 as much	as	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Better	than	anything	I	could	come	up	with.”	Then	he	hesitated,	looking	past</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	down	the	street	that	fronted	the	store.	Of	course	it	was	completely	deserted, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	I	could	tell	he	was	worried.	“Maybe	you	should	stay	here.	You	know	—	keep</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	eye	on	the	car.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	really	didn’t	want	to	do	that,	but	if	it	turned	out	I	was	right	about	the	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	abandoned	vehicles	were	being	cherry-picked,	then	it	made	sense	for	me	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">stand	 watch.	 At	 least	 this	 time	 I’d	 remembered	 to	 bring	 a	 sidearm.	 It	 was hanging	in	a	holster	against	my	hip,	a	reminder	that	we	could	never	relax	all	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	 when	 we	 came	 into	 town.	 Jace	 had	 one	 as	 well,	 the	 big	 S&amp;W,	 which	 was better	suited	to	his	height	anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	 problem,”	 I	 said.	 All	 right,	 so	 I	 didn’t	 sound	 terribly	 enthusiastic,	 but neither	had	I	argued	with	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	leaned	down	and	kissed	me	on	the	cheek,	his	lips	warm	against	my	wind-</p>
<p class="calibre1">chilled	skin.	“I’ll	be	less	than	five	minutes.	I	just	need	some	brackets	and	wire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’ll	be	fast.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded,	and	he	reached	into	his	pocket	and	pulled	out	the	car	key. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p180"></a>“Just	in	case.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">In	 case	 of	 what? </i>	 I	 wanted	 to	 ask.	 I	 didn’t,	 though,	 only	 took	 the	 key	 from him	and	slid	it	into	my	coat	pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 that,	 he	 turned	 away	 from	 me	 and	 headed	 into	 the	 store,	 walking</p>
<p class="calibre1">quickly	despite	the	patches	of	ice	that	lingered	on	the	asphalt.	I	supposed	I	could have	 gotten	 back	 inside	 the	 Cherokee	 where	 it	 would	 be	 warmer,	 but	 I	 didn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead,	I	leaned	against	the	driver-side	door,	my	eyes	scanning	in	all	directions for…what?	 A	 batch	 of	 marauders	 out	 of	 a	 Mad	 Max	 movie,	 bearing	 down	 on me,	intent	on	stealing	my	SUV? </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	sign	of	anything	like	that	—	no	movement	at	all,	except	a	crow	that	came</p>
<p class="calibre1">flapping	down	the	street	and	then	perched	on	one	of	the	tall	lights	in	the	parking lot.	 It	 shook	 out	 its	 wings	 and	 settled	 down,	 fixing	 me	 with	 a	 baleful	 yellow gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Crap	on	my	car,	and	I’ll	use	you	for	target	practice, </i>	I	thought,	but	the	bird didn’t	 move,	 only	 sat	 on	 the	 lamppost,	 surveying	 the	 parking	 lot.	 In	 happier days,	it	might	have	had	some	pickings	there	—	the	uneaten	fries	from	some	kid’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">Happy	Meal,	a	spilled	Coke.	Now,	however,	the	lot	was	bare	of	anything	except</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	abandoned	vehicles	that	still	remained	there,	waiting	for	owners	who	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">never	return,	and	some	patches	of	unmelted	snow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	even	though	I	didn’t	see	anyone	else,	and	I	knew	I	was	perfectly	safe,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t	 help	 the	 wave	 of	 relief	 that	 washed	 over	 me	 when	 I	 saw	 Jace	 coming back	out	of	the	store,	carrying	several	bags’	worth	of	supplies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	looks	like	they	—	whoever	they	are	—	came	back.	More	stuff	is	gone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace	handed	me	the	bags,	and	I	got	the	car	key	out	of	my	pocket	and	gave	it	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stuff	you	needed?”	I	asked	anxiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	everything	we	came	here	to	get	is	pretty	esoteric.	But	now	the	batteries</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	 totally	 cleared	 out,	 and	 the	 solar	 garden	 lights,	 and	 —	 well,	 just	 a	 lot	 of different	things.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	batteries	would	have	worried	me,	except	that	we	had	flats	of	the	things</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	 in	 our	 basement,	 both	 regular	 and	 rechargeable.	 And	 solar	 garden	 lights? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	 property	 was	 outfitted	 with	 those,	 too.	 It	 seemed	 whoever	 was	 looting	 the Home	Depot,	they	were	coming	from	a	place	of	a	lot	more	need	than	either	Jace</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	I. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 we’d	 have	 to	 figure	 that	 out	 later.	 Or	 never.	 The	 weather	 seemed	 to	 be holding,	and	I	had	to	hope	it	would	stay	that	way	for	a	few	days,	long	enough	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace	could	get	the	antenna	installed.	Maybe	after	that	we	could	start	to	get	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">answers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Right	then,	though,	it	was	a	lot	more	important	that	we	get	home.	We	had	no</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p181"></a>evidence	 to	 show	 that	 anyone	 knew	 of	 our	 hideaway,	 but	 leaving	 it	 unattended always	made	me	feel	nervous.	Dutchie	would	bark	up	a	storm,	but	I	doubted	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">doing	so	would	be	enough	to	scare	off	anyone	who	was	determined	to	break	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	take	what	they	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Either	no	one	had	yet	discovered	the	compound,	or	any	survivors	in	the	area</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 decided	 it	 was	 easier	 pickings	 in	 town,	 because	 once	 again	 we	 returned	 to find	 everything	 as	 we	 had	 left	 it.	 We	 gave	 Dutchie	 her	 usual	 greeting	 of	 some scratching	 behind	 the	 ears	 and	 a	 treat,	 and	 then	 Jace	 went	 to	 survey	 the	 area outside	the	office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	 in	 luck,”	 he	 said,	 after	 prodding	 at	 the	 mud	 and	 driving	 a	 piece	 of rebar	down	into	the	ground.	“It’s	not	frozen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	that’s	relevant	because…?”	I	was	standing	a	few	feet	from	him,	close</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough	to	see	what	he	was	doing	but	not	so	close	that	I	would	be	in	the	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	I	have	to	install	a	ground	rod	in	addition	to	running	co-ax	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">antenna	to	the	unit	in	the	office.”	At	my	blank	look,	he	sort	of	grinned	and	shook his	head.	“It’s	a	little	more	complicated	than	sticking	a	TV	aerial	on	your	roof.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	 you	 do	 it?”	 As	 soon	 as	 the	 words	 left	 my	 mouth,	 I	 realized	 that	 I probably	 should	 have	 asked	 that	 question	 before	 we	 went	 to	 all	 the	 trouble	 of getting	supplies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	so.	I’ve	read	over	the	instructions	a	few	times.	Good	thing	I	learned</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	solder	in	my	shop	class	in	high	school.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	here	I’d	thought	all	we’d	have	to	do	was	install	the	antenna	on	the	roof, </p>
<p class="calibre1">run	some	wire,	and	 <i class="calibre3">voilà</i>,	we’d	be	chatting	it	up	with	survivors	around	the	globe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	should	have	known	nothing	would	be	that	easy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	he	got	to	it	in	earnest	after	that,	producing	a	ladder	from	the	garage	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">climbing	up	to	the	roof,	then	letting	me	hand	the	antenna	up	to	him	from	a	point</p>
<p class="calibre1">midway	 on	 the	 same	 ladder.	 I	 had	 to	 loiter	 there	 for	 some	 time,	 waiting	 so	 I could	catch	the	bundle	of	coaxial	cable	as	he	tossed	it	to	me	once	one	end	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 attached	 to	 the	 antenna.	 After	 he	 was	 done	 on	 the	 roof,	 Jace	 came	 down and	fastened	the	wire	to	the	exterior	wall	of	the	house	with	a	series	of	brackets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	handle	it	from	here,”	he	told	me.	“You’d	better	go	inside	—	your	lips</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	starting	to	turn	blue.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	 are	 not,”	 I	 protested,	 although	 truthfully,	 it	 was	 fairly	 cold	 outside, probably	only	a	few	degrees	above	freezing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	see	them.	You	can’t.”	He	grinned	at	me.	“Really,	I’ve	got	this.	Isn’t	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	time	for	you	to	be	starting	dinner	anyway?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chained	 to	 the	 stove,	 just	 like	 I	 thought,”	 I	 remarked,	 but	 I	 leavened	 the tartness	of	my	words	by	giving	him	a	quick	kiss	on	the	cheek.	“Don’t	stay	out	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">long	that	 <i class="calibre3">your</i>	lips	start	to	turn	blue.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p182"></a>“I	won’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	to	be	satisfied	with	that,	so	I	went	in	the	house	and	started	rummaging</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	 in	 the	 kitchen.	 Outside,	 the	 daylight	 slanted	 its	 way	 toward	 dusk,	 and before	 it	 got	 full	 dark,	 I	 heard	 Jace	 come	 inside,	 although	 he	 seemed	 to	 go straight	to	the	office	rather	than	stopping	in	the	kitchen	to	check	on	the	ETA	for dinner.	 Since	 I	 was	 making	 quickie	 rabbit	 stew	 that	 didn’t	 really	 need</p>
<p class="calibre1">babysitting,	as	it	was	now	in	the	“let	it	sit	in	the	pot	until	you’re	ready	to	eat	it” </p>
<p class="calibre1">stage,	 I	 headed	 back	 to	 the	 office,	 where	 I	 found	 Jace	 under	 the	 table	 we’d designated	as	the	ham	radio	workstation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everything	okay?”	I	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,”	 came	 his	 voice,	 somewhat	 muffled,	 since	 he	 was	 facing	 the	 wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	need	to	make	this	last	connection.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	 I	 really	 didn’t	 have	 anything	 better	 to	 do,	 I	 leaned	 against	 the doorframe	and	waited	as	he	wrenched	on	something.	A	few	minutes	and	a	couple</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	muffled	curses	later,	he	was	pushing	himself	out	from	beneath	the	table	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">getting	to	his	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	that	should	be	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	let’s	fire	it	up	and	see	if	we	can	find	anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	set	down	the	screwdriver	he	was	holding	and	crossed	his	arms.	“We	don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	to	rush	into	this,	you	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“After	you	just	spent	all	afternoon	working	on	it?”	I	said,	both	perplexed	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">irritated	 by	 his	 reluctance	 to	 use	 the	 radio.	 “If	 you	 didn’t	 think	 it	 was	 a	 good idea,	then	why	waste	so	much	time	and	effort	on	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	saying	that,”	he	replied,	digging	in	his	pocket	for	another	of	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">interminable	leather	cords	so	he	could	pull	his	hair	out	of	his	face.	I	wondered</p>
<p class="calibre1">why	he	hadn’t	done	that	earlier,	but	maybe	having	his	hair	down	on	his	neck	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">helped	to	keep	him	warm	while	he	was	up	working	on	the	roof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	what	are	you	saying?”	I	crossed	my	arms	and	tried	hard	not	to	scowl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 guess	 I	 just	 can’t	 figure	 out	 why	 you’re	 so	 reluctant	 to	 even	  <i class="calibre3">attempt</i>	 to	 find other	survivors,	especially	since	we	wouldn’t	be	talking	to	them,	just	scanning	to see	if	there	is	even	anyone	else	out	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 long	 pause.	 I	 could	 tell	 from	 the	 way	 his	 mouth	 tightened	 and	 he	 didn’t quite	look	at	me	that	he	wasn’t	particularly	eager	to	explain	himself.	Maybe	not, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	I	wasn’t	about	to	let	this	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	he	jammed	his	hands	into	his	jeans	pockets	and	said,	“All	right,	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	we	listen	in	and	find	some	survivors,	then	decide	they	sound	all	right	and	that we	should	reach	out	to	them?	What	if	they	turn	out	to	not	be	all	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Not	all	right’	as	in…what?”	I	asked,	wondering	what	he	was	driving	at.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">tried	 to	 think	 of	 the	 worst-case	 scenario	 and	 added,	 “Like,	 cannibals	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p183"></a>something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	grim	smile	touched	his	lips.	“No,	I	don’t	think	cannibalism	is	going	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	 issue,	 not	 with	 all	 the	 wild	 game	 to	 be	 had	 around	 here.	 More	 like….”	 The words	died	away,	and	he	hesitated	again.	“More	like,	what	if	they	turn	out	to	be	a bunch	of	good	old	boys	who	aren’t	exactly	thrilled	to	find	an	Indian	shacked	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	a	white	girl?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stared	at	him.	“That’s….”	I’d	been	about	to	say,  <i class="calibre3">That’s	ridiculous, </i> but	then I	 realized	 maybe	 it	 wasn’t.	 It	 should	 have	 been,	 but…I’d	 seen	 enough	 ugly incidents	involving	my	friend	Elena	to	know	prejudice	wasn’t	exactly	a	thing	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 past,	 even	 for	 someone	 who	 was	 beautiful	 and	 talented	 and	 came	 from	 a family	with	money.	The	worst	incident	had	been	at	a	frat	party	in	college,	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 drunk	 asshole	 told	 her,	 “Hey,  <i class="calibre3">chiquita</i>,	 you’re	 pretty	 hot.	 Why	 don’t	 you come	 over	 here	 and	 suck	 my	  <i class="calibre3">chalupa</i>?”	 Luckily,	 Tori	 was	 standing	 right	 there and	responded	by	dumping	her	cup	of	cheap	keg	beer	over	the	guy’s	head,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	 never	 forgotten	 that	 scene.	 I	 knew	 Elena	 hadn’t,	 either,	 even	 though	 she’d blown	it	off	at	the	time,	telling	us	the	guy	was	too	wasted	to	know	what	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">saying.	That	wasn’t	true,	though…he’d	known	 <i class="calibre3">exactly</i>	what	he	was	saying.	And so	had	she,	despite	trying	to	act	as	if	it	was	no	big	deal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 as	 much	 as	 I	 wanted	 to	 brush	 off	 Jace’s	 concerns	 as	 being	 completely unfounded,	 I	 knew	 they	 weren’t.	 Just	 because	 the	 calendar	 said	 it	 was	 the twenty-first	century,	it	didn’t	mean	that	everyone	had	gotten	the	memo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 while	 intellectually	 I	 could	 understand	 where	 he	 was	 coming	 from,	 I knew	 I’d	 never	 be	 able	 to	 feel	 that	 doubt,	 those	 misgivings,	 the	 way	 he	 did, because	I’d	come	from	a	completely	different	world.	I	was	a	white	girl.	Sure,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	a	Ute	great-great-grandmother	—	if	the	family	legend	was	even	true	—	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	didn’t	mean	I	could	relate	to	his	experiences	as	someone	who’d	grown	up	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 pueblo,	 who’d	 come	 at	 life	 in	 twenty-first-century	 America	 from	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">completely	different	angle	than	I	had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	you	see	what	I	mean,”	he	said	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.”	His	expression	brightened	a	little	at	that,	and	I	went	on,	“But…can’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	just	try	it	to	see	if	it	works?	No	one	will	know	we’re	doing	that	if	we	don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">transmit	anything,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 least	 he	 didn’t	 try	 to	 equivocate.	 “No,	 no	 one	 will	 know	 that	 we’re listening	in.	If	there’s	even	anything	to	listen	to.	But	we’ll	give	it	a	shot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace	went	to	the	ham	radio	receiver	and	switched	it	on.	When	he’d	set	it	up, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he’d	 told	 me	 that	 it	 was	 designed	 to	 be	 portable,	 that	 if	 we	 could	 locate	 a different	 antenna	 setup,	 we	 could	 even	 take	 it	 along	 with	 us	 in	 the	 Jeep	 if	 we wanted.	 Why	 we’d	 want	 to	 do	 that,	 I	 didn’t	 particularly	 know,	 but	 it	 could possibly	come	in	handy	one	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p184"></a>“Well,	here	goes,”	he	said,	pressing	the	power	button. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	soft	hiss	began	to	emerge	from	the	small	speakers	set	up	to	either	side	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	receiver.	Jace	began	scanning	along	the	bands,	going	slowly	enough	that	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 stop	 if	 he	 came	 across	 something	 interesting.	 All	 I	 heard	 was	 that	 hiss, sometimes	louder,	sometimes	softer,	but	even	I	knew	it	was	all	merely	dead	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then…what	sounded	like	a	faint,	tinny	voice,	a	single	syllable.	“Lo	—	” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 cut	 off	 with	 a	 screech	 and	 was	 replaced	 by	 more	 static.	 “Damn	 it,”	 Jace said,	scanning	back	to	the	band	where	the	sound	had	come	from.	But	there	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	voice	this	time,	only	an	angry,	crackling	hiss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	happened	to	it?”	I	asked,	coming	closer,	as	if	somehow	I	thought	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">presence	would	help	the	tuner	lock	back	on	to	the	signal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.”	He	sounded	irritated,	and	I	didn’t	blame	him.	All	that	work, </p>
<p class="calibre1">for	something	that	might	or	might	not	have	been	an	actual	person? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Keep	 scanning,”	 I	 suggested,	 and	 he	 expelled	 a	 breath	 and	 continued	 his slow	sweep	across	the	bands.	Just	more	hissing,	more	static. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 stomach	 clenched,	 and	 I	 told	 myself	 to	 calm	 down.	 Just	 because	 we</p>
<p class="calibre1">weren’t	 picking	 up	 anything	 now	 didn’t	 mean	 there	 was	 no	 one	 out	 there.	 The other	 survivors	 might	 not	 have	 the	 skill	 to	 operate	 ham	 radio	 equipment,	 or hadn’t	managed	to	set	theirs	up	yet.	It	wasn’t	as	if	Jace	and	I	were	alone	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">planet	—	the	missing	supplies	and	those	mysteriously	vanished	trucks	and	SUVs</p>
<p class="calibre1">told	 me	 other	 people	 were	 out	 there	 somewhere,	 and,	 from	 the	 look	 of	 it,	 they seemed	 to	 be	 fairly	 well-organized.	 Sooner	 or	 later,	 we’d	 have	 to	 cross	 paths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although	now,	after	what	Jace	had	confided	in	me	about	his	misgivings	on	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">score,	I	wasn’t	sure	meeting	up	with	other	people	would	be	as	beneficial	as	I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">previously	hoped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	getting	anything,”	Jace	said	at	last,	then	shut	off	the	receiver	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">turning	back	toward	me.	“Maybe	I	screwed	up	something	in	the	installation,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s	dark	out	now,	so	I	won’t	be	able	to	check	until	tomorrow	morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	fine,”	I	told	him,	even	though	I	didn’t	know	if	it	really	was.	“I	think	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">did	have	it	working.	I	just	think…no	one’s	transmitting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Still,	 I’ll	 investigate	 more	 tomorrow.”	 He	 glanced	 away	 from	 me,	 sniffed the	air.	“Smells	like	dinner’s	ready.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Almost,”	I	said,	knowing	that	he’d	changed	the	topic	on	purpose.	Still,	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">did	it	matter?	We	weren’t	getting	anything	out	of	that	ham	radio	tonight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	we	went	to	the	kitchen,	which	was	warm	and	smelled	of	good	and	savory</p>
<p class="calibre1">things	 —	 proven	 by	 Dutchie,	 who	 was	 loitering	 much	 closer	 to	 the	 stove	 than she	should	be.	I	shooed	her	away,	and	then	dished	up	our	food	while	Jace	got	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 kibble.	 Just	 another	 normal	 night…or	 as	 normal	 as	 things	 could	 ever	 be now. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p185"></a>That	syllable	was	still	rattling	around	in	my	head,	though.  <i class="calibre3">Lo</i>….	“Lo”	what? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	transmission	had	cut	off	so	quickly	that	I	didn’t	even	know	whether	it	truly</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	been	part	of	an	actual	broadcast	of	some	sort,	or	merely	a	weird	distortion</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	sounded	like	part	of	a	word	but	was	in	fact	only	a	nonsense	note	generated</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	a	rogue	sound	wave	or	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	speak	of	my	concerns	to	Jace,	though.	The	subject	of	the	ham	radio</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 a	 sore	 one	 already,	 and	 he	  <i class="calibre3">had</i>	 tried.	 I’d	 let	 it	 go	 for	 now,	 and	 maybe someday	 I’d	 learn	 if	 there	 truly	 had	 been	 someone	 broadcasting	 out	 there…or whether	I	was	only	imagining	things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">We	checked	the	radio	every	day	after	that,	but	got	nothing	but	static	and	hiss.	It was	 frustrating	 —	 for	 me,	 anyway	 —	 but	 as	 there	 didn’t	 seem	 to	 be	 much	 we could	do	about	the	communications	blackout,	we	put	it	aside	so	we	could	focus</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	more	important	things,	like	surviving	the	winter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	 it	 wasn’t	 that	 bad,	 but	 I	 still	 could	 tell	 I	 hadn’t	 become	 acclimated	 to the	 cold.	 Santa	 Fe	 probably	 averaged	 around	 ten	 to	 fifteen	 degrees	 colder	 than Albuquerque	 most	 of	 the	 time,	 but	 when	 that	 difference	 is	 between	 fifty-five degrees	 and	 forty,	 believe	 me,	 you	 can	  <i class="calibre3">feel</i>	 it.	 We	 had	 the	 wood	 stove	 in	 the sitting	room	going	all	the	time,	and	the	fireplaces	in	the	living	room	and	family</p>
<p class="calibre1">room	as	well,	but	you	could	still	sense	the	drop	in	temperature	when	you	went</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	of	 the	 range	of	 any	 of	them.	 Jace	 got	 in	the	 habit	 of	going	 to	 our	bedroom immediately	after	dinner	and	starting	a	fire	so	it	would	be	comfortable	enough	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	undressed	by	the	time	we	went	in	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	course	it	could	have	been	much	worse,	and	the	conditions	were	certainly</p>
<p class="calibre1">endurable,	but	all	the	same,	I	found	myself	missing	the	central	forced	heat	at	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">parents’	house	or	even	the	wall	unit	in	my	studio	apartment	over	the	garage.	That</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing	had	heated	up	fast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 those	 appliances	 were	 long	 gone,	 along	 with	 a	 million	 other	 comforts and	 conveniences	 I	 hadn’t	 even	 appreciated	 until	 I	 didn’t	 have	 them	 anymore, and	so	I	told	myself	not	to	worry	about	them,	that	I	was	damn	lucky	to	be	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	was	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Especially	since	I	could	be	here	with	Jace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 talked	 about	 the	 coming	 spring,	 about	 what	 we	 might	 be	 able	 to	 plant</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p186"></a>outside	 the	 greenhouse	 to	 supplement	 the	 crops	 we	 grew	 there.	 Because	 of	 the goats,	 we’d	 have	 to	 build	 a	 separate	 enclosure	 for	 another	 garden,	 since otherwise	 it	 would	 get	 eaten	 before	 we	 had	 a	 chance	 to	 harvest	 anything,	 but Jace	thought	he	could	manage	it,	especially	if	the	stores	of	lumber	down	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Home	Depot	didn’t	get	pilfered	by	whatever	survivors	were	still	lurking	around</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	occasionally,	after	I	was	done	hurriedly	washing	my	face	and	brushing</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 teeth,	 because	 the	 heat	 from	 the	 fireplace	 in	 the	 main	 part	 of	 the	 bedroom didn’t	quite	reach	into	the	bathroom,	I’d	pull	out	my	packet	of	pills	and	hesitate before	taking	one.	We	hadn’t	discussed	that	kind	of	future,	but	it	seemed	clear	to me	that	Jace	didn’t	intend	to	go	anywhere,	that	he	was	planning	on	a	future	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	in	it.	Was	it	crazy	to	consider	starting	a	family?	After	all,	someone	needed	to begin	repopulating	the	earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 after	 that	 wild	 moment	 of	 hesitation,	 I	 always	 popped	 the	 pill	 in	 my mouth	 and	 swallowed	 it	 resolutely.	 Having	 a	 baby	 was	 a	 crazy	 idea.	 With	 no doctors,	no	medical	facilities…no	epidurals? </p>
<p class="calibre1">No,	thanks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	funny	thing	was,	I’d	never	been	all	that	invested	in	the	idea	of	having	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">family.	Elena	was	the	one	who	wanted	to	get	married	and	have	lots	of	kids	(and	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">nanny,	of	course)	and	do	all	that	domestic	stuff,	and	Tori	wanted	to	be	a	social</p>
<p class="calibre1">worker	and	focus	on	other	people’s	kids,	not	her	own.	As	for	me,	well,	most	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 time	 my	 main	 concern	 had	 been	 finding	 someone	 to	 have	 a	 few	 dates	 with and	then	break	up	with	before	things	got	serious.	I’d	tried	serious	once,	and	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	had	gotten	me	was	taking	multiple	exams	for	a	bewildering	variety	of	social</p>
<p class="calibre1">diseases,	thanks	to	my	cheating	ex. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 Jace,	 though…it	 was	 different.	 So	 different	 that	 some	 days	 I	 could barely	wrap	my	head	around	it.	I	thought	it	would	probably	be	wonderful	to	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 child	 with	 him,	 because	 I	 had	 a	 feeling	 he’d	 be	 a	 great	 father.	 He	 certainly possessed	the	patience	and	the	quiet	good	humor.	I	knew	I	could	count	on	him	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	steady	under	pressure…a	lot	steadier	than	I,	when	you	got	right	down	to	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Also,	he	was	so	gorgeous	that	it	seemed	a	real	shame	to	let	all	that	amazing</p>
<p class="calibre1">DNA	go	to	waste. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More	 important	 than	 all	 that,	 however,	 was	 that	 I	 loved	 him.	 I	 wanted	 to bring	something	into	the	world	that	came	from	our	shared	love,	that	showed	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">commitment	to	one	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	knew	better	than	to	bring	up	the	subject,	though.	One	day,	the	time	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	right	to	discuss	a	future	beyond	the	next	planting	season,	but	I	didn’t	think	we were	there.	Not	quite	yet,	anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 cold	 days	 slid	 past.	 It	 snowed	 here	 and	 there,	 but	 never	 enough	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p187"></a>completely	bury	us,	just	enough	to	make	the	world	pretty	to	look	at	and	a	pain	to get	 around	 in.	 Christmas	 would	 be	 here	 in	 less	 than	 a	 week,	 and	 I	 had	 no	 idea what	to	do	about	that.	I	wanted	to	give	Jace	something,	but	I	couldn’t	exactly	nip out	to	the	mall	and	buy	him	a	sweater.	Yes,	we	could	go	into	town	together	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">split	up	while	we	picked	out	presents	for	one	another,	but	that	didn’t	sound	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">safe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 I	 mentioned	 Christmas	 to	 him,	 that	 I	 wished	 I	 could	 get	 him</p>
<p class="calibre1">something,	he’d	pulled	me	against	him	and	given	me	a	strong,	lingering	kiss,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">kind	that	made	me	want	to	drag	him	back	to	the	bedroom	and	tear	all	his	clothes</p>
<p class="calibre1">off,	although	we’d	have	to	pause	long	enough	to	get	a	fire	started	before	I	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">safely	do	that.	And	he’d	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	the	only	present	I	need.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	was	I	supposed	to	respond	to	that	statement?	By	kissing	him	back,	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">course,	 and	 telling	 myself	 that	 presents	 didn’t	 matter,	 that	 being	 here	 together was	what	mattered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 next	 day	 he	 went	 out	 with	 the	 ATV,	 saying	 he	 was	 going	 hunting,	 and since	 he	 went	 on	 these	 expeditions	 a	 few	 times	 a	 week,	 I	 didn’t	 think	 all	 that much	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	then	he	returned	carrying	a	beautiful	pine	tree,	a	little	bit	taller	than	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was,	and	I	realized	he	had	given	me	my	present,	the	one	thing	I’d	really	wanted</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	along. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	 did	 you	 know	 I	 wanted	 a	 Christmas	 tree?”	 I	 asked,	 watching	 as	 he settled	 it	 in	 a	 corner	 of	 the	 living	 room.	 It	 had	 a	 stand	 made	 of	 two	 pieces	 of wood	attached	to	the	bottom	of	the	trunk,	so	he	must	have	stopped	at	the	garage</p>
<p class="calibre1">first	to	hammer	those	on	before	coming	to	the	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 guessed.	 I	 saw	 the	 look	 in	 your	 eyes	 when	 you	 were	 talking	 about</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christmas,	 and….”	 His	 shoulders	 lifted,	 and	 he	 reached	 out	 to	 make	 a	 minute adjustment	 so	 the	 tree	 sat	 more	 squarely	 in	 the	 corner.	 “I	 thought	 you	 should have	some	sort	of	holiday,	even	if	it	can’t	be	like	what	you	were	used	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 perfect,”	 I	 said	 sincerely.	 And	 it	 was,	 especially	 because	 I	 knew	 Jace wasn’t	Christian,	and	might	not	have	even	had	a	tree	while	he	was	growing	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	he’d	still	realized	how	important	following	these	traditions	was	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Glad	 you	 like	 it.”	 He	 stepped	 back	 a	 few	 feet	 from	 the	 tree,	 looking	 at	 it with	narrowed	eyes,	as	if	making	sure	it	stood	as	straight	as	it	possibly	could.	“I didn’t	have	anything	to	use	as	a	bowl,	so	I’m	not	sure	how	we’ll	keep	it	fresh.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	 get	 some	 paper	 towels	 and	 dampen	 them,	 then	 wrap	 them	 around	 the bottom	of	the	trunk.	It	should	work	okay.”	I	gazed	at	the	tree,	wondering	what	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	to	decorate	it.	Go	to	town	and	raid	the	nearest	Michael’s?	No,	that	wouldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">work,	even	if	I	could	convince	Jace	to	take	me	on	such	a	frivolous	expedition. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p188"></a>The	 Heat	 had	 struck	 in	 late	 September,	 and	 even	 a	 store	 as	 gung-ho	 for Christmas	as	Michael’s	wouldn’t	have	had	any	decorations	out	then.	Should	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">raid	random	houses	along	Upper	Canyon	Road	and	see	if	they	had	any	boxes	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christmas	decorations	hidden	in	their	garages? </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	sounded	even	worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 I	 remembered	 the	 jars	 of	 popping	 corn	 in	 the	 pantry.	 Perfect.	 Old-fashioned,	 but	 it	 suited	 the	 way	 we	 were	 living	 now.	 “We	 can	 make	 popcorn strings,	and	I’ll	use	one	of	the	spare	Mexican	blankets	in	the	linen	closet	to	wrap around	the	base.	It’ll	look	great.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace	nodded.	“Sounds	good.	I’ll	try	not	to	eat	all	the	popcorn	before	you	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	on	the	string.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Better	not,”	I	warned	him,	and	went	to	kiss	him	on	the	cheek	before	heading</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	 to	 the	 kitchen.	 I	 had	 no	 idea	 how	 much	 popcorn	 to	 make	 to	 cover	 a	 seven-foot	tree,	but	I	got	the	feeling	I	was	about	to	find	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 good	 deal,	 as	 it	 turned	 out,	 and	 although	 Jace	 didn’t	 eat	 all	 of	 it,	 or	 even anything	close,	I	did	catch	him	popping	quite	a	few	kernels	into	his	mouth	as	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">worked	 at	 making	 his	 own	 strings	 to	 decorate	 the	 tree.	 It	 was	 so	 lovely	 being there	 with	 him	 in	 the	 living	 room,	 a	 fire	 blazing	 away	 in	 the	 hearth,	 candles burning	on	the	tables	and	on	the	mantelpiece	of	twisted	juniper,	that	I	couldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">even	 get	 angry	 about	 the	 way	 a	 good	 portion	 of	 the	 popcorn	 in	 his	 bowl	 was going	into	his	mouth	rather	than	onto	the	thread	he	held.	Then	again,	maybe	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	something	to	do	with	the	half	bottle	of	wine	we’d	brought	out	here	with	us</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	we	were	done	eating	dinner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Either	way,	I	was	feeling	more	than	a	little	mellow	as	we	hung	the	popcorn</p>
<p class="calibre1">strings	on	the	tree,	then	topped	it	with	a	five-pointed	star	that	Jace	had	fashioned out	of	aluminum	foil	and	tied	on	with	some	extra	thread. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	want	to	make	a	wish,”	I	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that	a	tradition?”	he	asked.	“To	make	a	wish	when	you	put	the	star	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tree?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	if	it	was	for	everyone.	But	we	always	did	it	in	my	family.”	A</p>
<p class="calibre1">flicker	of	sadness	went	over	me	then	as	I	thought	of	all	those	family	Christmases</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	 I	 was	 younger,	 the	 wrapping	 paper	 strewn	 everywhere,	 hot	 cocoa	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p189"></a>Devin	 and	 me	 and	 coffee	 for	 my	 parents.	 Regret,	 too,	 that	 they’d	 never	 get	 to meet	Jace.	I	had	a	feeling	they	would	have	liked	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,”	he	said.	“What’s	your	wish?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 many	 I	 could	 have	 made	 —	 that	 the	 world	 would	 somehow	 heal	 itself, that	the	Dying	had	never	happened.	Those	things	were	out	of	my	hands,	though, </p>
<p class="calibre1">so	I	wished	for	the	one	thing	I	truly	wanted	that	was	reasonable.	“I	wish	that	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	always	be	like	this	—	the	two	of	us	here,	together.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	glow	touched	his	dark	eyes,	a	glow	that	had	nothing	to	do	with	the	flicker</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	fireplace	or	the	gleam	of	the	candles	all	around	us.	“I	think	I	can	make	that wish	come	true.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 moved	 close,	 pulling	 me	 into	 his	 arms,	 and	 then	 he	 was	 kissing	 me, mouth	 warm,	 lips	 insistent	 against	 mine.	 Just	 like	 the	 first	 time	 we’d	 kissed,	 I could	 taste	 the	 wine	 on	 his	 tongue,	 and	 heat	 flamed	 through	 me,	 awakening	 a deep	 throbbing	 in	 my	 core.	 I	 knew	 this	 was	 one	 night	 when	 we	 wouldn’t	 fall asleep	exhausted	without	touching	one	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No,	 we	 were	 hurrying	 down	 the	 hallway	 to	 the	 bedroom,	 laughing	 at	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">chilly	air,	Jace	fumbling	with	the	logs	so	he	could	get	the	fire	going. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	should	have	come	in	here	right	after	dinner	like	you	were	supposed	to,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	teased	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 would	 have,	 except	 someone	 insisted	 I	 come	 with	 her	 to	 make	 popcorn strings.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	right.	Well,	I	hope	that	won’t	take	you	 <i class="calibre3">too</i>	long.”	I	pulled	the	sweater	I wore	over	my	head,	followed	by	the	long-sleeved	T-shirt	I	had	on	underneath.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	cold	enough	that	I	broke	out	in	goose	bumps,	but	I	wouldn’t	let	that	stop	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	Jace	was	busy	with	the	lighter,	his	back	to	me,	I	took	off	my	boots,	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">stepped	 out	 of	 my	 jeans.	 All	 that	 remained	 were	 my	 socks	 and	 my	 bra	 and panties,	and	I	made	short	work	of	those. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 he	 turned	 around,	 his	 mouth	 dropped	 slightly.	 “Damn,	 Jessica.”	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">took	in	a	breath,	then	added,	his	voice	husky,	“You	are	so	beautiful.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heat	went	over	me,	despite	how	cold	it	was	in	the	room.	“Th-thanks,”	I	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 teeth	 chattering	 slightly.	 “Now	 come	 over	 here	 so	 I	 can	 tell	 you	 the	 same thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 across	 the	 room	 in	 a	 flash,	 my	 fingers	 working	 the	 buttons	 of	 his flannel	 shirt	 while	 he	 undid	 his	 belt	 buckle	 and	 then	 the	 buttons	 of	 his	 Levi’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh,	 how	 I	 loved	 the	 smooth,	 heavy	 muscles	 of	 his	 chest,	 his	 flat	 stomach.	 If anything,	he’d	gotten	bigger	and	harder	during	his	months	here,	probably	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	the	manual	labor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Speaking	of	bigger	and	harder…. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 sank	 to	 my	 knees,	 stroking	 him,	 and	 then	 brought	 him	 into	 my	 mouth, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p190"></a>tasting	 salt	 and	 a	 faint,	 faint	 musk.	 He	 moaned	 and	 tipped	 his	 head	 back,	 his fingers	 tightening	 on	 my	 shoulders.	 “Man,	 Jessica,”	 he	 breathed.	 “I’ll	 have	 to remember	to	bring	you	Christmas	trees	more	often.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chuckling,	I	continued	to	move	my	hand	up	and	down	his	shaft,	my	tongue</p>
<p class="calibre1">swiping	over	him.	After	that,	he	didn’t	seem	capable	of	speech,	only	continued</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 hold	 on	 to	 me,	 until	 he	 pulled	 himself	 from	 my	 mouth	 and	 raised	 me	 to	 my feet,	then	pushed	me	down	on	the	bed,	his	hands	warm	on	my	ass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	didn’t	have	sex	in	this	position	very	often,	but	I	loved	it	when	we	did.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">pushed	into	me,	hands	shifting	slightly	so	they	were	wrapped	around	my	hips	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 rocked	 against	 me,	 in	 me,	 and	 I	 gasped,	 my	 own	 palms	 flat	 on	 the	 bed	 as	 I took	him	in,	took	all	of	him,	pushing	deeper,	stronger,	until	I	felt	the	throbbing warmth	growing	within	me	and	knew	I	was	close…so	close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	was	Jace,	because	I	felt	him	clench,	then	cry	out,	and	as	he	released,	I	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	as	well,	my	body	clamping	down	on	him,	pulsing,	squeezing.	I	gasped.	“Oh, </p>
<p class="calibre1">God,	Jace….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 was	 about	 all	 I	 could	 manage	 before	 I	 collapsed	 on	 the	 bed.	 He	 slid down	 next	 to	 me,	 his	 chest	 heaving,	 and	 then	 pulled	 me	 against	 him.	 How perfect	 the	 warmth	 of	 his	 skin,	 the	 way	 our	 bodies	 fit	 together.	 We	 held	 each other	in	silence	like	that	for	a	few	moments,	and	then	he	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Happy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	even	have	to	stop	to	think.	“I’ve	never	been	this	happy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	kissed	me	then,	not	fiercely	as	he	had	before,	but	with	a	touch	of	his	lips</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	my	skin	as	soft	as	a	snowflake	settling	there.	“That’s	all	I’ve	ever	wanted.	To make	you	happy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because	I	could	already	feel	myself	slipping	into	sleep,	I	didn’t	really	stop	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">puzzle	 that	 out,	 how	 he	 could’ve	 always	 wanted	 such	 a	 thing	 when	 we’d	 only known	each	other	for	less	than	two	months.	Instead,	I	cradled	my	head	against</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	chest,	and	let	myself	drift	into	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p191"></a><img src="index-191_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="index-191_2.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">SEVENTEEN</p>
<p class="calibre1">Voices	in	the	darkness	woke	me.	I	blinked	and	sat	up,	holding	myself	still	for	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">second	or	two,	since	the	room	wanted	to	spin	around	me.	For	some	reason,	I	felt</p>
<p class="calibre1">positively	thick-headed,	like	the	one	time	in	college	I’d	tried	an	over-the-counter sleep	aid	because	I	was	stressed	from	exams	and	the	breakup	with	Colin,	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 having	 a	 hard	 time	 falling	 asleep.	 That	 didn’t	 make	 sense,	 though,	 since	 I hadn’t	 had	 anything	 more	 than	 a	 glass	 of	 wine	 with	 dinner,	 and	 another	 one while	we	were	in	the	living	room,	making	popcorn	strings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instinctively,	 I	 reached	 to	 my	 right,	 where	 Jace	 should	 have	 been	 sleeping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 the	 bed	 was	 empty,	 although	 I	 knew	 we	 couldn’t	 have	 been	 asleep	 for	 too long,	as	the	fire	was	still	burning	brightly.	Dutchie	was	passed	out	in	front	of	it, nose	and	tail	almost	touching,	her	heavy	breaths	not	quite	a	snore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	again	I	heard	that	strange	murmur,	and	I	sat	very	still,	ears	straining	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	 out	 individual	 words.	 But	 the	 voices	 were	 far	 enough	 off	 that	 I	 couldn’t catch	 anything,	 although	 one	 of	 them	 sounded	 like	 it	 could	 be	 Jace.	 Had	 he gotten	 up	 and	 tested	 the	 radio,	 and	 this	 time	 actually	 made	 contact	 with someone?	I	would	have	thought	he’d	come	and	wake	me	up	for	something	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">momentous,	but	maybe	he’d	thought	it	best	to	let	me	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 blinked,	 fighting	 off	 the	 last	 of	 that	 strange	 drowsiness,	 pushed	 back	 the covers,	retrieved	my	panties	from	where	they	were	lying	on	the	floor,	and	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">went	to	the	closet	to	get	my	flannel	sleep	shirt	and	thick	robe.	Yes,	lying	naked</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p192"></a>next	to	each	other	was	very	romantic,	but	by	the	time	4	a.m.	rolled	around,	it	was also	 damn	 cold.	 Luckily,	 Jace	 didn’t	 seem	 to	 mind	 the	 sleep	 shirt,	 which	 was covered	in	penguins.	One	time	he	even	told	me	he	thought	it	was	cute.	He	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	been	lying,	but	I	think	it	was	more	that	he	wanted	me	to	know	he	thought	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	sexy	no	matter	what	I	might	be	wearing	to	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	tied	the	robe	around	me,	I	went	to	the	doorway,	then	paused.	The	voices</p>
<p class="calibre1">should	 have	 been	 coming	 from	 my	 right,	 down	 the	 hall	 in	 the	 direction	 of	 the office.	But	they	weren’t	—	instead,	they	seemed	to	originate	in	the	living	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 didn’t	 make	 any	 sense.	 Even	 if	 the	 unthinkable	 had	 happened	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	survivor	had	shown	up	on	our	doorstep,	I	should	have	heard	something, </p>
<p class="calibre1">no	matter	how	deeply	asleep	I	was.	If	nothing	else,	Dutchie	would	have	barked</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	head	off.	But	she	was	passed	out	on	the	floor	of	the	bedroom,	so	conked	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	like	someone	had	drugged	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Frowning,	 I	 slipped	 out	 into	 the	 corridor,	 the	 tile	 floor	 icy	 against	 my	 bare feet.	It	wasn’t	quite	pitch	dark,	since,	in	our	rush	to	get	to	the	bedroom,	Jace	and I	 had	 left	 the	 pillar	 candles	 burning	 on	 the	 coffee	 table	 and	 on	 the	 mantel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because	of	that,	as	I	approached	I	could	make	out	clearly	enough	who	was	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">living	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only…my	brain	couldn’t	quite	grasp	what	it	was	seeing.	Two	men.	At	least, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 looked	 like	 men,	 but…they	 couldn’t	 be.	 Not	 hovering	 in	 midair, </p>
<p class="calibre1">approximately	a	foot	and	a	half	above	the	floor,	as	if	they	had	no	need	of	solid</p>
<p class="calibre1">ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	them	was	Jace.	Or	rather,	he	resembled	Jace,	except	somehow	older</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	harder,	his	jaw	and	eyes	stern.	His	hair	seemed	longer	than	its	current	inch</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 so	 below	 shoulder	 length,	 almost	 as	 long	 as	 mine,	 and	 floated	 around	 him, appearing	 to	 wave	 in	 an	 unseen	 wind,	 a	 wind	 that	 stirred	 the	 branches	 of	 the Christmas	 tree	 and	 made	 all	 the	 flames	 in	 the	 pillar	 candles	 on	 the	 mantel	 and coffee	table	dance	and	sway.	Just	as	when	he’d	fallen	asleep,	his	chest	and	arms</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	bare,	but	now	thick	cuffs	of	silvery-blue	metal	surrounded	his	wrists,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	wore	full-legged	pants	made	of	a	shimmering	dark	blue	fabric,	possibly	silk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 other	 man…or	 whatever	 he	 was…stood	 in	 profile	 to	 me,	 so	 I	 couldn’t get	 all	 that	 good	 a	 look	 at	 him.	 And	 actually,	 I	 wasn’t	 sure	 I	 wanted	 to.	 There was	something	cruel	in	his	hawkish	profile,	in	the	set	of	his	jaw	and	mouth.	His</p>
<p class="calibre1">hair	 was	 pulled	 back	 into	 a	 severe	 ponytail	 and	 banded	 with	 reddish	 metal	 —</p>
<p class="calibre1">copper,	maybe,	or	even	rose	gold.	More	reddish	metal	gleamed	at	his	wrists,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	pants,	similar	in	construction	to	the	ones	Jace	wore,	were	a	dark	burnt-umber</p>
<p class="calibre1">sort	of	shade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stranger	than	his	presence,	and	even	stranger	than	the	way	he	floated	above</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 floor,	 however,	 was	 the	 way	 odd	 little	 flames	 seemed	 to	 dance	 around	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p193"></a>feet	and	swirl	in	the	air	directly	above	his	head,	as	if	he	were	somehow	made	of fire,	and	had	only	taken	on	physical	form	so	he	could	have	this	conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	flattened	myself	against	the	wall,	glad	of	my	bare	feet,	which	had	made	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">sound	 as	 I	 approached,	 and	 the	 relative	 darkness	 of	 the	 hallway	 where	 I	 hid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace…that	oddly	altered	Jace…and	the	stranger	would	have	had	to	look	directly</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	me	to	see	me	at	all,	and	it	seemed	clear	enough	that	they	were	occupied	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	another,	not	sparing	a	glance	for	the	supposedly	sleeping	house	around	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“…wasted	enough	time	here	already,”	the	stranger	was	saying.	His	voice	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">deeper	 than	 Jace’s,	 harsh,	 and	 something	 about	 it	 made	 chills	 go	 up	 and	 down my	spine.	“It	is	time	to	come	join	the	rest	of	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Surely	 a	 few	 days	 more	 won’t	 matter,”	 Jace	 replied.	 “After	 Christmas	 has passed	—	” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	stranger	made	a	sound	of	disgust.	“Christmas?	What	foolishness	is	this? </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 day	 means	 nothing	 to	 us,	 and	 you	 have	 coddled	 the	 woman	 long	 enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tell	her	the	truth,	or	as	much	of	it	as	you	deem	necessary,	but	we	will	not	wait</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	longer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	the	rush?”	Jace	crossed	his	arms	and	stared	directly	into	the	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">man’s	eyes,	something	I	didn’t	think	I’d	have	had	the	courage	to	do.	“What	does</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	matter	if	we	wait	out	the	winter	here,	and	then	come	to	you	in	the	spring?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	the	briefest	second,	the	stranger	hesitated,	his	hands	tightening	into	fists</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	his	sides,	even	as	the	flames	dancing	around	his	feet	and	above	his	head	flared brighter,	 shifting	 from	 warm	 orange	 to	 an	 acid	 yellow.	 From	 annoyance…or something	else?	“Because	it	may	not	be	safe	to	do	so.	We	are	disturbed	by	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 developments	 among	 the	 Immune.	 They’ve	 gathered	 in	 a	 place	 not	 far from	 here,	 and	 although	 we	 do	 not	 know	 how	 they	 are	 managing	 it,	 they	 are blocking	 us	 from	 scrying	 them,	 or	 indeed	 from	 coming	 within	 miles	 of	 their compound	so	we	might	finish	them	off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">“The	Immune”? </i>	I	thought.  <i class="calibre3">Other	survivors?	And	what	the	hell	does	he	mean</i> <i class="calibre3">by	“finish	them	off”? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 is	 troubling,”	 Jace	 said,	 and	 it	 seemed	 the	 unseen	 wind	 that	 swirled around	him	gained	in	force,	wildly	blowing	at	his	hair	and	causing	the	flames	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">several	of	the	candles	to	almost	snuff	themselves.	“No	one	has	been	able	to	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">close?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	There	is	one	road	in	and	one	road	out,	both	heavily	guarded.	Several	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Chosen	volunteered	to	investigate,	since	they	would	be	able	to	get	far	closer</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 Immune	 than	 we	 would,	 but	 we	 have	 had	 no	 contact	 with	 any	 of	 them since,	and	it	is	feared	they	have	been	lost.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	hard	for	me	to	tell	for	certain,	but	it	almost	seemed	as	if	Jace	winced</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	he	received	that	particular	piece	of	information,	as	if	it	was	more	painful	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p194"></a>him	than	the	rest	of	what	he	had	just	heard.	“That	is	a	grievous	loss.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	stranger	shrugged.	Clearly,	he	was	not	overly	concerned	about	the	loss</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 these	 “Chosen,”	 whoever	 they	 might	 be.	 “They	 volunteered	 for	 the	 mission. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	partners	will	find	replacements,	if	they	wish.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	 the	 set	 of	 his	 shoulders,	 it	 appeared	 that	 Jace	 wasn’t	 quite	 so	 blithe about	 the	 fate	 of	 the	 Chosen	 who	 had	 disappeared.	 “How	 long	 has	 it	 been? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps	you	are	not	giving	them	enough	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Two	 weeks,	 as	 such	 things	 are	 counted	 here.	 Time	 enough.”	 The	 stranger straightened,	his	eyes	on	a	level	with	Jace’s.	“I	am	telling	you	this	because	your safety	here	is	not	guaranteed.	Better	for	you	to	be	with	the	rest	of	us.”	Then	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">paused,	 and	 my	 heart	 seemed	 to	 stop	 in	 my	 chest	 as	 he	 glanced	 over	 in	 my direction.	“Your	paramour	is	awake.	It	seems	she	was	not	quite	as	deeply	asleep</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	you	thought.	You	will	have	some	explaining	to	do,	I	think.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	appeared	to	be	his	parting	shot,	because	after	he	made	that	remark,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">flames	which	had	been	licking	at	his	feet	seemed	to	grow	and	swell,	rising	until</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	engulfed	him.	Then	they	went	out,	and	Jace	was	alone	in	the	living	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyes	met	mine,	and	I	saw	him	draw	in	a	breath,	then	lower	himself	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">floor.	As	he	did	so,	his	appearance	shifted	back	to	the	Jace	I	knew…or	thought	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew.	 At	 the	 same	 time,	 the	 lamp	 in	 the	 corner	 of	 the	 room	 flared	 to	 life, although	neither	of	us	had	touched	a	light	switch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jessica,”	 he	 said,	 his	 arms	 reaching	 out	 to	 me	 as	 he	 began	 to	 move	 in	 my direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t,”	I	retorted,	still	hugging	the	wall.	“Stay	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stopped	at	once,	but	I	could	see	the	pleading	in	his	dark	eyes.	“Jessica,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	explain	—	” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 you’d	 better	 explain.”	 The	 cool	 plaster	 of	 the	 wall	 against	 my	 back gave	me	a	little	courage.	At	least	this	way,	he’d	have	to	face	me,	couldn’t	sneak</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	on	me	from	behind.	“Who	—	 <i class="calibre3">what</i>	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	shoulders	seemed	to	droop	then.	He	looked	so	pitiful	that,	under	normal</p>
<p class="calibre1">circumstances,	I	would	have	gone	to	him	at	once	and	put	my	arms	around	him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">attempted	to	comfort	him.	But	there	would	be	no	comfort	here.	Not	after	what	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	just	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please,	come	and	sit	down,”	he	said.	“We	must	have	this	conversation,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	don’t	need	to	have	it	like	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	shook	my	head.	“I	don’t	think	that’s	such	a	good	idea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jessica.”	 This	 time	 he	 sounded	 different,	 his	 voice	 deeper,	 the	 way	 it	 had been	when	he	was	speaking	with	that	—	whoever	he	was.	At	the	same	time,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">backed	off,	going	to	sit	down	on	the	couch.	“Look.	Here	I	am.	You	can	sit	in	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">chair.	I	promise	I	won’t	move	unless	you	say	it’s	all	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p195"></a>For	 a	 second	 or	 two,	 I	 didn’t	 do	 anything,	 only	 watched	 him	 through narrowed	eyes.	He	was	sitting	there	quietly,	his	hands	planted	on	his	knees.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">certainly	didn’t	look	as	if	he	intended	to	launch	at	me,	but	how	could	I	trust	him when	it	was	clear	he	was	definitely	not	who	he	had	pretended	to	be? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 again,	 I	 did	 want	 answers,	 and	 if	 he	 might	 be	 more	 inclined	 to	 give them	if	I	sat	down	as	he’d	asked,	then	that	seemed	to	be	what	I	should	do.	Not</p>
<p class="calibre1">taking	my	eyes	off	him,	I	crossed	over	to	the	chair	and	sank	into	it.	Actually,	that did	 feel	 a	 bit	 better,	 although	 the	 spurious	 sensation	 of	 relief	 could	 have	 had something	to	do	with	the	rug	under	my	bare,	icy	feet	and	the	warmth	of	the	fire</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	it	reached	out	to	heat	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 pulled	 in	 a	 breath.	 “So…this	 you	 I’m	 looking	 at	 right	 now.	 Is	 it	 the	 real you,	or	the	other	one?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 answer,	 his	 features	 seemed	 to	 shift	 and	 harden,	 becoming	 those	 of	 the man	I’d	seen	floating	above	the	floor	a	few	minutes	earlier.	Still	handsome…in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">way,	 more	 handsome,	 because	 those	 features	 had	 somehow	 become	 more</p>
<p class="calibre1">chiseled,	more	refined,	even	though	he	was	recognizable	as	the	Jace	I’d	thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	known.	“This	is	my	true	aspect,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Right	then,	I	wasn’t	sure	which	was	upsetting	me	more	—	knowing	that	Jace</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t	real,	was	some	sort	of	disguise	worn	by	this…being	—	or	the	casual	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	flipped	from	one	appearance	to	the	other.	I	tightened	my	fingers	on	my	knees, </p>
<p class="calibre1">feeling	the	soft	nap	of	the	robe	I	wore	and	realizing	that	now	it	was	giving	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">absolutely	no	comfort.	“And	your	true	name?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jasreel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	he	was	still	Jace,	in	a	way…although	I	doubted	I’d	ever	feel	comfortable</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough	 to	 call	 him	 that	 again.	 The	 thought	 made	 incongruous	 tears	 sting	 my eyes,	and	I	swallowed.	Could	I	mourn	the	loss	of	something	I’d	never	truly	had? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe,	at	some	point.	Right	then,	I	had	to	man	up	and	get	some	answers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	 what	 are	 you?”	 I	 asked,	 my	 voice	 deliberately	 hard.	 “Some	 kind	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">demon…angel…what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Neither.”	He	reached	up	to	touch	the	smooth	stone	he	wore	around	his	neck, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 I	 wondered	 then	 if	 it	 was	 some	 sort	 of	 talisman,	 rather	 than	 the	 simple souvenir	I’d	thought	it	must	be.	“I	am	a	djinn.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	blinked	at	him.	“What,	you	mean	like	 <i class="calibre3">I	Dream	of	Jeannie</i>,	and	the	big	blue guy	in	the	lamp	from	 <i class="calibre3">Aladdin</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 mouth	 tightened.	 “Not	 like	 that	 at	 all,	 even	 though	 your	 people	 have simplified	the	idea	of	the	djinn	to	something	as	foolish	as	a	being	who	can	grant</p>
<p class="calibre1">wishes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	you	don’t	grant	wishes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	called	by	a	powerful	enough	magician,	perhaps.	But	we	do	not	enjoy</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p196"></a>the	process	and	will	do	whatever	we	can	do	free	ourselves	from	such	bonds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Okay.	First	djinn…and	now	magicians?	My	head	was	spinning.	“All	right,	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re	 a	 djinn.	 I	 can’t	 really	 deny	 that,	 not	 when	 I	 saw	 you	 floating	 two	 feet above	the	floor	and	watched	your	friend	vanish	in	a	puff	of	smoke.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jace’s… <i class="calibre3">Jasreel’s</i>…brows	 drew	 together.	 “He	 is	 not	 my	 friend,	 not	 in	 any way	you	would	understand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 decided	 to	 let	 it	 go	 for	 now.	 That	 other	 djinn	 had	 seemed	 like	 a	 nasty customer	anyway.	There	was	a	far	more	important	question	I	wanted	to	ask.	“All</p>
<p class="calibre1">right,	then… <i class="calibre3">why? </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 long,	 long	 silence.	 He	 stared	 at	 me,	 dark	 eyes	 sorrowful.	 “You	 should know… <i class="calibre3">beloved</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	single	vein	in	my	body	seemed	to	be	filled	with	ice.	I	tried	to	draw	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">breath,	 but	 it	 got	 caught	 somewhere	 in	 my	 throat,	 choking	 me.	 I	 stared	 at	 him, then	finally	forced	the	words	out.	“That	was	you?	The	voice	was	 <i class="calibre3">you? </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	 he	 said	 simply.	 “I	 had	 chosen	 you,	 and	 so	 I	 would	 do	 whatever	 was necessary	to	keep	you	safe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	my	mind’s	eye,	I	saw	Chris	Bowman’s	limp	body	being	thrown	across	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">yard	as	if	it	had	been	made	of	rags,	saw	a	bullet	stop	an	inch	away	from	my	face, </p>
<p class="calibre1">then	bounce	harmlessly	off	some	invisible	shield.	Yes,	this	Jasreel	had	been	there all	 along,	 watching	 over	 me,	 then	 leading	 me	 here.	 But	 for	 what	 purpose?	 I found	it	hard	to	believe	that	some	sort	of	supernatural,	supremely	powerful	being</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	go	to	all	that	trouble	just	for	a	little	booty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	word,”	I	said.	“<i class="calibre3">Chosen</i>.	I	heard	your	visitor	mention	it,	too.	What	does it	mean,	really?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jasreel	stared	at	me	with	those	sad,	sad	eyes.	How	could	I	be	terrified	of	him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 angry	 with	 him…and	 yet	 still	 want	 to	 reach	 out	 to	 comfort	 him?	 No,	 that was	crazy.	Bad	enough	that	only	a	few	hours	earlier	we’d	—</p>
<p class="calibre1">My	brain	shut	down	that	line	of	thought	with	an	almost	audible	 <i class="calibre3">click</i>.	I	could not	let	myself	think	about	that,	or	I	really	would	go	mad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	will	be	difficult	to	hear,”	he	said	quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	it’ll	be	even	more	difficult	for	me	not	to	know	the	truth,”	I	replied.	“So</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	fingers	clenched	on	his	knees.	For	the	first	time,	I	noticed	that	although</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	face	and	body	had	shifted	to	those	of	what	he	called	his	true	self,	he	wasn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">wearing	 those	 silk	 pantaloon	 things,	 but	 a	 pair	 of	 flannel	 pajama	 bottoms	 he routinely	 wore	 to	 bed	 when	 he	 was	 pretending	 to	 be	 “Jace.”	 The	 contrast	 was jarring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 he	 said,	 “This	 world	 was	 ours	 once,	 uncounted	 ages	 ago.	 When	 God</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	man,	He	—	” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p197"></a>“Wait,	what?”	I	broke	in.	“God?	Like,  <i class="calibre3">the</i>	God?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,  <i class="calibre3">the</i>	God.”	This	was	accompanied	by	a	flicker	of	a	smile,	but	Jasreel’s expression	sobered	quickly	enough	afterward.	“When	God	made	man,	the	djinn</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	cast	out,	and	this	world	given	over	to	mankind.	We	are	not	flesh	precisely</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	you	understand	it,	although	we	can	make	ourselves	corporeal	as	it	suits	us.	We</p>
<p class="calibre1">spent	long	ages	in	exile,	only	coming	to	this	world	when	summoned,	or	during</p>
<p class="calibre1">brief	 stolen	 moments.	 During	 that	 time,	 the	 world	 changed	 a	 good	 deal,	 and mankind	 along	 with	 it.	 We	 watched	 from	 our	 exile,	 saw	 how	 you	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">destroying	this	gift	you	were	given.	And	so,	among	certain	quarters,	the	decision</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	made	to	take	back	that	which	had	been	stolen	from	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 did	 not	 sound	 good	 at	 all.	 I	 pulled	 my	 robe	 more	 tightly	 around	 me, although	 I	 didn’t	 think	 that	 was	 going	 to	 do	 much	 to	 combat	 the	 chill	 which seemed	to	be	creeping	through	every	limb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Many	years	were	given	over	to	the	task,	but	at	last	the	means	of	mankind’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">destruction	 was	 perfected	 —	 an	 illness	 so	 grave	 that	 it	 would	 take	 almost	 the entire	population	of	the	earth	with	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	—	 <i class="calibre3">you</i>	did	that?”	I	demanded,	sour	bile	churning	in	my	stomach	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	 that	 this	 —	  <i class="calibre3">thing</i>	 —	 had	 been	 behind	 the	 death	 and	 destruction	 of everyone	and	everything	I	had	cared	about.	I	got	to	my	feet,	not	even	thinking, </p>
<p class="calibre1">just	knowing	I	had	to	get	away	from	him,	had	to	run	—</p>
<p class="calibre1">But	he’d	risen	as	well,	his	hand	clamping	on	my	arm	like	iron,	preventing	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	fleeing.	“No,  <i class="calibre3">I</i>	did	not	do	that.	There	were	those	of	us	who	protested,	who said	 we	 could	 not	 support	 such	 a	 vile	 act.	 We	 were	 outnumbered,	 though, overruled.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 fingers	 felt	 as	 if	 they	 were	 burning	 into	 my	 flesh.	 “Let	 go	 of	 me,”	 I gritted	from	between	clenched	teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	 my	 surprise,	 he	 did	 release	 me,	 raising	 his	 hands	 as	 if	 in	 surrender. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jessica,	I	am	sorry.	The	only	compromise	we	were	allowed	was	that	those	of	us</p>
<p class="calibre1">who	 did	 not	 support	 such	 extreme	 measures	 would	 be	 able	 to	 choose	 from among	 the	 Immune,	 to	 find	 someone	 who	 would	 be	 under	 our	 protection,	 who would	not	be	subject	to	the	final	purge.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Final	purge’?”	I	echoed,	my	stomach	clenching	once	again.	Just	when	I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	it	couldn’t	get	any	worse.	“What	are	you	talking	about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pulled	in	a	breath,	although	I	noticed	he	kept	his	gaze	fixed	on	my	face</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	didn’t	try	to	look	away.	“Those	who	created	the	virus	knew	that	no	illness</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	have	a	perfect	mortality	rate.	There	are	now	perhaps	two	million	people</p>
<p class="calibre1">left	 alive,	 scattered	 across	 the	 face	 of	 the	 planet.	 And	 so	 the	 next	 task	 is	 to eradicate	the	Immune,	leaving	behind	only	the	Chosen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	so	awful	that	I	truly	couldn’t	begin	to	comprehend	the	scope	of	what</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p198"></a>he	was	telling	me.	Two	million	out	of	seven	billion	seemed	like	a	paltry	number, but	 obviously	 the	 djinn	 in	 charge	 wouldn’t	 be	 satisfied	 with	 even	 that	 many human	beings	left	alive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	legs	gave	way,	and	I	slumped	back	down	into	my	chair.	“How	many?”	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">asked.	“How	many	Chosen?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	thousand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	thousand	people,	out	of	two	million.	All	those	who’d	thought	they	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">survived	 the	 worst,	 who	 even	 now	 were	 struggling	 to	 pick	 up	 the	 pieces	 of	 a world	that	had	utterly	fallen	apart…they	would	have	all	that	stolen	from	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 will	 happen	 to	 the	 Immune?”	 I	 asked.	 I	 wasn’t	 sure	 where	 those</p>
<p class="calibre1">words	 had	 come	 from.	 It	 wasn’t	 as	 if	 I’d	 consciously	 decided	 to	 ask	 that question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jasreel	 sat	 down	 as	 well,	 expression	 troubled.	 In	 a	 way,	 I	 was	 surprised	 I could	read	his	face	so	easily,	since	he	wasn’t	even	human.	But	he	looked	human</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough	at	the	moment,	and	he’d	certainly	done	a	good	job	of	fooling	me	these</p>
<p class="calibre1">past	few	months. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	will	be	hunted	down,”	he	said	at	last.	“As	one	of	the	dissenters,	I	am</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	privy	to	exactly	how	and	why,	and	truly,	I	don’t	wish	to	know.	I	cannot	stop</p>
<p class="calibre1">it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	really	that	powerless?	How	many	dissenters	are	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	 many	 as	 there	 are	 Chosen.	 One	 thousand.	 The	 djinn	 do	 not	 number</p>
<p class="calibre1">anywhere	near	what	mankind	once	did,	but	there	are	still	some	twenty	thousand</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 my	 people,	 far	 too	 many	 for	 any	 of	 us	 dissenters	 to	 even	 contemplate confronting	them.”	He	sent	me	an	imploring	look	then,	as	if	pleading	for	me	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand.	 “Jessica,	 we	 did	 everything	 we	 could	 to	 stop	 this	 thing	 from happening.	It	was	beyond	our	power.	All	we	could	do	was	save	that	chosen	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">thousand	of	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 protests	 died	 on	 my	 lips	 then.	 Yes,	 he	 had	 lied	 about	 who	 and	 what	 he was,	but	this	Jasreel	had	been	by	my	side	for	the	better	part	of	two	months	now, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 I	 saw	 nothing	 in	 his	 face	 in	 that	 moment	 but	 regret	 and	 sorrow.	 Whatever horrors	his	people	had	perpetrated,	he’d	wanted	nothing	to	do	with	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Which	 left	 only	 one	 question.	 “Then…why	 me?	 Why	 did	 you	 choose	 me? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	no	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	off	the	couch	and	on	his	knees	in	one	fluid	movement.	So	close,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet	 I	 noticed	 he	 didn’t	 try	 to	 reach	 out	 and	 touch	 me.	 He	 wouldn’t,	 I	 realized then,	unless	I	told	him	it	was	all	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether	or	not	that	would	happen…even	I	didn’t	know	for	sure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	voice	was	pitched	low,	but	no	less	intense	for	all	that.	“Beloved,	you	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 <i class="calibre3">no	one</i>.	I	recognized	your	beauty	and	your	strength,	and	I	knew	you	were	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p199"></a>choice	of	my	heart,	even	out	of	several	million	survivors.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	 was	 I	 supposed	 to	 say	 in	 response	 to	 such	 a	 declaration?	 I	 stared	 at him,	at	a	face	that	was	like	Jace’s,	but	wasn’t,	at	the	broad	shoulders,	the	arms</p>
<p class="calibre1">thick	 with	 muscle.	 He	 looked	 human,	 and	 yet	 I	 knew	 he	 was	 anything	 but	 a mortal	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please,”	 I	 whispered.	 “Please	 don’t	 call	 me	 that.	 I	 don’t	 —	 I	 don’t	 know what	to	think.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	stillness	settled	on	his	features	in	that	moment,	as	if	he’d	finally	realized</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 I	 wasn’t	 simply	 going	 to	 say,  <i class="calibre3">Oh,	 it’s	 all	 right,	 I	 still	 love	 you,	 too,	 all	 is</i> <i class="calibre3">forgiven</i>.	 He	 glanced	 away	 from	 me,	 over	 at	 the	 fire,	 and	 then	 back.	 “I	 realize this	is	all	difficult	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Difficult’?”	I	repeated.	“I	think	we	passed	difficult	about	ten	minutes	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 pulled	 in	 a	 breath,	 then	 pushed	 the	 chair	 back	 so	 I	 could	 stand	 up	 without bumping	into	him.	“I	just	—	I	need	some	time	to	process	this,	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	didn’t	get	up,	but	remained	there	on	his	knees,	still	staring	up	at	me	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 blank	 expression	 on	 his	 face.	 A	 muscle	 twitched	 in	 his	 cheek	 as	 he	 said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can	have	as	much	time	as	you	need.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.”	I	sidled	away	from	the	chair,	moving	toward	the	hallway.	“And	—</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t	 come	 to	 the	 bedroom.	 Go	 back	 to	 your	 old	 room.	 That	 is,	 if	 djinn	 even need	to	sleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	that	parting	shot,	I	made	my	escape,	all	but	running	to	get	away	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.	Even	so,	I	couldn’t	help	taking	a	quick	backward	glance	as	I	left	the	living</p>
<p class="calibre1">room.	 He	 was	 still	 kneeling	 on	 the	 floor,	 but	 now	 his	 head	 was	 bowed,	 his elbows	 on	 the	 coffee	 table,	 as	 if	 he	 needed	 that	 support	 to	 keep	 himself	 from collapsing	completely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	that	sight,	my	throat	tightened,	and	the	hallway	around	me	blurred,	tears</p>
<p class="calibre1">welling	 to	 my	 eyes	 and	 spilling	 down	 my	 cheeks.	 I	 stumbled	 into	 the	 master suite	 and	 then	 fell	 on	 the	 bed	 —	 the	 bed	 where	 Jace	 had	 made	 love	 to	 me	 so many	 times	 —	 sobs	 tearing	 themselves	 out	 of	 my	 chest.	 I	 didn’t	 even	 know exactly	what	I	was	crying	about.	The	loss	of	what	I	thought	I’d	had	with	Jace? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 realization	 that	 the	 Dying	 had	 come	 about	 not	 because	 of	 some	 horrible accident	of	nature,	but	from	directed,	malevolent	intention?	Or	knowing	that	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dying	 wasn’t	 even	 over,	 and	 that	 the	 survivors,	 the	 Immune,	 would	 soon	 be attacked	by	the	djinn,	and	there	wasn’t	a	damn	thing	I	could	do	about	it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	of	those,	and	so	much	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dutchie	 jumped	 up	 on	 the	 bed	 and	 licked	 my	 face,	 and	 I	 gave	 a	 strangled laugh,	then	pulled	her	close,	burying	my	face	in	her	soft	fur.	No,	ordinarily	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t	allowed	on	the	bed,	but	in	that	moment,	she	knew	I	needed	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 clung	 to	 her	 the	 way	 a	 shipwreck	 survivor	 might	 cling	 to	 a	 life	 preserver, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p200"></a>and	finally	let	sleep	take	me	to	a	place	where	I	could	try	to	forget	all	the	horrors I	had	just	been	told. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p201"></a><img src="index-201_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1"><img src="index-201_2.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">EIGHTEEN</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	stalled	as	long	as	I	could.	I	took	a	shower,	dried	my	hair,	even	put	on	some	lip gloss	and	mascara,	things	I	hadn’t	bothered	with	lately,	not	after	I’d	swiped	some heavy-duty	 lip	 balm	 from	 REI	 on	 our	 one	 foraging	 run	 there.	 But	 all	 the preparation	in	the	world	could	only	take	so	much	time,	and	eventually	I	had	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">emerge	 from	 the	 master	 suite,	 although	 I	 noticed	 that	 Dutchie	 had	 nudged	 the door	open	earlier	and	slipped	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or	maybe	Jasreel	had	let	her	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	my	delaying	tactics,	I	knew	I	wasn’t	ready	to	face	him.	A	cowardly</p>
<p class="calibre1">part	 of	 me	 was	 praying	 that	 he’d	 packed	 up	 and	 left,	 had	 gone	 to	 “join	 the others,”	 as	 the	 strange,	 cruel-looking	 djinn	 had	 told	 him	 to	 do.	 Where	 that supernatural	meet-up	was	supposed	to	take	place,	I	didn’t	know.	I	didn’t	want	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 smell	 of	 coffee	 told	 me	 Jasreel	 was	 still	 here,	 though.	 I	 stopped	 at	 the entrance	 to	 the	 kitchen	 and	 saw	 him	 standing	 at	 the	 counter,	 staring	 out	 at	 the bleak	landscape	beyond	the	false	lushness	of	the	garden.	The	goats	were	already</p>
<p class="calibre1">grazing,	 which	 meant	 he	 must	 have	 gone	 and	 milked	 them,	 taken	 care	 of	 their water,	 then	 let	 them	 out.	 Since	 the	 snow	 from	 the	 last	 storm	 had	 all	 melted	 by then,	 save	 for	 a	 few	 drifts	 directly	 under	 the	 eaves	 of	 the	 house,	 nothing	 was stopping	them	from	cropping	at	the	short,	yellowed	grass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	made	coffee,”	I	said,	my	tone	flat. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p202"></a>“I	thought	you	could	use	some.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	noticed	he	was	wearing	Jace’s	clothes	—	flannel	shirt,	faded	Levi’s,	worn</p>
<p class="calibre1">boots	 —	 and	 yet	 they	 couldn’t	 really	 be	 Jace’s	 clothes.	 This	 Jasreel	 was	 just enough	 bigger,	 more	 muscled,	 that	 dressing	 him	 would	 require	 a	 whole	 new wardrobe.	 No,	 these	 had	 to	 be	 counterfeits,	 copies,	 garments	 designed	 to	 look like	what	I	was	used	to	seeing	him	wear	and	therefore	intended	to	put	me	at	ease, </p>
<p class="calibre1">when	in	fact	they	were	doing	the	exact	opposite.	His	hair	was	pulled	back	into	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">ponytail,	and	although	his	expression	was	serene	enough	this	morning,	his	eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	 shadowed.	 So	 could	 djinn	 suffer	 from	 sleepless	 nights,	 or	 was	 this	 his attempt	at	evoking	some	kind	of	pity	in	me? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Normally,	I	would	have	said	thank	you.	This	morning,	though,	I	went	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cupboard	 in	 silence,	 got	 out	 a	 mug,	 and	 poured	 myself	 a	 cup.	 Getting	 some goat’s	milk	and	a	smidgen	of	sugar	to	leaven	it	used	up	some	more	time,	a	few</p>
<p class="calibre1">minutes	where	I	didn’t	have	to	say	anything.	I	could	feel	Jasreel’s	eyes	on	me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">watching	every	movement	I	made,	and	I	didn’t	like	it	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	last	I	turned	around	and	made	myself	face	him,	although	it	was	one	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">harder	 things	 I’d	 done.	 Now,	 in	 the	 morning	 light,	 I	 could	 see	 more	 of	 those differences,	see	how	his	brows	were	just	slightly	more	arched,	his	jaw	just	a	little more	square.	There	were	faint	laugh	lines	around	the	dark,	dark	eyes,	although</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 were	 the	 same,	 nearly	 black,	 and	 still	 circled	 by	 the	 kind	 of	 lashes	 most women	would	kill	for. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	 are	 you	 still	 here?”	 I	 asked	 abruptly,	 my	 fingers	 circled	 around	 the coffee	mug	I	held,	desperately	trying	to	claim	some	of	its	warmth.	My	hands	felt</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	icy	as	the	world	outside	the	kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	question	seemed	to	surprise	him.	His	eyebrows	lifted,	and	he	said,	“You</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t	tell	me	to	leave.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 right,	 I	 hadn’t,	 in	 so	 many	 words.	 I’d	 said	 he	 could	 go	 back	 to	 his	 old bedroom,	 which	 in	 his	 mind	 seemed	 to	 have	 been	 an	 open-ended	 invitation	 to stay.	Last	night,	I	hadn’t	exactly	been	thinking	all	that	clearly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	voice	lowered.	“Do	you	want	me	to	leave?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Did	 I?	 Rationally,	 I	 knew	 I	 should	 have	 ordered	 him	 out	 of	 the	 house	 the night	 before,	 but	 in	 that	 moment,	 all	 I’d	 been	 able	 to	 think	 about	 was	 him	 not following	me	to	the	bedroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	—	I	don’t	know,”	I	said	at	last,	then	added,	as	I	saw	hope	flare	in	his	eyes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“that	is,	I	still	have	some	questions	I	want	to	ask.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mouth	 thinning	 to	 a	 compressed	 line,	 he	 nodded.	 “You	 can	 ask	 me</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Maybe, </i>	I	thought,  <i class="calibre3">but	that	doesn’t	mean	I’m	going	to	get	an	answer	I	like. </i>	 I sipped	 some	 coffee,	 letting	 the	 heat	 of	 it	 course	 down	 my	 throat	 and	 begin	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p203"></a>thaw	that	lump	of	ice	at	my	core.	Who	knew	I	could	feel	so	cold,	when	before Jace	had	made	me	so	warm? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jason	Little	River,”	I	said,	bringing	up	something	I’d	been	pondering	while</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	shower.	“Is	he	just	someone	you	made	up,	or	is	he	a	real	person?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 was	 a	 real	 person,”	 Jasreel	 said.	 From	 the	 use	 of	 “was”	 and	 the	 way Jasreel’s	mouth	tightened	as	he	said	it,	I	had	to	assume	that	the	Mr.	Little	River was	 no	 longer	 with	 us.	 “Everything	 I	 told	 you	 about	 me	 was	 true…about	 him, that	is.	He	grew	up	in	Taos,	went	to	the	university	in	Albuquerque,	split	his	time between	 the	 pueblo	 and	 building	 his	 own	 business	 in	 town.	 He	 was	 also</p>
<p class="calibre1">physically	similar	to	me,	and	that	made	it	much	easier	to	hold	the	illusion	of	his appearance	for	extended	periods.”	A	pause	while	Jasreel	drank	some	of	his	own</p>
<p class="calibre1">coffee,	which	I	noticed	was	pure	black.	“Jace”	had	always	taken	milk,	like	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jason	 Little	 River	 died	 two	 days	 after	 the	 Heat	 came	 to	 Taos.	 After	 he	 was gone,	I	took	his	appearance,	and	his	motorcycle,	and	began	the	journey	here	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Santa	Fe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 part	 didn’t	 make	 any	 sense.	 I	 decided	 for	 sanity’s	 sake	 that	 I’d	 leave aside	 the	 part	 where	 Jasreel	 clearly	 knew	 where	 and	 when	 the	 real	 Jason	 was going	 to	 die.	 “His	 motorcycle?	 What	 the	 hell	 for?	 Couldn’t	 you	 have	 just…I don’t	know…materialized	on	my	doorstep?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jasreel	didn’t	smile.	Still	in	that	same	quiet,	intense	voice,	he	said,	“I	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">have,	 but	 that	 journey	 was	 important	 for	 me	 as	 well.	 I	 needed	 some	 time	 to become	 Jason,	 to	 grow	 accustomed	 to	 being	 him.	 Showing	 up	 weary	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">footsore	here	made	me	more…believable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	about	that	comment	just	made	me	angry,	like	he’d	known	I	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">fall	 for	 his	 act	 but	 decided	 to	 hedge	 his	 bets,	 just	 in	 case.	 “All	 right,	 you suckered	me.	So	why	lie	in	the	first	place?	Why	not	tell	me	the	truth?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	set	down	his	mug.	I	could	see	the	anguish	in	his	eyes,	but	all	he	did	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">ask	 quietly,	 “And	 would	 you	 have	 believed	 me?	 If	 I	 had	 to	 come	 to	 you	 as myself,	 told	 you	 that	 my	 race	 had	 destroyed	 mankind	 but	 also	 that	 you	 would live	because	I	wished	it,	what	would	you	have	done?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	 <i class="calibre3">would</i>	I	have	done?	In	that	moment,	I	honestly	couldn’t	say	for	certain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	I’d	found	this	place,	guided	here	by	the	voice,	I	was	thinking	more	or	less</p>
<p class="calibre1">five	minutes	ahead,	only	wanting	to	survive	another	night.	I	was	tired,	heartsore, drained.	Could	I	have	found	it	within	myself	to	believe	what	he	told	me?	Maybe, </p>
<p class="calibre1">if	he’d	given	me	a	little	demonstration	of	that	“floating	above	the	ground”	trick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether	I	would	have	allowed	him	into	my	heart	and	my	bed	was	an	entirely</p>
<p class="calibre1">different	matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don’t	 know!”	 I	 flung	 at	 him.	 “All	 I	 do	 know	 is	 that	 you	 came	 here,	 and you	 <i class="calibre3">lied</i>	to	me,	made	me	think	you	were	someone	else…made	me	 <i class="calibre3">love</i>	you…and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p204"></a>now	I	have	to	reconcile	that	with	the	truth,	with	the	way	you	used	me	—	” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Horrible,	choking	sobs	rose	in	my	throat	after	that,	and	I	had	to	stop,	to	drop</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	mug	on	the	counter	and	turn	away	from	him	so	I	wouldn’t	have	to	look	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	face,	the	face	that	used	to	be	Jace’s	and	wasn’t	anymore,	tears	rising	up	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">blind	me	all	over	again.	A	mercy,	because	then	I	couldn’t	see	him	clearly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 I	 could	 feel	 him,	 warm	 fingers	 lacing	 through	 mine	 and	 pulling	 me</p>
<p class="calibre1">against	him,	his	voice	rough	with	sorrow	as	he	said,	“Beloved,	it	was	never	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">intention	to	hurt	you.	I	thought	perhaps	it	might	be	easier	—	” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	 call	 me	 that!”	 I	 gasped,	 pushing	 at	 him,	 trying	 to	 free	 myself.	 He resisted	for	a	scant	second,	and	then	released	me,	backing	away	and	holding	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 hands	 as	 if	 to	 show	 he	 had	 no	 intention	 of	 attempting	 to	 touch	 me	 again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Angrily,	I	wiped	at	my	tears	with	the	back	of	one	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very	well…Jessica.”	He	pulled	in	a	breath,	and	I	noticed	how	his	chest	rose</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 fell,	 as	 if	 he	 were	 struggling	 to	 gain	 control	 of	 himself.	 Could	 djinn experience	an	accelerated	heartbeat,	or	difficulty	breathing?	One	wouldn’t	think</p>
<p class="calibre1">so,	if	they	truly	weren’t	completely	tied	to	this	plane	of	existence,	or	a	physical body.	But	Jasreel	was	giving	a	good	enough	imitation	of	it	now.	Then	again,	he’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">already	proved	that	he	was	pretty	good	at	pretending	he	was	something	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking	a	little	less	wild-eyed,	he	went	on,	“Jessica,	I	came	to	you	as	Jason</p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	 River	 because	 I	 thought	 it	 would	 be	 easier	 for	 you.	 I	 thought	 we	 could grow	to	be	comfortable	with	one	another	first,	and	then,	when	the	time	was	right, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	would	tell	you	who	I	was	really	was,	the	truth	behind	the	Dying.	It	was	never</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	intention	to	hurt	you.	How	could	it	be,	when	I	swore	an	oath	as	I	chose	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	your	life	would	be	more	precious	than	all	the	riches	in	the	world	to	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	took	a	step	in	my	direction,	and	I	retreated	several	feet	toward	the	kitchen</p>
<p class="calibre1">entrance.	That	stopped	him,	and	he	raised	his	hands	again,	almost	as	if	he	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	much	telling	himself	to	halt	as	he	was	showing	that	he	didn’t	intend	to	pursue</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	 or	 reach	 out	 for	 me.	 As	 I	 stood	 there,	 halfway	 toward	 the	 dining	 room,	 I realized	 that	 poor	 Dutchie,	 like	 most	 dogs	 who	 hate	 hearing	 their	 people	 fight, had	retreated	under	the	little	round	table	in	the	nook	and	was	staring	at	us	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">worried	mismatched	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 some	 reason,	 seeing	 her	 reaction	 to	 our	 quarrel	 made	 me	 calm	 down	 a bit.	Dutchie	loved	me,	but	I	remembered	that	she	loved	Jace	—	Jasreel	—	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	if	she	loved	Jasreel,	surely	that	meant	he	couldn’t	be	evil,	or	anything	close to	it.	I’d	seen	the	way	she’d	reacted	to	Chris	Bowman,	so	I	knew	she	wasn’t	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	those	dogs	who	indiscriminately	liked	everyone.	Whatever	lies	Jasreel	might</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 told	 me	 in	 order	 to	 ease	 his	 way	 into	 my	 life,	 I	 knew	 then	 that	 he’d	 told them	out	of	a	misguided	attempt	to	protect	me,	to	avoid	frightening	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p205"></a>I	 was	 angry	 with	 him,	 and	 I	 was	 scared,	 almost	 as	 scared	 as	 the	 night	 my father	died,	but	in	that	moment,	I	knew	I	didn’t	hate	him.	Some	part	of	my	soul</p>
<p class="calibre1">wouldn’t	allow	me	to	hate	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	 brought	 me	 a	 Christmas	 tree.	 That	 could	 have	 been	 another</p>
<p class="calibre1">manipulation,	but	I	didn’t	think	so.	He’d	done	that	because	he	knew	I	wanted	it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted	some	part	of	my	life	to	feel	normal,	even	when	hardly	anything	in	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">normal	anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	 something	 in	 my	 expression	 shifted.	 I	 couldn’t	 say	 for	 sure,	 but	 it must	have	been	enough	to	give	Jasreel	some	hope,	because	he	said,	“Do	you	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">wish	for	me	to	go?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 didn’t…but	 I	 also	 didn’t	 know	 how	 I	 could	 begin	 to	 process	 all	 this	 with him	around	all	the	time.	“I	don’t	know,”	I	replied.	“A	minute	ago,	I	would	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	yes.	But	—	” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	time	to	take	a	deep	breath	of	my	own.	“I	suppose	I	want	some	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">answers.	What	was	that	—	the	other	djinn	saying	about	the	Immune?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 he	 was	 disconcerted	 by	 my	 change	 of	 subject,	 Jasreel	 didn’t	 show	 it.	 He could	have	simply	been	relieved	that	I	was	willing	to	go	on	talking,	even	if	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">topic	 of	 conversation	 had	 moved	 away	 from	 the	 two	 of	 us	 and	 where	 our relationship	currently	stood,	and	on	to	something	more	neutral. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“His	 name	 is	 Zahrias.	 He	 is	 the	 leader	 of	 our	 group	 in	 this	 —	 sector,	 I suppose,	is	the	best	word	for	it.	The	region	is	not	quite	analogous	to	your	state	of New	Mexico,	but	close	enough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	this	Zahrias	came	here	to,	what,	warn	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“More	or	less.”	Jasreel	shifted,	and	I	could	tell	he’d	been	about	to	step	closer</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	me,	but	had	pulled	back	at	the	last	second.	“In	general,	we	djinn	are	able	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">look	in	on	human	affairs	with	very	little	interference.	If	we	suddenly	can’t	do	so with	the	group	at	Los	Alamos	—	” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lo,”	I	said,	and	he	stopped	and	shot	me	an	inquiring	look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	was	the	transmission,	wasn’t	it?”	Another	spark	that	could	be	fanned</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	anger.	Now	I	thought	I	understood	what	I’d	heard	so	briefly	on	the	ham	radio. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Voice	 tight,	 I	 said,	 “The	 people	 —	 the	 Immune	 —	 were	 transmitting	 from	 Los Alamos.	And	you…cut	it	off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	 Jasreel	 replied,	 sounding	 resigned.	 “And	 yes,	 I	 disrupted	 the	 signal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only	because	I	wanted	more	time	alone	with	you.	Until	Zahrias	came	to	see	me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	know	the	group	there	was	any	kind	of	a	threat.	I	only	knew	they	must	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">Immune,	and	so	their	time	on	this	earth	was	limited.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 decided	 to	 put	 that	 anger	 aside	 to	 be	 dealt	 with	 later.	 “So	 they’re	 a	 threat</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p206"></a>just	because	you	can’t	spy	on	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 more	 than	 that,	 Jessica.	 The	 Immune	 simply	 should	 not	 have	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">capability	to	keep	us	from	looking	in	on	their	doings.	And	now	that	some	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chosen	 have	 disappeared,	 the	 ones	 who	 volunteered	 to	 go	 where	 we	 could	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1">—	well,	you	can	see	how	that	would	be	very	troubling.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	 his	 perspective,	 I	 supposed	 it	 was.	 For	 myself,	 I	 was	 more	 intrigued than	anything	else.	What	were	they	doing	at	Los	Alamos	that	would	allow	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 evade	 djinn	 surveillance?	 I	 didn’t	 know	 much	 about	 the	 town,	 except	 that	 it was	 still	 a	 place	 for	 research	 and	 had	 quite	 a	 few	 government	 contractor–type businesses.	 We	 drove	 up	 there	 once	 when	 I	 was	 in	 high	 school,	 more	 to	 go someplace	off	the	beaten	path	than	for	any	other	reason,	and	it	really	did	feel	like I’d	 just	 walked	 onto	 the	 set	 of	 that	 TV	 show	  <i class="calibre3">Eureka</i>,	 the	 one	 about	 a	 town populated	by	mad	scientists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	I	figured	the	probability	of	discovering	the	truth	about	what	the	Immune</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	Los	Alamos	were	doing	was	roughly	the	same	as	waking	up	to	discover	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 all	 been	 a	 terrible	 dream,	 so	 I	 moved	 on	 to	 my	 next	 question.	 “And	 the djinn?	The	ones	from	this	sector,	I	mean.	Zahrias	made	it	sound	as	if	they	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	holed	up	somewhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jasreel	 gave	 me	 an	 incongruous	 grin,	 as	 if	 that	 mental	 image	 amused	 him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Djinn	 do	 not	 precisely	 ‘hole	 up,’	 but	 they	 are	 using	 Taos	 as	 their	 base	 of operations.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?”	I	asked,	surprised.	A	touristy	little	town	didn’t	seem	like	quite	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">right	spot	for	a	bunch	of	supernatural	villains	to	be	hanging	out.	“Why	Taos?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Since	 its	 population	 was	 small	 to	 begin	 with,	 it	 did	 not	 have	 many</p>
<p class="calibre1">survivors,	 and	 the	 one	 or	 two	 who	 were	 left	 were….”	 He	 let	 the	 sentence	 trail off,	but	I	got	the	gist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Disposed	of?”	I	volunteered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 grim	 nod.	 “Yes.	 Also,	 because	 it	 was	 a	 travel	 destination,	 it	 has</p>
<p class="calibre1">accommodations	 for	 a	 number	 of	 people,	 restaurants	 with	 good	 stores	 of	 food, and	so	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	have	power	in	Taos?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	a	manner	of	speaking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 wondered	 exactly	 what	 he	 meant	 by	 that,	 but	 I	 decided	 the	 day-to-day logistics	of	keeping	Taos	going	under	djinn	occupation	weren’t	my	top	concern</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 the	 moment.	 “And	 because	 the	 Immune	 in	 Los	 Alamos	 are	 up	 to	 something you	can’t	figure	out,	Zahrias	wanted	you	to	leave	here	and	go	to	Taos.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly.	You	and	I	have	been	safe	on	this	property,	hidden	from	the	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	 exactly	 why	 I	 chose	 this	 place	 as	 our	 sanctuary,	 our	 haven.	 But	 if	 what Zahrias	 says	 is	 true,	 then	 it	 might	 be	 best	 if	 we	 left	 and	 took	 refuge	 with	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p207"></a>other	djinn	and	the	Chosen	in	Taos.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crossing	my	arms,	I	said,	“That’s	assuming	I	would	go	with	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	the	expression	he	wore	was	one	of	resignation.	“I	will	not	force	you.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	say	that	it	would	be	safer.	But	that	is	your	decision	to	make.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Oh,	thanks	for	putting	it	back	on	me, </i>	I	thought.	But	hauling	me	off	to	Taos without	so	much	as	a	by-your-leave	would	have	made	me	far,	far	angrier.	Jasreel</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	treating	me	as	a	peer	now,	giving	me	equal	say	in	what	we	should	do	next.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 tell	 that	 Zahrias’	 news	 about	 the	 Immune	 in	 Los	 Alamos	 had	 Jasreel worried.	For	myself,	I	didn’t	think	I	had	that	much	to	worry	about.	After	all,	they were	human	beings.	I	was	one	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or…was	I?	Maybe	they	would	look	on	me	as	some	kind	of	co-conspirator,	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">betrayer	of	my	kind.	Of	course,	I	hadn’t	known	Jasreel	was	djinn,	but	I	had	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">idea	whether	that	kind	of	excuse	would	wash	with	them	or	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	 me	 think	 about	 it,”	 I	 said.	 “I	 have	 to	 go	 gather	 the	 eggs.”	 That	 had always	been	my	chore,	just	as	watering	the	goats	and	lugging	their	pellets	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 garage	 to	 the	 feeding	 trough	 he’d	 built	 next	 to	 their	 lean-to	 was	 Jace’s	 —</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jasreel’s	—	job. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 seemed	 to	 recognize	 that	 I	 needed	 some	 time	 alone,	 because	 he	 didn’t protest,	 only	 said,	 “Of	 course,”	 and	 went	 to	 get	 his	 neglected	 cup	 of	 coffee.	 I realized	then	that	I’d	only	had	a	few	sips	out	of	mine.	Oh,	well.	I	didn’t	want	to have	to	go	past	him	to	retrieve	my	mug,	so	I	wrote	it	off	as	a	loss	and	went	to	put on	my	coat	and	gloves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	djinn	didn’t	try	to	follow	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 cold	 air	 was	 bracing,	 but	 it	 didn’t	 do	 a	 lot	 to	 clear	 my	 mind	 or	 settle	 the thoughts	that	kept	racing	through	it.	I	gathered	eggs	mechanically,	placing	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	basket	with	practiced	care,	the	familiar	stink	of	the	henhouse	around	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Glancing	 down,	 I	 realized	 it	 would	 need	 to	 be	 shoveled	 again	 soon.	 If	 I	 asked Jasreel	to	do	it,	would	he?	He’d	handled	the	distasteful	chore	ever	since	my	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">disastrous	 attempt	 to	 handle	 it,	 but	 that	 was	 back	 when	 he	 was	 still	 trying	 to convince	me	he	wasn’t	anyone	except	a	guy	from	the	pueblo,	someone	who	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">used	to	taking	on	a	good	deal	of	manual	labor. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Maybe	 he	 can	 just	 wave	 his	 hands	 and	 have	 all	 this	 bird	 poop	 and	 dirty</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p208"></a> <i class="calibre3">straw	magically	disappear</i>,	I	thought.  <i class="calibre3">That	would	be	convenient. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Problem	was,	I	didn’t	know	if	his	powers	—	whatever	they	were,	exactly	—</p>
<p class="calibre1">worked	that	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	even	as	I	pondered	such	trivialities,	my	thoughts	kept	dancing	around	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">real	question,	the	one	I	didn’t	know	if	I	could	ever	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Can	I	forgive	him? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Because	 it	 wouldn’t	 be	 simply	 forgiving	 the	 lies	 he’d	 told	 me.	 To	 a	 certain extent,	 I	 could	 understand	 why	 he’d	 done	 that.	 If	 he’d	 been	 watching	 me	 for some	 time,	 studying	 me	 before	 he	 made	 me	 his	 Chosen,	 then	 he	 would	 have known	I	wasn’t	the	type	of	person	who	watched	the	skies	for	UFOs	or	believed</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	ghosts	or	any	of	that	other	“woo-woo	stuff,”	as	my	friend	Tori	used	to	put	it.	A djinn?	 I	 probably	 would	 have	 burst	 out	 laughing	 —	 if	 I	 hadn’t	 unloaded	 my shotgun	 into	 him	 first,	 just	 to	 be	 safe.	 True,	 if	 I’d	 done	 that	 and	 he’d	 survived unscathed,	 then	 maybe	 I	 would	 have	 started	 to	 believe	 in	 his	 supernatural origins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No,	forgiveness	would	have	to	go	far,	far	beyond	that.	He’d	protested	that	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t	 stop	 the	 Dying,	 couldn’t	 have	 kept	 his	 people	 from	 unleashing	 their terrible	virus	on	the	world.	Maybe	not;	I’d	seen	this	Zahrias,	the	de	facto	leader of	my	little	part	of	the	world,	and	if	he	was	any	indicator	of	the	type	of	people</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	djinn	had	running	things,	then	I	could	understand	how	pleas	for	mercy	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 fallen	 on	 extremely	 deaf	 ears.	 Even	 so,	 many	 would	 say	 Jasreel	 still	 was guilty	 by	 association.	 It	 was	 the	 djinn	 who	 had	 done	 this	 terrible	 thing,	 and	 he was	a	djinn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	right,	most	people	would	probably	think	that	way.	But	I	wasn’t	a	lot	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">people.	I	was	me.	I	had	to	make	this	decision	for	myself,	based	on	what	my	heart</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	my	gut	and	my	mind	told	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	what	they	were	telling	me	was	that	Jasreel	loved	me.	He	couldn’t	save</p>
<p class="calibre1">everyone,	but	he	could	save	me.	And	he	had.	He’d	saved	me,	and	he’d	shown, </p>
<p class="calibre1">day	in	and	day	out,	that	he	cared	for	me.	In	little	things,	like	always	making	sure he	 helped	 clear	 the	 table,	 even	 though	 the	 dishes	 were	 my	 bailiwick,	 and properly	 sorting	 his	 dirty	 clothes	 into	 the	 correct	 bins	 in	 the	 laundry	 room	 so	 I wouldn’t	 have	 to	 do	 it.	 Bigger	 things,	 like	 that	 Christmas	 tree	 and	 the aforementioned	mucking-out	of	the	henhouse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 biggest	 of	 all…watching	 over	 me,	 keeping	 me	 safe,	 all	 along	 knowing that	we	weren’t	precisely	equals,	that	he	was	a	being	of	vastly	more	power	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">experience.	 And	 yet	 he	 had	 never	 talked	 down	 to	 me,	 never	 discounted	 my suggestions,	always	took	me	seriously.	If	that	wasn’t	love	and	respect,	what	was? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	it	sounded	as	if	I’d	answered	my	own	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feeling	lighter	by	roughly	a	hundred	pounds,	I	headed	back	to	the	house	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p209"></a>let	 myself	 in	 the	 back	 door,	 through	 the	 mudroom.	 I	 scraped	 off	 my	 boots,	 set down	 the	 basket	 of	 eggs	 before	 I	 took	 off	 my	 jacket,	 and	 then	 went	 into	 the kitchen.	Jasreel	wasn’t	there,	but	I	noticed	that	he’d	cleaned	out	his	coffee	mug</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 put	 it	 on	 the	 dish	 drain.	 That	 wasn’t	 just	 sucking	 up,	 either;	 he	 always cleaned	up	after	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jasreel?”	I	called	out,	the	syllables	of	his	proper	name	feeling	strange	on	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">tongue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	the	living	room,”	he	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 wondered	 what	 he	 was	 doing	 there.	 Figuring	 I’d	 find	 out	 soon	 enough,	 I headed	in	that	direction.	He	was	standing	in	front	of	the	fireplace,	which	we	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	pretty	much	twenty-four/seven	these	days.	In	his	right	hand	he	held	a	log, </p>
<p class="calibre1">so	it	appeared	he’d	gone	in	to	stoke	up	the	blaze.	Dutchie	was	lying	next	to	him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">patting	 at	 his	 leg	 with	 one	 paw.	 Obviously,	 someone	 thought	 it	 was	 time	 for	 a belly	rub. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Smothering	a	smile,	I	said,	“So….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So?”	He	set	the	log	on	the	fire	and	turned	toward	me,	disrupting	the	dog’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">pant-pawing.	She	gave	me	a	disgusted	look	and	rolled	away	from	Jasreel,	toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	hearth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So…I’ll	go	to	Taos	with	you.	If	you	think	it’s	for	the	best.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	 expression	 of	 such	 joy	 spread	 over	 his	 face	 that,	 for	 an	 instant,	 all	 my doubts	and	worries	deserted	me.	Surely	no	one	who	could	look	like	that	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever	mean	me	any	kind	of	harm.	He	came	to	me	and	cupped	my	cheeks	in	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands,	turning	my	face	up	toward	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	sure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Was	I?	His	fingers	were	warm	on	my	face,	reassuring,	strong	but	gentle.	No</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	had	ever	touched	me	like	that.	No	one	except	Jace…Jasreel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	bent	and	kissed	me	then,	and	it	was	the	first	time	I	had	kissed	this	version</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	him,	the	first	time	I	had	felt	the	contours	of	this	particular	mouth,	the	taste	of this	tongue.	Not	so	very	different	from	“Jace,”	but	different	enough	that	I	had	to remind	myself	that	it	was	still	him,	still	the	man	who	had	kissed	me	before,	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	made	love	to	me	on	those	cold	winter	mornings	and	stood	laughing	in	a	field</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	a	billy	goat	knocked	me	on	my	rear	end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	then	I	felt	his	body	go	rigid,	and	he	took	a	step	away	from	me,	one	hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	to	his	throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 is	 it?”	 I	 asked,	 reaching	 out	 to	 hold	 on	 to	 his	 fingers.	 They	 felt	 like ice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 hands	 had	 always	 been	 warm.	 Always,	 no	 matter	 how	 cold	 it	 might	 be outside,	as	if	the	weather	didn’t	affect	him	the	same	way	it	affected	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p210"></a>“Can’t…breathe….” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 put	 my	 hand	 on	 his	 chest,	 felt	 his	 heart	 beating	 wildly	 within,	 felt	 him laboring	 to	 pull	 in	 a	 breath.	 Which	 he	 did,	 a	 short,	 shallow	 gasp.	 Better	 than nothing,	but	it	didn’t	explain	what	was	happening	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dutchie	got	to	her	feet,	nose	pointed	toward	the	doorway.	A	low,	penetrating</p>
<p class="calibre1">growl	emerged	from	her	throat,	and	her	ears	flattened	against	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">What	the	—</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 didn’t	 have	 time	 to	 complete	 the	 thought,	 because	 in	 the	 next	 second,	 the front	door	was	flung	open,	and	a	group	of	seven	men	wearing	parkas	and	heavy</p>
<p class="calibre1">boots	burst	into	the	living	room.	Six	of	them	carried	guns,	and	the	seventh	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">sort	 of	 strange	 device,	 no	 more	 than	 a	 little	 black	 box,	 really,	 with	 lights	 that seemed	 to	 flicker	 deep	 within	 it,	 as	 if	 buried	 under	 a	 layer	 of	 dark	 translucent plastic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 scream	 that	 had	 been	 building	 in	 my	 throat	 died	 when	 one	 of	 the	 men with	the	guns	stepped	forward	and	said,	“It’s	all	right,	Ms.	Monroe.	We’re	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">here	for	him.”	He	pointed	at	Jasreel,	who	had	taken	a	step	backward,	toward	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hearth.	Sweat	was	beginning	to	drip	down	his	temples. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	—	what	—	”	I	swallowed,	knowing	I	had	to	keep	it	together,	at	least</p>
<p class="calibre1">until	I	found	out	what	the	hell	was	going	on.	I	began	again.	“Who	are	you,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	do	you	want?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 nodded	 at	 the	 men	 who	 flanked	 him,	 most	 of	 whom	 were	 large,	 burly</p>
<p class="calibre1">types,	the	kind	of	guys	who	once	upon	a	time	probably	could	have	been	found</p>
<p class="calibre1">drinking	beer	at	some	back-road	dive	bar.	They	went	to	Jasreel	and	surrounded</p>
<p class="calibre1">him,	then	began	dragging	him	back	toward	the	man	in	charge	and	the	other	one, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 one	 holding	 that	 strange	 box.	 He,	 unlike	 his	 compatriots,	 was	 slender,	 of average	 height,	 and	 wore	 wire-rimmed	 glasses.	 Despite	 the	 commotion	 around him,	he	didn’t	look	up	from	the	box	he	held,	kept	his	fingertips	moving	over	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">surface,	as	if	controlling	it	via	touchpad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	leader,	who	held	himself	like	a	military	man	and	had	the	short-cropped</p>
<p class="calibre1">hair	 to	 match,	 said,	 “Ms.	 Monroe,	 we’re	 survivors	 from	 Los	 Alamos.	 We’re collecting	 as	 many	 of	 these	 scum	 as	 we	 can”	 —	 a	 jerk	 of	 his	 chin	 in	 Jasreel’s direction—	 “and	 are	 putting	 them	 on	 trial	 for	 crimes	 against	 humanity.	 Seems the	 least	 we	 can	 do,	 in	 the	 name	 of	 those	 who	 are	 no	 longer	 around	 to	 seek justice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	 mouth	 was	 so	 dry	 it	 physically	 hurt	 to	 swallow.	 But	 somehow	 I	 forced myself	to	do	just	that,	even	as	I	sent	an	agonized	glance	toward	Jasreel.	He	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">gone	pale	under	his	olive-toned	skin,	his	breath	coming	in	short,	labored	pants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	the	hell	were	they	doing	to	him? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	not	guilty,”	I	managed	to	get	out.	“He	hasn’t	done	anything	wrong.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p211"></a>“Beg	to	differ,	miss.”	The	leader	of	the	Los	Alamos	gang	gave	a	faint	nod, and	the	four	men	holding	him	began	to	drag	Jasreel	out	the	front	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!”	I	began	to	move	after	them,	but	another	of	the	group,	one	of	the	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">men	flanking	the	guy	with	the	black	box,	took	me	by	the	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 wouldn’t,”	 he	 said	 in	 a	 murmur.	 “Right	 now	 you	 have	 the	 benefit	 of	 the doubt,	but….”	He	let	the	words	die	away,	but	I	got	his	meaning.	It	was	Jasreel</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	 men	 were	 after,	 not	 me.	 The	 last	 thing	 I	 should	 be	 doing	 was	 provoking them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	gave	the	fair-haired	man,	who	seemed	to	be	about	my	age	or	a	little	more, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	faintest	of	nods,	then	held	my	position,	just	a	few	feet	away	from	the	guy	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">charge.	“What	proof	do	you	have	that	he’s	guilty	of	anything?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“His	nature	is	proof	enough.”	He	gave	another	of	those	chin-jerks	at	the	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	black	box	and	the	two	men	with	him.	For	the	first	time,	the	one	wearing</p>
<p class="calibre1">glasses	looked	up	from	his	device,	whatever	it	was,	then	gave	a	faint	nod,	right</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	 they	 went	 out	 the	 front	 door.	 The	 blond	 one	 gave	 me	 a	 warning	 glance before	he	turned	and	took	up	the	rear,	as	if	to	tell	me	that	I	needed	to	stay	put	and keep	my	mouth	shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fat	 chance	 of	 that.	 Instead,	 I	 followed	 them.	 As	 soon	 as	 I	 was	 outside,	 the chilly	air	seemed	to	bite	at	me,	piercing	the	thermal	shirt	I	wore,	but	I	ignored</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 momentary	 discomfort.	 Parked	 a	 little	 ways	 down	 the	 drive	 were	 two</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hummers,	 one	 bright	 yellow,	 the	 other	 red.	 Clearly,	 these	 were	 some	 of	 the vehicles	“liberated”	from	Santa	Fe	and	the	surrounding	area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 could	 see	 Jasreel	 being	 bundled	 into	 the	 yellow	 Hummer	 and	 cursed</p>
<p class="calibre1">mentally.	What	was	I	supposed	to	do?	There	were	seven	of	them	—	all	right,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">guy	 with	 the	 box	 seemed	 peculiarly	 uninterested	 in	 his	 surroundings	 and	 kept fiddling	with	the	device,	whatever	it	was,	so	maybe	he	wasn’t	much	of	a	threat</p>
<p class="calibre1">—	but	the	rest	of	them	were	all	big	enough	to	take	me	individually,	let	alone	as	a group.	And	all	my	weapons	were	currently	locked	up	in	the	gun	safe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 leader	 of	 the	 group	 paused	 and	 glanced	 down	 at	 me,	 seeming	 to	 really assess	my	appearance	for	the	first	time.	He	didn’t	leer,	but	I	could	see	the	look	in his	 eyes	 take	 on	 a	 certain	 glint.	 “You	 should	 come	 with	 us,”	 he	 said	 casually. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	trying	to	in-gather	as	many	of	the	Immune	as	we	can.	You’d	be	safe	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">us	in	Los	Alamos.	We	can	protect	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	second,	I	actually	considered	it.	Not	because	I	wanted	to	go	with	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">bastard	and	his	crew,	but	because	that	way	I’d	be	closer	to	Jasreel.	I’d	still	have to	figure	out	some	way	to	free	him,	but	I	thought	attempting	a	rescue	would	be	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lot	easier	if	I	were	nearby. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">No,	beloved. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	words	were	barely	more	than	a	gasp	in	my	mind.	I	couldn’t	speak	aloud, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p212"></a>not	 with	 the	 leader	 of	 the	 band	 of	 thugs	 standing	 close	 by,	 so	 in	 desperation	 I tried	to	respond	the	same	way.	Amazingly,	it	seemed	to	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">But	I	want	to	stay	with	you! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">You	will	be…better	able	to	help	me	if	you	stay	away	from	them,	and	free. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">How? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">You	will	need	assistance…and	you	will	not	be	able	to	get	it	if	you	come	with</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">me	to	Los	Alamos	now.	I	do	not	think	they	intend	to	kill	me	right	away. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">And	that’s	supposed	to	be	reassuring? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Yes,	beloved. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	had	to	ask.  <i class="calibre3">How	are	we	doing	this? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">The	 bond	 between	 us.	 They	 have	 trapped	 me	 here	 on	 this	 plane,	 cut	 off	 my</i> <i class="calibre3">powers,	but	I	can	still	speak	to	you	thus.	At	least	—</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 then	 the	 thought-speech	 abruptly	 broke	 off,	 and	 I	 realized	 it	 must	 have been	 because	 they’d	 finally	 hauled	 Jasreel	 into	 the	 Hummer	 and	 shut	 the	 door behind	him.	So	our	mental	connection	was	limited	—	by	space,	and	by	physical</p>
<p class="calibre1">barriers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Luckily,	the	entire	exchange	had	taken	place	in	less	time	than	the	blink	of	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks	for	the	offer,”	I	told	the	leader,	my	tone	as	casual	as	I	could	make	it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	if	I	hadn’t	just	held	a	desperate	mental	dialogue	with	their	captive.	“But	I’ve got	goats	and	chickens	to	tend.	I	think	I’ll	stay	right	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyes	narrowed.	“You	sure?	It’s	not	safe	for	a	woman	alone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">And	I’d	be	so	much	safer	in	Los	Alamos.	Right. </i>	Evenly,	I	replied,	“I’ll	take my	chances.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	long	hesitation,	and	I	worried	that	he	might	try	to	force	me	into	the	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hummer.	 But	 then	 he	 shrugged	 and	 said,	 “Door’s	 always	 open.	 Come	 find	 us there	when	you’re	ready.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	nodded,	and	he	seemed	to	take	that	as	the	conclusion	of	our	conversation, </p>
<p class="calibre1">because	he	signaled	the	three	men	still	waiting	outside	to	get	in	the	red	Hummer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately	 afterward,	 he	 crossed	 to	 the	 vehicle	 and	 climbed	 in	 the	 passenger seat.	 A	 slap	 on	 the	 door,	 and	 both	 vehicles	 moved	 off,	 heading	 down	 the	 drive and	 out	 through	 the	 gate,	 which	 I	 noticed	 was	 standing	 wide	 open.	 They	 must have	 shorted	 out	 the	 mechanism	 or	 something,	 although	 that	 should	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">triggered	 the	 alarm	 system.	 Then	 again,	 I	 didn’t	 know	 what	 the	 black	 box	 the weedy-looking	man	had	been	holding	could	do.	Maybe	it	could	simultaneously</p>
<p class="calibre1">short	out	the	alarm	and	somehow	trap	Jasreel	here	in	this	world,	with	no	hope	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">escape.	 Or	 maybe	 one	 of	 the	 men	 in	 the	 Hummers	 had	 just	 stepped	 out	 and clipped	a	couple	of	wires. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 a	 minute	 or	 two,	 I’d	 have	 to	 go	 inspect	 the	 gate	 and	 see	 if	 what	 they’d</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p213"></a>done	was	anything	I	could	fix.	In	a	minute	or	two,	I’d	have	to	take	Dutchie	back into	the	house	and	lock	up,	and	pray	that	no	unfriendly	eyes	had	seen	me	in	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">current	vulnerable	state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Right	then,	though,	I	could	only	stand	there	in	the	driveway	and	feel	the	icy</p>
<p class="calibre1">tears	 roll	 down	 my	 cheeks,	 stinging	 in	 the	 bitter	 wind	 that	 was	 blowing	 down from	the	north.	Jasreel	was	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	turned	so	I	faced	west,	in	the	direction	the	vehicles	had	disappeared.	And</p>
<p class="calibre1">although	 I	 knew	 he	 couldn’t	 hear	 me,	 I	 still	 sent	 the	 words	 out	 to	 him,	 letting them	ride	on	the	wind. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">I	will	find	you…beloved. </i></p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre4">Sneak	Peek:	Taken	-	Chapter	1</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 don’t	 know	 how	 long	 I	 stood	 out	 in	 the	 icy	 air,	 feeling	 the	 wind	 whip	 at	 my hair,	tears	seeming	to	freeze	on	my	cheeks.	Overhead,	the	sky	grew	darker	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">darker,	a	bruised-looking	mass	of	clouds	building	from	the	northeast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	Dutchie	who	brought	me	back	to	myself,	stirring	me	out	of	my	frozen</p>
<p class="calibre1">misery.	She	thrust	a	cold,	wet	nose	into	my	palm	and	whined,	her	head	cocked	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	side.	I	forced	myself	to	look	down.	The	dog	didn’t	look	particularly	troubled, although	I	could	tell	she	wanted	to	go	back	in	the	house.	Who	could	blame	her, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	temperature	barely	above	freezing?	Since	she	was	a	border	collie	mix, </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	had	a	thick	coat,	but	it	wasn’t	 <i class="calibre3">that</i>	thick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	time	would	have	to	pass	before	she	realized	that	Jace	hadn’t	gone	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	those	men	just	to	shoot	dinner,	that	he	wouldn’t	be	back	by	the	end	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">day.	After	all,	he	often	disappeared	for	hours	to	go	hunting,	and	he	didn’t	always take	Dutchie	with	him.	Most	of	the	time,	but	not	always. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	girl,”	I	told	her.	We	did	need	to	go	inside.	I	had	to	regroup,	figure	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	 to	 do	 next.	 Standing	 out	 here	 in	 the	 cold	 and	 making	 myself	 sick	 wasn’t going	to	do	either	of	us	any	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	 I	 went	 inside,	 though,	 I	 walked	 down	 to	 the	 gate	 and	 inspected	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p215"></a>electronic	mechanism	that	usually	controlled	it.	As	I’d	feared,	a	few	wires	were hanging	out	of	the	box,	which	meant	the	gate	was	now	basically	useless.	I	didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">know	the	first	thing	about	electronics,	or	soldering,	or	whatever	else	I’d	need	to do	to	fix	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	internal	voice	was	far	more	confident	than	I	felt.  <i class="calibre3">But	there	are	manuals</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">and	all	kinds	of	equipment	here	at	the	compound,	so	don’t	give	up	before	you’ve</i> <i class="calibre3">even	started. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">That	sounded	great.	Except	right	then	I	wasn’t	sure	I	could	even	summon	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">energy	 to	 feed	 myself	 later	 that	 evening,	 let	 alone	 teach	 myself	 enough	 about wiring	that	I	could	actually	repair	the	gate	and	not	blow	myself	up	in	the	process. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shivering,	I	pushed	the	gate	shut.	It	was	heavy,	and	I	had	a	feeling	the	next</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning	 my	 muscles	 would	 give	 me	 grief	 about	 the	 way	 I’d	 just	 overexerted them,	but	closing	the	gate	at	least	gave	the	compound	the	illusion	of	security,	if not	the	real	thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	 on,	 Dutchie,”	 I	 said,	 and	 began	 the	 weary	 trudge	 up	 the	 hill	 to	 go back	 inside	 the	 house.	 She	 trotted	 along	 next	 to	 me,	 looking	 a	 little	 worried, although	that	might	have	been	me	projecting	my	own	emotions	on	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	in	the	world	was	I	supposed	to	do	now? </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	step	at	a	time.	Up	the	hill.	Inside	the	house.	Close	the	door	and	lock	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	thugs	from	Los	Alamos	must	have	picked	the	lock	or	used	the	black	box	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">open	the	door	or	whatever,	because	the	front	door	lock	still	seemed	to	work.	Or</p>
<p class="calibre1">maybe	it	hadn’t	even	been	locked.	Jace	and	I	hadn’t	been	all	that	careful	about	it lately.	 What	 was	 the	 point,	 with	 the	 house	 guarded	 by	 a	 nine-foot	 wall	 and	 an electronic	gate? </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 now	 I	 was	 —	 well,	 I	 wouldn’t	 say	 I	 was	 exactly	 feeling	 better,	 but	 at least	I	wasn’t	inviting	incipient	frostbite.	Around	me,	everything	looked	familiar, unchanged.	 The	 fire	 still	 crackled	 in	 the	 hearth,	 and	 the	 air	 was	 spicy	 with	 the scent	of	the	Christmas	tree	that	stood	in	the	corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	tree.	I	went	to	it	and	inhaled	its	fragrance,	reached	out	to	touch	its	soft</p>
<p class="calibre1">needles.	Jace	had	brought	me	that	tree.	He’d	brought	it	because	he	loved	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 memory	 was	 all	 it	 took.	 The	 tears	 I’d	 pushed	 back	 returned	 with	 a vengeance,	coursing	down	my	cheeks	as	my	fingers	clenched	so	tightly	on	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	popcorn	strands	surrounding	the	Christmas	tree	that	it	broke,	sending	soft</p>
<p class="calibre1">white	kernels	falling	to	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shit.	I	dropped	to	my	knees	and	attempted	to	gather	them	all	up.	What	if	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 one	 of	 the	 strands	 Jace	 had	 made?	 I	 had	 hardly	 anything	 left	 of	 him,	 and now	 I’d	 just	 broken	 something	 that	 he’d	 touched,	 something	 he’d	 created	 with his	own	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">You	don’t	know	that, </i>	I	tried	to	scold	myself.  <i class="calibre3">You	made	twice	as	many	of	those</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p216"></a> <i class="calibre3">strands	as	he	did,	since	he	ate	almost	as	much	as	what	actually	ended	up	on	the</i> <i class="calibre3">tree. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Unbidden,	 a	 smile	 came	 to	 my	 lips,	 even	 through	 the	 tears.	 I	 remembered him	sitting	on	the	couch,	dark	eyes	guiltily	shifting	to	me	as	at	least	one	kernel went	in	his	mouth	for	every	one	he	strung	on	the	thread	I’d	given	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	could	he	be	so	human?	Were	the	djinn	really	all	that	different	from	us, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or	had	Jace	perfected	the	guise	of	humanity	better	than	most	of	them? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	didn’t	know,	and	right	then,	I	didn’t	care.	The	only	thing	I	knew	was	that	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">loved	him,	and	he’d	been	taken	from	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rage	erupted	in	me	at	that	thought,	pushing	away	the	despair.	Well,	that	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">right	 on	 schedule,	 wasn’t	 it?	 First	 denial,	 and	 then	 anger.	 But	 I	 didn’t	 want	 to come	 to	 acceptance,	 once	 the	 anger	 had	 burned	 its	 way	 through	 me.	 I’d	 never accept	the	way	the	gang	from	Los	Alamos	had	stolen	Jace	from	me.	They	had	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">right.	He’d	done	nothing	wrong,	in	fact	had	done	everything	he	could	to	prevent</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 Dying,	 from	 having	 his	 people	 continue	 plotting	 to	 destroy	 humanity.	 And when	it	was	clear	that	he’d	been	overruled	in	that	debate,	he’d	somehow	chosen</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	from	all	the	survivors,	had	made	sure	at	least	I	would	be	safe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">True,	 the	 djinn	 were	 responsible	 for	 humanity’s	 demise,	 but	 not	 all	 of	 the elementals	had	participated	in	that	genocide.	It	seemed	clear	enough	to	me	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	a	fine	point	of	distinction	the	Los	Alamos	people	didn’t	want	to	make.	Much</p>
<p class="calibre1">simpler	to	condemn	all	the	djinn	as	a	single	monolithic	group,	right? </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	an	almost	physical	effort,	I	made	myself	turn	away	from	the	tree.	Then</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	down	the	hall	to	the	guest	bathroom,	which	was	closest,	so	I	could	splash</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	water	on	my	face	and	blow	my	nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 simple	 actions	 helped	 a	 little.	 Not	 completely,	 but	 at	 least	 I	 felt	 as	 if	 I had	 a	 slightly	 stronger	 grip	 on	 my	 emotions.	 Crying	 wasn’t	 going	 to	 change anything.	I	wouldn’t	allow	myself	to	feel	bad	for	having	a	temporary	meltdown, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	on	the	other	hand,	I	knew	I	had	to	get	myself	together	and	figure	out	what	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	next. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 only	 a	 little	 before	 noon.	 Strange	 how	 my	 life	 could	 be	 changed	 so utterly	before	the	day	was	even	half	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	I	looked	down	at	her,	Dutchie	gave	me	a	half-hopeful	tail	thump. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Close	enough	to	lunch,”	I	told	her,	then	went	to	fetch	a	cupful	of	food	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	big	bag	of	dry	food	in	the	pantry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feeding	the	dog	helped	me	to	calm	down	a	little.	Jace	was	gone,	but	I	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	Dutchie	to	take	care	of,	and	I	needed	to	take	care	of	myself,	too.	I	needed	to be	 in	 the	 very	 best	 fighting	 shape	 possible	 so	 that	 when	 I	 went	 to	 rescue	 my djinn	lover,	I	wouldn’t	have	self-sabotaged	by	moping	around	and	not	eating,	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">drinking	too	much,	or	whatever	else	I	felt	like	doing	at	that	particular	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p217"></a>Although	my	appetite	had	completely	deserted	me,	I	made	myself	eat	some leftover	baked	sausage	and	macaroni.	I	remembered	sitting	down	and	having	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">meal	 only	 a	 few	 nights	 earlier,	 recalled	 the	 way	 Jace	 and	 I	 had	 laughed	 and plotted	 and	 planned	 for	 the	 coming	 spring,	 how	 we’d	 realized	 we	 should	 make another	foray	to	Home	Depot	to	scoop	up	any	seeds	and	other	useful	gardening</p>
<p class="calibre1">items	that	the	gleaners	had	left	behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	 now	 at	 least	 I	 knew	 who	 those	 gleaners	 were.	 The	 people	 from	 Los Alamos. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	many	of	them	were	there?	The	leader	of	the	group	had	said	they	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying	to	in-gather	as	many	people	as	they	could,	but	that	meant	nothing	to	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">New	Mexico	hadn’t	been	a	densely	populated	state	even	at	its	peak.	Altogether, </p>
<p class="calibre1">there	were	probably	only	a	few	thousand	survivors	of	the	Dying	here,	but	how</p>
<p class="calibre1">many	of	those	humans	had	the	vengeful	djinn	picked	off	before	those	few	souls</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	make	it	to	this	supposed	haven	in	Los	Alamos? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wasn’t	sure	I	wanted	to	guess,	but	between	that	and	the	inevitable	disease</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 accidents	 that	 occurred	 after	 any	 great	 cataclysm,	 I	 estimated	 maybe	 a thousand	were	still	alive.	Of	those,	I	doubted	all	would	have	made	their	way	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	small	hillside	town,	built	on	several	plateaus	nestled	in	the	Jemez	Mountain</p>
<p class="calibre1">range.	So	possibly…five	hundred?	Six	hundred? </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 didn’t	 sound	 like	 a	 whole	 lot,	 but	 it	 was	 still	 five	 hundred	 of	 them	 up against	just	one	of	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trying	 not	 to	 sigh,	 I	 forced	 down	 the	 leftovers,	 ignoring	 Dutchie	 as	 she settled	near	the	base	of	my	chair	and	waited	to	see	if	I’d	have	any	scraps	to	give her	 when	 I	 was	 done.	 I	 also	 tried	 to	 ignore	 the	 thoughts	 that	 swirled	 around	 in my	brain,	telling	me	that	Jace	had	been	wrong	and	that	the	Los	Alamos	crew	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	 to	 execute	 him	 just	 as	 soon	 as	 they	 cleared	 space	 on	 the	 hanging	 tree	 or whatever	they	planned	to	use	to	rid	themselves	of	their	captive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although… <i class="calibre3">could</i>	 you	 even	 execute	 a	 djinn?	 That	 is,	 Jace	 certainly	 felt	 real enough;	 I’d	 kissed	 him,	 touched	 him,	 made	 love	 to	 him.	 His	 body	 certainly seemed	human,	at	least	in	every	aspect	that	mattered	to	me.	Some	of	that	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 been	 subterfuge,	 but	 not	 all;	 when	 he’d	 given	 up	 his	 assumed	 identity	 of Jason	Little	River,	Jace	still	looked	human,	just	different	from	the	man	I’d	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	he’d	told	me	of	being	trapped	on	this	plane	by	the	device	the	man	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">glasses	 had	 been	 carrying,	 which	 meant	 Jace	 had	 the	 ability	 to	 move	 from	 this world	to	others,	planes	of	existence	I	could	barely	begin	to	imagine.	So	maybe</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	body	was	real	while	he	was	here,	but	changed	into	something	else	when	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t	on	the	corporeal	plane? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	 trying	 to	 figure	 out	 how	 that	 could	 possibly	 work	 made	 my	 head	 hurt. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p218"></a>I’d	 never	 believed	 in	 ghosts	 and	 spirits,	 psychics	 and	 channeling	 and	 all	 that stuff.	 I	 believed	 in	 what	 I	 could	 see,	 could	 touch.	 Well,	 I’d	 seen	 Jace	 floating above	 the	 living	 room	 floor,	 so	 I	 knew	 he	 wasn’t	 an	 ordinary	 man.	 And	 I’d touched	him,	so	I	also	knew	he	was	real.	Ergo,	there	were	things	in	heaven	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">earth	 that	 certainly	 had	 never	 been	 dreamt	 of	 in	 my	 philosophy…at	 least	 not until	the	Dying	changed	the	world	irrevocably. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 I	 couldn’t	 begin	 to	 guess	 where	 the	 man	 in	 the	 glasses	 might	 have gotten	 that	 device	 he	 was	 carrying.	 Was	 it	 djinn-made?	 I	 hadn’t	 gotten	 the impression	 that	 he	 was	 in	 charge,	 exactly…the	 guy	 with	 the	 military-looking haircut	 had	 definitely	 appeared	 to	 be	 the	 boss	 of	 that	 particular	 group.	 So	 how were	they	connected? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	threw	Dutchie	one	last	scrap	of	sausage	that	I’d	saved	for	her,	then	went	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">rinse	off	my	plate.	As	I	did	so,	my	brain	kept	working	away	at	the	problem.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">leader	of	the	group	from	Los	Alamos	had	said	that	Jace	would	be	put	on	trial	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	supposed	crimes.	Would	it	be	a	real	trial,	or	at	least	a	facsimile	of	one,	with	a prosecutor	and	a	defense	attorney	and	all	that?	Or	would	they	dispense	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">niceties,	declare	him	guilty	after	a	sham	trial,	and	string	him	up	anyway? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	thought	crossed	my	mind	that	I	could	go	to	Los	Alamos	and	offer	myself</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	his	defender.	Never	mind	that	everything	I	knew	about	courtroom	procedures</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	 gleaned	 from	 watching	 old	 episodes	 of	 various	 crime	 dramas.	 Then	 again, even	 my	 limited	 knowledge	 might	 be	 better	 than	 the	 so-called	 “defense”	 Jace would	 get	 from	 whoever	 in	 Los	 Alamos	 was	 assigned	 to	 his	 case.	 If	 they assigned	anyone	at	all.	Maybe	they	expected	him	to	defend	himself.	That	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">go	over	really	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	heading	back	to	the	living	room,	I	pushed	the	curtains	aside	and	peered</p>
<p class="calibre1">out.	The	sky	still	looked	lowering,	but	the	snow,	if	it	was	coming	at	all,	hadn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	 an	 appearance	 yet.	 And	 although	 I’d	 shut	 the	 gate,	 I	 hadn’t	 secured	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Until	I	could	attempt	to	make	repairs,	I	really	should	get	out	there	and	lock	it	up with	some	chain	and	a	padlock	or	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First	I	made	a	detour	to	the	office	and	woke	up	the	computer	so	I	could	take</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	look	at	the	security	feed.	As	I’d	feared,	even	though	the	cameras	on	the	rest	of the	 property	 seemed	 to	 be	 working	 normally,	 the	 one	 that	 overlooked	 the	 front gate	 was	 dark,	 so	 it	 had	 to	 have	 been	 disabled	 at	 the	 same	 time	 the	 main mechanism	was	circumvented. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	 at	 least	 I	 had	 eyes	 on	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 compound.	 That	 was	 better	 than nothing.	 Also,	 I	 was	 able	 to	 scrounge	 some	 chain	 and	 a	 padlock	 —	 still	 in	 its clamshell	packaging	—	from	the	storage	area	in	the	basement,	and	that	made	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">feel…well,	not	better,	exactly,	but	at	least	slightly	safer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	pulled	on	my	coat	and	scarf,	but	not	my	gloves,	since	I	needed	the	full	use</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p219"></a>of	my	hands.	Once	I	was	outfitted,	I	went	back	outside,	Dutchie	bounding	along at	my	heels,	and	headed	down	to	the	gate,	which	I	secured	to	the	wall	as	best	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 by	 looping	 the	 chain	 around	 the	 steel	 frame	 bolted	 to	 the	 adobe.	 When	 I pulled	 on	 it,	 there	 might	 have	 been	 the	 slightest	 amount	 of	 give,	 but	 overall,	 it seemed	sturdy	enough.	No,	it	wouldn’t	stand	up	to	someone	driving	a	Hummer</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	it,	and	if	you	were	determined	enough,	you	could	probably	still	climb	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	over	the	gate	itself,	but	I	thought	it	should	deter	anyone	who	was	only	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 some	 casual	 looting.	 If	 such	 a	 person	 even	 existed;	 for	 all	 I	 knew,	 I	 was taking	all	these	precautions	for	nothing.	The	Los	Alamos	team	had	included	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	people	I’d	seen	since	I’d	left	Albuquerque. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	having	the	gate	locked	made	me	feel	a	little	better,	if	nothing	else,	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">needed	to	feel	better.	I	needed	to	tell	myself	there	was	still	hope,	that	this	would all	 somehow	 work	 out	 in	 the	 end.	 Right	 then	 I	 couldn’t	 see	 how	 that	 was possible,	but	when	the	Heat	had	swept	through	Albuquerque,	I	was	sure	I	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">die	along	with	everyone	else,	and	yet	here	I	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Good	enough	for	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	went	back	inside,	and	I	piled	a	few	more	logs	on	the	fireplace.	A	long, </p>
<p class="calibre1">empty	afternoon	stretched	in	front	of	me.	Funny	how	I’d	never	felt	at	loose	ends</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	 Jace	 was	 around.	 We’d	 always	 had	 plenty	 to	 occupy	 us.	 Well,	 in	 a	 few hours	I’d	have	to	go	out	and	feed	the	chickens	and	the	goats,	make	sure	they	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">fresh	water,	but	what	I	was	supposed	to	do	between	now	and	then,	I	didn’t	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sit	down	with	one	of	the	new-looking	paperback	mysteries	from	the	shelves	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	office	and	pretend	my	world	hadn’t	just	ended? </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	did	go	into	the	office,	but	ignored	the	paperbacks	in	favor	of	the	manuals</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	sat	on	one	of	the	shelves.	There	actually	was	a	book	on	basic	electronics,	but when	I	picked	it	up	and	started	flipping	through	it,	my	eyes	wanted	to	cross	at	all the	diagrams	and	the	figures	and	formulas	I	found	in	it,	and	I	felt	like	crying	all over	 again.	 After	 all,	 there	 was	 a	 reason	 why	 I’d	 been	 getting	 my	 master’s	 in English,	and	not	in	electrical	engineering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 meltdown	 was	 not	 something	 I’d	 allow	 myself,	 though.	 I	 made	 a	 few</p>
<p class="calibre1">desultory	 notes	 about	 possible	 methods	 of	 fixing	 the	 gate,	 peered	 outside	 and saw	the	snow	had	finally	arrived,	then	decided	I’d	better	take	care	of	the	animals early	before	it	got	too	bad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	goats	had	already	taken	shelter	in	their	shed,	so	I	filled	their	trough	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">pellets.	Their	water	still	looked	good	—	Jace	had	handled	that	in	the	morning	—</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	I	left	it	for	now.	Same	thing	with	the	chickens,	although	there	were	a	few	new</p>
<p class="calibre1">eggs.	I	scooped	them	into	my	pockets	before	heading	back	to	the	house,	dodging</p>
<p class="calibre1">snowflakes	the	whole	way.	It	seemed	the	storm	had	decided	to	arrive	in	earnest. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p220"></a>Inside	it	was	snug	and	warm	enough,	though,	and	I	puttered	here	and	there, forcing	myself	to	focus	on	mundane	chores,	such	as	bringing	in	more	wood	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	log	room	on	the	side	of	the	house	and	stoking	up	all	the	fireplaces	to	combat</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 rapidly	 dropping	 temperatures	 outside.	 Busyness	 helped	 a	 little,	 although	 I couldn’t	 help	 feeling	 the	 gnawing,	 aching	 sensation	 somewhere	 in	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">midsection,	the	one	that	told	me	Jace	was	gone	and	I	had	absolutely	no	idea	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">how	to	get	him	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">It	 isn’t	 fair, </i>	 I	 thought	 irrationally.  <i class="calibre3">To	 survive	 the	 Dying,	 to	 lose	 everyone	 I</i> <i class="calibre3">cared	about,	and	then	to	lose	him,	too. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Well,	 as	 my	 parents	 had	 been	 all	 too	 fond	 of	 pointing	 out,	 life	 wasn’t	 fair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	right	then	I	wasn’t	about	to	dissect	the	cognitive	dissonance	that	came	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowing	Jace’s	people	were	the	ones	responsible	for	the	Dying,	and	yet	still	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">miss	 him,	 to	 want	 him,	 to	 know	 that	 I	 loved	 him	 in	 a	 way	 I	 hadn’t	 thought	 I could	 ever	 love	 anyone.	 My	 anger	 with	 him	 at	 deceiving	 me	 about	 his	 true identity	had	been	as	intense	as	a	summer	monsoon	storm,	but	just	as	short-lived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	I	only	wanted	him	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sitting	at	the	table	in	the	breakfast	nook	where	we’d	shared	too	many	meals</p>
<p class="calibre1">hurt	 far	 too	 much,	 and	 so	 did	 the	 idea	 of	 trying	 to	 eat	 at	 that	 vast	 dining	 room table.	I	took	my	dinner	of	heated-up	canned	soup	and	toasted	bread	to	the	living</p>
<p class="calibre1">room	 where	 I	 could	 eat	 in	 front	 of	 the	 fireplace,	 although	 even	 the	 warmth	 of that	fire	didn’t	seem	to	penetrate	the	core	of	cold	at	the	very	center	of	my	being. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing	could	dispel	that	inner	chill,	except	Jace’s	touch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wondered	if	I	should	leave	here	the	next	day,	head	up	to	Taos	and	see	if	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">djinn	 there	 could	 do	 anything	 to	 help	 me.	 But	 no,	 that	 wouldn’t	 work.	 Zahrias had	 said	 his	 people	 were	 unable	 to	 penetrate	 the	 veil	 that	 had	 apparently descended	on	Los	Alamos,	and	had	resorted	to	sending	some	of	their	Chosen	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 enclave	 of	 the	 Immune	 to	 see	 what	 they	 could	 discover.	 Since	 none	 of	 the Chosen	had	returned,	I	had	to	believe	that	they’d	either	been	captured	as	spies, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or	had	a	change	of	heart	once	they	were	safe	and	among	their	own	kind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No,	 that	 didn’t	 seem	 right.	 I	 knew	 that	 being	 around	 the	 other	 survivors wouldn’t	 have	 changed	 how	 I	 felt	 about	 Jace;	 if	 anything,	 it	 would	 have	 made me	 work	 harder	 to	 convince	 them	 that	 not	 all	 the	 djinn	 were	 evil.	 Those	 other Chosen	 must	 have	 been	 caught,	 found	 out.	 Would	 they	 also	 be	 put	 on	 trial	 as traitors? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 didn’t	 know	 for	 sure.	 The	 leader	 of	 the	 group	 that	 captured	 Jace	 had appeared	interested	in	convincing	me	to	join	them,	and	not	because	he	seemed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">think	I	was	guilty	of	crimes	against	humanity	or	whatever.	No,	I’d	seen	that	look</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	enough	guys’	faces	at	bars	or	clubs	to	know	what	it	meant	—	that	he	wouldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind	getting	into	my	pants	in	the	near	future. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p221"></a>There	 was	 a	 joke.	 I	 would	 rather	 have	 jumped	 into	 bed	 with	 Zahrias	 than with	that	human	bastard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	his	interest	was	still	something	I	might	be	able	to	exploit	at	a	later	date, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	it	also	told	me	that	he	was	willing	to	overlook	my	fraternizing	with	Jace,	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">long	as	there	was	no	chance	of	it	happening	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	right,	I’d	found	an	angle.	What	exactly	I	could	do	with	it,	I	didn’t	know.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">also	couldn’t	help	wondering	if	Jace	had	told	me	to	stay	away	because	he	wanted</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	 to	 be	 safe,	 and	 not	 because	 he	 thought	 I	 actually	 had	 a	 better	 chance	 of rescuing	 him	 if	 I	 was	 out	 in	 the	 world	 where	 I	 could	 find	 an	 ally,	 some assistance.	 It	 would	 be	 just	 like	 him	 to	 think	 of	 my	 safety	 and	 not	 his	 own survival. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	concern	wouldn’t	stop	me,	though.	He	could	be	as	noble	and	selfless	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	wanted,	but	in	this	matter,	I	intended	to	be	utterly	selfish.	I	wanted	him	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wanted	 <i class="calibre3">him</i>.	No	matter	what. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	right,	so	I	was	resolved	to	rescue	him.	I	still	needed	a	plan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scowling,	I	picked	up	my	plate	and	bowl	and	took	them	to	the	kitchen,	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">poured	my	half-eaten	soup	down	the	drain.	Completely	wasteful,	and	not	like	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	all,	but	in	that	moment	I	couldn’t	really	force	myself	to	care.	There	was	pallet after	 pallet	 of	 canned	 soup	 down	 in	 the	 storage	 area	 in	 the	 basement,	 far	 more than	I	could	probably	eat	before	it	went	bad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Especially	now	that	I	was	the	only	one	around	to	eat	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 thick,	 choking	 feeling,	 the	 one	 of	 despair,	 caught	 at	 my	 throat,	 and	 I grasped	the	kitchen	counter,	forcing	myself	to	breathe.	To	calm	down.	Jace	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">alive	for	now.	I	had	to	believe	that.	Otherwise,	I	might	as	well	lie	down	and	die, and	I	wouldn’t	allow	that	to	happen.	Not	after	everything	I’d	already	survived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 clock	 in	 the	 living	 room	 chimed.	 Seven	 o’clock.	 And	 in	 one	 of	 those moments	of	pure	incongruity,	I	realized	it	was	Christmas	Eve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Merry	fucking	Christmas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	went	back	out	to	the	living	room	and	stood	there	for	a	long	moment,	staring</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 the	 tree	 Jace	 had	 brought	 me.	 How	 could	 a	 djinn	 have	 known	 that	 such	 a simple	thing	would	be	so	important	to	me? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because	 he	 hadn’t	 been	 thinking	 like	 a	 djinn.	 He’d	 been	 thinking	 like	 the man	who	loved	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 doorbell	 sounded,	 and	 I	 nearly	 jumped	 out	 of	 my	 skin.	 At	 least,	 I thought	it	was	the	doorbell.	I’d	never	heard	it	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My	frazzled	brain	eventually	processed	the	meaning	of	that	doorbell	ringing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	 was	 standing	 outside	 the	 door.	 How	 had	 they	 gotten	 into	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">compound?	 Climbed	 over	 the	 gate?	 Then	 I	 decided	 that	 wasn’t	 really	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">important	consideration	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p222"></a> <i class="calibre3">Someone	was	outside. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 irritated,	 too,	 by	 the	 way	 they	 rang	 the	 doorbell	 again,	 then	 started banging	on	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	 unfamiliar	 voice	 —	 a	 woman’s	 voice	 —	 called	 out,	 “I	 know	 you’re	 in there,	Jessica!	Open	the	goddamn	door!	It’s	freezing	out	here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	someone	was	a	woman,	and	she	knew	my	name.	What	the	ever-loving</p>
<p class="calibre1">hell? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	I	could	even	stop	to	think	about	what	I	was	doing,	I	crossed	the	living</p>
<p class="calibre1">room,	 then	 hesitated	 for	 a	 few	 seconds.	 That	 could	 be	 anyone	 out	 there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	from	the	Los	Alamos	group,	come	to	finish	me	off.	That	didn’t	sound</p>
<p class="calibre1">right,	though.	I	hadn’t	seen	one	woman	in	their	group;	clearly,	they	didn’t	seem</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	think	women	made	good	enforcers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">You’re	crazy,	Jessica, </i>	I	thought,	just	before	I	turned	the	deadbolt	and	opened the	 door.	 Outside	 on	 the	 porch	 stood	 a	 young	 woman	 around	 my	 age,	 a	 pretty Hispanic	girl	wearing	a	red	and	green	Nordic-style	knitted	cap	and	a	bulky	red</p>
<p class="calibre1">parka,	both	of	which	were	dusted	with	snow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d	never	seen	her	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	stared	at	each	other	for	a	few	seconds,	and	then	she	said,	“Are	you	going</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	let	me	in?	Because	you’d	better,	if	you	ever	want	to	see	your	djinn	lover	alive again.” </p>
