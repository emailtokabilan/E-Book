<p class="calibre1">DAY	 EIGHT:	 Wednesday,	 15	 June	 2472,	 Chukotka	 Autonomous	 Okrug, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Siberia,	Russia</p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 first	 he	 spins.	 The	 sky	 and	 the	 trees	 below	 spin	 too,	 and	 his	 stomach lurches.	 Then	 he	 is	 parallel	 to	 the	 horizon,	 arms	 and	 legs	 spread-eagled	 like	 a skydiver.	The	air	pushes	at	his	limbs.	He	extends	and	flexes	his	fingers,	lifts	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">head	 and	 looks	 across	 the	 treetops	 at	 the	 breath-taking	 scale	 of	 the	 forest,	 the unbroken	 canopy	 of	 green	 stretching	 into	 the	 misty	 horizon	 and	 cloud-covered mountains	 in	 the	 distance.	 The	 assault	 on	 his	 senses	 and	 instincts	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">overwhelming.	 Beauty,	 joy,	 exhilaration,	 and	 terror	 all	 at	 once.	 The	 ground	 is pulling	him	towards	it	at	an	alarming	rate. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I’m	going	to	die, </i>	he	thinks.	Then,  <i class="calibre4">This	isn’t	real.	This	is	not	real. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	trees	rush	towards	him,	as	he	nears	the	ground,	he	passes	close	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">side	of	a	rocky	cliff	face,	pounding	white	water	throttling	down,	and	he	is	like	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">stone	 in	 the	 waterfall.	 The	 spray	 soaks	 him	 to	 the	 skin.	 Fighting	 fear,	 he	 dares glance	below.	There	is	a	lake	where	the	falling	water	gathers:	a	blue	pool,	pale	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	edges,	shading	to	sapphire	in	the	centre. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I	hope	it’s	deep</i>,	he	thinks	as	he	breaks	the	surface,	feet	first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	plunges	until	the	water	finally	catches	hold	of	him	like	firm	hands,	and	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	slowed,	for	moments	on	end,	still	and	hanging,	suspended	in	chains	of	bubbles</p>
<p class="calibre1">escaping	 to	 the	 surface.	 It	 is	 dark	 and	 cold.	 Visibility	 is	 limited	 to	 a	 few	 feet ahead.	Staring	into	the	darkness,	he	half-expects	a	monster	of	the	deep	to	snatch</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	 in	 its	 jaws	 or	 tentacles.	 Without	 even	 realising	 it,	 he	 is	 clawing	 his	 way towards	 the	 air,	 his	 arms	 reaching	 around	 and	 down,	 the	 pressure	 of	 the	 water helping	 him,	 forcing	 him	 towards	 the	 world.	 Light	 refracts	 on	 the	 surface, glistening	and	dancing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Breaking	 through	 to	 his	 own	 element,	 he	 takes	 great	 gulps	 of	 air,	 his	 chest shuddering	painfully,	his	arms	thrashing.	His	head	goes	under	and	he	swallows</p>
<p class="calibre1">water;	 he	 emerges	 coughing	 and	 choking	 and	 thrashes	 some	 more,	 plunging</p>
<p class="calibre1">under,	panicking,	until	some	strange,	calm	voice	in	his	head	tells	him	to	stop,	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	still,	to	lie	back	in	the	water,	to	trust,	to	get	control	of	his	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>Then	 he	 is	 suspended	 on	 the	 top	 of	 the	 sapphire	 pool,	 arms	 and	 legs outstretched	 like	 he	 is	 skydiving	 in	 reverse	 now,	 floating,	 waiting	 for	 his	 heart and	 the	 blood	 pulsing	 in	 his	 ears	 to	 quieten.	 The	 sky	 is	 a	 cloudless	 blue	 above him.	There	is	a	curtain	of	green	in	the	corners	of	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 sun	 is	 hot	 and	 already	 burning,	 but	 the	 water	 has	 chilled	 him,	 and	 he enjoys	the	sensation	of	his	skin	and	his	bones	thawing.	The	water	laps	his	ears</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	wet,	round,	unknowable	sounds	of	the	lake.	Bobbing	in	and	out	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sounds	of	the	forest,	there’s	a	wall	of	noise,	of	birdsong	and	the	calls	of	strange</p>
<p class="calibre1">animals,	 and	 he	 tunes	 in	 to	 the	 clamour	 and	 distinguishes	 whistles,	 clicks, buzzings,	individual	songs,	and	angry	cries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning	 his	 head,	 scanning,	 he	 spies	 a	 bank	 of	 smooth	 rock	 and	 swims</p>
<p class="calibre1">towards	it.	The	water	is	much	shallower	at	the	edges,	and	he	is	able	to	stand	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">wade	onto	dry	land.	He	sits	on	one	of	the	rocks	and	takes	off	his	boots,	drains</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	 of	 water,	 and	 sets	 them	 and	 his	 socks	 aside	 to	 dry,	 flattening	 the	 sodden wool	against	the	hot	stone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	gazes	at	the	waterfall	and	the	empty	air	above	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	is	no	door.	Nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	has	literally	fallen	to	this	place	from	the	sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	must	be	a	game,	or	a	virtual	reality	world.	Admittedly,	it	would	be	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">most	 sophisticated	 one	 ever	 invented.	 It	 is	 so	 real.	 He	 taps	 the	 rocks	 with	 his knuckles	 –	 it	 hurts.	 It	 genuinely	 hurts.	 The	 sensation	 of	 falling,	 of	 hitting	 the water,	of	swimming,	of	almost	drowning	–	well,	it	was	remarkable.	His	throat	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	sore	from	choking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still,	this	is	the	most	obvious	explanation:	He	has	logged	into	Mr	Lestrange’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">Darkroom,	which	happens	to	be	playing	the	most	remarkable	virtual	world	ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">made. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	all	he	has	to	do	is	to	find	a	way	to	leave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	is	no	possibility	of	going	back	the	way	he	has	come.		But	 there	 is	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">rush.	It	is	a	lovely	spot,	with	the	sunlight	pouring	in,	the	rocks	hot	under	his	skin, the	sound	of	the	birds,	and	the	roar	of	the	waterfall.		Lying	 back,	 he	 closes	 his eyes	and	dozes	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	wakes	with	a	start. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	 disturbing	 –	 life-threatening,	 even	 –	 has	 pulled	 him	 from	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">dreams.	 But	 when	 he	 sits	 and	 looks	 around,	 nothing	 has	 changed	 except	 the position	of	the	sun	in	the	sky,	which	is	now	much	farther	to	the	east	and	casting</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer	shadows.	It	is	still	hot,	and	the	air	still	sings	with	birds	and	insects. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>Discomfort	registers	in	his	brain.	His	arms	and	feet	are	red:	burnt.  <i class="calibre4">Stupid</i>,	he thinks.	And	he	wonders	again	at	the	advanced	nature	of	this	world,	making	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe	he	is	sunburnt.	Virtual	world	or	not,	his	skin	hurts	like	hell,	his	head	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">sore,	 and	 he	 is	 parched.	 The	 water	 in	 the	 lake,	 he	 supposes,	 is	 fresh.	 Wading	 a little	into	the	shallows,	he	bends	and	takes	a	couple	of	tentative	sips,	cupping	the water	to	his	mouth	with	his	palms.	It	tastes	good,	and	he	gulps	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 ponders	 what	 he	 should	 do	 next.	 Where	 to	 start	 to	 search	 for	 the	 door? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Remembering	 his	 view	 of	 the	 canopy	 of	 the	 forest	 –	 it	 stretches	 forever.	 The door	 might	 be	 anywhere.	 Or	 maybe	 Mr	 Lestrange	 will	 come	 home	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1">wherever	he	has	gone	to	and	pull	the	plug	on	the	game,	take	the	skullcap	off	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">head.	That’s	the	most	likely	scenario.	In	which	case,	he	should	make	the	most	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	enormous	playground. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">If	this	is	a	VR	world</i>,	he	thinks,  <i class="calibre4">then	there	should	be	a	map</i>.	He	calls	his	Lenz to	try	the	Nexus	and	sees	a	list	of	available	networks.	They	are	all	in	a	strange</p>
<p class="calibre1">alphabet.	He	tries	one	and	is	prompted	for	a	password,	and	a	warning	message</p>
<p class="calibre1">flashes.	 He	 closes	 it	 and	 tries	 the	 Blackweb.	 It	 is	 not	 there.	 He	 doesn’t understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I’m	really	on	my	own. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Wading	back	to	the	shore,	he	sits	to	pull	on	his	boots.	They	are	dry	outside</p>
<p class="calibre1">but	still	damp	on	the	inside.	There’s	no	choice	but	to	put	them	on.	His	feet	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">swollen	from	the	sunburn,	and	it	hurts	to	pull	his	socks	and	boots	onto	his	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cursing,	he	ties	his	laces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	around	the	perimeter	of	the	lake	is	an	unbroken	wall	of	creeping,	thriving</p>
<p class="calibre1">green,	 with	 no	 obvious	 way	 through	 the	 jungle.	 He	 needs	 something	 to	 beat	 a path	in	front	of	him.	He	finds	a	long	pole,	wide	enough	to	be	substantial	but	thin</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough	to	grip,	breaks	some	smaller	branches	off	and	tests	the	weight	of	it	in	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand.	It’s	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lake	empties	into	a	small	river,	which	he	decides	to	follow.	It’s	bound	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">lead	to	people,	to	the	coast	or	something	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	 easier	 going	 than	 he	 imagined,	 although	 he	 has	 to	 veer	 away	 from	 the stream	to	walk	around	trees	and	bushes.	His	feet	chafe	in	his	wet	boots.	The	pain</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	sunburn	on	his	feet	and	arms	is	persistent.	It’s	humid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 stops	 to	 drink	 again	 from	 the	 stream.	 The	 water	 pooling	 in	 his	 hand	 has bits	floating	in	it.	He	swills	his	hand	and	tries	again,	this	time	scooping	closer	to the	 top	 where	 it	 runs	 faster.	 It	 tastes	 fine.	 If	 this	 was	 real,	 if	 he	 was	 in	 Elgol, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>hiking	 into	 the	 wild	 mountains	 surrounding	 the	 community,	 he	 would	 never	 be so	bold,	but	he	needs	to	drink.	His	clothes	are	soaked	with	his	own	sweat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	ears	are	assaulted	by	the	sounds	of	life	all	around	him,	but	he	sees	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	occasional	flicker	of	movement	of	birds	in	the	trees	above.	Flies	swarm	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	face,	attracted	by	the	salt	on	his	skin,	and	beyond	the	path	he	is	beating	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself	 he	 is	 aware	 of	 small	 life,	 insects	 cutting	 leaves,	 crawling	 amongst	 the humus	of	the	forest	floor,	gathering	dying	and	decaying	things	for	their	food.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">tries	to	block	them	from	his	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	light	is	dimming,	and	he	starts	to	reflect	on	what	he	will	do	at	night	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">warmth	and	light.	Although	he	certainly	doesn’t	need	the	heat,	a	fire	would	give</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	light	and	keep	animals	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 filtered	 greenish	 sunlight	 in	 the	 forest	 suddenly	 curdles	 yellow, </p>
<p class="calibre1">electricity	 charges	 the	 air	 and	 there	 is	 a	 crack	 of	 lightning	 and	 then	 thunder, rumbling	under	the	ground	towards	him.	Another	round	of	the	same	and	a	large</p>
<p class="calibre1">raindrop	 breaks	 on	 his	 nose,	 then	 another	 on	 his	 hand,	 his	 arm,	 his	 neck,	 his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s	experienced	a	lot	of	rainstorms	in	London,	but	this	rain	comes	in	drops</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	 large	 they	 hurt.	 As	 the	 storm	 gains	 momentum,	 it	 is	 like	 whole	 buckets	 of water	are	being	thrown	over	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Water	 rolls	 off	 the	 green,	 shiny	 leaves	 all	 around	 him	 onto	 the	 ground	 in rivulets	and	streams. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drenched	anyway	by	his	own	sweat,	the	rain	cools	him	and	plasters	sodden</p>
<p class="calibre1">cotton	to	his	skin.	Carrying	on,	he	tries	to	ignore	it,	but	drops	pound	on	his	head</p>
<p class="calibre1">–	it’s	hard	on	his	scalp,	like	a	persistent	finger	prodding	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually,	 he	 stops	 and	 searches	 around	 for	 somewhere	 to	 shelter.	 He	 gets under	a	plant	with	large,	long	leaves,	but	the	rain	comes	through	as	the	branches</p>
<p class="calibre1">bow	with	the	force	of	the	water.	He	grabs	a	leaf	and	twists	and	yanks	to	snap	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	–	then	breaks	off	another	and	another	and	props	them	against	the	trunk	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">tree,	managing	to	build	a	makeshift	shelter,	like	a	half-tepee.	He	just	fits	inside	if he	crouches	into	a	ball,	his	knees	drawn	to	his	chin.	It	is	not	totally	dry,	but	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">least	 it	 keeps	 the	 pounding	 off	 his	 skull.	 Then	 he	 sits	 and	 waits,	 staring	 at	 his boots,	worrying	about	his	feet	and	grateful	for	the	opportunity	to	rest.	When	he’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">still,	they	don’t	hurt	as	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	his	peripheral	vision,	he	catches	something	moving	on	a	leaf,	near	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	 slow.	 The	 hair	 on	 the	 back	 of	 his	 neck	 stands.	 Without	 moving	 his head,	he	turns	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	is	a	spider,	the	size	of	his	hand,	walking	across	a	leaf	hanging	beside</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>him.	It	stops.	It	is	waiting,	watching,	smelling,	or	whatever	deadly	jungle	spiders do.	 He	 doesn’t	 dare	 move.	 He	 doesn’t	 dare	 breathe.	 Then,	 as	 silently	 as	 it arrived,	 it	 moves	 off	 into	 the	 undergrowth.	 He	 lets	 go	 of	 the	 breath	 he	 was holding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 rain	 eases,	 then	 stops,	 and	 he	 crawls	 from	 his	 shelter.	 It’s	 getting	 dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	forest	is	dripping. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Even	if	I	knew	how</i>,	he	thinks,  <i class="calibre4">I’ll	never	make	a	fire	in	this	dampness. </i>	</p>
<p class="calibre1">Less	 exuberantly,	 he	 starts	 to	 walk	 again,	 thinking	  <i class="calibre4">it’s	 best	 to	 keep	 moving</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	stream	becomes	a	river. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	hears	the	noise	from	his	dream.	He	remembers	it	now:	a	primal, </p>
<p class="calibre1">horrifying	sound,	a	deep,	guttural	growl.	Angry.	No	–	beyond	angry	–	amoral.	.	. </p>
<p class="calibre1">.	More	than	anything	it	sounds	hungry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stopping	dead	in	his	tracks,	he	surveys	around.	Nothing.	But	he	knows	now</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	sure,	something	in	the	forest	is	watching	him.	He	strains	to	detect	movement, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	crack	of	a	twig,	the	sound	of	branches	or	leaves	brushing	against	a	body.	His</p>
<p class="calibre1">ears	pulse	with	the	sound	of	his	treacherous	heart,	louder	than	the	birds	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">insects.	 Sweat	 drips	 off	 his	 nose	 as	 he	 stares	 into	 the	 forest.	 Leaves	 bob	 as rainwater	drips	from	higher	branches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	 getting	 dark,	 and	 he	 doesn’t	 want	 to	 be	 walking	 in	 the	 forest	 when	 this growling	creature	might	come	at	him	from	anywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 is	 standing	 beside	 a	 tall	 tree.	 Long,	 thick,	 sinuous	 vines	 hang	 from	 its branches.	 He	 grabs	 one	 and	 uses	 it	 to	 pull	 himself	 up,	 his	 feet	 walking	 up	 the side	of	the	trunk,	wincing	with	pain.	The	vine	rope	slips	in	his	hand,	the	muscles</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	his	shoulders	and	arms	burn,	his	arms	aren’t	strong	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why	didn’t	he	spend	more	time	playing	in	the	holovision	gym? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	loses	his	grip	and	falls.	Trying	again,	he	finds	footholds	between	branches</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	in	knotholes,	grits	his	teeth,	and	wraps	the	vine	partially	around	his	arm	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">gain	leverage.	After	a	few	falls,	he	climbs	the	tree,	swearing	all	the	way.	Twenty</p>
<p class="calibre1">feet	 up,	 there’s	 a	 gap	 between	 the	 branches	 big	 enough	 for	 him	 to	 fit	 in	 if	 he scrunches	into	a	ball. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s	 breathing	 heavily;	 the	 dripping	 forest	 pelts	 him	 with	 drops	 of	 rain	 still running	off	leaves	and	branches.	At	first	he	ignores	it.	He	rests	his	head	on	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands,	 his	 knees	 drawn	 up	 to	 his	 chest,	 and	 closes	 his	 eyes.	 The	 drips	 are	 less frequent	but	they	are	large	and	hard.	Every	time	he	starts	to	feel	himself	drifting</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	 to	 sleep,	 one	 breaks	 on	 his	 head	 or	 his	 face.	 After	 a	 long	 hour,	 he	 is	 wide awake	staring	at	the	sodden	wood	of	the	tree.	He	doesn’t	want	to	have	to	climb</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>down	from	the	tree	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I’ll	never	sleep	like	this.	I	have	to	find	a	way	to	cover	myself. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Grabbing	 the	 vines,	 he	 lowers	 himself	 from	 the	 tree	 and	 collects	 the	 same kind	of	leaves	he	used	earlier	to	shelter	himself	from	the	rain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	finds	some	long	strips	of	supple	bark	to	tie	the	leaves	into	a	bundle	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">climbs	again,	slightly	more	adept	this	time.	Once	he	arrives	and	secures	his	seat</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 wedging	 a	 leg	 to	 push	 his	 body	 back	 against	 the	 trunk,	 he	 hauls	 his	 parcel after	 him	 and	 unties	 it.	 He	 lays	 half	 of	 the	 long	 leaves	 in	 the	 fork	 of	 the	 trunk that	 is	 acting	 as	 his	 bed.	 The	 rest	 he	 wedges	 between	 branches	 above	 him, making	a	rough	kind	of	roof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's	 pitch	 dark	 now,	 and	 he	 tries	 to	 get	 comfortable.	 All	 around,	 plants	 and animals	slither	and	move.	He	listens	for	a	long	time,	his	eyes	open,	staring	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	creeping	blackness. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">What	is	this	place?	It	can’t	be	real,	can	it? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 same	 question	 churns	 over	 and	 over	 in	 his	 mind.	 It	 muddles	 and	 twists and	blurs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	miraculously,	he	falls	asleep. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Mathew	Erlang	is	sitting	in	his	bedroom	watching	his	two	dragons	fighting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 roll	 around	 one	 another	 in	 mid-air,	 tumbling	 over	 and	 over,	 their	 tails intertwined,	writhing	like	snakes.	The	larger	dragon	breaks	away,	flies	until	she</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	dragons	are	two	feet	long,	nose	to	tail	tip,	steel	blue	shading	to	black.	He</p>

<p class="calibre1">There's	a	knock	at	the	door.	It	opens,	and	his	mother,	Hoshi	Mori,	pokes	her</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	female	dragon	edges	towards	the	open	door,	poised	to	retreat	at	the	first</p>

<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 right,”	 Mathew	 says.	 “There	 are	 two	 of	 them.	 The	 other	 one's	 still under	the	bed.	I	gave	her	more	curiosity	and	him	greater	threat	responses.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	they	have	names?” </p>

<p class="calibre1">She	rolls	her	eyes.	“Okay,	I'm	going.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“I	won't!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 front	 door	 slams	 shut.	 He	 goes	 to	 the	 window	 and	 draws	 back	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">curtain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There's	 a	 driverless	 Aegis	 car	 parked	 at	 the	 kerb.	 It’s	 low	 and	 long,	 slightly taller	at	the	boot	than	the	pointed	bonnet,	the	wheels	jacked	at	the	back,	giving</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 impression	 of	 an	 animal	 ready	 to	 pounce.	 Its	 matte	 black	 body	 paint	 is exactly	the	same	colour	as	the	opaque	windows,	designed	to	preserve	the	privacy</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	occupants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	 all	 cars,	 it’s	 self-driving,	 controlled	 by	 an	 on-board	 computer	 and	 a remote	centralised	system	that	manages	the	flow	of	traffic	in	London.	It’s	illegal</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 drive	 unless	 on	 private	 land.	 Groups	 of	 vintage	 car	 collectors	 gather	 to manually	drive,	but	they	are	a	dwindling	breed.	The	huge	reduction	in	accidents, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	well	as	the	fact	that	cars	can	drive	faster	and	more	efficiently	and	passengers</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	 free	 to	 work	 or	 watch	 holofilms,	 means	 most	 people	 are	 happy	 to	 let	 their cars	be	driven	for	them.	Few	people	own	their	own	cars	anymore.	They	are	hired</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	a	need-to-use	basis	from	companies	like	Aegis	Shield. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew’s	 mother’s	 guard	 stands	 beside	 the	 car	 in	 a	 dark	 suit,	 his	 jacket buttoned,	a	machine	gun	in	his	hands,	passive	but	at	the	ready,	calmly	scanning</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 street.	 The	 large	 sunglasses	 are	 not	 vanity	 or	 even	 cliché.	 Mathew	 knows they	 are	 feeding	 him	 real-time	 information,	 allowing	 him	 to	 assess	 potential threats,	data	beamed	from	the	hundreds	of	cameras	and	sensors	on	the	road,	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 publicly	 broadcast	 material	 from	 residents,	 and	 the	 latest	 intelligence	 from the	local	military	police. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Visible	through	Mathew’s	Lenz,	floating	in	the	air	space	around	the	thickset</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>man,	is	his	profile,	freely	available	on	the	Nexus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	Mathew	knows	this	man	is	called	Fergus	Johnson.	He’s	thirty-eight	and	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">senior	guard	with	ten	years’	experience	in	domestic	security,	originally	trained	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 army.	 His	 unique	 security	 number	 is	 SD29106X,	 and	 he	 works	 for	 Aegis Domestic	Security	Services,	an	arm	of	Aegis	Shield,	the	largest	security	firm	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	country	and	the	one	with	the	government	contract	to	police	London. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aegis’s	 logo	 and	 its	 motto,	 “Protecting	 You,”	 are	 floating	 around	 under	 the company	name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fergus	 Johnson	 hasn’t	 published	 any	 personal	 information,	 such	 as	 whether</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	is	single	or	divorced	and	searching	for	a	new	partner,	as	people	often	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	watches	his	mother	greeting	the	guard.	As	she	gets	into	the	car,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">door	 automatically	 shuts	 behind	 her.	 The	 guard	 surveys	 the	 road	 once	 more, slides	 into	 the	 front	 passenger	 seat,	 and	 the	 car	 drives	 away	 at	 precisely	 the speed	limit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">O’Malley	 the	 cat,	 an	 expert	 at	 sliding	 in	 unnoticed,	 past	 legs,	 through	 open doors,	is	in	the	room.	Not	having	Lenzes,	he	can’t	see	the	dragons,	but	they	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	 him.	 They	 start	 to	 stalk	 him.	 Oblivious,	 O’Malley	 saunters	 across	 the floorboards	 and	 rubs	 against	 Mathew’s	 trousers.	 Mathew	 bends	 and	 picks	 him up.	 The	 cat	 immediately	 starts	 to	 purr	 loudly.	 Mathew	 pauses	 the	 Gencode</p>
<p class="calibre1">program	using	verbal	commands,	and	the	dragons	disappear.	With	O’Malley	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	arms,	he	goes	in	search	of	breakfast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leibniz,	their	HomeAngel,	is	vacuuming	the	stairs.	It	senses	him	and	stops. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	morning,	Mathew.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	morning,	Leibniz,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leibniz	is	four	feet	high,	matte	white,	with	a	HomeAngel	logo,	a	faux	virtual</p>
<p class="calibre1">badge,	on	its	chest	and	a	blue	light	where	its	heart	should	be,	indicating	it’s	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	working.	When	it	malfunctions,	the	light	goes	red.	Its	face	is	digital,	flat	and simplistic,	with	large	childlike	eyes,	eyebrows,	and	a	mouth	programmed	to	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">context-sensitive	 expressions.	 It	 does	 happy,	 laughing,	 confused,	 and	 surprised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	doesn’t	do	angry	or	sad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 are	 many	 robots	 available	 for	 consumers	 to	 buy	 with	 much	 more</p>
<p class="calibre1">sophisticated	emotional	repertoires,	but	most	people	prefer	domestic	robots	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">functional.	 Besides,	 Leibniz	 is	 a	 fairly	 basic	 model.	 Its	 legs	 bend	 slightly	 too much	 at	 the	 knees,	 making	 it	 look	 odd,	 but	 it	 climbs	 stairs	 with	 surprising agility. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 has	 four	 arms	 that	 extend	 and	 retract	 as	 needed,	 two	 of	 which	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">uncannily	human	hands	and	fingers.	It	cooks,	cleans,	tidies	things	away,	makes</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>beds,	 feeds	 the	 cat,	 disposes	 of	 rubbish,	 reminds	 people	 of	 appointments, automatically	orders	and	puts	away	groceries,	does	basic	plumbing	and	electrical</p>
<p class="calibre1">repairs,	 and	 answers	 the	 door.	 They	 got	 it	 as	 a	 perk	 from	 Mathew’s	 mother’s company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	it	stands	at	the	bottom	of	the	stairs	with	one	of	its	robot	arms	extended, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sucking	dirt	from	the	carpet.	The	house	is	always	spotless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	want	me	to	fix	you	breakfast,	Mathew?”	Leibniz	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'll	make	breakfast	myself,	thank	you,	Leibniz.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	Mathew,”	Leibniz	says	and	starts	vacuuming	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	kitchen,	Mathew	calls	up	the	news	while	he	hunts	in	the	cupboards	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	 natural	 and	 organic.	 He	 is	 trying	 to	 get	 his	 mother	 to	 buy	 in	 to	 the real-food	movement,	but	she	says	naturally	grown	food	is	a	waste	of	resources. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Abandoning	 his	 search,	 he	 pours	 himself	 a	 bowl	 of	 standard	 lab-grown</p>
<p class="calibre1">cornflakes.	They	don't	actually	taste	any	different	from	the	natural,	organic	ones</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	grandmother	eats.	Mathew	programs	the	SuperChef	food	replicator	to	make</p>
<p class="calibre1">coffee,	gets	milk	from	the	fridge	and	takes	a	seat	at	the	kitchen	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 Canvas	 is	 a	 super-thin,	 transparent,	 multimedia	 viewing	 sheet	 hanging</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	ceiling,	powered	by	wireless	electricity,	as	all	their	devices	are	now.	On</p>
<p class="calibre1">it,	he	watches	a	report	on	the	flood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looting	has	taken	place	in	the	houses	on	the	river.	The	images	on	the	screen</p>

<p class="calibre1">debris	float	by	the	lens.	One	of	the	frogmen	shines	a	light	ahead.	He	turns	slowly</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	camera	and	points.	The	camera	pans	around.	From	the	gloom	emerges	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">“The	new	Thames	Barrier	is	in	planning,”	he	says,	“and	the	government	will</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>There	 is	 an	 interview	 with	 an	 angry	 London	 resident	 whose	 face	 looms unfocused,	too	close	to	the	camera	lens.	“This	is	the	fourth	time	in	ten	years	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">Mathew	finishes	his	breakfast.	Leibniz	sweeps	in	to	the	kitchen	with	uncanny</p>

<p class="calibre1">Although	 Mathew	 has	 only	 used	 the	 kitchen	 sink	 to	 pour	 a	 glass	 of	 water, Leibniz	sets	the	miniature	cleaner	to	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 is	 relatively	 new	 technology,	 bacterial	 germ-eating	 gloop.	 The	 little</p>
<p class="calibre1">cleaning	machines	are	hidden	inside	small	bodies	mimicking	brightly	coloured, </p>

<p class="calibre1">research	 said	 people	 didn’t	 like	 the	 idea	 of	 barely	 visible,	 constantly	 morphing sludge	moving	around	their	houses.	Their	kitchen	cleaner	has	a	body	the	shape</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	colour	of	an	oversized	ladybird.	The	cleaner	in	the	bathroom	is	a	pink	and</p>

<p class="calibre1">A	 message	 flashes	 in	 floating	 white	 words,	 hovering	 above	 the	 sideboard, </p>
<p class="calibre1">projected	via	Mathew’s	Lenz	from	someone	on	his	Allowed	List.	It	says:	</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Okay	to	talk?”	his	grandmother,	Ju	Chen,	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	speaks	to	him	via	simultaneous	translation.	Her	English	is	rudimentary, </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>“Are	you	watching	the	news?”	is	the	next	thing	she	says.	Not	“hello”	or	“how are	 you?”	 like	 normal	 people.	 But,	 as	 his	 mother	 is	 always	 telling	 him,	 his grandmother	isn’t	normal. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Not	here.	But	we’re	a	mile	from	the	river.	I	haven’t	gone	out	yet	because	of</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	 She	 can’t	 work	 remotely.	 She	 needs	 her	 lab.	 Panacea	 have	 organised</p>

<p class="calibre1">“I	 bet	 they	 have.	 Big	 business	 must	 go	 on.	 But	 how	 does	 she	 get	 in	 to	 the city?	I	thought	the	tube	was	flooded.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is.	They	send	a	car	for	her	with	an	Aegis	personal	armed	guard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aegis	 must	 be	 rolling	 in	 money!	 Think	 of	 all	 the	 people	 they’re	 ferrying backwards	 and	 forwards	 to	 London,	 now	 there’s	 no	 public	 transport.	 Did	 your mum	say	what	it	was	like	by	the	river?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	leaves	early	and	gets	home	late.	We	don’t	have	much	time	to	talk.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">did	 mention	 it	 was	 bad	 and	 she	 felt	 sorry	 for	 the	 people	 living	 in	 the	 ruined houses	with	nowhere	else	to	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	saw	on	Psychopomp	there’s	a	lot	of	makeshift	camps	being	established	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">across	 the	 south	 where	 people	 were	 flooded	 from	 their	 homes.	 Conditions	 are terrible,	and	the	military	has	established	cordons	around	them.	There	is	nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	BBC,	of	course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	watch	that	channel?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	I	do.	How	else	am	I	going	to	know	what’s	going	on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	thought	you	didn’t	like	the	holovision?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	much	like	it.	I	find	the	Darkroom	claustrophobic,	but	needs	must.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Psychopomp	 is	 on	 the	 Blackweb,	 not	 the	 Nexus.	 He	 is	 careful	 not	 to	 say</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>either	of	these	words	aloud,	as	it	would	be	likely	to	trip	the	Nexus’s	automatic surveillance	 –	 though	 his	 grandmother	 saying	 the	 word	 ‘Psychopomp’	 has</p>
<p class="calibre1">probably	already	done	the	trick.	She	must	know	this.	“How	did	you	set	it	up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 I	 have	 friends	 who	 know	 these	 things.	 One	 young	 friend	 in	 particular, actually.	Name	of	.	.	.	No.	Never	mind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 closes	 his	 eyes,	 sniffs,	 and	 shakes	 his	 head.	 His	 grandmother	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 lives	 in	 Elgol,	 a	 notoriously	 kooky	 experimental	 living	 community	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scotland.	It	was	the	ancestral	estate	of	the	wife	of	the	leader	of	the	opposition, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 she	 developed	 it	 into	 a	 model	 village	 to	 prove	 the	 viability	 of	 sustainable living,	traditional	farming,	and	low-impact	technologies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	a	child	he’d	spent	a	lot	of	time	there,	staying	with	his	grandmother	alone</p>
<p class="calibre1">during	long	summer	holidays. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Time	 spent	 in	 Elgol	 always	 rolled	 along	 pleasantly	 compared	 to	 London. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People	took	their	leisure	over	things.	Minutes	and	hours	were	stretched.	And,	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">course,	 being	 so	 far	 north,	 there	 was	 the	 endless	 light,	 the	 days	 extending	 into night	 through	 the	 summer	 months.	 Even	 then,	 he	 savoured	 the	 time,	 some</p>
<p class="calibre1">uncanny	 instinct	 telling	 him	 it	 was	 precious,	 glad	 to	 eke	 out	 the	 days	 before returning	to	school,	something	he	always	dreaded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 Elgol	 community	 members	 were	 given	 chores,	 and	 as	 a	 guest	 he	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">expected	 to	 do	 his	 bit	 to	 pay	 his	 way.	 His	 grandmother	 worked	 on	 vegetable production,	and	she	got	him	weeding,	tending	plants	in	the	polytunnels,	checking</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 water	 quality	 in	 the	 hydroponics	 building	 while	 the	 fish	 swam	 around</p>
<p class="calibre1">nibbling	his	hand,	and	helping	to	build	new	no-dig	beds	with	straw	and	manure</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	barrowed	from	the	stables,	where	the	farm’s	huge	shire	horses	lived.	It	wasn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">work	to	him.	It	was	an	adventure.	London,	in	contrast,	seemed	so	cooped	up	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">claustrophobic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	rest	days,	they	would	swim	in	the	crystalline	waters	off	the	nearby	beach</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 take	 one	 of	 the	 community’s	 dinghies	 shore-hopping	 to	 remote	 coves	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">picnic.	 His	 grandmother	 let	 him	 take	 control	 of	 the	 little	 outboard	 motor, powered	with	recycled	cooking	oil	converted	into	biodiesel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vividly,	 he	 recalls	 the	 smell	 of	 the	 fuel	 and	 the	 seawater,	 the	 sand,	 which inevitably	got	into	his	sandwiches	and	coffee.	She	would	sit	in	the	front	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">boat	and	tell	him	stories	of	days	past	and	how	the	sea	used	to	be	teeming	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">fish	 you	 caught	 with	 a	 line	 and	 hook	 or	 with	 nets	 and	 took	 home	 to	 cook	 and eat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	told	him	there	were	once	seals,	whales,	and	dolphins	in	the	bay,	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>dolphins	 would	 sometimes	 escort	 the	 boats,	 skimming	 through	 the	 waves,	 so close	 you	 could	 reach	 out	 and	 touch	 them.	 It	 seemed	 strange	 and	 fantastical	 to him,	as	did	many	things	she	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 evenings	 he	 would	 sit	 with	 his	 grandmother	 in	 her	 wood-framed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">straw-baled	 house,	 and	 she	 would	 read	 snippets	 to	 him	 from	 real	 paper	 books from	her	library,	telling	him	stories	of	how	the	world	used	to	be	and	why	it	is	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	 it	 is	 now,	 showing	 him	 pictures	 of	 extinct	 animals,	 like	 rhinos,	 tigers,	 and elephants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	parents	always	came	for	the	last	two	weeks	of	his	stay.	His	father,	Soren, </p>
<p class="calibre1">loved	to	help	with	the	projects	there,	connecting	new	solar	panels	or	windmills, </p>
<p class="calibre1">drilling	wells	for	water,	advising	the	community	technicians	on	energy	storage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 all	 helped	 to	 build	 his	 grandmother’s	 house,	 the	 community	 coming</p>
<p class="calibre1">together	to	heft	the	wood	poles	of	the	A-frame	and	carry	in	the	straw	bales	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 grass	 grown	 on	 the	 estate.	 They	 limed	 the	 walls	 together,	 and	 his	 father held	the	ladder	as	Mathew	climbed	up	to	sow	seeds	on	his	grandmother’s	grass</p>
<p class="calibre1">roof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	used	to	love	going	to	Elgol,	but	now	his	memories	are	bruised	and	tinged</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	sadness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	says,	“I	guess	the	floods	mean	you’re	not	coming	to	visit?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’re	no	trains.	The	lines	are	all	flooded	and	broken	in	parts.	It	will	take</p>
<p class="calibre1">months	for	them	to	fix	it.	I	tried	to	get	a	flight,	but	there’s	nothing	affordable.	I’ll come	as	soon	as	things	are	better.	I	was	going	to	send	you	a	box	of	vegetables, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	they’d	probably	be	rotten	by	the	time	they	got	to	you,	if	they	reached	you	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mum	wouldn’t	like	it	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 know.	 But	 you	 would.	 And	 I	 like	 to	 think	 of	 you	 getting	 some	 proper nutrition	for	a	change	instead	of	the	frankenfood	she	buys.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	real	food,	Grandma.	It	doesn’t	hurt	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 problem	 is	 no	 one	 knows.	 These	 scientists	 working	 for	 corporates	 do</p>
<p class="calibre1">things	 because	 they	 can,	 but	 they	 don’t	 know	 or	 care	 what	 the	 long-term</p>
<p class="calibre1">consequences	will	be.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mum’s	a	scientist	working	for	a	corporate.	So	was	Dad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 word	 ‘Dad’	 sticks	 in	 his	 throat.	 Two	 years	 on,	 and	 it’s	 still	 painful	 to even	mention	his	father.	How	long	will	I	feel	like	this? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,	Mat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	notes	that	she	doesn’t	say,	“And	look	where	it	got	him,”	but	he	knows	it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	she’s	thinking.	It’s	what	he’s	thinking	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mum	is	doing	her	best.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>“I	know	that	too,	Mat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	to	go	and	log	on	at	school;	otherwise,	I’ll	be	registered	absent	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.	Speak	soon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 ends	 the	 call.	 Leibniz	 tidies	 the	 cupboard	 Mathew	 disordered	 when	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">searched	for	his	breakfast. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">3	The	Naming	of	Things</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 house	 is	 full	 of	 ghosts.	 Every	 corner	 of	 it	 conjures	 a	 memory	 of	 his father.	For	the	last	two	years,	Mathew	has	blocked	these	phantoms,	walked	past</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	and	refused	to	see	them.	Now	they	are	creeping	back	in	as	he’s	able	to	bear</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking	about	them	for	the	first	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	walks	into	the	Darkroom	to	meet	his	supervisor,	he	remembers	how	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">father	 persuaded	 his	 mother	 to	 relinquish	 her	 dining	 room	 so	 the	 Darkroom could	be	built.	He	can	still	clearly	hear	his	father’s	voice,	the	particular	timbre	of it.	His	father	spoke	excellent	English,	with	only	a	hint	of	a	Danish	accent.	In	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind,	Mathew	sees	him	standing	in	the	doorway	of	the	room	saying,	“This	is	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	place	we	can	put	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	are	we	going	to	eat?”	his	mother	had	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soren	 had	 gestured	 impatiently.	 Surrendering	 the	 dining	 room	 was	 a	 minor</p>
<p class="calibre1">inconvenience	to	him.	“Why	can’t	we	eat	in	the	kitchen?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	happens	when	we	have	people	over?	There’s	not	enough	room.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“People	will	come	to	use	the	holovision.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can’t	be	serious.	I’ll	never	get	any	of	my	friends	to	come	over	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	remembers	his	father	glancing	at	him,	a	raised	eyebrow	and	a	slight</p>
<p class="calibre1">smile	on	his	face.	He	remembers	his	mother	hitting	his	father	with	the	towel	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	in	her	hands.	The	sound	of	the	snap	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 they’ll	 come!	 People	 chat	 in	 interactive	 games.	 It’s	 good	 for	 Mathew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	whole	world	is	getting	them.	It	will	help	with	his	studies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	no	.	.	.	Don’t	put	this	on	Mathew.	You	want	the	holovision	for	yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 helped	 his	 father	 carry	 the	 dining	 room	 furniture	 to	 the	 driverless van	courier	that	had	come	to	collect	it	after	it	had	been	sold	via	online	auction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	spent	a	weekend	painting	the	walls	black,	listening	to	his	father’s	favourite</p>
<p class="calibre1">classical	channel	on	full	blast,	driving	his	mother	from	the	house.	There’s	still	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">stain	on	the	sanded	wood	floor	where	Mathew	knocked	a	can	of	paint	over,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	and	his	father	scrubbed	and	scrubbed,	trying	to	remove	it	from	the	woodwork, </p>
<p class="calibre1">both	dreading	what	Hoshi	would	say	when	she	got	home.	In	the	event,	she	didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">mention	it,	a	sign	of	how	angry	she	was	over	the	Darkroom	project. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	the	room	sits	in	the	house	as	a	constant	reminder	of	Soren	to	Hoshi	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew,	 one	 of	 the	 last	 things	 he	 did.	 As	 with	 all	 reminders	 of	 his	 father, Mathew	is	never	sure	if	he	wants	it	there	or	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three	years	ago,	the	darkroom	was	state-of-the-art,	but	there	are	much	better</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>setups	now.	In	fact,	it’s	just	an	ordinary	room,	painted	black	and	fitted	with	six seats,	because	in	those	days	people	still	came	around.	There’s	an	empty	space	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 front	 of	 the	 room	 for	 dynamic	 interaction.	 Hologames	 and	 holofilms	 are playable	anywhere	as	part	of	augmented	reality,	but	the	quality	of	the	images	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">often	affected	by	material	objects,	so	it’s	best	to	have	a	blank	canvas	to	project</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	onto. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Plus,	 although	 people	 are	 now	 used	 to	 others	 interacting	 with	 invisible</p>
<p class="calibre1">augmented	 reality	 objects	 in	 public,	 in	 much	 the	 same	 way	 people	 in	 the	 late twentieth	century	became	accustomed	to	people	apparently	talking	to	themselves</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	street	when	mobile	phones	were	introduced,	it	isn’t	practical	for	people	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">run	around	in	the	street	in	large	numbers	playing	war	games	and	firing	invisible</p>
<p class="calibre1">weapons.	After	several	years	of	chaos	created	by	this	kind	of	activity,	it’s	now	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">minor	criminal	offence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Mathew	enters	the	room,	the	system	is	immediately	alerted	to	his	presence</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 greets	 him.	 Finding	 his	 usual	 chair,	 he	 pulls	 on	 a	 skullcap,	 a	 plain	 plastic dome	 crammed	 with	 electrodes	 with	 replaceable	 covers.	 The	 cover	 on	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">skullcap	is	a	fake	wool	cap,	a	bit	like	a	kippah,	the	latest	fashion.	It’s	only	a	few weeks	old.	His	mother	bought	it	for	him	out	of	the	blue,	and	he	was	touched	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">surprised.	These	days	she	is	so	distracted	by	her	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 tells	 the	 Darkroom	 system	 to	 set	 his	 status	 to	 “available”	 and	 awaits	 an incoming	call.	Within	seconds	he	is	mentally	transported	onto	a	patio	and	into	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">deck	 chair.	 It	 is	 sunny,	 and	 he’s	 suddenly	 warmer,	 as	 the	 computerised	 air conditioning	in	the	Darkroom	adjusts	to	the	instructions	of	the	program.	There’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	glass	of	lemonade	in	front	of	him	on	a	table.	Reaching	for	it,	it	occurs	to	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	one	mentally	destabilising	second	that	Leibniz	must	have	been	instructed	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	system	to	provide	a	drink.	In	the	deck	chair	opposite	sits	his	personal	tutor, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Professor	 Nan	 Absolem.	 She’s	 wearing	 khaki	 linen	 trousers,	 a	 white	 shirt, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sandals,	 sunglasses,	 and	 a	 wide-brimmed	 sun	 hat,	 her	 skullcap	 hidden</p>
<p class="calibre1">underneath.	 All	 his	 other	 tutors	 run	 their	 sessions	 in	 reconstructions	 of	 their offices,	sitting	behind	a	desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	Mathew,”	she	says,	turning	to	him	and	smiling,	holding	a	glass	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	umbrella	in	it.	“Cheers!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	is	a	clink,	and	Mathew	feels	his	glass	collide	with	hers.	He	has	to	stop</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself	from	resisting	the	created	reality,	from	always	deconstructing	the	haptics</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	his	head.	He	needs	to	give	in	to	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t	this	nice?”	she	says.	“Better	than	a	stuffy	old	office?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	it	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	are	looking	at	a	view	of	fields,	a	lake,	and	trees	on	a	summer’s	day.	It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>a	 template	 in	 the	 system	 Mathew	 recognises	 but	 doesn’t	 often	 use.	 People	 his own	age	always	prefer	dystopias	and	bizarre	exoplanet	landscapes,	with	strange</p>
<p class="calibre1">rocky	 surfaces	 and	 multiple	 moons	 or	 suns.	 Mathew’s	 dragons	 fly	 into	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">landscape,	exploring.	Nan	turns	her	head,	watching	them,	smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	were	you	working	on	this	morning?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	history	of	artificial	intelligence,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Interesting?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	Very.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	distracted	or	upset	by	the	All-Day	Curfew?	Not	missing	school?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	 especially.	 It’s	 perfectly	 possible	 to	 do	 everything	 I	 do	 at	 school,	 at home.”	As	soon	as	he’s	spoken,	he	regrets	it.	He	knows	what’s	coming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	but	you	can’t	learn	how	to	work	with	others	at	home	on	your	own.	You</p>
<p class="calibre1">can’t	build	friendships.”	She	raises	an	eyebrow	and	smiles.	Her	eyes	are	shaded, </p>
<p class="calibre1">her	face	unreadable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	‘Ah’	.	.	.	On	that	note,	the	school	thinks	it’s	important	to	try	to	get	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">together	 with	 other	 students	 twice	 a	 month	 while	 the	 crisis	 continues.	 We’ve managed	to	arrange	for	transport	on	Thursday.	You’ll	use	the	day	for	work	on	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">robotics	project.	I’ll	send	details	through	to	you,	but	it	will	essentially	be	a	group challenge	to	build	a	working	robot	with	limited	resources	and	time.	You	will	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">assessed	on	your	collaboration	skills.	It	will	count	towards	credits.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	sighs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	wrong?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	honestly	want	me	to	say?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	will	score	badly	in	this	exercise,	and	it	will	bring	down	my	average.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	your	decision,	surely?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	it’s	not	up	to	me.	I	know	who	will	be	in	the	robotics	group.	They	don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	me,	and	they	won’t	allow	me	to	collaborate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 exercise	 has	 remote,	 silent	 observers.	 They’ll	 notice	 if	 the	 others	 are obstructive	and	exclude	you.	They	will	penalise	the	others	for	this,	not	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	will,	Mathew.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	rather	be	getting	on	with	other	work.	This	won’t	teach	me	anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 have	 to	 learn	 how	 to	 work	 with	 others,	 even	 if	 you	 don’t	 get	 on	 with them	personally.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	pair	of	ducks	take	off	from	the	lake,	and	they	quack	their	trajectory	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sky.	Mathew	wonders	if	Nan	has	triggered	it	as	a	distraction.	He	has	noticed	she</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>often	 does	 something	 like	 this	 when	 he	 gets	 emotional.	 The	 dragons	 take	 off after	the	ducks.	He	and	Nan	both	watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 love	 your	 dragons,	 Mathew.	 Well	 done.	 You’ve	 done	 an	 incredible	 job, </p>
<p class="calibre1">engineering	them	to	fly.	You	should	find	names	for	the	project.	My	old	professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	AI	used	to	teach	that	when	you	give	something	a	name,	you	gain	power	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">it.	He	called	it	the	Rumpelstiltskin	Principle.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	says,	“I	created	the	female	first.	She's	called	Yinglong.	I	think	I	may</p>
<p class="calibre1">call	it	Project	Yinglong.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	good	name.	Does	it	mean	anything?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yinglong	means	responsive	dragon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	appropriate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	in	a	book	my	grandmother	gave	me.	I	used	the	pictures	in	it	to	design</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	way	the	dragons	look.	Yinglong	is	a	winged	dragon	associated	with	rain	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">floods.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even	better.	So	how	is	Project	Yinglong	coming	along?” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Great.	What	happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Things	 were	 fine	 at	 first,	 but	 I	 realised	 there’s	 a	 bit	 of	 a	 flaw	 in	 the	 way	 I was	planning	the	project.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	so?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	did	a	3D	scan	of	our	house	to	create	a	virtual	world	environment	for	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	used	APIs	for	my	Lenz,	ePin,	and	skullcap,	placed	cheap	holographic	cameras</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	the	house,	and	connected	them	all	to	the	Gencode	software. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	dragons	see	virtual	versions	of	us,	scanned	in	real	time	in	their	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 are	 holographic	 versions	 of	 themselves	 walking	 around	 in	 our	 world.	 I leverage	the	virtual	reality	layer	in	the	Lenz	software	interface	for	this,	so	we’re able	to	see	them.	In	their	world	we’re	as	solid	as	everything	else.	In	our	world</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’re	 not	 material.	 They	 can’t	 interact	 with	 actual	 things.	 This	 creates	 a dissonance.	 The	 point	 of	 the	 project	 is	 they	 learn	 from	 experience.	 But	 if	 they don’t	interact	with	our	environment,	they	won’t	learn	the	physics	of	our	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today	 one	 of	 the	 dragons	 was	 clawing	 at	 some	 papers	 on	 the	 floor,	 and,	 of course,	the	papers	didn’t	move.	I	could	reprogram	their	environment,	so	things	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	world	do	move	when	they	interact	with	them	in	ours,	but	then	they	won’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	synched	with	our	world.	It’s	incredibly	obvious	that	this	would	happen,	but	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	so	absorbed	in	creating	the	dragons	as	holograms,	I	didn’t	think	of	it.	I	want</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	dragons	to	be	learning	AIs	living	in	my	world.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does	it	really	matter	if	there’s	a	bit	of	dissonance?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nan	thinks	for	a	moment,	taking	another	sip	of	her	drink.	“I	have	a	thought, </p>

<p class="calibre1">Mathew	makes	an	ambivalent	noise	in	response,	sceptical	of	her	“thoughts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	few	years	ago	I	went	to	Russia	on	a	cultural	exchange	programme,	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">met	 a	 teacher	 there	 specialising	 in	 the	 same	 field.	 We	 keep	 in	 touch	 via	 the Nexus.	We	were	talking	recently.	He	told	me	he	has	a	pupil	who’s	working	on	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">virtual	 world	 project.	 She’s	 focused	 on	 growing	 the	 world	 and	 building	 ever more	 complex	 environments	 mirroring	 our	 own,	 with	 fauna	 and	 flora, </p>
<p class="calibre1">mountains,	lakes,	and	seas.	It’s	an	environmental	project	to	test	complex	weather</p>
<p class="calibre1">systems.	It	supports	virtual	life	forms	like	yours	but	doesn’t	have	any	as	yet.	You</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 copy	 her	 code	 onto	 another	 server	 and	 run	 a	 version	 with	 the	 dragons living	 in	 one	 of	 her	 worlds.	 This	 would	 give	 them	 amazing	 scope	 to	 learn	 and adapt.	She’s	using	a	Gencode	base	that’s	compatible	with	the	one	you’re	using. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ll	investigate	whether	you	could	use	this	work	for	collaborative	credits	instead</p>

<p class="calibre1">It’s	 late	 afternoon.	 Mathew	 surfaces	 from	 a	 long	 period	 of	 deep</p>

<p class="calibre1">A	sleek	black	autonomous	car	is	slowly	driving	along	the	street.	It	comes	to	a</p>

<p class="calibre1">He’s	 an	 Aegis	 man	 much	 like	 Mathew’s	 mother’s	 thick-necked	 guard.	 Mathew</p>
<p class="calibre1">ponders	whether	their	corporate	masters	have	started	cloning	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	girl	gets	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	name	is	Clara	Barculo.	She’s	fifteen	years	old,	and	it’s	four	months	until</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 next	 birthday.	 She	 is	 single,	 not	 dating;	 a	 pupil	 at	 the	 Royal	 College	 of Music,	her	favourite	thing	in	the	world	is	her	dog	Cassie,	a	smooth-coated	collie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 knows	 all	 this	 from	 the	 information	 hanging	 above	 her.	 In	 person,	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">observes	 that	 she’s	 tall	 and	 thin,	 with	 gangly	 long	 limbs	 and	 strikingly	 large hands,	making	her	seem	strangely	vulnerable,	like	a	baby	animal	not	yet	grown</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	 its	 body.	 She	 has	 long	 brown	 hair	 tied	 back	 tightly,	 a	 long	 face	 and	 nose, striking	thick	black	eyebrows,	and	blue	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	 neighbour	 Gen	 Lacey	 is	 a	 piano	 teacher,	 and	 Mathew	 has	 seen	 many</p>
<p class="calibre1">pupils	 come	 and	 go	 to	 her	 house	 over	 the	 years,	 never	 paying	 much	 attention until	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	moment	Clara	appears	to	look	up	at	his	window.	She	sees	his	broadcast</p>
<p class="calibre1">data,	 floating	 in	 the	 cloud	 of	 information	 coming	 from	 all	 the	 other	 residents confined	 to	 their	 houses	 in	 Pickervance	 Road,	 but	 she	 doesn’t	 read	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Automatically,	via	his	skullcap,	Mathew’s	Lenz	recognises	his	desire	to	focus	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 her	 further.	 Incomprehensibly,	 he	 finds	 himself	 smiling	 at	 her,	 but	 he’s standing	 in	 the	 shadows,	 and	 she	 turns	 away	 from	 his	 window	 and	 disappears from	view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Down	 below,	 a	 doorbell	 rings;	 there’s	 the	 sound	 of	 the	 latch,	 some	 muffled voices,	and	then	a	door	banging	shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s	stepping	from	the	window	when	something	makes	him	turn	and	glance</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	other	way,	into	the	bay	window	of	the	house	next	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through	the	darkened	glass	he	discerns	a	face,	pale	and	disembodied,	staring</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 intensity	 in	 the	 direction	 of	 Clara	 as	 she	 enters	 Gen’s	 house.	 The	 face belongs	to	a	tall,	thin	man.	Mathew’s	Lenzes	adjust	to	the	poor	lighting,	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">man’s	form	slowly	emerges	from	the	shadows.	Sensing	Mathew	there,	the	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">snaps	his	gaze	away	from	the	road	and	directly	across	at	him.	Dark	eyes	in	deep</p>
<p class="calibre1">eye	 sockets	 drill	 into	 him	 analytically,	 machine-like.	 Mathew	 feels	 a	 chill	 run</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>along	his	spine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	second	more,	and	the	man	is	gone,	leaving	him	wondering	if	he	was	ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">there,	or	if	it	was	a	trick	of	the	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five	minutes	later,	Mathew	is	downstairs	making	a	snack	in	the	kitchen	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	music	reaches	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	just	a	snatch	at	first	–	there	are	bricks	and	mortar	in	between	–	but	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">few	notes	hit	him	like	a	physical	punch.	They	are	so	familiar	to	him,	yet	it	seems</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	a	lifetime	since	he	last	heard	them.	In	the	living	room,	he	puts	his	ear	to	the wall.	 The	 sound	 is	 indistinct.	 He	 gets	 a	 glass	 from	 the	 kitchen,	 and	 Leibniz follows	 him	 all	 the	 way,	 asking	 him	 if	 he	 wants	 a	 drink.	 He	 shoos	 the	 robot away,	 crouches	 next	 to	 the	 wall,	 and	 holds	 the	 glass	 against	 it	 to	 collect	 the precious	morsels	of	sound.	A	matrix	of	notes,	a	musical	puzzle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	you	feel	the	synapses	firing	in	your	brain?”	asks	his	father’s	voice,	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">Mental	lights	are	going	on,	memories	are	stirred;	half	of	him	does	not	want	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">listen.  <i class="calibre4">What	 is	 this	 music? </i>	 He	 can’t	 remember	 the	 name	 of	 the	 piece	 or	 the composer.	 His	 father	 would	 have	 told	 him,	 would	 have	 had	 him	 repeat	 it	 and tested	him	on	it.	It’s	shut	away	in	tender	parts	of	his	mind.	He	sets	his	e-Pin	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">record.	When	the	music	stops,	he	plays	it	back	to	the	Nexus,	asks	the	question, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	gets	the	response.	It’s	Bach.	The	girl	with	the	large	hands	and	the	eyebrows</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	playing	Bach,	his	father’s	favourite	composer,	music	he	hasn’t	dared	listen	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	more	than	two	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	the	girl	has	gone,	he	spends	his	evening	listening	to	Bach	on	the	Nexus, </p>
<p class="calibre1">researching	 his	 life	 and	 times	 and	 the	 highlights	 of	 his	 work.	 Using	 the	 few hours	before	his	mother	comes	home,	he	decides	to	build	a	contraption	to	help</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	listen	better,	so	when	the	girl	comes	back	for	her	next	lesson,	he	won’t	need</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	sit	with	a	glass	to	his	ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s	finishing	when	his	mother	comes	through	the	door.	It’s	late.	Leibniz	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">prepared	a	meal	according	to	her	remote	instruction.	The	robot	is	serving	when</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	darling.	Thank	you,	Leibniz,”	his	mother	says	as	a	plate	is	put	in	front</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	her.	She	sounds	tired.	“How	was	your	day?”	she	asks	Mathew.	“What	did	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	up	to?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 did	 an	 AI	 history	 module	 and	 spoke	 to	 my	 supervisor.	 Oh,	 and	 Grandma rang.	She’s	not	coming.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	assumed	as	much.	There’s	no	way	of	getting	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	what	she	said.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>She	nods,	staring	at	her	plate	as	she	slices	her	food. </p>
<p class="calibre1">O’Malley	is	under	the	table	mewing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	feed	him,	Leibniz?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 Hoshi,	 I	 fed	 him	 at	 seventeen	 hundred	 hours	 exactly.	 Rabbit	 flavour Katkins.	 It’s	 the	 new	 formula,	 as	 you	 instructed,	 with	 concentrated	 amounts	 of synthetic	taurine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.	Thank	you,	Leibniz.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	welcome,	Hoshi.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	didn’t	eat	much	of	it.	O’Malley	prefers	human	food,”	Mathew	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	why.	There’s	not	much	difference,”	his	mother	says,	poking	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	cultured	chicken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	good?”	Mathew	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	fine,”	she	says	with	a	sigh.	“I	hope	my	mother	wasn’t	filling	your	head</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	her	enviro-political	nonsense.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	 has	 nothing	 better	 to	 do	 there	 in	 that	 commune-thing	 she	 lives	 in.	 It’s dangerous.	But	it’s	her	life.	You,	on	the	other	hand,	have	a	lot	to	lose.	You	need</p>

<p class="calibre1">He	nods.	“How	did	your	day	go?”	he	asks	to	distract	her.	“Busy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nonstop.	It’s	going	to	be	this	way	for	a	while,	I’m	afraid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	eats	in	silence	for	a	few	minutes,	and	then	he	asks,	“Mum,	do	you	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	neighbours?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 she	 lifts	 her	 fork,	 she	 studies	 him	 curiously.	 “A	 few	 of	 them,	 yes.	 You know	 Gen.	 Don’t	 you	 remember?	 She	 was	 often	 round	 here	 when	 your	 father</p>

<p class="calibre1">.	She’s	a	nice	person.	I	never	have	time	to	see	my	friends	anymore.”	She	sighs</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	sinks	further	into	her	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	that	house.	The	other	side.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	mean	August	Lestrange?	Do	you	know,	you’ve	lived	in	this	house	your</p>

<p class="calibre1">“I	saw	him	today,	staring	out	of	his	front	bedroom	window.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	a	crime,	is	it?	You’re	always	doing	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	he	looks	odd.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Again,	pot	and	kettle.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	grimaces.	“Thanks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hoshi	smiles,	leans	across	and	touches	his	face,	“You	know	I’m	just	kidding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	be	honest,	I	haven’t	laid	eyes	on	him	for	ages,	although	he’s	lived	there	since</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>before	 you	 were	 born.	 In	 all	 those	 years,	 I	 think	 we	 must	 have	 spoken	 to	 him once.

<p class="calibre1">“What	does	he	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I	don’t	know,	some	kind	of	historian,	I	think.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	historian?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	quote	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hoshi	has	finished	her	dinner.	Leibniz	comes	to	take	her	plate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 nearly	 midnight,”	 Hoshi	 says,	 checking	 the	 Nexus	 clock	 in	 her	 Lenz. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Mathew	watches	his	mother’s	car	drive	to	the	end	of	the	road	and	disappear</p>

<p class="calibre1">and	O’Malley	purrs	loudly,	oblivious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 Darkroom,	 Mathew	 searches	 the	 Nexus	 for	 Clara	 Barculo,	 pianist, </p>

<p class="calibre1">Gen	 Lacey	 is	 Genevieve	 Lacey	 of	 the	 Royal	 Academy	 of	 Music.	 Clara</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>individuals	to	fill	the	room,	mostly	wearing	evening	dress.	They	cough,	shift	in their	seats,	and	fiddle	with	their	programmes.	Someone	comes	in	late	and	makes</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	people	behind	Mathew	stand.	In	front	of	Mathew’s	seat	a	stage	appears,	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">waist-high	 dark	 wood	 panelling	 on	 the	 back	 wall	 and	 two	 doors.	 He	 raises	 his eyes	and	sees	the	distinctive	mural	of	the	Soul	of	Music	in	the	cupola. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	grand	piano	materialises. </p>

She	doesn’t	even	seem	to	notice.	Her	face	wears</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	 extraordinary	 expression	 of	 peaceful	 concentration.	 She	 is	 somewhere	 else, lost	in	her	head,	and	the	concert	hall	and	the	audience	have	disappeared	for	her. </p>

<p class="calibre1">going	 to	 be	 changed	 forever.	 They	 are	 in	 his	 grandmother’s	 garden,	 making	 a trellis.	 The	 frame	 is	 flat	 on	 the	 floor,	 half	 constructed.	 He’s	 holding	 the	 wood while	his	grandmother	hammers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	father	asks	from	behind	the	camera	in	his	Lenz,	“What	are	you	doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ju	 Chen	 says,	 “What	 does	 it	 look	 like?	 Switch	 that	 off	 and	 come	 and	 do something	useful.	You’re	letting	your	son	do	all	the	work!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	camera	in	his	father’s	eye	pans	around.	Hoshi	is	sitting	on	a	bench	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 kitchen	 window	 reading	 in	 the	 shade	 of	 the	 flowering	 honeysuckle,	 which casts	shadows	across	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	hears	his	own	idiotic	laughter	off-screen.	His	father	is	pulling	faces</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	his	mother.	She	grabs	her	Paper	and	walks	away.	She	doesn’t	smile.	Before	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">video	 ends,	 his	 father’s	 pleading	 voice	 says,	 “Hoshi.	 Hoshi,	 come	 on	 .	 .	 .”	 and the	video	terminates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	last	summer	before	his	father	died,	his	parents	did	nothing	but	row. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	four	o’clock.	Back	in	his	bedroom,	Mathew	goes	to	his	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	car	comes	smoothly	to	a	stop	outside	Gen	Lacey’s	house.	The	girl,	Clara,	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	pavement.	She	wears	a	calm,	impassive	expression,	but	her	eyes	scan	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">road.	Like	most	people	these	days,	she’s	on	her	guard.	Mathew	knows	she	can’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	 his	 face,	 but	 she	 glances	 in	 his	 direction,	 perhaps	 scanning	 his	 broadcast data.	Her	hair	is	around	her	shoulders.	She	brushes	a	strand	of	it	from	her	eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	one	large,	long-fingered	hand,	tucking	it	behind	an	ear.	She	pauses	only	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment.	It’s	too	hot	to	linger.	Then	she	disappears	from	sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew’s	 looks	 across	 to	 the	 bay	 window	 of	 the	 house	 next	 door	 and	 for	 a second	 time	 sees	 the	 man	 with	 the	 deep-set	 eyes,	 staring	 at	 the	 space	 Clara Barculo	 occupied	 a	 moment	 before.	 Again	 Lestrange’s	 head	 snaps	 to	 the	 side, and	those	dark,	dead	eyes	bore	into	Mathew	like	they	are	drilling	for	oil.	In	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">next	heartbeat,	he	steps	back	into	the	shadows	of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr	 Lestrange	 is	 watching	 the	 pianist,	 Mathew	 is	 sure	 of	 it	 now.	 But	 why? </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	should	he	tell	her?	What	would	he	say? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	goes	downstairs,	realising	with	surprise	that	he’s	shaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	O’Malley	butting	against	him	and	the	dragons	dive-bombing	him	as	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">kneels	 on	 the	 floor,	 he	 installs	 his	 tiny	 amplifier	 in	 the	 front	 room,	 in	 a	 gap behind	 the	 skirting	 boards,	 under	 a	 loose	 flap	 of	 wallpaper.	 It’s	 a	 place	 his mother	is	unlikely	to	discover	and	Leibniz	is	unlikely	to	disturb	while	cleaning. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>It’s	rigged	so	the	audio	stream	comes	through	to	his	e-Pin.	He	switches	on	the feed	 now,	 setting	 it	 to	 record,	 so	 he’ll	 be	 able	 to	 listen	 to	 the	 music	 again afterwards.	The	amplifier	is	so	sensitive	it	detects	footsteps	in	Gen’s	house.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">hinge	 of	 an	 inner	 door	 squeaks,	 and	 he	 imagines	 Gen	 Lacey	 and	 her	 student entering	the	front	room,	where	he	knows	she	keeps	her	grand	piano. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was	your	journey	okay?”	Gen	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	fine.	The	car	cuts	across	town.	We	take	a	bit	of	a	detour,	but	there	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">fewer	cars	on	the	road	than	normal,	so	it	takes	the	same	time	as	the	direct	route</p>
<p class="calibre1">nearer	 the	 river.	 I	 didn’t	 notice	 anything	 too	 unusual,	 except	 no	 one’s	 about, there’s	no	people	walking	around.	It’s	like	Sunday	morning	all	day,	every	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	are	your	parents	coping?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 they’re	 fine.	 Since	 they’re	 teachers,	 they’re	 stuck	 at	 home,	 doing	 their supervision	 and	 lesson	 authoring	 from	 there.	 I	 think	 they’re	 enjoying	 it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">actually.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 have	 to	 say,	 it	 doesn’t	 make	 a	 huge	 amount	 of	 difference	 to	 me,	 either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	what	do	you	want	to	work	on	today?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	struggling	with	the	opening	piece.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Honestly,	Clara,	I	think	you’re	worrying	over	nothing.	You	still	have	plenty</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	time	to	prepare,	and	the	way	you’re	playing,	there’s	very	little	to	work	to	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	expression	isn’t	right,”	the	girl	says.	“Technically,	it’s	fine,	but	it’s	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	I	want	to	say.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	you	start?	I’ll	listen,	and	then	we’ll	discuss.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	sits	on	the	floor	with	his	back	to	the	wall,	the	sound	coming	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">amplifier.	 His	 head	 resting	 against	 the	 wallpaper,	 he	 closes	 his	 eyes.	 O’Malley climbs	into	his	lap	and	falls	asleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Memories	 of	 his	 father	 flood	 back,	 in	 particular	 his	 love	 of	 classical	 piano music.	For	the	past	two	years	it	has	felt	dangerous	to	listen	to	any	kind	of	music, </p>
<p class="calibre1">to	do	anything	to	rouse	emotion.	He	has	avoided	films	and	games	with	stories	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">fathers	and	tales	of	storms	and	disasters.	It	shouldn’t	surprise	him	that	he	hasn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	able	to	listen	to	music	he	closely	associates	with	his	father.	But	now,	as	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">memory	of	his	father	recedes,	he	wants	to	pull	him	back.	The	fear	of	losing	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">forever	is	greater	than	the	fear	of	feeling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 he	 was	 five	 or	 six	 years	 old,	 his	 father	 sat	 him	 down	 and	 made	 him listen	to	Chopin’s	Nocturnes	and	Beethoven’s	Moonlight	Sonata.	Afterwards	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">listened	to	these	pieces	over	and	over,	until	they	wore	into	him.	Searching	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">melodies,	 straining	 to	 find	 whatever	 meaning	 his	 father	 found	 in	 them.	 Soren loved	a	wide	range	of	composers,	but	most	of	all,	he	loved	Bach.	Bach,	he	told</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew,	is	the	mathematician’s	music.	It’s	the	music	of	logic,	of	science.	“This</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>music	feeds	your	brain,	Mathew.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	music	is	all	Mathew	lets	in	for	the	next	hour,	broken	only	by	discussions</p>
<p class="calibre1">between	 Clara	 and	 her	 teacher.	 Clara’s	 anxious	 search	 for	 her	 own	 version	 of perfection	is	at	odds	with	the	sublime	emotions	the	music	generates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Listening,	absorbed	in	her	playing,	he	is	calm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s	 so	 lost	 in	 the	 place	 in	 his	 head	 where	 the	 music	 has	 sent	 him,	 it	 takes him	 a	 moment	 to	 realise	 Clara	 has	 stopped	 playing	 and	 is	 saying	 goodbye	 to Gen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	scrambles	up	and	gets	to	the	window	in	time	to	watch	her	disappear	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	car,	the	Aegis	guard	shutting	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 guard	 scans	 around	 the	 road	 and	 then	 suddenly	 glares	 directly	 at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	receives	an	incoming	message	from	the	guard,	not	encrypted.	Open.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">equivalent	of	shouting,	it	says:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Haven’t	you	got	something	better	to	do,	weirdo? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guard	grins	or	snarls,	it’s	hard	to	tell	which,	and	then	gets	into	the	front</p>
<p class="calibre1">seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	steps	back	as	if	slapped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 autonomous	 vehicle	 does	 a	 mathematically	 precise	 three-point	 turn	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">drives	away.	Mathew	watches	Clara,	who	must	have	also	received	the	message, </p>
<p class="calibre1">craning	 her	 head	 to	 search	 for	 the	 “weirdo”	 the	 guard	 yelled	 at.	 She	 does	 not catch	sight	of	him,	but	she	will	have	seen	his	name	and	broadcast	data	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 is	 angry,	 embarrassed,	 flustered,	 and,	 because	 of	 this,	 he	 has	 forgotten about	Mr	Lestrange,	but	as	he	turns	away	from	the	window,	he	catches	a	glimpse</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	a	shadowy	figure	retreating	from	the	light	in	the	semi-darkness	of	the	house</p>
<p class="calibre1">next	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr	Lestrange	is	far	weirder	than	I	am.	It’s	much	creepier	for	a	grown	man	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	staring	at	a	fifteen-year-old	from	his	bedroom	window	than	it	is	for	me	to	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">it.	So	why	did	the	guard	confront	me	and	not	him? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 he	 realises.	 The	 guard	 didn’t	 confront	 Lestrange	 because	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">surveillance	gear	didn’t	detect	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later,	 as	 he	 sits	 with	 his	 mother	 while	 she	 eats	 her	 late-night	 supper,	 she notices	his	faraway	look.	“Penny	for	them,”	she	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>“Mr	Lestrange.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Him	again.	What	has	prompted	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	know	nothing	about	him.	Don’t	you	think	it’s	odd?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	mother	raises	an	eyebrow.	“No.	I	don’t	think	it’s	odd	at	all	that	you	don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">know	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Before	the	curfew,	did	he	leave	the	house?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don’t	 know,	 Mathew.	 I	 leave	 early	 in	 the	 morning	 and	 come	 back	 late	 at night.	You’re	more	likely	to	have	run	into	him	than	I	am.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	remember	ever	seeing	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	remember	noticing	Gen	walking	down	the	street?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	frowns.	“I’m	sure	I	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gen’s	 a	 bad	 example.	 You’ve	 known	 her	 since	 you	 were	 a	 baby.	 Do	 you</p>
<p class="calibre1">know	Mary	in	the	house	opposite?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	shakes	his	head.	“I	didn’t	even	know	there	was	a	Mary	opposite.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 you	 notice	 people.	 You	 must	 have	 spoken	 to	 Mr	 Lestrange	 at	 some</p>
<p class="calibre1">point,	over	the	garden	fence	or	in	the	porch.	Do	you	remember	what	he’s	like?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	searches	her	memory,	“D’you	know?	I	couldn’t	tell	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you	met	him,	didn’t	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	that	was	your	father.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	never	met	him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	to	think	of	it,	I	don’t	think	I	ever	have.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“I	won’t!”	he	shouts	after	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 shoves	 off	 his	 bedclothes,	 goes	 to	 the	 window,	 and	 watches	 his</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	sun	is	already	beating	down,	melting	the	tarmac.	The	doors	of	the	houses</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 Pickervance	 Road	 are	 all	 shut,	 and	 the	 street	 is	 deserted	 and	 still,	 as	 it	 has been	 each	 day	 of	 the	 All-Day	 Curfew.

<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 kitchen,	 Mathew	 allows	 Leibniz	 to	 make	 him	 breakfast,	 while	 he</p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 laughs,	 remembering	 what	 Cadmus	 Silverwood	 had	 said	 in	 the</p>

<p class="calibre1">They	are	there	to	keep	everyone	in	his	or	her	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	vaguely	thinks	about	what	Silverwood	said	about	the	war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leibniz	clears	the	dishes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	has	an	appointment	in	the	Darkroom.	Nan	Absolem	has	arranged	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">meeting	with	the	Russian	girl	who	builds	virtual	worlds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eva	Aslanova	is	slightly	younger	than	Mathew.	She	is	so	blonde	her	fine	hair</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 almost	 white,	 as	 white	 as	 her	 skin.	 In	 the	 Darkroom	 she	 sits	 in	 an	 armchair made	to	seem	enormous	by	her	tiny	frame.	She	frowns	constantly,	and	doing	so</p>

<p class="calibre1">watches	the	dragons	fly	around	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	did	you	make	dragons?”	she	asks	him.	There’s	only	a	tiny	delay	when</p>

<p class="calibre1">Shame	 the	 auto-translate	 function	 doesn’t	 work	 on	 manners	 and	 cultural</p>
<p class="calibre1">differences,	Mathew	thinks.	Eva	is	mercilessly	direct. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wanted	to	make	them	real.	Dragons	have	a	different	meaning	in	my	father</p>

<p class="calibre1">My	father	was	Danish.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“He’s	dead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eva	doesn’t	say	“I’m	sorry”	or	react	in	any	way	to	this	news.	Mathew	feels</p>
<p class="calibre1">relieved	and	grateful	because	it	means	he	doesn’t	have	to	reply,	“It’s	okay,”	as	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">normally	does.	Because	it	isn’t.	It	isn’t	okay	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	my	father’s	culture	dragons	are	evil	creatures	that	kill	and	terrify	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	have	to	be	defeated	by	a	brave	warrior.	In	my	grandmother’s	culture	they</p>

<p class="calibre1">“It	 may	 be	 what	 my	 grandmother	 thinks,	 but	 it’s	 not	 what	 I	 think.	 I’m</p>

<p class="calibre1">Eva	accepts	this,	or	is	too	bored	to	pursue	it.	“I	understand	why	you	wanted</p>

<p class="calibre1">he’d	 appreciate	 her	 approval,	 but	 in	 a	 way	 he	 does.	 She	 asks,	 “Why	 is	 your mother	Japanese	and	your	grandmother	Chinese?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 grandfather,	 my	 mother’s	 father,	 was	 a	 Japanese	 businessman.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">moved	to	China	for	a	job	and	never	left.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	how	did	your	mother	and	grandmother	come	to	England?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 mother	 came	 here	 on	 an	 internship.	 She	 works	 for	 Panacea’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">biotechnology	 division.	 They	 have	 offices	 in	 China	 and	 in	 most	 major	 cities worldwide.	 She	 wanted	 to	 visit	 England,	 because	 her	 secondary	 subject	 at</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>college	 was	 English.	 She	 only	 intended	 to	 come	 for	 a	 year,	 but	 she	 met	 my father,	and	they	fell	in	love	and	got	married.	Her	company	helped	with	the	visa</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrangements,	and	so	she	stayed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	why	is	your	grandmother	living	in	England?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	lives	in	Scotland	now,	but	she	came	a	few	years	after	my	mother,	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 grandfather	 died,	 to	 get	 away	 from	 the	 trouble	 in	 China	 caused	 by	 drought and	flooding.	My	mother	invited	her	for	a	long	holiday,	and	they	managed	to	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	indefinite	leave	to	remain	on	compassionate	grounds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	miss	your	father?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	I	do!	What	kind	of	question	is	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 a	 valid	 question.	 Just	 because	 he	 was	 your	 father	 it	 doesn’t	 mean	 you liked	him.	I	loathe	mine.	I	wouldn’t	care	if	he	wasn’t	here	anymore.	My	brothers</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	 all	 he	 cares	 about.	 They	 are	 all	 stupid	 and	 are	 still	 struggling	 to	 pass	 their foundation	 exams	 even	 though	 they	 are	 older	 than	 me.	 He’s	 a	 Neanderthal	 and thinks	women	don’t	need	to	be	educated	and	they’re	only	fit	to	be	wives.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	how	come	you	are	able	to	program	and	study?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	a	good	teacher,	and	my	mother	isn’t	as	docile	as	my	father	thinks	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	are	you	building	a	virtual	world?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	 I	 can,	 because	 it	 has	 all	 kinds	 of	 practical	 uses.	 It’s	 officially	 an environmental	project.	I’m	building	worlds	and	running	climate	models	in	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	test	the	impact	of	pollution	on	the	world’s	ecological	systems.	But	I	originally</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	wanted	to	build	a	world	with	no	people	in	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 really.	 Haven’t	 you	 ever	 wished	 you	 could	 have	 the	 world	 to	 yourself for	 a	 while?	 Haven’t	 you	 ever	 wished	 there	 were	 vast	 expanses	 of	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">unpopulated	world	for	you	to	explore	alone?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	you	come	to	mention	it,	it	is	appealing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	then,	you	won’t	want	my	dragons	wandering	around	in	your	world.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	an	issue,	is	it?	The	whole	point	of	my	project	is	that	I	replicate	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">worlds	 for	 scenario	 testing.	 We’ll	 mirror	 my	 world,	 and	 you	 can	 have	 two	 or more,	 as	 many	 as	 you	 like,	 parallel	 versions	 of	 it.	 Versions	 to	 split	 off	 and	 do different	things	with.	Whatever	you	imagine.	I	don’t	mind	if	we	clone	one	of	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">worlds	for	you	to	use.	I	think	it	might	be	interesting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 happens	 when	 you	 add	 new	 territories?	 Would	 they	 synch	 to	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">version?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	Your	dragons	will	have	an	ever-expanding	world	to	live	in,	rather	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	confined	to	your	house.	And	you’ll	be	able	to	meet	your	dragons	there	–</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>and	me	as	well,	if	you	like.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	like	it	very	much,	Eva	Aslanova.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	appears	we	have	a	project,	Mathew	Erlang.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eva	invites	Mathew	into	her	world.	He	gets	the	demigod	tour	rather	than	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">human	pedestrian	perspective,	to	give	him	a	sense	of	the	scale	of	it.	As	he	sits	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	comfort	of	his	Darkroom	seat,	his	brain	is	stimulated	by	the	skullcap,	and	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">senses	are	assaulted	and	fooled	by	the	complex	coordinated	technologies	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Darkroom.	 Eva	 takes	 his	 hand	 and	 flies	 him	 over	 fields,	 great	 empty	 plains, forests,	 deserts,	 seas,	 lakes,	 mountains,	 ancient	 dead	 snow-topped	 and	 active volcanoes.	 They	 dive	 under	 water	 and	 skim	 the	 colour-shock	 of	 coral	 reefs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	 she	 brings	 him	 to	 rest	 on	 a	 mountainside.	 They	 are	 staring	 across	 a valley,	 a	 deep	 gorge	 cut	 into	 the	 landscape,	 velveteen	 with	 green	 and	 studded with	trees.	Fluffy	white	clouds	cast	shadows	moving	ship-like	across	the	land. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s	 done	 this	 kind	 of	 thing	 before.	 Eva’s	 world	 isn’t	 unique,	 but	 there	 is something	 different,	 something	 pristine	 and	 innocent,	 plus,	 if	 he	 wants	 it,	 he’ll have	a	version	all	to	himself</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">8	O’Malley	Escapes</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Number	 nineteen	 and	 number	 twenty-one	 Pickervance	 Road	 are	 houses</p>
<p class="calibre1">nestling	against	one	another.	They	are	part	of	two	rows	of	Victorian	terraces	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">elaborate	 bay	 windows	 and	 tiled	 porches,	 set	 back	 from	 the	 road,	 with	 short redbrick	paths,	flower	borders,	and	garden	walls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	 front	 doors	 are	 right	 next	 to	 one	 another,	 making	 it	 all	 the	 more surprising	 that	 Mathew’s	 parents	 had	 never	 got	 to	 know	 Mr	 Lestrange.	 It	 also means	 that	 when	 Mathew	 puts	 his	 acoustic	 amplifier	 to	 the	 party	 wall	 between his	and	Mr	Lestrange’s	house,	he’s	recording	whatever	is	going	on	in	the	hallway</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	house	next	door,	which	appears	to	be	nothing	very	much	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 tries	 several	 places,	 upstairs	 and	 down,	 in	 the	 hope	 he	 might	 catch Mr	Lestrange	having	an	e-Pin	conversation	whilst	wandering	in	his	house,	but	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	greeted	with	nothing	but	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 sits	 on	 the	 staircase	 with	 his	 amplifier	 on	 his	 knees.	 It’s	 possible</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lestrange	has	soundproofed	the	party	walls.	He	goes	upstairs.	The	corner	of	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">bedroom	is	only	a	couple	of	feet	away	from	Mr	Lestrange’s	bay	window.	What	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	attaches	his	amplifier	to	the	wall?	Then	he’d	be	able	to	listen	directly	into	the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	window	in	Mathew’s	bedroom	hasn’t	opened	in	years.	Given	the	climate</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 the	 permanent	 need	 for	 either	 air	 conditioning	 or	 heating,	 hardly	 anyone opens	their	windows	these	days.	Mathew	climbs	onto	a	chair	he	fetches	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">kitchen	and	manages	to	force	the	window	ajar.	He	has	fashioned	a	kind	of	hook</p>
<p class="calibre1">attached	to	the	wire	he	wraps	round	the	amplifier,	intending	this	to	fasten	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pipe	 clips	 on	 the	 drainpipe	 running	 between	 their	 two	 houses.	 Leaning</p>
<p class="calibre1">precariously,	 he	 manages	 to	 fix	 the	 amplifier	 in	 place,	 but	 as	 he	 gets	 back	 in through	the	window,	trying	to	thread	the	wire	with	him,	he	slips,	the	stool	going</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	under	his	feet.	Grabbing	the	window	ledge	before	he	falls,	he	dislodges	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">precariously	attached	amplifier	and	sends	the	whole	thing	hurtling	into	the	olive</p>
<p class="calibre1">tree	growing	next	to	the	front	room	windows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Damn!”	 He	 drops	 to	 the	 floorboards	 and	 jogs	 downstairs,	 taking	 his	 stool with	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First	 he	 goes	 into	 the	 garden	 to	 try	 and	 retrieve	 the	 amplifier	 from	 the	 tree, but	he	can’t	reach	it.	It’s	stuck	in	the	crook	of	two	branches	growing	against	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">side	of	the	house.	He	realises	he	would	be	able	to	get	at	it	if	he	stretched	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	window	in	the	front	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Downstairs,	he	thumps	the	window	open.	It	was	as	stuck	as	the	one	upstairs, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 he	 manages	 to	 force	 it	 and	 leans	 across	 to	 grab	 the	 amplifier.	 As	 he	 does, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>O’Malley,	whom	he’s	totally	forgotten	about,	bounds	off	the	window	ledge	onto his	shoulder	and	out	through	the	window.	Mathew	drops	the	amplifier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Damn	cat!”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	opens	the	front	door	and	goes	into	the	street.	As	always,	the	heat	hits	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	a	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">O’Malley	has	disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	garden	he	starts	searching	on	his	hands	and	knees	under	the	juniper	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">rosemary	bushes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“O’Malley?	 O’Malley!”	 he	 calls,	 increasingly	 loudly,	 half-expecting	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">entire	 neighbourhood	 to	 come	 and	 tell	 him	 to	 get	 indoors.	 It	 crosses	 his	 mind that	he	may	be	breaking	the	terms	of	the	All-Day	Curfew.	“O’Malley?”	he	says</p>
<p class="calibre1">again.	O’Malley’s	distinct	mew	calls	back	to	him,	more	half-strangled	duck	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">cat.	“Good	boy,	come	here.	Come	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mew,”	says	O’Malley,	but	he	doesn’t	appear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	thinks	the	meow	is	coming	from	Gen’s	garden,	and	he	peers	over	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fence	separating	their	properties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“O’Malley,	come	here,”	he	says,	aiming	his	voice	at	the	garden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mao,”	 O’Malley	 says,	 but	 this	 time	 Mathew	 catches	 something	 moving	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	bushes	on	the	far	side	of	Gen’s	path. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 bare	 feet	 burn	 on	 the	 pavement	 as	 he	 heads	 for	 Gen’s	 garden	 gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wondering	 if	 he	 should	 knock	 before	 he	 searches	 through	 her	 shrubbery,	 he decides	he	doesn’t	have	time	and	will	explain	if	she	comes.	He	gets	on	his	hands</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 knees	 and	 starts	 lifting	 branches.	 In	 the	 corner	 of	 the	 wall,	 under	 a	 laurel bush,	O’Malley’s	turquoise	eyes	glimmer.	Mathew	pats	the	soil	in	front	of	him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,	come	on.”	Finding	a	broken	twig,	he	starts	waving	it	in	front	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cat.	O’Malley	obligingly	responds	and	swats	at	the	stick	with	his	paw.	Mathew</p>
<p class="calibre1">slowly	draws	the	waving	stick	towards	him,	and	O’Malley	edges	forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	move	or	I’ll	blow	your	bloody	brains	out!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow	Mathew	is	now	face	down,	with	his	cheek	ignominiously	pressed</p>
<p class="calibre1">onto	 a	 hot	 paving	 stone,	 his	 arm	 painfully	 pinned	 behind	 his	 back,	 a	 heavy weight	 pressing	 on	 his	 spine	 and	 something	 hard,	 metal,	 and	 definitely	 life-threatening	pushed	into	the	side	of	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“ID!”	barks	what	Mathew	assumes	to	be	the	man	kneeling	on	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	Mathew	says,	struggling	to	breathe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	 is	 your	 ID	 card?”	 the	 man	 punctuates	 each	 word	 with	 additional</p>
<p class="calibre1">pressure	from	his	knee,	so	Mathew	involuntarily	finds	himself	groaning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	in	the	house.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	it	doing	there?	All	citizens	must	carry	their	ID	at	all	times	with	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">during	the	All-Day	Curfew.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>“I	didn’t	think	I’d	need	it	to	hunt	for	my	cat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	cat	escaped.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	no	cat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	 under	 there.”	 Mathew	 tries	 to	 lift	 his	 arm	 to	 point	 but	 the	 man	 slams him	against	the	paving	stone	hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	on	earth	is	going	on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	is	another	voice.	A	woman.	A	voice	of	reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew’s	eyes,	at	ground	level,	see	a	pair	of	women’s	shoes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	on	earth	are	you	kneeling	on	my	neighbour’s	son	and	pointing	a	gun	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	head?	Are	you	mad?”	It’s	Gen	Lacey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	 stand	 back.	 This	 boy	 is	 wandering	 around	 without	 ID	 during	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">government	 curfew,	 a	 criminal	 offence	 under	 the	 Special	 Measures	 Act	 2042. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 same	 boy	 I	 observed	 wearing	 Lenzes	 and	 spying	 on	 my	 client	 yesterday, which	is	not	only	highly	suspicious	behaviour,	it	is	also	a	criminal	offence	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Personal	Privacy	Act	2035.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gen	 says,	 “He’s	 Mathew	 Erlang,	 an	 educational	 apprentice	 to	 Hermes	 Link</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	son	of	Hoshi	Mori,	senior	researcher	at	Panacea.	I	don’t	think	anyone	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	especially	happy	if	you	arrested	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	making	an	arrest	until	his	identity	is	vouched	for.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 <i class="calibre4">am</i>	vouching	for	his	identity.	I	have	told	you	who	he	is.	Please	listen.	I	live here.	 You	 have	 seen	 me	 each	 day	 for	 the	 last	 year.	 So	 you	 should	 be	 able	 to vouch	for	 <i class="calibre4">my</i>	identity,	at	least.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	don’t	abuse	me,	madam.	I	am	authorised	to	use	my	weapon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	abusing	you.	I’m	helping	you.	You	are	assaulting	a	sixteen-year-old</p>
<p class="calibre1">boy	out	searching	for	his	cat,	and	I	am	trying	to	get	you	to	stop	before	you	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	you	will	regret.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maow,”	O’Malley	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	was	that?”	the	guard	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	cat,”	Mathew	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 still	 can’t	 turn	 his	 head	 but	 hears	 a	 third	 voice,	 a	 strange	 but	 calm, soothing	voice.	It	says,	“I	think	we	should	stop	this	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 metal	 is	 lifted	 from	 the	 side	 of	 Mathew’s	 head.	 The	 knee	 is	 removed from	his	chest.	He	turns	on	the	pavement,	onto	his	back,	and	gapes	up.	Briefly</p>
<p class="calibre1">registering	 Clara	 staring	 imperiousl <i class="calibre4">y</i>	 down	 at	 him,	 his	 eyes	 are	 drawn	 to	 Mr Lestrange.	 He	 has	 the	 muzzle	 of	 the	 machine	 gun	 in	 his	 hand	 and	 is	 gently handing	it	back	to	the	guard,	who	now	has	a	puzzled	but	soft	look	on	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr	Lestrange	actually	takes	the	guard’s	hand	in	his	and	places	the	muzzle	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">gun	 there,	 wrapping	 his	 fingers	 around	 it.	 “I	 think	 you	 should	 go	 back	 to	 your</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>car	now.	Come	back	at	five	o’clock	to	collect	Clara.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right.”	 The	 guard	 hesitates	 for	 a	 moment	 and	 then	 retreats	 to	 the	 car, </p>
<p class="calibre1">glancing	 over	 his	 shoulder,	 puzzled.	 They	 watch	 from	 Gen’s	 garden	 as	 the	 car drives	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gen	hurries	to	Mathew	and	helps	him	to	his	feet.	“Are	you	okay?”	she	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">O’Malley	comes	from	under	the	bushes	and	rubs	against	his	ankles.	Mathew</p>
<p class="calibre1">bends	and	picks	him	up.	“I’m	fine,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">O’Malley	starts	to	purr	loudly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr	Lestrange	is	tall	and	thin,	dressed	conservatively	but	not	oddly.	His	face	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">long,	his	skin	pale,	almost	translucent,	the	skin	of	someone	rarely	touched	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sun.	 He	 is	 clean-shaven	 and	 of	 an	 indeterminate	 age.	 His	 eyes	 are	 dark	 and framed	by	extraordinarily	long,	thick	eyelashes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	realises	too	late	that	he	is	staring	open-mouthed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr	 Lestrange	 has	 something	 in	 his	 hand.	 Mathew	 doesn’t	 know	 where	 it</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	from	because	he	didn’t	notice	it	when	he	was	talking	to	the	guard.	It’s	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">acoustic	 amplifier	 and	 a	 tangle	 of	 wire.	 Mr	 Lestrange	 hands	 it	 to	 him	 silently, with	the	faintest	hint	of	a	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gen	Lacey	has	opened	the	front	door	and	is	guiding	Clara	through	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mathew,	come	in	for	a	minute.	I’ll	make	you	some	hot	tea.	You	must	be	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">shock.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 is	 still	 staring	 at	 Mr	 Lestrange.	 Indiscernibly,	 he	 urges	 Mathew</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward,	 so	 he	 finds	 himself	 walking	 towards	 Gen	 Lacey’s	 beckoning	 hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">without	consciously	planning	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	my	fault.	I’m	sorry.	But	I	think	it	will	be	alright,”	Mr	Lestrange	says</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	if	talking	to	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	is	distracted	by	Gen,	who’s	ushering	him	into	the	house	and	helping</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	with	his	complicated	burden	of	the	cat	and	a	bundle	of	wires. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turns	back	again,	but	Mr	Lestrange	has	disappeared	through	his	own	front</p>
<p class="calibre1">door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clara	and	Mathew	are	in	Gen	Lacey’s	large	front	room.	Gen	doesn’t	have	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">HomeAngel	–	she	says	the	Royal	College	of	Music	doesn’t	have	the	budget	–	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 has	 gone	 off	 to	 make	 the	 tea	 herself.	 They	 are	 sitting	 on	 either	 end	 of	 the sofa,	 something	 Mathew	 is	 grateful	 for	 because	 as	 they	 walked	 in,	 he	 realised Clara	was	taller	than	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	are	both	staring	at	the	grand	piano.	He	glances	across	at	her.	She	has	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">long	nose	and	freckles,	three	dark	moles	on	her	cheek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	you	were	watching	me?”	she	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>Mathew	feels	unwell.	“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	did	the	guard	say	you	were	watching	me	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	man’s	a	psycho.	You	saw	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	takes	care	of	me	when	I	travel	and	is	nothing	but	nice	to	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	nice	man	had	me	pinned	to	the	floor	with	a	gun	to	my	head.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	quite	extreme,”	Clara	admits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	it	 <i class="calibre4">felt</i>	quite	extreme.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	he	must	have	had	a	reason.	What	were	you	doing	sneaking	around	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	searching	for	him,”	he	says	nodding	in	the	direction	of	O’Malley,	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">jumps	 onto	 the	 piano	 stool.	 He	 explores	 the	 room,	 his	 legs	 retracted	 to	 short stumps	 in	 fear,	 his	 neck	 extended	 in	 curiosity,	 starting	 back	 as	 he	 encounters each	 new	 thing.	 Mathew	 gets	 up	 and	 retrieves	 him	 before	 he	 jumps	 onto	 the piano. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	pretty	cat,”	Clara	says.	“Is	it	a	Siamese?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“His	name	is	O’Malley,	and	he’s	half-Siamese,”	Mathew	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	it’s	a	he.	Isn’t	he	allowed	into	the	garden?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Used	to	be,	but	he	has	to	stay	in	now	because	of	the	birds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	birds?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	government	passed	a	law	making	it	illegal	to	kill	birds	and	included	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">house	 cat	 clause.	 So	 he’s	 now	 shut	 away	 in	 the	 house	 all	 the	 time	 and	 doesn’t understand,	and	he’s	always	trying	to	run	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">O’Malley	is	straining	to	get	at	Clara.	She	extends	one	of	her	long	hands	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">strokes	him.	Mathew	is	holding	O’Malley	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	okay,	I	love	animals,”	she	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Released,	the	cat	climbs	onto	her	lap	and	starts	to	purr	like	he	has	a	motor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 likes	 you,”	 Mathew	 says,	 wanting	 to	 tell	 her	 how	 much	 he	 enjoys</p>
<p class="calibre1">listening	to	her	playing,	but	he	doesn’t	know	how	to	form	the	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	says,	“You’re	the	weirdo.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yesterday	 the	 guard	 said	 someone	 was	 watching	 me,	 and	 it	 was	 you.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">called	you	a	weirdo.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 happened	 to	 be	 at	 my	 window	 when	 you	 arrived.	 I	 wasn’t	 watching	 you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alright?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	would	he	say	that	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	hesitates.	“It	might	have	appeared	like	I	was	watching	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 raises	 an	 eyebrow	 and	 assesses	 him	 sceptically.	 “Right,”	 she	 says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whatever	 you	 do	 that	 makes	 him	 think	 that,	 can	 you	 stop,	 please?	 I’m	 too spooked	 out	 by	 everything	 going	 on	 at	 the	 moment	 with	 the	 government.	 My</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>parents	 are	 on	 some	 frickin	 watch	 list,	 and	 the	 last	 thing	 I	 need	 is	 a	 teenaged stalker.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew’s	 face	 colours	 purple.	 “I	 am	 not	 watching	 you,	 but	 if	 you	 want	 to know	 the	 truth,	 the	 man	 who	 lives	 next	 door	 to	 me,	 the	 one	 you	 just	 met,	 has been	 at	 his	 window	 each	 time	 you	 came	 and	 went	 ever	 since	 I’ve	 been	 home from	school,	and	your	awesome	guard	hasn’t	even	noticed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	making	it	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	 you	 don’t	 believe	 me,	 come	 and	 see.	 When	 you’ve	 finished	 your	 lesson here,	come	round	and	I’ll	show	you.”	He	stands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gen	comes	through	the	door	with	a	tray	of	tea.	She	glances	between	the	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	them	curiously.	“Everything	alright	here?”	she	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,”	Clara	says,	smiling	brightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	are	you?”	Gen	asks,	frowning	at	Mathew	with	concern.	“Shouldn’t	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	sitting?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	fine,”	Mathew	says.	“I	should	be	going.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stay	and	have	some	tea,	at	least.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	shakes	his	head.	“I’ve	disturbed	your	lesson.	I	should	leave.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	should	call	your	mother,”	Gen	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 please	 don’t.	 She’s	 so	 busy.	 She’d	 worry	 and	 come	 home,	 and	 there’s nothing	she	can	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	make	a	complaint.	That	guard	was	crazy,”	Gen	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	no	need,”	Mathew	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	I	was	young,	the	police	weren’t	thugs,”	Gen	says.	“They	didn’t	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">guns,	 and	 the	 whole	 country	 understood	 why.	 These	 days,	 I’m	 sure	 they	 hire	 a lot	 of	 these	 men	 straight	 from	 the	 criminal	 courts.	 Convicted	 criminals	 get	 the choice	of	joining	the	army	or	the	security	services	rather	than	prison	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	think	Mr	Lestrange	works	for	the	police?”	Mathew	asks	Gen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr	Lestrange?!	Why	on	earth	do	you	ask	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	he	is	always	watching	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	you,	you	mean?”	Clara	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gen	says,	“Clara,	I	am	sure	Mathew	wasn’t	watching	you.	Not	intentionally, </p>
<p class="calibre1">anyway.	And	Mr	Lestrange	isn’t	a	policeman.	He’s	some	kind	of	historian.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	what	my	mum	says.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	got	an	impressive	library,	you	know,	of	old-fashioned	paper	books.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	you	know?	Were	you	in	his	house?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	 Once.	 When	 I	 was	 doing	 my	 stint	 as	 neighbourhood	 watch	 organiser. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	know,	it	rotates	around	all	the	adults	in	the	street.	Even	your	mum	has	done</p>
<p class="calibre1">it.	 The	 local	 police	 were	 doing	 a	 sweep	 of	 houses,	 the	 usual	 thing,	 people harbouring	 illegal	 immigrants,	 and	 I	 had	 to	 accompany	 the	 police	 around	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>houses	to	make	sure	they	didn’t	damage	anything	while	they	searched.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	was	his	house	like?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	 this	 one.	 Actually,	 no,	 more	 like	 yours.	 He	 has	 a	 Darkroom,	 I	 don’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 his	 front	 room	 is	 this	 wonderful	 library,	 full	 of	 beautifully	 bound	 books. </p>
<p class="calibre1">History	books,	he	said.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	there	was	nothing	odd?	No	strange	equipment?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	notice	anything,	no.	I	think	he’s	fairly	ordinary.	People	always	think</p>
<p class="calibre1">people	 living	 on	 their	 own	 and	 who	 keep	 to	 themselves,	 are	 suspect,	 but	 he’s harmless.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	he’s	harmless	at	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	of	the	way	the	guard	reacted	to	him.	When	you	spoke	to	him,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">guard	 was	 getting	 angrier.	 When	 Mr	 Lestrange	 spoke	 to	 him,	 he	 immediately backed	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	it	was	a	man	thing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	.	.	.	but	I	don’t	think	so.	It	was	odd.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	entire	thing	was	odd,”	Gen	says.	“How	did	O’Malley	escape,	anyway?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Through	the	living	room	window.	I	had	dropped	.	.	.	something	in	the	tree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	a	long	story	.	.	.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that	the	thing	you	dropped?”	Clara	asks,	pointing	to	the	amplifier	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wire	bundle	in	Mathew’s	arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	an	amplifier.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mathew	is	a	science	scholar,”	Gen	explains	to	Clara. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	 really	 better	 go,”	 he	 says.	 “I’m	 sorry	 to	 have	 disturbed	 you.	 Come	 on, O’Malley,”	 he	 says	 to	 the	 cat.	 O’Malley	 is	 happily	 curled	 on	 Clara’s	 lap	 and doesn’t	want	to	move.	Mathew	isn’t	sure	how	to	retrieve	him.	Clara	scoops	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	her	arms	and	offers	him	to	Mathew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,”	Mathew	says.	She	doesn’t	meet	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gen	stands	and	shows	Mathew	to	the	door.	“Don’t	let	go	of	him	until	you	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	house.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	won’t,”	he	says.	“I’m	hanging	on	for	dear	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back	 in	 his	 room,	 Mathew	 finds	 Mr	 Lestrange	 playing	 on	 his	 mind	 as	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">works	on	the	amplifier.	He	decides	it’s	too	much	trouble	to	fix	the	amplifier	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">finds	a	new	design	with	hooks	built	in.	While	it’s	printing,	he	starts	to	search	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Nexus	for	Mr	Lestrange. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 Nexus	 is	 so	 ubiquitous,	 even	 the	 most	 tech-averse	 person	 is	 on	 it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>somewhere.	But	Mr	Lestrange	is	not	on	the	electoral	register.	He’s	not	a	member of	 any	 social	 network.	 Lestrange	 the	 historian	 hasn’t	 published	 any	 academic papers.	 There’s	 no	 Professor	 Lestrange	 registered	 as	 teaching	 at	 any	 school	 or university,	 in	 London	 or	 internationally.	 There	 are	 no	 random	 photos,	 either, taken	by	a	colleague,	friend,	or	family	member	and	tagged.	It’s	impossible	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone	 hasn’t	 captured	 him	 on	 camera	 or	 film	 or	 commented	 on	 him</p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhere.	 Mathew	 tries	 every	 variation	 of	 Lestrange’s	 name	 he	 can	 think	 of, tries	 searching	 for	 his	 address,	 but	 as	 far	 as	 the	 Nexus	 is	 concerned,	 Lestrange doesn’t	exist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 3D	 printer	 has	 completed	 its	 run.	 Mathew	 tests	 the	 new	 amplifier	 and connects	again	in	the	living	room,	ready	for	Clara’s	lesson	the	next	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 nine	 o’clock,	 just	 as	 he’s	 finishing,	 he	 receives	 an	 alert	 from	 the	 social network	 Consort,	 of	 a	 connection	 request.	 He	 hardly	 ever	 uses	 Consort.	 It’s	 a cross	 between	 a	 school	 playground	 and	 a	 human	 meat	 market,	 full	 of	 tribes, shallow	relationships,	and	vapid	content.	He’d	like	to	terminate	his	account	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">doing	so	is	tantamount	to	dying	online.	And,	bizarrely,	the	account	is	unofficially</p>
<p class="calibre1">required	for	college	and	employment	applications. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Requests	 come	 in	 from	 random	 people	 all	 the	 time,	 and	 he	 ignores	 most	 of them	–	they	barely	register	with	him	–	but	Clara’s	name	catches	his	eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Accept,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clara	is	there	online,	waiting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,”	she	says.	“I	wasn’t	sure	you’d	accept.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	did	you	think	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	of	the	way	I	spoke	to	you.	I	was	rude.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	you	were.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 pauses	 and	 then	 says,	 “Anyway,	 after	 you	 left,	 Gen	 and	 I	 chatted.	 So	 I wanted	to	apologise	and	to	explain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	have	to.”	He’s	wondering	what	Gen	said,	guessing	she	told	Clara</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	his	father	and	now	she	is	sorry	for	him.	He	hopes	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	want	to.	Please	let	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	ahead.”	His	voice	comes	out	colder	than	he	means	it	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	here,”	she	says.	“Can	I	come	and	see	you	sometime,	in	your	house?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure.	Just	come	after	your	lesson.	I’m	stuck	here,	remember.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later,	Mathew	logs	onto	the	Blackweb	and	searches	for	Mr	Lestrange	using</p>
<p class="calibre1">MUUT,	the	Blackweb	search	engine.	His	search	returns	zero	results. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I	need	help, </i>	he	thinks. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">9	Drowned	London</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">DAY	THREE:	Wednesday,	24	November	2055,	London</p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	of	the	Thames	bridges	are	closed.	The	tunnels	are	all	flooded.	There	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	a	few	options	for	getting	across	the	river,	to	reach	Mathew’s	school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nan	 Absolem	 has	 arranged	 for	 a	 car	 to	 come	 and	 collect	 him.	 It’s	 an	 Aegis car,	 like	 the	 one	 his	 Mother	 and	 Clara	 travel	 in.	 It	 comes	 with	 a	 guard,	 too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	gingerly	steps	past	him,	as	he	gets	into	the	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	 dragon	 zips	 inside	 in	 front	 of	 him,	 but	 the	 guard	 shuts	 the	 door	 on	 the other.	 There	 is	 nothing	 stopping	 the	 dragon	 from	 getting	 into	 the	 car,	 but	 it believes	 it	 is	 left	 behind.	 Mathew	 opens	 the	 window	 slightly	 and	 the	 dragon squeezes	 in.	 The	 guard,	 sitting	 in	 the	 front,	 opens	 the	 glass	 panel	 separating them,	glances	over	his	shoulder,	and	says,	“Alright?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	fine,”	Mathew	says.	“I	was	just	testing	the	windows.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,”	the	guard	says,	sniffing	as	he	turns	back	to	face	the	road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	has	the	black	fake-leather	upholstered	seats	in	the	main	body	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">car	to	himself.	Like	all	cars,	this	one	is	arranged	inside	like	a	mini-living	room, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with	two	two-seater	sofas	facing	one	another	and	a	coffee	table,	which	doubles</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	a	holovision,	in	between. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	backs	of	the	doors	and	windows	are	a	form	of	unbreakable	glass	and	act</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	screens.	Right	now	they	surround	Mathew	with	a	forest	scene	–	a	lake,	trees, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	a	blue	sky	–	but	they	are	connected	to	the	Nexus	and	can	display	any	web</p>
<p class="calibre1">page,	 TV	 channel,	 or	 video.	 He	 changes	 the	 display	 so	 he	 can	 see	 the	 world outside,	 and	 the	 forest	 melts	 away	 to	 reveal	 houses,	 pavements,	 and	 the	 road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	view	is	only	one	way.	Aegis	assumes	its	customers	want	anonymity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	cars	don’t	have	a	front	seat	at	all.	The	only	reason	the	Aegis	cars	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">seats	in	the	front	is	because	they	come	with	armed	guards.	The	security	company</p>
<p class="calibre1">found	 that	 its	 clients	 were	 unable	 to	 relax	 sitting	 in	 the	 back	 of	 a	 car	 next	 to	 a man	with	a	machine	gun	balanced	on	his	knees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Normally,	 Mathew	 would	 get	 to	 school	 using	 public	 transport,	 but	 all	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tubes	and	train	lines	are	shut.	This	has	happened	before	–	the	flood,	the	transport</p>
<p class="calibre1">system	being	brought	to	a	standstill	–	but	when	it	did,	he	went	to	a	school	nearer</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	house	and	he	walked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	leave	Pickervance	Road.	All	the	shops	and	cafes	on	the	high	street	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">shut.	 Some	 are	 boarded	 up	 against	 looters	 coming	 from	 the	 riverside	 and	 the makeshift	camp	in	the	park	and	on	the	common.	One	or	two	of	the	shops	look</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>like	they’ve	been	looted.	There’s	an	armed	policeman	walking	to	and	fro	along the	 pavement.	 He	 guards	 whatever	 remains	 of	 the	 stock	 and	 the	 robotic	 shop assistants.	 People	 rarely	 work	 in	 shops	 anymore.	 All	 the	 shops	 are	 owned	 by corporates	and	are	fully	automated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew’s	 mother	 had	 described	 the	 camp,	 but	 he	 found	 it	 impossible	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagine.	They	drive	past	it	now,	and	he’s	unprepared	for	what	he	sees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tents,	 tarpaulins,	 and	 makeshift	 shelters	 cover	 the	 whole	 of	 Blackheath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Litter	 blows	 across	 the	 patchwork	 of	 grass	 and	 mud	 remains	 of	 the	 ancient common,	 collecting	 in	 piles.	 People	 sit	 on	 the	 edge	 of	 the	 road	 looking	 shell-shocked;	others	stand	around	between	the	tents.	There	is	a	long	queue	at	a	pipe</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	a	tap	at	the	end	attached	to	a	wooden	stake.	People	are	waiting	with	buckets</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 old	 milk	 cartons,	 bowls,	 and	 containers	 of	 all	 kinds.	 There’s	 another	 long queue	at	a	bank	of	Portaloos.	A	sign	above	one	marquee	says,	“Food	supplies,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	there’s	nothing	but	a	table	and	some	empty	boxes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	flooding	happened	ten	days	ago.	On	the	news	the	prime	minister	assured</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	interviewer	that	the	government	would	provide	food,	shelter,	and	water	to	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	flood	victims,	and	that	they	would	be	re-homed	within	a	week.	There	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 no	 repeat	 of	 what	 happened	 during	 previous	 floods,	 when	 people	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">without	 shelter	 for	 months	 and	 there	 was	 rioting	 and	 even	 an	 outbreak	 of cholera. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 world	 rolls	 on	 like	 a	 film	 from	 behind	 the	 tinted	 glass	 screens	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew’s	car.	He	has	to	tell	himself,	This	is	real;	This	could	be	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	turn	and	drive	across	the	common,	towards	the	park.	There	are	people</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	road.	The	car	slows,	and	its	on-board	computer	registers	the	obstacle	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sounds	a	horn,	driving	forward	all	the	time.	Most	of	the	people	scatter.	One	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 a	 suit	 that’s	 crumpled	 like	 it’s	 been	 slept	 in	 for	 the	 last	 ten	 nights	 turns	 and kicks	 the	 car,	 swearing	 angrily.	 A	 policeman	 marches	 towards	 him.	 Mathew</p>
<p class="calibre1">turns	 to	 the	 back	 window	 to	 see	 what	 happens	 next,	 but	 the	 car	 drives	 away down	the	hill,	and	the	man	and	the	policeman	are	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 wind	 their	 way	 to	 the	 river.	 The	 flood	 level	 is	 dropping,	 and	 people whose	 houses	 were	 swamped	 are	 clearing	 the	 mess	 as	 the	 water	 retreats	 from their	 homes.	 Mattresses	 are	 pulled	 over	 walls	 to	 dry.	 Piles	 of	 ruined	 household things	 lie	 around	 with	 detritus	 from	 the	 river	 –	 branches,	 leaves,	 sodden	 paper, fabric,	 cans,	 bottles,	 and	 sludge.	 The	 car	 pauses	 while	 people	 walk	 across	 the road	carrying	a	table,	and	Mathew	gazes	straight	into	the	eyes	of	an	old	woman</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>sitting	 on	 the	 wall	 of	 her	 house.	 It’s	 as	 if	 she’s	 staring	 at	 him,	 and	 he	 has	 to remind	himself	that	she	wouldn’t	be	able	to	see	through	the	tinted	glass.	She	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	 expression	 of	 total	 despair	 on	 her	 face.	 Mathew	 wants	 to	 open	 his	 door	 and help,	but	the	car	drives	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Down	one	of	the	streets,	next	to	some	half-flooded	factory	buildings,	there’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	makeshift	ferry.	Like	Aegis,	many	entrepreneurial	people	are	finding	ways	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">benefitting	from	the	disaster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 car	 stops,	 and	 the	 guard	 does	 a	 quick	 check	 of	 the	 area,	 walking	 to	 the water’s	 edge	 to	 talk	 to	 the	 ferryman,	 before	 he	 comes	 back	 to	 open	 Mathew’s door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	with	that	man,”	he	says,	pointing.	“You’ll	be	safe.	The	boat	will	take	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	Embankment.	There’ll	be	another	car	waiting	for	you	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	looks	at	the	ferryman,	a	man	in	his	twenties,	small	and	scrawny	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">muscled	and	heavily	tattooed.	He	isn’t	confident	about	going	with	this	man	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">glances	 back	 uncertainly	 at	 his	 guard,	 now	 the	 most	 reassuring	 figure</p>
<p class="calibre1">imaginable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	a	tracker	on	you,”	the	guard	says.	“We	know	where	you	are	at	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">times.	We’ll	be	waiting	for	you	when	you	come	back	this	afternoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 boat’s	 this	 way,”	 says	 the	 ferryman.	 Mathew	 has	 no	 choice	 but	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">follow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 small	 number	 of	 people	 are	 waiting	 in	 a	 makeshift	 shelter	 by	 the	 water’s edge.	 They	 are	 “respectable”	 people	 in	 suits	 and	 clean	 clothes.	 Mathew	 finds himself	thinking	he	will	be	safe	with	these	people.	The	group	is	silent.	They	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 shocked	 and	 uncomfortable	 as	 he	 is.	 The	 stench	 from	 the	 river	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">overpowering,	 and	 many	 of	 them	 are	 holding	 their	 ties	 or	 t-shirts	 across	 their mouth	 and	 nose.	 When	 the	 riverside	 streets	 of	 London	 flooded,	 so	 did	 the sewers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	group	is	waiting	for	Mathew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 the	 water’s	 edge	 a	 boat,	 forty	 feet	 long	 and	 half	 as	 wide,	 sits	 low	 in	 the water.	In	the	back	stands	a	guard	in	black	combats,	a	machine	gun	hanging	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	arm	casually,	like	a	kit	bag	or	a	coat.	The	ferryman	steadies	a	rickety	wooden</p>
<p class="calibre1">walkway	 leading	 onto	 the	 boat	 and	 helps	 the	 passengers	 on.	 On	 the	 deck	 an assortment	of	plastic	and	wooden	chairs,	crates	and	boxes	serve	as	seats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 they	 have	 all	 found	 somewhere	 to	 sit,	 a	 young	 boy,	 from	 the	 look	 of him	 the	 ferryman’s	 brother,	 or	 perhaps	 even	 his	 son,	 hands	 them	 all	 umbrellas, mostly	old-fashioned	black	ones.	“To	keep	the	sun	off,”	the	boy	says.	It’s	a	novel</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>idea	 of	 service,	 Mathew	 thinks,	 opening	 his	 gratefully.	 It’s	 already	 hot.	 His umbrella	has	a	broken	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ferryman	starts	the	engine.	The	boy	pulls	in	the	wooden	ramp,	then	runs</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	front	of	the	boat	and	jumps	off	onto	dry	land.	He	pushes	the	boat	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">water	 until	 he	 is	 waist	 deep	 and	 then	 heaves	 himself	 up,	 head	 first,	 his	 legs dangling	in	the	air.	Mathew	doesn’t	want	to	know	what	the	boy	was	wading	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	finds	himself	pulling	his	t-shirt	over	his	nose,	like	the	others,	and	breathes	in the	clean	detergent	smell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	boat	powers	away	from	the	shore	and	heads	into	the	centre	of	the	river, </p>
<p class="calibre1">racing	along,	the	current	behind	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	has	travelled	along	the	river	many	times	in	ferryboats	in	better	times, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 the	 Thames	 is	 transformed.	 It	 was	 never	 a	 pretty	 river.	 It	 was	 always	 too powerful	and	at	high	tide	slightly	disturbing,	like	a	wild	animal	running	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	heart	of	civilisation.	Now	it	is	positively	feral,	spreading	its	arms	anywhere</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	grab	at	the	land. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Royal	Naval	College	is	half-submerged,	buildings	sunk	beneath	the	thick</p>
<p class="calibre1">brown	 water	 lapping	 through	 broken	 windows	 and	 tugging	 on	 sodden	 curtains. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 old	 tea	 clipper,	 the	 Cutty	 Sark,	 is	 on	 one	 final	 voyage,	 its	 glass	 skirt shattered	 by	 the	 force	 of	 the	 incoming	 water,	 steel	 ties	 worked	 loose.	 It	 sails again	along	the	Thames,	a	ghost	ship,	rigging	flapping,	its	Muntz	metal	bottom</p>
<p class="calibre1">glistening	in	the	sunshine	as	it	cuts	through	the	muddy	sludge	of	the	river.	The</p>

<p class="calibre1">north	across	the	river	to	the	strange,	newly	formed	wetlands	of	the	Isle	of	Dogs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	South	Dock	Marina	and	Greenland	Dock	have	been	breached,	boats	sunk</p>

<p class="calibre1">reflected	 in	 the	 newly	 formed	 lake	 washing	 the	 panes	 of	 the	 glass	 sides	 of	 the first	four	stories.	It’s	a	city	of	mirrors	floating	in	the	sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	they	travel	on,	the	boatman	expertly	dodging	flotsam,	they	see	more	crew-</p>
<p class="calibre1">less	 yachts	 cut	 loose	 from	 London’s	 many	 marinas,	 along	 with	 uprooted	 trees, branches,	 park	 benches,	 and	 furniture	 washed	 from	 riverside	 homes.	 The</p>

<p class="calibre1">Then	he	cuts	the	engine,	and	they	watch	him	push	away	a	strange	bundle.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">turns	in	the	water,	and	Mathew	sees	it	is	a	distended	corpse,	made	bloated	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">grotesque	by	days	in	the	river. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shouldn’t	we	pull	it	out?”	someone	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>The	boatman	turns	and	grins.	“Do	ya	want	it	sittin'	wif	ya?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	one	voice	of	conscience	is	silenced,	and	no	one	else	speaks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	body	is	taken	into	the	current,	just	another	piece	of	flood	debris,	and	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">power	away	from	it,	the	smell	lingering	long	enough	for	them	all	to	find	it	hard</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	forget. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	pass	a	block	of	flats	where	people	have	made	a	camp	on	the	roof,	a	fire</p>
<p class="calibre1">burning	smokily	away.	A	boat	is	tethered	to	the	wall,	and	someone	is	returning</p>
<p class="calibre1">via	 the	 unsubmerged	 part	 of	 a	 fire	 escape.	 Then	 Mathew	 notices	 that	 many waterside	rooftops	have	people	on	them,	with	improvised	shelters	built	to	protect</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	from	the	rain	and	the	sun.	Even	though	it	is	November,	the	sun	is	harsh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	do	they	stay?”	one	of	the	passengers	asks	a	companion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nowhere	else	to	go.	Or	to	protect	their	stuff.	There’s	so	much	looting.	Who</p>
<p class="calibre1">knows	what	you	would	do	if	this	happened	to	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	river’s	miles	from	my	house.	It	will	never	happen	to	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 police	 boat	 powers	 past	 them,	 disappearing	 around	 the	 bend	 of	 the	 river. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	they	reach	it	again,	the	police	are	pulling	three	men	and	a	woman	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">boat,	all	handcuffed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looters,”	someone	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wouldn’t	like	to	be	in	their	shoes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	will	happen	to	them,	do	you	think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	cares?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 pass	 Wapping	 and	 progress	 under	 Tower	 Bridge,	 both	 spans	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bascule	up.	Water	laps	high	on	the	walls	of	the	Tower	of	London.	They	continue</p>
<p class="calibre1">under	 London	 Bridge	 and	 Southwark	 Bridge	 and	 just	 scrape	 under	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Millennium	 Bridge.	 They	 watch	 other,	 taller	 boats	 pulling	 to	 the	 side	 and offloading	their	passengers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	water	level	must	be	dropping	at	last,”	the	talkative	passenger	says.	“We</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t	travel	this	far	on	Monday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Victoria	Embankment	is	flooded,	as	are	the	lower	floors	of	all	the	buildings</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 it.	 They	 have	 to	 pull	 in	 before	 Westminster	 Bridge,	 a	 part	 of	 the	 river	 their ferryman	 says	 is	 impassable,	 so	 they	 make	 their	 way	 along	 Northumberland</p>
<p class="calibre1">Avenue,	branch	off	by	Craven	Street	and	stop	next	to	the	Playhouse	Theatre.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">boy	jumps	off	at	the	waterline,	pulls	in	and	steadies	the	boat.	The	ferryman	stops</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	engine	and	puts	down	the	plank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	sees	a	number	of	cars	waiting	at	the	top	of	the	lane	with	their	armed</p>
<p class="calibre1">men,	 broadcasting	 the	 names	 of	 the	 people	 they’re	 waiting	 for,	 type	 hanging</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>above	their	heads.	There	are	a	number	of	real	policemen	amongst	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	passengers	begin	filing	off.	Mathew	walks	slowly	along	the	road	until	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">spots	 a	 floating	 tag	 reading	 “Erlang.”	 The	 guard	 reads	 Mathew’s	 Nexus</p>
<p class="calibre1">information	 but	 still	 wants	 to	 check	 his	 ID	 card,	 examining	 it	 critically	 and scanning	the	chip	before	opening	the	car	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 takes	 a	 while	 for	 the	 road	 to	 clear	 of	 cars.	 Once	 away	 from	 the	 river,	 the familiar	streets	are	relatively	everyday,	except	there	are	far	fewer	pedestrians	and there	 are	 piles	 of	 sandbags	 around	 the	 doorways	 of	 the	 buildings	 nearest	 the waterline. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	Trafalgar	Square	things	are	different.	Whitehall	is	blockaded,	and	there	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">army	vehicles	parked	in	the	street	and	packs	of	soldiers,	some	in	exoskeletons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	are	standing	still,	poised,	but	if	needed	they	are	capable	of	running	twice	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">fast	as	the	fastest	man	and	crushing	human	bones	with	their	robotic	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Surveillance	robots,	black	metal	dogs	without	faces,	patrol	the	area,	sniffing</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	explosives	or	people.	When	they	move	from	one	area	to	the	next,	they	bound</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	an	uncanny	gait. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	glances	above,	noticing	movement.	A	couple	of	drones	fly	over	the	roof</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	National	Gallery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 start	 to	 drive	 along	 Charing	 Cross	 Road	 and	 sit	 for	 a	 while	 in	 traffic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through	the	glass	separating	Mathew	from	the	guard	he	hears	a	sudden	flurry	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">noise.	 The	 guard	 speaks	 to	 the	 on-board	 computer,	 turns,	 pulls	 back	 the	 glass plate,	 and	 says	 to	 Mathew,	 “We’re	 going	 to	 take	 a	 detour.	 Nothing	 to	 worry about.”	This	immediately	makes	Mathew	anxious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 car	 swings	 off	 to	 the	 right.	 They	 head	 along	 St	 Martin’s	 Lane.	 As	 they get	to	Seven	Dials,	Mathew	peers	along	Cranbourn	Street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	are	people	everywhere,	and	many	of	them	are	throwing	things.	A	car	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 fire,	 and	 furniture	 is	 piled	 in	 the	 road,	 also	 alight.	 An	 armoured	 police	 van drives	into	the	pile	of	burning	furniture,	sending	it	flying,	knocking	people	aside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	the	sound	of	gunfire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew’s	 car	 turns	 sharply	 onto	 Garrick	 Street	 away	 from	 the	 disturbance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 they	 drive	 away,	 he	 hears	 an	 explosion.	 They	 drive	 along	 Floral	 Street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Covent	 Garden	 is	 deserted.	 The	 guard	 turns	 back	 to	 Mathew,	 grinning,	 “Told you.	Safe	as	houses.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five	 minutes	 later,	 they	 park	 in	 front	 of	 Mathew’s	 school.	 He	 walks	 up	 the steps,	shaky	and	unnerved.	There	are	guards	here	too,	checking	people’s	ID.	As</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	move	through	the	doors,	he	joins	the	line,	thinking	he’d	never	expected	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	grateful	to	come	into	this	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">10	Robot	Building</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 are	 sitting	 in	 a	 windowless	 room	 facing	 a	 large	 Canvas	 screen.	 When the	 students	 are	 all	 assembled,	 a	 video	 starts	 to	 play,	 providing	 their	 challenge instructions.	 Some	 people	 start	 to	 write	 notes	 on	 their	 personal	 Paper	 devices, their	 super-thin	 portable	 computer	 interfaces.	 Mathew	 doesn’t	 bother.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">switches	off	his	dragons	in	order	to	concentrate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	challenge	is	to	build	any	kind	of	robot,	but	extra	points	will	be	awarded</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	group	for	originality	and	planning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 knows	 the	 room	 is	 well	 scattered	 with	 cameras	 and	 that	 the	 real</p>
<p class="calibre1">purpose	 of	 the	 exercise	 is	 to	 test	 how	 each	 individual	 scores	 against	 the academy’s	 latest	 template	 for	 leadership	 and	 teamwork.	 The	 criteria	 change</p>
<p class="calibre1">depending	 on	 the	 academic	 staff	 involved.	 It’s	 impossible	 to	 discover	 who	 is setting	and	assessing	the	test,	so	it’s	impossible	to	game	the	system. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	hates	these	exercises. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 scans	 the	 room	 and	 recognises	 all	 of	 the	 fifteen	 assembled,	 including</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alison	 Gai	 and	 Kaleb	 Merryfield,	 his	 physics	 partner,	 but	 his	 heart	 sinks	 when he	spots	Theo	Arkam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 realises	 his	 arms	 are	 folded	 across	 his	 chest,	 and	 this	 appears	 defensive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arkam	 is	 contemplating	 him	 with	 a	 slight	 smile	 and	 an	 ironic	 twinkle.	 He	 is sitting	back	in	his	chair	with	his	arms	behind	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great	way	to	start,	Erling,”	he	says.	“Awesome	body	language.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	Erlang,	as	you	know.	And	likewise,”	Mathew	says,	nodding	at	Arkam’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">posture.	“Not	to	mention	awesome	interpersonal	skills.”	But	he	isn’t	as	cocky	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	sounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 so	 sorry	 for	 getting	 your	 name	 wrong,”	 Arkam	 says.	 His	 voice	 sounds genuinely	contrite,	but	there’s	a	hard	glint	in	his	eyes.	“I	was	almost	right.”	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly	turns	to	the	rest	of	the	room.	“Right,	team,	shall	we	get	started?	Is	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">alright	with	you,	Mathew?	Are	you	ready?	There	are	fifteen	of	us.	Shall	we	split</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	five	teams	of	three	and	brainstorm	high-level	ideas	for	fifteen	minutes?	We</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	each	come	back	with	a	pitch	and	vote	in	a	ballot	on	the	best	one?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	 there	 some	 instructions	 I	 missed	 appointing	 you	 leader,	 or	 did	 you</p>
<p class="calibre1">appoint	yourself?”	Mathew	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	a	suggestion	in	the	absence	of	any	alternatives.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	wasn’t	a	chance	for	anyone	to	offer	any	alternatives,	was	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	right,	Arkam,”	Alison	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>“You	want	to	debate	how	to	run	the	session?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	it	would	be	in	the	spirit	of	the	exercise,”	Alison	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.	How	do	you	want	to	run	the	session,	Erling?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Erlang.	 It	 shouldn’t	 be	 a	 debate	 between	 you	 and	 me.	 Why	 don’t	 you	 ask some	of	the	other	people	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arkam	glares	at	Mathew,	but	he	says	to	the	room,	“Suggestions?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kaleb	 says,	 “Why	 don’t	 we	 brainstorm	 high-level	 ideas	 all	 together	 first? </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	way	we’ll	use	the	big	group	to	bounce	ideas	off	each	other.	Then	we	build	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">shortlist	 of	 the	 best	 five	 and	 afterwards	 we	 split	 into	 teams	 to	 build	 high-level proposals	we	pitch	to	each	other.	We	vote	for	the	best,	and	then	we	make	a	plan, </p>
<p class="calibre1">divide	the	work,	and	split	into	teams	to	complete.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sounds	complicated.	Any	other	suggestions?”	Arkam	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	are	no	other	suggestions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	sure	what	the	point	of	this	was,”	Arkam	says	testily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 says	 to	 those	 around	 the	 table,	 “Simple	 show	 of	 hands.	 Those	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Arkam’s	approach?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five	 hands	 tentatively	 rise,	 including	 Arkam’s	 and	 that	 of	 his	 best	 friend, Oliver	Thyer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Those	for	Merryfield’s?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ten	hands	go	up,	including	Mathew’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Merryfield’s	method	has	it,	I	think.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 is	 stupid,”	 Arkam	 says.	 “My	 idea	 was	 clearly	 better.	 You	 just	 voted against	it	because	you	like	Merryfield	better.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	for	real?”	Alison	asks	Arkam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	catches	Alison’s	eye	and,	trying	not	to	smile,	turns	to	ask	Merryfield, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	want	to	run	the	brainstorming	session?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	.	.	.”	Merryfield	is	flustered.	“Okay.	.	.	.”	He	stands	awkwardly	and	walks</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	front	of	the	Canvas,	grabbing	the	digital	pen	in	the	clip	at	the	side.	He	swipes</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 get	 a	 clean	 whiteboard.	 “I	 think	 we	 should	 start	 by	 listing	 any	 and	 all thoughts.	 There	 are	 no	 silly	 ideas.	 I’ll	 write	 them	 down.	 What	 kind	 of	 robot could	we	build?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cyborg,”	Alison	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great,”	Arkam	sneers.	“How	appropriate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thyer	guffaws. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	are	no	stupid	ideas,”	Merryfield	says,	scribbling	“Cyborg.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some	of	us	have	implanted	e-Pins.	We	all	have	medibots,	making	us	forms</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	cyborg.	It’s	not	impossible,”	Alison	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 agree,	 Alison,”	 Arkam	 says,	 straight-faced.	 “There’s	 a	 lot	 of	 evidence	 of cyborgs,	even	in	this	room.”	He	glares	at	Thyer.	“Oli,	stop	sniggering,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>“Gai	made	a	good	point.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exoskeleton?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great	idea,”	Merryfield	says,	capturing	it.	“There	are	different	variants.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	paraplegics.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	soldiers	and	policemen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	VR	games.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Base	jumping.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Merryfield	scribbles	them	all	down.	“What	else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Helperbots.	HomeAngels,	carers	for	the	sick.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Guide	dogs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sniffer	dogs.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Space	walkers	to	fix	broken	parts	on	space	stations.	Mars	and	moon	rovers</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	identify	Helium	3	deposits.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exoplanet	explorers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 says,	 “There’s	 small	 stuff.	 Insectibots.	 Pollinators.	 Beebots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Spybots.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cyborg	spy	rats.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or	mice.	They’re	smaller.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Animated	morphing	intelligent	goop	that	moves	between	gaps	in	walls.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cool.	I	like	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	do	I.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	getting	stupider	by	the	minute,”	Arkam	says.	“How	are	we	going	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	‘goop’?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kitchen	 cleaners	 are	 intelligent	 goop	 –	 they	 can’t	 be	 hard	 to	 make.	 Our medibots	 are	 built	 with	 intelligent	 viruses,	 right?	 There’s	 nothing	 in	 the	 scope here	 concerning	 sticking	 to	 machine	 parts.	 Why	 should	 we	 stick	 to	 things	 we have	all	done	before?”	Mathew	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	we’re	good	at	them,”	says	Arkam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	what	will	we	learn?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	think	you’re	here	to	learn?”	Arkam	is	smiling	at	Mathew.	He	shakes	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">head.	“I	thought	you	were	supposed	to	be	smart.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Merryfield	says,	“At	this	stage	we	should	pool	all	our	ideas	and	not	discuss</p>
<p class="calibre1">how	we’re	going	to	do	them.	Anything	else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	haven’t	got	soldierbots.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	what	next?”	Arkam	says.	“We	need	five	ideas.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Merryfield	splits	the	Canvas	screen	so	their	ideas	are	on	the	left	and	there	is	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a>blank	 screen	 on	 the	 right.	 “We	 need	 a	 framework	 to	 narrow	 them.	 Any suggestions?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	long	will	they	take?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Merryfield	writes,	“Time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	we	have	the	materials?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it	possible	to	make	the	materials?	Or	get	them	easily?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	we	have	the	knowledge?”	Arkam	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	easy	would	it	be	to	learn?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it	fun?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it	useful?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Merryfield	 creates	 a	 grid	 reading,	 “Time,	 Materials,	 Knowledge,	 Fun,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Useful”	at	the	top.	He	draws	lines	down	and	across.	The	computer	immediately</p>
<p class="calibre1">interprets	what	he	wants	to	do	and	creates	a	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	go	through	the	list,	shall	we?	Let’s	score	them.	One	is	most	positive, </p>
<p class="calibre1">five	is	most	negative.	Lowest	score	wins.	How	feasible	is	an	exoskeleton?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	would	probably	take	us	a	while,	because	it’s	fairly	complex.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 depends	 on	 how	 ambitious	 we	 are.	 I	 think	 it’s	 not	 beyond	 us	 to	 build something	 supporting	 muscle	 power	 in	 legs,	 for	 instance.	 It	 also	 scores	 pretty high	on	usefulness.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shall	we	list	the	different	types	of	exoskeleton	for	scoring?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	only	got	today,	you	know,”	Arkam	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 right,	 Arkam,”	 Merryfield	 says.	 “Let’s	 limit	 this	 session	 to	 half	 an hour.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	 this	 session	 is	 half	 an	 hour,	 how	 long	 is	 the	 next	 stage?	 And	 the	 one after?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Merryfield	gapes	mutely	at	Arkam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arkam	 turns	 to	 Mathew.	 “You’re	 quiet,	 Erling.	 Have	 you	 left	 us	 for	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">duration?”	 Mathew	 is	 doing	 something	 on	 his	 Paper.	 “Are	 you	 able	 to	 spare some	time	to	join	us	and	offer	some	time-management	tips?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 says,	 “Just	 a	 moment.”	 He	 finishes	 something	 and	 then	 smiles	 at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Arkam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arkam	is	watching	him.	Mathew	points	to	the	Canvas	screen.	“Accept,	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">you,	Merryfield?”	Mathew	says	as	a	dialog	box	pops	up	with	a	message	saying, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	friend	is	trying	to	share	your	screen.	Accept.	Deny.”	Mathew	says,	“Move	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">new	window	to	the	left	where	you	have	the	score	chart.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	 made	 a	 neater	 version	 of	 Merryfield’s	 chart.	 Well	 done!”	 Arkam</p>
<p class="calibre1">says	with	sarcastic	enthusiasm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look	 at	 your	 Papers.	 I’ve	 sent	 you	 a	 voting	 app.	 It	 contains	 all	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Merryfield’s	options.	You	have	to	go	through	line	by	line	and	score	each	option. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>The	 average	 accumulated	 scores	 will	 appear	 on	 the	 Canvas	 as	 you	 vote.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	turns	to	Arkam.	“Quicker	and	more	democratic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arkam	 snorts,	 but	 he	 unscrolls	 his	 Paper	 and	 opens	 the	 app.	 The	 voting	 is done	in	a	few	minutes.	They	have	five	candidates.	The	lower	body	exoskeleton</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 paraplegics,	 the	 guide	 dog,	 the	 spybot,	 the	 moon	 rover,	 and	 the	 military drone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	 what,	 Mr	 Organiser?”	 Arkam	 says.	 “Shall	 we	 split	 into	 teams	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">discuss?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Merryfield	either	doesn’t	detect	the	sarcasm	or	chooses	to	ignore	it.	Mathew</p>
<p class="calibre1">decides	Merryfield	is	a	better	person	than	he	is.	“Yes.	Great	idea,	Arkam.	Let’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">split	into	five	teams	of	three,	based	on	where	we’re	sitting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	like	to	do	the	spybot,”	Mathew	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does	that	work	for	you?	Are	you	happy	to	work	with	Erlang?”	Arkam	asks</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	two	people	sitting	next	to	Mathew.	They	nod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	 the	 moon	 rover,”	 Alison	 says	 after	 a	 whispered	 conference	 with	 the two	nearest	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	we’re	staking	claims,	we’re	the	military	drone,”	Arkam	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jane	 Wilson,	 who	 is	 sitting	 next	 to	 Arkam,	 says,	 “I	 want	 to	 work	 on	 the exoskeleton.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	swap	with	you,”	Oliver	Thyer	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Guide	dog,”	another	student	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,”	says	Merryfield.	“Half	an	hour	from	now,	we	report.	You	need	high-</p>
<p class="calibre1">level	designs,	plans	for	execution,	and	a	pitch.	We’ll	meet,	hear	the	pitches,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">vote	anonymously,	Mathew,	if	you	don’t	mind	creating	another	voting	app?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	at	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 winning	 team	 will	 lead	 the	 project	 and	 allocate	 work.	 We	 break	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">lunch	at	12:30.	We’ll	spend	the	afternoon	building	the	robot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	split	into	their	teams	and	scatter	around	the	room,	taking	their	chairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 is	 with	 Wyatt	 Yerby	 and	 Lydia	 Dowd.	 He	 gets	 an	 extra	 chair	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">snaps	his	Paper	to	the	back	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Any	ideas?”	Wyatt	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	base	our	spybot	on	a	pre-existing	model.	We’ll	download	plans	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nexus	and	adapt	them.	It	will	save	a	lot	of	time,”	Mathew	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shouldn’t	we	be	worried	we	might	plagiarise	something?”	Lydia	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“None	of	these	ideas	are	particularly	original.	What	do	they	expect	us	to	do	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	day?”	Wyatt	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	both	look	at	Mathew,	who	says,	“I	think	you’re	both	right.	We	need	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">offer	an	original	spin	on	an	existing	idea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a>“Fantastic.	But	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	if	we	use	something	not	meant	to	spy	for	spying?”	Mathew	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	what?”	Wyatt	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	small	robot	is	used	for	practical	purposes?”	says	Lydia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Medibots?”	Wyatt	suggests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	love	the	idea,	but	we’ll	probably	not	get	it	past	the	practicality	committee,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lydia	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	says,	“There’s	beebots.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Erm	.	.	.”	Wyatt	frowns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 persists,	 “Crop	 pollinators.	 What	 farmers	 use	 these	 days	 instead	 of bees.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay	.	.	.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	 small	 enough	 to	 squeeze	 through	 keyholes	 and	 walk	 under	 doors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 are	 also	 thousands	 of	 free	 templates	 on	 the	 Nexus.	 We	 download	 one	 of these	and	use	plans	for	a	more	conventional	spybot	to	add	recording	capabilities</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	beebot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	very	simple,”	Lydia	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	that’s	a	problem	because	.	.	.	?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seven	 votes	 for	 the	 drone.	 Ha!”	 Arkam	 says,	 his	 eyes	 shining	 in	 triumph, gazing	directly	at	Mathew	as	he	speaks.	“Seven	votes	wins	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 morning	 Arkam	 has	 been	 the	 head	 of	 the	 practicality	 committee.	 When</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	questions	the	feasibility	of	building	a	drone	plane	with	operational	arms</p>
<p class="calibre1">able	to	grasp	and	lift	in	one	afternoon,	everyone	believes	Arkam	when	he	says, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	would	not	champion	an	idea	I	don’t	believe	would	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	knows	this	is	a	lie.	Arkam	simply	doesn’t	want	the	afternoon	going</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 way	 of	 the	 morning,	 with	 other	 people	 taking	 control.	 With	 his	 idea selected,	 it	 means	 he	 will	 spend	 the	 afternoon	 telling	 others	 what	 to	 do	 with perfect	legitimacy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	you	work	on	the	arms?”	Arkam	says	to	Mathew,	as	he	allocates</p>
<p class="calibre1">work	after	lunch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	 no	 idea	 how	 to	 build	 arms	 on	 a	 perfectly	 aerodynamic	 object	 without ruining	the	aerodynamics.	The	arms	will	destabilise	the	front	of	the	plane.	I	told</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	so	earlier	when	I	said	this	project	won’t	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	 negative!”	 Arkam	 says.	 “We	 need	 total	 commitment	 here.	 We	 need	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">work	together.	I	don’t	want	you	poisoning	the	atmosphere	and	demoralising	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rest	of	the	team.	Buck	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	are	asked	to	leave	at	5:30.	School	security	comes	to	tell	them	a	fleet	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>Aegis	cars	is	waiting	to	take	them	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	hasn’t	managed	to	make	aerodynamic	arms	for	the	drone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	hope	they	grade	us	on	our	teamwork	and	leadership	skills,	rather	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">productivity,	 hey,	 Erling?”	 Arkam	 says,	 catching	 Mathew	 as	 he	 takes	 the	 stairs towards	 the	 exit.	 He	 puts	 his	 hand	 on	 Mathew’s	 arm,	 stops	 him,	 and	 turns	 him slightly,	bending	his	head	to	look	him	in	the	eye.	“I	thought	as	much,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	are	your	eyes	blue,	Erling?	You’re	not	Caucasian.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	shakes	him	off,	saying.	“They	aren’t.	My	Lenzes	are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	 you	 still	 wearing	 Lenzes?	 I’ve	 moved	 on	 to	 X-eyte	 Wear.	 The	 natural look	 is	 more	 in	 now,	 you	 know.	 Changing	 your	 eye	 colour	 is	 a	 bit	 suspect.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	doesn’t	say	anything.	It	takes	a	moment,	and	then	it	clicks	for	Arkam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	weren’t	bought	for	you,	were	they?	They	belonged	to	your	dad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	sighs.	“What	do	you	care?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Touchy.	Very	touchy.	 Your	father	was	 Soren	Erlang,	wasn’t	 he?	The	Soren</p>
<p class="calibre1">Erlang.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?	And	what	do	you	mean,	the	Soren	Erlang?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arkam	shrugs.	“No	reason.	Just	curious.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look	it	up,	Erling.	Look	it	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look	it	up	where?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 Arkam	 doesn’t	 respond.	 Mathew	 watches	 him	 skip	 down	 the	 last	 few</p>
<p class="calibre1">steps	and	across	the	lobby. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Bastard</i>,	he	thinks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 journey	 in	 the	 car	 to	 the	 river	 is	 punctuated	 by	 blocked	 roads	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">detours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	 throws	 a	 bottle	 at	 the	 car	 as	 they	 drive	 through	 Covent	 Garden.	 It makes	a	surprisingly	violent	noise.	The	guard	swears	loudly,	but	the	car	doesn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">slow.	It	keeps	on	driving,	accelerating	away	from	the	trouble.	The	guard	cranes</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	neck	around,	identifies	the	perpetrator,	someone	in	the	faceless	mass	behind	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">police	barricade.	It	will	all	be	on	dronevision	anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 car	 drops	 Mathew	 by	 the	 Playhouse	 Theatre.	 The	 same	 people	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">travelled	 with	 in	 the	 morning	 are	 standing	 waiting.	 There’s	 the	 same	 boat,	 the same	 ferryman,	 the	 same	 guard	 at	 the	 back,	 and	 the	 same	 boy	 wading	 in	 the filthy	river	to	bring	the	boat	in	to	shore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 boat	 trip	 is	 slightly	 less	 unnerving	 the	 second	 time	 around.	 Mathew</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinks	 it	 is	 possible	 to	 get	 used	 to	 anything.	 The	 people	 on	 the	 rooftops,	 their fires,	 and	 their	 makeshift	 shelters	 aren’t	 a	 surprise.	 The	 front-row	 view	 of	 the drowning	ancient	city	isn’t	so	shocking. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>The	 car	 and	 his	 guard	 from	 the	 morning	 are	 waiting	 for	 him	 at	 Greenwich. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sitting	in	its	roomy	back,	Mathew	sends	an	ETA	to	Leibniz	as	they	crawl	slowly</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	the	hill,	past	the	stuff	hung	to	dry	and	the	people	in	their	tents	and	shacks	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	common. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	turns	the	dragons	back	on	for	light	relief.	They	are	bewildered.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">last	thing	they	remember	is	being	in	the	school	lobby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	dragons	play	around	him,	Mathew	rolls	out	his	Paper	and	displays	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">beebot	design	he’d	worked	on	in	class.	He	rotates	it	with	his	finger	and	makes</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 small	 adjustments.	 He	 thinks	 about	 Mr	 Lestrange,	 his	 lack	 of	 Nexus</p>
<p class="calibre1">records,	the	meek	way	Clara’s	psychotic	guard	retreated,	the	acoustic	amplifier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 thinks	 about	 Clara	 and	 her	 parents	 and	 her	 fear	 and	 anger	 over	 being watched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Closing	his	eyes	for	a	moment,	he	sees	Mr	Lestrange	once	again	through	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">window	 of	 the	 upstairs	 bay	 window	 in	 Pickervance	 Road.	 Why	 is	 he	 watching her?	 Something	 tells	 him	 that	 if	 he	 can	 find	 a	 way	 into	 Mr	 Lestrange’s	 house, he’ll	find	the	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	meal	is	waiting	in	the	kitchen	when	he	gets	home.	Leibniz	has	set	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	sits	as	a	plate	of	food	and	a	drink	are	put	in	front	of	him.	O’Malley	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">rubbing	 around	 his	 legs,	 mewing	 loudly,	 wanting	 attention	 after	 being	 home alone	all	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grasping	his	knife	and	fork,	Mathew	says,	“Thank	you,	Leibniz.	I	appreciate</p>
<p class="calibre1">it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	welcome,	Mathew.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 knows	 he	 is	 talking	 to	 a	 complex	 computer	 program	 and	 not	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">person,	but	it	seems	rude	not	to	thank	Leibniz.	“I	made	robots	today,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	a	robot,	Mathew,”	Leibniz	replies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	thoughtfully	scrutinises	his	machine.	He	says,	“I	know	you	are.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	does	it	feel	like	to	be	a	robot?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Leibniz	just	blinks.	The	light	on	its	chest	panel	indicates	thought	cycles</p>
<p class="calibre1">quickly,	in	the	way	it	does	when	it’s	crashing,	and	then	turns	red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 sighs,	 “Cancel	 conversation.”	 When	 that	 doesn’t	 work,	 he	 says, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Reboot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leibniz’s	lights	go	off.	When	it	starts	again,	it	immediately	goes	off	to	clean</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	dishes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 the	 Canvas,	 there’s	 a	 report	 of	 a	 suspected	 terrorist	 attack	 on	 crops	 in Texas	 by	 Mexican	 separatists.	 They	 have	 destroyed	 hundreds	 of	 thousands	 of acres	of	specially	designed	drought-tolerant	crops	aimed	at	easing	the	latest	food</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>crisis	in	the	southern	US. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	governor	of	Texas	is	interviewed.	He	says,	“This	is	a	particularly	cynical</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 evil	 act,	 given	 the	 humanitarian	 crisis	 we	 have	 here	 right	 now.	 But	 those responsible	should	know	we	will	not	be	intimidated	and	will	stand	against	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">using	any	means	necessary.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amongst	 those	 interviewed	 in	 the	 report	 is	 Minister	 Eben	 O'Hingerty, </p>
<p class="calibre1">founder	 of	 the	 Edenist	 movement,	 whose	 activists	 were	 first	 thought	 to	 be responsible	for	the	sabotage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">O'Hingerty	says,	“We	are	against	these	genetically	modified	crops.	They	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	 abomination	 in	 the	 sight	 of	 the	 Lord.	 They	 are	 an	 example	 of	 the	 extreme arrogance	 of	 today’s	 scientists	 wanting	 to	 play	 God,	 when	 they	 know	 no	 more than	children.	We	believe	these	kinds	of	monstrous	experiments	with	nature	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 dire	 consequences	 for	 all	 of	 humankind.	 At	 this	 time	 in	 human	 history, when	nature	is	teaching	us	all	what	happens	when	men	interfere	with	laws	laid</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	by	God,	we	should	know	better.	But	the	Edenist	movement	operates	within</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	law	and	the	democratic	process.	We	condemn	this	sabotage	as	a	terrorist	act</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 are	 at	 one	 with	 the	 government	 in	 standing	 against	 these	 separatists.	 We offer	our	full	support	to	the	police	in	hunting	down	the	culprits.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	is	imagining	what	his	grandmother	will	say	when	she	sees	the	BBC</p>
<p class="calibre1">showing	an	interview	with	the	leader	of	the	Edenist	movement	whilst	boycotting</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	leader	of	the	Garden	Party.	He	makes	a	mental	note	to	ask	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 his	 mother	 comes	 home,	 they	 sit	 in	 silence	 in	 the	 kitchen.	 When	 she asks	him	what	he’s	done	all	day,	he	starts	to	tell	her	about	his	trip	to	town	and	his robotics	 class.	 Normally,	 she	 would	 quiz	 him,	 but	 she	 just	 nods,	 gazing	 at	 her food,	prodding	at	it	with	her	fork. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mum,	can	I	ask	you	something,	or	are	you	too	tired	to	talk?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 straightens	 herself,	 guilty.	 “No.	 Of	 course	 not.	 You	 can	 ask	 me</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	did	Grandma	get	to	Elgol?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	mother	raises	an	eyebrow.	“Being	at	home	alone	is	giving	you	too	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	to	think.	But	if	you	really	want	to	know,	she	was	invited	to	join	when	she</p>

<p class="calibre1">“She	lived	with	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 when	 she	 first	 came	 to	 England,	 she	 lived	 here	 for	 eighteen	 months. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don’t	you	remember?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shakes	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	were	little,	I	suppose.	She	was	told	there	was	a	plot	available	at	Elgol</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>“She	was	in	the	Garden	Party?” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“You	did?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Things	have	changed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	changed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	not	Grandma?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	 was	 always	 a	 bit	 stronger	 in	 her	 views	 than	 me.	 But	 you	 have	 to</p>

<p class="calibre1">“What	did	she	go	through	in	China?” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“My	car	drove	across	the	common	this	morning.	That’s	pretty	awful.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	it	is.	But	it	could	be	much	worse.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 struggles	 to	 imagine	 how.	 He	 says,	 “Don’t	 you	 worry,	 with	 her	 so	 far away?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course.	But	to	be	honest,	I	think	she’s	safer	there	than	we	are	here.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">Mathew	is	dreaming	of	his	father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	are	on	holiday	in	Elgol,	at	the	beach.	It	is	one	of	those	endless	summer</p>
<p class="calibre1">days.	The	heat	shimmers	over	the	sand.	In	the	dream,	he	is	grown,	older	than	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 now,	 but	 his	 father	 and	 mother	 are	 young.	 The	 three	 of	 them	 are	 standing waist-deep	in	water,	throwing	a	ball	around	in	a	circle.	His	mother	is	laughing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">splashing	water	at	his	father.	Mathew	is	happy.	His	grandmother	is	sitting	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">beach	 with	 his	 Japanese	 grandfather,	 who’s	 wearing	 sunglasses	 and	 a	 business suit	and	is	reading	a	paper	book,	even	though	he	is	dead	and	Mathew	has	never</p>
<p class="calibre1">met	 him.	 His	 Danish	 grandparents	 are	 walking	 away	 along	 the	 water’s	 edge; their	backs	retreat	and	blur	with	the	heat	haze	on	the	horizon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	is	someone	else	there	too,	not	in	sight,	a	stranger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	and	play	ball,”	Mathew’s	father	says	to	the	stranger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 familiar,	 disembodied	 voice	 says,	 “Carry	 on.	 I’ll	 watch.	 Don’t	 let	 me disturb	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	is	a	strange,	distracting	noise	that	doesn’t	belong.	It’s	trying	to	pull	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">away,	but	he	doesn’t	want	to	leave	the	dream	because	he	wants	to	stay	with	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">dad.	He	wants	to	ignore	the	noise,	wants	it	to	go	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Awake	suddenly,	eyes	open,	he	hears	it	clearly.	It	says,	“Mathew!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	 his	 mother	 outside	 his	 door.	 Not	 her	 normal	 morning	 voice.	 She	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">stressed,	worried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	is	wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	climbs	carefully	over	O’Malley,	asleep	next	to	him,	clambers	free	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bed,	his	foot	catching	in	a	sheet.	He	stumbles	over	to	the	door	and	opens	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	it?	What’s	happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	mother	is	pale,	shocked,	disbelieving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have	you	heard	the	news?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	I	was	asleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	and	see,”	she	says,	and	she	leaves	him	to	follow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	is	close	behind	her	all	the	way	to	the	kitchen.	She	sits	on	a	chair,	her	eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	Canvas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 prime	 minister	 is	 being	 interviewed.	 Text	 is	 cycling	 fast	 across	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bottom	 of	 the	 screen.	 “US	 Battlestars	 destroyed.	 Hypersonic	 aircraft	 attack	 US</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	allied	military	bases	worldwide.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	prime	minister	is	standing	on	the	steps	of	10	Downing	Street,	surrounded</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>by	 reporters.	 He’s	 saying,	 “I	 have	 spoken	 to	 the	 president	 of	 the	 United	 States and	the	leaders	of	NATO	and	can	confirm	that	at	2200	hours	GMT	last	night	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">NATO	 Battlestars	 Heracles,	 Pallas,	 and	 Polemos	 were	 destroyed	 by	 enemy</p>
<p class="calibre1">missiles.	The	Battlestars	were	in	the	process	of	being	evacuated	when	they	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">hit.	Ninety-seven	crew	are	unaccounted	for	at	this	time.	The	Japanese	moon	base</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	space	station	were	active	in	assisting	the	survivors.	In	addition,	the	RAF	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">USAF	have	told	me	that	hypersonic	craft	have	attacked	bases	on	British	soil	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lakenheath,	 Mildenhall,	 Croughton,	 Molesworth,	 Welford,	 Menwith	 Hill, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fairford,	 and	 Alconbury.	 Similar	 attacks	 were	 reported	 at	 bases	 in	 Belgium, Cyprus,	Germany,	Portugal,	Norway,	Spain,	Italy,	Turkey,	Poland,	India,	Korea, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	Japan.	This	is	an	entirely	unprovoked	attack	against	the	US,	Britain,	and	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">allies.	It	is	with	a	profoundly	heavy	heart	that	I	have	to	tell	you,	as	of	last	night we	are	at	war	with	China	and	Russia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	mother	stands	and	walks	away	from	the	Canvas	to	take	a	call. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course,”	she	says.	“I	understand.	Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	hangs	up	and	studies	Mathew’s	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	says,	“They	want	you	in	at	work?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	Will	you	be	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	leave	the	house.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wasn’t	planning	to	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	call	to	check	on	you	later.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	be	fine.	Don’t	worry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 his	 mother	 has	 left,	 he	 calls	 his	 grandmother.	 She	 sounds	 relieved	 to hear	from	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mathew!	I	was	going	to	call.	Are	you	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	we	are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	worried	sick.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	attacked	military	bases.	Not	towns.	Not	cities.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	now.	But	god	knows	what	will	happen	next.	If	things	escalate,	London</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	a	short	flight	from	Moscow.	Is	your	mother	there?	I’d	like	to	speak	to	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	she	went	into	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	company	of	hers	has	no	conscience.	They’ll	have	her	working	overtime</p>
<p class="calibre1">now.	 Listen,	 Mathew,	 you	 should	 come	 and	 stay	 with	 me	 until	 this	 situation ends.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	won’t	leave	Mum.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	would	probably	help	her	to	know	you	will	be	safe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>“No.	I’m	sorry.	I	can’t	leave	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hopefully	this	will	be	sorted	quickly.	I	heard	the	German	prime	minister	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">chairing	 talks	 between	 the	 US	 and	 China	 today.	 I	 think	 the	 US	 is	 probably bluffing	the	negotiations	to	buy	some	time	while	they	plan	a	counterattack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	says,	“Cadmus	Silverwood	warned	this	would	happen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	he	did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 pauses	 and	 then	 says,	 “You	 know,	 you	 mentioned	 your	 friend	 who</p>
<p class="calibre1">helped	set	the	alternative	service	up	for	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only	in	passing.	Not	specifically.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh.	Good.	I	worry	what	I	do	and	don’t	say	sometimes.	It’s	my	age,	I	think. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or	maybe	I’ve	always	been	this	way.	What	do	you	want	with	my	friend?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	think	he	would	help	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	kind	of	help?	You	said	everything	is	fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	just	something	I’d	like	to	research.	It’s	a	bit	unorthodox.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing	serious,	though,	Mat?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing	that	will	get	you	into	trouble?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	he	says	definitely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	I	am	worried.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sighs.	“I’ll	find	out	if	my	friend	is	available	for	a	chat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,	Grandma.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	not	going	to	get	me	in	trouble	with	your	mother,	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.	I	don’t	want	to	give	her	any	excuse	to	make	it	difficult	for	me	to	talk</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	too	busy	to	notice,	anyhow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 sure	 that’s	 not	 true.	 I’ve	 got	 to	 go.	 The	 milkman	 is	 here	 wanting	 his barter	veg.	He	has	wonderful	cream.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	laughs,	“Okay.	Speak	soon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	is	glued	to	the	Canvas,	watching	the	war	coverage	on	the	news,	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">O’Malley	 sitting	 in	 his	 lap.	 There	 is	 little	 new	 information	 and	 mostly</p>
<p class="calibre1">commentary.	He	is	considering	going	to	find	out	what	people	are	saying	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Blackweb	and	Psychopomp	when	Leibniz	appears	in	front	of	him	holding	a	tray</p>
<p class="calibre1">containing	an	elaborate	non-alcoholic	cocktail,	including	a	pineapple	chunk	on	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cocktail	stick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	an	appointment	now,	Mathew.	Your	supervisory	meeting	with	Nan</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>Absolem.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	totally	forgotten!	Is	it	in	the	Darkroom?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	Mathew.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	meets	Nan	Absolem	on	a	beach.	She	is	lying	on	a	deck	chair,	dressed	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sarong,	wearing	sunglasses	and	a	sunhat.	Waves	crash	into	the	shore	behind	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t	 this	 nice?	 Some	 might	 consider	 it	 a	 little	 self-indulgent	 under	 the circumstances,	but	I	think	we	must	raise	our	spirits	in	difficult	times,”	she	says, </p>
<p class="calibre1">smiling	broadly.	“You	seem	a	little	tense.	Is	it	the	news?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	It’s	not	the	news,”	Mathew	says,	although,	in	fact,	he	is	unnerved	by	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	it	then?	The	collaboration	session	yesterday?	You	needn’t	worry.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t	that	bad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	were	doing	well	in	the	morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Until	I	pitched	the	beebot.	Yes,	I	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	least	you	know.	Do	you	want	to	talk	through	what	went	wrong?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	it’s	okay.	I	met	with	Eva	Aslanova.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	My	Russian	colleague	told	me.	And?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	we’d	work	well	together.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	do	we.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have	 you	 spoken	 to	 anyone	 at	 the	 school	 about	 me	 using	 the	 Yinglong</p>
<p class="calibre1">project	towards	my	collaborative	credits	if	I	work	with	Eva?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mathew,	it	might	be	difficult	now,	given	the	political	situation,”	Nan	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course.	I	didn’t	think.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don’t	 know	 what	 the	 school	 and	 the	 education	 board	 will	 say.	 I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">assuming	the	situation	with	Russia	means	there	will	be	restrictions.	I	need	to	ask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	hope	you’ll	continue	to	work	together.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	do	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	there	anything	wrong?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 says,	 “No,	 I’m	 absolutely	 fine.	 Although	 the	 journey	 to	 school	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">unnerving.”	This	at	least	was	true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	not	the	only	one	to	say	so.	We	were	discussing	whether	to	continue</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	collaborative	module	via	the	holovision	for	the	time	being.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	would	be	better.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	it	might	be	sensible.	Now	shall	we	talk	through	your	study	plan?	How’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	AI	module	going?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	is	grateful	for	the	strict	timetable	his	learning	schedule	keeps	him	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 needs	 to	 complete	 a	 certain	 number	 of	 elective	 courses	 a	 day	 to	 keep	 on track.	Inspired	by	the	robot	project,	he	completes	a	course	on	the	use	of	bacteria</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>to	build	circuits,	challenging	enough	for	him	to	block	Mr	Lestrange,	his	father, and	the	war	from	his	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	four	o’clock	he	is	at	the	window	watching	Clara	slide	out	of	the	back	seat</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 her	 car.	 She	 gazes	 at	 his	 window,	 spots	 him,	 smiles	 and	 raises	 her	 hand.	 He raises	his	own	hand	in	response	and	smiles	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,	Mathew,”	she	messages	publicly	for	the	benefit	of	the	guard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,”	Mathew	returns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guard	shakes	his	head,	getting	back	into	the	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	steps	onto	the	pavement	and	says,	“Where	were	you	yesterday?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	had	to	go	in	to	school.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	sucks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	Did	you	miss	me?”	He	can	hardly	believe	what	he’s	saying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	watches	her	smile,	but	she	says,	“Are	you	okay	for	me	to	come	over,	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	discussed?	Can	I	come	after	my	lesson?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	come,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clara	disappears	from	view	below	the	window	frame.	He	hears	the	doorbell</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	then	the	door	slam. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 refocuses	 on	 the	 house	 next	 door,	 fully	 expecting	 to	 come	 face	 to face	 with	 Mr	 Lestrange.	 He	 is	 surprised	 and	 strangely	 disappointed	 when	 he doesn’t.	 He	 adjusts	 the	 zoom	 on	 his	 Lenz	 to	 “tele.”	 But	 Mr	 Lestrange	 is	 not there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he’s	 searching	 for	 his	 neighbour,	 the	 acoustic	 amplifier	 automatically</p>
<p class="calibre1">switches	 on,	 detecting	 noise	 from	 Gen	 Lacey’s	 house.	 Clara’s	 music	 starts</p>
<p class="calibre1">streaming	 into	 his	 room,	 which	 makes	 him	 think	 of	 her	 on	 the	 stage	 at	 the Wigmore	Hall	and	her	absorption	in	playing,	her	face	transcendent.	He	is	drawn</p>
<p class="calibre1">downstairs	 to	 the	 living	 room,	 where	 he	 knows	 she	 is	 sitting	 only	 a	 few	 feet away	from	him,	on	the	other	side	of	the	wall,	playing	Gen’s	grand	piano. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sitting	on	the	floor,	with	his	back	to	the	wall,	he	closes	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 is	 playing	 something	 gorgeous	 and	 sad	 he	 hasn’t	 heard	 before.	 When</p>
<p class="calibre1">she’s	finished,	she	and	Gen	discuss	adding	it	to	the	programme	of	an	upcoming</p>
<p class="calibre1">concert.	Their	voices	are	so	familiar	and	close.	They	have	nothing	to	do	with	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">school	 or	 his	 family	 or	 anything	 causing	 him	 pain.	 More	 than	 anything	 right now,	he	wants	to	be	back	in	Gen’s	front	room	talking	to	Clara. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 occurs	 to	 him	 just	 before	 she	 arrives	 that	 he	 should	 make	 some	 kind	 of attempt	 to	 clean	 his	 room.	 He	 runs	 upstairs	 and	 frantically	 shoves	 clothes	 into the	washing	basket	and	bits	of	electronics	into	a	drawer,	and	instructs	Leibniz	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">give	 the	 room	 a	 quick	 hoover	 and	 polish.	 The	 doorbell	 rings,	 and	 he	 runs</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>downstairs,	tripping	on	the	top	step	and	nearly	falling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Straightening	himself,	he	takes	a	deep	breath	and	then	walks	more	slowly	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">opens	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Strangely,	 when	 they	 are	 face	 to	 face,	 he’s	 startled	 to	 actually	 see	 her	 there and	 stands	 struck	 dumb	 for	 a	 few	 seconds	 longer	 than	 either	 of	 them	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">comfortable	with. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiles	awkwardly.	“Hi,”	she	says.	“Can	I	come	in?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?	 Oh.	 Yeah.	 Come	 in,”	 he	 stands	 back	 to	 let	 her	 pass	 and	 closes	 the door	behind	her.	“Won’t	your	guard	have	a	meltdown	about	you	coming	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	seemed	fine	about	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	would	have	thought	he’d	be	even	more	paranoid,	now	we’re	at	war.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“God,	the	war!	It	doesn’t	seem	real	to	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me	neither.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	 another	 awkward	 pause.	 They	 are	 staring	 at	 one	 another.	 She	 has</p>
<p class="calibre1">noticed	 his	 blue	 Lenzes,	 he	 realises,	 and	 is	 probably	 thinking	 much	 the	 same thing	that	Arkam	did,	but	perhaps	with	a	little	less	malice.	Her	eyes	are	naturally</p>
<p class="calibre1">blue.	He	knows	he	should	speak	and	thrashes	around	in	his	head	for	something</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	say.	“Do	you	want	a	drink	or	something?”	he	asks	finally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shakes	her	head.	“I	can’t	be	too	long.	The	guard	.	.	.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	right.	Yes.”	He	puts	his	hands	in	his	pockets,	pulls	them	out,	and	wraps</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	round	his	body,	then	realises	this	is	defensive,	and	holds	them	in	front	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	awkwardly.	“Shall	we	go	upstairs?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nods.	He	starts	to	move	and	then	says,	“After	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	where	we’re	going,”	she	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	yeah.	Right,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reaching	his	bedroom	door,	he	quickly	shoos	Leibniz	out	of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	make	him	go,”	Clara	says.	“I’ve	never	seen	a	HomeAngel	before.	I’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	seen	the	commercial	ones.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	not	much	different,”	Mathew	says,	but	he	calls	Leibniz	back	to	meet</p>
<p class="calibre1">Clara. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 must	 be	 cool	 having	 one	 of	 these,”	 she	 says,	 smiling	 as	 Mathew	 tells Leibniz	that	Clara	likes	it,	and	Leibniz	blushes.	It	is	a	corny	basic	programme, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	it	amuses	most	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clara	says,	“We	have	the	bathroom	and	kitchen	cleaners	like	everyone	else, </p>
<p class="calibre1">robot	vacuum	cleaners	and	floor	mops,	and	of	course	a	replicator,	but	we	can’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">afford	a	HomeAngel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hardly	 anyone	 can.	 They’re	 given	 as	 corporate	 perks,	 mainly.	 My	 mum</p>
<p class="calibre1">works	for	Panacea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lucky	you.	I	take	it	your	health	insurance	is	free,	as	well.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>“I	 guess.”	 Mathew	 opens	 the	 door	 to	 his	 bedroom.	 As	 Clara	 follows,	 he’s relieved	to	note	that	Leibniz	has	done	a	good	job	of	cleaning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nice	room,”	Clara	says,	peering	around.	“Very	tidy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	thinks	he	catches	a	mischievous	glint	in	her	eye,	but	she	walks	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 his	 desk	 and	 the	 window	 before	 he	 can	 be	 sure.	 He	 follows	 her	 and	 stares across	at	Lestrange’s	bay	window.	There’s	no	one	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	normally	stands	there,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	did	you	first	notice	him	watching	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Monday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	it	was	just	a	coincidence?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 was	 there	 when	 you	 arrived	 and	 left	 on	 Monday,	 Tuesday,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wednesday.	I	wasn’t	here	yesterday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	not	now.	Was	he	there	when	I	arrived?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	Perhaps	he’s	realised	we	know	he’s	watching.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	sure	he	was	watching	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	 he	 was	 watching	 someone	 else	 on	 the	 street.	 Someone	 who	 isn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">here	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	was	definitely	watching	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	both	scan	the	empty	room	of	the	house	next	door	for	a	few	moments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	says,	“So	I	wanted	to	explain	to	you	about	why	I	was	so	angry	the	other	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 didn’t	 want	 to	 do	 it	 on	 Consort	 for	 obvious	 reasons.	 I	 told	 you	 before,	 my parents	are	being	watched.	I	wasn’t	joking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Watched	by	who?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some	government	agency.	The	Secret	Intelligence	Service,	probably.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	how	do	you	know	they’re	watching	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 been	 going	 on	 for	 the	 last	 three	 years.	 Maybe	 more.	 They	 started	 to notice	about	three	years	ago.	Little	things.	For	instance,	they	were	overcharged</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	car	hire.	There	were	fines	for	late	payments	of	taxes	and	utility	bills.	Salary</p>
<p class="calibre1">payments	 went	 missing.	 We’d	 get	 sudden	 inexplicable	 power	 and	 Nexus</p>
<p class="calibre1">blackouts	at	home.	These	things	didn’t	happen	all	at	once,	but	in	a	steady	trickle, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 they	 were	 always	 sorted.	 The	 money	 was	 always	 refunded.	 Errors	 always corrected.	There	were	always	apologies.	But	it	required	lots	of	time	and	effort	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">resolve	each	of	these	incidents,	and	it	was	incredibly	stressful	and	unnerving.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	did	this	happen?	What	did	your	parents	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	smile	is	twisted.	“My	dad	was	a	Garden	Party	activist.	In	his	day	job	he</p>

<p class="calibre1">he	sits	in	the	kitchen	watching	the	news	and	eats	a	meal	prepared	by	Leibniz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 newsreader	 is	 reporting	 a	 deadlock	 at	 the	 talks	 in	 Munich,	 when	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly	 looks	 surprised.	 A	 faint	 smile	 passes	 across	 her	 face	 before	 she recovers	her	composure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 says,	 “News	 just	 in:	 The	 US	 has	 successfully	 completed	 a	 daring</p>
<p class="calibre1">counterattack.	 We	 have	 footage,	 yes,	 released	 from	 Washington,	 actual	 footage of	 some	 of	 the	 action.	 I	 have,	 via	 satellite	 link	 from	 Washington,	 Commander Brian	Kips.	Commander,	I	understand	you	will	talk	us	through	what	happened.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	ma’am.	Yesterday,	when	our	bases	were	attacked,	we	were	able	to	trace</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	the	attacks	were	launched	from.	Many	of	the	aircraft	on	the	ground	at	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">bases	 were	 destroyed,	 but	 we	 did	 get	 some	 away.	 Fortunately,	 we	 also	 have	 a number	of	mobile	bases	for	hypersonic	aircraft	and	missiles.	We	needed	a	little</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	to	coordinate,	but	this	morning	we	managed	to	deploy	significant	resources</p>
<p class="calibre1">against	our	enemies	and	destroy	not	only	those	bases	we	know	were	responsible</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 the	 attacks	 on	 our	 servicemen	 and	 women,	 but	 many	 other	 key	 military targets	 as	 well,	 including	 intelligence	 command	 centres.	 We	 believe	 this	 action was	 necessary	 to	 disable	 any	 further	 attempts	 at	 aggression	 against	 us	 and	 our allies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	film	footage	was	taken	from	the	hypersonic	planes	and	has	been	slowed</p>
<p class="calibre1">considerably.	It	shows	one	explosion	after	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Commander	 Kips,	 please	 stay	 with	 us.	 We	 have	 more	 breaking	 news.	 We</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 reports	 that	 the	 Chinese	 moon	 base,	 space	 station,	 and	 several	 military satellites	have	been	destroyed.	Are	you	able	to	comment,	Commander?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	believe	that	is	true	information.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will	you	confirm	the	US	received	support	from	Japan	in	this	operation?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	not	able	to	confirm	at	this	time,	although,	as	you	know,	Japan	is	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>the	 nations	 under	 attack	 by	 China	 and	 Russia.	 They	 have	 the	 right	 to	 defend themselves.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	printer	in	his	mother’s	office	beeps.	The	beebot	is	ready. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 is	 the	 length	 and	 width	 of	 a	 little	 fingernail,	 scaled	 slightly	 from	 the blueprint	 of	 the	 agricultural	 version.	 It’s	 beautiful	 in	 its	 miniature	 perfection, complete	with	compound	eyes,	antennae,	thorax,	and	proboscis	but	no	sting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	carries	it	on	his	fingertip	to	the	kitchen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	 control	 the	 beebot	 he	 uses	 an	 off-the-shelf	 plug-in	 for	 the	 hologame</p>
<p class="calibre1">environment.	 Sitting	 in	 the	 Darkroom,	 he	 can	 drive	 the	 beebot	 using	 controls designed	for	a	flight	simulator	game,	and	he’s	inside	the	beebot.	His	perspective</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	beebot	scale,	and	through	its	eyes	the	world	is	huge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 takes	 off	 and	 flies	 around	 Leibniz	 in	 the	 kitchen.	 Through	 the	 tiny</p>
<p class="calibre1">cameras	on	the	front	of	the	machine,	Leibniz	is	the	size	of	a	skyscraper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 flies	 his	 spying	 machine	 along	 the	 kitchen	 counter,	 above	 the	 kitchen</p>
<p class="calibre1">table.	 Landing	 on	 top	 of	 the	 Canvas,	 he	 grasps	 onto	 the	 wafer-thin	 membrane with	the	tiny	claspers	at	the	end	of	the	beebot’s	feet,	and	then	he	takes	off	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he	 circles	 the	 kitchen,	 the	 dragons	 take	 after	 him,	 swatting	 at	 the	 robot insect.	If	they	were	able	to	make	contact,	they’d	send	it	plummeting	from	the	air, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	their	efforts	are	futile.	Looping	around	in	insect-like	randomness,	he	makes</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	dragons	hurtle	off	and	crash.	When	they	recover	and	come	back,	he	tries	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">engage	in	a	genuine	dogfight	with	them,	improving	his	mastery	of	the	controls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	flies	into	the	hallway,	takes	a	tour	around	the	living	room,	back	again	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	hall,	and	then	directly	up	the	stairwell,	dragons	in	tow.	Bringing	the	beebot	to rest	 on	 the	 landing	 carpet,	 he	 walks	 under	 his	 mother’s	 bedroom	 door,	 does	 a circuit	 around	 her	 bedroom,	 and	 then	 hovers	 by	 the	 keyhole,	 managing	 to	 land next	to	it	and	walk	through	to	the	other	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	few	hours	of	flying	the	beebot	around	the	house,	he’s	ready	for	its	real</p>
<p class="calibre1">mission. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later,	he	sits	with	his	mother,	watching	the	news. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Saul	 Justice,	 the	 prime	 minister,	 is	 being	 interviewed,	 announcing	 new</p>
<p class="calibre1">security	measures	to	be	rushed	through	Parliament	that	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Today,	 Parliament	 declared	 a	 state	 of	 emergency	 and	 passed	 legislation	 to help	 the	 emergency	 government	 make	 provisions	 for	 public	 safety	 and	 the</p>

<p class="calibre1">essential	 for	 us	 to	 carry	 on	 as	 normally	 as	 possible	 as	 a	 community	 in	 these exceptional	 times.	 Britain	 has	 a	 long	 and	 proud	 democracy,	 and	 it	 is	 always</p>

<p class="calibre1">“What	does	that	mean?”	Mathew	asks	his	mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	she	says.	“I	expect	we’ll	find	out	soon	enough.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">DAY	FIVE:	Friday,	26	November	2055,	London</p>
<p class="calibre1">After	his	mother	leaves	for	work	and	Mathew	has	had	breakfast	and	checked</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	school,	the	beebot	gets	one	more	test	flight	around	the	house.	Then	he	takes</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 to	 the	 front	 door,	 places	 it	 gently	 on	 the	 tiles	 in	 the	 porch,	 and	 goes	 to	 the Darkroom	 and	 logs	 in.	 A	 beebot-eye	 holographic	 view	 of	 the	 front	 garden</p>
<p class="calibre1">materialises	in	front	of	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Flying	the	little	machine	upwards,	he	avoids	the	olive	tree	and	moves	above</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	rooftops	of	the	houses	on	Pickervance	Road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 hasn’t	 occurred	 to	 him	 that	 anything	 would	 be	 different.	 As	 his	 mother requested,	he	stayed	in	the	house	on	Friday.	But	things	are	different. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through	 the	 eyes	 of	 his	 tiny	 robot,	 he	 sees	 military	 helicopters	 swarming across	London.	Soldiers	are	standing	by	anti-aircraft	guns	on	the	top	of	a	block</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 flats	 nearby.	 At	 the	 end	 of	 the	 street,	 there’s	 a	 roadblock	 and	 yet	 more soldiers.	It	crosses	his	mind	that	they	are	likely	to	have	surveillance	equipment</p>
<p class="calibre1">capable	of	recognising	his	beebot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Flying	 towards	 number	 twenty-one,	 he	 hovers	 around	 the	 front	 door, </p>
<p class="calibre1">searching	for	a	keyhole.	Many	people	nostalgically	keep	legacy	keyholes,	even</p>
<p class="calibre1">though	 keys	 are	 obsolete.	 A	 few	 years	 ago	 there	 was	 a	 fashion	 for	 having keyholes	fitted	on	doors	that	didn’t	have	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Number	 21	 doesn’t	 have	 a	 keyhole.	 There’s	 no	 quaint,	 old-fashioned</p>
<p class="calibre1">letterbox	to	be	wedged	open,	either.	The	door	is	flush	in	its	frame.	Manoeuvring</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	beebot	around	the	walls	of	the	house,	he	surveys	the	lower	floor.	The	back	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">sealed	by	the	conservatory;	there’s	no	way	in	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	flies	to	the	roof.	Some	of	these	old	houses	have	gaps	around	the	eaves,	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	knows	well,	because	a	few	years	ago	there	was	a	wasp’s	nest	in	their	own	loft. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	spends	several	minutes	searching	for	a	way	in	before	it	strikes	him	the	house</p>
<p class="calibre1">has	a	chimney.	There’s	no	way	of	knowing	whether	the	chimney	is	blocked	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	not,	unless	he	goes	down.	For	a	few	minutes	he	circles	the	red	clay	top	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">chimney,	peering	into	the	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	beebot	isn’t	fitted	with	lights	or	infrared	vision.	As	he	starts	to	descend, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he’s	blind,	but	he’s	able	to	use	the	intelligent	software	bundled	with	the	package</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’s	downloaded	to	auto-drive	the	beebot	by	bouncing	radar	off	the	brickwork.	If</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’d	 tried	 to	 drive	 himself,	 he	 would	 have	 become	 disorientated	 and	 likely crashed	the	little	robot	into	the	side	of	the	chimney. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a>As	it	happens,	Mr	Lestrange	hasn’t	blocked	off	his	chimney,	and	the	beebot comes	 into	 the	 light,	 flying	 around	 a	 room	 in	 number	 21.	 He	 loops	 around	 the light	fitting	and	lowers	the	beebot	onto	the	uncarpeted	floor,	then	turns	it	slowly</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	its	feet	to	get	a	360°	view	of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	 a	 bedroom.	 There’s	 a	 double	 bed	 with	 tree-trunk-sized	 wooden	 legs,	 a wardrobe,	and	a	sideboard	the	height	of	the	Shard	in	relation	to	the	beebot.	It’s	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">normal	bedroom,	except	it’s	meticulously	clean	and	tidy,	as	though	no	one	uses</p>
<p class="calibre1">it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Flying	 the	 beebot	 around	 the	 room,	 he	 notices	 that	 the	 wardrobe	 door	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">slightly	 ajar,	 and	 he	 squeezes	 into	 it.	 It’s	 full	 of	 clothes,	 neatly	 hung,	 unworn, and	like	new.	Carefully,	he	edges	free	again,	flies	to	the	door,	and	walks	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 floorboards	 on	 the	 landing	 shine,	 cleaner	 than	 those	 in	 Mathew’s	 own</p>
<p class="calibre1">house	 and	 surgically	 spotless.	 Perhaps	 Mr	 Lestrange	 has	 a	 newer	 model</p>
<p class="calibre1">HomeAngel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	scutters	along	the	hallway	with	tiny,	quick	bee	feet	and	under	the	door	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 bedroom	 at	 the	 front	 of	 the	 house,	 the	 one	 with	 the	 bay	 window,	 where Lestrange	watches	Clara. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	is	much	like	the	back	bedroom,	the	checklist	of	normality	all	present	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">terms	 of	 bedroom	 furniture,	 but	 also	 immaculate	 and	 unlived	 in.	 There	 are	 no personal	 possessions	 lying	 around,	 no	 worn	 clothes	 lying	 across	 chairs,	 no hairbrushes,	Papers,	ePinz,	or	spare	Lenzes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 these	 must	 be	 spare	 rooms.	 Mr	 Lestrange	 lives	 alone,	 and	 this	 is	 a	 big house	for	a	single	person.	He	walks	back	under	the	door	and	takes	a	quick	tour</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 bathroom,	 buzzing	 through	 the	 open	 door,	 noting	 the	 absence	 of	 any cleaning	robots	and	the	pristine	state	of	the	sink,	the	toilet,	and	the	shower. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	 another	 bedroom,	 the	 third	 and	 last.	 This	 room	 is	 empty	 but	 for	 an upholstered	armchair	and	a	telescope	on	a	stand	pointing	towards	an	unadorned</p>
<p class="calibre1">up-and-down	 sash	 fenestration,	 the	 size	 of	 a	 cathedral	 window	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">perspective	of	the	beebot.	It	has	a	view	across	the	back	garden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	house	is	a	mirror	image	of	his	own,	with	the	kitchen	at	the	back,	a	front</p>
<p class="calibre1">room,	 and	 a	 dining	 room.	 The	 kitchen	 extends	 into	 a	 conservatory	 containing some	 plants,	 orange	 and	 lemon	 trees,	 and	 a	 number	 of	 orchids	 on	 a	 small,	 low table.	 The	 kitchen	 is	 modern,	 containing	 the	 usual	 SuperChef	 Replicator	 food maker,	sink,	waste	disposal	unit,	cupboards	for	storage,	dining	table	and	chairs, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	fridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>Winging	 to	 where	 the	 old	 dining	 room	 is	 in	 his	 house,	 he	 crawls	 under	 the door	into	blackness.	It’s	a	Darkroom,	like	his,	with	a	couple	of	chairs.	There	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">small	boxes	in	the	top	corners	of	the	room	and	at	various	points	around	the	sides, </p>
<p class="calibre1">containing	cameras;	standard	equipment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	only	one	room	left.	He	crawls	under	the	door	to	the	front	room.	In	its</p>
<p class="calibre1">dimensions,	 it’s	 exactly	 like	 the	 room	 in	 Gen	 Lacey’s	 house	 and	 the	 mirror image	of	his	own	front	room,	with	large,	light	bay	windows	at	the	front.	But	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">room	doesn’t	have	a	sofa,	armchairs,	or	a	Canvas	like	most	lounges. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	a	library.	The	walls	are	fitted	from	floor	to	ceiling	with	bookshelves	filled</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	bursting	with	old	paper	books	of	the	type	people	rarely	keep	in	their	houses</p>
<p class="calibre1">anymore,	 unless	 they	 are	 special	 presents,	 like	 the	 Chinese	 books	 Ju	 Chen bought	 Mathew	 for	 his	 last	 birthday.	 It’s	 a	 lot	 like	 his	 grandmother’s	 library	 in Elgol. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 beebot	 flies	 alongside	 the	 shelves,	 its	 eyes	 combing	 decorative	 book</p>
<p class="calibre1">spines,	 some	 colourful,	 some	 with	 elaborate	 bindings	 and	 gold-leaf	 lettering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	their	titles,	they	are	history	books,	ordered	by	chronology	from	the	farthest</p>
<p class="calibre1">bottom	right	corner	of	the	room,	climbing	through	the	centuries	along	each	shelf</p>
<p class="calibre1">section.	 He	 flies	 past	 strange	 words:	 Palaeolithic,	 Neolithic,	 Mesopotamia, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harappan,	Egypt,	Kingdom	of	Kush,	Indus	Valley,	Vedic,	Xia,	Shang,	Sassanid, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Delian	 League,	 Maurya,	 Gupta,	 Dravidian,	 Aksumite.	 The	 letters	 are	 huge</p>
<p class="calibre1">compared	to	the	beebot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 there	 are	 more	 familiar	 words,	 like	 Greece,	 Rome,	 Byzantium, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottoman,	 Mayan,	 Aztecs.	 From	 things	 his	 grandmother	 has	 told	 him,	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognises	the	Qin	and	the	Han.	The	book’s	subjects	become	more	familiar:	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dark	 Ages,	 the	 Middle	 Ages,	 the	 Holy	 Roman	 Empire,	 the	 Renaissance,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Enlightenment,	 the	 French	 and	 Russian	 Revolutions,	 the	 Industrial	 Revolution, the	First	and	Second	World	Wars,	the	Cold	War,	Information	Age,	Globalisation, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 World	 Council.	 It’s	 like	 he	 is	 flying	 along	 human	 history	 itself.	 Then	 he notices	something	that	stops	him	in	his	tracks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Launching	from	the	shelf,	he	circles	the	beebot	around	the	room	to	go	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	survey	it	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	he	hasn’t	imagined	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	on	the	shelf	is	a	book	with	the	title	“World	War	III.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Landing	the	beebot,	he	stops	for	a	moment	to	make	sure	he’s	recording.	As</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 does	 so,	 the	 door	 to	 the	 room	 swings	 open	 and	 Mr	 Lestrange	 hurries	 to	 the table	standing	in	the	bay	window.	There’s	a	book	lying	there.	He	opens	the	cover</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 bends	 over	 it.	 Carefully,	 Mathew	 takes	 off	 from	 the	 shelf	 and	 flies	 to	 the table,	hovering	above	Mr	Lestrange’s	head.	From	here	he	is	able	to	take	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>book,	adjusting	the	focus	of	the	beebot’s	eyes	and	zooming	in	on	the	page. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lestrange’s	eyes	are	staring	at	the	words	on	the	left	page.	The	beebot	follows</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 words	 are	 rewriting	 themselves	 as	 Lestrange	 reads.	 The	 old	 words	 turn red,	a	line	runs	through	them,	the	letters	waver	for	a	moment	and	then	disappear</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	new	letters	and	words	appear.	The	beebot	focuses	in	further. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	reads:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 Erlang	 focuses	 the	 beebot	 cameras	 on	 the	 words	 in	 the	 book	 and	 starts	 to	 read what	is	written,	profoundly	shaken	to	realise	he	is	reading	about	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr	Lestrange’s	gaze	peels	from	the	book	as	he	turns	around.	Mathew	watches</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	Lestrange’s	hand	reaches	towards	the	beebot,	blocking	his	view	of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 doesn’t	 have	 time	 to	 react.	 In	 the	 Darkroom,	 his	 video	 feed	 suddenly	 goes dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 sits	 in	 his	 chair	 for	 several	 moments.	 What	 he	 has	 witnessed	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">impossible,	and	he’s	stunned,	not	trusting	his	own	eyes.	Then	he	remembers	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">recorded	it	all,	and	he	reboots	the	system	to	recover	the	file,	and	sets	it	to	play. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	nothing	but	static. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thinking	 he	 may	 have	 loaded	 the	 file	 incorrectly,	 he	 tries	 again.	 Still</p>
<p class="calibre1">receiving	 static,	 he	 initiates	 a	 routine	 to	 check	 for	 errors	 on	 the	 file.	 The	 file appears	to	be	fine.	He	keeps	trying,	unable	to	process	the	fact	that	he	has	no	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	knowing	whether	he	saw	something	irrational	or	is	losing	his	mind.	As	he	sits</p>
<p class="calibre1">there,	 trying	 the	 same	 things	 over	 and	 over	 in	 different	 order,	 something	 small comes	into	the	room.	It	takes	a	circuit	and	then	lands	on	the	back	of	his	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	the	beebot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	 else	 has	 taken	 control	 of	 it.	 Text	 flashes	 fleetingly	 in	 front	 of Mathew,	one	word	at	a	time.	It	says:	</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	think	this	is	yours.	It’s	a	nice	little	robot,	Mathew.	Why	don’t	you	use	it	to	talk	to Clara?	She’ll	like	it,	I’ll	bet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Best	regards, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your	neighbour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	Darkroom,	Mathew’s	head	is	spinning,	his	brain	struggling	to	process</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	words	that	just	floated	in	front	of	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he’s	interrupted	by	a	Consort	message	from	Clara. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi.	It’s	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	there!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	up	to?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>“I’ve	just	been	visiting	my	neighbour.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	in	person.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	get	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	explain	here.	I’ll	tell	you	when	you	come	round	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	sooner	has	he	hung	up	from	talking	to	Clara	than	he’s	pinged	again,	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	via	Charybdis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mathew.	It	is	me:	the	girl	building	you	a	world.	I	will	ring	your	holophone</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	Blackweb	via	a	scrambled	line	in	half	a	minute.	Please	accept	my	call.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 waits	 for	 thirty	 long	 seconds,	 and	 then	 the	 request	 comes	 through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Household	security	systems	kick	in:	“Unverifiable	call.	Maybe	a	virus	or	a	spam</p>
<p class="calibre1">call.	Warning.	Advise	not	to	accept.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	accepts	the	call. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eva	appears	before	him.	She	is	in	her	armchair	but	sitting	on	the	edge	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">seat	and	appears	nervous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	speak	long,”	she	says.	“My	father	is	at	home,	and	he	will	kill	me	if	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">discovers	I	am	calling	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 live	 on	 Tverskaya	 Street	 in	 Moscow,	 and	 yesterday	 there	 was	 a	 huge</p>
<p class="calibre1">military	 parade.	 The	 usual	 thing	 with	 tanks	 and	 missiles,	 but	 there	 were	 also soldiers	in	exoskeletons	and	proper	robot	soldiers,	seven	or	eight	feet	tall.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1">congregated	in	Red	Square	by	the	Kremlin.	There	were	a	lot	of	politicians	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">endless	boring	speeches;	it	was	all	over	the	TV.	It	was	ridiculous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyway,	 the	 Kremlin	 is	 closing	 shared	 services	 with	 enemy	 states.	 They</p>
<p class="calibre1">haven’t	shut	ordinary	Nexus	connections	yet,	but	I	think	that	will	happen	within</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	day	or	so.	They	have	shut	down	the	servers	I	have	with	you,	and	I	was	issued</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	a	warning.	The	whole	country	has	gone	insane.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eva,	 I	 am	 so	 sorry.	 The	 last	 thing	 I	 want	 to	 do	 is	 get	 you	 into	 trouble,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	 at	 all.	 You	 are	 not	 the	 problem.	 Anyway,	 I	 wanted	 to	 ask	 you,	 given your	 government	 is	 probably	 as	 mad	 in	 its	 own	 way,	 if	 you	 still	 wanted	 to continue.	It	will	take	me	a	day	or	so,	but	I’m	pretty	sure	I	will	be	able	to	build</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 world	 on	 servers	 on	 the	 Blackweb.	 I	 have	 all	 the	 code	 copied	 to	 offline storage.	I’ll	understand	if	you	think	it’s	too	dangerous,	but	I	suddenly	feel	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	doing	this	than	ever.	Do	you	think	I’m	a	lunatic?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eva	looks	crestfallen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	says,	“But	so	am	I.	Let’s	do	it	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>Eva	and	her	armchair	have	gone.	The	room	is	dark	and	then	.	.	. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Offer	 extended.	 Unbelievable	 value.	 Absolutely	 free	 technical	 stuff.	 Say</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Yes’	to	accept.	Why	wouldn’t	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Accept,”	Mathew	says.	“Hello,	Wooden	Soldier.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	call	me	No	Right	Turn.	You’re	Hard	Shoulder.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	No	Right	Turn.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Greetings,	Hard	Shoulder.	I	have	news.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great.	I	hope	it	wasn’t	risky.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!	 A	 little	 bit	 of	 hacking.	 So	 many	 organisations	 claim	 to	 have	 quantum security,	but	opening	government	and	corporate	records	is	as	easy	as	opening	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fridge.	 As	 it	 happens,	 you	 were	 right.	 Mr	 Lestrange	 of	 21	 Pickervance	 Road doesn’t	exist	or,	at	least,	not	in	a	normal	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	listening.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	does	have	a	social	security	number.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	is	disappointed.	“How	is	that	not	existing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait	a	minute.	Patience.	There	are	also	medibot	records,	an	ID	card,	a	bank</p>
<p class="calibre1">account,	and	a	passport. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	it	sounds	to	me	like	he	does	exist.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	of	his	records	are	registered	as	current,	but	none	were	updated	in	the	last</p>
<p class="calibre1">sixteen	 years.	 His	 bank	 account	 hasn’t	 been	 touched;	 it’s	 accumulated	 interest, though.	 He’s	 wealthy.	 It’s	 amazing	 what	 compound	 interest	 does	 with	 time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 are	 no	 deposits	 or	 withdrawals	 registered;	 he’s	 not	 left	 the	 country, although	his	passport	was	auto-renewed,	as	was	his	ID	card,	the	usual	in-person</p>
<p class="calibre1">interview	 waived.	 The	 weirdest	 thing	 is	 his	 medibot	 data.	 It’s	 absolutely</p>
<p class="calibre1">normal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	is	that	weird?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	 one’s	 medibot	 information	 is	 absolutely	 normal,	 unless	 the	 data	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">fabricated.	 Your	 man	 truly	 doesn’t	 exist,	 Hard	 Shoulder.	 If	 it’s	 okay	 with	 you, I’m	 going	 to	 examine	 his	 home	 network,	 try	 and	 get	 in	 and	 see	 if	 that	 reveals anything	interesting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	sure	you	want	to?	What	if	you	get	caught?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Na,	no	bother.	I’m	curious	now,	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	his	mother	gets	home,	he’s	sitting	in	the	kitchen,	staring	at	the	beebot</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’s	placed	on	the	table	in	front	of	him.	Mr	Lestrange	and	his	library	have	got	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hoshi	is	dazed	with	tiredness	and	preoccupied,	but	then,	she	always	is	these</p>
<p class="calibre1">days.	 Leibniz	 serves	 her	 dinner,	 and	 she	 starts	 to	 eat	 in	 silence,	 intent	 on	 her food. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>After	a	while,	she	looks	up,	remembering	herself,	and	says	to	Mathew,	“How was	your	day?	You	did	stay	in,	didn’t	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	stayed	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nods	slightly	and	carries	on	eating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what	did	you	do	all	day	all	alone	in	the	house	with	no	school?	Were	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">working	on	your	dragons?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually,	 I	 was	 working	 on	 that,”	 he	 indicates	 with	 his	 head	 the	 little adapted	crop	pollinator. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	beebot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here.	 Hold	 your	 hand	 flat.”	 He	 carefully	 places	 it	 on	 her	 palm.	 “It’s	 a miniature	robot.	I	had	the	idea	in	our	group	class	on	Thursday.	It	doesn’t	seem</p>
<p class="calibre1">much,	 but	 I’m	 able	 to	 fly	 it	 using	 software	 in	 the	 Darkroom.	 It	 has	 inbuilt cameras.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	amazing.	So	tiny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually,	it’s	a	3D	print	of	an	industrial	model	for	pollinating	crops	from	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">blueprint	on	the	Nexus.	I	made	it	a	little	prettier	and	added	the	cameras.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 puts	 the	 beebot	 back	 in	 his	 palm.	 “It’s	 wonderful,	 but	 isn’t	 it	 work? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shouldn’t	you	be	doing	something	different	on	your	day	off?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	enjoy	doing	these	things.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	exercise?	Did	you	go	for	a	run	using	the	holovision?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	shakes	his	head.	“I	was	too	busy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 not	 sure	 this	 curfew	 is	 good	 for	 you.	 You	 need	 to	 do	 some	 exercise	 –</p>
<p class="calibre1">otherwise,	 we’ll	 be	 having	 our	 GP	 ringing	 up	 wanting	 to	 review	 your	 medibot records,	 threatening	 to	 cancel	 your	 insurance.	 At	 least,	 play	 an	 active	 game	 or something.	Anything	to	get	you	moving.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	I	will.	I	promise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	do	anything	else?	Speak	to	anyone?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	recalls	Eva	and	Wooden	Soldier.	“No,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hope	this	curfew	is	over	soon	and	we	can	get	back	to	normal.	You	need	to</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	think	it	likely	now,	with	the	war?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sighs,	“No.	No,	I	don’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">your	road.	Or	you.	Have	you	thought	of	that?” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Where	do	you	think	they’re	taking	them?”	Mathew	asks	his	mother,	but	she</p>

<p class="calibre1">A	 mile	 from	 their	 house,	 there’s	 a	 makeshift	 passport	 office	 in	 tents	 and marquees	 on	 land	 belonging	 to	 Woolwich	 Artillery.

<p class="calibre1">They	 make	 it	 inside	 one	 of	 the	 tents.	 A	 woman	 in	 uniform	 takes	 their	 ID</p>

<p class="calibre1">She	waves	them	through	into	the	tent,	where	there’s	a	waiting	area.	They	sit</p>

<p class="calibre1">Suddenly	 there	 are	 raised	 voices	 in	 the	 next	 room.	 Two	 of	 the	 soldiers</p>
<p class="calibre1">standing	to	one	side	in	the	waiting	room	glance	at	one	another	and	rush	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 tent	 flap.	 A	 few	 minutes	 later	 they	 burst	 into	 view	 with	 a	 struggling	 man grasped	between	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	are	fascists!”	the	man	is	shouting,	his	voice	hysterical.	“This	is	fascism! </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	cannot	do	this!	Let	go	of	me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	slips	free,	but	the	soldiers	immediately	grab	him	again.	They	struggle,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 falls	 to	 the	 floor;	 one	 of	 them	 sits	 on	 him,	 and	 the	 other	 one	 ties	 his	 hands behind	his	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bastards!”	the	man	spits,	between	his	teeth.	His	red,	angry	face	is	squashed</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	ground.	Mathew	remembers	the	guard	in	front	of	Gen	Lacey’s	house	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">feels	sick	to	his	stomach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Swearing	and	protesting,	the	man	is	taken	from	the	tent.	A	little	later,	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	soldiers	is	standing	near	Mathew’s	seat.	Mathew	leans	across	and	whispers	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">him,	“The	man	you	arrested,	what	did	he	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 soldier	 smiles	 at	 him,	 good-humoured	 enough,	 conspiratorial.	 “Least</p>
<p class="calibre1">said,	soonest	mended,	eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew’s	 mother’s	 number	 is	 called.	 She	 stands	 and	 smiles	 at	 him.	 “Don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">worry.	It	will	all	be	fine,”	she	says	and	disappears	through	the	tent	flap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	minutes	later,	his	own	number	floats	before	him	with	an	invitation	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">join	 the	 main	 tent.	 A	 solider	 lifts	 the	 tent	 flap	 for	 him.	 There	 is	 another	 tent beyond,	 partitioned	 into	 three	 rows	 of	 interview	 booths,	 separated	 by	 tall freestanding	panels.	As	he’s	led	to	his	booth,	he	passes	his	mother	seated	in	front</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	a	table,	a	man	in	a	suit	talking	to	her	and	working	away	at	a	Paper,	a	woman</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	a	lab	coat	standing	to	one	side,	preparing	something	on	the	top	of	a	tall	trolley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s	urged	forward	and	directed	into	a	booth	with	another	woman	in	a	lab	coat</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	another	man	behind	a	desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 lifts	 his	 gaze,	 unsmiling,	 and	 stares	 at	 Mathew	 with	 suspicious, </p>
<p class="calibre1">appraising	 eyes	 for	 a	 moment	 past	 politeness,	 and	 then	 says,	 “You	 are	 Mathew Erlang?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sit	down.”	The	man	turns	to	his	Paper	and	starts	to	work	at	it.	“ID	card,”	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">says,	staring	at	his	screen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 pulls	 his	 ID	 card	 from	 his	 pocket	 and	 places	 it	 on	 the	 desk.	 Still focusing	his	eyes	on	his	Paper,	the	man	grasps	it,	scans	it	with	a	barcode	reader, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>and	then	puts	it	through	a	shredder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nurse,”	the	man	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roll	up	your	sleeve,”	the	nurse	says	to	Mathew.	She	is	no	friendlier	than	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	behind	the	desk.	She	is	cold	in	her	uniform.	Her	skin	has	goose	bumps.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">weather	is	turning,	as	it	does,	suddenly	and	with	no	warning.	There	is	no	heating</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	tents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 nurse	 has	 a	 needle	 attached	 to	 a	 wire,	 which	 in	 turn	 is	 attached	 to	 a machine	at	the	top	of	the	trolley.	She	swabs	Mathew’s	arm	roughly	and	plunges</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	needle	into	his	median	cubital	vein.	The	machine	makes	a	series	of	beeps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Confirmed,”	the	nurse	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Congratulations,”	the	man	behind	the	desk	says,	glaring	at	Mathew	from	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">Paper.	 “You	 are	 who	 you	 say	 you	 are.	 You’re	 lucky	 you	 have	 medibots.	 Your mother’s	corporate	healthcare	plan,	I	suppose.	It	makes	this	whole	process	a	lot</p>
<p class="calibre1">quicker.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	nurse	presses	a	cotton	pad	with	disinfectant	onto	the	puncture	wound	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 inside	 of	 Mathew’s	 arm	 and	 puts	 his	 fingers	 across	 it,	 indicating	 he	 should hold	it	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	going	to	ask	you	some	questions,	while	the	nurse	prepares	your	chip,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	man	says.		“You	are	not	British.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	British.	I	was	born	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	look	British.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	mean	I’m	not	white?	Neither	is	66%	of	the	population.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 is	 smiling	 slightly.	 “Your	 father	 was	 Danish.	 Your	 mother	 is	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">mixed	Chinese	and	Japanese	lineage.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Chinese	connection	is	worrying,	don’t	you	think?	Given	the	war?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	mother	is	a	British	citizen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know.	But	she	was	born	in	China.	It	must	be	confusing	for	you	both,	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">war.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	what	way?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	to	support.	Who	do	you	support?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	live	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	an	evasive	answer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	British.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	 think	 me	 rude,	 but	 I	 won’t	 be	 the	 last	 person	 asking	 you	 these</p>
<p class="calibre1">questions.	A	better	response	would	be,	‘I	support	Britain,	America,	and	her	allies</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	will	do	all	in	my	power	to	ensure	they	win	this	war.’	Something	along	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">lines.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anger	rises	within	him.	He	thinks	of	the	man	being	pinned	to	the	floor	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a>waiting	room	and	the	guard	attacking	him	in	Gen	Lacey’s	garden.	Taking	a	long controlled	 breath,	 he	 tries	 to	 suppress	 the	 blood	 flushing	 from	 his	 neck	 to	 his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	believe	in	this	country,”	Mathew	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 nurse	 takes	 the	 wad	 of	 cotton	 from	 Mathew’s	 arm,	 replaces	 it	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">another,	and	covers	it	with	a	plaster.	“Bend	forward.”	She	moves	him	so	his	head</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	bowed	and	loosens	his	shirt	from	around	his	neck,	pulling	back	the	material. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	tries	to	turn	to	watch	what	she	is	doing.	She	forces	his	head	forwards,	firmly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	experience	a	small	sting,”	she	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	cold	presses	against	his	skin,	and	then	there	is	a	hard	punch	and	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sensation	something	like	an	insect	bite.	He	draws	his	breath	sharply	between	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	done,”	the	nurse	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Congratulations,”	 the	 man	 across	 the	 desk	 says	 again.	 “Welcome	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world	 of	 the	 living.	 Your	 bioID	 is	 active	 immediately.	 You	 will	 find	 it	 has	 a number	of	useful	purposes,	apart	from	allowing	you	to	continue	to	live	in	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">home.	There’s	information	on	our	web	site,	as	well	as	a	store	where	you	can	buy</p>
<p class="calibre1">compatible	 applications	 and	 appliances.	 You	 may	 go,”	 the	 man	 says,	 smiling	 a small,	pained	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 walks	 back	 to	 the	 waiting	 room,	 where	 his	 mother	 is	 sitting.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">draws	 his	 fingers	 across	 the	 back	 of	 his	 neck,	 where	 there	 is	 a	 spreading numbness.	 There’s	 also	 a	 small	 lump	 there,	 like	 the	 lump	 in	 O’Malley’s	 neck, where	he	has	his	ID	chip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay?”	his	mother	says,	standing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nodding	his	response,	he’s	not	sure	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back	 in	 his	 room,	 Mathew	 is	 sitting	 on	 his	 bed	 with	 his	 back	 to	 the	 wall recalling	the	morning.	He	can	feel	the	chip	under	his	skin,	or	at	least	he	imagines</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 can.	 Somewhere	 in	 an	 office	 building,	 in	 a	 grey	 cubicle	 overhung	 with	 bad strip	lighting,	an	SIS	workstation	running	complex	algorithms	is	registering	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">new	 bioID	 and	 assimilating	 all	 the	 data	 that’s	 available	 about	 him,	 making connections,	 categorising,	 assessing,	 and	 rating	 him	 for	 risk.	 A	 computer	 has recorded	his	movements	back	from	Woolwich.	It	knows	he’s	now	sitting	in	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">bedroom.	 It	 knows	 when	 he	 logs	 on	 to	 the	 Nexus.	 It	 knows	 that	 his	 heart	 is beating	 a	 little	 too	 fast,	 that	 he	 is	 anxious,	 agitated.	 But	 it	 doesn’t	 know,	 yet, what	he	is	thinking	and	what	he	is	planning	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he	 stares	 at	 the	 rotating	 lunar	 landscape	 cycling	 on	 the	 far	 wall	 of	 his room,	 a	 message	 materialises	 in	 front	 of	 him.	 An	 advert	 for	 security	 software:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Act	quickly	to	take	advantage	of	this	once-in-a-lifetime	offer!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>“Accept,”	Mathew	says,	smiling.	“Who	am	I	today?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	Difficult	Child	–	I’m	Sleeper.	I	have	news.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	all	ears.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ithaca	 is	 unhackable.	 I	 know	 this	 will	 not	 especially	 impress	 you,	 but	 it impresses	 me.	 At	 first,	 I	 thought	 there	 wasn’t	 even	 a	 network	 there.	 There	 is	 a fairly	normal	one,	however,	and	something	else,	something	beyond	any	kind	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology	I’ve	ever	seen;	and	it’s	all	rolled	in	a	kind	of	wrapper	like	an	opaque, </p>
<p class="calibre1">slick,	 wet	 ball.	 Once	 you	 think	 you	 have	 a	 handle	 on	 it,	 it	 slips	 through	 your fingers,	but	not	in	any	brutal	kind	of	way.	It’s	a	curious	thing.	It’s	like	it	smiles	at you	 before	 it	 goes.	 It’s	 way	 beyond	 me.	 I’d	 like	 to	 get	 some	 other	 friends	 to check	it	out.	Are	you	okay	with	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	for	it,”	Mathew	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pings	Clara.	“Back	home,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	was	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Horrible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does	it	hurt?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	 much.	 It	 just	 makes	 me	 feel	 terrible.	 Like	 I’m	 no	 longer	 in	 control	 of myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	never	were.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	guess.	I	have	news	about	our	friend.	Can	you	come	over	tomorrow?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	for	a	short	while.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later,	 Mathew	 and	 Hoshi	 are	 sitting	 in	 the	 kitchen	 watching	 the	 Canvas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 have	 eaten.	 A	 newsreader	 is	 announcing	 that	 the	 government	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">investigating	plans	to	ban	the	Blackweb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	mother	studies	him	and	says,	“I	don’t	want	to	know	what	you’re	up	to.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t	 want	 you	 to	 explain,	 but	 please	 be	 careful.”	 She	 rises	 slowly.	 “I’m exhausted.	I’m	going	to	have	an	early	night	for	once.”	She	leaves	the	room	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">climbs	the	stairs	slowly,	wearily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	Leibniz	is	cleaning	around	him,	a	written	message	comes	through	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	Lenz.	It’s	from	an	unknown	sender.	It	says:	</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Don’t	believe	everything	you	hear.	Trust	what	you	know.	Remember	the	Nexus	is	physically</i> <i class="calibre4">in	 the	 control	 of	 the	 SIS.	 The	 Blackweb	 is	 not.	 Learn	 to	 use	 quantum	 key	 distribution. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Photons	 generate	 an	 encryption	 key	 and	 anyone	 intercepting	 the	 key	 touches	 the	 photons. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">They	 can’t	 find	 you	 without	 telling	 you	 they	 are	 searching	 for	 you.	 Work	 with	 people	 you</i> <i class="calibre4">trust	to	create	a	maze	to	play	in.	They	will	never	find	you. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	is	this?”	Mathew	messages	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	there	is	no	response. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">15	Letting	Go	the	Dragons</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">DAY	SEVEN:	Sunday,	28	November	2055,	London</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 wakes	 early	 and	 lies	 awake	 pondering	 the	 dragons	 and	 Project</p>
<p class="calibre1">Yinglong.	Still	in	his	bedclothes,	he	sits	at	his	desk	and	works	on	some	fixes	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">align	 with	 Eva’s	 code	 base.	 Building	 a	 little	 routine,	 he	 addresses	 the	 bulk	 of differences	 in	 syntax	 and	 edits	 the	 rest	 by	 hand.	 It’s	 easier	 than	 he	 anticipated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s	 decided	 to	 upload	 an	 updated	 version	 of	 the	 dragons’	 code	 base	 to	 Eva’s world,	so	the	dragons	can	grow,	breed,	and	evolve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	mother	says	her	goodbyes	through	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	O’Malley	in	there	with	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	he’s	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	let	him	out,”	she	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	won’t!”	he	replies	with	slightly	less	conviction	than	he	used	to	have. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 breakfast,	 he	 checks	 into	 the	 school	 register	 and	 browses	 through	 the modules	he	has	planned	to	complete,	but	he	doesn’t	have	any	enthusiasm	for	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wandering	 aimlessly,	 he	 finds	 himself	 in	 the	 Darkroom	 and	 logs	 on	 to	 the Blackweb,	where	he	finds	Eva	present	and	sends	her	a	message. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	you	talk?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 armchair	 materialises	 in	 the	 Darkroom.	 She	 has	 her	 legs	 curled	 up	 in	 it and	appears	as	comfortable	as	O’Malley	does	in	his	bed	upstairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’s	the	robot	soldier	rally	going?”	he	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ve	 taken	 their	 sabre	 rattling	 on	 tour.	 It’s	 in	 St	 Petersburg	 now.	 TV’s still	 full	 of	 it,	 though.	 Good	 news	 is	 my	 dad	 has	 gone.	 He’s	 a	 propagandist	 or journalist,	take	your	pick,	for	one	of	our	state-sponsored	channels.	He’s	gone	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">cover	the	circus,	and	I’m	home	alone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great!	Because	the	dragons	are	ready	to	be	released.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	to	know.	Your	world	awaits	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our	government	is	threatening	to	close	the	Blackweb.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	ours	too.	But	it’s	all	talk.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	you	said	so	last	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	didn’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quantum	key	distribution.	Remember?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 know	 it’s	 one	 of	 the	 reasons	 they’re	 going	 to	 have	 trouble	 shutting	 us down,	but	I	didn’t	message	you	last	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Someone	did.	It	came	through	on	the	Blackweb	as	an	anonymous	message.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>thought	it	was	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	odd.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	I	don’t	know	who	else	it	could	be.”	He	thinks	of	his	hacker	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or	maybe	I	do	.	.	.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 could	 be	 a	 scatter	 message	 from	 some	 of	 the	 people	 on	 Psychopomp	 or MUUT	 reassuring	 their	 user	 base.	 They	 might	 be	 worried	 people	 will	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">frightened	 off	 the	 service.	 There	 are	 some	 things	 you	 should	 be	 doing,	 if	 you don’t	 know	 already,	 to	 set	 traps	 around	 your	 connection	 and	 also	 to	 jump	 to random	locations.	I’ve	virtualised	all	my	data	and	hidden	it	dispersed	in	different</p>
<p class="calibre1">places.	 The	 virtual	 worlds	 I’ll	 create	 for	 you	 will	 be	 literally	 no	 place.	 But	 the first	one	is	set	up,	so	we	should	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	give	me	access,	I’ll	upload	the	Yinglong	code.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doing	 so	 now.	 Get	 your	 bits	 done	 and	 then	 meet	 me	 here	 in	 five	 minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve	established	some	additional	security.	It	represents	itself	visually	to	you,	and I	want	to	show	you	how	to	get	through	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	receives	a	location	and	then	an	invitation	to	a	holosession	and	pulls	on	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">skullcap.	He	doesn’t	sit,	having	a	notion	this	session	will	be	interactive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	few	moments	of	darkness,	foliage	begins	to	grow	all	around	him.	A</p>
<p class="calibre1">single	 leaf	 at	 first	 sprouts	 from	 the	 Darkroom	 floor,	 curling	 upwards	 on	 a thickening	 stem,	 then	 others	 grow	 from	 the	 ceiling,	 crawling	 across	 the	 back wall.	He	has	to	move	his	foot	as	tendrils	grasp	at	his	ankle.	Moving	through	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">spreading	green,	he	brushes	leaves	and	branches	from	his	face.	Then	before	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	a	 large	 wooden	door	 at	 the	top	 of	 some	 grey	steps	 in	 a	high	 stone	 wall.	The door	has	a	round	rusted	iron	handle.	He	tries	to	open	it,	but	it’s	locked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	need	to	do	this.”	Eva	is	suddenly	beside	him:	a	diminutive	person,	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">head	barely	reaches	his	shoulder.	He	likes	that	she	hasn’t	chosen	to	appear	as	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">avatar.	 Or	 perhaps	 she	 has.	 He	 supposes	 he	 wouldn’t	 know.	 She	 runs	 her	 hand along	the	wall.	“Three	across,	fourteen	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pi.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiles.	“We’ll	keep	changing	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	brick	comes	loose.	She	retrieves	a	large	key. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	no	keyhole,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	pulls	a	knife	from	a	belt	around	her	waist	he	hasn’t	noticed	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	one	too,”	she	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looks	down	at	his	waist.	So	he	has. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 cuts	 her	 finger	 and	 smears	 a	 symbol	 on	 the	 door.	 It’s	 the	 Greek	 letter gamma.	“Again,	we’ll	change	it	regularly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>A	lock	appears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	did	you	do	that?”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	reading	my	bioID.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	got	those	too,	huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	had	them	for	ages.	There	were	never	any	civil	liberties	to	speak	of	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Russia,	remember.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	suppose	not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	enable	it	for	you	too,	so	you	can	come	in	on	your	own,	anytime	you	like. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’ll	need	to	exchange	a	bit	of	data	after	this	session.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eva	puts	the	key	in	the	lock,	and	the	door	swings	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 step	 into	 a	 large	 open	 space.	 A	 fertile	 grassland	 spreads	 before	 them, spotted	with	moss-covered	granite	rocks,	rolling	to	mountains,	skirted	by	forests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	a	lush	alpine	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	amazing,	Eva,”	Mathew	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	start	to	walk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	dragons	are	over	there,”	Eva	says,	pointing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 sees	 two	 crates,	 the	 sort	 used	 to	 transport	 animals,	 with	 wooden	 plank sides	 and	 bars	 at	 the	 front.	 As	 they	 approach,	 he	 spots	 the	 dragons,	 larger	 and wilder	than	the	ones	he	has	in	the	house.	They’re	restless	in	the	confined	space</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	come	to	the	front	of	their	crates,	biting	at	the	bars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	should	let	them	go,”	Eva	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.”	Mathew	climbs	onto	one	of	the	crates,	the	one	housing	the	female,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">raises	 the	 bars.	 She	 comes	 crashing	 towards	 them,	 stretching	 her	 wings, </p>
<p class="calibre1">breathing	fire.	The	grass	in	front	of	her	singes	black.	In	this	world	her	actions	do have	 consequences.	 Mathew	 is	 grateful	 it’s	 only	 his	 virtual	 body	 that’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">vulnerable	 to	 harm.	 The	 female	 looks	 back	 toward	 her	 mate	 and	 lets	 go	 a tinnitus-inducing	screech. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	climbs	onto	the	second	crate	and	frees	the	male.	In	keeping	with	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">programming,	the	second	dragon	leaves	the	crate	more	cautiously,	sniffing	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">unfamiliar	grass,	and	spooking	when	Mathew	jumps	off	the	box. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	dragons	go	to	one	another,	bashing	heads	and	wrapping	necks.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">female	surveys	acres	of	sky.	She	beats	her	wings	and	lifts	off,	whirling	around, </p>
<p class="calibre1">climbing	higher	and	higher	above	their	heads,	catching	thermals.	The	little	male</p>
<p class="calibre1">clumsily	follows	after	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 watch	 for	 a	 while	 as	 the	 dragons	 fly	 into	 the	 distance,	 their	 bodies illuminating	periodically	with	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	you	may	have	a	few	forest	fires	on	your	hands,”	Mathew	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eva	 shrugs.	 “Hey,	 it’s	 your	 world,”	 she	 says.	 Then,	 turning	 and	 nodding	 in the	direction	of	the	forest	behind	them,	she	says,	“I	built	you	a	hut,	in	case	you</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>wanted	to	come	in	here	and	explore	and	watch	them	for	real,	as	it	were,	and	stay for	 a	 while.	 There’s	 real	 weather	 in	 this	 world,	 you	 know,	 and	 it’s	 not	 always nice.	Of	course,	you	may	prefer	to	watch	them	on	your	Paper.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 leads	 the	 way	 to	 a	 little	 copse.	 Sheltered	 amongst	 the	 trees	 is	 a	 small wooden	house.	They	go	inside.	It’s	furnished	rustically,	with	a	log	fire	blazing	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	wood	burner,	a	rug	on	a	rough	wood	floor,	and	a	rocking	chair	with	a	blanket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	Russian	hunting	lodge,”	she	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	love	it,”	Mathew	says.	“Thank	you,	Eva.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 the	 only	 house	 in	 any	 of	 my	 worlds.	 If	 you	 go	 through	 this	 door	 here, there’s	a	shortcut	back	to	reality.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	follows	her	through	and	finds	himself	back	in	the	Darkroom,	facing	her	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	armchair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 that	 was	 fun!”	 she	 says.	 “I’d	 better	 run.	 Let’s	 keep	 in	 touch.	 If	 you want	to	discuss	the	world,	or	the	dragons,	or	anything	else,	let	me	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	will,	for	sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 four	 o’clock	 he’s	 standing	 at	 his	 bedroom	 window.	 Clara’s	 car	 makes	 its appearance	 in	 spite	 of	 the	 newly	 erected	 roadblocks,	 and	 he	 wonders	 if	 she’s chipped	too	by	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr	 Lestrange	 does	 not	 appear	 in	 his	 bay	 window.	 He	 thinks	 about	 what</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wooden	Soldier	/	No	Right	Turn	/	Sleeper	said	about	Lestrange’s	home	network</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	impenetrable	and	hopes	his	hacker	friends	are	having	some	luck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 turns	 his	 gaze	 back	 to	 the	 road.	 Clara	 is	 staring	 right	 at	 him.	 She holds	 up	 her	 hand,	 half	 a	 salute,	 half	 a	 solidarity	 wave,	 and	 he	 mimics	 her gesture.	She	smiles	and	he	smiles	back,	and	then	she	disappears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Automatically,	 he	 turns	 from	 the	 window	 and	 runs	 down	 the	 stairs.	 Clara’s car	is	just	turning	out	of	the	street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	steps	over	to	the	front	door	of	the	house	next	door.	There	is	no	bell, </p>
<p class="calibre1">so	he	knocks	and	waits.	Time	passes.	The	door	remains	closed.	He	knocks	again, </p>
<p class="calibre1">louder.	The	door	stays	firmly	shut	in	the	sphynx-like	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 looks	 at	 the	 window.	 The	 curtains	 are	 drawn.	 He’s	 never	 noticed	 them</p>
<p class="calibre1">drawn	before,	but	then	he’s	never	really	paid	attention.	He	tries	one	last	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr	Lestrange!”	he	says	loudly	to	the	unresponsive	door.	He	opens	the	Nexus</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	searches	for	the	house	in	the	freely	available	directory,	but	then,	of	course,	it isn’t	there.	Lestrange	has	never	broadcast	any	data.	It’s	like	his	house	is	sealed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever	is	in	there,	he	really	doesn’t	want	anyone	knowing	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	glances	over	his	shoulder.	Across	the	line	of	garden	walls,	he	can	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 roadblock	 at	 the	 end	 of	 Pickervance	 Road.	 A	 couple	 of	 the	 soldiers	 are staring	 his	 way.	 He	 decides	 on	 a	 tactical	 retreat	 and	 goes	 back	 inside	 his	 own</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clara	comes	at	five.	They	go	to	his	room.	He	offers	her	his	seat	at	his	desk, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sits	on	the	edge	of	his	bed,	and	gives	her	a	summary	of	what	he	and	his	hacker</p>
<p class="calibre1">friend	have	done	to	find	out	about	Mr	Lestrange. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	might	just	have	been	out,”	she	says	when	he	tells	her	about	knocking	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don’t	 think	 so.	 I	 don’t	 think	 he	 goes	 out.	 Cars	 don’t	 visit	 his	 house.	 I’ve never	seen	him	on	the	street.	It’s	so	frustrating.	His	house	is	just	there,	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	wall.	Last	night	I	was	lying	awake	thinking	maybe	I	should	just	break	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	not	going	to	do	that!	Seriously?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	Of	course	not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 turns	 to	 scan	 the	 bay	 window.	 “You	 haven’t	 seen	 him	 in	 the	 window</p>
<p class="calibre1">again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	shakes	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	eyes	drop	to	his	desk,	and	she	sees	the	beebot.	“What’s	this?”	she	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	this	the	thing	you	sent	down	his	chimney?”	She	glances	at	him.	He	nods.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">says,	“Can	I	pick	it	up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	you	can’t	break	it.	It’s	pretty	tough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	so	small!”	She	turns	it	over	in	her	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	need	a	way	to	talk	to	one	another,”	he	says.	“Privately,	without	fear	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	listened	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can’t	I	just	come	here?”	she	asks,	smiling	cheekily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiles,	then	blushes	and	coughs.	“You	can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	both	laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	says,	“But	we	can’t	really	chat	on	Consort.	It	would	be	good	if	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	chat	the	way	I	talk	to	Wooden	Soldier.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hate	Consort	anyway.	It’s	a	meat	market.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly.	 And	 Nexus	 is	 mainlined	 to	 SIS.	 I	 wanted	 to	 talk	 to	 you	 privately because	of	what	you	said	about	your	parents.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	what	do	you	suggest?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Guess.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow…	The	Blackweb?	No!	Isn’t	that	illegal?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually,	it’s	not	illegal.	The	prime	minister	is	only	threatening	to	outlaw	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	hasn’t	done	it	yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	it’s	full	of	criminals	and	terrorists,	isn’t	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	never	met	any,	if	it	is.	But	then	I	haven’t	used	it	long,	to	be	honest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Won’t	SIS	track	us	using	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	lot	harder	for	them	to	monitor	us	on	the	Blackweb	than	on	the	Nexus. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>But	if	you’re	worried,	I	won’t	do	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually,	I	think	it’s	kind	of	exciting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiles.	She	smiles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	wouldn’t	know	how	to	start.	How	do	you	even	access	it,	anyway?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	examines	the	beebot	again	and	remembers	Mr	Lestrange’s	message,	Why</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t	you	use	it	to	talk	to	Clara?	He	says,	“I	have	an	idea,	but	I	don’t	know	if	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	make	it	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	might	be	able	to	turn	the	beebot	into	a	Blackweb	communication	device.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	guard	is	pinging	me,”	she	says,	standing	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 shows	 her	 downstairs.	 At	 the	 door,	 they	 reach	 for	 the	 latch	 at	 the	 same time,	 feel	 a	 sudden	 spark	 of	 electricity,	 and	 withdraw	 their	 hands	 like	 they’ve been	bitten. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry!”	they	say	at	the	same	time	and	laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	steps	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	catches	his	eye,	serious	now,	“Please	be	careful.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	will,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	she’s	gone,	he	sits	at	his	Paper	and	starts	to	edit	the	beebot	blueprint.	As</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	works,	he	listens	to	a	recording	of	Clara	playing.	Music	is	her	gift	to	him,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinks,	so	he	will	send	her	something	in	return. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	great,	Leibniz,”	his	mother	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	Mathew,	she	feels	compelled	to	thank	the	robot	for	the	things	it	does. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	welcome,”	Leibniz	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	getting	new	locks,”	Hoshi	says	to	Mathew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	wrong	with	the	old	ones?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing,	 but	 now	 we	 can	 use	 our	 bioID	 to	 open	 the	 doors	 rather	 than	 a hackable	digital	key	fob	we	might	lose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Surely	our	bioID	details	are	freely	available	to	the	security	services.	Doesn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	mean	they	can	march	in	here	anytime	they	want	to?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	with	these	locks,”	his	mother	says,	holding	her	son’s	gaze	and	smiling, </p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhat	mischievously,	he	thinks.	“Anyway,	the	locksmiths	are	coming	at	2:30</p>
<p class="calibre1">tomorrow	afternoon	to	fit	them,	front	and	back	of	house	and	all	of	the	windows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will	you	let	them	in	and	make	sure	O’Malley	doesn’t	get	out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course.	No	problem.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">16	The	Beekeeper</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">DAY	EIGHT:	Monday,	29	November	2055,	London</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nan	 Absolem	 is	 sitting	 in	 her	 office.	 The	 war	 has	 killed	 her	 exuberance,	 or perhaps	she	thinks	it’s	a	more	fitting	setting	to	pass	on	bad	news. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	afraid	it’s	no	go	with	Eva	and	your	dragons	project,	Mathew.	I’m	sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	considers	whether	he	should	tell	her	that	he’s	already	started	working	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eva.	He	thinks	better	of	it	and	says,	“Oh.	Bad	news.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 doesn’t	 notice	 how	 flat	 his	 voice	 sounds.	 She	 says,	 “Yes.	 I	 know.	 I	 did try.	I	argued	that	your	project	would	be	a	symbol	and	hope	of	peace,	a	beacon	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	darkness,	but	the	school	board,	the	regional	education	board,	and	the	police</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought	it	would	be	a	security	risk.	I	hope	you’re	not	too	upset.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	it’s	fine.	Really.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 afraid	 it	 means	 we	 still	 need	 to	 find	 a	 way	 to	 get	 you	 collaboration credits.	We’re	scheduling	a	holophone	session	on	the	Nexus	with	your	robotics</p>
<p class="calibre1">class.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alright.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	okay?”	she	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	unusually	agreeable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	bioIDed	yesterday,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	official	who	processed	me	said	I	wasn’t	British.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Outrageous!	Did	you	complain?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	to?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nan	thinks.	She	doesn’t	know	what	to	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 says,	 “Don’t	 worry,	 Nan.	 I’m	 going	 to	 do	 some	 courses	 on	 quantum</p>
<p class="calibre1">computing	and	security,	if	that’s	okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,	that’s	fine.	Do	you	need	anything	from	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	Thanks.	Not	a	thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	locksmiths	arrive	at	2:30	on	the	dot,	a	tall,	thin,	grey-haired	man	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">moustache,	 wearing	 a	 shirt	 and	 tie,	 and	 a	 younger	 man	 wearing	 jeans	 and	 a sweatshirt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	the	men	are	bringing	in	their	tools,	Mathew	holds	O’Malley.	“We	don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">want	 him	 to	 get	 out,”	 he	 says	 to	 the	 younger	 man.	 “I’ll	 put	 him	 in	 here.”	 He indicates	the	Darkroom.	“The	police	will	shoot	him	if	he	escapes,	and	there’s	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>roadblock	at	the	end	of	the	street	now,	so	the	chances	are	high.	Make	sure	you don’t	open	the	door.	It’s	important.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	there	any	doors	or	windows	in	your	Darkroom?”	the	younger	locksmith</p>
<p class="calibre1">asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	we	won’t	be	going	in	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	fixes	the	Darkroom	with	all	the	things	O’Malley	needs	–	food,	water, </p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 bed,	 and	 his	 litter	 tray.	 O’Malley	 scratches	 at	 the	 door	 and	 jumps	 and stretches	 at	 the	 door	 handle,	 wanting	 to	 be	 freed.	 Mathew	 feels	 guilty,	 so	 he starts	a	holofilm	for	the	cat.	It’s	a	natural	history	film.	O’Malley	starts	to	chatter and	leap	at	the	birds	flying	across	his	path. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	shuts	the	door	tightly	behind	him	and	goes	to	the	front	room	while</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	men	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 works	 on	 the	 beebot,	 turning	 it	 into	 a	 Blackweb	 communications</p>
<p class="calibre1">device.	 Based	 on	 a	 course	 provided	 by	 the	 school	 curriculum	 and	 a	 bit	 of research	on	MUUT	about	the	quantum	security	his	anonymous	friend	suggested, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	manages	to	build	something	he	is	fairly	sure	will	allow	him	to	have	a	private</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversation	 with	 Clara.	 The	 first	 beebot	 was	 primitive	 in	 design,	 an	 off-the-shelf	 agricultural	 model.	 Last	 night	 he	 printed	 a	 new	 beebot	 for	 Clara	 with flourishes.	 It’s	 covered	 in	 tiny	 gold	 and	 black	 hairs,	 has	 iridescent	 eyes,	 and long,	elaborate,	tightly	curling	antennae.	The	finished	product	is	like	a	pendant</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	a	brooch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	leaves	the	beebot	on	the	doorstep,	waiting	for	Clara	to	arrive,	and	retreats</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	Darkroom.	The	miniature	robot	is	now	in	the	air,	circling	the	street	light</p>
<p class="calibre1">outside,	and	through	its	eyes	he	watches	as	her	car	drives	up	Pickervance	Road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 she	 exits	 the	 car,	 she	 looks	 up	 at	 his	 bedroom	 window.	 The	 shadow	 of disappointment	 passing	 across	 her	 face	 when	 she	 realises	 he	 isn’t	 there	 makes him	exhilarated,	but	also	slightly	ashamed	of	himself.	He	flies	the	beebot	behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">her,	at	a	low	level,	avoiding	the	suspicious,	sunglassed	gaze	of	the	guard.	It	zips</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	and	around	quickly	and	lands	on	her	collar,	gripping	on	with	tiny	carbon-fibre</p>
<p class="calibre1">beebot	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	puts	through	a	message	request.	Knowing	it	will	get	through	to	Clara	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	unrecognised	incoming	message,	he	says,	“This	is	Mathew.	I’ve	managed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	what	I	said	I	might.	I	need	you	to	download	some	software.	Please	accept	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">prompt.”	She	accepts,	the	software	installs,	and	then	he	says,	“The	small	insect</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	just	landed	on	your	jacket	is	mine.	It	will	allow	us	to	talk	in	private.	If	you are	okay	with	this,	please	don’t	knock	it	off.	Also,	could	you	please	wave	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">window?	I’m	not	there	right	now,	but	then	I	will	know	the	beebot	works	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>didn’t	stay	awake	all	night	making	this	thing	for	nothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clara	raises	her	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	smiling	back.	I’ll	add	video	for	you	at	some	point,”	he	says.	“Will	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">leave	it	on	while	you	play?	I’d	like	to	listen.”	He	isn’t	going	to	tell	her	he’s	been listening	to	her	for	days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	says,	“You’ll	find	it	boring.	It’s	classical	stuff.	Most	people	our	age	don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	it.	Can	you	hear	me	alright?”	She	smiles	at	the	guard,	who	she	knows	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">assume	she	is	making	a	normal	e-Pin	call. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	can	hear	you,	and	I	will	like	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	you	know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hear	you	playing	through	our	front	wall	every	afternoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	god,	really?	I’m	sorry.	I	didn’t	realise	the	walls	were	so	thin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	they’re	like	paper.	But	don’t	be	sorry.	You	are	amazing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hardly.	But	thanks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	travel	into	Gen	Lacey’s	house	together.	He	manages	to	manoeuvre	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">beebot	so	it	is	facing	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sits	at	the	piano,	and	he	watches	her	hands	dance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 the	 end	 of	 her	 lesson	 he	 waits	 for	 her	 to	 say	 goodbye	 to	 her	 teacher.	 As Gen	moves	into	the	hallway,	Clara	whispers,	“Don’t	go.	Let’s	speak	when	I’m	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	car.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	waits	for	the	guard	to	shut	the	door	on	her	and	for	the	car	to	start	to	drive</p>
<p class="calibre1">away	before	she	says	“Hi.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	mind	if	I	move?”	Mathew	says.	“From	this	angle	I	can’t	see	much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	at	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	detaches	the	tiny	beebot	feet	from	her	collar,	flies	to	her	knee,	and	focuses</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Better?”	she	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	bit,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	this	better?”	She	offers	her	hand.	He	crawls	the	beebot	into	her	palm,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	lifts	it.	“Is	it	too	close?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	lens	is	adjustable.	There,”	he	says.	“Perfect.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	different.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it	too	weird?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiles. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>“Are	you	still	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	I’m	smiling.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 can’t	 see	 you,	 remember?	 I	 only	 have	 the	 bee.	 It’s	 sweet	 but	 not	 very expressive.	It’s	different	from	the	other	one.	Where	did	you	get	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	made	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	made	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	got	a	template	on	the	Nexus.	Where	are	you	now?”	he	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	 show	 you,”	 and	 she	 gently	 grasps	 the	 beebot	 between	 her	 thumb	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">index	finger	and	puts	it	on	the	edge	of	the	passenger	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	not	going	to	the	river.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	I	live	in	Wandsworth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	come	a	long	way	for	a	piano	lesson.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	just	a	piano	lesson.	Gen	is	a	pretty	special	teacher.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know.	I	searched	for	you	both	on	the	Nexus.	You’re	famous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmmm	.	.	.	amongst	those	interested	in	young	people	who	play	piano	music, </p>
<p class="calibre1">perhaps.	But	yes,	Gen	is	famous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	even	notable	in	my	class	at	school.	Not	in	a	good	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	build	things	like	this	bee.	That’s	much	more	impressive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 nice	 of	 you	 to	 say	 so,	 but	 any	 hobbyist	 would	 be	 able	 to	 build	 one	 of these.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	never	seen	one	before.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only	because	you	don’t	live	on	a	farm.	Beebots	are	used	as	crop	pollinators</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	places	where	they	still	grow	biofood,	because	there	aren’t	enough	real	bees	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">pollinate	crops.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	beebots	normally	talk?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	done	something	clever	and	original	with	it.	I	wouldn’t	know	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	start.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	would	never	be	able	to	play	Bach.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	you	know	I	was	playing	Bach?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 dad	 loved	 classical	 music,	 especially	 piano	 music.	 Bach	 was	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">favourite	composer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gen	told	me	your	dad	passed	away.	I’m	so	sorry,	Mathew.”	When	he	doesn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">respond,	she	says,	“What	do	I	do	with	the	beebot?	Does	it	fly	home?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Keep	it.	If	you	ever	want	to	chat,	say	‘Call	the	beekeeper’	to	it,	and	it	will</p>

<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	locksmiths,	the	older	man,	is	standing	in	the	doorway	wearing	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">guilty	expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	cat,”	he	says.	“It	was	in	the	Darkroom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	Mathew	says.	“I	put	him	there	because	there	are	no	windows	or	doors</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	Darkroom.	Your	colleague	said	you	wouldn’t	need	to	go	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	didn’t	tell	me.”	He	says	this	like	it’s	Mathew’s	fault.	“I	thought	you	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	there.	I	came	to	check	what	you	wanted	us	to	do	with	the	old	locks.	The	back</p>

<p class="calibre1">Mathew	scrambles	to	his	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 rushed	 past	 me.	 I	 tried	 to	 grab	 him,”	 the	 locksmith	 says,	 following</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	as	he	runs	along	the	hallway,	through	the	kitchen,	and	into	the	garden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	starts	to	search	frantically.	O’Malley	is	nowhere	to	be	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	see	where	he	went?”	Mathew	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	jumped	the	wall,	I	think.”	The	locksmith	gestures	towards	Gen	Lacey’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">garden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.	 Okay.”	 Mathew	 rushes	 back	 through	 the	 hallway,	 through	 the	 front</p>
<p class="calibre1">door,	and	out	onto	the	pavement	to	Gen’s	house.	He	leans	on	the	doorbell.	After</p>
<p class="calibre1">too	 many	 agonising	 seconds	 Gen	 answers,	 smiling.	 “Hi,	 there!”	 She	 sees	 his face.	“What’s	up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“O’Malley’s	run	away	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	no!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	he	may	be	in	your	garden.	Do	you	mind	if	I	look?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	 course	 not.”	 Gen	 leads	 the	 way	 through	 her	 house.	 “How	 did	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">escape?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	 having	 new	 locks	 fitted.	 The	 bioID	 compatible	 ones.	 Mum	 ordered</p>
<p class="calibre1">them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gen	opens	the	back	door,	and	they	go	into	the	garden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“O’Maaalleeey!”	 Mathew	 calls.	 “O’Malley?”	 He	 gets	 on	 his	 hands	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">knees,	peering	under	bushes,	running	his	hands	into	the	dark	spaces	at	the	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">near	the	fence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Damn	 cat,”	 he	 says.	 “He’s	 here	 somewhere.	 He	 knows	 I’m	 after	 him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bloody	creature	is	ignoring	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	wants	some	freedom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 but	 if	 a	 policeman	 catches	 him,	 he’ll	 be	 shot.	 Okay	 to	 stand	 on	 this chair?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be	my	guest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>Mathew	gets	on	the	garden	chair	and	peers	over	the	fence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	can’t	have	gone	far.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	we	go	door	to	door	and	tell	people	he’s	missing?	I’ll	go	and	talk</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	soldiers	on	the	roadblock	at	the	end	of	the	street	and	let	them	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,	Gen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	problem	at	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	follows	Gen	onto	the	street	and	starts	knocking	on	doors,	speaking	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">neighbours	he’s	never	met	before.	There’s	no	response	from	number	21,	but	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">manages	 to	 find	 someone	 in	 at	 all	 the	 other	 houses.	 The	 All-Day	 Curfew	 has grounded	most	people	from	their	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gen	comes	back	from	her	visit	to	the	roadblock.	“The	soldiers	were	actually</p>
<p class="calibre1">really	nice.	They	said	if	they	find	O’Malley,	they’ll	bring	him	back	to	you.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1">won’t	shoot	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 sighs.	 “Thanks,	 Gen.”	 He	 runs	 his	 hand	 through	 his	 hair.	 “Mum	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	to	go	crazy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	she	won’t.	And	anyway,	he’ll	come	home.	He’s	stretching	his	legs.	Cats</p>
<p class="calibre1">always	come	home	eventually.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	8:30	in	the	evening.	Mathew	is	sitting	in	his	mother’s	bedroom	scanning</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	neighbour’s	garden	with	the	night	vision	in	his	Lenz.	If	he	hadn’t	given	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">beebot	 to	 Clara,	 he	 could	 have	 used	 it	 to	 hunt	 for	 O’Malley.	 He	 considers	 the spare	 in	 his	 bedroom	 and	 is	 on	 the	 verge	 of	 fetching	 it	 when	 he	 catches movement	 in	 his	 peripheral	 vision.	 He	 turns	 his	 head	 quickly,	 scanning	 for	 the source,	his	Lenzes	taking	a	moment	to	refocus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	first	he	can’t	distinguish	it.	Then	a	grainy	image	reveals	itself	to	him.	In</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	shadow	of	an	overhanging	tree,	on	the	wall	separating	the	gardens	of	number</p>
<p class="calibre1">19	 and	 number	 21,	 is	 a	 blackbird,	 flicking	 its	 tail,	 watchful.	 It’s	 alert	 to something.	 The	 bird	 stands	 poised	 to	 take	 off,	 its	 head	 cocked,	 watching, listening.	 Even	 in	 the	 poor	 light	 the	 yellow	 of	 its	 beak	 and	 the	 ring	 around	 its eyes	are	striking.	It’s	such	a	rare	sight	Mathew	is	mesmerised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	realises	why	the	bird	is	agitated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 the	 other	 end	 of	 the	 wall,	 his	 chin	 and	 chest	 on	 the	 bricks,	 O’Malley	 is poised	in	stalking	position,	sizing	up	the	bird,	calculating	a	strike.	He	watches	in horror	as	O’Malley’s	rump	rises	and	wiggles	the	way	it	does	before	he	pounces</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	 he	 even	 knows	 what	 he’s	 doing,	 Mathew	 is	 running	 down	 the	 stairs, through	 the	 house,	 and	 out	 the	 back	 door.	 The	 bird	 is	 startled	 by	 the	 noise	 of Mathew	crashing	into	the	garden	and	takes	flight.	O’Malley	leaps	and	catches	it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">disappearing	on	the	other	side	of	the	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>“Damn,”	Mathew	says.	Pushing	the	garden	bench	against	the	wall,	he	climbs up	 and	 peers	 across	 the	 top	 of	 the	 glass	 roof	 of	 the	 conservatory.	 O’Malley	 is sitting	in	the	middle	of	a	pane	of	glass	with	the	blackbird	in	his	jaws.	When	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">spots	Mathew,	he	starts	to	growl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“O’Malley,	 drop	 it!”	 he	 whispers	 loudly.	 But	 O’Malley	 has	 no	 such</p>
<p class="calibre1">intention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	hauls	himself	onto	the	wall	and	sits	astride.	The	bird	may	be	already</p>
<p class="calibre1">dead	–	it’s	impossible	to	tell.	O’Malley	watches	him	carefully	but	doesn’t	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	ponders	whether	the	conservatory	roof	will	take	his	weight.	He	tests	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	one	foot	and	then	another,	lowering	himself	tentatively,	still	bearing	most	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	load	with	his	arms	clinging	to	the	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	roof	is	sturdy,	he	decides. </p>
<p class="calibre1">O’Malley	 is	 still,	 but	 his	 aquamarine	 eyes	 follow	 Mathew	 as	 he	 edges</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Drop	the	bird,	O’Malley!”	Mathew	says,	lunging	forward,	and	grabbing	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cat	by	the	scruff	of	the	neck.	Taking	a	grip	of	O’Malley’s	mouth,	he	levers	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">jaws	open	and	releases	the	bird.	Miraculously,	it	flies	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 pulls	 the	 cat	 to	 his	 chest	 in	 a	 bear	 hug	 and	 starts	 to	 edge	 back towards	the	wall.	O’Malley	kicks,	hard,	raking	the	skin	on	Mathew’s	wrists	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 long	 claws	 on	 his	 back	 feet.	 Mathew	 loses	 his	 grip	 and	 then	 his	 footing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">O’Malley	jumps	free,	and	Mathew	topples. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	lands	hard	on	the	roof	and	has	a	moment	to	register	that	it	doesn’t	seem	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">solid	as	he	thought,	before	it	gives	way	beneath	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 takes	 him	 only	 a	 second	 to	 fall,	 but	 as	 is	 the	 way	 of	 these	 things,	 it	 feels much	 longer.	 In	 that	 fraction	 of	 time,	 his	 brain	 has	 long	 enough	 to	 register surprise	and	note	that	he’s	falling	ten	feet	to	the	floor	on	plates	of	glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	lands,	he	freezes	for	several	moments,	breathing.	Then	he	lifts	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands	 off	 the	 glass	 slowly,	 checking	 for	 blood.	 There’s	 a	 piece	 of	 broken	 glass stuck	to	the	palm	of	his	left	hand,	but	remarkably	he’s	not	bleeding.	He	carefully</p>
<p class="calibre1">picks	off	the	glass	and	drops	it	on	the	floor	amongst	the	rest	of	the	debris,	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">lifts	his	arms	and	comes	slowly	to	his	knees,	finding	a	place	to	put	his	hand	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">support.	 Once	 on	 his	 feet,	 he	 examines	 his	 trousers,	 feels	 his	 legs.	 Amazingly, nothing	is	hurt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	floor	is	a	mess.	Bits	of	glass	are	shattered	across	the	tiles.	In	addition	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	section	of	the	roof	that’s	now	on	the	floor	in	pieces,	the	blinds	are	partially</p>
<p class="calibre1">torn	and	hanging,	bits	of	string	and	canvas	and	shrilk	trailing	around	him	like	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">broken	sail.	The	orange	trees	are	crushed	and	the	orchids	have	been	thrown	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	pots	and	are	lying	prone,	roots	akimbo,	in	scattered	soil.	He	raises	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a>There’s	a	gaping	hole	in	the	roof	of	the	conservatory.	The	night’s	sky	is	visible through	it.	Grey	clouds	cross	a	bright	moon;	between	them,	dim,	blinking	stars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	has	destroyed	Mr	Lestrange’s	conservatory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 reflects	 on	 how	 Lestrange	 will	 react.	 Somehow	 he	 can’t	 imagine	 him</p>
<p class="calibre1">angry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	all	the	noise,	he’s	amazed	no	one	has	come	rushing	in.	The	door	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">kitchen	 is	 shut,	 and	 he	 worries	 whether	 it’s	 locked	 and	 he’s	 trapped	 in	 the conservatory	 until	 Lestrange	 finds	 him;	 but	 when	 he	 tries	 it,	 it’s	 open.	 The kitchen	 and	 hallway	 are	 in	 darkness.	 As	 he	 walks	 forward,	 the	 lights</p>
<p class="calibre1">automatically	come	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello?”	he	says,	moving	towards	the	front	door.	“Mr	Lestrange?	Hello?	Mr</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lestrange,	are	you	there?”	There’s	no	response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Across	 the	 hallway	 is	 the	 door	 to	 the	 library.	 “Mr	 Lestrange!”	 he	 raises	 his voice	to	carry	through	the	house	and	goes	up	the	stairs.	“Hello?”	Pushing	open</p>
<p class="calibre1">each	 bedroom	 door	 in	 turn,	 knocking	 before	 he	 does	 so,	 he	 finds	 the	 house empty.	Each	room	is	as	pristine	as	he	saw	it	through	the	eyes	of	the	beebot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Downstairs,	he	tries	the	Darkroom	and	then	goes	into	the	library. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here	 are	 the	 books	 –	 the	 gold	 leaf	 on	 the	 spines	 glinting	 in	 the	 bright	 light hanging	from	the	ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 table,	 an	 antique	 with	 veneered	 surfaces	 shined	 to	 a	 high	 polish,	 has nothing	on	it.	The	books	he	saw	Lestrange	reading	have	been	cleared	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scanning	along	the	shelves,	following	history	around	the	room,	as	he	saw	via</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	beebot,	the	books	are	arranged	chronologically	starting	with	ancient	history, </p>
<p class="calibre1">all	the	way	to	modern	affairs.	World	War	III:	The	First	Space	War	is	on	the	shelf</p>
<p class="calibre1">nearest	the	door,	but	it’s	not	the	last	book	on	the	shelf.	It	isn’t	even	the	last	shelf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	sweeps	the	spines.	The	titles	don’t	make	sense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 are	 books	 on	 the	 Second	 Space	 War.	 Something	 called	 The	 End	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe	 and	 the	 USA:	 The	 Atlantic	 States	 Treaty	 and	 the	 Founding	 of	 ATLAS</p>

<p class="calibre1">Control	through	Manmade	Viruses	at	the	End	of	the	Twenty-First	Century. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kneeling	next	to	World	War	III,	he	extracts	it	by	its	spine	and	flicks	through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	 a	 chapter	 on	 the	 destruction	 of	 the	 US	 Battlestars	 and	 the	 subsequent destruction	 of	 the	 Chinese	 moon	 base.	 It	 describes	 Russia’s	 push	 into	 Europe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 these	 things	 have	 actually	 happened	 in	 the	 past	 couple	 of	 days.	 It’s	 strange but	 not	 beyond	 possibility	 that	 Mr	 Lestrange	 would	 have	 written	 about	 these things	 already.	 But	 the	 book	 appears	 to	 describe	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 war,	 the	 use	 of robot	soldiers	and	hypersonic	planes	and	the	critical	role	of	wireless	solar	power</p>
<p class="calibre1">beamed	 from	 space	 in	 enabling	 the	 US	 and	 the	 Western	 allies	 to	 push	 an</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">It	must	be	some	kind	of	game</i>,	he	thinks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	puts	the	volume	back	and	browses	along	to	the	very	last	book	on	the	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">last	 shelf.	 Its	 title	 is	 Fin.	 It’s	 a	 thick	 volume	 with	 a	 blue	 cloth	 cover	 and	 silver lettering.	He	stands,	opens	it,	and	walks	to	the	table,	where	he	puts	it	down	so	he</p>

<p class="calibre1">He	looks	back	at	the	bookshelves	and	spies	something	he	hadn’t	noticed.	It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	book	–	the	one	Mr	Lestrange	was	reading	when	he	discovered	the	beebot,	a</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">On	 the	 fourteenth	 of	 February	 2091,	 Mathew	 Erlang	 delivered	 his	 second	 public	 lecture</i> <i class="calibre4">concerning	 Project	 Yinglong	 in	 the	 auditorium	 at	 Silverwood	 University.	 It	 was	 the</i> <i class="calibre4">greatest	day	of	his	career	and	the	last	day	of	his	life. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 chapter	 is	 long;	 he’s	 impatient	 and	 hurriedly,	 clumsily	 flips	 through	 to the	end.	His	hands	are	shaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Stupid</i>,	he	says	to	himself.  <i class="calibre4">Not	real.	Not	real. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 spite	 of	 the	 fact	 that	 Erlang	 modelled	 the	 Yinglong	 on	 downloads	 of	 his own	brain	patterns,	he	perversely	neglected	to	record	his	own	DNA	and	so	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">irretrievably	lost	.	.	. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	book	literally	flies	from	his	hand	and	slams	into	the	wall.	He	scrambles</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	his	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a> <i class="calibre4">That	did	not	happen. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Adrenaline	 is	 pumping	 round	 his	 body.	 In	 spite	 of	 being	 gripped	 by	 cold</p>
<p class="calibre1">terror,	 his	 rational	 mind	 knows	 he	 must	 have	 somehow	 lost	 control	 of	 his muscles	and	thrown	the	book.	He	takes	a	few	steps	towards	it	and	bends	to	pick</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	moves	away	from	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 is	 at	 the	 front	 door	 before	 he	 knows	 what	 has	 happened,	 yanking	 at	 the lock	and	the	handle.	But	it	is	shut	firm. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Who	locks	a	door	from	the	inside? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr	Lestrange?”	he	says,	louder	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 silence	 in	 the	 house	 swallows	 his	 words.	 The	 empty,	 still	 house	 now</p>
<p class="calibre1">seems	sinister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through	the	kitchen	to	the	conservatory,	picking	his	way	through	the	hanging</p>
<p class="calibre1">bits	of	blind,	he	finds	the	conservatory	door	and	rattles	the	handle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Locked	as	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	considers	trying	to	climb	through	the	hole	above	him,	fetches	a	chair	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	kitchen	and	stands	on	it,	but	standing	on	tiptoes	he	only	just	brushes	the	roof</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	his	fingertips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	gets	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	occurs	to	him	to	try	the	Nexus.	Perhaps	if	he	logs	on	to	the	house	network, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 might	 unlock	 the	 doors,	 or	 summon	 Mr	 Lestrange.	 His	 Lenz	 returns	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">message	of	“No	networks	found.”	This	is	impossible	in	London.	The	signal	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	house	should	be	available,	but	he	can’t	even	see	it,	meaning	he	can’t	call	Gen</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lacey	and	he	can’t	even	call	his	mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Going	through	the	kitchen	drawers	to	look	for	the	key	to	the	back	patio	door, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	finds	cutlery,	plates	–	all	gleaming,	clean,	and	new	like	everything	else	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">house.	He	opens	the	cupboards	and	the	fridge	for	good	measure.	There	is	food, </p>
<p class="calibre1">what	you	would	expect	for	a	single	man,	but	there’s	nothing	going	off,	nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">mouldy,	nothing	half-opened.	And	he	realises	he	hasn’t	met	a	HomeAngel	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">house.	He	goes	back	into	the	hallway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr	Lestrange?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	pointless. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>The	library	door	looms	beside	him,	but	he	doesn’t	want	to	go	back	in	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	only	the	Darkroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pushes	open	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	one	of	the	chairs	there’s	a	naked,	coverless	skullcap.	Reasoning	that	if	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">connects	to	Mr	Lestrange’s	holophone,	he’ll	be	able	to	get	a	Nexus	connection	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	 help,	 he	 puts	 the	 skullcap	 on,	 half	 expecting	 to	 be	 rejected	 by	 the authentication	system. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he’s	standing	in	a	long	white	corridor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 doors,	 ceiling,	 and	 floor	 are	 all	 white.	 There	 is	 no	 obvious	 source	 of light,	but	it’s	blindingly	bright.	Turning	360°	to	see	where	he	came	from,	there’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing	but	a	corridor	stretching	on,	apparently	endlessly,	and	door	after	door	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">white	as	the	floor,	walls,	and	ceiling.	The	door	nearest	him	is	locked.	So	is	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">next	one	and	the	one	after	that.	He	tries	them	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Standing	in	the	corridor,	he	tries	to	quell	the	rising	panic. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	 a	 game,	 probably	 a	 puzzle.	 I’ve	 played	 similar.	 There’s	 always	 an	 exit from	virtual	worlds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps	 you	 have	 to	 open	 two	 door	 handles	 at	 the	 same	 time.	 Perhaps	 only the	twentieth	door	you	try	opens.	He	tries	both	of	these	strategies	to	no	avail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Think,	Mathew.	Think. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 he	 keeps	 walking,	 the	 corridor	 might	 bend	 at	 some	 point,	 or	 end	 with	 an opening	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps	an	object	or	a	menu	will	appear	to	tell	me	what	to	do	next. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Up	 ahead	 he	 notices	 something	 that	 appears	 to	 have	 materialised	 out	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">nowhere,	 something	 hanging	 on	 a	 wall,	 a	 smudge	 of	 yellow,	 the	 only	 coloured object	in	the	monotonous	white,	and	he	quickens	his	pace	to	investigate. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">And	there	it	is! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">On	a	peg	on	the	wall,	a	parachute	hangs	by	one	of	its	shoulder	straps,	along</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 some	 old-fashioned	 motorcycle	 goggles.	 Is	 he	 meant	 to	 put	 them	 on?	 He studies	the	door	in	front	of	him.	As	he	turns	the	handle	and	leans	his	weight	in, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	doesn’t	expect	it	to	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	it	does. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Losing	 his	 balance,	 he	 falls	 forwards.	 The	 instinctive	 part	 of	 his	 brain</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>responds	before	he	even	knows	what	he’s	seeing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	tries	to	pull	him	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 one	 wonderful,	 timeless,	 elegant	 moment	 he	 teeters	 on	 the	 edge	 of	 the doorframe,	the	self-preserving	animal	part	of	him	trying	to	manipulate	muscles</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	do	miraculous	things,	to	fight	gravity	and	pull	him	back	towards	the	corridor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	it	doesn’t	work.	Gravity	wins,	and	he	is	falling	forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he	 does,	 he	 raises	 his	 eyes,	 and	 in	 that	 unforgettable	 second	 he	 sees	 the impossible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfolding	before	him	is	a	landscape	so	vast	it	fades	at	the	horizon.	A	forest,	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">canopy	of	trees	stretching	away	in	all	directions,	a	muddy	brown	river	shining	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	sun,	snaking	sleepily	through	the	trees.	He	is	thousands	of	feet	above	all	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">this.	Or	he	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	he	is	falling. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">18	Four	Days</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">DAY	 EIGHT:	 Thursday,	 16	 June	 2472,	 Chukotka	 Autonomous	 Okrug, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Siberia,	Russia</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pain.	Sharp,	piercing	pain.	Something	is	biting	him,	and	he	wakes	suddenly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	light.	He	checks	his	Lenz	for	the	time,	but	the	time’s	not	there.	He	has	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">clock.	 It	 feels	 like	 he	 has	 been	 asleep	 only	 a	 short	 while.	 The	 sun	 is	 blazing bright.	 He	 feels	 the	 pain	 again.	 There’s	 an	 ant	 on	 his	 hand.	 Shaking	 his	 wrist, frantically,	he	knocks	it	off	and	examines	his	skin.	There’s	a	red	welt,	which	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">sucks	and	then	spits.	There	are	things	crawling	on	him.	Sitting,	he	sees	a	line	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">large	 red	 ants	 marching	 across	 his	 legs,	 clambering	 over	 his	 ankles,	 sniffing	 at him.	With	disgust,	he	whacks	at	them	with	strands	of	the	vine	rope	he	brought	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	him	the	night	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 rubs	 sleep	 from	 his	 eyes	 and	 recalls	 his	 journey	 here;	 the	 long	 white corridor,	 the	 long	 fall	 from	 the	 sky	 over	 the	 forest,	 the	 astonishing	 view,	 the plunge	into	the	deep	lake.	His	lungs	are	still	sore	from	almost	drowning.	His	skin</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	burnt	from	lying	in	the	sun	to	dry.	He	has	cuts	and	bruises	from	trying	to	climb</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	tree.	He	has	never	played	a	game	as	real	as	this	in	his	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shuffling	 to	 the	 edge	 of	 his	 tree	 house,	 he	 peers	 out.	 Between	 gaps	 in	 the foliage,	 the	 river	 bubbles	 away.	 Carefully,	 he	 slides	 down	 the	 trunk,	 cursing	 at his	 screaming	 feet;	 he	 grasps	 his	 walking	 pole	 from	 where	 he’d	 left	 it	 propped against	 the	 tree,	 and	 goes	 to	 the	 water	 for	 a	 drink.	 The	 river	 is	 wide	 and	 deep here.	It	runs	flat	and	steady.	Branches	and	leaves	are	carried	along	in	the	swim, </p>
<p class="calibre1">washed	 from	 the	 riverbanks	 by	 the	 storm.	 His	 stomach	 rumbles,	 empty	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">churning	with	hunger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Last	night,	as	he	gathered	leaves	in	the	rain,	he	spied	something	like	bananas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Going	back	to	the	plant	he	broke	the	leaves	from,	sure	enough,	a	few	feet	above</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	head	are	small,	dull	yellow	bunches.	He	yanks	on	a	branch	and	breaks	off	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fistful.	 On	 the	 ground,	 legs	 crossed,	 he	 snaps	 a	 fruit	 away	 and	 peels	 it.	 It’s	 not the	 best	 banana	 he’s	 ever	 eaten,	 but	 it	 is	 edible.	 He	 bolts	 the	 rest	 hungrily	 and then	goes	back	to	the	tree	and	gathers	some	more	bunches.	Grabbing	some	strips</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 bark	 he	 used	 to	 bind	 the	 leaves	 the	 night	 before,	 he	 strings	 the	 bananas together	and	hangs	them	across	his	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s	no	longer	hungry	or	thirsty,	and	he’s	slept	some,	but	he’s	tired.	Between</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 gaps	 in	 the	 canopy	 above	 him,	 blue	 sky.	 The	 river	 is	 gushing	 along	 at	 his side.	The	forest	is	alive	with	noise.	Gripping	his	stick	in	his	hand,	he	sets	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>After	walking	for	hours	without	event,	preoccupied	by	the	pain	in	his	feet,	he is	sitting	at	the	side	of	the	river,	eating.	The	sun	is	high	in	a	bright	blue	sky,	but there’s	also	the	moon	hanging	over	the	forest,	huge	and	low.	As	he	stares	at	it,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">hears	a	distinct	snap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	 is	 moving	 along	 the	 bank	 on	 the	 other	 side.	 Mathew’s	 eyes	 rake along	the	forest	edge,	staring	into	the	dark	places	between	the	leaves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	takes	him	a	while,	but	eventually	he	sees	it.	A	pair	of	almond-shaped,	green</p>
<p class="calibre1">cat’s	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	animal	comes	further	into	the	daylight.	It’s	not	a	breed	he	recognises.	It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	size	of	a	large	dog,	powerfully	built,	with	muscular	shoulders.	Big	enough	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">fell	 a	 cow,	 a	 horse	 .	 .	 .	 a	 human.	 It	 is	 staring	 right	 at	 him.	 Brazenly.	 Not	 at	 all afraid.	 There	 is	 no	 doubt	 at	 all	 where	 it	 places	 itself	 in	 the	 food	 chain	 in	 this particular	 encounter.	 Its	 tail	 flicks	 ever	 so	 slightly.	 It	 yawns.	 It	 licks	 its	 lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 has	 never	 felt	 like	 prey	 before,	 but	 he	 does	 now	 and	 finds	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">experience	extraordinary.	He	is	frozen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	have	to	move,	he	says	to	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cat	goes	to	the	water’s	edge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	can	swim! </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	the	cat	stops	at	the	water.	It	paces	back	and	forth,	sizing	the	river.	It	shies</p>
<p class="calibre1">away	from	it.	Then	it	sits	and	rages	in	frustration.	Its	teeth	are	formidable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly,	Mathew	stands.	The	cat	stands,	too.	Mathew	backs	into	the	forest	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">walks	 away.	 Behind	 him	 the	 cat	 is	 growling	 and,	 he	 imagines,	 cursing,	 on	 the other	side	of	the	river. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	can’t	cross,	he	tells	himself.	It	can’t	reach	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	he	goes	further	into	the	forest,	he	has	no	idea	how	he’ll	get	water.	Besides, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 river	 offers	 a	 direction.	 The	 forest	 is	 nothing	 but	 confusion,	 and	 he	 might wander	around	in	circles	in	there	for	the	rest	of	his	life.	Even	if	he	doesn’t	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	he’s	going	to	end	up,	having	a	definite	path	forward	is	better	than	standing</p>
<p class="calibre1">still. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	decides	to	carry	on,	trusting	that	the	cat	can’t	cross	the	river	but	conscious</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	of	each	twig	snapping	beneath	his	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stops	when	the	sun	is	starting	to	get	low	and	finds	a	good	tree	with	vines</p>
<p class="calibre1">hanging	down,	like	the	one	he	slept	in	the	night	before.	The	humidity	in	the	air	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">intensifying;	he	can	sense	the	rain	coming.	Gathering	banana	leaves	and	bunches</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 fruit,	 he	 hauls	 the	 lot	 into	 his	 tree.	 He	 has	 time	 to	 gather	 more	 comfortable bedding	and	to	make	the	roof	of	his	tree	house	good	and	waterproof	before	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rain	starts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Safely	 in	 his	 small	 bedroom,	 he	 takes	 off	 his	 shoes	 and	 socks.	 His	 feet	 are white	 and	 wrinkled	 with	 the	 constant	 dampness,	 and	 red	 and	 oozing	 on	 top</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a>where	his	boots	have	rubbed	his	sunburn	raw.	He	dries	the	white	parts	with	some of	 the	 forest	 moss	 he	 managed	 to	 gather	 for	 his	 bed	 but	 daren’t	 touch	 the	 red parts.	He	takes	off	his	top	and	his	trousers	to	dry.	Sweat	clings	to	him.	He	stinks. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I	need	a	bath</i>,	he	thinks.	The	last	thing	passing	through	his	mind	before	he	falls into	a	deep	dreamless	sleep	is	I	hope	the	cat	can’t	climb	trees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Friday,	17	June	2472,	Siberia</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	morning,	life	seems	better.	He	has	slept	in;	he	doesn’t	know	how	long, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	through	the	leaves	he	can	see	the	sun	blazing	high	in	the	sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	gets	down	from	his	tree,	the	cat	is	nowhere	to	be	seen.	A	few	feet</p>
<p class="calibre1">away	 there’s	 a	 bend	 in	 the	 river	 where	 the	 water	 filters	 off	 and	 slows	 into	 a shallow	pool.	Wading	in,	he	washes	himself	and	his	clothes	and	hangs	them	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">sticks	to	dry	in	the	sun	while	he	eats	his	breakfast.	A	sunny	rock	provides	a	place</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	dry	his	sodden	boots	and	he	opens	the	front,	pulling	at	the	laces.	He	tosses	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">banana	skins	into	the	swim	of	the	river. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he	 eats	 he	 tries	 the	 Nexus	 and	 the	 Blackweb	 once	 more,	 booting</p>
<p class="calibre1">Charybdis.	He	thinks	about	Clara	and	wonders	if	she’s	wondering	why	he	hasn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">called.	 He	 thinks	 about	 his	 mother	 and	 what	 she	 must	 have	 thought	 when	 she came	 home	 and	 he	 was	 missing.	 She	 must	 have	 called	 the	 police	 by	 now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	will	search	Mr	Lestrange’s	house,	and	they	will	find	him.	But	then	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">realises,	 although	 he’s	 in	 Lestrange’s	 house,	 he’s	 in	 a	 game	 and	 time	 passes differently	 in	 games.	 Perhaps	 in	 the	 game,	 his	 mother	 still	 hasn’t	 come	 home from	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 wants	 something	 other	 than	 bananas	 now,	 fairly	 badly.	 Wondering	 what</p>
<p class="calibre1">else	in	the	forest	is	edible,	he	packs	moss	on	the	top	of	his	wounded	feet	in	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">socks	and	boots	and	laces	them,	wincing	as	he	tightens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Less	and	less	focused	on	finding	the	door	back	to	reality,	more	focused	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cat,	he	carries	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	senses	it.	He’s	sure	it’s	nearby,	on	the	other	side	of	the	thin	strip	of	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 mind	 cycles	 feverishly	 through	 ways	 to	 get	 away	 from	 it	 –	 climbing	 trees, running	further	into	the	forest.	Occasionally,	as	he	walks	along,	he	comes	across</p>
<p class="calibre1">felled	 trees,	 their	 thick	 trunks	 lying	 across	 his	 path,	 so	 he	 has	 to	 clamber	 over them.	It	crosses	his	mind	that	if	he	rolls	one	of	the	smaller	trees	into	the	water, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 might	 ride	 on	 it	 like	 a	 boat	 down	 the	 river	 and	 away	 from	 the	 cat.	 He	 casts around	for	the	right	kind	of	tree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hours	later,	he	thinks	he’s	found	one.	It’s	a	little	way	from	the	water’s	edge, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 he	 guesses	 it	 won’t	 be	 too	 hard	 to	 drag	 it.	 He	 wedges	 his	 stick	 under	 it,	 to help	dislodge	it	from	the	undergrowth.	It	takes	the	next	couple	of	hours	to	snap</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>off	 twigs	 and	 branches.	 His	 hands	 are	 cut	 and	 sore	 when	 he	 stops	 to	 wash	 and drink	in	the	late	afternoon.	He	glances	at	the	sky.	The	big	low	moon	is	still	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">companion,	 but	 it’s	 obscured	 by	 gathering	 clouds,	 and	 he	 realises	 he	 needs	 to prepare	for	the	night.	Hunting	about,	he	finds	a	tree	to	climb	and	banana	leaves, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 no	 bananas,	 which	 unnerves	 him.	 Up	 in	 his	 tree,	 wedged	 between	 thick branches	 at	 the	 top	 of	 the	 bowl,	 unable	 to	 lie	 down,	 he	 listens	 to	 the	 night	 and falls	asleep	hungry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Saturday,	18	June	2472,	Siberia</p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	wakes,	he	lies	for	a	few	minutes	wondering	how	many	hours	in	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">real	 life	 amount	 to	 hours	 in	 this	 virtual	 world.	 He’s	 trying	 to	 work	 out	 if	 his hunger	is	real-world	hunger	or	if,	as	is	often	the	case	in	these	games,	he	has	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	playing	a	few	hours	and	his	rumbling	stomach	is	a	trick	of	the	VR. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	 he’s	 sleeping	 as	 long	 as	 his	 body	 needs,	 distrusting	 the	 sunlight.	 The nights	seem	very	short. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sitting	in	his	treehouse,	he	examines	his	hands,	arms,	and	feet.	They’re	sore, </p>
<p class="calibre1">really	painful.	It’s	a	remarkable	simulation.	It’s	reassuring	that,	back	in	real	life, Mr	Lestrange	is	sure	to	discover	him	in	his	Darkroom	soon	and	end	the	game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	climbs	down;	the	tree	trunk	boat	is	where	he	left	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	goes	down	to	the	river	to	drink,	he	scans	for	the	cat	and	concludes</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s	moved	on,	at	least	for	now.	He’s	torn	about	whether	he	should	keep	walking</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	leave	the	tree	trunk	boat	where	it	is	or	finish	it	and	make	his	escape	while	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">can. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hunger	drives	him	further	into	the	forest	in	search	of	breakfast,	and	he	finds</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	 banana	 tree.	 After	 he’s	 eaten,	 he	 loads	 a	 bark	 rope	 with	 bananas	 and hangs	it	over	his	shoulder.	On	his	hunt	he	finds	berries,	nuts,	and	fungus	but	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	 idea	 what	 is	 edible	 and	 what	 is	 poisonous,	 so	 he	 daren’t	 eat	 them.	 After breakfast,	 he	 becomes	 preoccupied	 by	 the	 idea	 that	 there	 might	 be	 fish	 in	 the river.	Some	of	the	rivers	on	the	Elgol	estate	have	been	repopulated	with	salmon</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	trout.	This	place	is	wild	enough	not	to	have	been	overfished.	Indeed,	as	it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	a	game,	and	the	forest	is	crawling	with	life,	it	follows	that	the	river	would	be full	of	fish.	Perhaps	he	could	fashion	a	fishing	rod	from	a	sapling	and	use	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	abundant	forest	insects	as	bait.	But	he	lacks	the	skill	to	build	a	fire	in	this damp	place	and,	even	if	he	caught	something,	the	thought	of	raw	fish	makes	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">stomach	churn.	His	grandmother	would	be	ashamed	of	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 he	 gets	 killed	 in	 the	 game,	 he	 imagines,	 as	 in	 all	 games	 he’ll	 be	 ejected, back	 into	 cold,	 hard	 reality	 –	 or	 in	 this	 particular	 case,	 gentle,	 safe	 reality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps,	 then,	 he	 should	 get	 himself	 killed.	 Incredible	 as	 this	 world	 is,	 it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>frustrating	and	he’s	growing	tired	of	it.	With	that	thought	in	his	mind,	he	heads back	to	his	tree	trunk	boat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having	 loosened	 the	 trunk	 some	 more	 with	 his	 walking	 stick,	 he	 makes	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">long	 rope	 with	 the	 bark	 strips,	 ties	 it	 around	 one	 end	 of	 the	 tree	 and	 pulls, stopping	periodically	to	clear	the	route	of	stones,	branches,	and	plants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	forty	minutes	of	hard	work,	he	manages	to	drag	the	trunk	to	the	edge	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 riverbank	 and	 pushes	 it	 in	 with	 a	 great	 splash,	 then	 jumps	 in	 after	 it,	 just managing	to	catch	hold	of	the	slippery	bark	as	the	trunk	is	turned	and	grabbed	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	river. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	catches	the	flow	and	starts	to	travel	down	sideways.	Mathew	gets	behind	it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">throws	 his	 arms	 and	 his	 chest	 over	 the	 top,	 hauls	 himself	 up	 and	 hugs	 the	 wet wood	to	him,	in	the	still	fast	centre	of	the	river	now.	The	riverbed	is	far	from	the reach	 of	 his	 feet.	 The	 force	 of	 the	 water	 pushes	 him	 and	 the	 tree	 on,	 and	 they gather	 momentum.	 Then,	 as	 the	 river	 bends,	 it	 suddenly	 narrows,	 and	 the	 tree gets	jammed	between	the	bank	and	a	rock.	He	hauls	himself	along	the	trunk,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">current	rushing	beneath	him,	dragging	at	his	legs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 it’s	 shallow	 enough	 for	 him	 to	 touch	 the	 rocky	 river	 bottom	 with	 his feet,	he	stands	and	pushes	at	the	wedged	tree.	It	won’t	move.	In	front	of	the	tree, </p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 bank,	 branches	 and	 other	 debris	 have	 got	 tangled	 against	 a	 jutting	 rock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	tree	is	caught	on	this	mess.	Reaching	across	the	trunk,	he	manages	to	clear</p>
<p class="calibre1">away	 the	 debris	 and	 push	 the	 front	 of	 the	 log	 to	 face	 down	 the	 river.	 Taking	 a firm	 hold	 as	 the	 log-boat	 starts	 to	 move	 again,	 he	 uses	 the	 momentum	 to	 drag himself	 chest-first	 along	 the	 top.	 Lying	 face-down,	 he	 precariously	 manages	 to balance	and	he	thinks	that	when	he	stops	again,	he’ll	try	to	find	two	smaller	logs</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	tie	to	the	trunk	with	bark	rope,	to	form	a	raft. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	river	widens	and	deepens	again,	and	he	hangs	on	harder	still	as	the	force</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 water	 gathers,	 but	 he	 feels	 more	 vulnerable	 and	 wonders	 how	 he	 might turn	the	trunk	so	he’s	behind	it	again.	He	slips	off	and	gradually	edges	it	around</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	water,	pushing	against	the	current. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Staring	ahead	to	where	the	river	narrows,	he	spots	a	large	stony	beach	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">right-hand	 side.	 The	 water	 becomes	 shallower,	 his	 feet	 bang	 and	 drag	 on	 the riverbed,	and	he	lifts	his	legs.	Near	the	beach,	the	water	gets	shallower	still,	the tree	gets	stuck,	and	he	wades	around	to	push	it	free. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	large	and	powerful	hits	him	from	the	side,	throwing	him	onto	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s	so	dazed,	it	takes	him	a	moment	to	realise	it’s	the	cat.	He	scrambles	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	feet	–	there’s	a	searing	pain	in	his	shoulder,	but	no	time	to	think.	The	cat	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">between	him	and	the	river.	He	tries	to	move	further	along	the	beach	nearer	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>water,	 but	 the	 cat	 has	 him	 covered	 and	 cuts	 him	 off.	 Slowly,	 he	 backs	 towards the	forest,	all	the	time	expecting	the	creature	to	pounce.	He	somehow	scrambles</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	 a	 bank,	 gripping	 roots,	 grass,	 plant	 stems	 –	 anything.	 There’s	 a	 vine hanging	by	his	face	–	he	grips	it	and	pulls,	testing	it,	and	quickly	gets	a	foothold and	 swings	 towards	 the	 trunk	 of	 a	 tree,	 throwing	 his	 leg	 and	 catching	 it	 on	 a branch,	 levering	 himself	 with	 his	 arms	 and	 his	 wounded	 foot.	 The	 cat	 comes bounding	 up	 the	 bank.	 Mathew	 gets	 clear	 just	 as	 the	 cat	 launches	 itself	 at	 the tree,	 leaving	 a	 great	 gash	 mark	 in	 the	 side	 of	 the	 bark.	 Struggling	 crazily, Mathew	 kicks	 and	 scrambles	 and	 climbs	 desperately,	 until	 he’s	 sitting	 on	 a sturdy	branch.	The	cat	makes	one	more	attempt	to	get	at	him,	leaping	and	falling</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	a	crash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	long	time	it	sits	at	the	base	of	the	tree,	roaring	at	him	whenever	he	peers</p>
<p class="calibre1">down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 starts	 to	 rain.	 The	 branch	 becomes	 slippy,	 and	 he	 retreats	 slowly	 to	 the heart	of	the	tree.	His	shoulder	is	numb	with	pain.	Touching	it	with	his	hand,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">finds	 that	 it’s	 wet	 and	 sticky.	 When	 he	 looks	 at	 his	 fingers,	 they’re	 covered	 in blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thunder	 shakes	 the	 tree,	 and	 then	 rain	 is	 beating	 down	 all	 around	 him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">bouncing	off	the	shiny	leaves.	He	notices	a	bank	of	moss	growing	on	the	side	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 thick	 branch,	 scrapes	 off	 a	 handful	 and	 holds	 it	 in	 the	 rain	 until	 it’s	 sodden, then	presses	it	against	his	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	finds	a	way	to	lie	down	securely	without	danger	of	falling	from	the	tree</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 rests	 there	 miserably,	 the	 rain	 pounding	 down,	 relentless.	 When	 it	 finally stops,	he	cranes	his	neck	over	the	side	of	his	refuge.	The	cat	has	gone,	but	night</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	closing	in,	and	he’s	too	tired	to	go	down	and	gather	things	to	make	a	decent</p>
<p class="calibre1">bed.	He	sleeps	fitfully	where	he	is,	his	shoulder	throbbing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sunday,	19	June	2472,	Siberia</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	morning,	there’s	no	sign	of	the	cat.	He	lets	himself	down	and	goes	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	river	to	drink.	His	arm	aches.	At	the	water’s	edge	he	takes	off	his	shirt	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">examines	his	shoulder.	There’s	a	large	gash,	red	and	gaping.	He	cleans	it	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">river,	then	gathers	some	more	moss,	and	tears	a	strip	off	his	shirt	to	bind	the	wet</p>
<p class="calibre1">moss	 to	 his	 wound.	 His	 shirt	 is	 now	 in	 tatters.	 He	 considers	 putting	 it	 back	 on and	 then	 ties	 it	 around	 his	 head	 to	 keep	 off	 the	 sun	 and	 catch	 the	 sweat	 that constantly	drips	down	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 spends	 a	 long	 time	 searching	 for	 food	 in	 the	 forest,	 distracted	 by	 the wound	inflicted	by	the	cat.	The	day	before,	he	left	his	walking	pole	on	the	bank</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	river	and	moving	in	the	undergrowth	is	harder	without	it.	Hunting	around, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>he	finds	another	buried	in	a	tangle	of	sticky	clinging	vines	and	low	broad-leafed growth.	 As	 he	 pulls	 it	 carefully	 from	 the	 leaves,	 he	 thinks	 about	 snakes	 and spiders.	This	new	stick	is	a	better	one.	He	sizes	it,	balancing	it	in	his	good	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 other	 arm	 is	 throbbing,	 and	 his	 skin	 is	 stained	 with	 his	 own	 blood,	 but	 he tries	to	put	that	from	his	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heading	to	the	river,	he	hears	an	animal	noise,	a	growl,	coming	from	across</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 water,	 but	 it	 isn’t	 close	 enough	 for	 him	 to	 be	 sure	 it’s	 the	 cat.	 He	 scans around	for	a	tree	to	climb,	but	he	is	in	amongst	small	shrubs	and	banana	trees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking	another	route,	he	walks	deeper	in	the	forest	for	a	while,	until	finally	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">turns	again	towards	the	river	and	hears	the	cat,	distinctly	this	time.	He’s	forced	to retreat,	trying	to	stay	parallel	to	the	river	from	a	distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	river	is	his	compass,	and	he	doesn’t	want	to	lose	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 the	 day	 goes	 on	 and	 he	 gets	 thirsty,	 he	 wonders	 how	 he	 can	 find	 clean, fresh	 water.	 Searching	 amongst	 the	 low-growing	 plants,	 he	 finds	 one	 whose</p>
<p class="calibre1">centre	is	full	of	rainwater.	Cautious,	he	tastes	a	small	amount	first,	worried	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">plant	 might	 have	 poisoned	 it,	 but	 the	 water	 is	 sweet	 and	 clean,	 better	 than	 the river	 water.	 When	 he’s	 finished	 drinking,	 he	 examines	 his	 bandage	 and	 thinks about	washing	the	wound	in	the	water,	but	when	he	touches	the	moss,	the	pain	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	bad	he	decides	to	leave	it	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 ground	 is	 becoming	 stony,	 and	 he	 realises	 he’s	 climbing	 and	 getting</p>
<p class="calibre1">further	away	from	the	river.	Straining	his	ears,	he	can	no	longer	hear	the	rushing</p>
<p class="calibre1">sound	of	the	water.	He	clambers	across	a	rocky	outcrop	on	the	side	of	the	hill, </p>
<p class="calibre1">bare	 of	 plants,	 and,	 standing	 on	 a	 boulder,	 takes	 a	 breather	 and	 surveys	 his whereabouts.	Down	below	the	treetops	the	river	gleams	silver	in	the	sunlight.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">sighs	 with	 relief.	 It	 looks	 like	 if	 he	 walks	 down	 at	 a	 diagonal,	 he’ll	 meet	 the river,	so	he	slides	off	the	boulder	and	sets	off	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	are	a	few	taller	trees	to	use	as	landmarks	and	a	rocky	peak	on	the	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">side	of	the	valley	atop	a	flat-sided	cliff	next	to	the	river.	It’s	hot.	The	sun	burns without	the	shade	of	the	forest.	He	arranges	the	hat	he’s	made	with	his	shirt	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">cover	his	neck	and	shoulders.	The	large	moon	in	the	blue	sky	hangs	over	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	moves	on	quickly,	starting	off	with	purpose,	but	he	hasn’t	gone	far	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	hears	a	snapping	of	branches.	The	sound	is	close.	The	cat	is	walking	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	undergrowth	directly	ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	 again	 he	 searches	 frantically	 for	 somewhere	 to	 hide.	 He’s	 surrounded</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	tall	trees,	but	they	have	straight,	smooth	trunks	with	no	low	branches	to	grip</p>
<p class="calibre1">hold	 of.	 Striking	 a	 slightly	 different	 path,	 to	 his	 right,	 along	 the	 contour	 of	 the hillside	 rather	 than	 directly	 down,	 he	 glimpses	 a	 flash	 of	 the	 cat	 between	 the trunks	of	trees.	It	does	not	come	directly	at	him	but	crosses	his	path,	through	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dense	 foliage	 ahead.	 It’s	 gone	 and	 then	 appears	 again,	 some	 way	 down	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a>hillside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	sitting.	Waiting.	It	yawns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	climbs	slightly	higher	and	tries	to	walk	forward	along	the	hillside	again, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	the	cat	is	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is	 it	 playing	 with	 me?	 he	 wonders.	 Cats	 do	 that	 with	 their	 food	 before	 they make	a	kill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	pulse	hammers	away,	but	he	doesn’t	experience	the	rising	panic	he’s	felt</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	 in	 encounters	 with	 the	 cat,	 even	 though,	 this	 time,	 he	 seems	 to	 have nowhere	to	go.	They	continue.	The	cat,	he	realises,	is	pushing	him	higher	up	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mountain.	It’s	herding	him.	They	climb.	There	are	more	and	more	rocks,	fewer</p>
<p class="calibre1">trees	and	shrubs.	A	high	stone	cliff	rises	above	him,	penning	him	in	on	the	cliff</p>
<p class="calibre1">side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is	it	taking	me	to	the	place	it	wants	to	kill	me? </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 is	 a	 game,	 he	 reminds	 himself.	 A	 highly	 realistic,	 rather	 horrifying game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	the	mantra:	This	is	not	real.	I	cannot	die. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	is	at	the	base	of	the	cliff.	The	cat	has	come	from	the	forest.	It’s	standing	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">front	of	him.	As	he	moves	to	go	the	other	way,	fluidly,	free	of	the	least	effort,	it moves	into	his	path.	In	every	physical	way	this	animal	is	superior. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carved	 into	 the	 cliff,	 there’s	 a	 cave.	 Its	 black	 mouth	 gapes	 at	 the	 daylight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cat	is	weaving	backwards	and	forwards	now,	pushing	Mathew	into	the	cave. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">This	is	where	it	brings	its	prey	to	die, </i>	he	thinks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 gunshot	 rings	 pure	 and	 clear,	 the	 sound	 bouncing	 off	 the	 cliff	 side	 and echoing	down	the	canyon.	The	bullet	was	aimed	at	the	cat.	It	misses	and	takes</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	 a	 tree	 instead,	 which	 cracks	 and	 breaks	 and	 falls.	 The	 cat	 is	 gone	 in	 the blink	of	an	eye.	Air	shudders	in	Mathew’s	lungs.	He	breathes	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	is	saved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	are	men	coming	towards	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">19	Dragomirov</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Стой!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 human	 voice.	 A	 foreign	 language	 but	 a	 human	 voice.	 Mathew	 doesn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand	the	words,	but	they	have	the	international	sound	of	a	command.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">game	clearly	doesn’t	allow	ordinary	Nexus	simultaneous	translation.	The	sound</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	people	approaching.	Rocks	disturbed,	branches	broken.	Conversation.	There’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	 urgency	 and	 aggression	 to	 the	 exchanges	 that	 make	 Mathew	 think	 these</p>
<p class="calibre1">people	are	not	out	on	a	Sunday	stroll.	The	language	is	familiar,	though.	It	sounds</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	Eva.	It	sounds	like	Russian. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	break	through	the	trees	and	start	climbing	the	rocky	slope	towards	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Four	 soldiers	 in	 jungle	 camouflage	 carrying	 strange-looking	 guns.	 Two	 of	 the soldiers	have	their	crosshairs	trained	on	him	as	they	approach.	Slowly,	Mathew</p>
<p class="calibre1">puts	down	his	walking	stick	and	puts	his	hands	in	the	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Как	тебя	зовут?	Oткуда	вы?	Вы	понимаете	меня?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	who	has	spoken	to	him,	and	who	appears	to	be	in	charge,	indicates</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	others	to	lower	their	weapons.	Mathew	feels	only	marginally	safer	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Говорить!”	 snaps	 the	 man	 in	 charge.	 He	 has	 a	 blond	 crew	 cut,	 a	 two-day beard	 and	 the	 distinctive	 deep-set	 eyes	 of	 Russian	 people;	 he’s	 glistening	 with sweat,	dark	patches	under	his	arms	and	across	his	chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	understand,”	Mathew	says.	“I	don’t	speak	Russian.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 smiles,	 clearly	 pleased,	 like	 he	 has	 found	 something	 he	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">searching	for,	like	he	has	struck	gold.	He	looks	around	at	the	other	soldiers,	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">grin	 back	 at	 him,	 and	 then	 says	 to	 Mathew	 in	 heavily	 accented	 English,	 “You come	with	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 walk	 for	 an	 hour	 at	 a	 military	 clip	 Mathew	 barely	 keeps	 pace	 with, down	to	the	river	and	along	the	bank	until	they	reach	a	broad	rocky	shore,	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 one	 where	 the	 cat	 pounced	 on	 him.	 At	 the	 edge,	 on	 the	 river-smoothed stones,	 is	 a	 camp	 in	 a	 cleared	 area.	 There	 are	 shelters,	 tarpaulins	 stretched between	 posts,	 hammocks,	 equipment	 and	 supplies	 hanging	 from	 the	 beams	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	shelters,	a	fire	tended	by	another	solider,	the	smell	of	food. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	thirstily	drinks	clean,	fresh	water	from	a	beaker	offered	to	him	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">crew-cut	Russian	who	refills	it	for	him	from	a	hanging	barrel	fed	from	a	water</p>
<p class="calibre1">filter.	 He	 indicates	 to	 a	 makeshift	 bench	 made	 from	 forest	 wood.	 Mathew	 sits down.	 Crew-cut	 shouts	 at	 the	 man	 tending	 the	 fire.	 The	 man	 is	 fat,	 with	 curly greying	black	hair,	the	bulbous	nose	of	a	heavy	drinker,	a	red	face,	and	smiling</p>
<p class="calibre1">dark	eyes.	He	brings	something	to	Mathew	–	a	metal	bowl,	a	spoon,	food,	some</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a>kind	of	stew.	It	smells	amazing.	Mathew	delves	in	ravenously,	unquestioning.	It is	food.	It	is	hot.	Crew-cut	smiles	at	him	indulgently,	is	patient,	lets	him	eat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	fat	man	watches	him	eat,	too.	“I	am	Evgeny,	Evgeny	Shukshin,”	he	says, </p>
<p class="calibre1">touching	his	fingers	to	his	chest.	“Who	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mathew,”	 he	 says	 between	 mouthfuls,	 spooning	 the	 last	 bits	 of	 gravy	 into his	mouth.	“You	speak	English?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Little	 bit,”	 the	 cook	 says,	 grinning.	 “I	 wish	 more.”	 The	 cook	 notices	 his shoulder.	“You	are	hurting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Trying	 to	 escape	 the	 cat,	 meeting	 the	 Russians,	 Mathew	 has	 forgotten	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulder,	 which	 has	 started	 to	 bleed	 again.	 The	 shirt	 and	 moss	 bandage	 are hanging	off	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hurt	my	arm.	And	my	feet.”	He	puts	the	bowl	on	the	floor,	bends	down	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">loosens	the	laces	of	his	boots,	slowly	drawing	out	his	feet,	removing	his	filthy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sodden,	 blood-stained	 socks	 and	 picking	 off	 the	 wad	 of	 moss	 covering	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">weeping	skin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 cooks	 says	 something	 to	 crew-cut,	 who	 calls	 to	 another	 soldier	 who’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">hanging	water	carriers	on	one	of	the	tent	poles.	A	young	man	with	a	shaven	head</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 a	 missing	 front	 tooth	 comes	 and	 takes	 hold	 of	 Mathew’s	 arm.	 He	 flinches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gap-tooth	says	something	to	Evgeny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evgeny	says,	“It’s	okay.	He	will	help	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	nods	and	turns	to	the	soldier,	who’s	looking	at	him	expectantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gap-tooth	unwinds	the	remains	of	the	makeshift	bandage	and	picks	away	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">moss.	Mathew	turns	away	and	grits	his	teeth.	The	soldier	whistles,	goes	to	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 hanging	 bags	 and	 comes	 back	 with	 a	 medical	 kit.	 Rummaging	 inside,	 he pulls	out	a	tub,	removes	the	top,	and	squeezes	a	transparent	cream	directly	onto</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	wound.	Then	he	sets	to	work	pulling	the	wound	together	and	binding	the	skin</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 adhesive	 strips.	 He	 wraps	 the	 whole	 thing	 in	 a	 clean	 bandage	 and	 then	 a waterproof	dressing;	he	then	turns	his	attention	to	Mathew’s	damaged	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,”	Mathew	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cпасибо,”	Evgeny	says	to	Mathew.	“It’s	thank	you	in	Russian.	Spaz	iba.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Spaziba,”	he	repeats	back	to	Evgeny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 soldier	 grins	 and	 says	 something.	 Evgeny	 translates.	 “He	 says	 you’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">welcome.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another,	older	man	holding	a	telephone	receiver	attached	to	a	box	speaks	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">crew-cut,	who	gets	up,	takes	the	receiver,	and	starts	speaking	into	the	receiver	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Russian,	looking	at	Mathew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cook	stays	with	him,	offering	him	more	food	and	water.	No	one	points	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>gun	at	him	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	he	has	eaten,	Evgeny	gives	him	soap	and	nods	at	the	river.	“You	smell</p>
<p class="calibre1">bad.	Get	clean.”	He	mimes	scrubbing	himself	and	washing	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 gratefully	 goes	 down	 to	 the	 water’s	 edge,	 strips	 down	 to	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">underwear,	then	looks	around,	shrugs	and	takes	them	off	as	well.	Wading	thigh-</p>
<p class="calibre1">deep,	he	scrubs	himself	with	the	soap	and	a	cloth,	scouring	off	days	of	grime	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sweat.	The	soap	pools	around	him	and	forms	a	line	as	it’s	slowly	taken	down	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">river.	 When	 he	 comes	 into	 shore,	 Evgeny	 offers	 him	 a	 towel	 and	 fresh,	 dry clothes,	jungle	camouflage	like	theirs,	too	big	for	him.	He	rolls	up	the	legs	of	the trousers	 and	 his	 sleeves	 and	 ties	 the	 waist	 with	 some	 rope	 Evgeny	 gives	 him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evgeny	also	finds	him	fresh	clean,	dry	socks,	and	Mathew	is	more	grateful	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	has	felt	in	a	long	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evgeny	 puts	 out	 his	 shoes	 to	 dry.	 Mathew	 expects	 them	 to	 throw	 his	 old</p>
<p class="calibre1">clothes	 on	 the	 fire,	 but	 crew-cut	 washes	 them,	 dries	 them	 in	 the	 sun,	 and	 then puts	them	in	a	bag	like	they	are	evidence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 afternoon,	 in	 his	 fresh-smelling,	 clean	 clothes,	 no	 longer	 hungry	 or thirsty,	he	watches	the	soldiers	fish	in	the	river.	They	score	a	fine	dinner,	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	slowly	smoke	above	the	fire	on	greenwood	sticks.	The	light	starts	to	fade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 they	 sit	 around	 the	 fire,	 waiting	 for	 the	 fish	 to	 cook,	 Evgeny	 teaches Mathew	all	the	soldiers’	names	in	turn.	The	gap-toothed	man,	cleaner	and	fixer</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 his	 wounds,	 is	 Abram	 Salko.	 There’s	 a	 grim-faced	 man	 with	 a	 well-bushed low	brow	and	a	half-day	beard,	hunched	by	the	fire	carving	wood	with	a	survival</p>
<p class="calibre1">knife.	His	name	is	Vladimir	Klokov.	The	soldier	who	handed	crew-cut	the	phone</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 older,	 small,	 wiry,	 with	 greying	 hair	 and	 a	 lined,	 sad	 face,	 but	 he	 smiles	 at Mathew.	His	name	is	Yakov	Zarubin.	There’s	a	good-looking	blond	boy,	trying</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 grow	 a	 moustache,	 called	 Pavel	 Folkin,	 who	 stands	 and	 tests	 one	 of	 the cooking	fish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Andrei	.	.	.”	Evgeny	says,	pointing	to	crew-cut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crew-cut	 says	 something	 sharply	 to	 Evgeny.	 “His	 name	 is	 Kapral	 Churkin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Churkin,	not	Andrei.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	wants	to	be	known	by	his	last	name?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	Only	rank	and	last	names	here,	he	says.	But	I	am	Evgeny.	I	have	son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your	age.	Far	away.	You	understand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	nods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later,	 as	 the	 fire	 crackles,	 some	 alcoholic	 liquid	 is	 passed	 around.	 Mathew takes	 a	 sip.	 It	 is	 strong	 and	 makes	 him	 cough.	 The	 soldiers	 laugh,	 but	 not unkindly.	He’s	a	boy,	after	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	string	a	hammock	for	him	under	a	mosquito	net. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyes	grow	heavy	watching	the	embers	glow	in	the	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>Monday,	20	June	2472,	Siberia</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 morning,	 there	 is	 more	 fresh	 water	 and	 food:	 a	 kind	 of	 porridge	 with something	 sweet	 in	 it.	 Churkin	 the	 crew-cut	 is	 on	 the	 strange	 old	 phone	 again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 soldiers	 get	 busy	 packing	 camp.	 The	 camp	 is	 put	 away	 in	 bags	 and	 boxes with	military	efficiency.	It’s	all	stacked	neatly	on	the	stony	shore.	Then	they	sit</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	wait.	Salko	gap-tooth	and	Folkin	the	boy	wrestle	to	pass	the	time.	Others	sit</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	and	yell	abuse	or	encouragement;	it’s	difficult	for	Mathew	to	tell	which. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 Zarubin	 shouts	 and	 points.	 A	 boat	 is	 coming	 along	 the	 river.	 It’s	 a military	 vehicle,	 wide	 and	 flat-bottomed,	 big	 enough	 to	 carry	 Churkin’s	 small outfit	and	all	their	stuff,	pushed	along	by	a	powerful	engine.	It	is	also	sheltered, with	a	canvas	canopy,	a	necessity	in	the	climate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	 they’ve	 loaded	 and	 pushed	 off,	 Mathew	 sits	 at	 the	 front	 watching</p>
<p class="calibre1">Evgeny	preparing	lunch	for	the	others	while	they	travel.	Evgeny	hands	him	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">cans	and	a	can	opener. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here,”	he	starts	one	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	nods,	“I	know.”	He	has	done	this	in	an	old	game	loosely	based	on	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">twentieth-century	 war.	 As	 he	 opens	 the	 cans,	 he	 passes	 them	 to	 Evgeny,	 who’s spreading	paste	onto	biscuits,	which	he	puts	in	metal	bowls	and	hands	round	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">men.	 Klokov	 takes	 a	 bite	 and	 spits	 his	 mouthful	 over	 the	 side	 of	 the	 boat, complaining	 loudly	 at	 Evgeny.	 Evgeny	 says	 something	 back	 to	 the	 man,	 who</p>
<p class="calibre1">takes	offence	and	stands.	Churkin	yells	at	him,	and	he	sits	down,	reluctantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evgeny	glances	at	Mathew	and	grunts.	“Hard	ass,”	he	says,	meaning	Klokov. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 grins,	 eating	 his	 biscuits	 happily,	 still	 grateful	 for	 anything	 not banana. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	are	we	going?”	Mathew	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Home,”	Evgeny	says.	Then	he	thinks.	“No.	Not	home.	Base	camp.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	are	we?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	shakes	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	did	you	get	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	shrugs.	How	to	explain? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	better	have	story	when	get	to	base	camp.	You	better	have	good	story.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dragomirov.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Churkin	 bawls	 something	 at	 Evgeny,	 who	 replies	 deferentially	 and	 turns	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">deal	with	the	empty	tins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	how	do	I	compose	a	good	story	if	I	don’t	know	where	I	am?”	Mathew</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>says	to	Evgeny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evgeny	puts	his	finger	to	his	lips	and	indicates	Churkin	watching	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 journey,	 Evgeny	 won’t	 do	 more	 than	 grunt	 at	 Mathew, passing	 him	 water	 and	 food,	 but	 speaking	 loudly	 only	 in	 Russian,	 glancing	 all the	time	at	Churkin	like	a	dog	waiting	to	be	kicked	by	its	master. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	they	round	a	bend,	on	a	wide	stretch	of	water,	a	clearing,	a	small	village, </p>
<p class="calibre1">comes	 into	 view,	 smoke	 billowing	 from	 fires	 and	 chimneys	 in	 thatched-roof</p>
<p class="calibre1">wooden	 houses.	 People	 working	 on	 the	 bank	 spot	 the	 boat	 and	 start	 to	 call. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Others	gather	on	the	wooden	jetty,	where	a	number	of	other	boats	are	secured.	In</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 boat,	 Churkin	 starts	 giving	 orders.	 Klokov	 and	 Folkin	 come	 to	 where</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	is	sitting.	They	pull	him	to	his	feet	and	roughly	turn	him	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Metal	 circles	 his	 wrists.	 He’s	 being	 handcuffed.	 They	 stand	 with	 him	 at	 the front	of	the	boat	as	it	draws	in	to	shore.	Zarubin	hops	onto	the	bow,	carrying	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">rope.	He	jumps	onto	the	jetty,	pulls	them	in	with	the	rope,	and	ties	it	fast.	Klokov and	 Folkin	 push	 Mathew	 forward.	 He	 nearly	 slips	 and	 falls	 without	 arms	 to balance.	 Klokov	 holds	 him	 up	 and	 all	 but	 lifts	 him	 onto	 the	 jetty.	 They	 wait while	Churkin	gets	off.	Evgeny	comes	ashore	carrying	a	case	of	food.	Bending</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 put	 the	 case	 on	 the	 floor	 near	 Mathew,	 he	 whispers	 as	 he	 stands,	 “We’re	 in Chukotka.	We’re	in	Siberia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Klokov	gives	the	cook	a	shove,	says	something,	and	Evgeny	goes	back	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	boat	to	continue	to	unload.	Churkin	arrives,	and	they	start	to	walk	along	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">jetty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 they	 go	 into	 the	 village,	 people	 stop	 and	 peer	 from	 their	 work.	 All	 the people	here	are	men,	and	they’re	all	in	uniform. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 base	 camp	 is	 in	 a	 clearing	 in	 the	 jungle.	 They	 walk	 along	 a	 makeshift runway	with	a	windsock	at	the	end	of	a	tall	pole	and	a	helipad.	There’s	a	large, </p>
<p class="calibre1">open-sided	 building	 with	 benches	 in	 it	 and	 a	 number	 of	 wooden	 huts	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">banana-leaf	thatches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 is	 taken	 to	 one	 of	 these	 smaller	 huts	 and	 hustled	 through	 the	 door, boots	loud	on	the	raised	wooden	floor.	There’s	a	short	corridor	with	a	chair	in	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	two	rooms	with	their	doors	open.	Klokov	shoves	Mathew	inside	the	second</p>
<p class="calibre1">room,	shuts	the	door	and	locks	it	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	nothing	in	the	room	but	a	low	wooden	bed	pushed	against	a	wall.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">walls	are	lime-washed	mud	and	straw.	The	floor	is	wooden,	dry	and	clean.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">room	 is	 spotless.	 There’s	 one	 narrow	 window	 letting	 in	 bright	 sunlight,	 but	 it’s too	high	up	to	see	out	of.	It’s	cool	in	the	room,	and	Mathew	is	cold.	He	hasn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt	cold	in	days.	He	grabs	the	thin	blanket	off	the	bed	and	wraps	it	around	his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	there	is	nothing	to	do	but	sit	and	wait. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	uses	the	time	to	think	of	a	story,	like	Evgeny	told	him.	Why	would	he	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	Siberia? </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	is	the	strangest	game	I	have	ever	played.	Siberia	isn’t	anything	like	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	saw	on	the	news	only	a	few	months	ago	that	it’s	uninhabitable	because	of	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 methane	 from	 the	 melting	 permafrost.	 But	 this	 is	 a	 game,	 and	 the	 game requires	me	to	invent	a	story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thinking	hard,	he	starts	to	invent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 door	 unlocks,	 a	 man	 comes	 in,	 and	 the	 door	 locks	 behind	 him.	 He	 is balding,	with	a	salt-and-pepper	moustache,	and	wears	a	uniform	with	a	red	cross</p>
<p class="calibre1">sewn	on	his	sleeve.	He	is	carrying	a	medical	bag,	which	he	puts	on	the	floor	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">opens.	Without	comment	or	introduction,	he	gets	straight	to	business.	Brusquely</p>
<p class="calibre1">gripping	 Mathew’s	 arm,	 he	 examines	 the	 wound.	 He	 pours	 liquid	 onto	 some</p>
<p class="calibre1">cotton	 wool,	 and	 Mathew	 gasps	 and	 flinches	 as	 the	 doctor	 swabs	 the	 weeping skin.	 The	 man	 grips	 his	 shoulder	 more	 tightly	 and	 holds	 it	 in	 place	 as	 he continues	to	work,	using	a	device	unfamiliar	to	Mathew	to	stitch	the	wound,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">redresses	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	 he	 has	 finished	 with	 Mathew’s	 injuries,	 the	 doctor	 takes	 an	 electrical device	 from	 the	 bag	 on	 the	 floor.	 Pushing	 Mathew’s	 head	 forward,	 he	 runs	 the device	across	the	skin	at	the	back	of	his	neck.	There	is	a	beep.	The	man	stands</p>
<p class="calibre1">back,	 punches	 keys	 on	 the	 device,	 reads	 something,	 looks	 at	 Mathew</p>
<p class="calibre1">suspiciously,	 and	 then	 peers	 at	 the	 device	 again,	 punching	 some	 more	 buttons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 machine	 beeps	 again.	 He	 repeats	 the	 exercise,	 pushing	 Mathew’s	 head</p>
<p class="calibre1">down,	frowning	at	the	screen,	displeased.	Doing	the	whole	thing	one	more	time</p>
<p class="calibre1">makes	him	no	happier.	Standing	and	stepping	quickly	across	the	room,	he	briskly</p>
<p class="calibre1">bangs	on	the	door.	The	door	is	unlocked,	and	the	doctor	leaves.	Mathew	is	alone</p>
<p class="calibre1">again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Much	 later,	 the	 light	 from	 the	 high	 window	 is	 still	 bright.	 The	 guard	 comes into	 the	 room	 and	 places	 a	 chair	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 empty	 floor,	 a	 few	 feet away	from	the	bed,	and	leaves	the	room	without	having	once	looked	at	Mathew, </p>
<p class="calibre1">slamming	the	bolt	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several	minutes	pass	before	the	door	opens	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	new	man	comes	into	the	room	and	sits	down	on	the	chair,	facing	Mathew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Short	in	stature,	he	is	slight,	not	muscular,	but	something	in	his	body	language</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>carries	such	aggression	and	malice	that	Mathew	is	immediately	on	his	guard.	He has	a	thick	mat	of	dark	hair,	the	type	that	forms	into	springy	curls	if	it	isn’t	kept short,	 small	 black	 angry	 eyes,	 and	 an	 expression	 of	 utter	 contempt.	 Leaning forward,	 his	 elbows	 on	 his	 knees,	 he	 assesses	 his	 prisoner	 like	 a	 spider contemplating	 breakfast,	 finally	 saying	 in	 accentless	 English,	 “So,	 you	 are Mathew	Erlang?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	Mathew	croaks.	His	throat	is	terribly	dry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	Polkovnik	Grigory	Dragomirov.	Colonel	Dragomirov.”	The	man’s	eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	hard,	unblinking.	“You	don’t	speak	a	word	of	Russian?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	without	a	simultaneous	translation	plug-in	to	my	e-Pin,	no.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	don’t	use	simultaneous	translation	devices	here,”	the	man	says,	leaning</p>
<p class="calibre1">back,	 getting	 comfortable.	 “Firstly,	 they	 tend	 to	 break	 easily	 because	 of	 the extreme	 humidity.	 Secondly,	 we	 don’t	 need	 them,	 because	 we	 all	 speak</p>
<p class="calibre1">Russian.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov	 sits	 back	 in	 his	 chair,	 stretching	 his	 neck,	 gazing	 at	 the	 ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	closes	his	eyes	and	sighs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	would	an	English	or	Japanese	boy	.	.	.	what	are	you	again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	English.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	surprised	you	didn’t	try	to	say	you	were	Chinese,	which	would	at	least</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	 some	 sense.	 So	 why	 would	 a	 boy	 with	 English	 credentials	 be	 wandering around	in	the	jungle	in	northeast	Siberia?”	He	seems	to	be	genuinely	engaged	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">puzzling	this	out,	trying	to	glean	the	answer	from	the	ceiling.	Then	he	drops	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">head	and	stares	directly	at	Mathew.	“Do	you	know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	–	I	am	–	travelling	with	my	father.	He’s	a	research	scientist.”	Mathew</p>
<p class="calibre1">hears	the	question	in	his	tone.	It	doesn’t	sound	convincing	even	to	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	smiles	indulgently.	“And	where	is	your	father	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	got	separated.	I	got	lost.	I	fell	into	the	river	and	got	swept	downstream.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	trying	to	find	him,	when	a	big	cat	attacked	me.	Your	soldiers	saved	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	 How	 nice	 of	 them.”	 He	 smiles,	 waits	 for	 Mathew	 to	 smile,	 and	 then hardens	 his	 face.	 “So	 if	 we	 all	 go	 back	 upstream	 and	 hunt,	 we	 will	 find	 an English	scientist	working	in	the	jungle,	presumably	now	searching	for	his	son?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does	he	have	a	permit	to	do	research	in	the	jungle?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	.	.	.	I	don’t	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	shakes	his	head.	The	man	sighs	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	odd.	We	have	no	record	of	any	English	scientist	working	here.	Nor	does</p>
<p class="calibre1">anyone	in	the	Federation	government.	It’s	strange,	given	there	is	a	war	on.	Why</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 an	 English	 research	 scientist	 be	 working	 in	 Russia	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>war?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	war!	He’d	forgotten	the	war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	do	you	know	what	is	even	more	puzzling?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	blinks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	know?”	He	wants	a	response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	Mathew	croaks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	father	is	dead,”	the	man	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	do	they	know?	Did	they	get	it	from	his	chip? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 that	 is	 still	 not	 the	 strangest	 thing	 of	 all.	 The	 strangest	 thing	 is	 .	 .	 .”	 –</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov	is	leaning	forward	again	–	“you	have	been	dead	for	381	years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">20	Mathew	Erlang	is	Dead</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean	I’m	dead?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Major	Lapin,	the	doctor	who	came	to	examine	you	before,	scanned	you	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	chip	reader.	It	found	your	bioID.	We	have	international	records	–	they’re	easy</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough	to	get.	It	says	you	are	who	you	claim	to	be.	You	are	Mathew	Erlang.	You</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	born	in	London.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“London	hasn’t	been	populated	since	the	late	twenty-first	century.	It	also	says</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	died	in	Silverwood.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	is	Silverwood?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	laughs.	“But	you	aren’t	Mathew	Erlang.	It	upset	Dr	Lapin	because</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	believes	in	these	systems	and	thinks	they	are	infallible.	I	don’t	agree.	I	don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe	any	system	is	infallible.	Nothing	humans	build,	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	opens,	and	Evgeny	brings	in	food. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov	 doesn’t	 move	 but	 watches	 Evgeny	 hand	 a	 bowl	 and	 a	 spoon	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 with	 the	 same	 unwavering	 expression	 of	 contempt.	 Evgeny	 doesn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">speak	to	Mathew,	doesn’t	even	look	at	him,	and	backs	away	through	the	door,	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	afraid	to	turn	his	back	on	the	colonel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	did	you	eat	in	the	jungle?”	Dragomirov	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bananas.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	what	did	you	drink?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Water.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	did	you	get	the	water?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“From	the	river.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	 you	 should	 be	 dead.	 The	 river	 is	 full	 of	 disease.	 Have	 you	 taken</p>
<p class="calibre1">malaria	medication?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	shakes	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 gazes	 at	 him	 with	 mock	 admiration.	 “Remarkable.	 A	 medical</p>
<p class="calibre1">marvel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	medibots,”	Mathew	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man’s	face	pales	slightly.	“Do	you?”	he	says.	“You	know	those	are	illegal</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 the	 non-Pure	 in	 206	 sovereign	 states	 around	 the	 world.	 And	 you	 are	 non-Pure,	 you	 know.	 We’ll	 have	 to	 have	 the	 doctor	 examine	 you	 properly	 later; perhaps	he	will	help	you	and	kill	your	medibots.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean,	non-Pure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	mean	you	are	imperfect	like	most	of	the	rest	of	us.	Not	whole.	Unable	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">contribute	 to	 the	 continuance	 of	 the	 human	 race.	 It’s	 a	 pity	 for	 you,	 because	 it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>might	have	saved	you.	Even	I	won’t	kill	the	Pure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	understand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	understand	much,	do	you?	How	many	days	did	you	say	you	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	on	your	own,	after	you	lost	your	father,	as	you	say?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	lost	count.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Roughly?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 thinks	 and	 then	 says,	 “Four	 nights.	 Five	 if	 you	 count	 the	 night	 I spent	with	your	men	in	the	jungle.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov	 indicates	 the	 bowl	 of	 food	 in	 Mathew’s	 hands.	 “You’re	 eating</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 disgusting	 bile	 like	 it’s	 something	 special.	 You’re	 either	 a	 good	 actor,	 or what	you’re	saying	is	at	least	partly	true.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	true,”	Mathew	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 sniffs,	 watches	 Mathew	 finish	 his	 meal,	 stands	 abruptly,	 walks	 to the	door,	and	leans	his	back	against	it,	his	legs	crossed	at	the	ankles,	observing</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 know,	 in	 all	 my	 years	 in	 the	 military,	 I’ve	 never	 come	 across	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">successful	chip	hacker.”	He	says	this	with	genuine	admiration.	“ATLAS	may	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">close	to	annihilation,	but	it	still	has	one	or	two	clever	people.	It’s	a	shame.”	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">bangs	 on	 the	 door,	 which	 is	 promptly	 opened.	 “We’re	 taking	 the	 boy	 to	 the medical	block,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov	 gives	 Mathew	 his	 spider	 smile	 and	 gestures	 with	 an	 open	 hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shall	we?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr	Lapin	is	waiting	in	the	examination	room.	It’s	a	hut	like	the	prison	block, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	the	walls	are	hung	with	white	cupboards,	and	it’s	equipped	with	an	array	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">strange	machines.	The	doctor	gestures	towards	the	tall	bed	on	wheels	on	one	side</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sit,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov	 stands	 in	 the	 corner,	 his	 arms	 folded,	 speaking	 to	 the	 doctor	 in Russian.	 The	 doctor	 nods	 and	 turns	 to	 the	 counter	 underneath	 the	 cupboards, where	he	selects	something,	takes	off	a	wrapper,	and	comes	to	Mathew	holding	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">syringe	with	a	long	needle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Blood	sample,”	he	says	in	stilted	English. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	says	something	in	Russian	to	Dragomirov. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov	says	to	Mathew,	“He	wants	you	to	roll	up	your	sleeve.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	doctor	takes	the	syringe	full	of	blood	to	the	side	of	the	room	and	drops</p>
<p class="calibre1">small	 amounts	 into	 various	 tubes	 sitting	 on	 a	 tray	 attached	 to	 a	 machine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unrolling	 a	 kind	 of	 thin,	 transparent	 Paper,	 he	 snaps	 it	 to	 a	 frame.	 Then	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>presses	 a	 couple	 of	 buttons	 on	 the	 machine,	 and	 numbers	 and	 words	 start	 to scroll	 onto	 the	 Paper.	 The	 doctor	 stands	 in	 front	 of	 it,	 apparently	 issuing	 voice commands	 in	 Russian.	 Dragomirov	 stands	 beside	 him.	 Lapin	 points,	 and	 they</p>
<p class="calibre1">talk	 in	 Russian.	 By	 the	 tone	 of	 his	 voice,	 the	 colonel	 is	 displeased.	 The	 doctor raises	 his	 hands	 defensively.	 Dragomirov	 walks	 to	 the	 door,	 opens	 it	 suddenly, and	barks	an	order	at	the	guard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	says	to	Mathew,	“Okay,	we’re	done	in	here.	You	go	with	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guard	waits	for	Mathew	on	the	other	side	of	the	door.	Mathew	leaves	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">room,	blood	trickling	down	his	arm.	The	doctor	doesn’t	notice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	no	way	of	telling	what	time	it	is	in	his	cell.	The	daylight	is	endless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	the	guard	brought	him	back	from	the	medical	block,	he	has	been	alone	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 room	 for	 what	 seems	 like	 several	 hours,	 although	 it	 is	 difficult	 to	 say	 for sure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	marvels	at	this	game	he’s	in	and	wonders	how	Lestrange	created	it.	What</p>
<p class="calibre1">kind	 of	 advanced	 tele-existence	 and	 haptic	 technologies	 produce	 such	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">persistent	 sense	 of	 reality?	 It	 must	 involve	 brain-altering	 chemicals	 delivered somehow	via	that	innocent-looking	skullcap	in	Lestrange’s	Darkroom.	Although, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 thinks,	 as	 with	 the	 crudest	 video-and-audio-only	 virtual	 reality,	 the	 longer you’re	 in	 them,	 the	 more	 accustomed	 you	 become	 to	 the	 sensory	 experience</p>
<p class="calibre1">provided,	 and	 the	 more	 convinced	 you	 become	 of	 their	 reality.	 There	 are</p>
<p class="calibre1">probably	 some	 obvious	 seams	 in	 the	 program	 he’s	 not	 registering.	 But	 these thoughts	 will	 do	 him	 no	 good,	 when	 his	 priority	 should	 be	 to	 discover	 how	 to play	and	win	the	game.	Right	now,	he	has	the	distinct	idea	he’s	losing	in	every</p>
<p class="calibre1">conceivable	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	are	noises	in	the	corridor.	The	door	opens,	and	Evgeny	comes	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">room	with	a	tray;	the	door	is	shut	and	locked	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Evgeny!	What	time	is	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dinner	time.	I	am	not	allowed	to	speak	to	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please.	I	have	no	idea	what	is	going	on.	You	have	to	help	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t.	They	will	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	are	they	keeping	me	here?	Why	are	they	taking	blood	samples?	What’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrong	with	my	bioID?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.”	Evgeny	is	harassed.	His	hands	shake	as	he	passes	Mathew	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bowl	 of	 roasted	 fish	 and	 steamed	 vegetables.	 Pressing	 a	 fork	 into	 his	 hand,	 he says,	“Eat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	puts	a	jug	of	water	and	a	cup	on	the	floor.	“You	must	drink,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stands	to	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	ATLAS?”	Mathew	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a>Evgeny	gapes	at	Mathew	like	he	is	stupid.	“It	is	our	enemy.	It	is	where	you are	from.	England.	The	United	States.	Europe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	year	is	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	are	a	crazy	boy.	You	must	have	fallen	from	the	sky.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	I	fell	from	the	sky.	What	year	is	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“2472.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	soldier	bangs	on	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evgeny	is	frightened.	“I	must	go.	You	drink.”	He	thuds	back,	signalling	he	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">ready.	As	the	door	opens,	the	guard	exchanges	sharp	words	with	him.	The	door</p>
<p class="calibre1">closes	with	a	bang. </p>
<p class="calibre1">2472. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	is	in	the	future.	That’s	why	he’s	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">21	Borodin	the	Cat</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Whomp,	whomp,	whomp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	hear	the	chopper	before	they	see	it.	It	comes	in	low	over	the	treetops, </p>
<p class="calibre1">creating	a	mini-cyclone,	flattening	and	splaying	leaves,	bending	boughs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov	 hurries	 from	 his	 hut,	 still	 pulling	 on	 his	 jacket.	 Major	 Anatoly Rostov,	his	second	in	command,	is	with	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	the	hell	is	this	man?”	Dragomirov	is	asking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	the	district	 governor	of	the	 Chukotka	Autonomous	Okrug.	 This	is	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">territory,	and	he	wants	to	understand	what	you	are	doing	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Didn’t	you	send	the	authorisation	through?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 have	 clearance	 from	 the	 head	 of	 the	 FSB.	 What	 else	 does	 he	 need	 to know?	What’s	his	name?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Polkovnik	Konstantin	Borodin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	we	have	on	him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	much.	No	one	seems	to	know	anything	about	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov	 laughs.	 “He	 can’t	 be	 anyone	 then,	 can	 he?	 Let’s	 get	 this	 over with	quickly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	walk	towards	the	helipad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	district	governor	is	already	climbing	from	the	copter,	his	head	bowed	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	way	of	the	blades,	walking	directly	towards	Dragomirov.	He’s	a	big	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 a	 broad	 chest,	 well-muscled;	 he	 moves	 in	 a	 confident,	 curiously	 fluid motion.	The	sinews	in	his	neck	are	so	defined	under	his	skin	they	seem	like	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	be	plucked.	His	face	is	chiselled,	his	jaw	strong,	and	he	has	strange	green</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes.	 They	 salute	 each	 other.	 They	 are	 of	 equivalent	 rank.	 This	 is	 a	 problem, Dragomirov	realises. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov’s	 private	 hut	 has	 a	 sitting	 room	 with	 armchairs,	 a	 rug,	 and	 a makeshift	 fireplace	 with	 a	 mantelpiece,	 a	 painting	 of	 an	 old-fashioned	 Russian dacha	above	it.	In	front	of	the	armchairs	is	an	antique	coffee	table.	There’s	a	hot</p>
<p class="calibre1">samovar	 in	 the	 corner	 of	 the	 room,	 a	 tea	 service	 on	 the	 table.	 Dragomirov	 has poured	 the	 tea	 himself.	 Half	 a	 fresh	 lemon	 sits	 in	 a	 saucer,	 and	 a	 china	 bowl decorated	 with	 painted	 violets	 contains	 lumps	 of	 brown	 and	 white	 sugar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov	is	sitting	with	his	legs	crossed,	relaxed	in	his	armchair,	sipping	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">tea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	Borodin,	what	brings	you	this	way?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Borodin’s	 voice	 is	 deep,	 guttural,	 a	 purr.	 Sitting	 in	 the	 armchair,	 he	 is	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>bundle	of	contained	energy	and	loaded,	poised	muscle,	as	though	he	might	leap up	 at	 any	 moment.	 He	 makes	 the	 chair	 seem	 like	 a	 toy.	 He	 doesn’t	 seem	 to belong	in	the	room,	or	any	room.	He	says,	“You	have	a	prisoner.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	we	do.	How	do	you	know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	tracking	him	myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	were	you	tracking	him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	is	a	foreigner	in	Russian	territory	and	doesn’t	belong	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	well,	you	don’t	need	to	worry	now.	We	have	him.	All	is	well.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 I	 do	 have	 to	 worry.	 This	 is	 my	 territory.	 A	 foreigner	 from	 an	 enemy nation	 has	 fallen	 from	 the	 sky	 into	 Siberia.	 It’s	 concerning	 to	 me.	 Teenagers don’t	usually	wander	unaccompanied	around	rain	forests,	not	for	long,	anyway.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">need	to	know	what	you	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	saw	the	communication	from	my	staff?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	of	course.	Which	is	why	I	came	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	you	know	I	am	here	on	classified	business.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 thought	 you	 would	 say	 that,”	 Borodin	 says.	 He	 is	 bored,	 Dragomirov</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinks.	“Check	your	Paper.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	said,	check	your	Paper.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov	unfolds	the	portable	Paper	he	keeps	in	his	chest	pocket.	There	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 flag	 on	 the	 screen.	 A	 message	 from	 Central	 Command.	 Classified.	 The	 usual bureaucratic	 language,	 but	 the	 gist	 of	 it:	 Give	 Colonel	 Borodin	 your	 full cooperation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	did	you	do	this?”	Dragomirov	asks,	flabbergasted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Borodin	fixes	him	with	his	steady	green	eyes.	“We	are	at	war.	I	am	in	charge</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 a	 highly	 strategic	 territory.	 I	 want	 to	 know	 what’s	 going	 on.	 Have	 you interrogated	him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	interviewed	him	yesterday.	His	story	is	inconsistent.	His	bioID	is	giving	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">strange	readout.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	what	way?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	has	the	bioID	of	someone	who	died	381	years	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Borodin	 doesn’t	 show	 any	 sign	 of	 surprise,	 doesn’t	 laugh	 or	 even	 raise	 an eyebrow.	Not	a	muscle	on	his	face	moves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov	 asks,	 “You	 don’t	 think	 it’s	 odd?	 Have	 you	 come	 across	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1">before,	Polkovnik?	This	kind	of	anomaly?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Borodin	ignores	the	question.	“Why	are	you	interested	in	this	boy?	Why	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	here	in	my	territory?	Why	does	the	government	think	it	a	good	idea	to	send</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 here?”	 He	 says	 this	 with	 such	 direct	 rudeness	 that	 Dragomirov	 is	 amazed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 were	 tracking	 someone	 else,	 weren’t	 you?	 You	 weren’t	 searching	 for	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>boy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 Dragomirov	 smiles,	 a	 spider	 again.	 “For	 weeks	 we	 have	 tracked</p>
<p class="calibre1">ATLAS	terrorists	across	your	territory.	I	am	surprised,	frankly,	that	your	people</p>
<p class="calibre1">weren’t	aware	of	this.	I’m	amazed	they	failed	to	notice	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	lost	the	terrorists,	Dragomirov.”	The	word	terrorists	is	accented	with	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">fingers.	 “You	 found	 this	 boy	 accidentally.	 You	 think	 he’s	 like	 the	 one	 you	 had but	lost.	He	isn’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	does	he	know	this? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov	is	open-mouthed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	 he	 regains	 his	 composure,	 Borodin	 is	 on	 his	 feet,	 the	 coiled	 energy suddenly	released. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	taking	the	prisoner.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?	 No.	 You	 won’t	 take	 the	 prisoner.”	 Dragomirov	 scrambles	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">armchair,	putting	his	teacup	down	with	a	clatter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	will	take	him.	You	read	the	orders.	Full	cooperation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov	gathers	himself.	His	eyes	are	barely	level	with	the	buttons	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">chest	 of	 Borodin’s	 jacket.	 There’s	 no	 way	 for	 him	 to	 look	 this	 man	 in	 the	 eye, unless	he	stands	on	a	ladder.	It	makes	him	angry.	He	says,	“I	want	authorisation</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	this	matter	from	the	Security	Council.	I	want	them	made	aware	of	a	reference</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	a	specific	FSB	case.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Borodin	gazes	down	at	him	with	what	Dragomirov	imagines	is	an	indulgent</p>
<p class="calibre1">expression.	 “Go	 and	 check	 with	 your	 committees.	 If	 you	 don’t	 have	 an	 answer by	tomorrow	morning,	I	am	taking	the	boy	with	me.”	Borodin	goes	to	the	door</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	hut.	“But	if	you	want	my	advice,	I	would	give	up.	The	war	is	coming	to	its</p>
<p class="calibre1">climax.	Go	home	and	be	with	your	family.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Livid	 with	 anger,	 Dragomirov	 spits,	 “You	 will	 get	 communication	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">director	tonight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Borodin	 half-shrugs,	 as	 if	 the	 response	 was	 inevitable.	 “Don’t	 concern</p>
<p class="calibre1">yourself	 with	 hospitality	 for	 me	 and	 my	 men,”	 he	 says.	 “We	 brought	 our	 own shelter	and	supplies.”	He	pushes	open	the	door,	and	then	he	is	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov	 is	 in	 the	 briefing	 room	 with	 Dr	 Lapin	 and	 Major	 Rostov.	 He’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">agitated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doctor,	what	do	you	need	from	me	to	complete	your	tests?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	need	to	get	him	back	to	Moscow	to	test	him	thoroughly,	but	I	told	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 blood	 tests	 I	 ran	 yesterday	 were	 normal.	 There	 was	 nothing	 like	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">anomalies	we	saw	with	Lamplighter.	His	blood	is	pedestrian,	with	the	exception</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 medibot,	 which	 is,	 of	 course,	 illegal.	 There	 was	 one	 strange	 thing, though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>“Yes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“His	 medibot	 is	 exactly	 like	 the	 type	 in	 common	 use	 at	 the	 outbreak	 of	 the First	Space	War.	He	is	wearing	a	Lenz	and	an	e-Pin,	but	they	are	also	of	an	old</p>
<p class="calibre1">design	and	use	protocols	long	defunct.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	are	telling	me	you	think	this	boy	is	433	years	old?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 doctor	 smiles	 and	 shakes	 his	 head.	 “No,	 no.	 As	 I	 said,	 it’s	 impossible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	 saying	 the	 technology	 is	 consistent	 with	 the	 identity	 he	 is	 assuming.	 It’s consistent	with	the	data	in	his	bioID.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meaning	this	is	an	elaborate	hoax?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	would	the	ATLAS	secret	services	send	a	sixteen-year-old	secret	agent</p>
<p class="calibre1">deep	 into	 enemy	 territory	 unsupported?	 Why	 on	 earth	 would	 his	 cover	 be	 time travel?”	Rostov	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov	says,	“He	is	part	of	the	group	of	maggots	with	the	Lamplighter.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">am	 sure	 of	 it.	 Doctor,	 you	 need	 to	 keep	 working	 on	 this	 boy.	 Maybe	 they’ve found	a	way	to	mask	his	biological	anomalies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	I	need	to	get	him	back	to	Moscow.	There’s	no	more	for	me	to	do	with</p>

<p class="calibre1">“We	need	to	get	this	man	Borodin	off	our	backs.	He	knows	far	too	much.	It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">strange,”	Dragomirov	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps	he	was	briefed	by	Central	Command	Centre.	Their	communication</p>
<p class="calibre1">did	indicate	he	has	the	highest	clearance,”	replies	Rostov. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	 one	 knows	 about	 this	 mission	 but	 us	 and	 the	 director	 of	 the	 FSB.	 This whole	thing	with	the	authorisation	is	odd.	I	don’t	believe	it,”	says	Dragomirov. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	taken	a	look	at	it	myself.	It’s	genuine.	I	even	requested	and	received	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">confirmation.	But	he’s	on	the	same	side	as	us.	Shouldn’t	we	bring	him	in?”	asks</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rostov. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	I	want	him	gone.”	Dragomirov	stares	at	his	shoes.	He	says,	“Get	me	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">meeting	with	the	director	in	Moscow	as	soon	as	possible.	We	need	to	make	sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	 control	 the	 prisoner.	 Let’s	 get	 Borodin	 off	 our	 backs,	 and	 then	 we’ll	 get authorisation	to	send	you	back	to	Moscow	with	the	prisoner,	doctor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	you?”	Lapin	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	 going	 to	 stay	 and	 continue	 to	 hunt	 down	 Lamplighter,”	 Dragomirov</p>
<p class="calibre1">says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rostov	stands,	ready	to	go	and	execute	orders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov	 looks	 at	 him.	 “There’s	 something	 else,	 Major.	 We	 have	 a	 weak</p>
<p class="calibre1">link.	 Someone	 is	 leaking	 information,	 and	 it’s	 getting	 back	 to	 Borodin.	 Let’s make	sure	it’s	no	one	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	on	it,”	Rostov	says. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A	few	miles	from	base	camp,	an	odd	group	of	men	and	women	sit	around	a</p>

<p class="calibre1">They	are	the	strangest	army	in	the	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	priest,	one	of	the	grey	heads,	dressed	in	a	threadbare	dog	collar,	leads	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">group	 in	 prayer.	 They	 hold	 hands.	 The	 tall,	 gaunt	 man	 they	 call	 Lev,	 short	 for Angel	Leventis,	opens	his	eyes	during	the	prayer	and	winks	at	an	elderly	woman</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	garishly	dyed	red	hair	and	skin	so	gnarled	her	face	is	like	one	of	the	trees</p>

<p class="calibre1">arms	 the	 size	 of	 most	 thighs,	 and	 no	 legs.	 His	 face	 is	 set	 in	 an	 expression	 of concentrated	 piety,	 and	 he	 holds	 the	 hands	 of	 his	 wife	 on	 one	 side	 and	 his teenaged	son	on	the	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oblivious,	 the	 priest	 gives	 thanks	 for	 their	 food,	 for	 their	 lives,	 for	 their opportunity	in	history.	The	priest	asks	for	God’s	protection	on	one	last	mission</p>

<p class="calibre1">Speaking	 English,	 after	 all,	 is	 deeply	 suspect.	 The	 way	 he	 behaves	 with	 the foreign	 boy	 prisoner	 is	 odd.	 Plus,	 he	 makes	 them	 eat	 those	 disgusting	 biscuits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 are	 all	 ready	 to	 serve	 him	 up	 to	 Dragomirov,	 but	 they	 have	 to	 find	 him first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s	not	in	the	cookhouse	or	in	the	mess.	He’s	not	down	at	the	wash	block	or</p>

<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 cleared	 land	 next	 to	 the	 edge	 of	 the	 forest	 near	 the	 water,	 the	 district governor’s	men	have	set	up	camp.	They	have	a	roaring	fire	going	under	a	fish-laden	spit.	They	have	tarpaulins	and	hammocks.	A	couple	of	the	men	are	cutting</p>
<p class="calibre1">wood	 at	 the	 edge	 of	 the	 jungle	 with	 machetes.	 Another	 is	 gutting	 and	 washing more	fish	in	the	river. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	Klokov	spots	the	cook	walking	across	from	their	camp,	with	one	of	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">Klokov	 is	 convinced	 Evgeny	 is	 the	 mole.	 But	 he	 wants	 to	 hear	 what	 he’s</p>

<p class="calibre1">the	 forest,	 taking	 a	 circuit	 all	 the	 way	 around	 the	 boundary	 of	 the	 settlement, until	he’s	next	to	Borodin’s	camp.	The	fire	is	on	the	edge	of	the	clearing.	The	fat</p>
<p class="calibre1">cook	is	still	talking	to	Borodin’s	soldier.	His	name	is	Yolkov.	Their	voices	carry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Standing	with	his	back	to	a	large	kapok	tree,	Klokov	listens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	like	to	put	thyme	inside	the	fish	skins.	These	river	fish	have	a	strong	taste. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	takes	the	edge	off,”	says	Evgeny.	Delving	into	his	pocket,	he	pulls	out	some</p>

<p class="calibre1">“I’m	meant	to	know	how	to	do	all	these	things.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evgeny	nods	sympathetically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	 you	 always	 camp	 in	 the	 jungle?	 I	 would	 have	 thought	 Borodin	 would</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	a	more	civilised	base	camp.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 he	 does,	 back	 in	 Uelen.	 A	 proper	 barracks,	 parade	 ground,	 a	 nearby</p>
<p class="calibre1">town	 with	 restaurants	 and	 shops.	 It’s	 civilised.	 But	 we’re	 hardly	 ever	 there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Borodin	 likes	 to	 tour	 his	 territory.	 Recently,	 we’ve	 trekked	 over	 every	 inch	 of this	 godforsaken	 snake	 and	 spider	 pit	 of	 an	 ant-infested	 excuse	 for	 a	 strip	 of jungle,	looking	for	god-only-knows	what.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it	true	they	call	him	the	Cat,	your	colonel?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yolkov	nods.	“We	all	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On	account	of?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“His	eyes.	The	way	he	walks.	And	the	fact	he’ll	track	any	living	thing	in	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Ha!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course,	it’s	nonsense.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	it	is!	Pot	is	full.”	Evgeny	switches	off	the	hose	using	a	nozzle	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	end,	lays	it	on	the	ground	and	checks	the	fish,	then	selects	a	potato	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bag	on	the	floor	and	starts	to	peel	it	with	his	pocket	knife.	Handing	a	potato	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Yolkov,	he	says,	“Here.	I’m	not	doing	all	the	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yolkov	starts	to	peel.	“Five	months	in	this	hell-hole,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	been	on	the	road	a	year.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	year!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evgeny	 nods.	 “We	 started	 in	 the	 desert,	 would	 you	 believe	 it,	 and	 then	 we went	everywhere	there	is	to	go	on	the	Federation	map.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	have	a	family?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	 A	 wife,	 Marta.”	 Evgeny	 digs	 into	 the	 inside	 pocket	 of	 his	 shirt,	 pulls out	a	crumpled,	faded	photograph.	“And	Edik,	my	son.	See,	he	is	fifteen.	Getting</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	tall!	Do	you	have	kids?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	a	wife,	Bria.	No	children.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evgeny	holds	Yolkov’s	eyes,	sorry	to	have	made	so	much	of	his	son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	you	miss	them?	All	that	time	on	the	road!	A	year!”	Yolkov	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	 course	 I	 miss	 them!	 Like	 missing	 limbs.	 I	 wish	 we’d	 finish	 this	 crazy</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a>mission	Dragomirov	is	on.	Then	I	can	go	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 want	 a	 hot	 shower,	 running	 water,	 a	 cold	 beer,	 dry	 socks,	 a	 proper	 bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	 though	 it	 would	 mean	 certain	 court	 martial,	 I	 would	 walk	 back	 to	 town now	 if	 I	 thought	 I	 had	 a	 cat-in-hell’s	 chance	 of	 making	 it	 five	 hundred	 yards through	the	jungle	alive.	.	.	.	It	is	odd	the	boy	survived.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 a	 mystery	 how	 he	 got	 here	 in	 the	 first	 place.	 Doesn’t	 speak	 a	 word	 of Russian.	Luckily,	I	speak	English.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	spoke	to	him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	with	the	group	that	found	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	he	what	Dragomirov	was	hunting	for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	I	don’t	think	so.	Dragomirov	is	searching	for	a	girl.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	girl?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	call	her	the	Lamplighter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	does?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	maggots.	The	non-people	living	beyond	the	city	walls.	They	think	she’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	kind	of	sign.	I	don’t	know.	It’s	all	crazy	stuff.	Anyhow,	she	caused	several</p>
<p class="calibre1">rebellions	 amongst	 the	 maggots,	 whether	 she	 intended	 to	 or	 not.	 Dragomirov caught	her	at	one	point	and	took	her	to	a	lab	for	Dr	Lapin	to	examine	with	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">machines.	 Some	 of	 the	 men	 say	 Dragomirov	 thinks	 she’s	 some	 kind	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">weapon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	weapon?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	some	kind	of	hyper-tech	advanced,	enhanced	human.	But	the	men	talk</p>
<p class="calibre1">nonsense	most	of	the	time.	Half	of	them	think	the	world	is	about	to	end.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	men	laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	happened	to	the	girl?”	Yolkov	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	 escaped.	 God	 knows	 how.	 We	 have	 the	 tightest	 security	 imaginable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	 the	 man	 is	 obsessed	 with	 trying	 to	 get	 her	 back.”	 Evgeny	 stops	 talking suddenly.	 It	 occurs	 to	 him	 he’s	 doing	 what	 he	 has	 been	 told	 many	 times	 he shouldn’t	do,	shooting	his	mouth	off.	He	says,	“I	should	be	getting	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still	 with	 his	 back	 pressed	 against	 the	 tree,	 Klokov	 is	 soaking	 up	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversation	 with	 a	 surging	 glee.	 He	 has	 caught	 the	 traitor	 red-handed	 and	 can hardly	wait	to	get	back	to	Churkin	and	tell	him	what	he’s	heard.	Dragomirov	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">praise	him	for	his	vigilance.	He	thinks	about	the	promotion	he’ll	surely	get	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	the	benefits	that	go	with	it.	No	more	damned	mouldy	biscuits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	without	warning,	without	sound	or	the	faintest	disturbance	to	alert	him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">something	cold	and	sharp	presses	against	the	skin	of	his	neck.	Cold	like	metal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharp	 like	 a	 knife.	 Straining	 his	 eyes	 down,	 he	 sees	 it.	 There	 is	 a	 hand	 and	 an arm,	holding	a	blade	to	his	throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>A	 voice	 says,	 “Don’t	 move.	 Don’t	 even	 breathe.	 I	 will	 kill	 you	 right	 here, drag	your	body	into	the	forest	for	the	night	creatures	to	clean,	and	never	give	it	a second	 thought.”	 It’s	 a	 deep,	 growling	 kind	 of	 a	 voice.	 The	 knife	 slowly	 lifts from	 Klokov’s	 skin.	 Breathing	 out	 with	 relief,	 he	 staggers	 forward.	 Borodin comes	 from	 behind	 the	 tree,	 sheathing	 his	 knife.	 “Why	 are	 you	 spying	 on	 my camp	and	my	men?	Why	are	you	creeping	around?	I	could	have	killed	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Klokov	scrambles	to	salute.	“I	wasn’t	spying	on	your	men,	sir.	I	was	spying</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	one	of	ours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our	fat	cook.	I’ll	show	you.”	Hard-ass	leads	Borodin	the	few	steps	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">undergrowth	to	the	fire	with	the	spit	and	the	cooking	pot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yolkov	 is	 tending	 to	 the	 roasting	 fish	 and	 peers	 through	 streaming,	 smoky eyes	as	Borodin	approaches	and	salutes.	Evgeny	has	disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov’s	face	and	neck	are	red.	He’s	having	a	terrible	evening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First,	 Rostov	 came	 to	 tell	 him	 that	 the	 FSB	 director	 isn’t	 available	 for	 a conference	 call,	 but	 he	 sent	 a	 message	 to	 say	 that	 Borodin	 is	 one	 of	 the	 best trackers	in	the	Russian	army	and	Dragomirov	should	make	full	use	of	his	skills</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 resources	 in	 his	 search	 for	 the	 Lamplighter,	 and	 he	 must	 respect	 Borodin’s rank	 and	 authority.	 In	 other	 words,	 Dragomirov	 is	 going	 to	 have	 to	 bow	 and scrape	to	the	overgrown	animal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,	 before	 Rostov	 has	 even	 finished,	 Borodin	 himself	 has	 come	 bursting</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	his	private	quarters,	shoving	ahead	of	him	some	cretin	from	the	lower	ranks, </p>
<p class="calibre1">bringing	in	all	sorts	of	jungle	debris	on	the	bottom	of	his	boots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	found	this	man	hiding	in	the	trees	beside	my	camp.	By	his	own	admission</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	was	spying.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Klokov	is	shaken.	This	isn’t	how	he	imagined	things	at	all.	“I	wasn’t	spying</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	Colonel	Borodin’s	men,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rostov,	smarting	from	the	dressing-down	he’s	just	received	on	account	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">failed	 attempt	 to	 organise	 a	 call	 with	 the	 FSB	 director,	 yells	 at	 Klokov,	 “Did anyone	ask	you	to	speak,	soldat?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	sir!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	shut	up!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	were	you	doing	in	Colonel	Borodin’s	camp?”	Dragomirov	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Klokov	hesitates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Major	Rostov	yells,	“Speak	when	you’re	asked	a	question!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir!	I	was	following	soldat	Evgeny	Shukshin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?	Why?”	Dragomirov	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Following	orders,	sir!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>“Whose	orders?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kapral	Andrei	Churkin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov	sighs	and	says	to	Rostov,	“Major,	go	and	get	Churkin.”	Rostov</p>
<p class="calibre1">moves	 towards	 the	 door.	 “Actually,	 hold	 on,	 Rostov.”	 Dragomirov	 turns	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Klokov	again.	“Do	you	know	why	Kapral	Churkin	wanted	you	to	follow	–	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	it	again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rostov	and	Klokov	both	say	“Shukshin”	at	the	same	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov	nods.	“Do	you	know	why	you	were	ordered	to	follow	this	man?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	thought	he	was	a	spy,	sir!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	spy?	Who	was	he	supposed	to	be	spying	on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Us.	For	Colonel	Dragomirov,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov,	confused,	frowns	at	Rostov.	“Any	idea	what’s	going	on	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 penny	 drops	 for	 Major	 Rostov,	 with	 a	 cold,	 creeping	 horror.	 He	 says, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	I’m	not	sure	we	want	to	discuss	.	.	.”	He	tries	to	indicate	Borodin	with	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes,	but	Dragomirov	snaps	impatiently.	“Say	it,	whatever	it	is,	Major.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	briefed	Churkin	and	other	section	leaders	yesterday,	sir.	I	asked	them	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">vigilant	 and	 not	 discuss	 or	 share	 classified	 information.	 I	 also	 asked	 them	 to search	for	weak	links	in	their	ranks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	did	you	ask	them	that,	Major	Rostov?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	you	asked	me	to,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	did?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.	You	said	you	thought	we	have	a	leak.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov	 remembers	 and	 coughs,	 not	 daring	 to	 even	 glance	 at	 Borodin, </p>
<p class="calibre1">who’s	standing	silently	in	the	corner	of	the	room,	observing.	He	turns	to	Klokov. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	what	did	you	find?	Is	.	.	.	What’s	his	name	again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Soldat	Evgeny	Shukshin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	Shukshin	a	spy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,”	says	Klokov. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rostov	says,	“You’re	sure?	This	is	a	serious	allegation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Borodin	speaks	from	the	shadows,	his	low	growl	of	a	voice	making	Klokov</p>
<p class="calibre1">noticeably	paler.	“What	is	your	evidence?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Evidence,	sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On	what	basis	are	you	accusing	your	fellow	soldier	of	treachery?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 heard	 him	 speak	 to	 your	 cook,	 sir,	 and	 he	 passed	 on	 classified</p>
<p class="calibre1">information.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	did	he	actually	say?”	Dragomirov	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	spoke	of	cooking	and	his	family.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	did	he	say	relevant	to	your	accusation?”	Rostov	says,	impatiently. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>“It	is	relevant.	It’s	context.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Context?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“His	 character.	 What	 sort	 of	 man	 he	 is,	 soft	 and	 weak.	 A	 liar	 and	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">blabbermouth,	stealing	food	from	our	kitchen	to	give	to	Colonel	Borodin’s	cook. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	he	lied	about	his	family.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Giving	 army	 food	 to	 others	 members	 of	 the	 same	 army	 is	 not	 stealing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arguably,	it’s	helpful	behaviour	and	commendable,”	Borodin	says.	“How	did	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">lie?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	showed	your	cook	a	photograph	of	his	family.	He’s	always	showing	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">photo	to	strangers.	Anyone	who	will	listen,	boasting	of	having	a	son.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	is	that	lying?	Does	he	not	have	a	son?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rostov	 clears	 his	 throat.	 “He	 did	 have	 a	 son.	 His	 entire	 family	 died	 in	 a wildfire	 five	 years	 ago	 while	 he	 was	 away	 on	 active	 duty,	 but	 it	 won’t	 go	 in here,”	he	says,	violently	tapping	his	own	forehead	in	a	way	that	must	have	hurt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 sounds	 like	 the	 man	 is	 due	 sympathy	 and	 understanding	 more	 than</p>
<p class="calibre1">condemnation,”	Borodin	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	a	dangerous	thing	to	fight	with	weak-minded	men,”	Dragomirov	says, </p>
<p class="calibre1">focusing	on	Rostov,	who	looks	uncomfortable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Borodin	says,	“Presumably,	you	have	been	aware	of	these	things	for	a	while</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	have	found	him	able	to	perform	his	duties	–	otherwise,	he	wouldn’t	be	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	isn’t	a	revelation	to	you,	surely?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov	 was	 barely	 aware	 of	 the	 cook’s	 name	 and	 rank	 before	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment,	 but	 he	 isn’t	 going	 to	 give	 Borodin	 the	 satisfaction,	 so	 he	 inclines	 his head	in	a	gesture	that	might	be	interpreted	as	agreement	or	might	be	stretching, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	turns	again	to	Klokov.	“Well?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	meant	he’s	not	alright	in	the	head,	not	to	be	trusted.	He	said	other	things	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Colonel	Borodin’s	cook.	Classified	things.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don’t	 know	 if	 I	 should	 .	 .	 .”	 He	 glances	 at	 Borodin	 and	 then	 back	 at Dragomirov. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Borodin	says,	“If	this	information	was	passed	to	my	cook,	it	will	be	passed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	later	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Klokov	glances	at	Dragomirov,	who	nods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	 cook	 was	 complaining	 because	 you	 are	 constantly	 in	 the	 jungle,”	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">says	to	Borodin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov	smiles,	but	Borodin	is	poker-faced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shukshin	told	him	we’ve	been	on	the	road	for	more	than	a	year,	told	him	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Lamplighter.	He	told	him	we’d	lost	her	and	were	trying	to	find	her	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	already	know	about	the	Lamplighter,”	Borodin	says.	“Is	that	all?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>“Yes,”	Klokov	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Borodin	turns	to	Dragomirov.	“You	must	judge	your	own	men,	but	it	sounds</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	 nothing	 to	 me.	 Do	 you	 have	 any	 news	 on	 the	 authorisation	 you	 said	 you would	have	tonight?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov	 says,	 “We	 will	 have	 it	 later	 this	 evening.”	 Rostov	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov	 exchange	 glances,	 giving	 Dragomirov	 away	 to	 Borodin,	 but	 it</p>
<p class="calibre1">doesn’t	matter	because	he	already	knows	Dragomirov	is	lying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	me	know	as	soon	as	you	get	it	through,	won’t	you?	And	please	do	brief</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	 people	 not	 to	 snoop	 around	 my	 camp	 while	 we’re	 here.	 I	 am	 sometimes over-sensitive	on	the	matter	of	intruders	and	may	accidentally	slip	with	my	knife</p>
<p class="calibre1">next	time.	Goodnight.”	He	nods	at	Dragomirov	and	is	gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 is	 a	 special	 punishment	 cage	 beside	 the	 prison	 block.	 It’s	 made	 of wood	from	the	forest,	and	the	door	is	barred	with	a	thick	pole.	It	isn’t	possible	to stand	in	the	cage,	and	jungle	grass	and	earth	serve	as	the	floor,	making	it	easy	for any	snake,	spider,	or	insect	to	crawl	in.	It’s	rarely	used.	The	last	time	was	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">Osin	drank	a	day’s	worth	of	his	section’s	ration	of	vodka,	getting	sick	drunk	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">resulting	in	his	comrades	missing	their	daily	allocation.	No	one	argued	for	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	one	argues	for	the	mad	fat	cook,	either,	as	he	is	dragged	by	Klokov	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Churkin	across	the	yard,	with	Rostov	overseeing	and	Dragomirov	taking	it	all	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	door	of	his	quarters.	Evgeny	begs	and	sobs	and	grabs	at	the	doorframe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Klokov	merely	stamps	on	his	hands	and	pushes	him	inside	with	his	foot.	When</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	won’t	stop	crying,	he	pours	a	bucket	of	water	over	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Next	time	it	will	be	a	bucket	from	the	shithouse,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 enough,”	 Rostov	 says,	 and	 sends	 Klokov	 and	 Churkin	 back	 to	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">barracks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	Dragomirov	lingers	in	the	doorway,	wishing	Rostov	hadn’t	stopped	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">24	The	Night	Rescue</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Tuesday,	21	June	2472,	Siberia</p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	dead	of	the	short	night	the	forest	is	never	still.	A	million	life-and-death</p>
<p class="calibre1">battles	 are	 fought.	 Things	 crash	 through	 the	 undergrowth,	 fall	 from	 branches, splash	 through	 water,	 dislodge	 rocks	 on	 the	 mountainside,	 and	 scream	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">warning	 or	 pain.	 Nocturnal	 insects	 leap	 from	 leaf	 to	 leaf	 or	 flutter	 in	 the moonlight,	 singing	 to	 find	 mates,	 and	 reptiles	 with	 strange,	 giant,	 unblinking eyes	 hunt	 them	 and	 make	 meals	 of	 them.	 The	 alert	 and	 the	 paranoid	 could	 be driven	mad	listening	to	noises	in	the	forest	at	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	this	particular	night,	it	is	not	just	the	animals	on	the	prowl.	People	move</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 soft,	 sure	 feet,	 communicating	 without	 speaking,	 moving	 as	 one,	 without the	 need	 of	 light.	 They	 come	 down	 from	 the	 side	 of	 the	 mountain	 with	 such stealth,	even	the	hunters	and	the	hunted	do	not	see	them	go.	They	pass	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">thick	undergrowth	and	then	suddenly	disappear	as	if	they	were	never	there	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	is	in	a	fitful	sleep,	tossing	on	the	hard	bench	that	serves	as	his	bed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">shivering	 under	 the	 thin	 blanket.	 He	 is	 woken	 by	 the	 sound	 of	 his	 name	 being called	in	an	English	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Half-asleep,	 he	 thinks,  <i class="calibre4">It’s	 Mum	 saying	 she’s	 leaving	 for	 work.	 No…	 It’s	 a</i> <i class="calibre4">man’s	voice!	Dad? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 father	 had	 an	 accent.	 He	 hears	 the	 voice	 again,	 distinctly,	 and	 it	 fully wakes	him	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	hand	covers	his	mouth.	Someone	is	crouching	beside	him.	They	have	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">fingers	 pressed	 to	 their	 lips.	 In	 his	 head,	 clearly,	 not	 aloud:	 “Be	 quiet.	 Don’t make	a	sound.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whoever	it	is	is	speaking	to	him	via	his	e-Pin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s	pitch-dark,	but	there	is	a	dim	light	source	from	somewhere,	and	he	sees</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 the	 door	 to	 his	 cell	 is	 open.	 Are	 my	 Lenzes	 working	 now?	 He	 has	 night vision!	 In	 a	 blue-and-white	 wash	 of	 light	 he	 sees	 a	 man	 with	 wild	 grey	 hair,	 a tumbling	grey	beard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	Mathew’s	head,	not	aloud,	the	man	says,	“My	name	is	Lev.	I	am	a	friend, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 I’ve	 come	 to	 get	 you	 away	 from	 here.	 It’s	 important	 you	 are	 as	 quiet	 as possible.	 Do	 not	 speak.	 Think	 through	 if	 you	 want	 to	 say	 something.	 We	 have adjusted	 your	 Lenz	 and	 e-Pin	 so	 you	 can	 use	 them	 in	 this	 way.	 Be	 quick	 now! </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	need	to	leave.	You’ll	be	able	to	ask	all	the	questions	you	like	when	we	get	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">safety.	Come	quickly	now.	It	will	not	be	dark	for	much	longer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a>Mathew	gets	off	his	bench	and	goes	from	his	cell	into	the	corridor.	The	guard is	in	a	dead	sleep,	slumped	in	his	chair,	snoring,	catching	flies.	“Don’t	worry,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	not	wake	for	several	hours,”	the	grey-haired	man	says	in	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	to	the	guardhouse	is	open.	A	bank	of	clouds	covers	the	moon.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">follows	the	man,	bending	low,	keeping	to	the	shade	cast	by	the	guardhouse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	Mathew	spots	Evgeny.	He	has	seen	them,	too,	crouched	on	the	ground, </p>
<p class="calibre1">holding	 on	 to	 the	 wooden	 bars	 of	 his	 cage,	 his	 eyes	 wide.	 Mathew	 knows	 he wouldn’t	 say	 anything	 to	 anyone	 about	 their	 escape,	 but	 he	 doesn’t	 want	 to abandon	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 tugs	 on	 the	 shirt	 of	 the	 grey-haired	 man	 called	 Lev,	 thinking	 hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	my	friend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	must	have	got	through	to	the	man	because	he	nods.	“Alright.	Stay</p>
<p class="calibre1">here.	Do	not	move	for	now.	If	someone	finds	me,	crawl	under	this	building	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">wait	for	them	to	go.	When	it’s	clear,	head	for	the	biggest	tree,	right	ahead	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">edge	of	the	clearing.	People	will	meet	you	there.	Okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	nods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lifting	 the	 wooden	 pole	 locking	 the	 door	 of	 Evgeny’s	 cage,	 he	 sets	 it	 aside silently.	 As	 he’d	 done	 with	 Mathew,	 he	 puts	 his	 fingers	 to	 his	 lips.	 Evgeny appears	 to	 understand,	 crawling	 from	 the	 cage,	 and	 joining	 Mathew	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shadows	of	the	prison	block.	They	follow	Lev	to	the	end	of	the	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	will	be	the	most	dangerous	part.	We	need	to	get	to	that	tree.”	Mathew</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediately	 understands	 he	 means	 the	 tallest,	 thickest	 one	 on	 the	 boundary	 of the	clearing.	“Your	friend	can’t	hear	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	nods.	Touching	Evgeny	on	the	arm,	he	points	at	the	tree,	making	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">running	gesture	with	his	fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lev	walks	silently	into	the	twilight.	Evgeny	and	Mathew	follow	close	behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evgeny	 grabs	 the	 back	 of	 Mathew’s	 shirt,	 and	 Mathew	 guesses	 that	 Evgeny	 is effectively	blind,	walking	straight	into	darkness.	Low	clouds	cloak	the	lightening</p>
<p class="calibre1">sky	until	they	are	at	the	edge	of	the	clearing	and	under	the	shade	of	the	trees.	It’s still	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 night,	 but	 the	 sun	 is	 coming	 up,	 breaking	 golden	 light brilliantly	 across	 the	 camp.	 Mathew	 glances	 back,	 but	 Lev	 taps	 him	 on	 his shoulder	and	indicates	they	should	keep	moving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 walk	 no	 more	 than	 thirty	 feet.	 Lev	 bends	 down	 and	 lifts	 some	 banana leaves,	 revealing	 a	 deep	 hole	 in	 the	 ground,	 a	 vertical	 tunnel,	 just	 wider	 than	 a man’s	shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quickly,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	is	a	ladder.	Manoeuvring	himself	carefully,	Mathew	gets	his	feet	onto</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	rungs	and	starts	climbing	down.	Evgeny	follows.	When	Mathew	reaches	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bottom	and	raises	his	eyes,	Lev	is	at	the	top,	pulling	the	leaves	back	to	hide	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a>hole.	 Coming	 down	 after	 them,	 he	 collapses	 the	 ladder	 into	 a	 kind	 of	 portable stick	and	puts	it	in	a	bag	on	the	floor	at	the	base	of	the	hole,	which	he	slings	over his	shoulder.	Light	spills	across	the	hollow	from	a	lantern	on	the	floor.	Lev	grabs</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	and	uses	it	to	light	their	way.	Darkness	folds	behind	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’re	 walking	 along	 a	 narrow	 tunnel.	 Lev	 is	 tall,	 and	 his	 wild	 grey	 hair brushes	the	roof.	Evgeny	barely	fits	through.	The	tunnel	is	cut	from	the	bedrock</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	forest.	The	sides	are	polished	smooth.	They	walk	in	silence	for	what	feels</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	 a	 long	 time,	 perhaps	 twenty	 minutes,	 and	 then	 the	 tunnel	 starts	 to	 slope upwards.	Lev	stops,	puts	the	lantern	on	the	ground,	takes	the	ladder	stick	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 bag	 and	 throws	 it	 at	 the	 wall.	 It	 unfurls	 all	 the	 way	 to	 the	 top	 of	 a	 shaft directly	above	their	heads.	This	time	he	goes	first,	telling	them	to	wait.	He	hauls</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself	 out	 at	 the	 top,	 disappears	 for	 a	 few	 moments,	 and	 then	 comes	 down again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	Mathew,	you	first.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 climbs	 the	 ladder,	 pokes	 his	 head	 out	 at	 the	 top,	 and	 peers	 about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Standing	around	him	are	four	men	in	their	twenties	and	thirties.	They’re	dressed</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	the	bearded	man	in	strange	civilian	clothes.	One	of	the	men	takes	Mathew’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand	and	hauls	him	from	the	shaft.	With	lips	closed,	he	says,	“Hello,	I’m	Tristan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	are	my	brothers,	Bren,	Liam,	and	Kell.	We	still	have	some	way	to	go,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	must	be	quiet.	We	will	speak	only	through	your	e-Pin.	Okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	nods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 other	 men	 smile	 at	 him,	 and	 he	 grins	 back.	 One	 of	 them	 rushes	 to	 the shaft	 Evgeny	 is	 having	 difficulty	 squeezing	 through.	 Lev	 quickly	 explains</p>
<p class="calibre1">Evgeny’s	unplanned	presence	to	the	others.	Once	Evgeny	is	clear,	they	bury	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shaft	under	leaves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	are	immediately	on	their	way,	swift	and	quiet	through	the	undergrowth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	stop	a	few	times	for	Evgeny	to	catch	his	breath.	They	are	patient,	Mathew</p>
<p class="calibre1">notices,	and	not	at	all	critical	of	Evgeny’s	weight	or	poor	level	of	fitness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually,	they	arrive	at	a	cliff	face.	It’s	sheer,	rising	above	them	a	hundred</p>
<p class="calibre1">feet	or	more.	Lev	walks	to	an	outcrop	of	rocks	sitting	to	one	side	of	the	cliff,	lifts some	 leaves	 and	 holds	 them	 up	 for	 the	 others	 to	 pass	 under.	 The	 leaves	 are attached	to	a	rough-fashioned	door,	made	from	wood.	Inside	the	door	is	a	cave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tristan	goes	in	first.	Lev	hangs	behind	to	help	them	all	in	and	then	shuts	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">door	behind	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	stand	in	darkness	for	a	few	moments	while	someone	lights	a	lamp,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	 lamps	 go	 on	 all	 around	 and	 a	 cave	 is	 revealed.	 One	 of	 Tristan’s	 brothers hands	Mathew	a	lantern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	start	to	move	off	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cave	is	low	and	wide	at	first,	the	roof	slanting	at	either	side,	so	they	have</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>to	move	in	single	file	and	bend	as	they	walk.	Their	lamps	cast	strange	phantoms on	the	roof	and	into	the	corners	of	the	cave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Towards	the	back	the	roof	dips.	Tristan	gets	down	on	his	hands	and	knees	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">indicates	 that	 Mathew	 and	 Evgeny	 should	 do	 so	 too.	 They	 crawl	 through	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">narrow	space.	Mathew	thinks	about	the	weight	of	the	entire	mountain	above	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	stone	is	wet	and	cold	where	it	brushes	his	skin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	shuffle	along	for	thirty	feet	or	so	and	come	into	a	much	larger	cavern, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 roof	 high	 above	 their	 heads.	 They’re	 standing	 on	 the	 shore	 of	 a	 large underground	 lake	 that	 glistens	 in	 the	 lamplight	 but	 becomes	 black	 where	 the light	runs	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	to	swim	for	a	while,”	Lev	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	a	wooden	crate	against	the	wall	of	the	cave	on	the	shore.	Lev	goes	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 and	 collects	 small	 mouthpieces,	 goggles,	 and	 headlamps,	 which	 he	 hands</p>
<p class="calibre1">around.	 He	 offers	 Evgeny	 and	 Mathew	 life	 jackets	 and	 helps	 to	 fit	 Evgeny’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tristan	shows	them	both	how	to	use	the	breathing	equipment.	Mathew	puts	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">small	 mask	 to	 his	 face.	 It	 grips	 him	 like	 a	 living	 creature,	 soft	 and	 sucking against	 his	 skin.	 There’s	 no	 strap	 at	 the	 back.	 Taking	 in	 a	 shuddery	 breath,	 his eyes	 wide,	 not	 expecting	 to	 be	 able	 to	 breathe,	 he	 finds	 he	 can	 do	 so	 well	 and fluidly,	and	he	relaxes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,”	Tristan	says.	He	turns	to	Evgeny	and	makes	sure	his	mask	is	secure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay?”	he	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evgeny	puts	up	his	thumb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tristan’s	 brothers	 gather	 the	 lanterns,	 turn	 them	 off	 and	 stack	 them	 in	 the crate.	The	cave	is	lit	only	by	their	wavering	headlamps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ready?”	Lev	puts	on	his	breathing	mask	and	wades	into	the	dark	water.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">others	follow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	water	is	ice-cold.	Mathew	gasps	as	it	reaches	his	stomach,	and	he	has	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">fight	 his	 instincts	 in	 order	 to	 keep	 pace	 with	 the	 others.	 Gripped	 by	 fear	 at	 the thought	of	getting	further	into	the	dark	water,	he	continues	to	wade	and	watches</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	brothers	begin	to	swim	away,	only	the	backs	of	their	heads	visible	in	the	inky</p>
<p class="calibre1">lake.	He	starts	to	swim	out	but	fears	going	beyond	his	depth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sensing	his	fear,	Tristan	says,	“Put	your	head	under	the	water.	Look	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 does	 so,	 and	 he’s	 transported	 into	 a	 different	 world.	 	 They	 are</p>
<p class="calibre1">floating	in	a	cathedral.	Their	lamps	seek	and	illuminate	strange	majestic	shapes:</p>
<p class="calibre1">underwater	 stalagmites	 like	 the	 ruined	 columns	 made	 to	 support	 the	 roof	 of	 a once	great	and	ancient	church,	the	rocks	carved	by	water	and	formed	by	minerals</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	 millennia	 into	 wonderful	 natural	 sculptures.	 The	 water	 is	 fresh	 and	 clear, and	 it’s	 possible	 to	 see	 a	 long	 way.	 Mathew	 is	 stunned	 at	 the	 beauty	 of	 it.	 He treads	water,	gapes,	and	forgets	where	he	is.	Lev	taps	him	on	his	shoulder.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a>others	have	moved	off	and	are	disappearing	into	a	narrow	tunnel	ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	must	keep	going,”	he	says,	turning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	nods	and	follows.	Now	when	he	lifts	his	head	from	the	water	there’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	 a	 couple	 of	 feet	 of	 air	 above	 him,	 but	 beneath,	 the	 water	 is	 a	 vast	 open space.	 The	 tunnel	 widens	 and	 narrows	 periodically	 as	 they	 go	 along,	 and	 then finally	they	stop	and	put	aside	their	breathing	equipment.	It’s	a	dead	end.	There</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	no	more	tunnels	for	them	to	swim	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	bends	back	his	neck	and	is	once	again	aware	of	the	crushing	weight</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 rock	 above	 their	 heads	 and	 now	 how	 deep	 inside	 the	 mountain	 they	 are.	 If anything	happens,	there’s	no	easy	escape.	He’s	starting	to	feel	chilled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lev	speaks	aloud	for	the	first	time,	using	his	voice	for	the	benefit	of	Evgeny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	need	to	dive	and	swim	underwater	for	a	while.	Straight	in	front	of	us,	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	wall,	is	a	lip	and	a	narrow	underwater	tunnel.	Your	breathing	equipment	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">work.	You	have	to	trust	it	and	follow	the	man	in	front.	It’ll	be	fine.”	He	glances</p>
<p class="calibre1">between	Evgeny	and	Mathew.	“Okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 both	 nod.	 Evgeny	 is	 shivering.	 Lev	 takes	 their	 life	 jackets	 from	 them and	passes	them	to	Tristan	and	one	of	his	brothers.	Then	he	dives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tristan	 takes	 Mathew	 to	 the	 wall	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 cave	 and	 pulls	 him</p>
<p class="calibre1">underwater	with	him.	Looking	in	his	eyes,	he	speaks	through	his	e-Pin:	“Breathe</p>
<p class="calibre1">normally	 like	 you	 were	 doing	 all	 along.	 Look	 ahead.	 Resist	 the	 temptation	 to panic.”	He	waits	until	he	sees	Mathew	take	a	few	unsteady	breaths,	then	he	says, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 it.”	 Pointing,	 he	 shows	 the	 way	 to	 a	 tunnel,	 lit	 by	 Lev’s	 headlamp.	 Up ahead,	 Lev	 is	 swimming	 on.	 “Pull	 yourself	 through	 with	 your	 hands,”	 he	 says, indicating	the	stalactites	hanging	down	from	the	roof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	says,	“Thank	you.	I’m	okay.	Help	Evgeny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tristan	nods	and	swims	to	the	surface.	Mathew	follows	Lev	into	the	tunnel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking	 Tristan’s	 advice,	 he	 pulls	 on	 the	 protruding	 rocks	 to	 give	 himself momentum.	 His	 hands	 and	 feet	 are	 numb	 with	 cold.	 He	 hears	 music,	 and	 he thinks	he	must	be	hallucinating,	but	then	he	realises	Lev	is	humming	down	his	ePin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lev	 disappears	 from	 view.	 Mathew	 swims	 after	 him.	 They	 have	 come	 into</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	cavern.	The	water	now	stretches	out	below	and	beside	him	and	far	above</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	head.	Raising	his	eyes,	he	can	see	Lev	swimming	at	the	surface,	silhouetted</p>
<p class="calibre1">against	 the	 light.	 Following,	 pulling	 with	 his	 hands,	 he	 kicks	 and	 then	 bursts through.	Lev	is	there	beside	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take	off	your	mask,”	he	says.	“You	can	breathe.”	Treading	water,	he	helps</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew,	who	takes	a	grateful,	shuddering	gulp	of	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyes	are	drawn	upwards. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a>The	 roof	 of	 the	 cavern	 is	 two	 hundred	 feet	 above	 his	 head	 and	 brightly	 lit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 are	 swimming	 at	 the	 bottom	 of	 a	 cliff	 in	 an	 underground	 lake.	 Water cascades	down	the	rock	side,	the	terminus	of	another	underground	stream.	Ferns</p>
<p class="calibre1">grow	 on	 shelves	 and	 crevices	 nourished	 by	 spray	 from	 the	 water.	 Lev	 swims strongly	to	the	shore	and	wades	out,	climbing	steps	to	dry	land.	He	beckons	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew.	 All	 around,	 lining	 the	 lakeside,	 there	 are	 people	 –	 women,	 men, </p>
<p class="calibre1">children,	young	people,	elderly	people,	people	of	all	ethnicities,	dressed	like	Lev</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 strange	 civilian	 clothes.	 Two	 of	 Tristan’s	 brothers	 break	 the	 surface	 with Evgeny	between	them.	They	swim	him	to	the	water’s	edge	and	help	him	to	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">Mathew	follows	them,	shivering.	A	tall,	bulky	elderly	woman	with	wild,	dyed</p>
<p class="calibre1">red	hair	comes	towards	him	with	towels.	“I’m	Rose,”	she	says.	“You	need	to	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">warm.	Come	this	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carved	 into	 the	 sides	 of	 the	 cavern	 are	 thousands	 of	 steps	 zigzagging	 to higher	 levels.	 They	 provide	 ways	 to	 balconies,	 walkways,	 and	 landings,	 which he	 later	 discovers	 lead	 to	 yet	 more	 staircases	 and	 passageways	 carved	 into	 the rock.	Rose	climbs	steadily,	and	Mathew,	Evgeny,	Lev,	Tristan,	and	his	brothers</p>
<p class="calibre1">follow.	 The	 shallow,	 deep	 steps	 are	 carved	 with	 precision,	 as	 if	 machine-made, cross-hatched	on	top	to	prevent	slipping,	with	high	edges	and	railings	made	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	kind	of	material	Mathew	doesn’t	recognise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rose	 leads	 them	 to	 a	 landing	 and	 then	 into	 a	 corridor	 and	 from	 there	 into	 a cave	or	room	carved	into	the	rock.	Here	there	is	a	steaming	bath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 cave	 has	 tall	 windows	 overlooking	 the	 larger	 cavern.	 Rose	 checks	 the temperature	 of	 the	 water	 and	 then	 says,	 “I’ll	 leave	 you	 to	 it,”	 and	 disappears back	the	way	she	came. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lev	and	the	others	strip	from	their	jungle	clothes,	wash	under	a	shower	to	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">side	 of	 the	 pool,	 and	 then	 get	 into	 the	 hot	 water.	 Mathew	 and	 Evgeny	 step	 in after	them.	Mathew	feels	his	bones	thaw,	and	the	blood	returns	to	his	hands.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">gazes	across	at	Tristan.	He	and	his	three	brothers	are	grinning.	They	reach	across</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	water	and	high-five	each	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	Lev	is	smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome	to	our	home,	Mathew	and	Evgeny,”	he	says. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Tristan	is	giving	them	a	tour	of	the	place	he	calls	the	Theseum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 and	 Evgeny	 are	 wearing	 the	 clean,	 dry	 clothes	 Rose	 put	 aside	 for</p>

<p class="calibre1">“It’s	made	of	a	special	type	of	material	made	partly	from	carbon	nanotubes,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tristan	 explains.	 “Something	 we’ve	 developed	 ourselves	 over	 the	 years.	 It’s intelligent.	 It	 generates	 and	 stores	 energy.	 It	 maintains	 optimum	 body</p>
<p class="calibre1">temperature	whether	we’re	in	the	jungle	or	in	the	cave.	It’s	also	waterproof,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">breathable,	and	lightweight	so	it	doesn’t	get	in	the	way	of	physical	activity.	And</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s	 self-cleaning,	 and	 self-repairing,	 so	 we	 need	 few	 changes	 of	 clothes.	 Our boots	are	hyper-lightweight	but	tough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evgeny	has	been	fitted	with	a	kind	of	e-Pin,	a	clip-on	device	that	sits	inside</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	ear	providing	simultaneous	translation	and	allowing	him	to	join	in	any	silent</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversation.	 Mathew	 has	 already	 discovered	 that	 even	 when	 they’re	 speaking aloud,	 Tristan’s	 people	 use	 mind	 speech	 and	 a	 subtle	 kind	 of	 super-fast	 mind communication,	a	sort	of	inter-brain	emotional	gesturing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tristan	is	now	talking	aloud	in	plain	speech.	“In	this	cave	we	use	geothermal</p>
<p class="calibre1">energy	 for	 heat.	 That’s	 what	 heated	 your	 shower	 and	 your	 bath.	 We’ve	 rigged solar	 power	 through	 trees	 in	 the	 forest	 with	 a	 liquid	 we	 paint	 on	 the	 leaves.	 It doesn’t	 harm	 the	 trees.	 The	 liquid	 contains	 nanomachines	 that	 capture	 energy from	 sunlight	 and	 disseminate	 it	 via	 a	 secure	 coded	 wireless	 transmission</p>
<p class="calibre1">system,	 which	 is,	 of	 course,	 encrypted	 and	 masked	 from	 the	 various	 military populations	that	pass	through.	The	energy	collection	device	is	embedded	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">side	of	the	mountain	and	we	have	a	system	to	route	the	energy	inside,	even	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	 are	 in	 lock-down.	 We	 don’t	 use	 real	 fire	 down	 here	 because	 of	 smoke</p>
<p class="calibre1">pollution	 and	 because	 any	 chimney	 would	 give	 away	 our	 location.	 We	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">ample	water	from	the	underground	supplies,	although	we	use	a	filter.	For	fresh</p>
<p class="calibre1">air	 circulation	 we	 have	 drilled	 vents	 that	 open	 high	 on	 the	 mountain.	 They should	be	hard	to	detect	for	outsiders,	and	they	can	be	shut	as	required.	We	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	system	to	recycle	air	when	the	refuge	needs	to	be	airtight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew,	 Tristan,	 and	 Evgeny	 walk	 past	 an	 area	 where	 a	 group	 of	 men	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">women	 are	 preparing	 a	 large	 meal.	 They	 raise	 their	 eyes	 when	 Mathew	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Evgeny	pass,	smiling	and	saying	hello. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tristan	 says,	 “We	 are	 self-sufficient	 in	 food.	 We	 grow	 a	 lot	 of	 vegetables using	 hydroponics,	 and	 we	 get	 what	 we	 can’t	 grow	 through	 the	 advanced</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>replicators	 we	 have.	 Our	 waste	 is	 recycled	 to	 produce	 fertiliser	 for	 our hydroponic	gardens.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	large	terraced	garden	is	cut	into	a	wall.	The	terraces	are	filled	with	a	brown</p>
<p class="calibre1">water	solution	and	filled	with	plants.	Hanging	above	them	are	sets	of	hot	lamps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 grow	 salads,	 fresh	 vegetables,	 and	 even	 flowers	 under	 high-energy</p>
<p class="calibre1">light.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 climb	 one	 of	 the	 many	 sets	 of	 stairs	 and	 walk	 down	 a	 brightly	 lit corridor	carved	out	of	bare	rock	and	polished	to	a	high	sheen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These	are	my	quarters,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 takes	 them	 into	 a	 simple	 room,	 with	 a	 comfortable,	 neatly	 made	 bed,	 a table	with	a	vase	and	real	flowers,	a	product	of	the	hydroponic	gardens.	Above</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 bed,	 hanging	 on	 the	 wall	 is	 a	 large,	 thin	 Canvas,	 which	 is	 showing	 various images	 of	 rocky,	 dusty,	 arid	 landscapes	 and	 deserts,	 thin,	 parched	 shrubs	 all surrounded	by	aquamarine	waters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 terribly	 nostalgic,”	 he	 says	 ruefully.	 “I	 miss	 home.	 So	 I	 have	 all	 these memory	 images,	 probably	 idealised.	 It’s	 a	 human	 failing,”	 he	 continues. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nostalgia.	But	then,	I	am	human	.	.	.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Memory	images?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	images	on	the	walls	are	made	from	my	memories.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How?”	Mathew	says,	amazed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don’t	 understand	 the	 tech	 in	 detail,	 but	 like	 everyone’s	 here,	 my	 brain	 is connected	to	our	central	computer	system.	Parts	of	my	brain,	mainly	images,	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	downloaded,	if	I	choose,	for	storage	or	sharing,	or	in	this	case,	my	childhood</p>
<p class="calibre1">home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	is	home?”	Evgeny	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“England,	of	course,”	Tristan	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	is	England?”	Mathew	says	incredulously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes	.	.	.”	Tristan	says,	for	a	moment	not	understanding	Mathew’s	horror.	“To</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	 it	 is	 beautiful.	 Of	 course	 .	 .	 .	 you	 wouldn’t.	 .	 .	 .	 I’ll	 let	 Lev	 explain.”	 They leave	 Tristan’s	 quarters	 and	 head	 back	 towards	 the	 main	 cavern,	 pausing	 to observe	it	from	the	stairwell.	Tristan	says,	“We	have	only	been	here	six	months, </p>
<p class="calibre1">so	our	build	is	crude	but	adequate	for	our	purposes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Six	 months?!”	 Evgeny	 says,	 astounded.	 “You	 have	 only	 been	 here	 six</p>
<p class="calibre1">months	and	you	have	built	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	this	is	the	most	basic	type	of	facility	we’ve	made,	but	we	didn’t	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	time	to	do	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	are	others?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hundreds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>“Everywhere	Lev	managed	to	get	to	and	was	successful	in	persuading	people he	wasn’t	a	crazy	man.	He	mostly	failed,	it	has	to	be	said.	He	walked	all	the	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	Britain	to	Tierra	del	Fuego,	via	continental	Europe,	with	some	detours	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scandinavia,	through	Russia,	sailing	across	to	Alaska,	then	on	foot	again	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	the	Americas	and	back	again,	covering	territories	he	missed	on	his	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">down.	 We	 believe	 his	 message	 has	 spread	 further	 via	 people	 he	 met	 on	 his travels	–	he	was	walking	for	forty	years.	It’s	why	we	call	him	the	Pathbreaker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People	not	so	keen	on	him	have	other	names	for	him,	but	you’ll	have	to	ask	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	old	is	he?”	Evgeny	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sixty-five.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	amazingly	fit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	 not	 especially	 youthful	 amongst	 the	 Kind,	 which	 is	 a	 shame,	 because we	 wish	 we	 could	 have	 him	 around	 forever.	 However,	 he’s	 surprising	 healthy, given	 his	 adventures,	 the	 dangerous	 territories	 he’s	 travelled	 through,	 the physical	privation	of	his	journeys,	the	battles	he’s	fought.	A	necessary	evil	in	his line	of	work,	and	more	recently	ours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	the	Kind?”	Mathew	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 what	 we	 call	 ourselves.	 I	 believe	 the	 name	 was	 first	 used	 in	 irony	 by people	 who	 thought	 we	 murdered	 people	 put	 outside	 the	 City	 walls.	 However, we	think	it	accurately	describes	behaviour	we	aspire	to,	so	we’re	happy	to	adopt</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	name.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	are	non-people,”	Evgeny	says	with	a	shocked	expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 say	 Non	 Grata.	 Strictly	 speaking,	 we’re	 a	 branch	 of	 the	 Non	 Grata. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 are	 many	 different	 types.	 The	 term	 originates	 from	 your	 time,	 I	 believe, Mathew.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	is	puzzled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	comes	from	persona	non	grata.	People	not	welcome,	who	are	put	outside; </p>
<p class="calibre1">people	 who,	 as	 Evgeny	 suggested,	 are	 legally	 non-existent.	 We	 are	 all	 people who	 have	 been	 ostracised	 or	 are	 descended	 from	 the	 rejected.	 We	 live	 beyond the	reach	of	the	main	cities	protected	by	government.	We	don’t	live	by	their	rules</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	laws.	We	have	our	own.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you	all	live	like	this,	underground?”	Evgeny	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tristan	shakes	his	head.	“No.	Only	the	Kind	and	those	willing	to	listen	to	Lev</p>

<p class="calibre1">“So	why	do	you	do	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	will	let	Lev	explain.	Come	on,	breakfast	is	ready,	and	there	are	all	sorts	of</p>

<p class="calibre1">oldest,	 is	 nearly	 forty;	 Dom,	 the	 youngest,	 is	 eighteen.	 Only	 half	 of	 them	 are married	with	children,	but	they	still	have	a	formidable	extended	family.	Some	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	smallest	members	 are	playing	under	 the	tables,	crawling	 about	between	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">legs	of	people	who	are	getting	their	breakfast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 rest	 of	 us	 would	 like	 to	 get	 married,”	 Tristan	 says,	 “but	 there	 is	 a shortage	of	women.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Speak	for	yourself,”	Dom	says.	“I	don’t	want	to	get	married.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	the	rest	of	us,	apart	from	Dom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evgeny,	between	mouthfuls	of	muffin,	says,	“There	was	never	a	man	with	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">many	sons.	These	days	a	person	is	lucky	if	he	has	one	child,	girl	or	boy.	Who	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	fertile	man?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evgeny	is	expecting	to	have	some	hulking,	virile-looking	man	pointed	out	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">him,	but	the	sons	all	indicate	the	next	table,	where	their	father	sits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	is	Peter,	our	father,”	Tristan	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 is	 a	 small,	 thin,	 delicately	 framed	 man,	 who	 appears	 far	 too	 young	 to have	 produced	 so	 many	 children.	 In	 fact,	 he	 appears	 younger	 than	 some	 of	 his sons.	His	wife	appears	to	be	considerably	older,	and	no	wonder,	thinks	Evgeny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	father	of	twelve	smiles	at	them	and	raises	his	hand	in	a	half-wave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	 old	 was	 he	 when	 the	 first	 one	 of	 you	 was	 born?”	 Evgeny	 asks, </p>
<p class="calibre1">shocked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dad	was	in	his	early	twenties	when	Gower	was	born.	He’s	sixty-two	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!	You	are	pulling	our	legs,”	and	Evgeny	starts	to	laugh,	muffin	spraying</p>
<p class="calibre1">everywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing	the	sons	say	convinces	Evgeny. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	gapes	at	Tristan.	“You’re	serious,	aren’t	you?”	Tristan	nods,	and	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">sends	Evgeny	into	more	spasms	of	laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>“He’s	messing	with	you,	Mathew.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tristan	shakes	his	head	slightly	and	shrugs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 says,	 “How	 do	 you	 talk	 to	 me	 through	 my	 e-Pin?”	 He	 touches	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">earring	in	his	left	ear.	“You	don’t	have	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 all	 have	 implants.	 They’re	 more	 advanced	 versions	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">communications	 technology	 used	 in	 your	 e-Pin.	 The	 technology	 we	 use	 allows us	to	intercept	brain	signals.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	reading	my	mind?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	 Properly	 reading	 someone’s	 mind	 requires	 a	 more	 advanced	 set	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">technologies	 than	 we’re	 able	 to	 leverage	 reliably	 right	 now.	 Plus,	 there	 are ethical	 issues,	 and	 human	 brains	 aren’t	 yet	 evolved	 enough	 to	 handle	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">psychological	impact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	 intercepting	 the	 brain	 signals	 for	 speech.	 We	 create	 public</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversations	 inaudible	 to	 anyone	 outside	 of	 the	 group,	 or	 we	 create	 private conversations	between	two	people.	It’s	very	useful	in	situations	where	we	need</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	communicate	but	speaking	aloud	would	be	dangerous,	like	when	we	rescued</p>
<p class="calibre1">you.	 We	 hijacked	 the	 more	 primitive	 technology	 in	 your	 e-Pin	 to	 enable	 us	 to talk	 to	 you	 and	 for	 it	 to	 intercept	 and	 transmit	 your	 speech	 signals,	 as	 you experienced.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	you	do	that?	If	I	want	a	machine	to	read	my	brain	signals,	I	need	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">wear	a	synthetic	telepathy	cap	full	of	electrodes	and	a	signal	amplifier.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nano-technology,”	Tristan	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tiny	invisible	flying	machines,”	says	Dom.	“We	sent	them	to	rewire	your	e-</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pin	and	a	tiny	bit	of	your	brain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evgeny	is	stricken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tristan	 says	 to	 Mathew,	 “Implants	 are	 enhancements	 banned	 by	 most</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evgeny	 says,	 “Why	 are	 you	 explaining	 this	 to	 him?	 He	 must	 know	 this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doesn’t	the	ATLAS	government	ban	enhancements,	too?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know,”	Mathew	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“People	 in	 the	 Atlantic	 states,	 or	 ATLAS,	 where	 England	 is	 now,	 and	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Federation	 of	 Free	 Republics,	 where	 Evgeny	 is	 from,	 are	 allowed	 wearable</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology	 like	 yours,	 but	 it’s	 considered	 an	 abomination	 to	 do	 anything	 to actually	amend	your	body.	We	don’t	agree	with	this.	Most	of	us	have	amended</p>
<p class="calibre1">our	eyes	to	allow	us	to	enjoy	improvements	in	vision	and	also	augmented	reality, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 bit	 like	 the	 Lenzes	 you’re	 wearing,	 Mathew.	 We	 all	 have	 biobots,	 like	 you, although	 several	 generations	 more	 advanced.	 Most	 of	 us	 have	 enhanced</p>
<p class="calibre1">cognitive	 functions,	 hearing,	 physical	 fitness,	 mental	 health,	 and	 general</p>
<p class="calibre1">wellness.	We	have	daily	access	to	technologies	across	a	range	of	areas	outlawed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a>in	 most	 of	 the	 so-called	 more	 civilised	 world,	 and	 we	 have	 spent	 the	 last	 forty years	developing	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dom	says,	“Not	all	of	us	need	enhancements.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Frey,	one	of	Tristan’s	older	brothers,	says,	“But	it’s	a	long	story	and	not	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	breakfast.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evgeny	 asks,	 “What	 are	 a	 bunch	 of	 ATLAS	 people	 doing	 in	 a	 mountain	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Russia,	anyway?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	 not	 ATLAS	 people,”	 Dom	 says.	 “We’re	 Non	 Grata.	 The	 Non	 Grata</p>
<p class="calibre1">aren’t	part	of	your	war.	We	don’t	care	about	national	boundaries.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	why	come	here	in	the	first	place?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 were	 escorting	 someone	 on	 a	 journey.	 Then	 we	 bumped	 into	 your	 Mr</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dragomirov,	Evgeny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 are	 the	 maggots	 we	 were	 tracking!”	 Evgeny	 says.	 He	 gawps</p>
<p class="calibre1">wonderingly.	“Do	you	have	the	girl	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	She’s	gone.	She	left	Russia	four	months	ago	with	some	of	our	party.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Left	Russia?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	 crossed	 the	 Bering	 Strait.	 She’s	 now	 in	 ATLAS	 territory.	 She’ll	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">settling	down	underground	like	us	for	the	duration,	and	then	when	everything	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">clear,	 she’ll	 be	 completing	 her	 journey.	 She	 still	 has	 a	 long	 way	 to	 go.	 We’ll follow	her	eventually.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	where	she	is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	using	your	technology?	Your	enhancements?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Partly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	did	you	stay?	Why	didn’t	you	go	with	her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	 distract	 Mr	 Dragomirov	 and	 take	 him	 off	 our	 friend’s	 scent.	 He	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">tracking	us	for	several	months.	We	send	parties	to	take	him	on	long	detours.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">majority	of	us	stayed	here	to	build	this	place.	Mr	Dragomirov	followed	us	to	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">region.	We	were	out	on	one	last	patrol	before	retreating	to	the	mountain	when	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">discovered	Mathew.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	did	you	find	Mathew?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tristan	 turns	 to	 Mathew.	 “We	 came	 across	 you	 and	 the	 big	 cat.	 We	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">watching	when	one	of	Mr	Dragomirov’s	men	fired	his	gun.	We	decided	to	wait</p>
<p class="calibre1">until	the	fuss	died	down	and	made	the	plan	to	rescue	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	asks	Evgeny,	“Why	were	you	chasing	this	girl?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evgeny	 glances	 at	 the	 others,	 looks	 uncomfortable,	 and	 says,	 “Dragomirov</p>
<p class="calibre1">captured	 the	 girl	 a	 year	 ago.	 There	 are	 routine	 tests	 of	 identity	 run	 on	 people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	experienced	them	yourself.	When	these	were	run	on	her,	there	were	strange</p>
<p class="calibre1">results.	Like	you,	this	girl	was	supposed	to	be	dead.	She	was	a	former	citizen	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>an	ATLAS	city,	cast	out	and	deleted.	They	checked	for	enhancements.	She	didn’t have	any	obvious	technology	implants.	She	didn’t	have	a	medibot,	like	you,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">many	 of	 her	 results	 were	 very	 strange.	 Her	 brain	 scans	 revealed	 extraordinary activity,	 and	 her	 body	 seemed	 to	 have	 an	 endless	 capacity	 for	 regeneration	 and self-healing.	Dragomirov	thought	she	was	some	kind	of	highly	secret	advanced</p>
<p class="calibre1">military	 technology	 developed	 by	 ATLAS.	 None	 of	 our	 intelligence	 found</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything	like	this,	but	ATLAS	always	has	the	capacity	to	surprise.	Dragomirov</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	taking	the	girl	to	Moscow	when	she	escaped.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	is	not	military	technology,”	Dom	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	never	thought	she	was,”	Evgeny	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tristan	says,	“Mathew,	I	hope	you	don’t	mind,	but	when	we	were	bathing,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">noticed	you	have	a	dressing	on	your	arm.	You	have	an	injury.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 puts	 his	 hand	 to	 his	 shoulder	 instinctively.	 “Yes.	 The	 cat	 scratched me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Evgeny	says,	“Some	scratch!	We	stitched	it	at	the	camp.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tristan	says,	“Our	father	is	a	healer.	Why	don’t	you	let	him	examine	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 breakfast,	 one	 of	 Tristan’s	 brothers	 takes	 Evgeny	 for	 a	 tour	 of	 the kitchens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tristan	speaks	to	his	father,	who	turns	and	beckons	to	Mathew.	He	smiles	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 approaches,	 and	 the	 three	 walk	 together	 towards	 the	 back	 of	 the	 large cavern,	through	groups	of	people	standing	and	talking	after	breakfast,	and	then</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	a	few	steps	to	a	room	carved	into	the	rock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	floor	of	the	room	is	decorated	with	brightly	coloured	rugs	and	cushions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tristan	stands	by	the	door,	leaning	against	the	frame,	his	arms	crossed,	looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">out,	as	if	giving	them	some	privacy.	Peter	gestures	to	Mathew	to	sit	on	one	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cushions,	and	he	does	the	same.	There’s	music	playing	faintly	in	the	background, </p>
<p class="calibre1">piano	 music	 Mathew	 recognises	 but	 can’t	 name.	 He	 glances	 with	 surprise	 at Peter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	did	you	expect?”	Peter	asks,	and	he	smiles,	his	eyes	sparkling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	smiles	back,	but	he	is	unnerved.	In	spite	of	what	Tristan	said	earlier, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peter	has	read	his	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 close	 quarters,	 Mathew	 is	 able	 to	 observe	 Peter	 properly.	 He	 appears	 no older	 than	 Tristan,	 perhaps	 even	 younger,	 and	 has	 an	 incredibly	 calm,	 slow manner.	 Mathew	 imagines	 he’s	 never	 rushed	 or	 harassed.	 It’s	 relaxing	 to	 be	 in his	company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peter	asks	him	to	loosen	his	shirt	and	take	his	arm	from	one	of	the	sleeves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 examines	 the	 wound.	 Mathew	 peers	 down	 at	 his	 shoulder.	 It’s	 red	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">swollen	around	the	stitches. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>“There’s	 a	 slight	 infection,”	 Peter	 says.	 “Normal	 in	 this	 jungle.	 The	 army doctor’s	medicines	were	not	able	to	cope.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	have	a	medibot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	 medibot	 isn’t	 working.	 Like	 your	 e-Pin	 and	 Lenzes,	 it	 requires</p>
<p class="calibre1">software	updates	and	needs	to	be	connected	to	a	network	to	properly	function.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">shut	 down	 the	 moment	 you	 came	 to	 the	 jungle.	 It	 would	 not	 be	 able	 to	 access modern	Russian	networks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	why	didn’t	I	get	sick	in	the	jungle?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peter	smiles	gently.	“Because	you	have	a	guardian	angel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	is	amazed.	“Did	you	send	your	nanomachines	after	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 Peter	 is	 focusing	 on	 his	 shoulder.	 He	 hovers	 his	 hands	 close	 to,	 but	 not touching,	 Mathew’s	 skin	 and	 closes	 his	 eyes.	 Mathew	 is	 disappointed.	 This</p>
<p class="calibre1">behaviour	reminds	him	of	some	of	the	wacky	healing	videos	his	grandmother	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">always	 sending	 him,	 which	 have	 no	 scientific	 basis	 and	 which	 he	 considers irresponsible.	 But	 as	 he	 sits	 there	 feeling	 slightly	 cheated,	 he	 looks	 at	 his shoulder	 and	 sees	 the	 stitches	 unwind	 and	 disintegrate.	 The	 wound	 actually opens,	and	the	yellow	pus	bubbles	and	then	disappears.	The	wound	is	left	red	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">clean.	 It	 starts	 to	 close,	 and	 the	 split	 skin	 cleaves	 together	 until	 there	 is	 just	 an angry	red	line	running	across	his	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peter	 opens	 his	 eyes,	 peering	 closely	 at	 the	 wound.	 “I’ll	 remove	 the	 scar tomorrow.	Let’s	give	a	tiny	bit	of	time	for	nature	to	help	us,	shall	we?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	.	.	.	how	did	you	do	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peter’s	gaze	is	very	direct.	It’s	like	he’s	delving	into	Mathew’s	mind.	“Don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">look	 so	 worried.	 It’s	 not	 magic	 or	 anything	 supernatural.	 I	 promise.	 We	 are	 all scientists	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	how.	.	.	?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tristan	 says,	 “It’s	 a	 long	 story.	 If	 you	 stay,	 I	 will	 tell	 you,	 but	 not	 now,	 not today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	they’re	still	sitting,	Lev	comes	into	the	room.	He	greets	Peter	and	Tristan</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	says,	“Hello,	Mathew.	How	was	your	breakfast?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Delicious,	thank	you,”	Mathew	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Compared	to	Peter,	Lev	looks	old,	with	his	lined	face	and	greying	beard	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">thick	head	of	hair.	Yet	he	is	fit	enough	to	have	led	a	dangerous	mission	to	rescue</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peter	says	to	Lev,	“Mathew	has	a	lot	of	questions.	I	think	you	are	the	better</p>
<p class="calibre1">person	to	answer	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lev	nods	and	says	to	Mathew,	“Come	on.	Shall	we	have	a	walk?”	He	helps</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	to	his	feet.	Mathew	turns	to	thank	Peter,	but	Peter	is	now	sitting	cross-</p>
<p class="calibre1">legged	with	his	eyes	closed,	apparently	meditating. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>Lev	 and	 Mathew	 go	 back	 into	 the	 cavern	 and	 slowly	 cross	 the	 main	 floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	what	you	expected?”	Lev	asks	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	what	to	say.	What	I	saw	is	not	possible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	think,	Mathew.	How	might	he	do	it	without	violating	the	scientific	laws</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	hold	so	dear?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	would	have	to	be	able	to	control	matter	at	the	molecular	level.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lev	nods	slowly.	“So,	it	is	not	impossible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	may	not	be	impossible,	but	it	is	unlikely.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lev	 raises	 an	 eyebrow.	 “What	 a	 fixed	 point	 of	 view.	 For	 a	 boy	 who	 is	 433</p>
<p class="calibre1">years	old	and	who	dropped	from	the	sky	from	London	into	tropical	Siberia,	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	 strangely	 keen	 to	 hang	 on	 to	 what	 you	 think	 you	 know.	 Are	 you	 able	 to explain	any	of	those	things?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 in	 a	 game.	 The	 most	 amazing	 virtual	 reality	 game	 anyone	 has	 ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">created,	but	this	isn’t	real.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	 you	 think	 you’re	 in	 a	 game,	 a	 simulation,	 why	 are	 you	 so	 surprised	 and concerned	by	what	Peter	did	to	you?	Surely	anything	is	possible	in	a	game?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	frowns.	“The	game	is	so	real,	I	keep	forgetting	it’s	not	real.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	see.	So	I	am	not	real?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 upsetting.	 But	 it’s	 quite	 a	 philosophical	 point	 of	 view.	 Some	 people actually	think	the	universe	is	a	giant	computer	simulation	made	by	the	ultimate</p>
<p class="calibre1">programmer,	 you	 know.	 But	 then	 people	 believe	 all	 kinds	 of	 things.	 It’s	 no crazier	than	gods,	monsters,	or	ghosts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	says,	“How	do	you	think	I	got	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 Mathew,	 I’ve	 no	 idea.	 But	 I	 have	 met	 stranger	 strangers	 in	 my	 time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 I	 was	 young,	 I	 was	 like	 you.	 I	 thought	 I	 was	 rational,	 but	 my	 mind	 and ideas	 were	 fixed.	 My	 life	 has	 since	 taken	 me	 down	 some	 extraordinary	 paths, and	I’ve	learned	to	accept	that	I	might	not	always	have	the	answer.	But	the	Kind</p>
<p class="calibre1">aren’t	in	any	way	a	mystical	group.	As	Peter	says,	everything	we	do	obeys	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">laws	of	science.	It’s	just	the	means	may	not	always	be	transparent	to	us.	What	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 famous	 quote?	 ‘Any	 sufficiently	 advanced	 technology	 is	 indistinguishable from	magic.’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	grins.	“Arthur	C.	Clarke.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lev	smiles	and	nods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	do	you	know	how	Peter	healed	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 have	 explained	 it	 yourself.	 He	 is	 able	 to	 manipulate	 matter	 at	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">molecular	level.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 in	 detail,	 how	 do	 you	 explain	 how	 he	 does	 it?	 Are	 you	 able	 to	 do	 it yourself?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a>Lev	shakes	his	head.	“No.	The	Kind	have	many	advanced	technologies,	but we	 did	 not	 invent	 Peter’s	 abilities.	 They	 were	 gifted	 by	 a	 much	 greater</p>
<p class="calibre1">technologist	we	both	used	to	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	is	he,	this	great	technologist?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	has	other	lives	to	lead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	did	he	go?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lev	 thinks.	 “He	 is	 still	 here	 in	 this	 world	 and	 is	 working	 through	 a	 small number	 of	 people	 like	 Peter	 and	 especially	 now	 the	 Lamplighter.	 She	 is	 his agent.	And	indirectly	through	me,	and	he	is	waiting,	like	we	are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	waiting	for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	 history	 to	 end.	 It’s	 why	 we	 are	 here	 in	 the	 mountain.	 It’s	 why	 I	 have walked	 across	 the	 world.	 When	 we	 emerge	 again	 from	 under	 this	 mountain, </p>
<p class="calibre1">there	will	be	a	completely	blank	sheet,	and	we	will	start	again.	Perhaps	we	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	it	right	next	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	understand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	man	I	told	you	of,	the	technologist,	he	wasn’t	from	the	past	like	you;	he</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Shouldn’t	we	warn	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lev	smiles.	“If	only	it	were	so	easy.	They	will	not	believe	what	we	tell	them, </p>

<p class="calibre1">They	walk	to	the	lake.	Some	children	are	playing,	swimming	in	a	shallower</p>

<p class="calibre1">As	 they	 do,	 a	 man	 surfaces	 at	 the	 base	 of	 the	 cliff.	 He	 has	 come	 from	 the tunnel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People	gasp.	Men	shout.	Mathew	watches	Tristan	and	the	other	brothers	run</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	 to	 the	 lake.	 Frey	 has	 a	 kind	 of	 rifle	 pointed	 at	 the	 intruder.	 Unperturbed, the	intruder	starts	swimming	to	the	shore	with	strong	steady	strokes.	He	stands</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	 it	 is	 shallow	 and	 wades	 ashore,	 his	 hands	 raised.	 Frey	 comes	 down</p>

<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	come	for	the	boy,”	Borodin	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a> <i class="calibre4"><b class="calibre3">28	The	Door</b></i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Lev,	 Peter,	 Rose,	 and	 a	 few	 people	 Mathew	 hadn’t	 met	 previously	 –	 two</p>
<p class="calibre1">priests,	 one	 of	 them	 elderly;	 a	 middle-aged	 woman	 called	 Lilly,	 who’s	 holding the	 hand	 of	 the	 younger	 priest;	 a	 man	 with	 robotic	 prosthetic	 legs;	 a	 youngish man	they	call	Carey;	and	a	grizzled	giant	of	a	man	with	a	nasty	scar	on	his	face</p>
<p class="calibre1">introduced	 as	 Gentle	 Mick	 –	 all	 sit	 around	 a	 table	 staring	 at	 Borodin.	 Mathew sits	to	one	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	shouldn’t	have	the	boy	here,”	Borodin	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	his	fate	we’re	deciding.	He	should	have	a	say,	at	least,”	Lev	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	should	make	the	decision	himself,”	Rose	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peter	 says,	 “I	 think	 Mr	 Borodin	 might	 have	 good	 reason	 for	 what	 he’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">asking,”	and	Gentle	Mick	and	Carey	nod.	“Mr	Borodin	is	somewhat	.	.	.	like	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lev	 is	 surprised	 and	 then	 says,	 “We	 have	 told	 the	 boy	 many	 things	 already, Mr	Borodin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 unfortunate.”	 Borodin	 studies	 Mathew,	 frowning.	 “This	 is	 a	 delicate</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter.	A	mistake	was	made.	A	significant	mistake.	The	boy	shouldn’t	be	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s	 not	 incidental	 to	 history	 –	 to	 all	 our	 fates.	 He	 shouldn’t	 stay	 here.	 To	 be clear,	unless	this	boy	lives	his	own	life	in	his	own	time,	there	will	be	no	Kind; </p>
<p class="calibre1">there	will	be	no	Tekton.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you	will	take	him	back,	to	where	he	came	from,	Mr	Borodin?”	Gentle</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mick	asks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	will	take	him	back.	I	 <i class="calibre4">must</i>	take	him	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peter	 glances	 around	 the	 table	 at	 Lev,	 Rose,	 Lilly,	 and	 the	 two	 priests	 and says,	“Borodin	is	speaking	the	truth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Agreed,”	says	Gentle	Mick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carey	nods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lev	 asks,	 “Are	 we	 all	 comfortable	 with	 placing	 Mathew	 in	 Mr	 Borodin’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">care?	Peter,	Gentle	Mick,	Carey?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am,”	Peter	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me,	too,”	Gentle	Mick	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lev	goes	around	the	table.	They	all	agree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	what	if	I	don’t	want	to	go?”	Mathew	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lev	turns	to	Mathew.	“We	will	get	you	ready.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	only	exit	from	the	mountain	is	through	the	cave	system.	Mathew	stands</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	the	side	of	the	lake,	saying	goodbye	and	thank	you	to	Tristan,	Peter,	his	many</p>
<p class="calibre1">sons,	Rose,	Lev,	and	Evgeny,	who	is	especially	distressed	to	watch	him	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a>“I	don’t	understand	why	I	can’t	go	with	him,”	he’s	saying	to	Tristan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	will	explain.	I	promise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	you	keep	saying,”	Evgeny	grunts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Borodin	 is	 keen	 to	 be	 on	 the	 move.	 Mathew	 is	 provided	 with	 breathing</p>
<p class="calibre1">apparatus,	a	headlamp,	and	a	life	vest.	Borodin	refuses	even	the	breathing	mask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Crazy,”	Dom	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	got	here	alright,	didn’t	he?”	Tristan	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wading	into	the	lake,	Mathew	finds	the	water	more	pleasant	to	be	in,	now	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	wearing	his	strange	new	clothes.	Borodin	takes	Mathew’s	life	jacket	and	dives</p>
<p class="calibre1">first.	 Mathew	 dives	 but	 finds	 it	 hard	 to	 swim	 down	 to	 the	 required	 depth.	 He bobs	up,	unable	to	fight	his	own	buoyancy,	so	Borodin	swims	back	to	him,	grabs</p>
<p class="calibre1">him,	and	takes	him	down	and	into	the	drowned	tunnel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Borodin’s	 headlamp	 picks	 out	 the	 way	 ahead.	 Mathew	 hauls	 himself	 after</p>
<p class="calibre1">Borodin,	 grabbing	 rock	 protrusions	 to	 give	 himself	 momentum	 once	 again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following	the	man	in	front,	he	starts	to	swim	upwards,	and	they	emerge	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">place	 where	 there’s	 a	 foot	 or	 two	 of	 air	 above	 them.	 Borodin	 doesn’t	 wait.	 He starts	to	swim	along	at	the	surface. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 route	 is	 familiar	 to	 Mathew,	 less	 frightening,	 less	 eerie.	 But	 Borodin doesn’t	talk	to	him,	in	his	head	or	otherwise.	He’s	grim	and	purposeful,	urging</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	on,	helping	him	when	he	struggles	as	they	retrace	their	steps	leaving	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mountain.	In	total	silence	they	wade	from	the	water	onto	the	shore.	They	follow</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	cave	and	the	tunnel	to	the	makeshift	door,	and	soon	Mathew	once	again	finds</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself	in	the	jungle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 had	 been	 in	 the	 mountain	 less	 than	 a	 day,	 but	 he	 had	 adjusted	 to	 the comparative	silence,	even	the	bustle	of	the	people	of	the	Kind	being	absorbed	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	cathedral-like	vaults	underground.	Now	the	noise	of	the	forest	assaults	him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">deafening.	The	birds	and	insects	and	unknown	mammals	are	mostly	invisible	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">audible	all	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Borodin	 retracts	 the	 ladder	 and	 shields	 the	 hole	 to	 the	 shaft	 with	 leaves.	 He does	 a	 better	 job	 than	 Lev,	 Mathew	 notices.	 He	 briefly	 wonders	 why	 a	 senior Russian	soldier	would	want	to	conceal	the	whereabouts	of	outlaws. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only	then	does	Borodin	speak,	the	words	crystal	clear	to	Mathew,	though	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">lips	 are	 closed.	 The	 strange	 green	 eyes	 observe	 him	 coldly,	 objectively.	 “We have	 to	 be	 quick	 and	 stealthy.	 Dragomirov	 will	 be	 hunting	 for	 us.	 It	 doesn’t matter	 if	 they	 find	 us,	 they	 are	 trivial	 to	 handle,	 but	 I	 would	 rather	 not	 kill anyone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	thinks	back,	“I	thought	they	were	going	to	die	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a>But	Borodin	just	starts	walking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	hug	the	mountainside.	Mathew	follows	in	Borodin’s	steps	along	a	stony</p>
<p class="calibre1">path.	The	man	moves	with	supernatural	fluid	grace,	unnerving	Mathew.	He’s	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">comfortable	in	Borodin’s	presence	the	way	he	was	with	the	Kind.	They	stop	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 to	 drink	 water	 Borodin	 finds	 for	 him	 in	 the	 heart	 of	 a	 plant.	 Borodin doesn’t	 need	 to	 drink	 and	 is	 patient,	 but	 only	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 he	 seems	 to instinctively	understand	Mathew’s	physical	limits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 higher	 ground	 they	 are	 walking	 on	 has	 fewer	 trees	 and	 less	 wildlife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	recognises	the	terrain.	It’s	the	same	landscape	the	cat	chased	him	into. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 he	 spots	 the	 cave	 and	 the	 gaping	 black	 mouth	 in	 the	 side	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mountain	and	stops	dead	in	his	tracks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Borodin	turns	back	to	him.	“This	is	the	way,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	Mathew	says.	“I’m	not	going	in	there	with	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Borodin	walks	back	towards	him.	Mathew	turns	to	run,	but	Borodin	has	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">–	grabs	him	around	the	waist	and	lifts	him	over	his	shoulder.	Mathew	pounds	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Borodin’s	shoulders	and	kicks,	but	the	man’s	body	is	like	iron,	and	he	has	a	grip</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	a	vice. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">What	has	Lev	done?	This	man	is	the	cat!	He	tricked	them. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 are	 in	 the	 cave.	 It’s	 cold	 and	 dark.	 Borodin	 keeps	 walking,	 gripping Mathew	 to	 him.	 Mathew	 is	 blind.	 He	 is	 terrified,	 certain	 that	 at	 any	 minute Borodin	 intends	 to	 kill	 him.	 Then	 they	 pause.	 Borodin	 is	 reaching	 forward, struggling	 with	 something.	 Opening	 a	 door.	 They	 burst	 through	 into	 the	 light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Borodin	lets	Mathew	slump	to	the	floor	and	turns	to	shut	and	lock	a	door	behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.	Mathew	blinks	in	the	bright	light	and	gazes	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	is	in	Mr	Lestrange’s	Darkroom,	sitting	in	a	chair.	Borodin	has	gone. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Tuesday,	30	November	2055,	London</p>

<p class="calibre1">Looking	around	the	Darkroom,	he	breathes	deeply,	his	heart	still	racing	in	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">chest.	Now	he’s	safe,	he	is	able	to	marvel	at	how	true	to	life	the	experience	was, </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">But	nine	o’clock	on	what	day? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">He	checks	the	date.	It’s	Tuesday,	30	November	2055.	Of	course	it	is!	It	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">game	 he	 was	 playing;	 he	 wasn’t	 away	 for	 days.	 But	 even	 if	 he	 was	 playing	 a game,	 hours	 must	 have	 elapsed,	 surely?	 According	 to	 the	 clock,	 no	 time	 has passed	at	all.	Rising	from	the	chair,	he	walks	to	the	door	and	into	the	hallway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	house	is	in	darkness.	Lights	flicker	on	as	he	moves	around.	Still	no	one	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr	Lestrange?”	he	calls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 door	 to	 the	 library	 is	 open.	 A	 book	 is	 open	 on	 the	 table.	 It’s	 the	 book called	  <i class="calibre4">Fin</i>	 that	 he	 had	 been	 studying	 before	 he	 went	 into	 the	 Darkroom	 and forgot	 to	 put	 away.	 Then	 he	 remembers	  <i class="calibre4">The	 Book	 of	 Mathew	 Erlang</i>	 with	 a shudder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	picks	up	 <i class="calibre4">Fin. </i>	The	page	it’s	open	at	reads:	</p>
<p class="calibre1">Through	 2472	 and	 the	 last	 days	 of	 human	 civilisation,	 Polkovnik	 Grigory	 Dragomirov tirelessly	attempted	to	track	the	Lamplighter	across	Russia	and	into	Siberia.	However,	he was	actually	following	a	breakaway	section	of	the	Kind,	and	the	Lamplighter	escaped	to	the American	continent	three	months	before	Wormwood.	The	breakaway	group,	which	included	Angel Leventis	 and	 Peter	 the	 Sleeper,	 built	 a	 refuge	 inside	 a	 mountain	 in	 Chukotka	 Autonomous Okrug,	where	they	waited	for	the	end	of	history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	streetlights	are	blazing.	The	curtains	are	drawn,	and	he	pulls	them	to	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">side	and	peers	out	at	the	little	street	and	the	row	of	silent	houses.	The	road	is	just as	 it	 was	 before	 he	 fell	 through	 the	 conservatory	 roof.	 It’s	 night-time.	 All	 the curtains	and	blinds	in	the	windows	of	all	the	other	houses	are	drawn.	Above	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rooftops	grey	clouds	travel	across	the	sky.	Stars	twinkle	in	between,	mysterious, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a>far	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Going	over	to	the	shelf,	he	puts	 <i class="calibre4">Fin	</i> back	in	its	place.	It’s	the	strangest	thing he’s	ever	come	across	to	have	self-writing	and	rewriting	books	linked	to	a	game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 trails	 his	 hand	 across	 the	 covers	 of	 the	 books	 until	 he	 finds	  <i class="calibre4">The	 Book	 of</i> <i class="calibre4">Mathew	Erlang. </i> His	fingers	grasp	the	spine,	and	he	starts	to	pull	at	the	book	and then	stops. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">genius	crazy	man? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	sighs.	It’s	inevitable	that	Mr	Lestrange	will	come	home	and	find	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">unless	he	finds	an	escape	route.	In	the	hallway	he	steps	to	the	front	door	and,	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">expecting	it	to	open,	tries	the	handle	once	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	opens.	He’s	free	to	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Standing	for	a	moment,	he	gazes	into	the	ordinary	London	street,	not	sure	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself.	Then	he	steps	out,	pulls	the	door	shut	carefully	behind	him,	and	turns	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	own	front	door	a	few	feet	away.	Standing	there,	he	realises	he	left	the	house</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	a	rush	and	of	course	failed	to	take	his	key	fob	with	him.	Knowing	he	won’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">find	 it,	 he	 searches	 his	 pockets	 anyway.	 The	 back	 door	 is	 open,	 but	 the	 houses are	terraced,	and	there’s	no	way	for	him	to	get	to	it.	He	supposes	he	could	knock</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	Gen’s	door	and	climb	her	fence.	But	the	door	lock	clicks	open	as	he	moves</p>
<p class="calibre1">slightly	towards	it.	Of	course!	The	locksmiths	changed	the	locks.	The	door	now</p>
<p class="calibre1">opens	to	his	bioID.	He’d	forgotten. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	house	is	silent.	Walking	straight	through	to	the	kitchen,	he	pulls	the	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">door	closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	remembers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“O’Malley!”	But	he	doesn’t	expect	his	cat	to	appear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	mother	will	kill	him.	He	closes	his	eyes	and	runs	his	hands	through	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leibniz,	 idle	 and	 charging	 in	 the	 corner	 of	 the	 room,	 wakes,	 alerted	 to	 his presence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	 Mathew.	 It	 is	 late,	 and	 you	 have	 not	 eaten	 this	 evening.	 Would	 you like	me	to	cook	you	dinner?	Your	medibot	says	you	have	a	remarkably	balanced</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a> <i class="calibre4">What	am	I	thinking? </i>	He	catches	himself.  <i class="calibre4">I	haven’t	eaten	since	lunchtime. </i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Then	O’Malley	comes	into	the	kitchen	from	the	direction	of	the	front	room, </p>
<p class="calibre1">crumpled	and	sleepy-looking.	Stretching,	he	lazily	saunters	to	Mathew,	rubbing</p>

<p class="calibre1">A	wave	of	exhaustion	washes	over	him,	and	he	wavers	on	his	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	 you	 not	 feeling	 well?”	 Leibniz	 says.	 “Your	 health	 indicators	 all	 show you	to	be	in	remarkable	health.	Is	there	incomplete	information?” </p>

<p class="calibre1">DAY	TEN:	Wednesday,	1	December	2055,	London</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	 is	 underwater,	 trying	 to	 swim	 towards	 the	 light.	 It’s	 dark	 and	 cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 is	 luminescence	 on	 the	 surface	 of	 the	 water,	 but	 no	 matter	 how	 hard	 he tries	to	swim	towards	it,	it	gets	farther	and	farther	away.	He	needs	to	open	a	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	is	banging	on	the	door,	but	he	is	so	far	underwater	it’s	beyond	reach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mathew!	Are	you	awake?	Mathew!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Waking	suddenly,	sitting,	gasping	for	air,	disorientated,	he	realises	he	is	in	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">bed.	The	bed	sheets	are	sodden	with	sweat,	and	he	has	twisted	them	around	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	his	legs	are	bound	together.	Pulling	them	off	his	legs,	he	swings	his	feet	to	the floor.	His	head	feels	awful.	He	gets	to	his	feet,	staggers	to	the	door,	and	opens	it. </p>

<p class="calibre1">His	mother	says,	“Let	me	know	if	it	doesn’t	go	away.”	She	moves	to	go.	“Oh</p>

<p class="calibre1">O’Malley?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	there,”	his	mother	says.	“He’s	stolen	your	bed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	turns	his	head	gingerly	and	glances	back	into	his	room.	O’Malley	is</p>

<p class="calibre1">Mathew	is	confused.	“I’m	not	sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	horn	sounds	on	the	road.	“Okay,	now	my	driver’s	pissed	off	with	me,”	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	raises	an	eyebrow,	and	his	mother	grins.	“Language,”	he	says. </p>

<p class="calibre1">She	 leans	 towards	 him	 and	 kisses	 him	 on	 the	 forehead.	 “Take	 it	 easy	 today, okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	nods.	She	turns.	He	watches	her	walk	down	the	stairs	and	hears	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">door	slam,	the	strange	sound	of	the	new	locks	bolting	in	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly,	he	makes	his	way	downstairs.	Leibniz	is	in	the	kitchen,	cleaning	up</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Good	morning,	Mathew.	Should	I	fix	you	breakfast?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	sits	down	at	the	table.	“Yes,	please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leibniz	 isn’t	 surprised	 at	 this	 change	 in	 the	 routine,	 but	 then	 why	 would	 it be?	It’s	a	machine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	would	you	like?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hot	rolls.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 lights	 on	 Leibniz’s	 chest	 interface	 flash	 on	 and	 off	 for	 a	 moment.	 “We have	 the	 ingredients	 for	 hot	 rolls.	 Breakfast	 ETA	 four	 minutes.	 Do	 you	 want butter	and	jam?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes	please,	Leibniz.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Coming	right	away,	Mathew.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 Canvas	 is	 on,	 tuned	 in	 to	 the	 news	 channel.	 There	 is	 film	 footage	 of	 a young	 woman	 in	 handcuffs	 being	 bundled	 into	 the	 back	 of	 a	 police	 car	 by uniformed	policemen.	The	headline	scrolling	along	the	bottom	of	the	picture	is:</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Breakfast	is	served,”	Leibniz	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	sits	at	the	table.	“Thank	you,	Leibniz,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	starts	to	eat,	watching	the	screen.	He	increases	the	volume	of	the	Canvas</p>
<p class="calibre1">via	voice	control. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prime	Minister	Saul	Justice	is	being	interviewed.	He	says,	“I	am	sensitive	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 arguments	 concerning	 freedom	 of	 speech.	 We	 live	 in	 one	 of	 the	 oldest	 and most	advanced	democracies	in	the	world	and,	unlike	our	enemies,	we	respect	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">for	 national	 security.	 We	 are	 at	 war,	 and	 at	 times	 like	 these	 the	 people	 of	 this country	 need	 to	 understand	 who	 the	 enemy	 is.	 We	 don’t	 have	 time	 to	 squabble internally.	 If	 we	 do,	 we	 will	 lose	 this	 war.	 Psychopomp,	 as	 many	 of	 you	 will know,	has	a	history	of	leaking	state	secrets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	cannot	afford	to	allow	this	organisation	to	exist	beyond	the	laws	you	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a>I	obey	each	day	of	our	lives.	So	we	are	shutting	it	down.	Reagan	Feye	is	accused of	 being	 a	 member	 of	 this	 organisation.	 She	 will	 have	 a	 fair	 trial.	 But	 if	 she	 is found	 guilty,	 we	 will	 use	 the	 new	 powers	 Parliament	 has	 given	 us	 to	 bring	 the full	weight	of	the	law	down	upon	her	and	any	other	members	of	this	group	we</p>

<p class="calibre1">not	tolerate	traitors	and	dissidents.	We	will	find	you,	wherever	you	are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	journalist	is	flustered	and	disturbed.	The	commentators	in	the	studio	talk</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	 at	 once,	 trying	 to	 explain	 what	 has	 just	 happened.	 Mathew	 turns	 off	 the Canvas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	finishes	his	breakfast	and	allows	Leibniz	to	clean. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	head	is	pounding.	He	goes	upstairs,	finds	his	Paper	and	checks	in	to	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">medibot.	There	is	an	alert.	It	says:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unidentified	 chemical	 disturbance	 prefrontal	 cortex,	 neocortex,	 parietal	 lobe,	 and hippocampus.	 Recommended	 remedy:	 two	 paracetamol.	 Select	 print	 to	 send	 request	 to	 edible carbon	compound	printer	located	in	room:	kitchen. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A	 text	 message	 comes	 through	 on	 his	 Paper	 via	 the	 Blackweb	 network.	 He</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	see	the	news?”	she	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	Briefly.	How	did	they	catch	her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ironically,	 she’s	 the	 daughter	 of	 a	 senior	 politician	 in	 Saul	 Justice’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">government.	 The	 SIS	 put	 surveillance	 on	 him	 to	 protect	 him	 and	 caught	 her accidentally.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	think	she’ll	betray	the	others?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hope	not.	We	live	in	frightening	times.	Have	they	chipped	you	yet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ju	Chen	is	silent	for	a	few	moments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello?”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry.	I’m	shocked	they’ve	done	it	so	quickly.	Are	you	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	feel	a	little	strange	today,	I	have	to	admit.	I	had	an	incredibly	vivid	dream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	know	those	dreams	that	are	so	vivid	they	feel	real?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 was	 extraordinary.	 But	 I	 can’t	 remember	 it.	 It’s	 bugging	 me.	 I	 played	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a>new	type	of	virtual	reality	holovision	game	yesterday.	I	think	it	has	messed	with my	head.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	keep	telling	you	those	holo-things	are	bad	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	you	do,”	he	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 you	 should	 trust	 your	 dreams,	 Mathew.	 Sometimes	 they	 work	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">mysterious	ways.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 might	 consider	 it,	 if	 I’m	 ever	 sure	 of	 the	 difference	 between	 dreams	 and reality	again.	Things	are	so	weird	here	I	don’t	think	I	know	the	difference.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	need	to	play	fewer	Darkroom	games,”	his	grandmother	says. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	has	worn	Soren	Erlang’s	spare	Lenz	and	e-Pin	ever	since	his	father’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">death.	 Lenzes	 are	 made	 to	 personal	 specifications	 to	 exactly	 match	 eye	 colour and	 retina	 pattern.	 When	 he	 disappeared,	 Mathew’s	 father	 was	 using	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporate	 communication	 equipment,	 and	 he	 left	 his	 personal	 devices	 at	 home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew	adopted	them,	and	for	some	reason,	even	though	it	was	obvious	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">wearing	his	father’s	Lenzes,	his	mother	never	objected.	However,	she	gave	him	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">new	pair	for	his	last	birthday,	to	match	his	own	eye	colour,	with	a	fashionable	e-</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pin.	 Now	 he	 removes	 his	 father’s	 Lenzes	 and	 replaces	 them	 with	 the	 pair	 his mother	had	made	for	him,	peering	into	the	mirror,	into	his	own	brown	eyes	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	first	time	in	two	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Downstairs	he	collects	his	paracetamol	from	the	printer	and	takes	them	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">glass	 of	 water	 from	 the	 kitchen.	 He	 stares	 out	 of	 the	 kitchen	 window	 at	 the garden.	 Finding	 himself	 staring	 at	 the	 garden	 wall,	 the	 one	 separating	 their garden	from	Mr	Lestrange’s,	something	flashes	in	his	head	–	a	series	of	images:</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	blackbird	with	a	bright	yellow	beak.	O’Malley	with	a	bird	in	his	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I	climbed	over	the	wall	last	night. </i>	</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The	conservatory	.	.	. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I	fell	through	the	conservatory! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Running	 upstairs,	 two	 stairs	 at	 a	 time,	 he	 bursts	 into	 his	 mother’s	 bedroom and	 goes	 to	 the	 window.	 Mr	 Lestrange’s	 conservatory	 is	 as	 it	 ever	 was.	 It	 isn’t broken.	His	mind	bends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 bathroom,	 he	 starts	 the	 shower	 running,	 undresses,	 and	 examines</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself	in	the	bathroom	mirror.	His	ribs	are	a	little	more	visible	than	normal.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">tells	himself	he	must	try	to	eat	more.	Food	is	always	the	last	thing	on	his	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 his	 shoulder	 he	 notices	 a	 tiny	 red	 line	 he’s	 never	 noticed	 before,	 like	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a>scratch	or	the	scar	of	a	scratch.	Running	his	index	finger	along	it,	he	has	another one	of	those	flashes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">A	cat, </i> he	thinks.  <i class="calibre4">A	cat	did	this. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	vivid	image	flashes	into	his	mind	of	being	knocked	off	his	feet	by	a	large</p>
<p class="calibre1">wildcat,	being	chased	through	a	jungle.  <i class="calibre4">It	was	in	the	game.	A	game,	Mathew, </i> he says	 to	 himself.  <i class="calibre4">It’s	 a	 coincidence.	 O’Malley	 must	 have	 scratched	 me	 in	 the</i> <i class="calibre4">night. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s	had <i class="calibre4">	</i> O’Malley	on	his	mind	for	days.  <i class="calibre4">	</i> His	head	is	pounding,	and	he	closes his	 eyes	 and	 leans	 against	 the	 sink.  <i class="calibre4">I	 need	 something	 stronger	 than	 the</i> <i class="calibre4">paracetamol.	Maybe	I	will	make	an	appointment	with	Dr	Girsh. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">After	he	showers,	he	goes	back	to	his	room	and	logs	in	to	the	school	register</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 his	 Paper.	 He	 remembers	 he	 initiated	 some	 courses	 on	 quantum	 computing and	security.	It	seems	like	a	long	time	since	he	has	considered	these	things.	His</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind	wanders,	and	he	feels	restless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Opening	 Charybdis,	 he	 logs	 into	 the	 Blackweb	 and	 starts	 a	 MUUT	 session. </p>
<p class="calibre1">MUUT	 is	 ugly	 and	 difficult	 to	 use,	 deliberately	 so,	 he	 guesses,	 as	 he	 starts	 a search	on	military	virtual	reality	programs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaving	it	to	run,	he	goes	downstairs	again,	to	the	Darkroom.	O’Malley	runs</p>
<p class="calibre1">inside	 in	 front	 of	 him,	 straight	 for	 his	 litter	 tray.	 For	 a	 moment	 Mathew	 is confused.	 Why	 is	 O’Malley’s	 litter	 tray	 in	 the	 Darkroom?	 But	 then	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembers	the	locksmiths.	The	locks	did	get	changed,	and	he	did	put	O’Malley</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 Darkroom,	 after	 all.	 O’Malley	 finishes	 in	 the	 box,	 and	 Mathew	 takes	 it back	 to	 the	 utility	 room,	 where	 it’s	 normally	 kept.	 Leibniz	 immediately	 sets	 to work	 cleaning	 it.	 O’Malley’s	 water	 and	 food	 bowls	 are	 also	 locked	 in	 the Darkroom.	The	poor	cat	was	probably	hungry	and	thirsty.	Mathew	puts	them	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 usual	 place	 and	 tops	 up	 O’Malley’s	 food	 bowl	 himself,	 giving	 him	 some enviro-chicken	 from	 the	 fridge	 to	 apologise	 for	 the	 delay	 to	 his	 breakfast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">O’Malley	eats	gratefully.	Mathew	stands	thoughtfully	watching	him.	In	his	mind</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’s	 retracing	 the	 events	 of	 the	 day	 before.	 The	 locksmiths	 came,	 he	 locked O’Malley	away,	and	sent	the	beebot	to	Clara.	Did	he	do	this? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	decides	to	call	Clara	on	the	beebot	and	goes	back	to	the	Darkroom	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	starts	the	control	software	and	makes	his	call.	She	answers	immediately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,”	she	says.	She	sounds	pleased	to	hear	from	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	this	a	bad	time?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	It’s	a	great	time.	I’m	halfway	through	a	music	theory	video	lesson	and</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Sounds	interesting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wish	you	could	take	the	test	for	me	at	the	end.	Do	you	have	video	activated</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Yes.	I’d	like	to.	Thanks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great.	What	are	you	up	to	today?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	you	know.	School.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	studying?	I	probably	shouldn’t	ask.	I	won’t	understand	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quantum	computing	and	security.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	knew	I	wouldn’t	understand	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	sure	I	do,	either,	to	be	honest.	My	head’s	all	over	the	place	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why,	has	something	happened?	You	sound	a	bit	strange.	Are	you	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 have	 a	 cracking	 headache.	 And	 I	 had	 peculiar	 dreams.	 Something	 weird</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Absolutely.	Keep	your	security	guard	on	a	leash,	though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 promise	 no	 one	 will	 wrestle	 you	 to	 the	 ground	 and	 point	 a	 gun	 to	 your head.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“I’m	fine,”	he	says.	“What	is	this	place,	this	Chukotka?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 a	 region	 in	 Russia.	 In	 Siberia.	 My	 model	 will	 be	 of	 the	 whole	 world when	 I’ve	 finished	 it.	 I’m	 still	 geo-forming.	 I	 started	 with	 the	 bits	 closest	 to home.	I’ve	completed	Russia	now,	and	I’m	halfway	through	China.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“My	 main	 project	 is	 to	 run	 different	 climate	 scenarios.	 There’ll	 be	 a	 world where	 humans	 never	 existed,	 a	 version	 with	 human-made	 climate	 change</p>

<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	 no	 idea,	 to	 be	 honest.	 Yesterday	 I	 think	 I	 got	 shut	 in	 Ithaca’s	 house.	 I logged	in	to	his	Darkroom	and	experienced	a	VR	so	real	I	couldn’t	tell	it	from</p>

<p class="calibre1">have	some	friends	investigating	Ithaca’s	network.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	Mathew	manages,	but	he’s	hardly	able	to	think	or	speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	teeters	to	his	bed,	collapses,	and	immediately	falls	asleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	his	dream,	he’s	back	in	Mr	Lestrange’s	library,	sitting	in	an	old	armchair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Borodin	 and	 Mr	 Lestrange	 are	 standing	 on	 either	 side	 of	 him.	 They	 are	 all staring	 at	 the	 table,	 at	 two	 books	 laid	 open.	 Lestrange	 is	 leafing	 through	 the pages. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	what	we	expected,	Borodin.	Who	would	have	predicted	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 was	 pure	 laziness	 on	 our	 part.	 We	 are	 too	 easily	 distracted,	 too</p>

<p class="calibre1">never	being	challenged.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Guilty	of	too	much	play!	What	a	strange	idea.	But	what	is	to	be	done?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 both	 focus	 on	 Mathew.	 Borodin	 places	 his	 huge	 hand	 on	 the	 top	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mathew’s	 head.	 “We	 can’t	 go	 delving	 around	 too	 much	 inside	 here.	 If	 we</p>
<p class="calibre1">remove	what	we	don’t	want,	we	may	accidentally	delete	what	we	want	to	keep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	true,	so	true.	Such	a	simple	structure,	but	there’s	so	much	that	could	go</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrong.	It’s	so	fragile!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	to	be	careful	with	it.	He’s	had	headaches	all	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	agree.	We	agree.	We	all	agree.	Now	we’re	involved,	we	have	to	be	careful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	then,	the	dream	scenario?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’ll	have	to	do.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">Mathew	sits	down	on	the	sofa.	Clara	takes	her	seat	at	the	piano. </p>

<p class="calibre1">DAY	ELEVEN:		Thursday,	1	December	2055,	London,	England</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eva	Aslanova!”	he	shouts.	“Eva,	if	you	can	hear	me,	I	badly	need	a	door!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 roaring	 column	 of	 furnace-hot	 flame	 blasts	 the	 tree	 for	 five,	 ten,	 fifteen, twenty	 seconds	 –	 leaves,	 bark,	 branches,	 and	 trunk	 all	 igniting	 and	 burning ferociously.	 Mathew,	 scrabbling	 and	 clinging	 precariously	 to	 the	 higher</p>
<p class="calibre1">branches,	feels	the	heat	blast	towards	him,	toasting	the	soles	of	his	dangling	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	tree	slumps	and	gives	beneath	him.	He’s	falling.	Then	somehow	he’s	on	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">feet.	Yet	another	in	a	series	of	near-death	experiences	survived,	he	knows,	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">due	to	the	fact	that	in	this	world	his	body	is	an	avatar.	Presumably,	Eva	doesn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	 the	 need	 to	 programme	 into	 his	 virtual	 self	 the	 means	 to	 die	 a	 hundred horrible	 different	 ways,	 mostly	 by	 fire.	 She	 thinks	 his	 project	 childish.	 She wouldn’t	have	put	that	much	effort	into	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or	so	he	hopes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	gets	up	from	the	scorched	and	smouldering	earth	beside	the	tree	and	gives</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself	a	moment	to	glance	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	dragons,	as	tall	as	London	double-decker	buses,	shift	on	their	feet,	flex</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	claws,	flick	their	long,	serpent-like	tails	ridged	with	spikes	and	plates.	The power	of	a	tail-swipe	brings	another	tree	crashing	to	the	ground.	It	gets	skewered</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	a	cluster	of	spines,	and	the	dragon	thrashes	its	tail	around	until	the	tree,	now</p>
<p class="calibre1">uprooted	and	spraying	earth	and	rocks	and	bird’s	nests,	is	pulled	loose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	are	trashing	Eva’s	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	larger	dragon	 belches,	and	smoke	 billows	out	of	 her	enormous	nostrils. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	male	yawns,	displaying	a	mouth	full	of	splinter-sharp	white	teeth	the	size	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">large	 bottles	 and	 the	 blue	 tongue	 Mathew	 had	 been	 particularly	 proud	 of	 when he’d	designed	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	have	grown	enormously.	They	are	huge.	And	now,	completely	oblivious</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	fact	that	he	created	them	in	the	first	place,	they	think	he	is	dinner,	and	they are	very	hungry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	is	fairly	sure	that	he	can’t	die	in	Eva’s	world,	but	just	in	case,	he	runs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	is	dodging	trees	as	he	goes,	stumbling	over	tree	roots.	A	hot	blast	of	air</p>
<p class="calibre1">funnels	past	him	with	such	force	that	it	blows	him	sideways.	He	dares	not	stop	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">look,	but	as	he	steadies	himself,	the	rough	bark	of	a	redwood	scraping	the	skin</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	palm	of	his	hand,	out	of	his	peripheral	vision	he	catches	the	image	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">red	glowing	cindered	tree	crumbling	into	a	pile	of	charcoal	and	ash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Up	ahead,	on	the	crest	of	a	small	bank,	is	an	unusually	large	trunk,	the	width</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p186"></a>of	several	men	standing	shoulder	to	shoulder.	In	front	of	the	tree	he	sees	a	young woman	 with	 very	 straight,	 thin,	 white-blonde	 hair	 and	 paper-white	 skin.	 She’s small	anyway,	but	she	seems	tiny,	dwarfed	by	the	giant	conifer.	Behind	her	is	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eva!”	he	gasps,	lurching	forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 scrambles	 up	 the	 bank,	 yanking	 at	 saplings	 to	 pull	 himself	 up,	 his	 feet slipping	on	the	loose	earth	and	stones.	His	leg	muscles	are	burning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	god!”	he	wheezes,	bent	over	double	before	her,	grasping	his	knees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	grabs	him,	pulls	him	inside	the	tree,	and	shuts	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s	back	in	his	Darkroom.	The	blackened	bare	walls	and	floor	seem	less	real</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	the	forest.	He	sits	down	heavily	in	the	chair	behind	him,	still	catching	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">breath.	In	a	large	armchair	in	front	of	him,	Eva	is	curled	up	in	her	pyjamas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 do	 realise	 it’s	 four	 hours	 ahead	 here?”	 she	 says.	 “Bedtime.	 You	 were lucky	 you	 caught	 me.	 I	 was	 just	 brushing	 my	 teeth.	 Fifteen	 minutes	 later,	 I’d have	been	asleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hope	I	didn’t	get	you	into	trouble	with	your	dad?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	no,	don’t	worry.	He’s	not	here.	Off	again	on	his	travels,	immortalising</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	story	of	our	great	and	glorious	army	to	anyone	who	will	listen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“St	Petersburg	again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“St	Petersburg	is	done	and	dusted.	Not	sure	where	this	time.	He	wouldn’t	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	doubt,	we’ll	see	it	all	on	the	news	soon	enough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	sure	you’re	safe	talking	to	me	like	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	safe	as	anyone	is	these	days.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	not	very	reassuring.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Best	I	can	do.	Look,	Mathew,	I	think	we	need	to	talk	about	these	dragons.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	turning	out	quite	as	I’d	planned.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	well,	that’s	what’s	confusing	me.	How	did	you	plan	it,	exactly?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	sure	I	did	that	much,	to	be	honest.	Beyond	getting	them	into	a	world</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	they	could	evolve.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 in	 your	 programming,	 what	 did	 evolution	 consist	 of	 exactly?	 Growing</p>
<p class="calibre1">endlessly	larger?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	are	quite	big,	aren’t	they?	They	should	stop,	though.	I	made	them	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	was	dragon	size.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	is?	Forgive	me,	I’ve	never	seen	a	dragon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	you	must	have,	in	films.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	watch	those	kinds	of	films.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About	twice	the	size	of	a	large	dinosaur.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right.	Why	did	you	do	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p187"></a>“Because	I	could?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	I	mean	is,	what	are	you	trying	to	achieve	with	this	project?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	just	trying	to	make	dragons,	using	the	new	genetic	coding	programme</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 had.	 And	 I	 wanted	 them	 to	 be	 able	 to	 interact	 with	 their	 environment	 and evolve	their	behaviour	over	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	succeeded.	Congratulations.	So	we	can	close	the	server	down	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	They	were	meant	to	breed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	can	breed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 want	 more	 of	 those	 things	 crawling	 about	 in	 that	 virtual	 earth	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">yours?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Obviously,	I	don’t	now,	but	when	I	coded	them,	I	did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow.	I	don’t	wish	to	put	a	downer	on	things,	but	a	few	more	of	those	things</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	you	won’t	have	much	virtual	earth	left.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	seems	a	bit	.	.	.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pointless	.	.	.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can	still	code	them,	can’t	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	sure.	I	packaged	them.	Doesn’t	that	seal	off	the	creation?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	go	back	to	the	source	code,	amend,	repackage,	and	then	redeploy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Won’t	that	overwrite	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	will	kill	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	 not	 alive,	 Mathew.	 Besides,	 they	 are	 fairly	 unpleasant,	 destructive creatures	the	way	they	are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	suppose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	you	have	a	think	about	how	you	might	make	their	behaviour	a	bit</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	interesting,	rather	than	just	predatory	and	destructive?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Such	as?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	 instance,	 if	 I	 was	 interested	 in	 creating	 fauna-type	 programmes	 rather than	creating	worlds,	I	wouldn’t	be	interested	in	making	stupid	animals.	I	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	if	I	could	make	a	mind	more	interesting	and	better	than	a	human	mind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	the	best	and	brightest	scientists	alive	aren’t	able	to	do	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	how	on	earth	am	I	meant	to	do	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mathew,	I	thought	you	and	I	were	training	to	be	the	next	generation	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">best	and	brightest	scientists.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p188"></a><img src="index-188_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh-huh.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shouldn’t	we	be	cleverer	than	the	last	generation?	Shouldn’t	we	be	able	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	things	they	can’t?	Shouldn’t	we	at	least	be	trying	to	do	those	things?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	never	thought	of	it	like	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	father	is	always	saying	that	the	West	is	degenerate,	and	your	schools	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">universities	aren’t	a	patch	on	ours.	I’m	always	arguing	with	him	that	he	doesn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">know	what	he’s	talking	about.	Please	don’t	let	him	be	right.	Look,	why	don’t	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 least	 try	 and	 concentrate	 on	 improving	 the	 dragons’	 minds	 and	 behaviour? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Give	 them	 some	 higher	 reasoning,	 a	 personality,	 even?	 You	 must	 have	 done</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	personality-typing	courses?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	but	I	hated	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	a	surprise.	Anyway,	what	do	I	know?	They’re	your	dragons,	and	it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	world,	for	however	long	it	takes	them	to	burn	everything	to	a	cinder.	Next</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	you	decide	to	go	in	there,	can	you	make	sure	you	check	the	time	difference, </p>
<p class="calibre1">though?”	 Eva	 yawns.	 “You	 wouldn’t	 want	 to	 be	 toasted	 while	 I’m	 asleep.	 It could	be	an	uncomfortable	eight	hours.	I’m	off	to	bed.	Night,	Mathew.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Night,	Eva.	And	thanks,”	he	says,	but	the	armchair	has	gone. </p>
