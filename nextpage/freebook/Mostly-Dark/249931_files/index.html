<p class="calibre1">This	book	is	dedicated	to	me	-	to	prove	to	myself 	that	I	can	do	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">And	also	to	you,	to	prove	that	you	can	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p5"></a>Note	from	the	Author</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Mostly	Dark,	A	Collection	of 	Small	Pieces,	is	a	compilation	of 	Flash	Fiction	tales	I have	written	over	the	last	five	years.	A	few	of 	them	have	been	published	in	online ezines	 or	 journals,	 but	 the	 majority	 of 	 them	 have	 been	 written	 for	 weekly	 online Flash	Fiction	contests	I	have	taken	part	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 title	 reflects	 the	 genre	 of 	 the	 tales	 herein:	 most	 of 	 them	 are	 dark	 or disturbing	in	some	way,	but	some	are	less	so,	and	a	handful	are	even	heartwarming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus,	I	have	categorised	them	like	the	phases	of 	the	moon:	waxing	and	waning, with	the	darkness	of 	the	new	moon	at	either	end,	and	the	brightness	of 	the	full moon	in	the	middle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many	people	ask	me	why	I	write	what	I	do,	but	all	I	can	say	is	that	I	write	what comes,	whether	inspired	by	a	tune,	an	image	or	an	idea.	It	rushes	out	of 	my	head onto	the	page	and	dictates	how	it	will	be	written.	As	most	writers	know,	we	don’t get	a	lot	of 	say	in	it;	we	can	only	tweak	it	once	it	has	arrived. </p>

<p class="calibre1">I	had	been	at	it	for	ages	and	managed	the	difficult	bits,	but	my	back	was	aching.	I needed	to	take	a	break.	I	put	what	I’d	done	into	bags	–	careful	to	avoid	any	drips	on the	 kitchen	 floor	 –and	 shoved	 them	 into	 the	 cold	 room.	 I	 made	 sure	 the	 door clicked	shut	afterwards.	I	wanted	to	keep	them	fresh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 took	 my	 time	 washing	 my	 hands	 and	 getting	 all	 the	 blood	 off.	 I	 didn’t	 want anyone	seeing	any	bits	of 	flesh	under	my	nails	–	because	they	would	notice.	They were	like	that	in	the	day	room.	I	put	on	the	kettle	and	waited	for	it	to	boil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking	 at	 what	 was	 left	 on	 the	 kitchen	 counter	 it	 wouldn’t	 take	 much	 longer, but	I	needed	a	proper	sit	down,	so	I	decided	to	take	my	cuppa	into	the	day	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking	hot	liquid	in	there	could	be	risky	depending	who	was	about,	but	it	turned out	there	was	only	Samson	staring	out	of 	the	window,	and	Adele	in	her	chair	by	the telly	rocking	back	and	forth.	It	was	safe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	took	a	seat	in	the	front	row	and	looked	at	the	black	and	white	movie	they	had on	while	I	blew	my	hot	tea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 I	 took	 a	 tentative	 sip	 I	 heard	 a	 scream	 from	 the	 direction	 of 	 the	 kitchen.	 I couldn’t	help	smiling,	I	loved	that	sound.	Then	I	heard	footsteps	running	towards the	day	room.	It	was	Nurse	Clemens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	came	to	a	sharp	halt	at	the	door	when	she	saw	me.	I	smiled	at	her.	She	came in,	 taking	 calm,	 meaningful	 steps	 toward	 me	 until	 she	 stood	 in	 front	 of 	 me.	 She barked	“Hands!”	as	I	knew	she	would	when	I’d	cleaned	up.	I	put	my	tea	down	to show	them	to	her,	but	my	smile	was	a	dead	giveaway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	orderlies	arrived	at	the	door,	their	shocked	state	indicating	they’d	come	from the	 kitchen.	 Nurse	 Clemens	 gave	 them	 a	 brisk	 nod	 and	 they	 started	 towards	 me, grabbing	me	out	of 	my	chair	and	manhandling	me	out	of 	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 she	 changed	 her	 mind	 and	 cried,	 “Wait!”	 but	 the	 sirens	 were	 blaring,	 and they	 couldn’t	 hear	 her.	 She	 grabbed	 the	 shoulder	 of 	 one	 of 	 them	 to	 make	 them stop,	and	stood	in	front	of 	me	again	to	force	eye	contact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	me	Matilda,	who	is	it?	Who	is	it	you’ve	just	killed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 another	 scream,	 this	 time	 from	 the	 corridor	 to	 the	 bedrooms.	 I giggled,	I	couldn’t	help	myself.	I	didn’t	need	to	answer	they’d	know	in	a	minute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	orderlies	resumed	their	wrangling	as	I	tried	to	stifle	more	laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>Dousing	the	Fire</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">John	was	soaked	to	the	skin	and	all	he	could	hear	in	his	head	were	the	lyrics	‘make it	rain’.	It	had	rained	heavily	in	his	life;	he’d	been	blessed	with	so	much.	But	despite the	 present	 torrential	 downpour	 in	 the	 real	 world,	 the	 drought	 in	 his	 personal	 life had	just	begun	and	he	was	getting	ready	to	enter	the	desert. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	could	feel	himself 	burning	already	with	all	the	emotions.	But	there	was	one he	could	put	a	stop	to;	one	he	could	clear	up,	and	he	looked	forward	to	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under	the	light	of 	a	passing	car	John’s	grin	lit	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	arrived	at	the	apartment	block,	John	checked	his	pocket	again	to	make	sure he	still	had	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	night	lights	surrounding	the	building	reflected	the	rain	and	gave	it	a	sinister feel,	one	he	hadn’t	experienced	on	previous	visits.	But	then	he	hadn’t	had	this	plan in	mind	then.	He	smiled	at	the	prospect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pressed	all	the	security	buzzers	to	the	apartments,	except	the	one	he	intended to	call	on.	He	knew	someone	would	open	the	door	without	questioning	it.	Seconds later	 he	 was	 taking	 the	 stairs	 two	 at	 a	 time,	 the	 adrenaline	 giving	 his	 legs	 more strength	than	they	usually	had,	and	in	moments	he	was	at	the	front	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">John	stood	there	breathing,	letting	his	heart	rate	reduce	as	he	thought	about	his next	 move.	 He	 brought	 the	 key	 out	 of 	 his	 pocket,	 but	 knew	 the	 occupant	 better than	that;	he	turned	the	handle	and	found	the	door	unlocked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	dark	inside	and	he	stood	in	the	lounge	listening.	It	wasn’t	long	before	their moans	reached	him.	He	knew	they’d	be	busy;	they’d	been	busy	for	years	longer	than their	lies	had	declared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	took	the	knife	out	of 	his	pocket	and	enjoyed	the	weight	of 	it	in	his	gloved hand.	It	was	one	from	her	favourite	set;	a	Christmas	gift	he’d	spoiled	her	with	years ago,	a	time	when	giving	knives	to	your	wife	was	a	perfectly	normal	thing	to	do	and no	doubts	would	creep	into	your	head	that	one	day	they	would	be	used	against	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	rubbed	at	the	freshly	healed	wound	on	his	ribcage.	He	tried	to	stem	the	pain it	 sparked,	 but	 that	 was	 internal	 now,	 and	 twisted	 up	 inside	 wanting	 to	 scream	 its betrayal.	He	would	quell	it	in	a	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">John	stepped	towards	the	bedroom	door,	the	thick	carpet	soaking	up	the	sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mark	had	always	insisted	on	having	the	best	of 	everything,	never	caring	about	the cost.	Maybe	that	was	why	he’d	been	able	to	do	this	so	easily	to	his	friend,	with	no remorse	–	as	the	sounds	coming	through	the	door	demonstrated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stopped	to	listen	again,	and	like	coals	to	the	fire	his	rage	swelled	at	the	sound, enabling	him	to	believe	his	plan	was	rational. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 turned	 the	 doorknob	 fraction	 by	 fraction,	 using	 their	 moans	 to	 cover	 each</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>movement.	 Then	 he	 opened	 the	 door	 a	 crack	 at	 a	 time,	 their	 writhing	 bodies coming	into	view,	silhouetted	by	the	light	from	the	window.	They	hadn’t	even	had the	decency	to	close	the	curtains. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 movements	 became	 fluid	 as	 he	 rushed	 to	 the	 bedside	 and	 thrust	 the	 knife into	 the	 back	 of 	 whoever	 was	 on	 top.	 It	 took	 a	 couple	 of 	 seconds	 for	 the	 body underneath	to	register	what	was	happening,	long	enough	for	John	to	pull	the	knife out	and	douse	their	screams	in	a	flood	of 	blood	brought	from	a	swift	stroke	to	the neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	soon	as	he	was	done	he	dropped	the	knife,	knowing	the	rest	of 	the	set	was already	here.	She’d	moved	them	in	along	with	the	rest	of 	her	things	after	their	fight the	week	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	left	as	quietly	as	he	had	entered,	shutting	all	the	doors,	leaving	it	as	he	found it	–	well,	almost.	Then	using	the	stairs	again	before	letting	the	rain	wash	him	clean of 	any	residue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only	 once	 he	 was	 on	 the	 plane	 the	 following	 day,	 did	 John	 allow	 himself 	 a thought	about	it	and	acknowledge	the	tremble	in	his	hands.	But	he	would	work	that out	in	time,	something	he	had	plenty	of 	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>Stalker</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Johnson	shifted	his	position	slightly	and	found	the	window	he	was	looking	for.	He fiddled	with	the	focus	on	the	binoculars	and	someone	came	into	view.	It	wasn’t	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	sighed.	Was	she	home?	He	thought	she	was;	he’d	seen	the	limo	turn	up	and	a group	 of 	 glitter	 clad	 individuals	 rush	 into	 the	 house.	 He	 assumed	 she	 was	 among them.	Maybe	he	was	wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 scanned	 the	 top	 floor	 windows.	 Lights	 were	 coming	 on	 and	 people	 were running	about.	Couples	were	pairing	off 	and	he	wanted	to	know	who	she	would	be with. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Movement	 in	 another	 window	 caught	 his	 attention	 and	 there	 she	 was,	 head thrown	 back	 laughing	 at	 the	 guy	 in	 front	 of 	 her.	 He	 looked	 like	 a	 typical	 New Romance	geek;	silver	shoulder	pads	making	him	look	like	something	out	of 	a	badly made	 sci-fi	 movie;	 hair	 lacquered	 into	 an	 elaborate	 quiff.	 The	 guy	 was	 lighting	 a cigarette,	if 	he	wasn’t	careful	his	hair	would	catch	light.	Johnson	smiled.	He’d	like	to see	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 were	 drunk,	 swaying	 all	 over	 the	 place,	 and	 he	 was	 waiting	 to	 see	 if 	 they were	going	to	get	undressed,	but	no	such	luck	as	they	exited	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 pulled	 up,	 taking	 his	 weight	 off 	 his	 elbows.	 Watching	 that	 guy	 light	 up	 had made	him	want	a	cigarette	too.	He	pulled	a	packet	out	of 	his	jeans	and	enjoyed	a smoke	here	on	top	of 	the	world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnson	surveyed	the	city	below	him	as	it	glistened	in	the	night	light.	He’d	been scoping	this	location	out	the	last	couple	of 	days	making	sure	it	overlooked	the	right house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	wanted	her	ever	since	he’d	first	seen	her	in	her	debut	music	video.	It	wasn’t as	 though	 he	 wasn’t	 someone	 worthy	 of 	 knowing:	 he	 owned	 a	 music	 production company.	But	it	wasn’t	a	big	enough	concern	for	her	to	notice.	He’d	found	out	all he	could	about	her,	and	even	though	he	could	access	the	parties	she	attended,	her group	of 	sycophantic	security	guards	wouldn’t	let	him	close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	knew	he’d	tipped	into	the	obsessive	when	he	woke	up	every	morning	thinking about	 her	 and	 fell	 asleep	 every	 night	 with	 her	 image	 in	 his	 head.	 He’d	 started	 to resent	it,	started	to	resent	her.	And	that’s	when	he’d	come	up	with	this	plan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnson	 ground	 the	 butt	 into	 the	 dusty	 soil	 and	 flicked	 it	 away,	 spinning	 back round	onto	his	belly.	Looking	through	the	binoculars	again	he	found	her	downstairs in	the	lounge,	moments	before	the	French	windows	burst	open	and	they	all	came flooding	out.	Even	from	this	distance	he	could	hear	their	screams	of 	laughter	and knew	what	they	were	planning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 reached	 out	 and	 grabbed	 the	 hold-all	 he	 had	 with	 him	 and	 scrabbled	 about</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>inside	with	one	hand.	He	didn’t	want	to	miss	this	opportunity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 saw	 her	 come	 out,	 already	 stripping	 off 	 her	 clothes,	 revealing	 a	 sexy	 string bikini	beneath.	It	reflected	gold	in	the	light	round	the	pool.	He	paused	as	his	hand found	what	it	was	looking	for	and	took	in	the	view	for	a	moment.	He	imagined	his hands	on	that	soft,	supplicating	flesh.	It	was	such	a	waste. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 took	 away	 the	 binoculars	 and	 replaced	 them	 with	 the	 sight	 on	 the	 rifle.	 He found	 his	 target	 easily	 and	 flicked	 the	 safety	 off 	 in	 one	 movement.	 He	 took	 a breath	and	waited	a	second	as	he	saw	her	approach	the	diving	board.	She	jumped once,	then	twice,	and	on	the	third	he	pulled	the	trigger.	It	hit	home,	making	the	dive less	elegant,	but	the	crowd	round	the	pool	loved	it,	cheering	and	thinking	it	was	just the	drink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Johnson	smiled	as	he	beat	his	retreat,	knowing	that	in	a	few	seconds	those	cheers would	turn	to	cries	as	the	blood	surfaced	and	she	didn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	jogged	down	the	top	of 	the	ridge,	more	sure-footed	than	he’d	imagined	and jumped	 into	 his	 jeep.	 Being	 half 	 way	 up	 the	 hillside	 he	 was	 able	 to	 coast	 the	 car down	to	the	tarmac,	keeping	his	retreat	silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If 	he	couldn’t	have	her,	no	one	was	going	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>Drunken	Sailors</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	school	buddies;	she’d	known	them	all	for	years,	and	they	still	went	out together	on	a	regular	basis.	The	fact	that	she	was	the	only	girl	made	no	difference; she	could	party	hard	just	like	the	rest	of 	them.	She	was	one	of 	the	boys.	Although that	night	it	got	missed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	tried	hard	not	to	think	about	that.	She	looked	at	their	sorry	faces	and	tried to	believe	their	remorse,	believe	that	it	all	just	got	out	of 	hand.	But	Jimmy	couldn’t quite	look	her	in	the	eye	and	that	bothered	her.	It	made	her	wonder	and	recall	his eyes	that	night:	the	arrogance	and	the	supremacy	they’d	shown.	How	drunk	had	he actually	been?	There	was	no	telling	with	him.	There	were	nights	you	thought	he	was completely	leathered,	but	then	he’d	say	something	and	you	knew	he	wasn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 she	 had	 watched	 them	 all	 drink	 that	 night,	 watched	 them	 all	 put	 away	 the beers	with	the	vodka	chasers	along	with	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	had	been	the	usual	fun	in	the	local	bar.	Pool	was	their	favourite,	and	they’d	all wanted	 her	 on	 their	 team;	 she	 could	 pot	 anything	 no	 matter	 how	 drunk	 she	 was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	as	always	they’d	moved	to	the	club.	Nothing	unusual	there;	two	of 	their	six had	 gone	 off 	 to	 chase	 some	 skirt.	 And	 then	 afterwards	 they’d	 all	 piled	 round Johnny’s	–	again	nothing	new. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 looked	 down	 at	 her	 wrists	 and	 rubbed	 them.	 Maybe	 the	 courtroom thought	it	was	a	look	of 	humility,	but	it	was	pain.	The	red	embedded	lines	still	hurt even	though	it’d	been	a	week.	The	doctors	said	they	would	eventually	disappear,	but some	days	she	could	still	feel	the	ties	they’d	used	–	those	horrible	plastic	things	you couldn’t	get	out	of.	Something	she	knew	all	too	well	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 was	 asked	 how	 drunk	 she’d	 been	 and	 all	 she	 could	 think	 was,	 ‘it’s	 amazing how	 fast	 you	 sober	 up	 when	 you	 have	 to’.	 But	 it	 hadn’t	 made	 any	 difference.	 She still	 couldn’t	 work	 out	 how	 it	 had	 started,	 who	 had	 instigated	 it,	 and	 how	 it	 had ended	up	with	them	thinking	it	was	a	good	idea.	She	swallowed,	still	feeling	the	gag reflex	she’d	had	to	the	dirty	sock	they’d	stuffed	into	her	mouth.	Another	thing	the doc	said	would	pass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 she	 was	 asked	 to	 recount	 what	 had	 happened.	 She	 didn’t	 think	 she	 could when	she’d	gone	through	it	with	her	lawyer,	but	up	here	on	the	stand	with	them	all there	 in	 the	 room	 watching,	 it	 poured	 out,	 every	 detail,	 totally	 clinical.	 As	 she named	each	of 	them,	describing	in	detail	what	their	turn	had	entailed,	she	found	it cathartic,	 as	 though	 finally	 stating	 it	 out	 loud	 made	 it	 clear	 that	 it	 was	 a	 heinous unprovoked	 attack,	 and	 that	 the	 things	 they	 did	 were	 perverse	 and	 brutal.	 She shifted	in	her	seat,	still	feeling	the	brutality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 asked	 who	 had	 brought	 it	 to	 a	 stop,	 the	 true	 denigration	 of 	 what	 they’d</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>put	 Nancy	 through	 was	 revealed.	 Johnny’s	 mother	 was	 sitting	 in	 the	 courtroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’d	 already	 given	 her	 testimony	 through	 tears	 –	 tears	 that	 her	 own	 child	 was capable	of 	such	horror;	that	she	had	been	the	one	to	discover	it	after	not	liking	the sounds	she’d	heard	from	his	attic	room.	At	no	time	was	there	a	question	that	it	had been	 a	 game,	 Jimmy’s	 knife	 had	 put	 paid	 to	 that.	 Why	 would	 you	 need	 to	 hold	 a knife	to	a	friend’s	throat	if 	it	was	all	in	fun? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	was	relieved	at	the	verdict,	knowing	she	wasn’t	going	to	have	to	see	them now	for	several	years.	It	would	give	her	time	to	recover,	time	to	try	and	find	a	way through.	She	was	still	in	shock	she	knew	that,	the	doctor	didn’t	need	to	tell	her.	She just	wished	the	song	in	her	head	would	stop;	the	one	they’d	put	on	repeat	that	night to	 remind	 them	 of 	 the	 good	 old	 times.	 One	 line	 in	 particular	 kept	 getting	 stuck, along	with	the	image	of 	Jimmy’s	face	as	he’d	mouthed	it	during	his	turn;	‘Way	hay and	up	she	rises’.	They’d	been	more	than	just	drunken	sailors	that	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>Echo	of	a	Whistle</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Jonas	 had	 no	 idea	 how	 long	 he’d	 blacked	 out	 for	 this	 time.	 His	 heart	 raced	 as	 he spun	round	trying	to	see	if 	the	man	was	still	there,	but	all	he	could	see	were	empty train	carriages	sitting	in	the	disused	siding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 shook	 his	 leg	 and	 pulled	 at	 his	 foot,	 but	 it	 was	 still	 wedged	 right	 under	 the track	and	he	couldn’t	reach	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	really	dark	now,	and	the	wind	startled	him	as	it	hurtled	round	the	corners of 	 the	 derelict	 train	 sheds.	 Any	 second	 now	 the	 man	 would	 appear.	 He’d	 chased Jonas	 through	 the	 woods	 and	 out	 onto	 the	 embankment,	 he	 had	 to	 be	 here somewhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 fought	 back	 tears	 of 	 fear	 and	 frustration.	 He	 knew	 that	 crying	 for	 his mummy	 wasn’t	 going	 to	 help	 him	 –	 the	 man	 had	 been	 right	 about	 that	 –	 but	 the images	of 	the	underground	room	haunted	him,	with	its	dirt	floor	and	rusty	metal cot.	 He	 couldn’t	 go	 back	 there;	 he	 couldn’t	 go	 through	 that	 pain	 again.	 The	 very thought	of 	the	man	touching	him;	putting	those	metal	things	near	him.	He	yanked at	his	foot	again	to	distract	himself 	from	the	image. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	escape	had	been	a	stroke	of 	luck	rather	than	planned.	Not	only	had	it	been one	of 	the	rare	days	that	the	man	hadn’t	used	the	equipment	on	him,	but	the	man had	 been	 complacent,	 allowing	 Jonas	 to	 go	 alone	 to	 clean	 up.	 Jonas	 had	 been halfway	up	the	stairs	by	the	time	the	man	had	shouted,	already	running	for	his	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	he’d	almost	made	it,	but	then	he’d	caught	his	foot	running	across	the	tracks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	 been	 too	 busy	 looking	 over	 his	 shoulder	 at	 the	 man,	 wondering	 why	 he’d stopped	at	the	top	of 	the	embankment.	And	then	the	ground	had	come	up	to	meet him:	the	air	rushing	in	his	ears	creating	a	high	pitch	sound	as	he	fell,	and	a	blinding white	flash	as	his	head	hit	the	track. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	attempted	to	reach	his	foot	again,	leaning	on	the	track	as	he	did	so,	and	that’s when	he	felt	it	–	the	vibration.	He	peered	into	the	darkness	and	made	out	two	pin pricks	 of 	 light.	 They	 were	 moving	 towards	 him,	 increasing	 in	 size.	 In	 his	 gut	 he knew	it	was	a	train. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	instead	of 	feeling	panic,	he	felt	calm.	It	was	over;	whether	dead	or	rescued the	man	couldn’t	have	him	anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jonas	 looked	 up	 at	 the	 oncoming	 train,	 the	 lights	 clearly	 visible	 now,	 his	 eyes tracing	 their	 perfect	 roundness.	 He	 waved	 his	 arm	 and	 waited,	 listening	 for	 the whistle,	the	signal	that	they’d	seen	him.	But	it	didn’t	come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	as	the	train	raced	through	him,	he	realised	he’d	heard	the	whistle	earlier	that day	already,	the	blinding	flash	hadn’t	been	his	head	hitting	the	track.	His	foot	wasn’t trapped	anymore.	The	man	was	gone	and	so	was	he. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Paul	laid	the	lace	wedding	dress	out	on	the	bed.	It	still	looked	as	fresh	and	white	as it	had	done	that	day.	He	could	still	see	her	in	it.	She’d	wrapped	it	up	so	carefully	in tissue	paper,	making	sure	there	wouldn’t	be	a	wrinkle	in	it.	He	unfolded	the	sleeves, smoothing	them	out	gently,	and	ran	his	fingers	along	the	edge	of 	the	shoulderless sleeves,	 and	 then	 along	 the	 sweetheart	 neckline	 of 	 the	 bodice.	 He	 loved	 the sensation	 of 	 it	 and	 remembered	 how	 it’d	 felt	 under	 him	 that	 night	 when	 they’d returned	to	their	hotel	room	to	consummate	their	vows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	talked	about	how	she’d	wanted	her	daughter	to	wear	it	on	her	wedding day,	and	how	she	wouldn’t	mind	if 	had	to	be	altered	a	little.	But	there	had	been	no daughter,	or	son,	so	the	dress	had	remained	untouched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paul	was	secretly	pleased;	he	wouldn’t	have	wanted	to	see	any	other	woman	in	it, it	 would’ve	 detracted	 from	 the	 sweet	 memories	 it	 held.	 And	 he	 needed	 those memories	to	hold	on	to	now.	He	had	to	try	and	salvage	something	from	the	ensuing years	of 	pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	the	dress	over,	being	careful	not	to	crease	it,	and	started	to	undo	the tiny	 buttons	 that	 ran	 down	 the	 back.	 One	 by	 one	 it	 opened	 and	 he	 smiled	 as	 he remembered	how	it	had	exposed	her	back	that	night	to	his	kisses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	he	was	done,	he	stepped	back	wondering	how	he	was	going	to	do	this.	He knew	it	wouldn’t	be	easy,	but	it’s	what	she	would	have	wanted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paul	 lifted	 her	 up	 and	 if 	 it	 wasn’t	 for	 the	 dead	 weight	 of 	 her,	 he	 imagined	 that this	 was	 pretty	 much	 what	 it	 was	 like	 to	 dress	 a	 mannequin.	 Her	 limbs	 were	 rigid and	unyielding	now	that	the	rigor	mortis	had	set	in.	He	lay	her	face	down	on	top	of the	 dress,	 managing	 to	 slip	 her	 lower	 body	 into	 it	 without	 much	 trouble	 and buttoned	 up	 the	 lower	 half.	 The	 arms	 proved	 harder	 with	 the	 sleeves	 catching	 on the	puffy	skin,	and	trails	of 	clotted	blood	ruining	the	purity	of 	the	white. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	finished	he	was	sweating	and	trying	not	to	cry.	He	hadn’t	meant	to	hit her	that	hard;	he	had	just	wanted	her	to	stop.	He	had	tried	several	times	over	the years	to	get	her	to,	but	any	attempts	had	only	led	to	more	beatings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	had	started	after	the	honeymoon	with	the	odd	belittling	comment	that	would get	more	hurtful.	Then	the	verbal	abuse	had	followed	along	with	the	odd	thump.	By the	 time	 they’d	 lost	 their	 third	 child	 she’d	 leave	 him	 black	 and	 blue,	 and	 once	 or twice	unconscious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	lack	of 	remorse	that	had	finally	tipped	the	balance	for	him	–	that	and finding	 a	 confidant,	 someone	 else	 who	 understood	 what	 it	 was	 like	 to	 be	 brow beaten,	quite	literally,	by	your	own	wife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paul	never	imagined	it	would	be	in	the	work	place	though.	George	struggled	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>keep	 explaining	 away	 the	 bruises	 on	 his	 neck	 and	 face	 too,	 until	 the	 mumbled confession	during	their	coffee	break.	It	had	been	a	relief 	to	know	he	wasn’t	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	when	she’d	started	that	morning	raking	up	the	same	old	stuff 	he	just	couldn’t do	it	anymore.	And	when	she’d	lunged	at	him	in	the	kitchen,	his	hands	had	reached out	and	grabbed	whatever	was	nearby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 first	 swing	 had	 knocked	 her	 sideways,	 but	 only	 caused	 her	 to	 falter.	 When she	came	at	him	again	he’d	swung	it	at	her	head.	He’d	never	imagined	that	frying pans	could	do	that	much	damage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paul	turned	her	back	over	on	the	bed,	and	looked	at	her	crooked	face	as	he	heard the	 approaching	 sirens.	 He	 wondered	 what	 they	 would	 make	 of 	 all	 this.	 He	 knew he’d	left	it	a	little	long	before	calling	them,	particularly	when	knowing	it	would	take them	a	while	to	reach	him	out	here	in	the	sticks,	but	he	wanted	her	to	be	ready,	it’s what	she	would	have	wanted.	After	all	that’s	what	she	used	to	say	the	most,	wasn’t it?	“You’re	useless	Paul,	never	ready	for	anything,	or	anyone;	you’ve	never	got	your shit	together.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	happy	to	prove	her	wrong	today. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Peter	 took	 out	 his	 penknife	 and	 scratched	 at	 the	 encrusted	 surface	 of 	 one	 of 	 the giant	iron	statues	on	the	beach,	trying	to	see	what	was	underneath.	Only	pieces	of dried	seaweed	and	rust	came	away.	He	wondered	if 	he	would	get	a	large	chunk	off lower	down	on	the	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 crouched	 down	 and	 spotted	 a	 cluster	 of 	 barnacles	 nestled	 into	 the	 back	 of the	 left	 knee	 and	 got	 to	 work,	 pushing	 the	 blade	 up	 under	 it	 to	 create	 some leverage.	But	it	wouldn’t	yield. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rivulets	of 	water	started	to	pool	round	Roger’s	feet	as	he	worked.	He	knew	the tide	was	on	the	turn,	but	in	the	estuary	it	was	slow;	he	still	had	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wiggled	the	blade,	trying	to	get	in	deeper,	leaning	against	it.	A	satisfying	crack sounded	out.	Peter	grimaced,	pushing	harder;	it	wouldn’t	be	long	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	toppled	over	when	it	gave,	the	sharp	movement	sending	him	into	the	water, bum	first.	He	jumped	up	to	avoid	saturation,	and	while	wiping	himself 	off 	looked down	at	the	flap	of 	crustaceans	dangling	from	the	calf,	the	red	water	flowing	from behind	it	catching	his	eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Peter	 bent	 down	 a	 second	 time,	 expecting	 to	 find	 a	 corroded	 hole	 full	 of 	 rust, but	 instead	 he	 discovered	 a	 white	 fleshy	 opening.	 Pushing	 back	 his	 qualms,	 he reached	out	a	finger	and	brushed	the	tip	against	what	felt	like	flesh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	second	he	touched	it	a	rendering	boom	sent	him	reeling	into	an	oncoming wave.	He	flailed	in	the	water	until	an	iron	fist	saved	him.	It	clamped	down	onto	his head	 and	 lifted	 him	 up	 until	 he	 was	 level	 with	 the	 weather	 worn	 visage	 of 	 the sculpture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bright	 glowing	 eyes	 shone	 into	 his,	 expressing	 a	 rage	 that	 made	 Peter’s	 bladder loosen.	And	when	the	mouth	broke	open	and	tiny	creatures	ran	out,	Peter’s	mind spun,	blacking	out	to	avoid	the	view. </p>

<p class="calibre1">That	night	when	Emily	walked	her	dog	along	the	edge	of 	the	high	tide,	doing	her nightly	count	of 	the	statue	heads	as	they	breached	the	water,	she	paused.	Had	she miscounted?	There	seemed	to	be	one	extra	tonight. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>Daf odils</p>

<p class="calibre1">He	blinked	his	eyes	open,	the	crack	in	the	curtain	confirming	it	was	daylight	even though	the	darkness	in	his	soul	hadn’t	lifted.	Within	seconds	his	mind	was	crowded with	the	memories	of 	the	night	before,	the	dancing,	the	laughing,	the	snogging	and later	the	daffodils. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	on	the	floor	and	saw	the	petals	there,	the	yellow	so	vivid	in	the	rays	of sunlight	 pushing	 through.	 He	 followed	 the	 trail	 they	 made	 to	 the	 bathroom,	 her black	and	white	checked	shirt	crumpled	in	the	corner	like	a	marker	at	the	half 	open door,	giving	a	clue	to	what	lay	beyond. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	image	flashed	in	his	mind	and	he	flinched.	He	was	sure	he	hadn’t	done	it;	it had	to	be	his	overwrought	imagination.	It	might	have	been	what	he	felt	like	doing when	she	had	told	him,	but	he	hadn’t	put	those	thoughts	into	action	…	had	he? </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyes	traced	the	frame	of 	the	door	as	he	recalled	her	pleading	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	mean	to,	Jas,	I	really	didn’t.	It	was	just	the	heat	of 	the	moment,	just	a kiss.	Please	forgive	me	Jas,	you	must!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	watch	the	tears	fall	from	her	eyes	as	he	stood	there	in	the	nuddy	by	the	bed, about	to	jump	in,	about	to	fulfil	all	his	desires	and	hers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	thought	he’d	heard	a	whisper	of 	it	earlier	at	the	bar,	but	he’d	laughed	it	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	couldn’t	have	been	his	Linda,	she	wouldn’t	have	done	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 when	 they’d	 got	 home	 her	 sullen	 mood	 had	 kept	 killing	 the	 spark	 he	 was trying	to	kindle,	until	the	crushing	confession	came. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 rolled	 onto	 his	 back	 and	 stared	 at	 the	 ceiling.	 But	 he	 hadn’t	 done	 anything, had	he?	Other	than	show	her	forgiveness.	He’d	filled	each	thrust	with	his	desire	for revenge,	driving	it	home.	Her	moans	had	been	good	moans	…		hadn’t	they? </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyes	betrayed	him	again,	returning	to	the	bathroom	door.	There	was	only	one way	to	find	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	toes	met	the	wooden	floorboards	with	trepidation,	and	they	creaked	his	way across	the	room,	maybe	trying	to	speak	to	him,	to	warn	him	it	wasn’t	a	good	idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	hovered	in	the	opening,	his	eyes	adjusting	to	the	bright	sunlight	reflecting	off the	stark	white	tiling.	He	pushed	the	door	further,	letting	it	swing	open.	Her	kick-pleat	black	skirt	lay	strewn	under	the	basin,	and	her	under	things	were	huddled	in	a pile	next	to	the	toilet.	He	peered	over	the	edge	of 	the	bathtub	and	shuddered.	The long-legged	hairy	spider	might	not	be	able	to	climb	the	enamel	sides,	but	it	could still	give	an	unsuspecting	person	a	fright. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	wasn’t	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	slumped,	retreating	out	of 	the	bathroom	and	falling	back	into	bed,	scuffing the	 daffodil	 petals	 as	 he	 went.	 He	 buried	 his	 head	 into	 a	 pillow,	 relieved	 but</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>annoyed	at	the	same	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	burst	through	the	door,	tray	in	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	I	heard	movement.	I	made	us	some	tea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	peeked	out	from	the	edge	of 	the	pillow	as	she	sat	down	on	the	bed,	his	black and	white	shirt	billowing	round	her	thighs,	but	not	quite	covering	everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	alright,	Jas?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	reached	out	an	arm	and	put	a	hand	on	her	thigh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah	Linda,	I’m	alright.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	not	still	angry	about	last	night?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	I	showed	you	I	wasn’t?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	grinned.	“Yeah	you	did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	hand	crept	up	her	thigh.	“Do	you	need	me	to	show	you	again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	paused,	her	eyes	sparkling.	She	put	the	tray	on	the	floor.	“Yeah,	go	on	then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 she	 snuggled	 under	 him,	 his	 mind	 flashed	 images	 again	 and	 he	 wondered	 if he	would	have	the	nerve	to	make	them	memories	rather	than	dreams	this	time. </p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">She	danced.	Her	hands	slid	down	her	long,	luscious	thighs	as	she	wiggled	her	arse, which	was	tightly	covered	in	a	short	black	skirt.	They	were	all	looking	at	her	-	every single	male	in	the	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 could	 have	 any	 one	 of 	 them	 at	 the	 snap	 of 	 her	 fingers.	 Their	 feet	 tapped with	 the	 beat.	 Their	 bodies	 swayed	 as	 they	 watched	 her	 get	 into	 the	 groove.	 And their	 eyes	 followed	 her	 hand	 as	 she	 slid	 it	 up	 her	 body	 to	 her	 face,	 the	 tip	 of 	 the middle	finger	dipping	into	the	edge	of 	her	mouth	for	a	second	before	she	swept	it up	 into	 her	 hair.	 Her	 eyes	 peeped	 out	 from	 under	 heavily	 laden	 lashes	 to	 look	 at them:	all	the	animals	in	the	house	with	their	tongues	hanging	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 knew	 what	 she	 was	 doing.	 It	 was	 a	 fine	 balance	 between	 a	 tease	 and	 a genuine	dance.	No	one	could	fault	her;	no	one	could	say	‘she	was	asking	for	it’;	she was	enjoying	the	music	and	they	knew	it.	Just	because	she	was	female	didn’t	mean she	didn’t	have	the	right	to	do	it.	But	it	was	a	test	too.	It	wasn’t	the	first	time	things had	gone	awry	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 bouncers	 watched	 too,	 but	 not	 her;	 they	 watched	 the	 dogs	 panting	 and getting	ready	to	hump	–	whether	her	or	any	other	girl	in	the	house.	She	was	setting them	all	off,	even	the	girls,	who	started	to	join	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	drifted	in	through	the	crowded	men	at	the	edges,	feeling	no	shame	as	they started	 to	 move	 to	 the	 beat	 along	 with	 her,	 showing	 what	 they	 had	 to	 offer	 too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	looked	at	each	other	not	the	men.	And	with	each	beat	they	moved	closer,	but not	touching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	held	eye	contact,	turning	every	now	and	then	to	face	another	girl,	enjoying the	freedom	to	show	off 	their	sexiness,	their	raw	feminine	energy,	without	fear	of reprisal,	 without	 fear	 of 	 having	 it	 misunderstood	 and	 taken	 from	 them	 by	 force. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	throng	kept	increasing	until	all	the	women	in	the	club	were	on	the	dance	floor creating	one	writhing	mass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 the	 spell	 was	 broken;	 their	 intensity,	 their	 feminine	 collective	 being	 too much	for	the	raw	animal	lust.	It	stopped	–	some	of 	the	men	even	averted	their	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether	it	was	due	to	sensory	overload	or	something	unsettled	them,	no-one	was sure.	But	the	women	had	made	it	clear	they	didn’t	need	them	–	or	more	than	that they	didn’t	want	them.	They	were	enough	on	their	own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	like	an	invisible	string	being	cut,	the	tension	was	gone.	A	few	men	stepped away	to	find	the	bar.	They	had	returned	to	a	human	state.	Conversation	resumed. </p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Iona	 could	 feel	 the	 ropes	 on	 her	 wrists,	 the	 abrasive	 thick	 thread	 cutting	 in.	 She wriggled	them,	but	knew	she	wouldn’t	get	loose.	The	jeep	jolted	causing	the	hood on	 her	 head	 to	 move.	 A	 glimpse	 of 	 light	 cut	 into	 the	 darkness,	 but	 it	 was	 too fleeting	to	show	anything	other	than	her	own	bare	midriff.	The	man	opposite	her shouted	at	the	driver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	gathered	they	were	taking	her	out	into	the	desert.	There	wasn’t	anywhere	else to	 go.	 She	 wondered	 who	 wanted	 her.	 It	 had	 to	 be	 somebody	 quite	 high	 up	 for them	to	have	snatched	her	from	under	Saeid’s	nose.	Not	many	would	risk	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Iona	knew	she	should	be	scared.	She	had	heard	tales	of 	girls	being	used	for	all sorts	of 	tortuous	things	to	satisfy	the	blood	lust	of 	the	elite,	but	she	couldn’t	help feel	a	little	excited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 being	 sold	 into	 Saied’s	 service	 at	 the	 age	 of 	 twelve,	 she	 was	 tired	 of satisfying	 his	 fat	 sweaty	 needs.	 She’d	 been	 lucky	 that	 he	 had	 waited	 until	 she	 was fourteen	before	taking	her,	giving	her	a	chance	to	get	to	know	him	and	understand what	 was	 expected	 of 	 her.	 But	 three	 years	 on	 she	 was	 struggling	 to	 keep	 up	 the pretence,	especially	since	he	seemed	to	have	lost	the	desire	to	wash	as	often,	instead spending	more	time	gorging	himself 	and	increasing	his	already	bulky	frame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Iona	could	feel	the	inside	of 	the	car	warm	up,	and	the	blackness	inside	her	hood fade	 a	 little.	 The	 sun	 was	 rising	 and	 she	 hoped	 that	 meant	 they	 would	 reach	 their destination	soon.	The	man	opposite	had	started	talking	to	the	driver	again,	but	his dialect	 was	 unknown	 to	 her	 and	 she	 struggled	 to	 make	 sense	 of 	 his	 words,	 only understanding	that	they	weren’t	to	waste	time,	and	something	about	a	ceremony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	felt	the	jeep	slow	and	swing	round	to	a	stop.	She	heard	voices	as	they	came round	to	the	back	and	helped	her	out.	But	no	one	took	off 	the	hood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	felt	sand	push	between	her	toes	as	she	walked;	a	hand	on	her	arm	to	guide her.	She	could	see	the	detail	of 	the	weave	in	the	hood	now	she	was	out	in	sunlight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	it	went	dark.	She	heard	the	movement	of 	material	as	though	in	a	breeze	and felt	thick	carpet	under	foot,	indicating	they	had	entered	a	large	tent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	noises	and	movement	all	around	her,	and	voices	all	saying	different things,	many	that	didn’t	make	sense	to	her.	But	then	one	stood	out,	the	sound	of 	it causing	her	stomach	to	lift	in	a	rush	of 	adrenaline;	a	voice	she	had	only	dreamt	of hearing	again.	The	hairs	on	her	body	prickled	in	response	to	the	low,	silken	tone	as it	spoke	three	words,	“She	is	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	movement	in	front	of 	her	and	her	hood	was	removed	revealing	two bright	blue	eyes	gazing	into	hers.	They	captivated	her	again,	just	as	they	had	done the	night	he	had	come	to	the	party. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>“Tamir,	you	came	for	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	couldn’t	leave	you	there	under	that	fat	pig!”	Tamir	spat	the	last	word,	his	hand coming	up	to	Iona’s	face	and	cupping	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	he	will	come	after	you.	I	am	not	worth	his	wrath.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	not	scared	of 	him.	He	can	not	touch	me.	He	knows	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	Tamir,	he	was	to	take	me	as	his	bride	at	the	next	full	moon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	he	will	be	too	late,	as	I	am	going	to	take	you	as	mine	right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tamir	clapped	his	hands	and	people	rushed	around	them.	Someone	freed	Iona’s hands	while	several	women	dressed	her	in	the	finest	cloth,	grooming	and	cleansing her	as	they	went.	Iona	could	only	watch	in	amazement	while	Tamir	was	also	dressed in	fine	white	silk	robes,	highlighting	his	dark	sleek	features	and	striking	eyes.	Then he	took	her	hand	and	stepped	towards	the	Bedouin	priest	that	had	appeared	at	the far	end	of 	the	tent.	Never	did	she	imagine	feeling	such	joy	on	her	wedding	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>Traceless</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Lydia	ran	her	hands	through	her	hair	and	clenched	the	roots.	Sitting	on	the	edge	of the	bed,	she	looked	out	of 	the	penthouse	windows	at	the	sleeping	city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’d	 done	 it	 again	 and	 she	 had	 no	 way	 of 	 getting	 out	 of 	 it	 now.	 She	 mentally chided	 herself,	 feeling	 the	 frustration,	 knowing	 she	 had	 to	 bury	 it;	 it	 was	 too	 late now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	over	her	shoulder	at	his	sleeping	body,	his	perfect	skin,	the	line	of 	his back,	beautiful	in	the	nightlight.	His	profile	was	perfect	too:	his	lip	line,	his	strong jaw.	 She	 wanted	 to	 savour	 this	 moment	 forever.	 Her	 stomach	 churned	 at	 the thought	of 	what	she	had	to	do	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stood	up	and	went	to	the	bathroom,	splashing	water	on	her	face	and	staring at	 her	 reflection	 in	 the	 mirror.	 She	 studied	 her	 eyes	 for	 an	 answer,	 some	 solution that	would	mean	she	could	have	both,	but	she	knew	there	was	none.	The	question was:	how	was	she	going	to	do	this?	She	took	a	deep	breath.	The	only	way	she	knew how:	without	thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lydia	 returned	 to	 the	 bedroom	 and	 picked	 up	 her	 clothes,	 careful	 not	 to	 wake him.	 She	 went	 into	 the	 hallway	 to	 dress	 and	 took	 her	 keys	 out	 of 	 her	 bag.	 She gently	worked	the	key	off 	the	key-ring	and	laid	it	on	the	entrance	hall	table,	while her	 mind	 ran	 through	 all	 the	 belongings	 she	 had	 here.	 There	 weren’t	 many.	 None she	couldn’t	live	without. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	slipped	her	coat	on,	resisting	the	urge	to	take	a	peek	at	him	one	last	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 soon	 as	 the	 door	 was	 shut	 behind	 her	 she	 ran	 down	 the	 corridor	 to	 the elevator.	 She	 considered	 the	 stairs,	 not	 really	 wanting	 the	 bellhop	 to	 see	 her,	 but when	it	arrived	no	one	was	in	it.	The	universe	was	working	with	her	tonight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	she	reached	the	foyer	there	was	only	the	night	porter	and	he	was	expecting her.	She	glanced	at	him	as	she	walked	past,	and	he	gave	her	a	meaningful	look	as	he picked	up	the	phone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	the	time	she	stepped	out	of 	the	rotating	doors	she	wanted	to	throw	up.	She covered	her	mouth	to	hide	the	retching	sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 cab	 was	 waiting,	 but	 she	 didn’t	 want	 to	 get	 in.	 She	 didn’t	 want	 to	 sit.	 She couldn’t.	She	needed	to	keep	moving	for	as	long	as	she	could.	She	walked	at	high speed	away	from	the	building,	not	really	thinking	about	a	direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Going	back	to	her	apartment	was	out	of 	the	question.	They’d	find	her	and	put her	through	it	again.	She	couldn’t	keep	doing	this.	She	couldn’t	keep	loving	them, watch	them	love	her	back	and	then	set	them	up.	She	didn’t	want	to	do	it	anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	wanted	out	of 	the	loop,	but	no	one	got	out	–	or	so	they	told	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	thought	sparked	in	her	mind	and	she	ran	with	it.	At	the	next	ATM	she	took</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>out	as	much	cash	as	it	would	let	her,	then	she	got	on	the	subway	–	a	taxi	could	be traced.	 Once	 at	 Grand	 Central	 station	 she	 scanned	 the	 destination	 boards	 and found	what	she	was	looking	for.	Even	at	this	time	of 	night	she	didn’t	have	long	to wait,	 and	 by	 the	 time	 the	 train	 crossed	 the	 border	 into	 Canada	 she	 was	 sound asleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Coming	 off 	 the	 train	 she	 rummaged	 in	 the	 concealed	 pocket	 of 	 her	 bag	 and pulled	out	her	Canadian	Citizenship	card.	She	kept	it	on	her	at	all	times,	the	‘just	in case’	she	knew	would	come	one	day.	But	they	didn’t	–	they	couldn’t;	it	was	the	one thing	she	had	managed	to	keep	from	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	there	she	took	a	bus	to	the	storage	unit	she’d	set	up	years	ago,	when	she had	been	someone	else;	when	she	had	been	free	to	make	her	own	choices,	before she	 had	 become	 indispensable	 to	 them.	 She	 changed	 her	 clothes	 and	 her	 hair, grabbing	her	real	passport	and	some	bundles	of 	cash	she’d	stashed	there.	Then	she headed	for	the	airport. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only	once	in	the	air	did	she	breathe	again	and	let	her	mind	wander	back	to	the life	she’d	been	leading.	It	was	no	easy	task	being	an	assassins’	mistress,	but	at	least	it had	taught	her	one	crucial	thing:	how	to	be	traceless. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>The	Deal</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Josie	nodded,	smiled	and	picked	up	another	tray	of 	champagne	to	offer	the	guests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 slid	 through	 the	 suits	 and	 gave	 them	 her	 glazed-eye	 smile,	 just	 repeating	 the same	thing	over	and	over	in	her	head:	‘Not	much	longer,	you	can	do	it.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">When	she	finished	it	was	late.	The	client	offered	to	call	her	a	cab,	but	she	politely declined.	She	told	them	it	was	just	a	short	walk	and	she	would	be	fine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 loved	 the	 city	 at	 this	 time	 of 	 night;	 it	 glistened	 in	 the	 darkness.	 The streetlights	reflected	the	recent	summer	storm,	the	air	moist	and	hugging	her	close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many	wouldn’t	feel	safe,	but	she	did.	She’d	found	her	place	here,	living	among	the millions	of 	other	anonymous	people.	It	was	only	the	work	that	sucked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	hated	having	to	do	anything,	but	money	was	a	necessity,	and	she	was	lucky	to have	found	regular	work.	She	reminded	herself 	of 	that	as	she	passed	those	huddled in	doorways. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 she	 also	 thought	 about	 the	 looks	 on	 some	 of 	 those	 suits	 faces	 as	 they	 had looked	at	her	–	or	more	correctly,	at	her	body.	She	shuddered	as	she	walked.	It	was all	they	really	wanted:	to	touch	her.	And	on	occasion	she	let	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Josie	didn’t	like	to	think	about	it	too	much,	but	after	a	night	like	tonight	she	knew she	would	get	a	call.	She	could	say	no,	but	then	she	thought	about	the	wad	of 	cash that	 would	 be	 handed	 to	 her	 at	 the	 end.	 It	 was	 too	 tempting.	 It	 wouldn’t	 be	 long now	before	she	would	have	enough	to	retire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	had	got	her	into	it,	telling	her	she	could	do	more	than	just	play	hostess	at business	functions.	It	was	always	him	who	called	with	a	request,	having	vetted	the clients	 first.	 And	 she	 would	 do	 it	 too	 –	 for	 him,	 and	 he	 knew	 why.	 The	 thought made	her	smile	as	she	turned	her	face	up	to	greet	the	light	drizzle	that	had	started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	right;	the	next	day	there	was	a	message	on	her	phone.	Just	a	time	and	a place,	she	didn’t	need	to	know	more.	When	she	turned	up	there	were	three	of 	them waiting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	suite	was	luxurious,	and	they	allowed	her	to	experience	it,	saying	they	wanted to	 treat	 her	 just	 right.	 They	 were	 respectful	 and	 gentle,	 even	 bathing	 her	 too.	 She was	able	to	try	out	all	the	rooms,	looking	at	them	from	all	angles.	They’d	also	left out	 the	 money	 on	 the	 ornate	 coffee	 table,	 which	 gave	 her	 something	 to	 focus	 on when	 she	 needed	 to.	 When	 they	 were	 done	 she	 left	 feeling	 more	 liberated	 than normal	 and	 this	 time	 caught	 a	 cab	 home,	 thumbing	 the	 bundle	 of 	 cash	 in	 her pocket	as	she	went. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	it	was	Jack’s	turn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Josie	found	another	message	on	her	phone	when	she	arrived	home,	telling	her	to block	out	the	weekend,	and	she	did	so	with	a	big	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>He	was	waiting	outside	her	apartment	on	Friday	with	the	top	down	on	his	brand new	 red	 Mustang	 convertible	 –	 something	 he’d	 treated	 himself 	 to	 as	 his	 business was	doing	well.	She	climbed	in,	looking	forward	to	the	weekend	as	he	handed	her the	rings	he	kept	in	the	safety	deposit	box. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 just	 a	 couple	 of 	 hours	 drive	 away,	 but	 it	 was	 like	 leaving	 one	 world	 and entering	 another.	 Whenever	 he	 took	 her	 home	 she	 was	 treated	 like	 one	 of 	 the family,	and	for	the	weekend	she	was:	the	daughter-in-law,	the	sister-in-law,	his	wife. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having	spent	her	childhood	alone	moving	from	one	sleazy	foster	home	to	the	next, never	 really	 belonging	 anywhere,	 this	 was	 the	 closest	 she’d	 ever	 been,	 and	 she lapped	it	up,	embracing	the	fantasy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 Jack	 played	 his	 part	 too	 as	 the	 dutiful	 husband	 –	 in	 every	 way.	 Sometimes she	 wondered	 how	 much	 longer	 she	 could	 do	 this,	 and	 sometimes	 she	 caught	 a glimpse	 in	 his	 eye	 on	 the	 way	 home	 that	 said	 the	 same.	 But	 for	 the	 time	 being	 it worked	for	them	and	they	enjoyed	it,	their	own	personal	deal. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>High</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">She	 inhaled	 the	 smoke	 deeply	 and	 held	 it	 while	 he	 desperately	 tried	 to	 make	 her laugh,	prancing	about	the	room	like	a	nude	nymph.	It	didn’t	suit	him,	he	didn’t	have the	 physique	 for	 it;	 he	 was	 too	 skinny.	 Her	 mind	 drifted	 into	 thoughts	 about	 the perfect	 figure	 and	 how	 it	 could	 be	 possible,	 how	 it	 was	 only	 a	 matter	 of 	 refining certain	things	in	your	life.	She	looked	down	at	herself 	and	smiled.	No	matter	how much	‘munchie	food’	she	ate	she	didn’t	seem	to	gain	a	thing.	She	watched	her	chest deflate	as	she	exhaled	and	marvelled	at	how	amazing	the	body	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 he	 touched	 her	 and	 she	 felt	 it	 shiver	 along	 her	 skin.	 Every	 hair	 felt	 the touch	of 	his	finger	as	it	ran	up	her	bare	thigh.	She	watched	as	he	reached	the	top, hovering	as	though	debating	direction,	then	travelling	on	up	her	rib	cage,	faltering at	a	couple	of 	moles	and	circling	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	inhaled	air,	watching	her	ribcage	expand	and	his	finger	going	up	and	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	giggled	and	he	giggled	too,	and	then	they	couldn’t	stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bed	they	lay	on	was	messy,	as	though	they	had	been	there	for	days	…	and	it might	have	been,	neither	of 	them	knew	anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	doorbell	rang	and	they	froze	looking	at	each	other	with	dawning	horror	that there	 was	 a	 person	 out	 there,	 potentially	 a	 non-stoned	 person	 that	 they’d	 have	 to interact	 with.	 Paranoia	 crept	 at	 the	 edges	 of 	 their	 thoughts.	 He	 rushed	 into	 some loose	 trousers,	 half 	 falling	 in	 his	 attempt	 to	 look	 respectable,	 and	 running	 his fingers	repeatedly	through	his	hair	as	he	left	the	room,	shaking	his	head,	trying	to clear	it	and	not	look	quite	so	out	of 	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	heard	laughter	at	the	front	door	and	then	footsteps	coming	back.	Two	heads popped	round	the	door	and	she	grinned;	it	was	play	time.	His	two	friends	started stripping	between	drags	of 	the	joint	they’d	been	working	on	and	crawled	onto	the bed	next	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	 she	 had	 three	 fingers	 to	 watch	 and	 they	 just	 made	 her	 giggle	 more	 and more.	She	slipped	into	the	fuzzy	delight	of 	pure	sensation	and	went	with	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 next	 morning	 she	 came	 to	 and	 found	 herself 	 entangled	 in	 three	 other sleeping	 bodies.	 She	 tried	 to	 remember	 what	 had	 happened,	 but	 could	 only remember	the	smoking,	giggling	and	lots	of 	touching.	She	smiled	to	herself;	they’d fallen	asleep	and	nothing	had	happened.	She	knew	it;	this	wasn’t	the	first	time.	So she	 just	 lay	 there	 and	 waited.	 It	 wouldn’t	 be	 long,	 and	 then	 the	 party	 would	 start again,	but	this	time	with	some	follow	through. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Lily	ignored	his	physical	rejection	of 	her	attempt	at	a	hug;	at	least	he’d	allowed	the peck	on	the	cheek.	She	watched	him	walk	away	hurriedly	to	the	other	side	of 	the busy	train	station,	a	sudden	heaviness	on	her	chest	and	sickness	in	her	stomach.	By the	time	she’d	reached	the	train	there	were	tears	in	her	eyes.	She	missed	him	already. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	day	had	been	perfect,	their	nervousness	diminishing	after	the	first	hour.	He was	 friendly,	 attentive,	 and	 interested.	 It	 made	 her	 feel	 renewed.	 It	 made	 her	 feel there	was	a	chance.	But	now	he	was	gone	again,	with	no	idea	of 	anything	further. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stared	at	her	reflection	in	the	train	window.	He	had	no	idea	how	closely	she’d been	watching	him,	how	much	she	knew	about	his	movements:	the	places	he’d	been to,	 the	 parties	 he’d	 gone	 to,	 how	 many	 times	 she’d	 resisted	 a	 comment	 on	 social media	that	would	give	it	all	away.	But	she	couldn’t	help	herself,	not	where	he	was concerned.	Not	since	they’d	met	at	Joleen’s	party. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily	 stared	 at	 pictures	 of 	 him	 on	 social	 media	 all	 the	 time.	 She	 imagined conversations	with	him,	drinking	with	him	…	sex	with	him.	She	bit	her	lower	lip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	would	that	be	like? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 mobile	 phone	 beeped,	 and	 her	 heart	 leapt	 when	 she	 saw	 it	 was	 from	 him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	 to	 see	 you,”	 he	 said.	 “You	 free	 next	 week?”	 A	 rush	 of 	 adrenaline	 ran through	her,	banishing	all	the	sadness.	She	sent	a	text	back	with	a	simple	“Yes”.	A few	seconds	later	he	responded	with	“I’ll	call	you.	We’ll	set	something	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	waited,	but	he	clearly	didn’t	mean	now.	She	had	no	idea	when	it	might	be,	but she	was	happy	that	it	might	be	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily	tucked	the	phone	back	in	her	pocket. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Roger	looked	at	his	phone,	his	heart	thumping.	He’d	done	it.	He’d	asked	for	the second	 date.	 Had	 he	 been	 too	 casual?	 He	 didn’t	 want	 to	 seem	 too	 keen.	 He	 still shook	slightly	after	her	attempt	to	hug	him.	He	couldn’t	let	her	do	that	–	that	was too	 much	 –	 that	 would	 give	 it	 all	 away.	 He	 had	 to	 keep	 the	 cool	 exterior.	 He couldn’t	risk	her	seeing	what	she	did	to	him.	If 	they	embraced	he’d	struggle	to	let her	go,	he	knew	he	would. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 all	 this	 time	 they	 had	 finally	 met	 up.	 He’d	 scanned	 the	 social	 media timelines	 for	 months,	 for	 any	 mention	 of 	 her	 going	 to	 any	 of 	 the	 parties	 he	 was attending.	 He’d	 waited	 avidly	 for	 her	 to	 ‘like’	 any	 of 	 the	 events,	 but	 she’d	 always been	 absent.	 And	 then	 finally	 he’d	 managed	 to	 bring	 about	 a	 meeting	 –</p>
<p class="calibre1">coincidentally	 been	 where	 she	 was.	 She	 always	 tagged	 the	 place	 where	 she	 went shopping,	so	it	wasn’t	hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>But	he’d	thought	about	it	for	weeks.	Would	she	see	through	it?	Would	she	know? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Would	he	be	able	to	do	it?	Could	he	approach	her	and	pretend	to	be	relaxed	and surprised	to	see	her?	Would	she	respond?	Be	interested?	He	thought	she	might,	but until	that	moment	he	hadn’t	known.	It	had	taken	a	lot	to	get	the	nerve	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 it	 had	 been	 perfect.	 She’d	 been	 in	 no	 hurry	 to	 leave.	 She’d	 been	 happy	 to join	him	for	something	to	eat.	And	she’d	lingered	–	or	had	it	been	his	imagination? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	didn’t	think	so,	not	after	she	attempted	to	hug	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	tried	not	to	berate	himself 	for	his	reaction,	but	he	hadn’t	expected	her	to	do that.	 Not	 yet.	 He	 wasn’t	 ready	 for	 that	 yet	 –	 not	 in	 reality.	 He’d	 gone	 over	 it	 a hundred	times	in	his	mind.	How	he	would	hold	on	to	her,	embrace	her,	and	then kiss	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 stood	 up.	 He	 had	 to	 break	 that	 thought	 process,	 save	 it	 for	 later	 when	 he wasn’t	in	public.	He	looked	up	at	the	board	to	see	which	platform	his	train	was	on, and	started	heading	that	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	when	was	he	going	to	call	her?	How	soon	was	too	soon?	And	what	would	he say? </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	mind	buzzed	as	he	boarded	his	train. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Ruth	pushed	open	the	cabin	door,	inhaling	the	scent	of 	the	thick	foliage	and	fresh wood	 that	 surrounded	 it.	 It	 had	 been	 too	 long.	 She	 walked	 in	 and	 found	 it untouched.	Her	heart	sank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 traced	 her	 finger	 along	 the	 rough	 wooden	 kitchen	 table	 and	 thought	 about the	last	time	they	had	used	it.	She	climbed	the	ladder	up	to	the	eaves	where	their bed	lay.	She	looked	at	it,	still	pristine,	not	a	crease	in	it.	He	hadn’t	been	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sighed	and	made	her	way	back	down	the	ladder.	She	brought	in	her	bag	and put	it	on	the	table.	She	unpacked	its	tiny	contents	into	the	single	kitchen	cupboard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	wouldn’t	be	long	before	she	would	use	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ruth	 busied	 herself 	 with	 preparing	 the	 hearth	 and	 a	 fire	 for	 the	 evening.	 Dusk wouldn’t	be	long,	and	then	she	could	get	to	work.	There	were	a	million	reasons	why he	might	not	be	back,	and	he	could	be	on	his	way.	She	only	allowed	the	questions	to surface	 at	 the	 edge	 of 	 her	 thoughts,	 not	 letting	 them	 in	 fully.	 She	 refused	 to acknowledge	 any	 of 	 her	 nagging	 doubts.	 She	 would	 help	 him	 soon	 enough.	 She refused	to	chide	herself 	for	not	having	returned	sooner.	Things	had	to	be	arranged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	wanted	this	to	go	right;	she	wouldn’t	risk	him	being	taken	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dusk	 fell	 and	 she	 took	 a	 stool	 outside	 so	 she	 could	 listen.	 It	 took	 a	 while,	 but soon	she	heard	it.	She	smiled	to	herself.	She	went	inside	to	fetch	her	tools. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 she	 brought	 out	 the	 array	 of 	 objects	 she	 could	 feel	 it	 coming	 closer,	 the sound	increasing.	Her	heart	was	light	and	totally	open,	as	it	should	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 more	 solid	 sounds	 were	 audible,	 in	 particular	 footfalls,	 or	 were	 they	 hoof falls?	She	wasn’t	quite	sure,	but	it	didn’t	matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	crashing	and	breaking	of 	foliage	moved	closer	until	an	outline	appeared	in the	dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	right,	she	had	heard	both.	He	stepped	out	into	the	clearing,	leading	his horse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 stopped	 when	 he	 saw	 her,	 and	 swept	 the	 helmet	 off 	 his	 head	 as	 though	 it blocked	his	view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	lady,	you	have	returned!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ruth	smiled,	wanting	to	step	forward,	but	knowing	better.	“I	have.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you	reached	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	bowed	low.	She	curtsied	in	response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	will	come.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	stood	there	was	a	new	light	in	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>“Can	you	wait?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	eternity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiled.	“It	won’t	be	that	long	I	promise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	far?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	back	over	his	shoulder,	seeing	what	she	could	not.	“No,	my	lady,	not in	distance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	will	aid	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 remained	 silent,	 but	 his	 eyes	 told	 her	 all	 she	 needed	 to	 know.	 Again	 she resisted	the	urge	to	run	to	him,	knowing	he	wasn’t	really	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	faltered	as	he	spoke.	“I	must	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 started	 to	 turn,	 heading	 back	 into	 the	 woods.	 She	 watched	 him	 go.	 He glanced	at	her	one	last	time,	his	eyes	bright	and	smiling.	It	wouldn’t	be	long,	they could	both	feel	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ruth	remained	outside	picking	up	each	object	and	delivering	its	incantation	until the	chill	bit	into	her.	Then	she	moved	in	by	the	fire	and	continued	until	the	embers burned	so	low	she	could	barely	see.	Eventually	she	climbed	the	steps	up	to	the	bed and	fell	into	a	dreamless	sleep,	exhausted	by	her	efforts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	hear	the	creak	of 	the	cabin	door,	or	the	soft	footsteps	on	the	ladder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	she	knew	the	arm	that	fell	across	her	and	the	body	that	shuffled	up	against	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 scent	 made	 her	 smile	 in	 her	 dream.	 They	 were	 well	 met	 at	 long	 last;	 there would	be	no	more	interference. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Lucille	stopped	in	front	of 	the	subtly	lit	signage,	knowing	it	was	the	place	she	had seen	 in	 her	 dream.	 The	 pull	 within	 her	 was	 strong;	 the	 excitement	 in	 her	 core peaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	entered	the	club	and	no	one	at	the	door	batted	an	eyelid.	When	shown	the card	at	the	cloakrooms	she	knew	she	was	in	the	right	place;	the	image	on	the	other side	burned	in	her	mind.	Her	response	was	met	with	a	quick	nod	and	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	she	walked	inside,	the	music	made	her	feel	like	she	had	walked	into	a	time warp;	its	single	note	filling	the	room.	The	people	stood	around	as	though	waiting for	something	and	for	a	moment	she	wondered	if 	it	was	her.	Then	the	beat	started and	the	dancing	resumed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 she	 approached	 the	 bar,	 she	 was	 handed	 a	 drink.	 She	 sipped	 it	 and delighted	 in	 its	 accuracy.	 Speech	 was	 rendered	 useless	 here,	 allowing	 the	 music	 to permeate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	mind	was	flooded	with	images	and	thoughts.	The	eye	contact	she	made	drew her	in,	engaging	her	in	dialogue,	tapping	a	previously	untouched	depth	within	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	finally	arrived.	She	was	among	kindred	souls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lucille	looked	round	for	him,	he	had	to	be	here;	he’d	been	the	main	player	in	the dream,	going	by	the	name	of 	Rohan.	And	then,	as	if 	on	cue,	the	people	in	front	of her	parted	and	there	he	was,	on	the	other	side	of 	the	dance-floor,	standing	with	a group	of 	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	round	as	though	someone	had	called	his	name	–	and	she	realised	she just	 had.	 The	 smile	 that	 spread	 across	 his	 face	 when	 he	 saw	 her,	 made	 her	 soul yearn.	He	wasted	no	time	crossing	the	room	to	reach	her	and	embraced	her	like	a long	lost	lover. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 their	 lips	 touched	 her	 mind	 reeled	 in	 a	 white	 light	 that	 filled	 her	 entire being.	 When	 they	 broke	 apart	 she	 held	 his	 face,	 and	 looked	 deep	 into	 his	 eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moments	from	their	past	lives	flowed	like	an	exchange	of 	ideas	as	they	caught	up	to the	present.	They	had	found	each	other	again. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“It	was	him	again.	He	wants	me	to	meet	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scott	rubbed	her	back.	“Meet	him?	He	doesn’t	even	exist!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Felicity	shot	him	an	angry	glance. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“What	time	is	it?”	Felicity	whispered	as	they	moved	deeper	into	the	woods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scott	used	the	torch	to	look	at	his	watch.	“Two	minutes	to	twelve.	What’s	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	saw	a	strange	light	coming	through	the	foliage	and	headed	towards	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	they	arrived	in	the	clearing	the	angel	was	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	magnificent,	just	as	Felicity	had	dreamed.	His	chest	was	bare,	though	the angelic	 wings	 wrapped	 round	 him	 made	 him	 appear	 draped	 in	 soft	 finery.	 He seemed	 tall,	 the	 light	 green	 glow	 surrounding	 him	 accentuating	 it.	 His	 bright	 eyes pierced	hers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello	Felicity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 voice	 rumbled	 deep	 within	 her,	 awakening	 feelings	 and	 desires	 she’d	 never experienced	before.	A	longing	to	touch	him	overwhelmed	her.	She	stepped	closer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello	Zelus.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	eyed	Scott. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	is	your	companion?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	my	husband,	Scott.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Husband?”	Zelus’	brow	creased.	“Are	you	tied	to	another?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well	I	wouldn’t	say	tied	…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	been	married	for	several	years,”	Scott	interjected.	Zelus	ignored	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Felicity,	I	asked	you	to	meet	me,	to	join	me.	We	are	soulmates.	We	have	been	for centuries	 –	 it	 has	 taken	 me	 two	 of 	 them	 to	 find	 you.	 You	 can	 not	 stay	 with	 this mate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hold	on	a	minute—”	Scott	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>“Felicity	 please,	 you	 know	 it	 to	 be	 true.”	 Zelus’	 right	 wing	 opened	 and	 he proffered	a	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Felicity	felt	a	pull	in	her	gut.	She	knew	he	spoke	the	truth.	“But	Zelus,	I	can’t.	I’m not	like	you,	I’m	mortal,	human.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zelus	smiled	and	gave	a	small	laugh	that	sounded	like	distant	thunder.	“Felicity, you	are	spirit,	we	all	are.	You	simply	need	to	take	my	hand.	Come.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Felicity	hovered,	her	hand	coming	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Felicity!”	Scott	shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	glanced	back	at	Scott. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sorry	Scott,	but	I	…”	When	Felicity’s	hand	met	Zelus’	there	was	only	bright white	light	and	his	face.	She	was	home. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Matt	saw	it	in	her	face	their	first	night:	a	look	in	her	eyes.	He	didn’t	let	it	distract him	from	what	they	were	doing,	and	he	still	lost	himself 	in	the	moment	of 	sexual ecstasy	–	but	he’d	registered	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	she	left	in	the	morning,	showering	his	face	in	kisses	and	making	him	laugh, he	 sat	 and	 pondered	 what	 he’d	 seen.	 He	 didn’t	 want	 to	 do	 it	 again	 –	 break someone’s	heart,	it	broke	a	part	of 	him	too.	But	this	one?	Could	he	love	Jasmine? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	sighed.	He	wanted	to;	he	wanted	to	give	her	all	she	deserved.	But	could	he? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or	would	he	let	her	down	like	he	had	all	the	others? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later	that	day	he	had	to	smile	at	the	text	she	sent.	Jasmine	wasn’t	going	to	wait for	him,	she	was	going	to	run	the	show	and	he	liked	that.	And	when	she	turned	up at	his	door	again	the	next	day,	throwing	herself 	into	his	arms,	he	was	overjoyed	to embrace	her,	although	he	kept	her	in	check	with	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Days	grew	into	weeks,	which	gathered	into	months.	Matt	took	out	the	shoebox he	 kept	 under	 his	 bed	 and	 sifted	 through	 all	 the	 cards	 and	 scribblings	 she’d	 given him.	He’d	tried	to	find	the	courage	to	return	the	emotion,	but	all	he’d	been	able	to give	was	his	time;	taking	her	out	to	dinner,	shows,	the	cinema,	pubs,	bars,	anywhere to	 keep	 her	 entertained	 and	 distracted,	 because	 he	 knew	 she	 wanted	 more.	 She would	start	to	say	something	then	stop,	or	tell	him	she	wanted	to	know	him	better and	then	wait	for	him	to	speak.	But	he	wasn’t	good	at	speaking;	he	was	only	good at	 showing,	 so	 that’s	 what	 he	 did.	 He	 took	 her	 to	 bed	 and	 showed	 her	 time	 and again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 didn’t	 stop	 her	 pouring	 herself 	 into	 him	 by	 including	 him	 in	 everything	 she did.	And	he	was	happy	to	join	her	and	get	to	know	her	friends	and	their	boyfriends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 enjoyed	 the	 elaborate	 dinner	 parties	 she	 arranged	 and	 lost	 himself 	 in	 the drunken	conversation.	But	every	morning	when	they	woke	up	together	it	was	still there;	that	look	in	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	the	first	year	was	over	and	they	celebrated,	and	the	whole	evening	she	was watching	 him	 with	 expectation.	 He	 did	 all	 he	 could,	 spun	 her	 the	 best	 night	 they had	 had,	 and	 in	 the	 morning	 he	 thought	 he	 had	 pulled	 it	 off.	 But	 there	 she	 was looking	at	him,	only	this	time	with	a	little	box	in	her	hand.	He	was	terrified. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jasmine	had	always	been	forward,	moving	it	all	along	and	he	wondered	how	far she	was	taking	it	as	he	turned	the	box	over	in	his	hand.	It	was	a	perfect	tiny	square with	a	raised	top.	Matt’s	mind	reeled	at	the	idea	that	someone	else	might	pop	the question.	He	fiddled	with	it,	delaying,	but	she	pushed	his	fingers	against	it,	showing him	where	he	could	start	unwrapping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	fumbled	it	open	and	tipped	the	lid	a	crack,	trying	to	glimpse	what	was	within, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>before	revealing	it.	And	what	he	saw	made	him	frown.	He	paused,	opening	the	lid wider	and	picking	up	its	contents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	key?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	a	key.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	your	heart?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed.	“No,	to	my	apartment.	It’s	time,	don’t	you	think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What,	for	us	to	live	together?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 frowned	 at	 him	 and	 laughed	 again.	 “No	 silly,	 for	 you	 to	 be	 able	 to	 come round	whenever	you	want.	Why,	do	you	want	to	live	together?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well	…”	He	flustered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed	again.	“That’s	what	I	thought.	One	step	at	a	time,	eh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	…”	he	stammered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,	 I	 thought,	 you	 know,	 that	 as	 we’re	 in	 love,	 you	 know,	 that	 was	 the	 next step?	I	mean,	it’s	been	a	year.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 jaw	 dropped	 as	 she	 looked	 at	 him,	 and	 he	 felt	 his	 cheeks	 flush.	 Then	 she threw	herself 	on	him,	pushing	her	lips	against	his	with	such	a	fierceness	he	could only	 surrender	 –	 although	 surrender	 was	 all	 he	 wanted	 to	 do,	 so	 he	 returned	 the passion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	night	he	packed	a	bag,	and	when	they	reached	her	apartment	he	picked	her up	and	carried	her	over	the	threshold.	There	were	no	broken	hearts	here. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Paul	smashed	his	head	against	the	wall	and	screamed	as	hard	as	he	could.	He	felt	a dribble	 of 	 blood	 run	 to	 the	 tip	 of 	 his	 nose	 and	 wiped	 at	 it	 absently.	 It	 hadn’t helped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 grabbed	 his	 jacket	 and	 rushed	 out	 of 	 the	 apartment,	 shrugging	 it	 on	 as	 he fled	down	the	steps	to	the	street.	He	couldn’t	have	given	a	toss	that	it	was	two	in the	morning	and	the	city	was	flooded	with	drunks	exiting	nightclubs.	He	didn’t	see them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	didn’t	want	this,	not	tonight,	not	tomorrow,	not	any	day,	but	he	didn’t	have	a choice;	it	was	his	birth	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	urge	got	larger	he	picked	up	the	pace	and	started	running.	There	was	only one	place	for	his	kind	to	go	and	he	needed	to	get	there:	a	place	of 	sanctuary,	a	place of 	understanding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 even	 as	 the	 building	 came	 into	 sight	 he	 already	 knew	 it	 was	 too	 late.	 They were	in	the	 back	of 	his	mind	 already,	pushing	 forward,	consuming	every	 thought, every	impulse,	every	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stumbled,	trying	hard	to	focus	on	his	intent,	something	they	wanted	to	stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	slowed,	forcing	each	foot	in	front	of 	the	other,	resisting	what	they	wanted;	he wasn’t	going	to	turn	round;	he	wasn’t	going	to	the	bridge;	he	WAS	worth	more	than that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lights	were	on;	the	building	was	open	twenty-four	hours.	There	was	a	man on	the	door.	Paul	knew	that	–	but	that	meant	they	did	too.	The	whispering	escalated to	raised	voices	and	he	was	reduced	to	his	knees,	crawling	on	all	fours,	each	move	a personal	triumph	over	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	man	bleeding	from	his	head	and	crawling	along	a	street	in	the	early	hours	of the	morning.	Paul	knew	what	the	public	saw,	but	it	didn’t	mean	he	should	do	what the	voices	wanted.	It	didn’t	mean	that	he	was	worth	nothing	and	he	had	no	right	to be	here.	It	didn’t	mean	he	was	scum	or	worthless	and	didn’t	deserve	to	live! </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 shouted	 back,	 aware	 that	 it	 was	 out-loud	 rather	 than	 in	 his	 head,	 the humiliation	bringing	a	wave	of 	rage	that	pushed	them	out	for	a	moment,	allowing him	to	stand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	white	steps	up	to	the	facility	were	now	in	sight,	as	was	the	security	guard’s window.	Relief 	flooded	through	Paul	as	he	made	eye	contact	with	the	man.	But	it dulled	the	rage,	bringing	them	back	full	force	and	he	was	unable	to	climb	the	steps unaided. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 heard	 a	 bell	 ringing	 and	 several	 people	 in	 white	 coats	 came	 out	 to	 help	 the security	guard	bring	him	inside,	their	questions	barely	audible	over	the	noise	in	his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>head.	Once	in	the	entrance	hall	he	could	only	drop	to	his	knees	and	cover	his	ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	a	pair	of 	warm	hands	rested	on	his,	and	a	soft	voice	reached	him	as	though across	a	great	void. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Paul?	Paul?	Can	you	hear	me?	It’s	Audrey.	Paul,	look	at	me,	lift	your	head.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	brought	his	head	up	a	fraction.	A	light	flashed	in	his	eyes.	There	was	rustling around	him	and	her	voice	came	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	just	going	to	move	you	into	the	exam	room,	Paul.	Relief 	is	coming	soon,	I promise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	felt	himself 	being	lifted,	and	even	though	he	thought	it	impossible,	the	noise inside	reached	a	whole	new	level.	He	knew	Audrey	wasn’t	going	to	torture	him,	or probe	 him,	 or	 experiment	 on	 him.	 He	 knew	 she	 wouldn’t	 harm	 him.	 He	 wasn’t going	to	try	and	hurt	her	and	run	from	this	place,	this	was	where	he	needed	to	be and	he	repeated	that	over	and	over	to	try	and	placate	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	they	didn’t	stop,	not	until	the	needle	went	into	his	arm	and	the	drug	flooded into	his	bloodstream,	which	fortunately	only	took	a	few	seconds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 slumped	 back,	 exhausted,	 knowing	 that	 he’d	 made	 it;	 the	 attack	 was	 over	 –</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’d	won. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	it	was	just	a	single	battle	in	a	war	that	was	going	to	rage	for	the	rest	of 	his life,	each	one	was	a	fight	to	the	death,	and	maybe	next	time	he	wouldn’t	make	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>No	good	for	you</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">I	saw	it	as	he	swung	you	back	on	the	dance	floor.	Not	many	would	have,	but	I	was looking.	It	was	just	above	your	elbow,	and	it	brought	an	image	I	didn’t	enjoy	having in	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	swung	you	again	I	took	a	closer	look;	it	had	scabbed	over.	So	what	was	it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	couple	of 	days	old? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	wasn’t	there	earlier	in	the	week,	I	knew	that.	I’d	kissed	every	inch	of 	you	–	like I	always	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	smiled	at	the	guy	as	he	spun	you	round,	and	I	saw	it	then:	you,	him,	on	his lounge	carpet.	You	on	your	elbows	straddling	him.	Maybe	you	bent	to	kiss	him	and slipped,	or	was	it	the	movement?	Rabbits	came	to	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	threw	your	head	back	and	laughed	when	he	dipped	you,	but	when	you	saw me	your	smile	faltered.	I	picked	up	my	pint	and	took	a	sip,	not	taking	my	eyes	off you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	song	finished	and	you	came	straight	over	to	me.	Leaning	down	to	kiss	me,	I took	the	back	of 	your	head	and	made	it	a	deep	one,	giving	you	a	wink	as	we	broke off.	And	you	smiled	that	smile	that	was	just	for	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	glanced	over	to	see	the	guy	looking.	I	looked	back,	murder	in	my	eyes.	He	knew the	score. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	went	off 	again	this	time	to	chat	up	the	girls	and	I	relaxed,	letting	you	have your	time	and	enjoying	a	chat	with	the	lads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Time	shifted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	saw	you	dancing	with	him	again.	Okay,	correction,	he	was	dancing	with	you	and the	girls.	Still,	I	didn’t	like	it.	He	was	too	close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	saw	me	looking	and	just	looked	back.	I	wasn’t	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	glanced	over	at	the	lads	and	checked	they’d	seen	it.	They	had.	He	had	no	idea what	he	was	doing.	But	I	wasn’t	worried	about	him,	I	was	worried	about	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	glanced	over	too	and	I	winked	again.	You	smiled.	I	was	okay	with	that.	So	I moved	to	the	bar	and	got	us	some	drinks.	I	took	them	to	the	dance	floor	and	cut	in, stepping	 right	 in	 front	 of 	 him,	 giving	 you	 your	 drink	 and	 dancing	 with	 you	 for	 a couple	 of 	 seconds.	 I	 whispered	 in	 your	 ear	 and	 you	 flicked	 your	 tongue	 across mine.	I	kissed	your	neck	and	left	you	to	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	slow	songs	started	you	were	across	the	room	with	the	girls.	I	saw	you look	round	for	me	and	I	laughed	beckoning	you.	But	as	you	walked	to	me	he	was there	again,	pulling	at	you	to	go	with	him.	You	glanced	at	me	and	I	waited.	What were	you	going	to	do? </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 I	 saw	 it	 then:	 that	 look,	 that	 indecision.	 And	 I	 knew	 then	 as	 I’d	 always</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>known	that	scab	was	no	accident. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	moved	quickly	and	reached	you	in	a	couple	of 	strides,	my	hand	wrapping	round your	arm,	covering	the	scab. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	coming	home	with	me	mate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	puffed	his	chest	at	me	and	glanced	at	you.	You	gave	him	a	sympathetic	smile and	 nodded.	 He	 didn’t	 argue,	 walking	 to	 the	 door	 with	 the	 rest	 of 	 the	 departing club	goers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	lads	passed	me	they	patted	me	on	the	shoulder	reassuring	me	that	the	job would	be	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 led	 you	 out,	 my	 hands	 never	 leaving	 you.	 And	 in	 the	 back	 of 	 the	 taxi	 I	 took your	elbow,	turned	it	over	to	kiss	the	scab.	As	my	head	came	up,	our	eyes	met.	The sadness	 in	 mine	 palpable,	 letting	 you	 know	 I	 knew.	 Your	 eyes	 were	 wide	 but	 you turned	them	to	gaze	out	the	window	as	we	pulled	out	of 	the	parking	lot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	put	my	hand	on	your	leg	and	you	covered	mine	with	yours	as	a	tear	rolled	down your	cheek.	I	pulled	your	hand	over	to	my	leg	and	put	my	arm	round	you,	pulling you	into	me	and	kissing	the	top	of 	your	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	would	say	you	were	no	good	for	me,	but	it	was	me	that	was	no	good	for you;	I	let	you	do	whatever	you	want.	But	I	love	you,	so	what	can	I	do? </p>

<p class="calibre1">Annabelle	 giggled	 as	 she	 stood	 up	 and	 attempted	 to	 make	 her	 way	 through	 the crowd	 that	 seemed	 to	 have	 magically	 formed	 in	 the	 tiny	 club.	 How	 long	 had	 she been	here?	She	didn’t	know	anymore	…	and	didn’t	really	care.	She	pushed	through a	group	of 	guys	and	staggered	as	one	pushed	back.	Her	laugh	was	cut	short	by	the pain	 of 	 her	 bony	 hip	 hitting	 a	 pillar.	 She	 growled	 and	 shook	 a	 fist	 at	 the	 pillar, causing	the	guys	to	laugh.	She	laughed	with	them	and	continued	to	move	towards the	toilets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	fixed	her	eyes	on	the	door	and	made	a	beeline	for	it.	She	remembered	being twirled	 around	 at	 one	 point	 and	 was	 sure	 someone	 put	 a	 hand	 up	 her	 skirt,	 but before	she	knew	it	she	was	staring	into	the	dimly	lit	mirror	in	the	toilets,	trying	to focus	on	her	reflection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	ignored	the	bags	under	her	eyes,	and	how	her	cheeks	had	sunken	into	her	jaw line.	She	attempted	to	tidy	up	the	lipstick	that	had	smeared	during	the	last	line	of coke.	She	wasn’t	sure	if 	she	improved	it,	but	it	wasn’t	important;	what	was,	was	the rock	she’d	just	scored.	She	pulled	it	out	of 	the	tiny	pocket	in	her	tiny	skirt,	and	held it	up	between	thumb	and	forefinger.	She	licked	her	lips.	This	could	finally	do	it! </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 reached	 into	 her	 other	 pocket	 for	 her	 little	 foldable	 pipe	 and	 lighter.	 Then, taking	a	surreptitious	look	round	the	toilets	to	make	sure	no	one	had	seen	her,	she lurched	into	one	of 	the	cubicles	and	banged	the	door	shut,	fumbling	with	the	lock to	secure	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 pushed	 the	 little	 rock	 into	 the	 pipe	 bowl,	 imagining	 the	 rush	 before	 she’d even	brought	the	lighter	up	to	it,	and	fell	back	onto	the	toilet	seat	once	she	did. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When	 she	 woke,	 Annabelle	 cracked	 open	 an	 eye,	 but	 shut	 it	 again	 to	 protect	 it from	 the	 harsh	 white	 light	 glaring	 down	 from	 the	 ceiling.	 She	 tried	 to	 move	 her hand	 up	 to	 shield	 her	 eyes,	 but	 found	 it	 tied	 down.	 Another	 peep	 revealed	 wrist straps	tying	them	to	the	side	of 	a	metal	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Morning	Annabelle.	How	are	you	feeling?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	recognise	the	voice,	and	wasn’t	going	to	risk	opening	her	eyes	again	–</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	pain	of 	the	light	was	too	much.	She	tried	to	ask	her	own	question,	but	gagged instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Easy	honey,	don’t	try	to	speak,	we	need	to	take	your	intubation	tube	out	first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Come,	help	me	sit	you	up	and	breathe	out	hard	as	I	pull,	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	arm	came	round	her	back	and	Annabelle	felt	herself 	being	lifted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One,	two,	three,	and	blow	hard!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>Annabelle	 did,	 feeling	 something	 hard	 drag	 along	 her	 throat,	 reducing	 her	 to	 a coughing	fit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	okay	honey,	drink	this	and	it’ll	feel	better.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	time	Annabelle	opened	her	eyes	and	squinted	at	a	paper	cup	being	handed to	her.	She	took	a	sip	and	managed	to	croak,	“Where	am	I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	in	the	Mount	View	rehabilitation	hospital.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	did	I	get	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	were	brought	in	by	your	family	after	you	were	resuscitated	by	paramedics two	days	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Resuscitated?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep.	You	OD’ed	I	understand.	You	were	found	unconscious	in	a	toilet	in	a	club. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	while	they	weren’t	sure	you	would	make	it.	You’re	lucky	to	be	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annabelle	groaned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	hurting,	honey?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annabelle	nodded,	a	tear	running	down	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s	the	pain?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annabelle	tapped	her	chest	on	the	left,	and	mumbled,	“My	heart.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	nurse	checked	her	pulse.	“Is	it	a	sharp	pain?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	broken.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	The	nurse	was	looking	at	her	watch,	counting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	knew	I	didn’t	want	to	come	here,	but	they	brought	me	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	care	about	you,	honey.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	they	don’t.	They	only	care	about	their	‘good	name’.	Daddy’s	little	girl	can’t be	seen	to	be	on	drugs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">More	tears	tumbled	down	Annabelle’s	face.	She	looked	down	at	herself,	the	bag of 	bones	she	had	become	and	then	at	the	wrist	braces	holding	her.	If 	only	they	had left	her	just	a	little	bit	longer	it	would	be	over.	Now	she	had	to	start	all	over	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>House	of	Horror</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Eloise	didn’t	want	to	go	there	again,	but	they’d	insisted.	Her	hands	were	shaking	by the	time	they	pulled	up	at	the	bottom	of 	the	embankment.	When	she	looked	up	at the	 white	 weather-board	 house	 it	 seemed	 to	 plead	 its	 innocence,	 but	 she	 knew better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	 cars	 pulled	 up	 behind	 and	 then	 someone	 opened	 her	 door.	 Eloise	 spun round,	eyes	wide	with	terror	at	the	prospect	of 	getting	out	and	going	in	there	again, but	a	hand	took	her	arm	and	she	knew	she	had	to	comply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	climbed	the	embankment	with	them	surrounding	her.	There	was	no	escape, not	even	inside	her	head	where	the	sounds	she’d	endured	were	replayed,	even	those made	by	her	own	body.	She	stumbled	at	the	prospect	of 	facing	it	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 they	 approached	 the	 front	 door	 Eloise	 pulled	 at	 the	 man	 leading	 her,	 until they	 were	 standing	 over	 the	 coal	 shoot	 she’d	 been	 shoved	 down	 a	 few	 terrifying days	earlier.	The	men	opened	it,	taking	their	time,	ready	to	reveal	its	horrors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	smell	hit	her,	metallic	and	salty:	the	purist	form	of 	distilled	fear.	And	then the	sounds	reached	her	and	she	pulled	back,	pushing	against	the	men	that	held	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	clawed	at	their	hands	to	release	her	and	allow	her	to	run	free	from	the	torture chamber	below,	where	the	few	that	were	still	alive	wailed	their	agony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 they	 did,	 they	 let	 her	 go	 as	 they	 braced	 themselves	 for	 what	 was	 ahead, letting	 her	 run	 back	 to	 the	 police	 van.	 She	 pushed	 through	 the	 underbrush oblivious	to	the	damage	it	inflicted,	knowing	it	could	never	cut	as	deep	as	the	tools used	in	that	cellar.	Eloise	flew	into	the	arms	of 	a	waiting	social	worker,	where	she allowed	herself 	to	be	held	and	comforted,	and	reminded	that	her	ordeal	was	over. </p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">He	 could	 hear	 her,	 her	 breath	 panting,	 but	 it	 was	 distant.	 He	 followed	 where	 he thought	 it	 came	 from,	 but	 a	 crunch	 of 	 twigs	 turned	 him	 in	 another	 direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Damon	pushed	through	the	undergrowth,	ignoring	scratches	and	cuts	to	his	arms and	face,	and	the	yanking	at	his	long	overcoat	as	it	caught	on	branches.	He	had	to find	her,	had	to	get	hold	of 	her,	and	soon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 heard	 another	 crash	 and	 a	 squeal	 with	 it.	 It	 froze	 him	 in	 his	 tracks	 as	 he strained	 to	 hear	 more,	 but	 there	 was	 nothing.	 He	 slammed	 his	 shoulder	 against	 a tree	 trunk	 as	 he	 tripped	 over	 a	 root,	 pausing	 a	 second	 to	 catch	 his	 breath	 before going	on.	How	much	longer	could	he	keep	this	up? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	heard	a	shot	fired	somewhere	off 	to	his	left,	but	no	scream	followed	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	hoped	it	had	missed.	He	hoped	he	still	had	time	as	adrenaline	gave	him	another shove	forward.	He	was	determined.	He	had	to	be	the	first	to	reach	her;	he	couldn’t fail	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 wall	 of 	 thicket	 appeared	 in	 front	 of 	 him.	 As	 he	 approached	 it	 he	 wondered how	best	to	get	inside,	but	found	that	throwing	himself 	in	was	the	only	way.	Was she	in	here?	He	didn’t	know,	but	he	had	to	try. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he	 pushed	 further	 in,	 Damon	 was	 momentarily	 blinded	 by	 dense	 leaves.	 He felt	 his	 foot	 snag	 on	 something	 as	 he	 slid	 face	 first	 into	 a	 carpet	 of 	 leaves	 and mulch.	 But	 he	 barely	 felt	 it,	 his	 attention	 being	 caught	 by	 a	 sound	 next	 to	 him:	 a sharp	intake	of 	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Damon	turned	his	head	to	the	side	and	there	she	was,	cowering	away	from	him, hugging	her	naked	body	tight	in	an	attempt	to	cover	herself.	Her	leg	was	bleeding where	he’d	caught	it	with	his	shoe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pushed	back	onto	his	knees	and	turned	round,	opening	his	long	overcoat	and sweeping	it	round	her	as	best	he	could	in	the	tight	space.	She	pulled	it	round,	and let	him	embrace	her,	resting	her	trembling	body	against	his.	Whether	from	fear	or cold	Damon	couldn’t	tell,	but	at	least	he	had	her	first	before	the	monsters	came. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither	 of 	 them	 made	 a	 sound	 as	 they	 heard	 them	 crashing	 through	 the	 trees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Damon	 hoped	 the	 twigs	 and	 leaves	 of 	 the	 thicket	 had	 bounced	 back	 behind	 him and	they	wouldn’t	spot	where	he’d	dived	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Footsteps	crunched	nearer,	and	two	voices	spoke	in	rough	whispers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	came	through	here,	I’m	sure	of 	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 should	 have	 brought	 McKlennan,	 he	 could	 have	 tracked	 her	 better	 than you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	here	somewhere,	I	know	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	said	that	a	mile	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>“We’re	getting	close.	Shhh!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 men	 went	 still	 and	 Damon	 held	 his	 breath,	 feeling	 the	 girl	 do	 the	 same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	 waited.	 Then	 something	 crashed	 off 	 in	 the	 distance,	 an	 animal	 maybe, and	they	were	moving	again,	excited	by	the	sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	over	there!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	wait	to	have	her!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Damon	 and	 the	 girl	 didn’t	 move	 or	 speak,	 though	 they	 relaxed	 as	 the	 sound	 of the	men	became	distant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually	 the	 girl’s	 head	 came	 up	 from	 Damon’s	 chest,	 and	 she	 whispered, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 looked	 into	 her	 pale	 frightened	 eyes,	 and	 said,	 “Because	 you’re	 a	 valuable human	being,	not	a	piece	of 	meat	to	be	hunted.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">Jeffrey	 had	 seen	 his	 dad	 buy	 the	 fireworks	 and	 put	 them	 in	 the	 shed,	 but	 his	 dad wouldn’t	 let	 him	 touch	 them.	 He	 said	 they	 weren’t	 for	 children	 to	 play	 with,	 that they	had	to	be	handled	with	care.	Jeffrey	knew	all	about	handle	with	care:	it’s	what they’d	been	doing	with	him	his	whole	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	was	little	he	wondered	what	it	was	they	were	afraid	of;	what	it	was	he did	 that	 sparked	 so	 much	 fear	 in	 their	 eyes	 whenever	 he	 was	 around;	 why	 they barely	 touched	 him,	 or	 came	 near	 him.	 So	 he’d	 started	 experimenting	 and	 found that	there	were	quite	a	few	things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 first	 time	 the	 police	 had	 shown	 up	 he’d	 acted	 as	 sweet	 as	 pie,	 but	 by	 the fourth	he	didn’t	care	anymore.	The	empty	threats	were	just	that:	empty.	His	parents never	 followed	 through	 on	 any	 of 	 them,	 they	 were	 too	 afraid,	 afraid	 of 	 what	 he might	do	next	time.	Ironic	really. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	the	older	he	got	the	more	ways	he	discovered,	no	matter	what	they	tried	to hide	 from	 him,	 including	 the	 fireworks	 his	 dad	 had	 tried	 to	 sneak	 home.	 The fireworks	meant	for	his	baby	brother	Jeremy:	the	golden	boy,	the	one	who	got	all the	love	and	affection.	Did	they	really	think	Jeffrey	would	keep	his	hands	off ?	He was	fourteen	now.	His	dad	knew	better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Social	services	had	been	round	that	morning	talking	about	taking	him	away.	His mum	had	cried	a	lot.	First	time	he’d	ever	seen	her	do	that.	He	knew	he	was	hurting them,	and	he	tried	to	care,	but	he	didn’t	know	how.	Plus	he	knew	a	way	to	make	it all	better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	snuck	out	that	night.	Put	the	wheelbarrow	ready	in	the	middle	of 	the	garden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 he	 found	 his	 dad’s	 hiding	 place	 –	 it	 wasn’t	 hard.	 He	 placed	 the	 fireworks round	 the	 inside	 of 	 the	 wheelbarrow,	 in	 easy	 reach	 with	 him	 in	 the	 middle.	 He’d create	 one	 hell	 of 	 a	 bonfire.	 He	 added	 paraffin,	 liking	 the	 smell	 of 	 it	 on	 his clothing.	Then	he	counted	down	…	three,	two,	one. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In	every	scenario	she’d	run	in	her	head,	Amanda	had	seen	herself 	shaking,	barely able	to	hold	the	gun.	It	was	why	she’d	picked	the	little	Taurus	405	model,	easy	to hold	and	easy	to	conceal.	And	when	it	had	played	out	in	her	head	she	had	seen	him laughing	at	her.	But	he	wasn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stood	stock-still,	an	edge	of 	fear	in	his	eyes.	She	liked	that.	For	the	first	time ever	he	was	taking	her	seriously.	When	she	cocked	the	barrel	he	dropped	the	conch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	paused,	catching	her	breath,	debating	whether	to	go	through	with	it	or	not	–</p>
<p class="calibre1">never	imagining	she’d	get	this	far,	and	then	he	surprised	her	by	starting	to	beg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on	Mand,	you	don’t	want	to	be	doing	this.	You	don’t	want	to	go	shooting me.	You	don’t	want	that	on	your	conscience.	I’m	not	worth	jail	time.	Come	on,	this isn’t	you.	You’re	better	than	this.	This	isn’t	you	at	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	I’m	not	who	you	think	I	am,	Brandon.	I	know	I’m	not	who	I	thought	I was.	I	didn’t	think	I’d	be	somebody	who’d	let	a	man	beat	me	daily.	I	mean	look	at me?	Look	at	the	blood	trickling	down	the	side	of 	my	head.	That	might	be	you;	it might	 have	 been	 my	 mother,	 but	 it	 sure	 as	 shit	 isn’t	 me.	 And	 I	 let	 you	 do	 that Brandon.	Me,	no	one	else.	I	let	you	worm	your	way	in.	I	trusted	you,	I	believed	your sob	stories,	your	excuses,	your	sorry	speeches—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	meant	them	Mand,	I	really	meant	them,	it’s	just—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 spat	 in	 his	 face,	 “You	 didn’t	 mean	 a	 word	 of 	 them!	 Not	 one	 …	 single	 …</p>
<p class="calibre1">word!	If 	I	wasn’t	holding	this	gun	to	your	head,	you’d	still	be	beating	me	with	that!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amanda	 kicked	 the	 conch	 across	 the	 kitchen	 floor.	 “But	 I	 was	 ready	 for	 you	 this time	Brandon,	because	I	realised	that	you	were	never	gonna	stop.	And	I	need	you to	Brandon,	because	I	need	to	live.	I	need	to	show	those	two	little	people	upstairs, cowering	at	this	very	moment,	that	their	mother	is	worth	more	than	that,	that	she’s stronger	than	that,	that	she’s	better	than	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	I	can	change	Mand.	I	can	get	help.	I	can	turn	this	shit	around,	I	promise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Promise?”	 Amanda	 scoffed	 a	 half 	 laugh,	 the	 gun	 held	 firm.	 “You’re	 promises aren’t	worth	shit,	Brandon,	and	you	know	it.	You	won’t	do	any	of 	that.	Once	this gun	 is	 removed	 you’ll	 beat	 me	 to	 death,	 that’s	 what	 you’ll	 do.	 That’s	 the	 only promise	you’ll	keep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	felt	his	body	tense	under	the	barrel	of 	the	gun.	He	knew	she	was	right,	and she	knew	she	was	right	too.	And	in	that	moment	she	knew	what	she	had	to	do.	She pulled	 the	 trigger,	 feeling	 the	 warm	 spatter	 of 	 blood	 on	 her	 face,	 and	 his	 body slump	to	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>Prickly	Fingers</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	tips	of 	Fraser’s	fingers	tingled.	He	glanced	over	his	shoulder,	but	couldn’t	see anyone	else	in	the	library.	He	looked	back	at	his	hands.	They	were	never	wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	put	his	pen	down,	his	chain	of 	thought	broken,	and	stretched,	leaning	back	in his	chair,	listening.	His	ears	strained	for	the	minutest	of 	sounds:	a	turn	of 	a	page,	a breath,	 but	 there	 was	 nothing.	 His	 fingers	 hadn’t	 given	 up	 though;	 it	 felt	 like hundreds	of 	pins	were	attacking	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 sat	 forward	 and	 gathered	 his	 books	 together,	 sliding	 them	 carefully	 into	 his backpack,	making	as	little	noise	as	possible.	Then	he	heard	it:	a	tiny	scrape	across	a page. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fraser	 had	 narrowed	 down	 his	 stalker	 to	 one	 of 	 two	 girls	 on	 his	 course.	 He should	be	flattered	but	he	was	tired	of 	their	efforts	to	debunk	him.	They	thought	it was	funny.	They	liked	to	tease	him.	They’d	pretend	they	were	interested	in	him,	but they	weren’t,	it	was	his	fingers	they	were	fascinated	by. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 scanned	 the	 aisles	 as	 he	 left,	 catching	 a	 glimpse	 of 	 something	 light	 in	 the second	to	last	one.	It	was	the	blonde. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	outside,	Fraser	dashed	to	the	right,	hiding	behind	a	large	potted	plant	at	the entrance.	He	waited.	When	she	appeared	he	watched	her	pause,	looking	round	for him	before	heading	across	the	lawns	back	to	the	resident	halls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	followed	–	stalkee	turned	stalker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	could	see	her	head	flitting	from	side	to	side.	Did	she	sense	someone	watching her?	Did	her	body	give	her	signals	about	the	presence	of 	unseen	people	too?	How did	it	make	her	feel?	Uncomfortable?	He	moved	closer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stepped	into	the	shadow	of 	a	mature	oak	and	he	reached	out,	putting	a	hand on	 her	 shoulder.	 He	 felt	 her	 gasp	 as	 she	 stopped.	 He	 moved	 up	 against	 her,	 his hand	sliding	round	to	her	throat,	his	mouth	by	her	ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looking	for	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	she	breathed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thought	you	could	outsmart	me,	did	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 nervous	 titter	 escaped	 her	 lips	 as	 his	 prickling	 fingers	 massaged	 her	 throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry	 to	 disappoint	 but	 my	 fingers	 tell	 me	 everything.”	 His	 grip	 tightened	 on her	throat.	“Many	ask	what	it	feels	like.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	started	to	gag,	a	hand	coming	up	to	pull	his	away,	but	he	ignored	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	I	tell	them	it’s	a	bit	like	pins	and	needles.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	hand	batted	at	his. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	is	caused	by	the	circulation	being	cut	off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>The	batting	slowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	the	limbs	going	numb.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	hand	dropped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some	say	dead	even.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	body	went	limp.	He	lowered	it	to	the	ground,	laying	it	in	a	foetal	position	so passersby	 would	 think	 she	 was	 sleeping.	 He	 stood,	 adjusting	 the	 backpack	 on	 his shoulder	and	looked	at	her	lying	there	all	serene.	It	was	a	shame	they	couldn’t	take his	 word	 for	 it.	 He	 glanced	 around,	 but	 no	 one	 had	 seen	 him.	 He’d	 know,	 his fingers	would	tell	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>Scissors	vs.	Knife</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">She	told	him	to	leave	her	alone	when	she	was	untangling	the	lights,	but	he	wouldn’t listen.	She’d	put	them	up	on	the	tree	enough	times	to	know	how	it	was	done,	but	he liked	 to	 think	 he	 knew	 better.	 She	 bit	 her	 tongue	 and	 went	 with	 it,	 because	 she wanted	 to	 get	 the	 decorations	 up	 and	 relax,	 but	 all	 the	 way	 through	 he	 kept irritating	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	watched	him	hang	the	paperchains	up	at	the	window.	At	least	he	was	good	at that;	he	had	the	height	for	it.	But	when	he	stood	back	to	admire	them,	she	could feel	her	rage	building	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 at	 the	 dining	 table	 he	 started	 wrapping	 up	 the	 presents.	 He	 used	 a	 knife, claiming	it	was	easier	than	scissors.	But	she	knew	he	just	liked	being	a	smartass	and wanted	to	look	cool	wrapping	his	presents	all	nice	and	tight,	while	hers	were	baggy and	unprofessional. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	he	did	it;	he	finally	pushed	that	one	last	button,	commenting	how	he	could do	it	all	himself,	he	didn’t	really	need	her.	Well,	those	might	not	have	been	his	exact words,	but	it	was	what	he	meant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sophie	grabbed	the	scissors	and	stabbed	them	through	his	hand.	She	didn’t	give him	 long	 to	 recover	 from	 the	 shock	 before	 pulling	 them	 out	 and	 stabbing	 him again,	 this	 time	 in	 the	 chest.	 She	 was	 surprised	 how	 easily	 they	 went	 in,	 although they	were	harder	to	get	out.	When	she	yanked	them,	they	flew	out	of 	her	bloodied hands	 into	 the	 Christmas	 tree.	 She	 glanced	 over	 her	 shoulder	 to	 see	 where	 they'd gone,	ignoring	his	gurgling	sounds.	She	decided	if 	they	weren’t	clearly	visible	she’d leave	them	there	–	she	didn’t	want	to	ruin	the	tree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	she	turned	back	to	him,	his	tongue	was	protruding	and	his	eyes	were	wide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 gone.	 She	 sighed.	 Then	 she	 got	 up	 and	 went	 to	 the	 sideboard,	 pouring herself 	a	large	port.	Now	she	could	relax. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>Last	Supper</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	 called	 her	 earlier	 in	 the	 day	 to	 confirm	 the	 time	 he	 was	 coming	 home.	 She couldn’t	 wait;	 the	 house	 was	 immaculate,	 and	 the	 dining	 room	 all	 laid	 out.	 She’d even	polished	the	silver	candelabra. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	dusk	approached	she	prepared	the	food.	He	liked	it	meaty	and	lots	of 	it,	so she	had	gone	beyond	her	usual	expertise,	and	set	it	out	in	their	best	dishes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 she	 got	 herself 	 ready,	 slipping	 into	 a	 comfortable	 sexy	 black	 dress.	 She knew	 he’d	 like	 it.	 She	 smiled.	 It	 was	 perfect;	 he	 wouldn’t	 know	 what	 hit	 him.	 She giggled.	No,	he	wouldn’t,	but	that	was	how	she	wanted	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	heard	his	car	and	glided	down	the	ornate	staircase,	hovering	on	the	bottom step	as	she	heard	his	footsteps	on	the	gravel	drive.	He	opened	the	door	and	paused when	he	saw	her.	His	greeting	caught	in	his	throat	as	his	eyes	swept	over	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Avril,	you	look	…	amazing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	Paul.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 shut	 the	 door	 behind	 him	 and	 put	 his	 briefcase	 down.	 She	 could	 see	 a question	forming	in	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	want	to	ask	me	why,	don’t	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stammered	as	he	replied,	“Well	yes,	I	do.	I	…	Is	there	a	reason?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Avril	smiled	at	him.	“We’ll	get	to	that	later,	first	I	want	you	to	enjoy	it	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 saw	 a	 crease	 flutter	 across	 his	 temple,	 but	 he	 remained	 silent	 while	 she	 led him	to	the	dining	room.	When	he	saw	the	presentation	of 	their	meal,	he	stood	in the	doorway	blinking,	letting	out	a	slight	laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	closer,	take	a	look	at	what	I’ve	prepared.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	 prepared?	 You	 mean	 this	 wasn’t	 catered?”	 Paul	 stumbled	 forward, peeking	under	the	lids	of 	the	huge	tureens.	It	looked	divine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 sat	 down	 at	 the	 head	 of 	 the	 table,	 and	 Avril	 sat	 at	 his	 side.	 She	 wanted	 to	 be close	to	him	and	share	the	intimacy	of 	the	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 watched	 her	 serve	 him,	 laughing	 as	 she	 piled	 all	 the	 food	 onto	 his	 plate, relaxing	a	little	as	she	piled	it	on	her	own	too.	He	watched	her	tuck	in	first	before starting	in	on	his	own,	and	they	sat	gorging	themselves	on	all	the	meaty	delights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	she	brought	over	a	bottle	of 	red	wine	she’d	opened	earlier,	and	poured	a healthy	 quantity	 into	 both	 of 	 their	 wine	 glasses.	 He	 laughed	 as	 he	 raised	 his	 and took	several	swallows	from	it.	Then	his	demure	changed,	the	smile	sliding	from	his lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	something	in	this,	isn’t	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded	while	she	sipped	at	hers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	you’ve	got	the	same,	haven’t	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>She	nodded	again	and	gave	a	small	smile	as	she	said,	“I’m	not	about	to	let	you	go out	alone.	We	started	out	together	and	we’ll	end	together.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 eyes	 flashed	 with	 fear	 and	 rage	 as	 he	 regarded	 the	 glass	 and	 threw	 the contents	across	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	knew	this	was	too	good	to	be	true!	You	haven’t	done	anything	like	this	for	me in	years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	haven’t	wanted	me	to;	you’ve	had	‘her’	to	do	it	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	rage	dropped,	but	the	fear	remained.	He	swallowed.	“You	mean,	Larissa?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes	dear,	Larissa.	Did	you	think	I	wouldn’t	find	out?	Did	you	think	I	would	be okay	with	it	continuing	under	my	nose?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	have	you	done?”	he	whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Avril	 waved	 her	 arm	 across	 the	 table	 in	 front	 of 	 them.	 “I	 decided	 to	 celebrate with	a	meal;	a	last	supper	if 	you	will,	while	the	poison	does	its	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paul	could	feel	his	legs	tingling.	“But	I	haven’t	drunk	enough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 wasn’t	 just	 in	 the	 wine,	 dear.”	 Sweat	 beads	 were	 breaking	 out	 on	 Avril’s forehead	and	she	dabbed	them	with	a	napkin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	meat?”	Paul’s	mouth	felt	strange,	the	edges	had	started	twitching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	marinated	her	well.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Paul	managed	to	whisper,	“Her?”	as	he	started	to	slide	down	the	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Avril	was	also	struggling.	Her	glass	dropped	from	her	hand	as	her	arm	went	limp, but	she	managed	a	giggle,	and	said,	“Yes,	Larissa.	She	had	more	meat	on	her	than	I thought.	She	tasted	pretty	good,	don’t	you	think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 frozen	 look	 of 	 horror	 completed	 it	 for	 Avril	 as	 she	 grinned	 her	 way	 into death. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>Limits</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Cheryl	 could	 see	 the	 woman’s	 mouth	 moving,	 jaw	 going	 up	 and	 down,	 but	 she couldn’t	make	out	all	the	words,	not	from	across	the	aisle.	The	woman	was	going	at him	 nineteen	 to	 the	 dozen,	 keeping	 her	 volume	 low,	 but	 the	 high	 pitch	 whine sounded	 upset	 to	 Cheryl.	 The	 woman	 seemed	 to	 be	 pleading	 with	 him,	 her	 eyes searching	his	face	for	some	kind	of 	attention	or	recognition.	He	just	stared	out	the window,	rocking	gently	with	the	motion	of 	the	train,	oblivious	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 a	 moment	 Cheryl	 wondered	 if 	 they	 were	 together;	 maybe	 the	 woman	 was talking	into	a	hidden	mobile	phone	mic	–	or	even	talking	to	herself.	But	then	the woman	sat	forward	and	flicked	her	hand	against	his	leg	in	annoyance,	making	him jump. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	drew	back	from	her	touch	as	though	it	was	something	vile	and	stared	at	her, his	eyes	hard	and	unforgiving.	The	woman	sat	back	again,	silenced	by	the	look,	her cheeks	flushing.	Cheryl	could	see	she	was	trying	to	stay	composed,	but	a	stray	tear betrayed	her	attempts.	He	resumed	his	overview	of 	the	passing	countryside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cheryl	was	about	to	do	the	same	when	a	quick	movement	caught	her	peripheral vision,	 followed	 by	 an	 ascending	 scream.	 He	 looked	 as	 shocked	 as	 Cheryl,	 the expression	remaining	on	his	face	as	the	light	faded	from	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	 in	 the	 carriage	 stopped	 what	 they	 were	 doing	 and	 turned	 in	 the direction	 of 	 the	 scream.	 Hands	 went	 to	 mouths,	 and	 the	 inhaling	 of 	 breath	 was audible	as	they	sat	aghast	at	the	spectacle,	too	horrified	to	move	or	speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 her	 scream	 spent	 the	 woman	 sat	 back	 down.	 This	 time	 it	 was	 her	 turn	 to stare	out	of 	the	window,	while	his	frozen	gaze	stared	down	at	the	umbrella	handle sticking	out	of 	his	chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>In	the	Dark,	They	Sing</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Crowley’s	 heart	 lifted	 upon	 sight	 of 	 the	 derelict	 building	 the	 sanctuary	 resided beneath.	It	stood	black	against	the	night	sky.	He	felt	the	stress	of 	a	week	away	begin to	loosen	as	he	pulled	the	car	under	the	side	porch	and	covered	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 heard	 him	 enter,	 their	 cries	 bringing	 a	 smile	 to	 his	 lips,	 washing	 away	 the remnants	of 	his	arduous	week.	He’d	missed	them	–	and	them	him.	A	week	alone felt	 like	 an	 eternity,	 he	 knew	 that.	 He	 went	 about	 his	 ministrations,	 giving	 them much	needed	sustenance;	their	outstretched	hands	grabbing	what	they	could,	a	few lucky	ones	grabbing	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	they	settled,	he	did	too,	taking	his	place	in	the	worn	armchair	in	the	centre	of the	cavernous	room	facing	the	cell	doors.	Eyes	peered	between	bars	set	into	thick oak.	The	doors	afforded	him	protection	until	he	opened	them.	But	it	was	early	yet and	he	had	to	recover	from	a	week	out	in	the	real	world	first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	unscrewed	the	bourbon,	enjoying	its	glint	in	the	lantern	light.	He	relished	the first	sip,	the	fire	awakening	his	soul	as	it	warmed	his	body.	It	wouldn’t	take	many	to bring	him	back	to	life	tonight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	watched	him	as	he	drank,	waiting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 just	 two	 he	 stood	 up,	 hearing	 their	 collective	 breaths	 as	 he	 walked	 to	 the back	of 	the	room	to	the	CD	player.	He	needed	something	dark	and	heavy	tonight, something	that	would	talk	to	his	soul.	He	knew	the	one	he	needed,	and	they	knew	it too	once	he	put	it	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 heard	 their	 murmurs	 when	 the	 first	 chords	 came	 through	 the	 tiny	 speakers, and	he	felt	their	eyes	on	him	as	he	walked	to	the	corner	to	fetch	the	keys,	the	rattle of 	which	heightened	their	voices,	bringing	out	their	melodic	high	pitched	tones.	His mood	lifted	further;	this	was	always	his	favourite	part. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 shrank	 back	 as	 he	 turned	 the	 key	 in	 each	 lock,	 but	 he	 let	 them	 do	 the opening	tonight;	he	was	in	no	hurry.	Instead	he	returned	to	his	chair	and	the	amber liquid	that	enhanced	his	enjoyment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 door	 in	 the	 middle	 creaked	 open.	 Crowley	 knew	 she’d	 be	 first;	 she	 was bolder	than	the	others,	more	daring.	She	slithered	out,	pressing	herself 	against	the wall	and	sliding	down	it,	relieved	to	be	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	nakedness	aroused	him,	but	he	remained	seated,	knowing	she	would	come	to him	in	her	own	time,	but	only	once	the	others	came	out	too.	They	were	a	collective</p>
<p class="calibre1">–	it	was	why	he	enjoyed	them	so	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 they	 appeared	 they	 drew	 together	 like	 magnets,	 huddling	 close,	 their	 unique forms	 fitting	 like	 a	 writhing	 puzzle.	 He	 watched	 their	 constant	 motion	 as	 they stroked	and	caressed	each	other,	comforting	and	titillating	at	the	same	time.	Once</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>fully	awake	and	excited	they	turned	their	gaze	on	him	with	a	sparkle	in	their	eyes.	It was	his	turn	to	inhale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crowley	set	his	drink	down,	and	loosened	his	trousers,	bracing	himself 	for	their onslaught.	 Capturing	 dark	 forest	 fairies	 was	 one	 thing,	 but	 satiating	 their	 lurid desires	was	another.	He’d	learnt	to	hold	his	own	under	their	frenzied	devouring	of all	he	had	to	offer,	and	although	he	might	be	left	raw,	he	was	never	left	wanting.	He didn’t	 know	 if 	 he	 could	 ever	 let	 them	 go,	 and	 in	 the	 peaks	 of 	 their	 coupling,	 he hoped	they	didn’t	want	him	to. </p>

As	I	can’t	listen	to	music when	I	write,	it	was	a	game	changer	for	me	and	produced	some	incredible	stories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thanks	Jeff! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Susi	Holliday,	for	her	pep	talks	and	constant	belief 	that	I	am	a	worthy	writer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Angela	 Lynn,	 whose	 conviction	 in	 my	 writing	 ability	 has	 never	 wavered	 –	 and who	has	also	allowed	me	the	privilege	of 	being	her	editor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imran	 Siddiq	 and	 Michael	 Wombat	 for	 letting	 me	 pick	 their	 brains	 about	 self publishing	 –	 especially	 Wombat	 who	 happily	 answered	 all	 my	 tricky,	 fiddly, formatting	questions,	with	the	natural	breeze	of 	a	pro	–	which	of 	course	he	is! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Michael	Sands	who	allows	me	to	talk	his	ear	off 	on	many	occasions	over	Skype. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sara	 Mickleburgh	 for	 her	 patience	 while	 waiting	 for	 me	 to	 finally hand	over	the	book	for	proofing,	after	asking	her	a	good	year	earlier, and	for	the	excellent	job	she	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh	and	my	husband,	who	allows	me	to	sit	at	home	and	conjure	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	these	tales	around	taking	care	of 	our	two	children,	while	he	goes out	to	work.	Thanks	Ron. </p>

<p class="calibre1">If 	you	enjoyed	this	book	–	which	I	sincerely	hope	you	did	–	please	leave	a	review on	whatever	platform	you	bought	it	on,	or	Goodreads	if 	you	have	an	account	there. </p>
