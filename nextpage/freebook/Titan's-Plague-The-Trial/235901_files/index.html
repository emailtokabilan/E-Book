<p class="calibre1">Pati	 McLear	 felt	 the	 sting	 of	 her	 husband’s	 slap	 across	 her	 face.	 She	 did	 not collapse	from	the	blow,	or	even	look	away	from	his	stare.	She	wiped	her	cheek</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	her	left	hand.	“You	should	know	better	than	to	hit	me,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard	McLear	stood	back	a	step	and	exhaled.	He	put	his	hand	on	his	hips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know.	But	you	shouldn’t	have	provoked	me,”	he	said.	Richard	was	just	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">two	meters	tall,	had	a	mass	of	ninety	kilos,	was	thirty-five	years	old,	and	other than	his	brown	hair	balding,	seemed	a	young	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	stood	a	head	shorter	than	Richard	and	weighed	half	as	much.	With	black</p>
<p class="calibre1">hair,	and	tearing	blue	eyes,	she	looked	her	twenty-four	years.	Her	preference	for wool	 clothes,	 along	 with	 her	 height,	 marked	 her	 as	 an	 Earth	 immigrant.	 “You can’t	 stop	 me	 from	 talking	 about	 the	 problem,”	 she	 said.	 “We’ve	 been	 through this	a	hundred	times	and	I’m	not	getting	anywhere	with	you.	You	promised	six</p>
<p class="calibre1">months	 ago	 that	 we’d	 be	 leaving	 to	 visit	 Earth,	 today,	 and	 not	 only	 are	 we	 not going,	you’ve	done	nothing	to	prepare	so	we	can	leave	six	months	from	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	 been	 busy	 at	 work.	 With	 the	 new	 line	 of	 freighters,	 I	 have	 to	 attend every	 launch	 ceremony.	 My	 brother	 can’t	 do	 it	 all	 from	 up	 there,”	 he	 said, pointing	to	a	ceiling	five	meters	above	the	floor.	They	stood	in	the	great	room	of their	 mansion	 in	 the	 city	 of	 Karakorum,	 on	 Titan,	 the	 primary	 moon	 of	 Saturn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 great	 room	 was	 larger	 than	 ten	 meters	 square,	 floored	 with	 real	 hardwood and	 surrounded	 by	 beige	 walls.	 The	 furniture,	 which	 could	 seat	 a	 double-digit audience,	was	a	brownish-red,	synthetic	fabric.	A	style	popular	on	Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 your	 brother’s	 been	 to	 Earth	 in	 the	 last	 six	 months,	 missing	 no	 work that	I	can	see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	do	you	think	was	left	in	charge	while	he	traveled?	This	business	is	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	reason	people	exist	on	Titan.	If	anything	happens	to	McLear	Industries,	we can	book	trips	back	to	the	inner	system	and	live	off	relief	funds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	can’t	it	be	his	turn	to	stay	here	and	we	go	back	to	Earth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	working	on	it,	but	there	are	too	many	commitments	for	the	both	of	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	talk	with	him	about	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	face	tightened	and	he	gritted	his	teeth.	“You	leave	that	to	me.	I’ll	decide when	we	go	back,	and	we’ll	go	as	soon	as	I	think	it’s	possible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	stepped	back	into	his	space.	“You’re	scared	of	the	gravity	treatments,	is that	it?	You	can’t	take	the	pain	anymore.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	face	turned	red.	Because	he	was	born	and	raised	on	Titan,	and	its	human-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p5"></a>positioned	satellite	of	Picus,	his	complexion	remained	light	and	European-based. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	red	increased	with	his	breathing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	just	going	to	stand	there?	Answer	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 shook	 his	 head.	 “You	 stupid	 little	 bitch.	 How	 dare	 you	 talk	 to	 me	 that way.	You	would	still	be	back	in	that	peasant	village	if	it	wasn’t	for	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great,	 you’re	 back	 to	 that	 superiority	 of	 wealth	 you	 like	 to	 throw	 in	 my face.	 You	 know,	 you	 never	 used	 to	 do	 that,	 Richard.	 You	 used	 to	 treat	 me equally,	even	when	you	were	pissed	off.	In	the	last	year,	it	seems	you	never	want to	even	associate	with	me	unless	it’s	an	occasion	where	you	need	a	wife.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	you	haven’t	shown	yourself	to	be	good	for	anything	else.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	just	when	have	you	given	me	the	chance	to	do	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shook	his	head.	“I	don’t	know	how	many	times	we	let	you	work	with—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Work	with	you!	You	drag	me	up	to	Picus,	have	me	sit	at	a	desk	all	day	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing	 to	 do,	 and	 then	 take	 me	 back	 here.	 Just	 because	 you	 pay	 me	 doesn’t make	it	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	not	good	for	anything	else!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	felt	her	blood	boil.	She	tried	so	often	to	help	out,	but	it	didn’t	help	that she	hadn’t	received	an	advanced	education	in	business,	physics,	or	engineering, areas	Richard	and	his	brother	excelled	in	due	to	their	upbringing.	A	situation	Pati didn’t	have	available	to	her,	or	at	least	hadn’t	known	would	be	important	if	she married	a	McLear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	you	say	something,”	Richard	said.	“Tell	me	where	I	can	employ	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	no,	you’re	not	working	in	the	shipyard	or	factory.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 wouldn’t	 leave	 his	 space.	 She	 purposely	 stayed	 within	 arm’s	 reach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Insulting	me	won’t	get	me	to	back	down,”	she	said.	“You	brought	me	to	Titan, </p>
<p class="calibre1">you	asked	me	to	marry	you,	and	you	followed	through	with	it	when	I	said	yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 backed	 away	 a	 little,	 still	 staying	 within	 his	 reach.	 “I	 can	 be	 productive;	 I just	need	your	help	to	go	in	the	right	direction.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	facial	expression	hadn’t	changed.	“All	you’re	good	for	is	siring	the	next</p>
<p class="calibre1">McLear	heir.”	He	then	smiled	in	an	evil	way.	“And,	I’m	not	sure	you’ll	be	good for	that	either.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	felt	her	own	face	tighten,	and	heat	rush	into	it.	“I	doubt	you’d	be	able	to manage	the	task,	anyway,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 a	 quick	 movement,	 he	 reached	 across	 with	 his	 right	 hand	 and	 threw	 a backhand	across	her	face.	She	felt	the	knuckles	contact	her	right	eye	socket	and even	saw	stars	as	he	struck	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	didn’t	think.	She	clenched	her	right	fist	and	hit	him	with	an	uppercut	to the	chin.	Pati	watched	him	lift	up,	and	then	fall	back	to	the	ground.	She	regretted the	punch	immediately,	even	more	so	as	his	head	struck	one	of	the	steel	supports. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p6"></a>The	resulting	clang	told	her	the	situation	was	not	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	no!”	Pati	said.	She	rushed	to	his	side,	where	his	body	lay	crumpled	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	hardwood	floor.	He	was	unconscious,	with	blood	flowing	through	his	brown</p>
<p class="calibre1">hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Medical	bot,	now!”	she	screamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 tracked	 metallic	 robot	 moved	 in	 from	 the	 kitchen.	 Shorter	 than	 Pati,	 it could	reach	up	to	Richard’s	height	if	needed	for	treatment.	Since	he	lay	on	the floor,	 it	 lowered	 itself	 slightly.	 It	 held	 a	 scanning	 monitor	 over	 his	 head,	 then moved	it	down	the	rest	of	his	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Massive	head	trauma,”	the	machine	voice	said.	“Calling	emergency	medical</p>
<p class="calibre1">services,	which	should	arrive	in	the	next	three	minutes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will	he	be	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	machine	waited.	“Indeterminable,	at	this	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	to	do	something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will	 comply,”	 it	 said.	 It	 reached	 down	 with	 another	 of	 its	 two	 limbs	 and touched	Richard’s	head	where	the	blood	was.	Pati	couldn’t	see	exactly	what	was happening	due	to	the	blood,	and	after	a	few	seconds,	the	robot	retracted	the	limb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bleeding	is	stopped,”	it	reported. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	has	his	heartbeat,”	it	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	what—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will	 attempt	 to	 restart	 heart,”	 it	 said.	 The	 limb	 that	 fixed	 the	 bleeding changed	 the	 apparatus	 it	 held	 and	 placed	 the	 new	 device	 over	 Richard’s	 chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard	shook.	“Shock	delivered.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	his	heart	beating?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	will	deliver	second	shock.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	saw	Richard	shake	again.	She	didn’t	ask	the	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will	deliver	third	shock,”	the	robot	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	couldn’t	ask	any	more	questions.	She	waited	to	see	what	the	robot	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Emergency	services	are	arriving,”	the	robot	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 took	 the	 cue	 to	 let	 them	 in	 the	 door.	 She	 hurried,	 hoping	 real	 people could	help	Richard	where	this	robot	had	failed.	She	also,	not	for	the	first	time, asked	herself.	“Why	did	I	ever	leave	Earth?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>Pati	 sat	 on	 the	 couch	 in	 the	 McLear	 House	 great	 room.	 She	 waited	 while	 the emergency	services	rolled	Richard’s	body	out	the	door.	They	had	to	bag	his	body in	front	of	her	and	couldn’t	wait	for	the	hospital	to	do	it.	Why	couldn’t	they	have just	put	him	on	the	stretcher	and	covered	his	face	respectfully? </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 stood	 to	 follow	 them	 out.	 When	 she	 got	 to	 the	 door,	 a	 man	 and	 a	 lady were	waiting	to	enter.	They	both	looked	at	Pati	and	waited	for	Richard’s	body	to go	by	them.	The	male	stepped	in	front	of	Pati. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ms.	 McLear,	 I’m	 Detective	 Germain	 Bennett	 and	 this	 is	 Detective	 Esra Haldi.	 We’d	 like	 to	 speak	 with	 you.”	 The	 man	 was	 of	 African	 descent,	 at	 least that’s	what	Pati	thought,	and	the	lady	of	maybe	Semitic	origins.	They	both	were taller	 than	 her,	 a	 situation	 she	 came	 to	 expect	 on	 Titan,	 and	 neither	 looked overweight	in	their	brown,	but	not	uniform	suits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	husband.	I	need	to	go	with	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	nothing	you	can	do	for	him	now,	Ms.	McLear,	and	we	need	to	find</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	what	happened	as	soon	as	possible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 wasn’t	 in	 a	 fighting	 mood.	 She	 stepped	 back	 and	 let	 them	 enter.	 They stopped	in	the	center	of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	 I	 see	 where	 your	 husband	 was	 when	 you	 struck	 him?”	 Detective</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bennett	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 hadn’t	 expected	 the	 question.	 She	 had	 to	 think	 for	 a	 moment	 and realized	 what	 she’d	 told	 the	 emergency	 technicians	 must	 have	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">communicated	 to	 this	 detective.	 “He	 was	 standing	 right	 there,”	 she	 said.	 She pointed	to	a	spot	equidistant	from	the	front	door	to	the	rear	of	the	room.	Where Richard	stood	was	slightly	more	than	two	meters	from	the	pillar	he’d	struck.	So, he	didn’t	fly	as	far	as	she	remembered,	he	just	fell	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	detective	stood	in	the	same	spot.	“Right	here?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	that’s	where	my	husband	was	standing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 removed	 a	 handheld	 communicator	 from	 his	 coat	 pocket,	 a	 model	 Pati had	 never	 seen	 before.	 He	 ran	 a	 red	 laser	 along	 the	 floor	 and	 to	 the	 pillar.	 The pillar	still	had	a	bloodstain	where	Richard	had	hit	it,	and	the	detective	focused	on that	point	for	a	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	do	anything	to	Mr.	McLear	after	he	hit	this	pillar?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	called	for	the	medical	robot.	I	never	touched	him	after	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 detective	 nodded	 and	 studied	 his	 handheld.	 The	 other	 detective	 moved closer	to	Pati,	and	stood	within	arm’s	distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	I	need	legal	assistance?”	Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	 at	 this	 time,”	 Detective	 Bennett	 said.	 “However,	 we	 appreciate	 you giving	 us	 permission	 to	 evaluate	 the	 scene.	 Everything	 you	 told	 the	 medical technicians	 about	 the	 conflict	 was	 documented,	 although	 that	 is	 not	 considered</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>evidence	 at	 this	 time.	 As	 long	 as	 the	 physical	 evidence	 matches	 up	 with	 your story,	we	will	not	be	questioning	you	here	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 stepped	 toward	 Detective	 Bennett,	 and	 Detective	 Haldi	 followed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">staying	within	arm's	reach.	“I	thought	you	said	you	just	needed	to	talk	with	me,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	yes,	in	a	manner	of	speaking,	that	is	what	we	meant.	However,	in	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">situation,	it’s	important	for	us	to	have	access	to	the	crime	scene,	and	we	needed you	to	allow	that.”	He	shook	his	head	and	walked	past	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">What	did	he	mean	by	crime	scene? </i>	Pati	thought.	What	happened	to	Richard was	an	accident.	Would	she	be	better	off	asking	them	to	leave?	Because	she	got the	feeling	their	interests	did	not	necessarily	agree	with	hers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Detective	Bennett	manipulated	his	handheld,	staring	down	at	the	device.	Pati</p>
<p class="calibre1">waited	for	at	least	five	minutes	before	he	returned	his	attention	to	her.	“This	is where	you	live?	Correct?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	we’re	not	traveling	or	staying	on	Picus.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 nodded	 and	 returned	 his	 attention	 to	 the	 handheld	 communicator.	 Pati waited,	and	then	walked	over	to	a	couch	and	sat.	Detective	Haldi	moved	as	well, except	this	time,	she	took	a	place	between	Pati	and	the	front	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 another	 few	 minutes	 when	 he	 looked	 up.	 “Detective	 Haldi,	 please remove	the	sample	on	the	post.”	He	glanced	at	Pati,	“With	your	permission.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	exhaled	in	frustration.	“Sure,	go	ahead.	What	else	do	you	want?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	almost	finished,	Ms.	McLear,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Detective	Haldi	pulled	a	wipe	from	a	packet	she	carried	around	her	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 stepped	 to	 the	 pillar	 where	 Richard	 had	 struck	 his	 head,	 and	 removed	 the bloodstain	 left	 on	 it,	 leaving	 a	 brighter	 surface.	 She	 returned	 to	 her	 position between	Pati	and	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Detectives,	 I’m	 really	 tired	 right	 now,	 you	 can	 imagine	 my	 day	 has	 been difficult,	and	there’s	no	end	of	people	I	need	to	talk	to	at	this	moment.	So,	if	you don’t	mind,	please	finish	what	you	came	to	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Detective	Bennett	looked	up	from	his	handheld,	and	then	at	Detective	Haldi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	nodded,	and	stepped	toward	Pati.	“Okay,	maybe	it’s	time	we	get	to	it.	Ms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">McLear,	we’ll	need	you	to	come	with	us,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait,	you	said	before—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	 trying	 to	 do	 our	 job	 here	 and	 you	 want	 to	 interfere.	 Since	 it	 seems you	 wish	 to	 deny	 our	 entry,	 then	 we’ll	 need	 to	 take	 you	 into	 custody	 and	 wait until	the	proper	paperwork	is	filed	so	we	can	come	back	and	finish	our	job.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	never—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 didn’t	 want	 to	 do	 it	 this	 way,	 but	 you’ve	 forced	 our	 hand.	 Detective Haldi.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>She	held	a	tranquilizer	gun	in	her	hand.	Pati	had	not	experienced	being	shot by	 one	 before,	 and	 she’d	 rarely	 seen	 the	 weapon,	 except	 when	 Richard	 had security	personnel	around.	The	weapon	meant	that	she	was	in	their	power,	right now,	and	cooperation	would	be	in	her	best	interest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ms.	 McLear,”	 Detective	 Haldi	 said.	 She	 had	 a	 higher	 voice	 than	 her	 size suggested.	 “I’m	 not	 an	 Earth-born	 like	 yourself,	 so	 I’m	 not	 confident	 I	 can overcome	 you	 physically.	 That	 said,	 I’m	 going	 to	 keep	 this	 weapon	 trained	 on you	 until	 you’re	 in	 the	 back	 of	 our	 groundcar.	 If	 you	 move	 in	 any	 way	 that suggests	 violence	 or	 flight,	 I’ll	 disable	 you	 with	 this	 weapon.	 Do	 you understand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	please	lead	us	out	of	the	door.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 obeyed,	 stepping	 out	 of	 the	 great	 room	 onto	 the	 street.	 The	 two detectives	 followed,	 and	 then	 Detective	 Bennett	 turned	 to	 shut	 the	 door.	 He tapped	a	button	on	his	handheld.	“I’m	securing	this	door,	and	you’ll	be	able	to enter	when	you	return.	No	one	else	will	be	able	to,	so	your	possessions	will	be safe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Detective	Bennett	took	the	lead	and	marched	to	the	groundcar	parked	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cul-de-sac.	 Pati	 could	 see	 busy	 traffic	 at	 the	 intersection	 with	 the	 main	 road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nobody	on	the	street	was	staring,	at	least	not	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can	enter	the	car,”	Detective	Haldi	said.	The	right-rear	door	opened	up, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 Pati	 climbed	 in.	 The	 door	 shut	 behind	 her.	 She	 didn’t	 bother	 seeing	 if	 she could	open	it	from	her	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 pair	 slid	 into	 the	 front	 seats	 with	 Detective	 Bennett	 on	 the	 left.	 He tapped	buttons	on	the	dash,	and	the	car	turned	and	rolled	toward	Main	Street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 recalled	 her	 question	 about	 needing	 legal	 representation,	 to	 which Detective	Bennett	replied	in	the	negative.	She	would	not	trust	him	or	the	other detectives	again. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Pati	 took	 a	 groundcar	 on	 her	 way	 to	 an	 office	 building	 near	 the	 center	 of Karakorum.	 Karakorum	 was	 the	 only	 large	 settlement	 on	 Titan,	 and	 like	 most everything	 else	 on	 Titan,	 it	 was	 constructed	 by	 McLear	 Industries.	 A	 fact	 that reinforced	her	decision	not	to	cooperate	with	the	detectives,	who	were	forced	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>release	her.	It	also	reinforced	her	decision	to	get	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stopped	at	an	office	building	that	housed	most	of	the	lawyers	on	Titan, </p>
<p class="calibre1">leaving	 the	 groundcar	 to	 park	 itself	 and	 wait	 for	 her	 return.	 It	 was	 9	 a.m.	 on Monday,	 four	 days	 after	 Richard’s	 death.	 Pati	 tried	 on	 Friday	 to	 contact	 his brother	on	Picus.	He	didn’t	accept	the	call,	and	she	decided	she	might	need	legal help.	 She	 found	 the	 service	 for	 assigning	 attorneys	 and	 sent	 in	 a	 request.	 A response	was	received	within	a	few	hours,	setting	a	meeting	for	this	morning	in this	location. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	section	of	Karakorum	was	primarily	office	structures,	and	the	business</p>
<p class="calibre1">feel	was	unmistakable.	Most	of	the	buildings	were	three	to	four	stories	high	and built	 like	 boxes	 with	 a	 variable	 number	 of	 rooms	 on	 each	 floor.	 And	 like	 her home	here,	they	were	set	in	a	cul-de-sac	intersecting	the	main	street. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati’s	destination	was	on	the	right	side	of	the	street,	near	the	end.	She	entered the	 building	 down	 a	 walkway	 that	 bisected	 it	 in	 the	 center.	 Inside,	 she	 saw	 a receptionist	 speaking	 into	 a	 headset.	 Pati	 approached,	 and	 the	 receptionist noticed	her,	but	she	didn’t	stop	her	conversation.	A	second	later,	the	receptionist connected	the	person	to	their	destination	and	turned	to	Pati. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	I	help	you?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	need	to	see	Nancy	Tate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	on	this	floor.	Use	the	left	hallway	from	the	atrium,	middle	door	on	the right	side	of	that	hallway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,”	Pati	said	and	stepped	around	her	desk.	She	entered	an	atrium	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 ceiling	 window	 to	 the	 outside	 of	 Karakorum.	 She	 could	 imagine	 on	 clearer days	 when	 the	 sun	 was	 in	 the	 right	 position,	 there	 would	 be	 natural	 light streaming	 in,	 almost	 like	 on	 Earth.	 It	 was	 the	 same	 for	 the	 deck	 above	 her house’s	shuttle	hangar,	and	it	was	a	wonderful	luxury.	The	only	problem	was	that such	 days	 rarely	 happened,	 only	 a	 few	 times	 a	 year.	 Another	 reason	 for	 her	 to return	to	the	real	thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	turned	into	the	left	hallway	and	strode	across	the	white,	polished	stone, another	luxury	item.	There	were	three	wooden	doors	on	each	side	of	the	hallway and	one	at	the	end.	She	expected	the	wood	was	false,	a	synthetic	built	from	the organics	 on	 Titan,	 because	 the	 real	 stuff	 would	 cost	 a	 year’s	 salary,	 even	 for these	lawyers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	middle	door	on	the	right	side	had	a	nameplate	for	“Nancy	Tate”	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">left	of	the	door.	Pati	didn’t	see	a	button,	so	she	knocked,	finding	the	door	to	be metal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	in,”	she	heard	a	female	voice	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	turned	the	metallic	lever	down	and	pushed	open	the	door.	She	stepped	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	find	an	office	with	blue	walls,	a	white	tile	ceiling,	and	lighter-blue	floors.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>desk	looked	like	wood,	and	a	lady	stood	on	the	other	side,	holding	out	her	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 must	 be	 Pati	 McLear,”	 she	 said,	 shaking	 Pati’s	 hand.	 Nancy	 Tate	 had blonde	 hair	 tied	 back	 and	 blue	 eyes.	 She	 also	 stood	 at	 least	 a	 decimeter	 taller than	 Pati,	 suggesting	 she	 was	 a	 second-generation,	 or	 secgen	 for	 short.	 Her parents	would	have	immigrated	to	Titan,	or	somewhere	in	the	solar	system	other than	Earth,	and	growing	up	in	lower	gravity	made	her	taller	than	Earth-borns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	wore	a	beige	business	suit	while	Pati	was	in	gray,	wearing	a	suit	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">casual	than	Nancy’s.	This	year	had	been	hell	between	Richard	and	her,	and	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t	 quite	 feel	 the	 part	 of	 a	 grieving	 widow,	 so	 wearing	 black	 every	 day would	not	happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks	for	meeting	with	me	on	such	short	notice,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	volunteered	for	your	case	as	soon	as	you	sent	it	into	the	pool	last	Friday,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	said.	“No	one	else	with	my	experience	and	credentials	was	interested,	and I	 got	 the	 case.	 Within	 minutes	 of	 the	 assignment,	 the	 lawyers	 for	 McLear Industries	 deluged	 me	 with	 information.”	 She	 took	 a	 deep	 breath.	 “We	 have	 a busy	morning	ahead	of	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	did	the	company	get	involved?	I	thought	this	was	about	protecting	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	prosecution.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	took	another	deep	breath.	“It	will	be	more	than	that,	and	right	now,	I	can handle	both	ends	for	you.	The	first	thing	to	know	is	McLear	is	paying	your	bills and	not	just	my	fees	for	the	time	being.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 understood.	 It’d	 been	 a	 tense	 and	 busy	 weekend,	 and	 she	 hadn’t bothered	to	consider	how	she’d	pay	her	bills.	She	never	needed	to	worry	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">expenses	 since	 she	 left	 Earth;	 everything	 was	 taken	 care	 of	 by	 Richard	 and	 his family.	She	was	only	twenty-two	then,	and	only	a	few	days	from	turning	twenty-four	today.	Living	on	her	own	was	not	a	lifestyle	she	was	used	to.	Having	Kerry McLear	 continue	 to	 pay	 her	 bills	 was	 a	 nice	 gesture,	 but	 what	 was	 the	 catch? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	what	does	that	all	mean,	then?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please,	sit	down,”	Nancy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	took	the	chair	on	the	right	in	front	of	Nancy’s	desk.	Nancy	sat	down	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	start	with	what	the	McLear	lawyers	provided	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it	anyone	in	particular	you’re	working	with?”	Pati	asked.	“I’ve	met	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">chief	counsel	before,	although	it	was	just	an	introduction	and	nothing	more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 wasn’t	 her.	 It	 came	 from	 one	 of	 their	 paralegals.	 Their	 position	 is	 that you,	Pati	McLear,	will	no	longer	be	part	of	their	organization.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	didn’t	say	family.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 although	 it’s	 implied.	 The	 indications	 are	 that	 they	 will	 support	 you through	this	time,	financially.	After	your	legal	issues	are	cleaned	up,	you’re	on</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>your	own.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 didn’t	 fret.	 Had	 this	 been	 a	 year	 ago,	 when	 she	 had	 some	 love	 for	 this place,	 it	 might	 have	 caused	 her	 some	 concern.	 But	 after	 Richard	 became	 an abusive,	violent	spouse,	she	wanted	to	get	back	to	Earth	and	leave	it	all	behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	probably	that	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	other	hand,	she	was	a	legal	member	of	that	family,	even	if	she	wasn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">treated	like	it.	“I’m	not	surprised	they’re	taking	that	attitude.	They	had	Richard’s body	transported	to	Picus	within	hours,	and	I	wasn’t	allowed	to	go	there	for	the service	they	held	yesterday.	His	brother	wouldn’t	take	my	calls,	either.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	looked	down	at	her	desk.	“Kerry	McLear	wouldn’t	even	let	you	attend</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	funeral	for	your	husband.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	knew	we’d	been	fighting,	and	I	could	tell	they	didn’t	get	along	either,	at least	not	in	the	last	year.	They	seemed	distant	even	before	then,	so	I	don’t	know why	he’s	suddenly	become	the	loving	and	hurt	family	member.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	bad	did	you	want	to	be	there?”	Nancy	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	had	to	think.	After	failing	to	get	passage	up	to	Picus	on	Saturday	for	the Sunday	 funeral,	 she	 tried	 again	 to	 contact	 Kerry.	 When	 that	 failed,	 she	 felt relieved	that	she’d	done	all	she	could	to	do	as	a	wife.	The	fight	with	Richard,	the detectives	taking	her	into	custody,	and	the	last	three	nightmares	had	all	taken	a toll.	 Having	 to	 deal	 with	 Kerry	 McLear	 would	 have	 added	 to	 the	 cost.	 She wasn’t	sad	to	have	had	a	free	Sunday.	“Okay,	it	wasn’t	the	worst	thing	that	could happen	to	me.”	Pati	thought	for	a	second.	“What	is,	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 that	 depends	 on	 how	 we	 resolve	 the	 case	 filed	 by	 the	 state	 against you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	detectives	said	they	would	not	hold	me	after	they	searched	my	house.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 weren’t	 exactly	 a	 flight	 risk,	 Pati,”	 Nancy	 said.	 She	 sat	 back	 in	 her chair.	“The	state	hasn’t	assigned	a	prosecutor	because	they’re	not	as	agile	as	the McLear	lawyers.	I	expect	sometime	tomorrow	we’ll	find	out	who	gets	your	case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,	 despite	 their	 glacial	 pace,	 I	 was	 able	 to	 obtain	 the	 investigator’s records	and	recommendations.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	finished?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	detectives	are.	They’ve	documented	that	the	physical	evidence	matches</p>
<p class="calibre1">perfectly	with	your	statements.	They	also	found	it	odd	there	were	no	recordings of	the	event.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Richard	 would	 not	 have	 recorders	 in	 the	 house,	 even	 for	 security.	 At	 least not	during	regular	days.	If	we	had	people	over,	he’d	do	it.	It	just	wasn’t	a	normal thing	for	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	did	not	allege	it	was	an	action	on	your	part,	so	it’s	not	a	problem	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">need	 to	 deal	 with.	 The	 case,	 from	 what	 I	 can	 see,	 will	 not	 be	 about	 what</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>happened.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’ll	be	about	what	happens	to	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 and	 unfortunately,	 the	 detectives	 recommended	 a	 human-slaughter</p>
<p class="calibre1">charge.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati’s	stomach	fell.	“That	doesn’t	sound	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 not	 a	 murder	 charge,	 but	 you’re	 right,	 it’s	 not	 good.	 Let	 me	 ask	 you	 a question,	did	you	have	your	eye	looked	at?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	haven’t	had	problems	with	my	vision.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 not	 what	 I	 meant.	 In	 your	 statement	 to	 the	 detectives	 at	 the	 station, you	said	Richard	McLear	struck	you	across	the	face,	using	the	back	of	his	right hand.	 That	 contact	 with	 your	 orbital	 bone	 caused	 you	 to	 lose	 your	 temper	 and strike	back.	Did	anyone	check	for	a	bruise	on	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 reached	 up	 to	 her	 eye.	 She	 felt	 a	 slight	 amount	 of	 pain	 pushing	 where Richard	struck	her.	“I	didn’t	think	to	have	it	checked.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	still	feel	some	pain?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	slight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	 a	 physician	 I	 know	 nearby	 who	 we’ll	 visit	 as	 soon	 as	 we’re	 done here.	I	know	the	detectives	took	your	word	for	it.	However,	if	the	state	assigns one	 of	 their	 better	 attorneys,	 they’ll	 call	 into	 question	 whether	 or	 not	 Richard McLear	struck	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	would	they	do	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	 weaken	 your	 defense.	 Make	 us	 happy	 to	 accept	 a	 human-slaughter</p>
<p class="calibre1">charge	 because	 it’s	 possible	 your	 action	 was	 premeditated,	 and	 there’s	 no evidence	to	prove	otherwise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Other	than	my	bruise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Correct,	and	if	you’re	still	feeling	pain,	he	must	have	hit	you	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	shrugged.	“Not	that	bad,	he	just	hit	a	soft	spot	and	I	felt	more	pain	than normal.	If	he’d	hit	my	cheek,	well,	I	wouldn’t	have	hit	him	as	I	did.	Maybe	just pushed	 him	 over	 like	 I’d	 done	 before,	 making	 sure	 he	 didn’t	 go	 toward	 that stupid	pillar	in	the	house.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	another	issue.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me	being	an	Earth-born.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 fortunately,	 it’s	 not	 a	 law	 that	 Earth-borns	 have	 to	 receive	 greater punishments	 for	 physical	 violence	 here.	 It’s	 just	 implied	 that	 you	 have	 to	 be more	careful	when	dealing	with	your	anger	than	secgens.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	 well,	 how	 many	 times	 do	 I	 have	 to	 get	 hit	 before	 I	 respond?”	 Pati asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>“Which	 is	 a	 point	 I’ll	 make	 in	 the	 negotiations.	 There’s	 no	 reason	 why	 we should	go	to	trial	since	all	the	evidence	demonstrates	self-defense	during	a	fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	the	state’s	attorney	tries	to	impose	a	severe	sentence,	we’ll	prevail.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	happens	to	me?	I	mean,	what	kind	of	sentence	do	you	think	I’ll	wind</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	serving?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	thought	for	a	second.	“I	don’t	like	to	predict,	but	I	think	we	can	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 charges	 dropped	 in	 exchange	 for	 you	 leaving	 Karakorum	 and	 returning	 to Earth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	tried	to	see	the	negatives	in	her	proposal.	“That’s	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 just	 the	 result	 of	 the	 criminal	 charges.	 There	 will	 be	 additional negotiations	with	the	McLears.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	you	said	I’m	cut	off	after	we	resolve	my	legal	issues.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	 the	 charges	 are	 dropped,	 that	 makes	 you	 Richard	 McLear’s	 widow	 and legal	 heir.	 Then,	 you’ll	 have	 a	 new	 set	 of	 legal	 issues	 to	 deal	 with,	 which	 are better	 than	 the	 criminal	 ones.	 It	 won’t	 be	 about	 them	 supporting	 you.	 It’ll	 be about	how	much	of	that	company	you	own.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 had	 to	 wrap	 her	 brain	 around	 the	 revelation.	 Part	 owner	 of	 McLear Industries,	 one	 of	 the	 wealthiest	 and	 most	 powerful	 companies	 in	 the	 solar system.	“That’s	nice,”	she	said,	“except	I’d	rather	get	back	to	Earth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	be	on	your	way	back	to	Earth	while	I	handle	the	negotiations.	After</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	finish	with	the	criminal	charges,	we	can	sit	down	and	discuss	what	you	want from	a	settlement.”	Nancy	sat	forward	and	looked	Pati	in	the	eyes.	“Although	I have	to	advise	you	now	if	you	want	half	of	that	corporation,	it	will	take	a	very long	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	nothing	like	that,”	Pati	said.	“I	just	want	to	get	home	and	maybe	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough	to	live	on	for	a	while.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 think	 we	 can	 exceed	 your	 expectations,	 then,”	 Nancy	 said.	 She	 sat	 back again.	“Where	are	you	from	on	Earth?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	an	island	in	Western	Europe	called	Ireland.	We’re	about	as	far	west	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	can	get	there,	a	place	called	Dingle.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	heard	of	Ireland,	that’s	about	it,	though.	What’s	it	like?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	live	on	the	ocean.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	you	have	beaches	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	like	the	ones	you’re	thinking	of.	The	weather	isn’t	always	so	warm,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s	cloudy	like	here	on	Titan.	My	family	has	a	fishing	boat,	and	we	catch	fish	the ancient	ways	instead	of	manufacturing	food	from	raw	materials.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow,	how	was	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	nasty	doing	the	work,	although	the	fish	tastes	better	to	me,	even	though I	know	most	people	can’t	tell	the	difference.	My	father	has	been	using	robots	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>last	few	years	because	none	of	my	brothers	or	sister	wants	to	take	on	the	family business.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	too	bad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	as	I	said,	it’s	nasty	work.	Deal	with	odors	that	you	never	have	up	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everywhere	I	go	here	seems	so	clean.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	what	I’m	used	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	so	what’s	your,	ah,	where	you	from?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 grew	 up	 in	 Karakorum.	 My	 parents	 emigrated	 from	 Earth’s	 moon,	 and they	got	jobs	drilling	in	the	oil	fields.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Drilling,	I	thought—"	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	they	just	called	it	that	because	it’s	like	drilling	for	oil	on	Earth.	They’d ride	 out	 on	 helicopters	 and	 assist	 ships	 that	 landed	 to	 fill	 up	 with	 the	 methane and	 ethane	 liquids.	 The	 locals	 here	 called	 it	 oil,	 because,	 well,	 it’s	 close	 to	 the same	thing.	At	least	that’s	what	my	parents	told	me.	They	also	told	me	I	would not	 be	 doing	 the	 same	 work	 when	 I	 grew	 up.	 My	 education	 was	 one	 of	 their priorities	in	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that	why	you	became	a	lawyer,	because	they	wanted	you	to?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	wanted	me	to	go	into	chemistry.	When	I	told	them	I	was	interested	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">law,	they	loved	it,	until	they	found	out	the	expense.	God	love	them,	though,	they took	it	in	stride	and	helped	me	finish	early.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Finished	early,”	Pati	said,	“that’s	impressive.	How	old	are	you	now,	if	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t	mind	me	asking?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	smiled.	“Thirty-five.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	look	younger	than	me,	and	I’m	twenty-four.”	Pati	held	up	her	hand	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">stop	Nancy	from	commenting.	“I	know,	it’s	the	low	gravity.	All	of	you	look	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">young	I	can’t	ever	tell	how	old	you	are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	little	different,	I’m	sure,”	Nancy	said.	She	had	a	timepiece	on	her	left wrist,	which	she	checked.	“I	think	my	physician	friend	arrives	at	his	office	in	a few	minutes.	Let’s	walk	over	and	see	him	before	he	can	take	any	patients.	Then we	can	come	back	and	finish	our	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,”	 Pati	 said	 and	 stood	 up.	 She	 followed	 Nancy	 out	 of	 her	 office	 door and	into	the	hallway.	She	couldn’t	help	feeling	confident	about	her	future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>Pati	 heard	 the	 front	 doorbell	 ring.	 It	 was	 late	 in	 the	 afternoon,	 and	 she’d	 spent most	 of	 the	 day	 working	 with	 Nancy	 Tate.	 She’d	 gone	 home	 when	 they	 were finished,	 heading	 straight	 to	 the	 kitchen	 to	 get	 a	 meal	 after	 arriving.	 The	 bell rang	before	she	made	it	to	the	dining	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 returned	 to	 the	 door	 and	 activated	 the	 exterior	 camera.	 A	 small	 screen displayed	the	visitor:	a	short	lady,	not	so	young,	and	not	yet	middle	age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	I	help	you?”	Pati	asked,	through	the	intercommunications	circuit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	came	the	reply.	“I’m	Connie	Pearson,	with	the	Titan	News	Network.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">am	looking	for	Pati	McLear.	Would	you	be	her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unsure	of	what	to	say,	while	not	worried	either,	she	responded.	“Yes,	that’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	have	a	few	minutes	to	answer	some	questions?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	getting	ready	to	eat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	could	come	back	in	an	hour.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	sure	I’ll	be	done	eating.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Two	hours,	then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 didn’t	 want	 to	 see	 her	 then,	 either.	 However,	 she	 decided	 it	 would	 be better	 to	 let	 her	 in	 now,	 just	 to	 see	 what	 she	 wanted.	 Pati	 opened	 the	 door manually	and	noticed	the	lady	was	shorter	than	she	was.	“Yes,	I’m	Pati	McLear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	Connie	Pearson.	Can	I	come	in?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,	this	way.”	Pati	led	her	into	the	great	room	toward	a	chair	for	them	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">sit	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Connie	stopped	along	the	way.	“This	is	where	Richard	McLear	died.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	didn’t	think	her	statement	was	tactful,	especially	when	the	widow	was	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	room.	“Yes,	he	died	here.”	Pati	walked	back	to	her	instead	of	offering	her	a seat.	“I’m	not	sure	I	can	speak	about	this	without	consulting	my	attorney.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s	your	attorney?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nancy	Tate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	been	around	a	while,	even	before	I	got	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 from	 Earth,”	 Pati	 guessed.	 She	 was	 a	 decimeter	 shorter	 than	 Pati, and	Pati	decided	she	could	not	have	grown	that	short	in	low	gravity.	She	also	had medium-brown	hair,	pulled	back	in	a	business	look,	and	wore	simple	casual	blue slacks	and	a	matching	shirt	with	a	subdued	pattern.	Not	quite	business	dress	at Karakorum,	yet	not	down	to	the	casual	level	either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I’m	from	the	east	coast	of	North	America.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	from	Ireland	in	West	Europe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,	your	wedding	was	big	news	here	on	Titan,	and	I	reviewed	your	bio</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	then.	And	we	usually	know	what	the	McLears	are	doing,	since	their	actions can	affect	everyone	on	Titan.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>“I	see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	it’s	really	important	I	get	to	talk	to	you,	hear	what	happened	from	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">mouth,	because	I	can’t	always	trust	city	hall	to	give	me	the	correct	story.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	 not	 much	 to	 tell,	 at	 least	 nothing	 I	 didn’t	 tell	 the	 medical technicians.	There	has	to	be	a	public	record	you	have	access	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then,	you’re	saying	you	killed	Richard	McLear	in	self-defense.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	wouldn’t	be	caught.	“No,	just	that	I	don’t	think	I	can	help	you	with	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">new	information.	Especially	since	I	haven’t	talked	to	my	lawyer	about	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Connie	smiled.	“How	long	before	you	can	do	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	talk	to	her	tomorrow,	or	at	least	try	to	contact	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	been	told	you’ll	be	tried	for	Richard	McLear’s	death,	is	this	true?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 shook	 her	 head.	 “I	 can’t	 say	 one	 way	 or	 the	 other.”	 Nancy	 was	 still waiting	on	the	word	from	the	state	attorney’s	office	on	what	they	planned	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 said	 they	 moved	 at	 a	 glacial	 pace,	 so	 it	 wasn’t	 concerning	 that	 when	 they finished	for	the	day,	she’d	not	been	notified	of	any	action	on	their	part. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	don’t	plan	to	try	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 I	 just	 don’t	 know	 yet,	 so	 you’ll	 need	 to	 speak	 with	 the	 prosecutors	 if they’ve	made	that	decision	by	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Connie	nodded.	“I’ll	talk	with	them	tomorrow.	They’re	not	usually	working</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	late,	at	least	most	of	them.	I’d	think	if	you	have	Jack	Reagan	assigned	to	the case,	he’d	have	spoken	to	your	lawyer	by	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	 of	 the	 assistant	 prosecutors.	 He	 should	 be	 the	 chief	 prosecutor	 in	 that office	soon,	but	that	won’t	be	your	concern.”	Connie	pulled	out	a	handheld	and reviewed	 the	 screen.	 She	 put	 it	 back.	 “Okay,	 would	 you	 mind	 if	 I	 contact	 you tomorrow,	and	maybe	we	can	meet	in	the	afternoon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 guess	 so,	 but	 I	 can’t	 promise	 we’ll	 be	 able	 to	 meet.	 As	 I	 said,	 I	 want	 to clear	it	with	Nancy	Tate	before	I	give	you	a	statement.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Understood,	thanks	for	your	time.”	Connie	stepped	to	the	door	and	waited</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	Pati	to	let	her	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	did	not	hesitate	to	comply,	and	she	leaned	against	the	door	after	she	shut it	manually.	“I	really	can’t	wait	to	get	back	to	Earth,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a><b class="calibre2">2	Cutting	a	Deal</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 rarely	 entered	 Richard’s	 office.	 Even	 though	 he	 spent	 most	 of	 his	 time working	on	Picus,	taking	the	shuttle	from	their	private	dock	up	and	back	every day,	it	was	his	space.	Today,	however,	the	space	could	be	useful	for	Pati. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 room	 was	 small,	 maybe	 three	 meters	 square	 and	 just	 over	 two	 meters tall.	High	enough	for	a	secgen	to	stand	comfortably.	It	had	a	desk	facing	a	large viewscreen,	with	two	monitors	on	the	desk.	A	few	pictures	were	attached	to	the walls	that	showed	Pati	in	happier	times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 had	 been	 a	 stormy	 six	 months	 since	 the	 beginning	 of	 the	 year.	 Whatever happened	to	change	Richard,	happened	around	that	time.	Before	then,	he	was	the perfect	definition	of	a	prince.	She	shook	her	head,	wondering	how	it	could	have all	gone	so	wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	remembered	how	her	old	boyfriend,	Jerry,	decided	he	wanted	to	go	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">different	direction	with	his	life.	Given	that	today	he	still	lived	in	her	hometown of	 Dingle,	 Ireland,	 he	 didn’t	 change	 his	 direction	 too	 much.	 To	 a	 twenty-one-year-old	girl,	though,	the	world	had	just	ended. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 surprisingly	 didn’t,	 and	 a	 week	 later,	 she	 changed	 her	 profile	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">“available.”	 Pati	 received	 numerous	 inquiries	 the	 next	 week,	 most	 of	 whom should	 not	 have	 made	 it	 through	 the	 filters.	 When	 she	 got	 to	 Richard’s,	 he seemed	like	a	good	guy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 only	 listed	 his	 last	 name,	 age,	 and	 a	 few	 interests	 with	 the	 required pictures	 and	 proof	 of	 authenticity.	 His	 last	 name	 was	 McLear,	 without mentioning	that	he	was	one	of	the	“McLears.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 exchanged	 messages	 the	 following	 week.	 Despite	 not	 talking	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">realtime,	 she	 had	 a	 better	 feeling	 about	 him	 than	 she	 did	 with	 the	 local	 guys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 he	 said	 he’d	 be	 on	 Earth’s	 moon	 in	 a	 few	 weeks	 and	 asked	 if	 she	 could meet	him.	When	he	didn’t	hesitate	to	cover	her	trip	costs,	she	suspected	his	last name	 stood	 for	 more	 than	 identification.	 And	 when	 they	 met,	 there	 was	 too much	about	him	to	deny	he	was	from	that	rich	and	powerful	family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	 struck	 her	 the	 most,	 though,	 was	 their	 chemistry.	 They	 spent	 a	 day together,	and	she	continually	lost	herself	in	their	conversation.	The	day	went	by like	 an	 hour,	 and	 on	 her	 way	 back	 to	 Earth,	 she	 could	 only	 think	 of	 how	 just being	with	him	felt.	It	was	so	wonderful	that	she	thought	his	wealth	would	be	a hindrance	to	their	relationship.	She	wanted	to	be	with	him	every	day,	and	the	day after	their	date	felt	like	being	weaned	from	pain	killers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>The	wealth	actually	facilitated	their	relationship.	He	brought	her	back	to	the moon	for	another	date	before	he	returned	to	Titan.	It	was	better	than	the	first,	and Pati	knew	he	took	the	slower	ship	back	just	so	they	could	talk	in	realtime	longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 only	 misfortune	 was	 that	 when	 he	 proposed,	 she	 couldn’t	 answer	 him immediately	and	hug	him	as	she	wanted.	She	had	to	be	content	that	if	she	didn’t get	the	proposal	of	her	dreams,	she	at	least	got	the	guy	she	dreamed	of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	only	problem	had	been	moving	to	Titan	where	they’d	have	the	wedding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard	offered	to	transport	her	whole	family	on	a	fast	cruise	to	Titan	and	return them	as	soon	as	possible.	That	would	be	massively	expensive	yet	pocket	change</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	his	family.	The	one	thing	they	couldn’t	purchase	was	the	time	away,	at	least six	 months.	 Her	 father	 couldn’t	 leave	 the	 fishing	 business,	 nor	 could	 the	 rest leave	their	jobs	for	that	time.	Her	mom	and	sister	made	it,	and	it	killed	her	when they	had	to	return.	The	room	they	stayed	in	was	across	the	hall,	and	Pati	cried	for an	hour	there	after	they	returned	to	Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 got	 over	 it	 and	 couldn’t	 complain	 about	 her	 new	 rich	 and	 famous lifestyle.	 The	 new	 world	 was	 always	 interesting,	 even	 if	 it	 was	 confining.	 Last year	was	a	wonderful	time	in	her	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	shook	her	head	and	looked	back	at	the	wall	to	the	picture	of	Richard	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 family.	 Pati	 barely	 knew	 his	 parents.	 After	 the	 wedding,	 they	 traveled	 to Earth’s	moon	and	stayed	there	until	their	deaths	later	in	the	year.	It	shocked	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard,	however,	seemed	less	affected.	It	was	maybe	a	few	months	after	that	his moods	and	actions	changed	for	the	worse,	and	she	assumed	his	parent’s	deaths</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	the	reasons	for	his	abusiveness.	When	he	didn’t	change	back,	she	no	longer thought	about	root	causes,	only	about	her	survival. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 only	 other	 family	 member	 was	 his	 brother,	 Kerry.	 He	 was	 a	 few	 years older	and	became	the	primary	executive	in	McLear	Industries	when	his	parents</p>
<p class="calibre1">left.	 When	 she	 first	 met	 Kerry,	 he	 seemed	 cold,	 and	 he	 wasn’t	 much	 better	 to Richard.	 After	 Richard	 changed,	 Pati	 never	 saw	 them	 together	 outside	 of business.	When	she	grew	up,	she	wished	her	family	could	be	wealthy	in	a	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	the	McLears.	The	downside	to	such	life	was	all	too	apparent	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	took	a	seat	at	the	desk.	She	activated	the	large	viewscreen	and	tapped	the controls	to	find	Richard’s	account.	It	was	no	longer	available.	Pati	surmised	the McLear	Industries	personnel	had	erased	Richard’s	information	from	this	control. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	always	efficient. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	need	his	account	though;	she	wanted	more	information	on	McLear</p>
<p class="calibre1">Industries,	since	she	might	be	asking	for	some	of	that	business.	She	announced that	fact	to	the	controls,	and	an	article	from	Titan	News	Network	appeared	from five	years	ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 story	 began	 in	 2055	 with	 the	 invention	 of	 fusion-drive	 for	 space</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>vehicles.	 Spacecraft	 holding	 dozens	 of	 people	 then	 traveled	 to	 Mars	 and	 the moons	 of	 Jupiter	 to	 land	 and	 explore.	 Settlements	 were	 established	 on	 Earth’s moon	 and	 on	 satellites	 just	 outside	 Earth’s	 atmosphere.	 Earth	 supplied	 these settlements,	 and	 the	 settlements	 returned	 valuable	 materials	 like	 Titanium, Helium-3,	and	stuff	you	had	to	make	in	zero/low	gravity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	McLears	owned	steel	manufacturing	factories	around	the	Great	Lakes	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">North	America.	John	McLear	was	the	chief	executive,	and	he	sank	money	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">developing	a	space	probe	that	had	nothing	to	do	with	making	steel.	Stockholders voiced	 their	 displeasure,	 but	 as	 he	 had	 a	 majority	 stake	 in	 his	 company,	 he	 got what	he	wanted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 investment	 showed	 no	 signs	 of	 return	 when	 they	 launched	 in	 2075. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within	a	few	years,	the	probe	landed	on	a	picked	asteroid	and	gave	it	a	push.	It hadn’t	moved	very	far	when	the	probe	ran	out	of	propellant,	but	it	was	enough.	It was	 then	 that	 John	 McLear	 revealed	 his	 plans.	 The	 mission	 was	 to	 move	 the iron-nickel	asteroid,	which	rivaled	a	small	moon	in	mass,	into	a	new	orbit	so	it would	rendezvous	with	Saturn	in	thirty-two	years	and	seven	months. </p>
<p class="calibre1">John	 McLear	 was	 ninety-one-years	 old.	 His	 son,	 Bill,	 took	 over	 after	 the stockholders	revolted.	Bill	McLear	sunk	more	money	into	their	space	program, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sending	equipment	and	material	to	the	asteroid	on	its	way	to	Saturn.	He	was	in his	sixties	at	the	time,	and	in	his	mid-nineties	when	the	asteroid	reached	Saturn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	remained	in	charge	of	McLear	Industries,	while	his	daughter,	Jamie	McLear, </p>
<p class="calibre1">traveled	to	the	asteroid	to	assume	control	there.	When	she	arrived,	the	equipment and	 personnel	 were	 in	 place,	 and	 she	 had	 the	 orbit	 manipulated	 so	 Saturn’s moon,	Titan,	caught	the	asteroid	in	its	gravitational	hold	and	made	it	a	satellite	of the	satellite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	when	the	real	work	began.	Jamie	McLear	held	a	press	conference</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	announced	she	had	assumed	control	of	McLear	Industries.	The	factories	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Earth	 would	 be	 sold,	 and	 the	 new	 company	 headquarters	 would	 move	 to	 the asteroid,	which	she	named	“Picus.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	facilities	on	Picus	were	zero-gravity	steel	factories	and	a	shipyard.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">asteroid	 provided	 iron	 and	 nickel,	 while	 carbon	 was	 available	 on	 Titan.	 The shipyard	built	space-tankers	with	the	manufactured	steel,	and	the	tankers	landed on	 Titan	 to	 fill	 their	 holds	 with	 liquid	 methane	 and	 other	 organics.	 Soon	 after, chemical	plants	were	built	on	Titan	to	include	the	equally	valuable	ammonia	in the	shipments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carbon	 and	 nitrogen	 were	 now	 available	 to	 all	 the	 settlements	 outside	 of Earth,	at	a	fraction	of	the	cost	it	took	to	launch	from	the	massive	Terran	gravity well.	 Those	 elements	 were	 necessary	 to	 supply	 what	 were	 now	 hundreds	 of millions	 of	 people	 living	 outside	 of	 Earth	 for	 their	 foodstuff	 processes.	 Jamie</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>McLear	 quickly	 cornered	 that	 market	 with	 her	 burgeoning	 space	 fleet.	 It	 took another	 five	 years	 for	 the	 money	 to	 roll	 in,	 but	 she	 was	 the	 most	 powerful merchant	in	the	solar	system	by	then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 stopped	 reading.	 She’d	 never	 met	 Richard’s	 grandmother;	 she’d	 died when	 he	 was	 in	 his	 twenties.	 Pati	 had	 heard	 the	 stories,	 though,	 and	 a	 more impressive	lady	she	couldn’t	imagine.	When	she	retired,	she	could	not	return	to Earth	 because	 gravity	 treatments	 for	 bone	 loss	 and	 other	 zero-gravity	 maladies had	 been	 developed	 too	 late	 in	 her	 life.	 She	 lived	 the	 rest	 of	 her	 hundred	 plus years	on	Picus.	When	she	died,	Richard’s	father	sent	her	body	back	to	Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 resumed	 her	 research.	 In	 time,	 her	 body	 would	 also	 go	 back	 to	 Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Except,	Pati	would	still	be	living	in	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">They’d	slept	in	separate	rooms	for	most	of	the	last	year.	The	first	time	he	hit	her, she	kept	her	temper	and	told	him	to	get	out.	He	must	have	had	remorse	that	time because	he	walked	out	of	the	bedroom	and	took	his	shuttle	up	to	Picus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	didn’t	think	he	suffered,	since	the	home	the	McLears	lived	in	on	Picus</p>
<p class="calibre1">dwarfed	this	place.	When	he	came	home	the	next	day,	he	apologized.	He	never</p>
<p class="calibre1">apologized	again	after	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’d	been	a	long	Monday	for	Pati.	After	feeding	herself,	she	walked	upstairs</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 her	 bedroom.	 She	 used	 the	 low-gravity	 toilet,	 which	 was	 nowhere	 near	 as difficult	as	zero-gravity	toilets,	and	dressed	for	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 bedroom	 was	 done	 in	 bright	 colors,	 greens	 and	 oranges	 primarily.	 It reminded	 her	 of	 home.	 The	 emperor-size	 bed	 took	 up	 the	 center	 of	 the	 room, with	another	two	meters	around	each	side.	She	had	a	dressing	table,	which	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	used	when	she	needed	to	dress	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Turn	down	the	bed,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	blankets	were	folded	down	by	machinery	under	the	mattress.	Dressed	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 brown	 nightshirt,	 she	 got	 in	 and	 pulled	 a	 single	 sheet	 over	 her	 body.	 The blankets	 were	 her	 favorite	 wool,	 except	 tonight	 she	 felt	 warm	 and	 needed	 to dissipate	some	heat	from	her	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Low	lights,”	she	said.	The	lighting	diminished	to	a	level	she	had	preset	long ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	wasn’t	long,	and	she	could	tell	she	would	be	asleep.	Her	thoughts	drifted</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>and	made	less	sense.	She	rolled	on	to	her	left	side	and	faced	the	wall.	Someone was	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Except,	she	wasn’t	here,	or	she	wasn’t	in	her	bedroom	anymore.	She	stood, </p>
<p class="calibre1">downstairs	in	the	great	room,	and	Richard	stood	facing	her,	out	of	reach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	thought	nothing	of	seeing	Richard.	She	was	married	to	him,	and	he	lived</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	this	house	too.	Except,	he	was	all	gray,	and	his	clothes	were	black.	What	did that	mean?	He	stood	in	front	of	her,	not	moving.	She	wanted	to	walk	to	him,	and yet,	could	not.	She	stayed	in	her	position,	somewhere	in	the	great	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	should	not	have	hit	me,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	know	what	he	meant,	although	she	had	a	slight	memory	of	a	fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still,	she	couldn’t	remember	what	happened,	and	why	he	would	say	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	would	have	been	able	to	join	us,”	Richard	added.	“Except,	now,	you’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">ruined	everything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	wanted	to	tell	him	she	didn’t	care	what	he	wanted.	She	stayed	silent	as	if her	 body	 was	 detached	 from	 her	 mind.	 Then	 she	 saw	 herself	 standing	 next	 to Richard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	wore	all	black,	just	like	Richard.	And	she	looked	so	short	next	to	him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">like	all	their	pictures	together.	Unlike	him,	her	hair	was	black	and	straight	to	her shoulders.	 Her	 cheekbones	 betrayed	 a	 Nordic	 ancestry	 that	 invaded	 Western Ireland	many	hundreds	of	years	ago.	Her	frame	seemed	athletic,	even	though	she never	played	sports.	Her	reflection	did	not	move	or	show	expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	will	exact	payment	for	your	intrusion,”	Richard	said.	He	put	his	hand	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	shoulder,	and	she	collapsed.	Pati	saw	herself	on	the	ground,	next	to	a	pillar and	bleeding	gray	blood	from	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 felt	 as	 if	 about	 to	 lose	 her	 breath.	 Pati	 ran	 to	 the	 door	 and	 opened	 it, seeing	 the	 expanse	 of	 space,	 including	 Saturn,	 Titan,	 and	 Picus.	 A	 sun	 that resembled	a	large	star	stood	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 tried	 to	 stop,	 but	 she	 fell	 into	 a	 vortex	 sucking	 her	 down.	 She	 fought against	the	current	without	result.	Around	she	went.	She	finally	focused	on	the center	of	the	vortex	and	saw	a	golden-red	glow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	eyes	opened,	and	she	saw	the	ceiling	of	her	bedroom.	The	time	projected</p>
<p class="calibre1">showed	she’d	been	asleep	less	than	forty-five	minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Damn,”	she	said.	Pati	wanted	to	go	back	to	sleep,	except	her	breathing	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet	to	slow,	and	sweat	filled	her	nightshirt.	She	pushed	down	the	sheets	and	sat up.	 Her	 eyes	 adjusted	 to	 the	 low	 light,	 and	 she	 could	 see	 everything	 that	 was there	and	nothing	that	wasn’t	supposed	to	be	there.	The	colors	were	gone	in	the dim	light,	and	it	reminded	her	of	the	dream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Turn	the	lights	up	halfway,”	she	said.	The	lights	responded,	and	she	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	colors	in	her	room	again.	Pati	walked	to	the	dressing	table,	then	stared	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>mirror. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	look	different	from	the	corpse	she’d	seen	in	the	dream.	What	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	mean	to	see	yourself	dead	in	a	dream?	Was	this	her	brain	chastising	her	for	not feeling	more	pain	at	Richard’s	death? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	felt	the	bruise	on	her	right	eye	that	hadn’t	yet	healed.	He	hit	her,	and	she hit	him	back.	The	steel	pillar	killed	him,	not	her.	She	would	do	it	differently	if she	had	the	chance;	she	just	couldn’t	feel	hatred	for	herself	for	what	happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard	 took	 her	 from	 her	 family	 and	 became	 abusive	 when	 the	 honeymoon period	of	their	life	had	ended.	She’d	lost	her	love	for	him	months	ago.	There	was nothing	 missing	 in	 her	 life	 with	 him	 gone.	 Maybe	 because	 he	 had	 already	 left months	before	she	punched	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 arrived	 at	 Nancy’s	 office	 at	 9	 a.m.	 on	 Wednesday.	 This	 was	 the	 earliest Nancy	 could	 get	 on	 the	 prosecuting	 attorney’s	 calendar	 for	 a	 settlement conference.	 They	 took	 Pati’s	 groundcar	 to	 the	 municipal	 buildings	 just	 past Grand	 Center.	 It	 was	 a	 large,	 metallic	 building	 with	 several	 smaller	 buildings attached.	Even	less	extravagant	in	design	than	Nancy’s	building,	the	construction crews	had	built	identical	floors.	Like	Nancy’s	building,	they	walked	in	through the	center,	past	a	constable	working	security	for	the	public	facility. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	didn’t	ask	for	directions.	She	marched	to	the	rear	set	of	elevators.	She activated	the	elevator,	and	the	next	car	took	them	to	the	top	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	where	you’re	going?”	Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	too	well,”	Nancy	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	turned	right	off	the	elevator	and	proceeded	down	the	hallway.	At	least</p>
<p class="calibre1">eight	 doors	 lined	 each	 side,	 and	 Nancy	 continued	 to	 the	 door	 at	 the	 end.	 She stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nancy	Tate	and	client,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 door	 slid	 open	 to	 the	 right.	 Nancy	 led	 Pati	 into	 a	 normal	 if	 well-furnished	reception	area.	A	young	lady	with	blond	hair	like	Nancy’s	sat	to	their front,	wearing	a	headset	for	communications. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	an	appointment	with	Gavin	Keebler,”	Nancy	said	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	receptionist	nodded	and	held	up	a	finger	for	patience.	She	did	not	match</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy’s	eye	contact. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>“Yes,	I’ll	take	a	message,”	the	receptionist	said,	“thank	you,	goodbye.”	The receptionist	looked	at	Nancy.	“Ms.	Tate?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	know	where	his	office	is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Been	there	a	few	times,	so	you	need	not	get	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 receptionist	 nodded	 again,	 returning	 to	 the	 work	 on	 her	 desk.	 Nancy walked	 to	 the	 left	 and	 down	 a	 short	 hallway.	 She	 stopped	 on	 the	 first	 door	 to their	left	and	knocked.	The	door	opened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	strode	in.	Pati	followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks	for	meeting	on	such	short	notice,”	a	man	sitting	at	his	desk	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 office	 was	 longer	 than	 wide,	 and	 not	 much	 more	 room	 than	 could	 seat the	 occupant	 and	 two	 visitors.	 The	 seating	 matched	 the	 floorplan	 assessment, and	Nancy	took	one	of	the	two	chairs	across	from	the	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	Gavin,”	Nancy	said	to	him	while	extending	her	hand	across	the	desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stood	and	shook	her	hand.	“Thanks	for	being	here	on	such	short	notice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	noticed	he	was	serious	about	the	short	notice	statement.	She	also	noticed he	was	slightly	taller	than	her	and	much	older.	He	had	the	same	European	black hair	and	skin,	with	a	bit	more	weight.	She	would	have	guessed	him	as	an	Earth-born,	except	he	had	no	wrinkles	in	his	face.	Maybe	he	was	a	secgen	who	didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">grow	as	tall	as	most.	She	could	imagine	how	tiny	he’d	be	on	Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 this	 is	 Ms.	 McLear,”	 Gavin	 said.	 He	 went	 to	 shake	 her	 hand,	 which Pati	reciprocated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pati,	this	is	Gavin	Keebler,	the	state’s	attorney	for	your	case,”	Nancy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	to	meet	you,”	Pati	said.	Pati	went	to	sit	in	the	chair	next	to	Nancy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	please,	let’s	not	discuss	your	case	in	here,”	Gavin	said.	“Let’s	go	to	the conference	room.”	He	walked	around	his	desk,	led	them	out	of	the	door,	across</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	hallway,	and	through	the	door	opposite	his. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	conference	room	was	blander	than	Gavin’s	office.	A	metallic	table,	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 twelve,	 black,	 fabric-covered	 chairs	 surrounding.	 A	 large	 viewscreen covered	the	wall	to	the	left,	and	a	taller	chair	sat	at	the	head	of	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gavin	 walked	 to	 the	 head	 chair	 and	 sat	 down.	 Nancy	 took	 the	 chair	 on	 his right	and	beckoned	Pati	to	sit	next	to	her.	There	was	a	smaller	viewscreen	before each	seat	in	the	table.	Nancy	didn’t	touch	hers,	and	Pati	wasn’t	sure	what	she’d find	 if	 she	 touched	 hers.	 Gavin	 immediately	 tapped	 his,	 stared	 at	 it	 for	 a	 few moments,	and	looked	to	Nancy.	“Shall	I	go	through	the	charges?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	what	the	state	has	in	mind,	so	condense	it	for	my	client.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gavin	 shrugged.	 “Okay,	 in	 simple	 talk,	 we’re	 looking	 at	 human	 slaughter, first	degree.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	is	a	bit	overkill,”	Nancy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>“Except,	 she’s	 an	 Earth-born,	 and	 they	 have	 an	 added	 responsibility	 when physical	violence	is	an	issue.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Without	 a	 law	 to	 support	 it.	 You	 can’t	 make	 that	 a	 condition	 of	 your charges.”	 Nancy	 leaned	 back	 in	 her	 chair.	 “I	 rarely	 do	 this,	 but	 I’ll	 start	 with	 a proposal.	If	the	state	drops	the	charges,	my	client	will	return	to	Earth	on	the	first ship	 out	 of	 here.	 It	 won’t	 have	 to	 be	 the	 first	 ship	 that	 gets	 her	 back	 to	 Earth, either.	Whichever	one	leaves	next,	she’ll	be	on	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 loved	 the	 sound	 of	 it.	 Fortunately,	 through	 her	 research	 yesterday,	 she knew	 the	 next	 ship	 would	 have	 her	 home	 in	 about	 a	 year.	 The	 one	 after	 that would	 take	 five	 years.	 And	 four	 months	 from	 now,	 there	 was	 a	 fast	 ship	 that would	 get	 her	 home	 in	 three	 months.	 That	 would	 have	 her	 there	 the	 quickest, although	 she	 didn’t	 want	 to	 go	 into	 debt	 paying	 that	 fare.	 The	 first	 ship	 would have	her	home	six	months	later,	and	she	could	live	with	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gavin	sat	back.	“I	would	never	get	that	past	the	provost,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	hasn’t	retired	yet?”	Nancy	said.	“I	thought	she	was	done	with	that	job.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	scheduled	her	retirement	two	months	from	now.	Between	now	and	then, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	don’t	think	she	wants	a	significant	case	to	deal	with.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,	then	my	client	will	do	community	service	before	she	leaves.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	that	easy.	Since	one	of	the	McLears	is	dead,	we	have	to	worry	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">how	they	may	take	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 law	 is	 supposed	 to	 be	 blind	 to	 the	 wealth	 and	 social	 status	 of	 the citizens,”	Nancy	said.	“You	cannot	make	decisions	on	that	basis.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And,	I	am	not,”	Gavin	replied.	“Except,	if	we’re	choosing	a	sentence,	I	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 ensure	 I	 satisfy	 all	 interested	 parties	 to	 the	 extent	 possible.	 Even	 if	 the deceased	wasn’t	a	McLear,	the	next-of-kin	must	be	considered.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	feelings	of	the	next-of-kin	do	not	trump	the	rights	of	the	accused.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 true,	 however,	 my	 bosses	 and	 I	 don’t	 fare	 well	 when	 the	 next-kin’s feelings	are	neglected.	Sometimes	it’s	better	to	try	the	case	and	let	the	Judge	and Jury	decide.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Judge	and	jury?”	Pati	asked.	She’d	seen	two	courthouses	in	Karakorum,	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">near	here,	and	another	next	to	the	spaceport.	She’d	never	heard	of	any	judges	or juries	in	the	media,	let	alone	spoken	of	as	a	singular. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pati,	 I	 can	 explain.	 It’s	 a	 computer	 that	 does	 justice	 calculations.	 In	 small human	 settlements,	 it	 can	 be	 impossible	 to	 find	 enough	 people	 who	 have	 no relations	 to	 an	 accused	 or	 accuser.	 We	 consider	 these	 computers	 an	 acceptable alternative,	and	most	settlements	off	of	Earth	use	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 imagine	 your	 client	 is	 not	 familiar	 with	 our	 Long-Term	 Repatriation program,	either.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>Pati	 couldn’t	 see	 Nancy’s	 face,	 because	 she’d	 turned	 to	 see	 Mr.	 Keebler when	 he	 addressed	 her.	 Pati	 could	 see	 she	 had	 tightened	 up	 and	 didn’t	 respond immediately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	feel	the	need,	because	if	we	go	before	the	JJ,	she’ll	walk	away	free since	the	charges	you	bring	are	unsustainable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“May	I,	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	paused	once	more.	“Feel	free.	It’s	not	my	breath	being	wasted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gavin	 almost	 sneered,	 then	 he	 turned	 his	 attention	 to	 Pati.	 “Ms.	 McLear, Karakorum	has	never	had	the	facilities	for	housing	offenders	sentenced	to	multi-year	 incarcerations.	 So,	 similar	 to	 using	 a	 JJ	 for	 judgments	 and	 sentence determinations,	 we	 adopted	 the	 plan	 of	 Long-Term	 Repatriation	 for	 those people.”	He	paused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 Long-Term	 Repatriation	 involves	 sending	 offenders	 back	 to	 Earth	 to complete	 their	 sentences.	 Most	 shipping	 does	 not	 have	 facilities	 to	 house offenders,	so	special	spacecraft	have	been	manufactured	to	transport	them.	This allows	 the	 offender	 to	 serve	 most	 of	 their	 service	 aboard	 the	 craft	 while	 being transported.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Long	and	Short	Boats	we	sometimes	call	them,”	Nancy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	had	only	briefly	heard	those	terms	in	conversations	on	Titan.	She	never</p>
<p class="calibre1">asked	 for	 clarification	 because	 they	 used	 the	 terms	 in	 passing,	 and	 the	 people using	 quickly	 went	 on	 to	 other	 subjects.	 Somehow,	 she	 believed,	 finding	 the definitions	before	today	would	have	been	in	her	best	interest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Correct,	 that’s	 the	 given	 name	 of	 the	 craft.	 One	 is	 designed	 for	 a	 fifteen-year	 trip	 back	 to	 Earth.	 The	 other	 is	 designed	 for	 a	 thirty-year	 trip.	 Karakorum has	built	a	judicial	building	next	to	the	spaceport	that	docks	with	these	ships.	We have	 two	 of	 each	 parked	 at	 Karakorum,	 and	 unfortunately,	 five	 are	 in	 use traveling	back	to	Earth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	is	that?”	Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	three—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	need	to	go	into	any	details	for	my	client,”	Nancy	interrupted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	asked	the	question,	counselor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	okay,	Nancy,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	shook	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gavin	 waited	 a	 second	 and	 then	 continued.	 “We	 have	 three	 people	 on	 the thirty-year	 ships	 and	 have	 been	 gone	 eight,	 fourteen,	 and	 twenty-three	 years, respectively.	 There	 are	 two	 on	 the	 fifteen-year	 ships,	 six	 and	 thirteen	 years	 for them.	 They	 travel	 individually,	 without	 physical	 human	 contact	 for	 that	 time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’re	 capable	 of	 interacting	 electronically	 with	 most	 people	 and	 have	 access</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>to	 entertainment.	 That	 might	 end	 when	 they	 get	 to	 Earth	 and	 finish	 the	 rest	 of their	sentence.	Although,	they’ll	no	longer	be	alone	on	a	ship.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati’s	 next	 question	 was	 to	 be	 what	 those	 people	 did	 to	 receive	 such	 harsh conditions.	She	then	decided	she	might	not	want	to	know.	Mr.	Keebler	seemed	to wait	for	her	to	ask	that	question.	Pati	let	him	wait. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	will	not	say	that’s	a	possibility	in	your	case,	Ms.	McLear.	What	I	will	say is	if	we	go	to	trial,	the	charges	the	state	has	laid	out	can,	theoretically,	result	in	a Long-Term	Repatriation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	done	now?”	Nancy	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly.	What	would	you	like	to	add,	Ms.	Tate?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	say	it’s	your	turn	to	suggest	what	my	client	might	do	since	I’ve	already</p>
<p class="calibre1">given	a	reasonable	offer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 won’t	 get	 into	 our	 differing	 definitions	 of	 the	 term,	 ‘reasonable.’	 I’ll	 just tell	you	what	I’m	thinking,	and	that’s	a	year	working	a	municipal	ice-miner	with monthly	turnarounds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nonsense,”	Nancy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	the	ice-miner?”	Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Karakorum	 has	 small	 cargo	 ships	 dedicated	 to	 flying	 out	 to	 the	 ring	 and pulling	 in	 ice	 for	 the	 city's	 water.	 There	 are	 four	 ships,	 and	 only	 two	 have dedicated	 personnel.	 The	 other	 two	 are	 worked	 by	 citizens,	 basically	 an enhanced	community	service,	but	you’re	out	for	a	whole	month	before	you	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">return,	and	you	only	get	a	day	off	before	you’re	back	mining	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 didn’t	 say,	 “That	 sucks,”	 which	 was	 her	 first	 impression.	 Although,	 if city	workers	do	it,	how	bad	could	it	be? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	returned	her	attention	to	Mr.	Keebler.	“A	month	of	actual	community</p>
<p class="calibre1">service	and	return	to	Earth	for	ten	years.”	Nancy	pointed	her	thumb	at	Pati.	“This lady	could	own	part	of	McLear	Industries	in	the	near	future.	You	really	want	to play	hardball	with	her	now,	when	she	could	have	that	much	power?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr.	Keebler	smiled.	“I	agree,	that	might	be	the	case,	except	I’ll	probably	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">retired	before	that	happens.”	He	looked	at	Pati	and	back	to	Nancy.	“Six	months on	the	ice-mining	ship.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 turned	 to	 Pati.	 “Do	 you	 know	 when	 the	 next	 ship	 back	 to	 Earth arrives?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Two	months,	and	it’s	on	a	bi-yearly	round	trip.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gavin,	 she’ll	 do	 two	 months	 community	 service,	 with	 restrictions	 from Karakorum	 for	 three	 years.	 One	 of	 my	 associates	 or	 I	 will	 negotiate	 with	 the McLear	lawyers	on	her	behalf,	and	we	might	need	her	to	return.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	you	can	do	the	paperwork	to	get	an	exemption,”	he	said.	He	turned	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati.	“Ms.	McLear,	how	long	till	the	next	ship	back	to	Earth,	after	the	one	you</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>just	specified?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	 a	 five-year	 ship	 the	 next	 month	 which	 I’m	 not	 interested	 in.	 Four months	from	now	is	a	fast	ship	which	is	too	expensive.	It	does	get	back	to	Earth sooner	than	the	bi-yearly	ship.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,”	he	said.	He	seemed	to	think	for	a	second	and	then	shook	his	head.	“I</p>
<p class="calibre1">can’t	 believe	 I’m	 doing	 this,	 and	 there	 might	 be	 hell	 to	 pay	 for	 even	 trying, but…”	 He	 took	 a	 deep	 breath.	 “I’ll	 go	 four	 months	 on	 the	 ice-miner,	 and	 then have	Ms.	McLear	booked	on	the	fast	ship	as	an	undesirable,	which	means	she’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 basic	 accommodations	 at	 cost.	 That	 should	 bridge	 the	 differences	 in expense.”	He	stared	at	Pati	for	a	moment.	“And,	since	you’re	an	Earth-born,	we can	 make	 you	 commander	 of	 the	 ice-mining	 ship,	 which	 will	 cut	 a	 month	 off your	sentence	if	all	goes	well.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 primary	 dread	 Pati	 had	 coming	 to	 the	 state	 attorney’s	 office,	 was	 that they’d	keep	her	on	Titan	for	the	next	few	years.	In	no	way,	shape,	or	form	did she	 expect	 to	 learn	 she	 could	 be	 on	 a	 ship	 alone	 traveling	 back	 to	 Earth	 over fifteen	or	thirty	years.	Nancy’s	confidence	aside,	the	possibility	of	that	sentence made	Pati’s	heart	stop.	Her	heart	didn’t	start	again	until	he	talked	about	a	year’s work	 on	 the	 ice-miners,	 which	 was	 better	 than	 the	 worst	 case	 she’d	 imagined when	she	walked	into	the	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 shook	 her	 head	 again	 and	 rose	 from	 her	 chair.	 “You	 know,	 Gavin,	 I don’t	think	your	bosses	want	this	to	go	to	trial.	So,	I	feel	comfortable	rejecting your	offers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	believe	that,”	he	said.	“If	Ms.	McLear	walks	free,	which	is	not	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">different	 from	 your	 proposals,	 then	 they’ll	 have	 hell	 to	 pay,	 which	 will	 come down	on	me	next.	I	will	try	this	case	if	necessary.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 sorry,	 I	 just	 don’t	 see	 it,”	 Nancy	 said,	 after	 standing	 and	 listening	 to Gavin.	“Come	on,	Pati.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nancy,	wait,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	stopped	and	sat	back	down.	“Gavin,	will	you	please	excuse	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly,	how	long	should	I	wait?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Give	us	five	minutes	and	check.	I’ll	tell	you	then	if	we	need	more	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,”	he	said	and	walked	out	of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	want	to	discuss?”	Nancy	asked	after	the	door	shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	good	with	the	three	months	on	the	ice-miner,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pati,	you	don’t	know	what	working	on	those	ships	is	like.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	can’t	be	worse	than	working	on	my	father’s	fishing	boat.	It’s	probably	far easier.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	but	the	people	on	those	ice-miners	are	criminals.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Secgen	criminals,	correct.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>Nancy	paused.	“That	doesn’t	mean	they’re	not	dangerous,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Apparently,	so	am	I,	that’s	why	we’re	here,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pati,	don’t	be	flippant	about	your	situation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	you’re	right.	Just	know	I	won’t	take	a	chance	on	that	long-term	thing</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	said.	If	people	here,	who	grew	up	in	low	gravity,	can	do	a	job,	I	should	not have	 a	 problem.	 If	 you	 can	 get	 more	 from	 him,	 please	 do	 so.	 Otherwise,	 I’m good	with	the	three	months.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	took	a	deep	breath.	“Okay,	just	let	me	do	some	research	first.	I’ll	tell him	we’re	seriously	considering	his	offer	and	will	get	back	to	him	by	the	end	of the	day	with	an	answer.	He	should	be	good	with	that,	and	I’ve	never	known	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 play	 games	 when	 an	 easy	 solution	 is	 put	 in	 front	 of	 him.”	 Nancy	 stood	 up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	go	tell	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 stood	 outside	 the	 Karakorum	 Spaceport.	 She	 had	 parked	 her	 groundcar	 in the	 lot	 by	 the	 south	 train	 terminus	 and	 Nancy	 was	 to	 meet	 her	 before	 they walked	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	area	was	much	like	the	rest	of	Karakorum	that	sat	inside	a	pressure	hull</p>
<p class="calibre1">protecting	 people	 from	 the	 cold	 and	 oxygen-deficient	 Titan	 atmosphere.	 The ceiling,	 over	 a	 hundred	 meters	 above	 the	 ground,	 portrayed	 a	 daytime	 sky	 on Earth.	It	would	change	to	night	sometime	later,	following	the	position	of	a	thirty-eight-latitude	location.	Pati	was	used	to	a	higher	latitude	on	Earth,	but	she	didn’t split	hairs	over	that	inconvenience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	spaceport	exterior	used	blue	coatings	and	was	bare	of	the	windows	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw	 on	 the	 other	 administrative	 buildings	 at	 Karakorum.	 A	 notable	 exception was	 the	 judicial	 building	 that	 had	 been	 added	 on.	 The	 architect	 must	 not	 have cared	to	transition	seamlessly	between	the	two.	Cheap	construction	or	not,	what mattered	 to	 her	 was	 she	 didn’t	 have	 to	 visit	 that	 judicial	 building	 and	 face	 the possibility	of	a	Long-Term	Repatriation	sentence.	Gavin	Keebler	made	that	point as	a	negotiation	ploy,	and	Pati	had	to	admit	it	affected	her	enough	to	settle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	got	Pati	the	three-month	deal,	with	the	added	caveat	that	all	charges</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 be	 expunged	 from	 her	 record	 after	 she	 completed	 her	 sentence.	 This would	remove	any	barriers	to	negotiating	a	settlement	with	Kerry	McLear.	Also, the	 fast	 cruise	 back	 to	 Earth	 was	 available	 at	 a	 reduced	 cost,	 a	 price	 she	 could</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>pay	with	the	minimal	funds	she	had	immediately	available. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 heard	 a	 trolley	 approach	 the	 south	 terminus	 station.	 The	 red,	 two-car train	clanged	artificially	as	it	approached,	and	parked	next	to	a	platform	between the	 two	 sets	 of	 rails.	 Pati	 couldn’t	 see	 the	 people	 exit	 the	 train,	 but	 she	 saw several	people	leaving	the	platform.	Nancy	was	in	that	group	and	walked	up	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	ready	to	go?”	Nancy	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 I	 already	 sent	 them	 the	 personal	 items	 I	 want	 to	 have	 with	 me.	 The uniforms	they	sent	me	fit,	so	I	can’t	think	of	anything	else,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	let’s	go,”	Nancy	said	and	led	her	to	the	double	doors	of	the	spaceport</p>
<p class="calibre1">entrance.	 The	 doors	 slid	 open,	 and	 other	 passengers	 walked	 out	 while	 they entered.	 They	 crossed	 into	 a	 terminal,	 coated	 blue	 like	 the	 exterior.	 Maybe	 ten meters	 away	 was	 a	 line	 of	 transportation	 desks	 used	 to	 process	 passengers	 and their	baggage.	Three	workers	were	helping	about	twelve	people	cued	up	to	move</p>
<p class="calibre1">onto	their	transports. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	going	to	Picus	to	work	this	morning,”	Nancy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 nodded.	 With	 her	 private	 space	 dock	 on	 the	 McLear	 house,	 she	 never needed	 to	 come	 here	 after	 arriving	 the	 first	 time	 to	 meet	 Richard.	 She	 stopped walking.	That	had	been	a	wonderful	time	when	she	met	him	here	in	this	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	another	bad	dream	last	night.	The	guilt	and	remorse	hit	her	after	that first	 nightmare	 and	 had	 increased	 since	 then.	 Was	 it	 something	 to	 do	 with	 the legal	negotiations	that	instigated	the	remorse,	or	was	it	inevitable?	She	had	eaten little	in	the	last	few	days,	which	meant	the	feelings	were	bothering	her.	Having to	serve	on	this	ice-mining	ship	almost	felt	like	a	relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	prodded	her	to	keep	moving.	She	led	her	through	a	door	to	the	right, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which	also	slid	open	on	their	approach.	They	entered	the	massive	hangar	for	all flights	leaving	Karakorum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	been	in	covered	football	stadiums	smaller	than	this,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“View	 the	 scenery	 as	 we’re	 walking.	 I	 have	 to	 be	 back	 for	 a	 meeting	 in	 an hour.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	take	the	groundcar	back?”	Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	appreciate	you	letting	me	use	it	today.	I’ll	return	it	to	your	garage	so	you can	have	it	when	you	come	back	in	a	month.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	I	can	take	the	trolley	to	my	house,”	Pati	said.	“I’ll	have	to	get	used	to being	poor,	I	guess.”	Pati	meant	it	as	a	fact,	and	a	joke.	Nancy	kept	walking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	they	walked	through	took	them	around	passenger	processing,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">directly	 to	 the	 spacecraft.	 They	 walked	 along	 a	 designated	 pathway	 that	 led	 to the	 support	 road	 for	 the	 docks.	 The	 spacecraft	 parked	 nearest	 to	 the	 terminal were	small	landers	meant	to	travel	between	Picus	and	Titan.	Next,	she	saw	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>shuttles	 that	 traveled	 to	 the	 other	 moons	 of	 Saturn.	 Then	 they	 approached	 the mining	 ships	 like	 the	 one	 Pati	 would	 work	 from.	 Almost	 the	 size	 of	 a	 small building,	they	were	still	not	the	largest	ships	in	this	hangar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 did	 not	 plan	 on	 providing	 a	 tour,	 and	 she	 stopped	 at	 the	 first	 ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maintenance	workers	exited	through	a	person-size	hatch,	leaving	the	door	open</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind	them.	Nancy	turned	to	Pati. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	mining	ship	37-C,”	she	said.	“It’ll	be	your	home	for	the	next	three</p>
<p class="calibre1">months.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 black	 ship	 towered	 over	 them,	 and	 she	 could	 see	 at	 least	 half	 the	 ship was	below	their	feet.	She	had	reviewed	the	specs	and	knew	it	to	be	fifteen	meters in	diameter	and	thirty	meters	tall.	What	she	could	see	was	the	cylindrical	shape of	the	cargo	holds	topped	with	a	squatted	cone	holding	the	command	center:	her office	for	the	next	three	months. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	engines	were	at	the	bottom,	and	they	weren’t	huge	or	powerful.	This	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	meant	to	be	a	fast	ship.	It	picked	up	water	and	came	back	using	some	of	that water	as	a	propellant.	Robots	and	computers	did	most	of	the	work;	the	crew	was only	 necessary	 for	 maintenance	 and	 immediate	 decisions.	 Her	 research	 let	 her know	those	tasks	alone	would	keep	her,	and	her	crew,	very	busy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	ready	for	this?”	Nancy	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	better	be,”	Pati	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	that	crew	you	have.	I’ve	seen	their	records.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 have,	 too.	 They’re	 nothing	 I	 can’t	 handle.	 They’re	 not	 murderers	 or anything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	shook	her	head.	“Yeah,	but	you	have	to	admit,	Bruno	Redden	can	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">violent.	That’s	why	he’s	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	 secgen,	 and	 he’s	 not	 much	 bigger	 than	 Richard.”	 Pati	 regretted	 saying that.	If	she	could	go	back	and	do	it	all	over,	she’d	walked	out	of	the	house	after Richard	 hit	 her	 the	 first	 time	 and	 find	 a	 constable	 to	 arrest	 him.	 Or,	 she	 could have	 just	 pushed	 him	 over,	 away	 from	 the	 steel	 pillar	 so	 he	 wouldn’t	 get	 hurt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 I	 researched	 more	 about	 those	 twins.	 You’ll	 need	 to	 watch	 your	 back with	those	two.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 will.	 If	 they	 don’t	 do	 their	 jobs	 properly,	 I’ll	 report	 them,	 and	 they’ll	 be facing	a	trip	back	to	Earth	on	separate	ships.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	that’s	true,	you	have	a	big	stick	to	hold	over	their	heads	if	they	don’t act	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	everything	is	on	record.	I	am	going	to	have	to	get	used	to	undressing	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">front	of	the	cameras,	though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 smiled.	 “It	 sounds	 like	 you’ve	 prepared	 for	 this	 mission	 and	 can</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>protect	yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 haven’t	 always	 been	 the	 rich	 girl.	 I	 had	 brothers	 who	 could	 get	 very physical.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you	had	to	learn	to	get	physical	with	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	it	just	came	naturally.	Never	had	a	problem	jumping	in	and	taking	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">on.	Sometimes	I	came	out	the	worst,	most	times	I	gave	better	than	I	got.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	shrugged.	“All	right,	then.	You	need	anything	else	from	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I’ll	keep	you	updated,	though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	 do.	 I’ll	 do	 the	 same	 with	 respect	 to	 your	 case	 with	 McLear Industries.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Absolutely.	I	can	pay	you	better	after	we	settle	with	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	worry	about	getting	through	the	next	three	months,	Pati.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	I’ll	see	you	then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,	 see	 ya,”	 Nancy	 said	 and	 turned	 to	 walk	 away.	 Pati	 watched	 till	 she was	next	to	the	landers,	and	then	turned	herself	toward	the	mining	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 stepped	 through	 the	 hatch	 and	 entered	 a	 short	 hallway	 that	 led	 to	 a circular	 common	 room.	 There	 were	 personnel	 rooms	 around	 the	 circumference and	another	hatch	across	from	her.	Three	men	stood	in	front	of	that	closed	hatch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	read	their	bios	and	knew	them	on	sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	tall	one	was	Bruno	Redden.	Born	on	Karakorum,	his	family	had	been	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Titan	 almost	 from	 the	 start.	 They	 were	 drillers	 like	 Nancy’s	 parents;	 it	 was	 a good	 trade,	 and	 they	 made	 good	 money	 from	 it.	 Bruno	 was	 twenty-eight, unmarried,	 like	 most	 young	 men	 at	 Karakorum,	 and	 enjoyed	 frequenting	 the social	establishments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those	 same	 social	 establishments	 had	 been	 his	 downfall.	 He	 liked	 to	 bully people	after	having	his	drinks,	and	the	owners	didn’t	like	him	doing	that	to	their other	 customers.	 The	 conflicts	 ended	 in	 violence	 four	 times,	 and	 each	 time	 the property	 owners	 got	 a	 pound	 of	 flesh	 from	 Bruno.	 He’d	 worked	 ice-miners before	and	was	on	figurative	thin	ice	during	this	trip.	If	Pati	didn’t	endorse	his work	three	months	from	now,	he	could	face	years	of	solitude	on	the	way	back	to Earth’s	moon,	where	they	imprisoned	the	secgens	who	could	not	live	on	Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 two	 shorter	 men	 were	 Jeff	 and	 Jake	 Bocelli.	 They	 were	 both	 born	 in Karakorum,	their	parents	having	emigrated	from	the	Argentinian	region	of	South America.	 Unfortunately,	 their	 parents	 died	 when	 the	 twins	 were	 only	 ten	 years old,	and	the	state	raised	them	after	that.	The	state	wasn’t	up	to	the	challenge	of developing	 young	 men,	 and	 the	 pair	 accumulated	 a	 long	 history	 of	 minor offenses	that	led	to	major	ones	as	they	assumed	adulthood.	Unlike	Bruno,	their violent	offenses	were	subtle	and	harder	to	prove.	She	would	have	to	keep	an	eye on	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>She	 studied	 the	 trio’s	 facial	 expressions	 and	 could	 feel	 their	 disdain.	 She would	have	to	change	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 already	 know	 who	 you	 are,”	 she	 said.	 “So,	 let	 me	 introduce	 myself.	 My name	is	Pati	Lynch,	and	I	lived	all	my	life	on	Earth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	disdain	changed	to	fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a><b class="calibre2">3	The	Next	Murder</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 didn’t	 leave	 the	 bridge	 much	 during	 the	 workday.	 Or	 during	 much	 of	 the work	 night	 either.	 When	 she	 told	 Nancy	 that	 she’d	 worked	 her	 father’s	 fishing boat	as	a	kid	and	that	ice-mining	couldn’t	be	any	harder,	she	hadn’t	understood there	were	different	kinds	of	hard.	Even	though	the	ship	and	the	machinery	did most	 of	 the	 work,	 getting	 the	 humans	 to	 do	 their	 share	 was	 more	 difficult	 than talking	the	fish	into	giving	up	before	being	caught.	And,	she	never	had	to	worry about	the	fish	trying	to	kill	her	when	she	wasn’t	looking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 sat	 at	 her	 control	 station	 on	 the	 bridge.	 The	 bridge	 was	 circular	 with various	 shades	 of	 white,	 five	 meters	 in	 diameter,	 and	 with	 four	 workstations against	the	wall	spaced	ninety	degrees	from	each	other;	she	did	most	of	her	work here.	An	exit	ladder	pierced	the	center	of	the	deck	down	to	their	living	space. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	moment,	only	Bruno	and	she	were	working.	The	Bocelli	twins	were	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	cabins	sleeping	or	plotting	to	kill	her	and	take	over.	From	her	work	station, she	 could	 bring	 up	 on-screen	 what	 their	 heart	 and	 breathing	 rates	 were	 and compare	 them	 to	 their	 sleeping	 baseline.	 The	 twins	 hadn’t	 learned	 to	 mimic those	signals	to	her,	at	least	not	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	twins	were	amazingly	intelligent,	and	one	reason	she	didn’t	sleep	much, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 well,	 when	 she	 had	 the	 chance.	 This	 was	 their	 third	 time	 sentenced	 to	 ice-mining,	 and	 they	 were	 somehow	 always	 assigned	 to	 the	 same	 ship.	 Pati	 would suggest	 in	 her	 reports	 they	 be	 separated	 if	 sentenced	 again,	 though	 if	 they	 ran afoul	of	the	law	one	more	time,	they’d	probably	be	repatriated	on	separate	ships. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 monthly	 reports	 she	 filed	 were	 one	 of	 the	 few	 weapons	 she	 had.	 The crew	understood	their	sentences	could	be	extended	if	she	didn’t	rate	them	highly in	 cooperation	 and	 behavior.	 Not	 a	 fact	 she	 held	 over	 their	 heads,	 just	 yet,	 and she	hoped	she	wouldn’t	have	too,	but	useful	just	the	same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	 boss-lady,	 we	 have	 a	 load	 of	 water	 up	 ahead,”	 Bruno	 said	 to	 her from	his	workstation	across	the	bridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	stood	up	and	walked	over	to	Bruno.	On	this	ship,	she	and	the	crew	wore</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoes	that	magnetically	held	them	secured	to	the	deck.	It	wasn’t	the	same	as	one-sixth	gravity,	just	enough	to	keep	them	from	floating	around	the	ship.	The	green jumpsuit	 uniforms	 they	 wore	 also	 had	 some	 ferrous	 material	 that	 could	 be activated	and	draw	them	to	the	floor	if	they	were	floating	in	the	air	and	could	not reach	 a	 handhold.	 She	 stood	 behind	 Bruno	 and	 stared	 at	 his	 video	 screen.	 “Go ahead	and	land,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>“Engaging,”	he	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 shut	 up	 with	 the	 boss	 lady	 comments,”	 she	 said.	 “You’re	 required	 to show	 respect	 to	 the	 mission	 commander	 and	 talking	 to	 me	 like	 that	 doesn’t achieve	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	sure,	whatever	you	want.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 took	 a	 few	 steps	 back,	 watching	 Bruno	 and	 his	 screen.	 He	 tapped	 the controls,	 and	 she	 felt	 the	 gentle	 movement	 of	 the	 ship	 accelerating.	 After	 two minutes,	according	to	the	time	display	on	Bruno’s	screen,	the	ship	decelerated	to match	the	iceberg’s	position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	ahead	and	land,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	got	this,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	took	a	deep	breath.	Dealing	with	this	idiot	running	his	mouth	continued</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 test	 her	 patience.	 She’d	 have	 to	 find	 other	 ways	 of	 addressing	 his	 low-level insubordination,	because	she	didn’t	want	to	use	the	bad	report	hammer,	just	for smarting	off.	It	was	also	too	early	in	their	sentence.	If	she	threw	that	card	now,	it might	not	be	available	in	two	months. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 went	 back	 to	 her	 workstation	 and	 sat	 down.	 Her	 screen	 continued	 to show	 statistics	 about	 the	 ship	 and	 crew,	 and	 she	 changed	 it	 to	 show	 exterior cameras.	 They	 were	 still	 approaching	 the	 iceberg	 after	 deceleration,	 which seemed	odd.	“Bruno,	check	our	position,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ship	lurched	down,	and	the	effect	bounced	Pati	from	her	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	the	hell?!”	she	screamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	sensors	overestimated	the	distance	to	the	target,”	Bruno	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 rotated	 in	 the	 air	 and	 pushed	 back	 from	 the	 ceiling	 with	 her	 feet.	 The momentum	carried	her	over	to	Bruno’s	side.	She	landed	on	the	floor	next	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	could	see	he	had	his	feet	planted	while	he	sat,	which	kept	him	secured	to	the chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 do	 you	 mean,	 it	 overestimated	 the	 distance?”	 Pati	 asked.	 “Those sensors	don’t	malfunction.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	they	did	it,	I	mean,	I	gave	it	the	right	orders,	so	there	can	be	no	other explanation	for	hitting	the	ice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Check	for	damage,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 returned	 his	 attention	 to	 his	 work	 console	 and	 tapped	 the	 buttons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing,	 the	 force	 of	 impact	 was	 within	 the	 maximum	 force	 the	 landing	 legs were	designed	to	take.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	sure?”	Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bruno	nodded	his	head.	“I’ve	never	seen	the	landing	legs	break	or	cause	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">problems.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	now	you’re	saying	the	ship	doesn’t	malfunction.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>Bruno’s	face	turned	red.	She	knew	she’d	struck	a	nerve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 structure	 of	 the	 ship	 is	 different	 than	 the	 control	 coding.	 The	 control coding	is	why	we	hit	the	ice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	shook	her	head.	“I	don’t	see	it.	We	have	the	same	coding	on	this	ship	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	we	left	and	we’ve	landed	on	three	icebergs	already	without	incident.”	She looked	Bruno	square	in	the	face.	“Are	you	sure	you’re	not	the	one	who	screwed</p>
<p class="calibre1">up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bruno	stood	and	towered	over	Pati.	“I’ve	had	enough	of	you,	lady,”	he	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	swung	his	open	right	hand	at	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 expected	 that.	 She	 popped	 him	 under	 the	 ribcage	 before	 his	 slap	 could land.	It	was	a	punch	she	studied	before	taking	control	of	the	ship.	The	move	took little	 force,	 which	 was	 important	 in	 zero	 gravity,	 where	 she	 could	 not	 rely	 on having	traction	at	her	feet.	Even	better	was	it	wouldn’t	leave	a	mark.	It	had	the intended	effect	of	knocking	the	wind	out	of	his	lungs,	and	the	look	on	his	face	in that	instant	told	her	there	would	also	be	a	psychological	effect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	sat	back	and	tried	to	catch	his	breath.	“You	hit	me,”	he	gasped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bruno,	 you’ve	 been	 on	 how	 many	 of	 these	 ice-mining	 trips?	 Don’t	 you realize	we’re	being	recorded	with	every	breath	we	take?	When	we	get	back,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">constables	will	go	through	this	and	see	you	raised	your	hand	to	me,	and	I	had	to defend	 myself.	 It	 won’t	 matter	 what	 I	 report,	 because	 they	 have	 all	 the information	 they	 need	 to	 run	 you	 out	 here	 another	 month.”	 Pati	 paused	 and waited	for	what	she	said	to	get	through	his	thick	skull.	He	was	breathing	close	to normal	now,	and	for	once,	she	had	his	attention.	“Of	course,	you	can	balance	that negative	by	having	a	positive	work	record.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bruno	took	another	deep	breath,	and	his	face	reddened	again.	He	turned	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	and	focused	on	his	workstation.	“The	ship	is	ready	to	dig	for	water,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	get	it	started,”	she	said.	Pati	returned	to	her	workstation	and	switched the	screen	to	monitor	the	ice-mining.	They’d	take	in	enough	water	to	fill	one	of the	tanks,	yet	not	enough	to	disfigure	the	iceberg,	which	was	an	environmental requirement.	 Given	 that	 her	 ship	 must	 have	 looked	 like	 a	 flea	 on	 the	 side	 of	 a white	 dog,	 she	 couldn’t	 see	 the	 problem	 if	 they	 made	 ten	 trips	 here.	 However, her	 sentence	 was	 for	 three	 months	 and	 she	 would	 do	 as	 told,	 unlike	 her	 crew sometimes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>Pati	saw	the	end	of	the	monthly	tunnel	through	bloodshot	eyes.	She’d	worked	on the	 ice-mining	 ship	 for	 two	 months,	 and	 after	 this	 load,	 they’d	 return	 to Karakorum	for	a	few	days	of	leave	before	working	their	final	month.	They	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">needed	to	load	up	water	from	this	iceberg,	and	the	ship’s	tanks	would	be	full. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stood	at	her	workstation,	while	Jake	sat	at	his.	Jeff	attended	to	his	duties down	in	the	maintenance	level	and,	if	necessary,	Pati	could	turn	the	cameras	on to	watch	him	at	work	or	just	make	sure	he	wasn’t	up	to	no	good.	The	twins	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	on	their	best	behavior	of	late,	so	she	didn’t	worry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pati,”	Jake	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	having	difficulties	with	debris	on	the	landing	legs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	did	you	find	out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 checked	 the	 exterior	 cameras	 and	 told	 Jeff	 to	 go	 clear	 it	 fifteen	 minutes ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait,	you	authorized	an	excursion	without	telling	me?”	Pati	asked.	“And	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">exited	the	ship	without	a	partner?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	taking	a	robot	with	him	to	help,”	Jake	said.	“The	robot	works	in	lieu	of a	partner,	according	to	the	regulations.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	but—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	you’d	rather	us	show	some	initiative	and	get	the	job	done	without</p>
<p class="calibre1">bothering	you,”	he	said.	“You	know,	you’ve	told	us	that	several	times.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	okay,”	she	said.	“He’s	outside	already?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then,	 I’ll	 check	 on	 him.”	 Pati	 changed	 the	 display	 on	 her	 screen	 to	 the exterior	cameras.	She	could	see	Jeff	in	the	excursion	suit,	with	a	robot	about	half his	height.	She	couldn’t	see	the	debris,	though. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jeff,	this	is	Pati,	come	in,”	she	said	to	the	communicator	at	her	workstation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pati,	I’m	almost	done.	I’ll	let	you	know	when	in	a	few	minutes,”	Jeff	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got	it,”	Pati	said.	She	sat	back,	wishing	she	could	turn	in	for	the	night,	or day.	 She	 hadn’t	 bothered	 to	 check	 the	 time,	 although	 the	 twins	 usually	 worked second	shift	while	Bruno	and	she	took	the	first.	When	she	took	the	commander’s job,	she	didn’t	expect	that	as	a	commander	for	convicts	she’d	have	to	work	one shift	 and	 monitor	 the	 other.	 After	 two	 months	 of	 occupational	 insomnia,	 she would	spend	her	leave	time	sleeping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pati,	Jeff	said	he	needs	help,”	Jake	said.	“I’m	going	to	suit	up,	and—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.”	Pati	stood	up.	“I’ll	go	help	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whatever	you	say,	boss.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 had	 no	 intention	 of	 letting	 them	 work	 outside	 together	 without</p>
<p class="calibre1">supervision.	She	stepped	over	to	the	open	hatch	in	the	center	of	the	bridge	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>dove	down	into	the	common	room	using	the	ladder	to	guide	her.	She	continued down	through	another	hatch	into	the	maintenance	level.	The	maintenance	level</p>
<p class="calibre1">kept	all	the	tools	and	machinery	needed	to	keep	the	ship	running.	It	also	stored their	excursion	suits,	two	to	a	person,	in	lockers	along	the	wall.	She	floated	over to	her	locker	and	opened	the	metal	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	took	a	minute	to	slide	into	the	excursion	suit,	which	tightened	around	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">green	uniform	and	boots.	She	carried	the	helmet	to	the	hatch	and	donned	it.	She let	the	static	robot	do	checks	on	her	suit	functions	and,	after	a	green	light	from the	robot,	she	stepped	into	the	airlock.	The	windowed	door	slid	shut	behind	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 waited	 a	 few	 seconds	 for	 the	 air	 to	 evacuate	 and	 then	 another	 green	 light told	 her	 she	 was	 ready	 to	 exit.	 She	 touched	 the	 button	 under	 the	 lights	 to	 open the	exterior	hatch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	attached	her	line	to	a	connecting	point	next	to	the	door	and	descended	to the	 iceberg	 surface.	 She	 turned	 on	 her	 light	 to	 study	 minor	 indentations	 in	 the snowy	 surface,	 places	 where	 a	 human	 and	 robot	 might	 have	 traveled.	 But	 she saw	no	Jeff	and	no	robot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jeff,	where	did	you	go?”	she	said	into	her	helmet	communicator.	The	door</p>
<p class="calibre1">shut	behind	her	once	she	was	clear.	Pati	floated	around	the	landing	legs,	which fastened	 the	 ship	 to	 the	 iceberg.	 She	 connected	 her	 line	 to	 hooks	 in	 the	 legs	 to keep	 from	 floating	 too	 far	 away.	 While	 looking	 for	 Jeff,	 she	 looked	 for	 any debris	that	might	have	been	removed.	She	found	none,	nor	any	sign	that	debris</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	been	attached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jake,	 you	 there?”	 she	 asked.	 She	 waited	 for	 a	 response	 and	 got	 nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jake,	come	in.”	Still	no	response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 didn’t	 wait.	 She	 returned	 to	 the	 hatch,	 collecting	 her	 line	 as	 she	 went, and	pulled	herself	back	to	the	top	step	by	the	door.	The	red	light	to	the	left	was on,	showing	an	airlock	full	of	air.	Before	she	could	tap	the	manual	entry	button underneath,	she	felt	the	ship	lurch	upward,	ready	to	launch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 excursion	 suits	 had	 means	 for	 separating	 waste	 from	 the	 human</p>
<p class="calibre1">occupant.	Sometimes	though,	the	crew	would	not	bother	to	disrobe	and	exit	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ship	 for	 a	 short	 while,	 expecting	 to	 be	 back	 in	 the	 ship	 before	 any	 such emergencies	would	arise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ship’s	movement,	with	her	on	the	outside	where	she	might	be	left	to	die</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	iceberg,	caused	her	to	lose	her	bladder.	She	gripped	her	line’s	connection point	and	held	on,	hoping	to	go	with	the	ship	at	least.	After	a	few	minutes	of	no movement,	she	realized	the	ship	wasn’t	leaving,	and	she	reached	over	and	tapped the	 code	 to	 open	 the	 hatch.	 She	 watched	 three	 minutes	 tick	 off	 on	 her	 helmet display,	 the	 time	 it	 took	 for	 the	 airlock	 to	 depressurize	 to	 a	 vacuum:	 it	 seemed like	thirty	minutes.	The	hatch	opened	on	schedule,	and	she	pulled	herself	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>Pati	 lost	 no	 time	 activating	 the	 controls	 to	 shut	 the	 hatch	 behind	 her, pressurize	the	airlock,	and	get	back	into	the	ship.	The	maintenance	level	was	as empty	as	when	she	came	through,	so	she	doffed	the	excursion	suit	and	removed</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	jumper	to	see	the	damage.	The	stain	was	bad	enough	to	return	to	her	cabin</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	change,	which	she	then	did	in	her	underclothes,	expecting	Jeff	and	Jake	to be	 there	 waiting	 to	 enjoy	 the	 pain	 their	 joke	 had	 caused	 her.	 For	 their	 sake, they’d	better	be	somewhere	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	took	her	a	minute	to	change	her	underclothes	and	into	an	identical	jumper, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 a	 few	 minutes	 after	 that	 to	 quietly	 return	 to	 the	 bridge.	 She	 held	 onto	 the ladder,	looking	at	the	back	of	Jake,	who	seemed	not	to	notice	she’d	returned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	actions,	or	lack	of,	were	as	big	a	lie	as	if	he’d	sworn	he	had	nothing	to	do with	 the	 ship	 almost	 launching.	 He	 monitored	 the	 cameras	 that	 recorded everything	 on	 the	 ship,	 and	 the	 movement	 of	 the	 ship	 could	 only	 be	 initiated from	the	bridge.	He	would	know	when	the	airlock	was	activated,	and	when	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">hatches	 were	 opened	 and	 shut.	 He	 could	 even	 see	 her	 change	 clothes	 if	 he wanted,	a	fact	she	long	learned	to	live	with. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’d	 get	 her	 chance,	 though.	 Maybe	 not	 in	 a	 report,	 and	 maybe	 not	 in	 a physical	manner.	They’d	pay	for	this,	both	of	them,	before	their	time	was	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Last	trip,”	Pati	said	under	her	breath.	She	and	Bruno	had	just	pulled	in	a	load	of water,	and	the	tanks	were	over	half	full.	They’d	identified	three	more	icebergs	to land	on,	and	after	that,	they’d	have	a	full	load.	Those	icebergs	were	on	the	way back	to	Karakorum,	back	to	freedom,	and	then	back	to	Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 looked	 up	 from	 her	 console	 and	 over	 to	 Bruno.	 He’d	 learned	 about controlling	 his	 temper	 in	 the	 last	 three	 months,	 at	 least	 he	 did	 when	 Pati	 was around.	Whether	he’d	be	a	better	citizen	as	a	result	wasn’t	her	problem.	He	did what	he	was	told,	most	of	the	time,	and	that	was	enough	for	Pati	to	endorse	his parole	 when	 they	 returned.	 Bruno	 would	 not	 thank	 her	 for	 it,	 but	 she	 didn’t expect	him	to	either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 returned	 her	 attention	 to	 the	 parameters	 displayed	 on	 her	 screen.	 The twins	 were	 resting	 in	 their	 rooms,	 or	 at	 least	 their	 heartbeats	 and	 respiration matched	the	usual	readings	when	they	slept.	Pati	learned	never	to	trust	anything about	those	two	she	didn’t	see	with	her	own	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>Doing	 so	 caused	 her	 to	 grow	 a	 few	 levels	 in	 resourcefulness	 and	 ingenuity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	deadly	tricks	they	played	forced	that	growth,	and	that	growth	wouldn’t	have happened	to	Pati	McLear	living	the	good	life	on	Karakorum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	combat	their	tricks,	at	the	end	of	the	second	month,	she	stored	evidence	at Karakorum.	 Evidence	 that	 normally	 disappeared	 after	 one	 of	 her	 near-fatal accidents.	Before	the	last	trip	out,	she	showed	them	how	that	evidence	would	be sent	 straight	 to	 the	 constables	 should	 another	 unfortunate	 event	 happen	 to	 her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	got	the	message	and	had	a	newfound	concern	for	her	wellbeing	since	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">accidents,	even	if	they	weren’t	the	cause,	would	send	them	on	a	long	trip	back	to Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Damn!”	Bruno	yelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pat	swung	around.	“What	is	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our	life	support	systems	just	went	offline.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Offline,	you	mean	an	electrical	issue?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 mean	 we’re	 not	 getting	 power	 to	 the	 machinery	 that	 makes	 our	 air	 and heat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	sure	it’s	not	a	sensor	malfunction?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	the	sensors	showing	the	problem.	It’s	the	electrical	current	going	to life	support.	It’s	gone	down	to	zero.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Initiate	emergency-retrograde	procedures	to	Titan,”	she	ordered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	twelve	hours	out	and	only	have	a	partial	load	of	water,”	Bruno	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	if	we	run	out	of	air,	we	won’t	be	getting	a	full	load,	either.	Do	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Engaging,”	Bruno	said.	She	felt	a	moment	of	acceleration	toward	the	floor, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 that	 was	 it.	 There	 would	 be	 no	 rocketing	 directly	 back	 to	 Titan	 in	 this emergency.	 The	 best	 they	 could	 accomplish	 was	 to	 change	 their	 orbit	 around Saturn	 to	 get	 there	 sooner.	 It	 should	 buy	 them	 enough	 time	 to	 come	 up	 with	 a plan	to	stay	alive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wake	up	Jeff	and	Jake,”	Pat	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bruno	 used	 his	 left	 hand	 to	 tap	 an	 on-screen	 button.	 “They’re	 on	 the maintenance	floor,	looking	into	the	problem.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	they	were	in	their	cabin,	sleeping.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Once	things	started	going	south	with	life-support,	I	hit	the	alert	button.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	my	call,	Bruno,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	turning	to	face	her,	Bruno	looked	up	from	his	console	and	shrugged</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	shoulders.	“Pati,	I	don’t	have	time	to	wait	for	orders	during	an	emergency.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 clenched	 her	 fists.	 She	 took	 a	 step	 to	 punch	 him	 in	 the	 head	 for insubordination,	 and	 then	 she	 stopped.	 This	 was	 an	 emergency;	 if	 she	 clocked him	again,	he’d	go	downstairs	to	his	cabin	and	sulk	for	a	few	days.	To	re-power the	life	support	system,	she	might	need	his	expert	electrical	skills,	so	she	had	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>have	 him	 working.	 “Fine,	 Bruno,”	 she	 said.	 “In	 the	 future,	 notify	 me immediately.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bruno	didn’t	reply.	He	lowered	his	head	and	resumed	tapping	buttons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	returned	to	her	chair	and	activated	the	command	console.	She	calculated</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 without	 power	 to	 the	 life-support	 systems,	 they	 would	 survive	 for	 eight more	 hours	 in	 the	 air	 already	 generated.	 That	 would	 be	 plenty	 of	 time	 to	 rig	 a secondary	 source	 of	 power	 to	 hold	 them	 for	 the	 return	 trip	 to	 Titan.	 The	 twins knew	 the	 danger	 and	 would	 work	 toward	 that	 end.	 	 Of	 course,	 they	 wouldn’t save	the	whole	crew	if	they	didn’t	have	to.	She	activated	her	intercom,	“Jeff	and Jake,	I	need	a	status	report.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	strange,	Pati,”	one	of	the	two	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	wrong	down	there,	Jake?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	 trying	 to	 find	 out	 why	 life-support	 power	 is	 blocked.	 It’s	 crazy because	 each	 node	 in	 the	 conduit	 between	 life-support	 and	 the	 engine	 shows	 a full	power	flux.	It’s	like	the	life-support	systems	won’t	accept	the	power.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	want	me	to	send	Bruno	down?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’ll	only	get	confused,”	Jeff	said,	and	she	turned	for	a	moment	to	look	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 back	 of	 Bruno.	 His	 neck	 phased	 into	 a	 pinkish-red,	 so	 he	 heard	 the	 insult. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jeff	was	right,	though.	If	the	problem	called	for	an	unusual	solution	or	seemed intractable,	Bruno	wasn’t	your	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Any	other	ideas?”	Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	more	than	one	way	to	skin	a	cat,”	Jeff	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	 I’m	 sure	 you	 two	 had	 plenty	 of	 practice	 at	 growing	 up,”	 Pati	 said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	heard	the	false	moans	of	insult,	then	added,	“Don’t	use	all	of	your	tricks	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Try	for	another	fifteen	minutes,	then	get	your	asses	up	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	few	seconds,	Jeff	said,	“Acknowledged.”	Her	screen	went	dark,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	 an	 unusual	 flash	 lit	 it	 back	 up.	 She	 realized	 it	 was	 a	 reflection,	 and	 she turned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	most	beautiful	vision	she’d	experienced	since	leaving	Earth.	Like</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	flame	one	meter	high,	it	glowed	next	to	the	ladder.	The	yellow	reminded	her	of a	sun	she	no	longer	experienced.	Then	she	heard	that	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	 Pati,”	 the	 apparition	 said.	 If	 the	 vision	 was	 unmitigated	 beauty,	 the voice	was	dredged	from	the	bowels	of	Pluto. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Richard,	 you’re	 supposed	 to	 be	 dead,”	 she	 said.	 Pati	 didn’t	 believe	 in ghosts,	 so	 she	 decided	 it	 could	 be	 a	 trick	 from	 her	 crew.	 She	 looked	 at	 Bruno, obviously	scared	out	of	what	little	wits	he	possessed,	so	he	wasn’t	in	on	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 you	 killed	 Richard,”	 the	 apparition	 said.	 “Except	 Richard	 agreed	 to become	 my	 host,	 and	 while	 you	 ended	 his	 existence,	 the	 people	 of	 my	 species are	not	so	easy	to	kill.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>Pati	didn’t	respond.	What	could	she	say	to	this—thing?	She	stared	until	the apparition	 continued	 the	 conversation.	 “You	 see,	 Pati,	 my	 people	 are	 the predominant	 species	 on	 Titan,	 and	 although	 we	 are	 happy	 to	 have	 you	 visitors from	Earth,	we	need	to	have	you	here	on	our	terms.	I	was	working	toward	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">end	when	you	eliminated	Richard,	and	I	must	admit,	I	take	offense	at	disruptions in	my	plans.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	want?”	Pati	spat	out.	The	terse	reply	came	out	so	easy	to	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 I’m	 sure	 you’re	 familiar	 with	 the	 phrase,	 ‘to	 err	 is	 human,	 forgive divine.’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	what	of	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 those	 of	 my	 species	 know	 little	 about	 your	 divinities.	 What	 phrases we	have	are	closer	to	‘an	eye	for	an	eye.’		So,	I’m	blocking	the	energy	to	your life-support	systems.	Even	though	I	harbor	no	hate	towards	you,	I’ve	decided	I must	kill	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 about	 my	 crew,	 are	 you	 going	 to	 kill	 them,	 too?”	 She	 didn’t	 lie	 to herself	that	she	cared	about	her	crew;	it	was	the	only	straw	she	had	to	grab. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	is	regrettable,	I	agree.	I	had	no	other	opportunity	to	eliminate	you	before you	returned	to	Titan,	though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	didn’t	you	do	this	on	our	first	mining	trip	to	the	rings?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 had	 to	 let	 the	 humans	 punish	 you	 for	 killing	 Richard.	 Hopefully,	 you’ve learned	your	lesson,	and	have	been	rehabilitated,	even	if	it	doesn’t	matter	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	glowing	object	faded	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Damn	 him, </i>	 she	 thought.	 Until	 thirty	 seconds	 ago,	 she	 had	 no	 belief	 in extraterrestrials;	 except	 the	 apparition	 was	 definitely	 the	 man	 she	 killed	 four months	ago.	Even	if	the	voice	was	mimicked,	the	personality	left	her	no	doubt	it was	her	ex-husband.	The	stupid	joke	about	“to	err	is	human”	was	too	much	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	 worse,	 as	 a	 human,	 Richard	 was	 very	 competent.	 If	 he	 said	 he’d accomplish	a	task,	she	knew	he’d	run	through	a	wall	to	get	it	done.	If	this,	thing, had	any	of	Richard	in	it,	she	didn’t	like	her	chances	of	getting	their	life	support running	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	again,	he	didn’t	always	succeed.	There	were	multiple	means	available</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 technically	 proficient	 to	 generate	 air	 on	 the	 ship.	 Even	 if	 Pati	 was	 no mechanical	 genius,	 Bruno	 and	 the	 twins	 could	 do	 magic	 when	 properly</p>
<p class="calibre1">motivated.	Living	to	see	another	day	should	be	sufficient	motivation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bitch!”	 Bruno	 screamed	 as	 he	 tackled	 her	 from	 behind.	 Before	 she	 could react,	 he	 wrapped	 his	 left	 arm	 around	 her	 neck	 and	 punched	 her	 in	 the	 head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 got	 us	 all	 killed,	 you	 bitch,”	 Bruno	 said.	 He	 hit	 her	 in	 the	 head	 again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>“Except	 the	 ghost	 won’t	 kill	 you.	 I’ll	 kill	 you	 first.”	 His	 left	 forearm	 locked around	 her	 throat	 and	 pulled	 with	 more	 than	 adequate	 strength	 to	 close	 her windpipe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 dug	 fingernails	 into	 his	 forearm	 and	 pulled,	 but	 his	 leverage	 was	 too much.	She	gasped	for	breath	and	mentally	grasped	for	straws.	Even	if	she	threw Bruno	off	her,	would	he	follow	her	orders	to	save	his	own	life? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	reached	behind	with	her	right	hand,	feeling	for	his	crotch.	He’d	pinned</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	body	against	hers	while	leveraging	the	chokehold,	so	she	couldn’t	quite	reach his	soft	spot.	Instead,	she	grabbed	the	inside	of	his	thigh,	right	above	the	knee, and	pinched	hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aaaah!”	 he	 screamed.	 “I’m	 going	 to	 kill	 you!”	 He	 reared	 his	 right	 hand back	 to	 punch	 her	 in	 the	 head,	 and	 Pati	 felt	 his	 left	 forearm	 loosen.	 Instead	 of digging	fingernails	into	it,	she	grabbed	his	left	hand,	twisting	it	forward	to	break the	wrist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bruno	fell	over	her	left	shoulder	to	prevent	his	wrist	from	breaking.	He	tried to	grab	her	hair	as	she	twisted	and	then	let	go	altogether	to	keep	his	wrist	in	one piece.	 Pati	 struggled	 to	 get	 away.	 When	 Bruno	 tried	 to	 keep	 up	 with	 her,	 she kicked	him	in	the	nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	bounced	up	with	only	her	shoes	holding	her	to	the	floor.	Bruno	got	up, </p>
<p class="calibre1">rubbing	his	nose.	Red-faced	again,	he	bore	down	to	attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	had	to	force	him	to	stop	so	she	could	work	on	the	life	support	and	knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	 one	 trick	 to	 disable	 him	 fully.	 When	 he	 tried	 to	 tackle	 her	 from	 the	 front, she	knuckled	her	middle	finger	and	punched	him	in	the	Adam’s	apple.	The	blow</p>
<p class="calibre1">stopped	him	cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stood	there,	grabbing	his	throat,	trying	to	suck	a	breath.	Where	he	turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">red	before,	he	now	phased	into	purple.	His	body	shook,	and	his	eyes	grew	large as	he	struggled.	Finally,	he	stopped	moving	and	floated,	attached	to	the	floor	by his	shoes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 checked	 the	 pulse	 in	 his	 neck.	 It	 confirmed	 that	 she’d	 killed	 another person	 in	 her	 twenty-four	 years	 of	 life.	 Unlike	 Richard,	 she	 felt	 remorse	 even though	Bruno	had	tried	to	kill	her.	He	was	just	an	idiot	who	didn’t	know	better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	turned	to	the	ladder	and	saw	two	weasel	faces	above	the	opening.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediately	 slipped	 down	 to	 the	 next	 level,	 closing	 the	 hatch	 tight	 around	 the ladder.	 Pati	 jumped	 over	 to	 the	 ladder	 and	 pushed	 down	 on	 the	 hatch	 with	 her foot.	The	hatch	would	normally	open	with	the	application	of	a	slight	downward</p>
<p class="calibre1">force,	but	they	had	locked	it	shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	bound	and	she	was	back	at	her	command	station.	She	pulled	a	two-</p>
<p class="calibre1">inch	 metal	 key	 from	 her	 left-sleeve	 pocket	 and	 inserted	 it	 in	 a	 slot	 next	 to	 her console	 keyboard.	 The	 command	 menu	 displayed	 on-screen,	 a	 menu	 the	 crew</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>didn’t	know	about.		She	touched	the	on-screen	button	for	crew	dispositions;	Jake and	Jeff	were	in	the	common	area	below,	working	from	the	console	down	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 had	 just	 cut	 the	 bridge	 off	 from	 what	 life-support	 functions	 they	 could access	 and	 rerouted	 the	 air	 to	 the	 common	 area.	 Lights	 on	 the	 bridge	 dimmed before	she	could	reverse	their	work.	She	re-energized	the	lights	and	opened	the intercom.	“Jake	and	Jeff,	Bruno	attacked	me.	I	had	to	disable	him.	Now	we’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">got	to	work	together	or	we	won’t	get	back	to	Titan	alive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 waited	 for	 an	 answer.	 When	 one	 didn’t	 come,	 she	 said,	 “Look,	 we	 can make	it	if	we	work	together.		If	we	fight	it	out,	we’ll	be	writing	our	own	death certificates.”	 She	 hoped	 they’d	 see	 the	 logic,	 but	 if	 they	 didn’t	 respond,	 she’d have	no	choice	but	to	cut	them	off	from	life-support.	She’d	give	them	sixty	more seconds	to	reply;	after	thirty-five,	her	screen	went	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jake	or	Jeff	had	cut	the	communication	link	from	her	command	station	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ship,	 and	 the	 lights	 dimmed	 again.	 Pati	 jumped	 over	 to	 Bruno’s	 console	 and logged	 on	 as	 the	 ship’s	 commander.	 She	 had	 priority	 access	 once	 again	 and reestablished	her	life-support.	This	time	it	only	took	them	a	few	seconds	to	cut off	Bruno’s	console	from	the	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	stood	up	and	floated	over	to	the	ladder	before	everything	went	dark.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">climbed	 and	 activated	 an	 emergency	 light	 separated	 from	 the	 ship’s	 nervous system.	The	ladder	and	hatchway	were	well	illuminated,	while	the	periphery	was dark.	She	climbed	down	and	sat	on	the	hatch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	 option	 stuck	 in	 her	 mind.	 It	 might	 save	 her	 life;	 it	 might	 also	 kill	 her sooner.	 This	 option	 would	 kill	 Jeff	 and	 Jake,	 and	 yet,	 if	 she	 did	 nothing,	 she’d die	as	they	rerouted	life-support	from	the	bridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	stood	up	and	walked	to	her	console.	She	pulled	the	command	key	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	board	and	used	it	to	open	a	small	door	underneath,	just	large	enough	to	reach into.	She	slid	her	hand	into	the	door	and	pulled	a	lever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	the	commander’s	last	resort.	If	there	was	a	mutiny,	he	or	she	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">barricade	themselves	here.	Then,	once	activated,	all	hatches	would	open	below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	mutineers	would	not	survive,	and	all	life-support	would	automatically	shift to	the	bridge.	At	least	any	life-support	functions	that	were	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	sounded	like	a	weak	toilet	flush	back	on	Earth.	Air,	water,	and	maybe	Jeff</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 Jake	 were	 rushing	 out	 the	 hatchways	 below	 the	 bridge.	 In	 the	 next	 few minutes,	 every	 compartment	 below	 her	 feet	 would	 be	 a	 vacuum	 like	 the	 space they	traveled	through.	Jake	and	Jeff	would	be	dead	whether	or	not	they	remained onboard.	Funny	thing	was,	all	the	water	and	air	leaving	the	ship	would	add	to	the ship’s	speed.	Would	it	be	enough?	Would	it	even	be	necessary?	She	would	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	less	than	twelve	hours	or	never	at	all.	The	air	thinned,	causing	her	to	become drowsy.	Pati	floated	back	to	the	hatch	and	laid	down,	facing	away	from	Bruno’s</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>body.	 Was	 this	 her	 last	 moment	 of	 life?	 She	 didn’t	 think	 more	 about	 it	 as	 the thinning	air	caused	her	to	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 Pati	 awoke,	 Nancy	 Tate	 stood	 over	 her	 hospital	 bed.	 “What	 happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	moaned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	your	ship	went	to	emergency	operations,	the	beacon	attracted	a	local</p>
<p class="calibre1">freighter.	They	arrived	two	hours	later	to	find	you	next	to	dead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	crew,	they	tried	to—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 ship’s	 memory	 was	 erased.	 The	 prosecutor	 thinks	 you	 did	 it	 to	 cover the	murder	of	your	crew.	I	told	him	to	show	me	his	evidence,	and	as	of	now,	he’s not	responded.	Do	you	remember	what	happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,	 because	 without	 the	 ship’s	 memory,	 we	 only	 need	 your	 account	 of what	happened.	Since	your	command	console	link	was	cut,	that’s	good	evidence</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	a	mutiny,	and	we’re	on	solid	ground.	You	just	need	to	finish	the	last	days	of your	sentence.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	to	go	back?”	Pati	felt	so	weak;	tears	flowed	down	her	cheeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	 worry,	 Pati,”	 Nancy	 said.	 She	 reached	 down	 and	 gave	 her	 an	 easy hug.	 “I’ve	 taken	 care	 of	 it.	 You’re	 almost	 done,	 and	 you	 can	 go	 out	 with	 a regular	mining	ship,	not	a	prison	ship.	You	won’t	be	in	command,	so	you’ll	have far	less	responsibility.”	Nancy	released	Pati	and	turned	to	look	at	the	door.	“After this	last	water-mining	trip,	you	can	return	to	Earth,	and	Richard	will	never	bother you	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	her	weakness,	Pati	gradually	sat	up.	“You	told	me	the	ship’s	memory</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	erased.	How	did	you	know	about	Richard?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	didn’t	move.	She	stared	at	the	door	for	a	few	seconds	and	then	turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">—slowly.	 She	 faced	 Pati	 again.	 “I	 meant	 his	 memory	 would	 never	 bother	 you again.”	Nancy	smiled,	and	despite	months	of	seeing	her	attorney	during	the	trial, it	was	a	smile	Pati	had	never	seen	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a><b class="calibre2">4	Deal	or	No	Deal</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Assholes,”	Pati	said.	Robots	were	in	charge	of	this	jail,	and	they	rolled	around politely,	telling	her	what	to	do.	One	took	her	breakfast	tray,	and	then	it	thanked her	as	if	it	was	serving	her	a	royal	meal.	The	kind	demeanor	was	another	form	of cruel	and	unusual	punishment	the	robots	inflicted	on	Pati	while	she	inhabited	the white,	four-by-four-meter	cell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stepped	from	the	door	and	sat	down	on	the	bed,	which	the	bastards	even</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	 for	 her.	 She’d	 been	 stuck	 in	 this	 cell	 since	 yesterday	 when	 the	 doctor released	her	from	the	hospital.	It	wasn’t	five	minutes	later	that	the	constables	had her	cuffed	and	walking	through	the	hallways	of	Karakorum.	The	people	pointed</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	stared,	wondering	what	Pati	had	done	now.	Maybe	they	all	knew.	Pati	had	no idea	because	the	only	people	she’d	talked	to	were	doctors,	nurses,	and	Nancy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	got	a	message	to	her	through	the	robots	that	she	would	meet	her	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning.	 She	 apologized	 for	 the	 incarceration	 but	 said	 the	 prosecutor	 had ordered	 it	 without	 telling	 her	 first.	 Then,	 conveniently,	 the	 notification	 arrived after	business	hours	and	Nancy	hadn’t	checked	her	account	in	that	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	 Pati	 waited.	 She	 did	 not	 know	 what	 time	 it	 was,	 only	 that	 they’d	 just served	 her	 breakfast.	 She’d	 been	 able	 to	 clean	 up	 right	 before	 leaving	 the hospital,	 and	 she	 hoped	 she’d	 be	 released	 before	 she’d	 have	 to	 use	 that disgusting	toilet	against	the	far	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 thought	 must	 have	 had	 a	 telekinetic	 effect	 because	 her	 jail	 cell	 door opened.	 She	 watched	 as	 it	 mechanically	 slid	 to	 the	 right,	 exposing	 an	 actual person	standing	behind	the	expanding	crack.	In	a	second,	she	saw	it	was	Nancy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tate,	wearing	her	blue	business	suit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	immediately	thought	of	how	much	younger	she	looked,	closer	to	Pati’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">age	 than	 the	 thirty-five	 she	 knew	 her	 to	 be,	 a	 massive	 advantage	 to	 being	 born and	raised	in	one-sixth	gravity.	An	advantage	Pati	would	willingly	give	up	just	to get	back	to	Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 had	 her	 blonde	 hair	 tied	 back,	 and	 her	 blue	 eyes	 were	 highlighted against	all	the	white.	She	stepped	through	as	soon	as	she	had	enough	door	width. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pati,	I’m	so	sorry	all	this	happened,”	she	said,	as	she	strode	over	to	Pati. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	stood	up,	“Okay,	then	tell	me	what	happened,	and	why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 looked	 around,	 and	 then	 back	 to	 Pati,	 “The	 prosecutor	 decided</p>
<p class="calibre1">yesterday	to	renege	on	the	deal	for	what	happened	on	your	ship.	He	wants	to	try the	case	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>“Can	he	do	that?”	Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 only	 had	 a	 verbal	 agreement,	 and	 this	 is	 the	 first	 time	 I’ve	 had	 them renege	on	one.	But	yes,	legally,	prosecutors	can	do	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	come?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.	I	only	know	he	wanted	to	meet	this	morning,	which	surprised</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	because	this	is	Saturday	and	most	of	the	prosecutors	disappear	until	Monday. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway,	I	want	you	to	come	with	me	because	I’ll	need	you	to	hear	everything</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	says.	The	meeting	is	in	a	half-hour.	Can	you	be	ready?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“First,	tell	me	what	time	it	is,	and	then	define	ready,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 8	 a.m.	 standard	 right	 now.”	 She	 sized	 up	 Pati’s	 appearance.	 “I	 think you’ll	 be	 okay.”	 She	 looked	 around	 the	 cell.	 “And	 I	 see	 they	 didn’t	 give	 you equipment	 to	 fix	 your	 appearance.”	 Nancy	 pulled	 the	 satchel	 from	 behind	 her back	and	placed	it	on	Pati’s	bed.	She	pulled	out	a	brush	and	mirror	and	sat	them next	 to	 the	 satchel.	 “Were	 you	 at	 least	 able	 to	 brush	 your	 teeth?”	 she	 asked, pointing	to	the	sink	next	to	the	toilet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	robots	brought	me	in	a	toothbrush	and	paste.	They	took	it	back	when	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">finished.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	good.	Take	the	brush	and	mirror	and	pull	your	hair	back.	I’ll	find	a	tie for	 you	 in	 my	 bag.”	 Nancy	 scanned	 the	 clothes	 Pati	 wore,	 which	 were	 clean versions	 of	 a	 mining	 ship	 uniform.	 “Your	 clothes	 will	 be	 okay.	 The	 meeting room	is	just	down	the	hall.	After	the	meeting,	we’ll	see	about	different	clothes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	stopped	brushing	her	hair.	“I’m	getting	out?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe,	we’ll	have	to	see.	You’re	still	technically	serving	your	first	sentence since	 your	 mining	 crew	 would	 not	 be	 released	 till	 the	 day	 after	 tomorrow.	 I’m pretty	 pissed	 at	 the	 prosecutor	 for	 throwing	 you	 in	 here	 last	 night,	 it	 was totally	unnecessary.”	Nancy	frowned	and	shook	her	head,	“He	didn’t	break	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">laws	in	doing	so,	though.”	Nancy	reached	into	her	pack	and	pulled	out	a	rubber piece	for	tying	hair	back.	She	handed	it	to	Pati	and	waited	for	her	to	secure	her dark	hair.	“You	ready?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“After	you,”	Pati	said.	The	door	remained	open	after	Nancy	entered,	and	Pati</p>
<p class="calibre1">followed	her	out	of	the	opening	into	the	metallic	hallway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	hallway	had	whiter	cell	doors	on	each	side.	Pati	counted	nine,	probably</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough	 for	 a	 boring	 place	 with	 only	 twenty-five	 thousand	 people	 like Karakorum.	 They	 hit	 a	 T-intersection	 as	 a	 waist-high	 robot	 rolled	 past.	 Nancy turned	 left	 into	 a	 hallway	 that	 was	 still	 metal	 but	 had	 faux	 wood	 trim	 and windows	 into	 the	 offices.	 Constables	 wearing	 red	 uniforms	 came	 around	 the corner	down	the	hall.	They	walked	past	Nancy	and	Pati,	not	paying	attention	and discussing	a	case	Pati	couldn't	care	less	about.	She	followed	Nancy	around	that corner	 into	 an	 open	 area	 with	 more	 constables.	 They	 sat	 at	 their	 desks,	 either</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>working	with	the	screens	attached	or	in	discussion	with	other	officers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 ignored	 all	 of	 it	 and	 entered	 an	 open	 door	 straight	 ahead	 of	 them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside	was	a	conference	table	with	eight	yellow	chairs	around	it.	Nancy	took	the head	chair	near	the	door	and	invited	Pati	to	sit	on	her	right,	which	she	did.	Then Nancy	 moved	 to	 the	 door,	 shut	 it,	 and	 returned	 to	 the	 table.	 There	 were	 no windows	in	this	room,	and	the	walls	were	as	white	as	her	jail	cell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	pulled	a	tablet	from	her	bag	and	sat	it	on	the	table.	She	tapped	it	a	few times	and	was	reviewing	the	display	when	the	door	opened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	walked	a	man	of	African	descent.	He	had	short	hair,	was	about	thirty	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	looks,	and	carried	a	tablet	like	Nancy’s.	Despite	it	being	Saturday	morning, he	was	professionally	dressed	in	a	gray	suit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 had	 seen	 his	 pic	 during	 her	 last	 trial.	 But	 this	 was	 the	 first	 time	 she’d shared	a	room	with	the	man,	and	she	couldn’t	help	it:	she	was	in	love. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nancy,”	he	said	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jack,”	she	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	focused	on	Pati.	“Ms.	Lynch,	I’m	Jack	Reagan,	the	prosecuting	attorney</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	your	case.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	nodded	in	return.	She	noted	how	he	used	her	parents’	name,	and	not	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">married	 name.	 She	 took	 her	 own	 name	 back	 before	 embarking	 on	 her	 three-month	 ice-mining	 sentence.	 Still,	 after	 two	 years	 of	 marriage,	 it	 didn’t	 seem normal	to	be	called	“Pati	Lynch”	once	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	Reagan	took	the	chair	across	from	Pati	and	seemed	in	no	way	put	off	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	having	the	head	chair.	He	put	the	tablet	he	carried	on	the	table	and	tapped it	a	few	times.	He	reviewed	the	results	and	looked	at	Nancy.	“All	right,”	he	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	get	to	the	point.	One	of	the	double-E’s	told	me	he	can	restore	the	mission records	 for	 the	 Ice-Miner	 37-charlie.	 There’s	 a	 good	 chance	 we	 can	 establish	 a hard	record	of	all	that	happened	during	the	unfortunate	event.	Then,	we’ll	know the	details	that	Ms.	Lynch	doesn’t	seem	to	recall.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 provided	 her	 statement	 after	 the	 doctors	 revived	 her.	 Absolutely,	 we’d be	interested	in	what	the	engineers	can	find	out.	We	can	discuss	the	admissibility of	that	evidence	if	and	when	it’s	discovered.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 gave	 Nancy	 an	 icy	 stare.	 “My	 settlement	 offers	 will	 be	 based	 on	 those findings,”	 he	 said.	 He	 focused	 on	 Pati	 again,	 without	 warming	 his	 glare.	 “I’ve read	 your	 account,	 Ms.	 Lynch.	 And	 I	 can	 only	 say	 it’s	 very…	 vague.	 Do	 you think	you	can	add	any	details?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pati,	don’t	answer	that	question,”	Nancy	interrupted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	had	no	intention	of	answering	that	question.	She	liked	this	Jack	Reagan</p>
<p class="calibre1">less	and	less. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	returned	her	attention	to	Jack	Reagan.	“I	had	hoped	to	get	a	detailed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>account	from	my	client	after	she	was	released	from	the	hospital.	Unfortunately, she	was	thrown	into	a	jail	cell	after	her	release.	And	now,	I	have	a	prosecuting attorney	 throwing	 questions	 at	 her	 before	 I’ve	 had	 a	 chance	 to	 reinforce	 her knowledge	of	her	rights.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ms.	 Lynch	 will	 likely	 be	 charged	 with	 murder.	 She	 previously	 pleaded	 to the	 crime	 of	 human-slaughter	 and	 is	 still	 serving	 her	 sentence.	 I	 have	 a responsibility	to	the	people	of	Karakorum,	and	that	means	I	can’t	let	convicted killers	roam	the	streets	at	their	discretion.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ms.	 Lynch	 will	 have	 that	 charge	 dropped	 immediately	 after	 her	 sentence ends.	You	cannot	try	her	before	then,	so	she	will	not	have	a	previous	record	you can	make	decisions	from.	And,	I	must	add,	to	believe	that	she	would	commit	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">crime,	right	before	she	was	to	be	released,	goes	against	reason.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	sat	back	in	his	chair.	“The	only	reason	I’m	concerned	with	is	what	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">restored	records	will	detail.	We	know	Ms.	Lynch	dumped	the	ship’s	atmosphere</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	two	of	her	crew	resided.	We	also	know	a	blow	to	the	throat	killed	Bruno</p>
<p class="calibre1">Redden.	These	two	events	must	be	explained	in	full.	Until	that	time,	Ms.	Lynch is	a	suspect,	and	as	such,	it	is	reasonable	to	keep	her	in	custody.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have	 you	 any	 evidence,	 right	 now,	 that	 shows	 Ms.	 Lynch	 had	 anything	 to do	with	their	deaths	other	than	what	she’s	already	stated?”	Nancy	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 leaned	 forward	 and	 stared	 directly	 at	 Nancy.	 “No,	 I	 do	 not	 have	 that information.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then,	 Mr.	 Reagan,	 since	 your	 charges	 are	 not	 specific,	 do	 you	 have	 the authority	to	continue	to	hold	Ms.	Lynch	in	confinement?	Her	previous	sentence</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 about	 to	 expire,	 and	 it	 has	 been	 the	 practice	 of	 the	 state	 not	 to	 continue confining	water	miners	if	their	ship	cycles	early. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	seemed	to	think	for	a	moment.	He	looked	at	Pati	as	if	staring	into	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul	and	then	looked	back	at	Nancy.	“I’ll	accept	a	tracking	bracelet	for	the	time being.	Otherwise,	she	returns	to	her	cell	until	you	can	get	the	provost	to	release her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pati,	you	good	with	that?”	Nancy	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Being	 free	 while	 only	 having	 to	 wear	 some	 electronic	 jewelry	 around	 the ankle,	she’d	give	up	her	firstborn	if	she	had	any	kids.	“Sure,	that’ll	be	okay,”	Pati said	instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	we’re	good,”	Nancy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	stood	from	his	chair	and	put	his	tablet	under	his	left	arm.	He	pointed	at Pati,	 “Ms.	 Lynch,	 the	 tracking	 bracelet	 will	 let	 us	 know	 immediately	 when you’re	near	restricted	areas	like	ports	and	shipping	docks.	If	you	get	the	idea	that you	 can	 hop	 on	 a	 freighter	 back	 to	 Earth,	 fine,	 you	 can	 think	 that.	 However,	 if you	enter	a	restricted	area	without	escort,	even	by	mistake,	you’ll	spend	the	rest</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>of	your	pre-trial	time	back	in	your	cell.	And	there’s	nothing	your	attorney	can	do about	that.	Please,	make	it	easy	on	all	of	us,	and	remain	sensible.”	He	turned	and walked	out	the	door	without	shutting	it	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Asshole,”	Pati	said	out	loud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 Pati	 first	 arrived	 on	 Titan,	 Richard	 arranged	 for	 her	 to	 stay	 in	 a	 luxury apartment	 till	 the	 wedding.	 Within	 an	 hour	 of	 Nancy	 Tate	 securing	 her	 release, the	government	also	put	her	up	in	an	apartment,	in	the	low-rent	district.	A	place where	 the	 newly	 arrived	 immigrants	 stayed	 and	 were	 provided	 just	 enough	 to survive	until	they	found	employment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 still	 felt	 like	 heaven	 to	 her.	 The	 ankle	 bracelet	 might	 track	 her,	 but	 that wasn’t	the	same	as	having	a	locked	door	in	front	of	you.	She	could	stay	in	to	eat or	go	to	a	restaurant,	it	was	her	decision,	and	she	didn’t	have	to	decide	either	if she	didn’t	want	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 sat	 back	 on	 her	 leather	 couch.	 Like	 the	 wood	 she	 saw	 in	 the	 police station,	 it	 was	 manufactured.	 She’d	 met	 friends	 of	 Richard	 who	 owned	 the manufacturing	 businesses,	 and	 they	 told	 her	 how	 it	 was	 done.	 She	 didn’t remember	 much,	 except	 that	 if	 you	 have	 enough	 carbon,	 you	 can	 replicate anything	on	Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	made	her	think	of	Richard’s	family,	the	McLears.	How	the	great-great,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">great	 grandfathers	 ransomed	 their	 fortune	 on	 Earth	 to	 build	 a	 company	 that would	supply	billions	of	people	in	space	when	only	thousands	lived	there	at	the time.	 How	 Richard’s	 grandmother	 exploited	 the	 situation	 and	 turned	 their company	 into	 humanity’s	 most	 powerful	 enterprise.	 Richard’s	 father	 and	 his brother	Kerry	continued	the	dominance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	 there	 existed	 a	 pipeline	 of	 liquid	 carbon	 traveling	 to	 the	 inner	 solar system	on	McLear	tankers.	She	had	been	told	it’d	be	economic	Armageddon	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 human	 race	 if	 Richard’s	 family	 ever	 took	 their	 toys	 and	 went	 home.	 She didn’t	know	how	that	would	work,	she	just	wanted	to	go	home	herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And,	 despite	 his	 power,	 Kerry	 McLear	 didn’t	 seem	 to	 want	 revenge	 for	 his brother’s	death.	Maybe	it	was	because	he	would	not	have	to	share	an	inheritance with	his	younger	brother,	but	whatever	the	reason,	he	hadn’t	interfered	with	the investigation	of	Richard’s	death	or	demonstrated	the	least	bit	of	interest. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>Yet,	the	apparition	wanted	revenge.	Could	it	have	been	the	McLear’s	means of	 getting	 it?	 Kerry	 McLear	 was	 astrophysicist	 smart,	 and	 that	 was	 across	 the board	intelligent,	not	just	science.	Maybe	he	arranged	the	incident	that	killed	the life-support	in	her	mining	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Should	 she	 tell	 this	 to	 Nancy?	 She	 already	 told	 her	 about	 the	 apparition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 told	 her	 not	 to	 make	 it	 part	 of	 her	 statement,	 and	 they	 could	 discuss	 it later.	 It	 made	 sense	 since	 nobody	 would	 believe	 the	 apparition	 without	 proof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Good	 thing	 Nancy	 typed	 her	 statement	 into	 a	 tablet	 instead	 of	 a	 straight recording.	Nobody	could	say	Nancy	was	lazy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	time	projected	on	the	far	wall,	reminding	her	that	Nancy	would	stop	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	her	husband	in	thirty	minutes.	They	planned	to	take	her	to	dinner,	and	Pati didn’t	have	much	more	work	to	do	to	get	ready.	She	had	only	to	take	a	shower, </p>
<p class="calibre1">clean	her	teeth	and	nails,	fix	her	hair,	and	choose	her	clothes.	Then	she	needed	to see	 if	 her	 clothes	 fit	 right	 since	 she	 had	 rented	 them	 that	 afternoon.	 She	 could worry	about	the	shoes	she	would	rent	and	wear	after	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,	 being	 ready	 in	 thirty	 minutes	 was	 not	 going	 to	 happen.	 Pati	 got	 up	 and walked	 into	 the	 single	 bedroom.	 Nancy	 was	 the	 only	 friend	 she	 had	 on	 Titan, Pati	thought	she	should	at	least	try	to	make	it	in	forty-five	minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 had	 not	 seen	 the	 sun	 in	 a	 few	 months.	 Then,	 as	 now,	 it	 was	 just	 a	 big pinpoint	 in	 the	 sky.	 But	 to	 see	 it	 through	 the	 transparent	 roof	 made	 her	 feel	 as warm	 as	 if	 she	 was	 on	 a	 terrestrial	 beach.	 Nancy	 couldn’t	 have	 picked	 a	 better place	to	eat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 Tenderloin	 Room	 was	 maybe	 the	 third-best	 restaurant	 at	 Karakorum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Richard	 had	 taken	 her	 to	 all	 twelve	 when	 they	 courted	 because	 he	 could	 easily afford	 to	 buy	 the	 restaurants	 if	 he	 wanted.	 When	 Nancy	 and	 Joe	 brought	 her here,	 Pati	 almost	 had	 to	 refuse	 because	 she	 knew	 she	 couldn’t	 afford	 it.	 Nancy would	 hear	 nothing	 of	 it	 and	 said	 they’d	 happily	 pick	 up	 the	 tab	 for	 someone who	should	be	ready	to	celebrate.	Pati	graciously	accepted	and	hoped	she	could return	the	favor	someday. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 despite	 the	 name,	 none	 of	 the	 meats	 were	 from	 animals.	 Food	 was manufactured	 in	 chemical	 reactors	 and	 the	 process	 produced	 food	 fresher	 and cleaner	 than	 natural	 food	 grown	 or	 raised	 on	 Earth.	 How	 much	 your	 meal	 cost</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>depended	on	how	much	work	the	manufacturers	put	into	getting	it	just	right.	If you	wanted	the	greatest	meal	you	ever	tasted,	you	paid	most	of	your	salary	for	it unless	you	could	afford	to	buy	the	restaurant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’s	your	meal?”	Nancy	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 turned	 her	 attention	 away	 from	 the	 ceiling	 and	 to	 Nancy,	 who	 was wearing	 a	 black	 dress	 with	 gray	 trim.	 Her	 hair	 was	 down	 this	 time.	 “Far	 better than	prison	food,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	guess	I	should	expect	that	answer,”	Nancy	replied,	with	a	laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy’s	 husband,	 in	 his	 brown	 slacks	 and	 blue,	 long-sleeved	 shirt,	 did	 not laugh.	In	fact,	Joe	had	said	little	since	they	sat	down	at	the	table	for	four	in	the middle	 of	 the	 half-filled	 restaurant.	 He	 was	 like	 Pati,	 from	 Earth,	 although	 he came	from	the	southeastern	part	of	North	America.	He	quietly	ate	his	meal	as	if he	 was	 the	 only	 person	 in	 the	 room,	 and	 only	 occasionally	 asked	 Nancy	 a question.	 With	 brown	 hair	 and	 blue	 eyes,	 he	 wasn’t	 bad	 looking,	 except	 being from	 Earth,	 he	 seemed	 a	 midget	 among	 men.	 Although	 he	 was	 a	 midget	 that could	crush	two	men	born	and	raised	off	of	Earth,	Pati	reminded	herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	heard	meat	being	thrown	onto	a	grill.	Then	the	smell	of	spices,	probably</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 garlic,	 floated	 past.	 This	 was	 the	 only	 sit-down	 restaurant	 without	 a	 wall between	 the	 kitchen	 and	 dining	 area.	 The	 owners	 used	 that	 advantage	 for	 all	 it was	worth,	and	it	particularly	affected	Pati	because	the	food	on	her	mining	ship didn’t	register	on	an	aroma	scale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nancy,	 thanks	 for	 taking	 me	 out.	 Ever	 since	 I	 started	 my	 sentence	 on	 the ice-mining	ship,	I	haven’t	had,	well,	a	dining	experience.	And	this	is	just	what	I needed	after	everything	that	happened	the	last	few	days.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 welcome,”	 she	 replied.	 Again,	 her	 husband	 stayed	 silent.	 “How	 do you	like	where	you’re	staying?	It’s	not	what	you're	used	to,	I’m	sure—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	perfect,	Nancy.	Even	though	I	lived	well	being	married	to	a	McLear,	it’s way	better	than	a	jail	cell.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	Joe	nodded	to	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	think	we’ll	be	able	to	keep	you	from	sitting	in	another	jail	cell	this time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 assumed	 she	 meant	 the	 trial	 over	 her	 crew’s	 mutiny,	 a	 subject	 she	 still had	much	to	talk	about.	“I	need	the	whole	truth	to	come	out,”	Pati	said.	“If	they can	rebuild	the	ship’s	records,	I’m	all	for	it,	because	I	want	proof	that	I	did	what I	had	to	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 shook	 her	 head,	 “Pati,	 we	 don’t	 even	 need	 that.	 Your	 word	 will	 be good	 enough.	 I	 know	 we’re	 going	 against	 Jack	 Reagan,	 and	 he’s	 really	 good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately	for	him,	he’s	not	a	superman.	He’ll	have	to	let	you	go,	or	we’ll	be up	in	front	of	the	JJ	and	he’ll	get	beat	bad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>“I	 don’t	 want	 my	 life	 determined	 by	 a	 computer,”	 Pati	 said.	 	 She	 paused	 a moment	 and	 thought	 about	 the	 next	 question	 on	 her	 mind.	 She	 hadn’t	 asked before	because	Nancy	wanted	her	to	focus	on	her	case.	Now,	however,	the	time</p>
<p class="calibre1">might	be	right.	“Nancy,	is	there	any	way	I	can	still	make	that	next	cruiser	back	to Earth?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 stopped	 eating	 and	 didn’t	 look	 hopeful.	 “Pati,	 I’ll	 do	 all	 I	 can	 do	 to keep	 you	 on	 schedule.	 But	 you	 have	 to	 understand,	 it	 depends	 on	 what	 Jack Reagan	does.	If	he	wants	to	drag	this	out,	you’ll	be	here	till	we	finish.	You	can’t leave	until	the	state	decides	you	can	or	we	force	it.	There’s	no	other	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	suspected	as	much.	She	came	to	terms	with	the	probability	after	getting</p>
<p class="calibre1">settled	 in	 her	 apartment,	 realizing	 she	 might	 stay	 there	 longer	 than	 she	 hoped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,”	 Pati	 said.	 “I	 understand	 you’re	 doing	 your	 best.	 I’ll	 still	 be researching	trips	home	while	we	wait,	though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	blame	you,”	Joe	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 looked	 irritated,	 and	 she	 didn’t	 give	 Joe	 a	 positive	 look	 after	 his comment.	She	didn’t	say	a	word	either	and	resumed	eating	her	meal.	Pati	did	the same	and	hoped	the	chill	she	just	felt	was	the	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	shook	his	head	before	he	took	his	next	bite.	Then,	he	wolfed	down	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	left	on	his	plate.	He	stood	up.	“Nance,”	he	said.	“I	need	to	be	getting	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	called	the	waiter	over.	A	short	robot,	just	taller	than	a	meter	high,	made its	way	on	tracks	through	the	line	of	tables.	When	the	robot	arrived,	Joe	handed it	 his	 card	 to	 read.	 The	 robot	 had	 small	 arms,	 just	 long	 enough	 to	 reach	 to	 the other	side	of	the	table.	It	took	the	card,	placed	it	on	a	scanner	on	its	body,	and returned	it	to	Joe.	“Don’t	let	my	wife	put	this	on	her	business	account,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	out,	saying	nothing	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um,	what	happened?”	Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	looked	as	if	she’d	seen	a	ghost.	“I	forgot	to	tell	you,	he	was	friends</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	Bruno	Redden.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	ah,	how	did	they	get	to	know	each	other?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bruno	 helped	 Joe	 get	 his	 first	 job	 working	 construction	 when	 he	 arrived from	 Earth.	 They	 hadn’t	 talked	 in	 years,	 not	 since	 Joe	 started	 working	 at	 the spaceport.	I	think	Joe	feels	some	loyalty	towards	him,	and	he’s	not	sure	you’re innocent	when	it	comes	to	his	death.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 stopped	 eating	 and	 exhaled	 a	 deep	 breath.	 Without	 the	 recordings, everyone	could	come	to	their	own	conclusion	about	what	happened.	Maybe	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">state	couldn’t	convict	her,	but	the	rest	of	her	life	they’d	call	her	a	murderer	four times	 over.	 All	 she	 could	 do	 was	 argue.	 She	 had	 no	 proof	 each	 time	 was	 an accident	or	self-defense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Except,	that	alien	that	appeared	to	her	did	take	credit	for	all	that	happened.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>stated	it	was	in	Richard	when	she	hit	him.	In	fact,	it	blamed	her	for	stopping	its plans.	It	also	took	credit	for	disabling	the	life	support	system	on	the	mining	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	she	could	show	those	aliens	were	real	and	lived	here	on	Titan,	then	the	people would	have	to	take	her	account	of	her	actions	more	seriously.	“Nancy,	I	want	to make	an	announcement	about	those	aliens	I	told	you	about,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 almost	 choked	 on	 her	 food.	 She	 finished	 swallowing	 and	 reached	 a hand	 over	 to	 Pati’s	 wrist.	 “Pati,”	 she	 whispered,	 “we’ve	 been	 through	 this	 in private,	and	I’ve	pointed	out	to	you	we	can’t	make	any	such	statement	until	your status	is	secure.	With	the	records	of	the	flight	compromised,	the	only	account	of what	happened	is	your	recollection.	If	you	say	it	happened,	no	one	else	can	say different	 without	 physical	 proof.	 And	 if	 Jack	 Reagan	 tries,	 he’ll	 come	 close	 to disbarment.”	Nancy	released	her	wrist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everyone	thinks	I’m	a	murderer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	won’t	fix	that	impression	if	you’re	on	a	thirty-year	trip	to	Earth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	statement	chilled	Pati’s	bones.	It	reminded	her	that	survival	was	all	that mattered,	just	like	when	the	life	support	died	on	the	mining	ship.	The	truth	about the	 aliens	 could	 wait	 until	 she	 had	 certainty.	 “Okay,	 you’ve	 made	 your	 point,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,	 no	 more	 talk	 about	 that	 subject	 until	 you’re	 on	 your	 way	 back	 to Earth.	Is	that	clear?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	nodded	and	finished	the	last	bites	on	her	plate.	Nancy	did	the	same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wish	I	could	stay	and	talk,	Pati,	but	I	think	we’ll	see	enough	of	each	other in	 the	 next	 few	 days.”	 She	 stood	 up	 from	 the	 table.	 “We	 don’t	 see	 each	 other until	Monday,	so	what	do	you	have	planned	for	your	Sunday?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Besides	straightening	out	my	apartment,	I’m	going	for	a	gravity	treatment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	shuddered.	“Oh,	I	hate	those.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	need	them	if	I’m	going	back	to	Earth.	Especially	with	all	the	work	I	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">doing	in	zero	gravity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	shook	her	head.	“I	haven’t	been	to	one	in	years.	I’m	scared	to	think</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	it	would	do	to	me	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 need	 to	 get	 it	 done,	 Nancy.	 You	 might	 want	 to	 go	 to	 Earth	 someday, and	you	won’t	be	able	if	you	wait	too	long.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	Earth	really	worth	it?	For	someone	like	me,	who’s	never	been	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’d	been	a	long	day,	and	Pati	didn’t	feel	like	providing	a	dissertation	on	the benefits	of	breathing	outdoors.	“I	think	so,”	she	said,	and	then	stood	up.	“We	can talk	about	it	another	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	 right,	 we’ll	 see	 you	 on	 Monday,	 then,”	 Nancy	 said.	 She	 turned	 and walked	out	along	the	rows	of	tables. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 waited	 for	 Nancy	 to	 walk	 past	 the	 shops	 around	 the	 restaurant	 seating. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>Then,	Pati	walked	out	herself.	It	was	time	to	learn	how	to	live	frugally	again,	and getting	a	good	night's	sleep	was	probably	the	best	place	to	start. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	waited	outside	the	clinic.	She	hated	the	experience	but	had	no	option	if	she wanted	 to	 return	 to	 Earth	 and	 be	 capable	 of	 living	 in	 a	 single	 gravity.	 The McLears	had	a	private	facility	on	Picus	she	used	before;	here,	she	had	to	share with	 the	 public.	 Three	 months	 on	 the	 mining	 ship	 made	 her	 privacy	 less	 of	 a problem	and	she	walked	into	the	office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	morning,”	the	lady	at	the	desk	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	morning,”	Pati	responded.	“I	have	an	appointment	for	8	a.m.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lady	looked	at	the	monitor	on	her	desk.	“Ms.	Lynch,	is	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very	good,	please	have	a	seat.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 took	 a	 seat	 along	 the	 wall	 in	 the	 yellow	 receptionist	 area.	 There	 were two	 video	 displays	 on	 the	 adjacent	 wall,	 both	 showing	 a	 news	 broadcast originating	here	at	Karakorum.	Pati	didn’t	watch	these	shows,	however,	she	did find	 some	 entertainment	 value	 as	 they	 strove	 to	 make	 the	 problems	 of	 a	 small city	newsworthy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 the	 moment,	 it	 talked	 about	 events	 on	 Earth	 and	 in	 the	 satellite	 system. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	 state	 governments	 were	 mad	 at	 others	 and	 threatening	 trade	 restrictions, blockades,	 and	 maybe	 even	 wars.	 Had	 she	 never	 lived	 on	 Earth,	 she’d	 believe such	a	place	was	too	violent	for	anyone	to	live	peacefully.	Having	lived	most	of her	 life	 there,	 she	 knew	 the	 reports	 were	 wrong	 or	 trying	 to	 turn	 insignificant into	critical	for	entertainment	value.	Most	people	on	Titan	didn’t	know	that,	so besides	 their	 physical	 limitations,	 most	 had	 no	 intention	 of	 ever	 traveling	 to Earth.	Which	was	one	reason	this	gravity	clinic	was	so	empty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ready	for	you	now	in	room	‘C,’	Ms.	Lynch,”	the	receptionist	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,”	Pati	replied.	She	stood	up	and	walked	through	the	door	to	the	left</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	receptionist.	She	entered	a	hallway	with	many	doors.	The	doors	to	her	left and	 right	 were	 B	 and	 A,	 so	 she	 walked	 to	 her	 right	 and	 found	 C.	 Inside	 was	 a tree	for	holding	clothes,	and	a	light-blue	table	with	a	hole	in	the	wall	at	its	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	knew	the	drill	and	stripped	naked	before	plopping	onto	the	cold,	plastic</p>
<p class="calibre1">table	with	her	head	next	to	the	hole.	Looking	up,	she	watched	the	white	ceiling</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>as	the	table	slid	her	through	the	hole,	and	into	the	tank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	tank	had	lighting	embedded	in	the	steel	walls	to	prevent	claustrophobia, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which	Pati	was	thankful	for.	There	were	also	hundreds	of	needles	at	the	end	of metal	arms,	which	she	was	less	thankful	for,	but	realized	that’s	just	how	the	job was	done.	The	needles	above	her	extended	and	inserted	into	different	parts	of	her anatomy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 had	 to	 marvel	 at	 the	 precision	 because,	 like	 the	 technique	 of	 an acupuncturist,	 she	 barely	 felt	 the	 insertion.	 While	 this	 happened,	 warm	 water filled	 the	 tank	 and	 allowed	 her	 to	 float.	 The	 table	 retracted	 and	 more	 needles entered	her	body	from	below.	It	would	soon	be	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	manufacturers	of	the	apparatus	claimed	it	was	painless.	They	must	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">never	used	it	themselves	because	the	electric	current	running	through	and	around her	body	didn’t	feel	good.	She	could	say	out	loud	if	the	pain	was	too	much,	but the	first	time	she	did	that,	she	was	told	the	treatment	was	useless	if	she	couldn’t take	more	current.	She	gritted	her	teeth,	and	a	minute	after	the	current	began,	she gritted	harder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 felt	 like	 every	 cubic	 centimeter	 of	 her	 body	 vibrated	 millions	 of	 times every	second.	Except	the	vibrations	wouldn’t	go	in	the	same	direction.	She	tried not	to	scream.	It	was	pain	she	had	to	have,	and	she	would	see	it	through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	counter	displayed	on	the	top	of	the	tank	said	15	seconds	were	left.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">gritted	 her	 teeth	 hard	 again.	 Would	 she	 need	 to	 see	 the	 dentist	 after	 this? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fourteen	seconds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 did	 this	 for	 her	 family.	 She’d	 been	 on	 Titan	 for	 almost	 three	 years	 and had	no	reason	to	stay.	She	had	to	keep	thinking	about	why	she	put	up	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pain.	Eleven	seconds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	tried	to	divorce	her	mind	from	her	body.	The	pain	was	there,	and	getting</p>
<p class="calibre1">worse,	so	she	tried	not	to	pay	attention	to	it.  <i class="calibre3">Pretend	you’re	watching	the	torture</i> <i class="calibre3">happen	 to	 another	 person</i>.	 A	 deep	 breath	 through	 her	 nose	 and	 hold.	 Eight seconds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ehhhhh,”	she	grunted.	She	could	even	feel	the	vibrations	in	her	teeth.	Like</p>
<p class="calibre1">every	 tooth	 had	 a	 toothache	 to	 match	 the	 headache	 she	 felt,	 and	 the	 fire throughout	her	torso,	and	the	feeling	her	legs	were	ready	to	burn	off.	If	only	they would	burn	off	and	stop	hurting.	Four	seconds	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 tried	 to	 rip	 the	 needles	 out	 of	 her	 body,	 but	 her	 body	 failed	 her.	 Her muscles	 would	 not	 obey	 her	 commands.	 She	 tried	 begging,	 which	 didn’t	 work either.	 Then	 she	 just	 stopped,	 too	 exhausted	 to	 do	 anything	 except	 suffer.	 Two seconds,	one	second,	and	she	was	finished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 breathing	 was	 heavy	 and	 fast.	 Like	 every	 gravity	 clinic	 treatment,	 the minutes	 after	 the	 treatment	 were	 an	 elation	 that	 poured	 over	 her	 like	 the	 water</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>that	receded.	She	knew	her	body	would	react	to	the	torture	by	increasing	muscle mass	 and	 bone	 density,	 everything	 she’d	 need	 to	 live	 in	 a	 single	 gravity.	 This would	 allow	 her	 to	 walk	 those	 docks	 in	 Dingle	 with	 her	 family.	 Maybe	 the people	here	on	Titan	didn’t	believe	it	was	worth	it.	She	wouldn’t	waste	her	time trying	to	explain	what	she	couldn’t	explain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 needles	 left	 her	 body	 and	 the	 table	 retracted	 back	 into	 the	 changing room.	She	took	a	few	minutes	to	compose	herself	before	sitting	up	on	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	almost	laughed,	thinking	about	how	she’ll	worry	about	sagging	breasts	back on	Earth.	Oh	well,	there	were	medical	procedures	for	that,	too,	and	she	would	be happy	to	cross	that	bridge	when	the	time	came. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 stood	 up	 from	 the	 table	 and	 used	 the	 towel	 hanging	 on	 the	 wall.	 Once dried,	she	put	her	clothes	back	on	and	used	her	brush	to	straighten	her	wet	hair	in the	mirror.	Once	completed,	she	walked	back	into	the	hallway	and	out	the	door</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	receptionist’s	office.	Her	first	action	would	be	to	schedule	an	appointment for	the	next	week. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a><b class="calibre2">5	Working	Stiff</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	didn’t	need	to	meet	with	Nancy	until	the	afternoon,	which	gave	her	a	chance to	attend	the	training	for	her	new	job.	It	also	meant	she	couldn’t	sleep	in,	and	she rose	when	the	alarm	buzzed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kerry	 McLear	 had	 decided	 he	 wouldn’t	 subsidize	 her	 lifestyle	 once	 she’d finished	 her	 sentence.	 The	 unusual	 way	 she	 finished	 didn’t	 seem	 to	 make	 a difference	in	that	attitude,	and	she	had	very	little	money	at	the	moment.	All	she could	rely	on	was	the	basics:	housing,	food,	and	clothes	from	social	services.	If she	wanted	any	money,	she	had	to	get	out	and	work,	and	social	services	gave	her a	list	of	jobs	needing	workers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	of	the	drilling	companies	would	take	her	in	a	heartbeat,	except	it	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">mean	 a	 long	 time	 of	 training,	 and	 she’d	 have	 to	 work	 full	 time	 every	 day.	 She didn’t	need	that	and	also	needed	her	time	for	the	trial.	Most	of	those	companies would	probably	reject	her	anyway	since	her	intentions	to	return	to	Earth	were	a public	record. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead,	she	worked	for	the	government,	picking	a	job	that	involved	keeping</p>
<p class="calibre1">Karakorum	 maintained.	 The	 particular	 job	 she	 chose	 involved	 exterior</p>
<p class="calibre1">maintenance,	a	nice	benefit	in	that	few	people	would	see	her	outside	the	city,	and none	would	recognize	her	in	an	excursion	suit	and	helmet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fortunately,	 excursions	 were	 a	 regular	 part	 of	 her	 previous	 ice-mining	 job. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately,	her	earlier	excursions	had	taken	place	in	a	vacuum.	Titan,	on	the other	hand,	had	an	atmosphere,	which	meant	the	breathing	equipment	would	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">radically	different.	It	also	meant	she	would	be	placed	at	the	level	of	a	secondary school	graduate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 had	 already	 picked	 out	 the	 button-down	 white	 shirt	 with	 tan	 pants	 and brown	 boots	 the	 night	 before,	 and	 they	 were	 waiting	 for	 her	 as	 soon	 as	 she cleaned	 up.	 A	 simple	 breakfast,	 and	 she	 was	 on	 her	 way	 to	 the	 trolley	 station. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heading	 north	 on	 Main	 Street,	 she	 rode	 through	 a	 quick	 two	 stops	 and disembarked	 with	 a	 large	 crowd	 going	 in	 the	 same	 direction.	 The	 North Maintenance	Hall	was	on	the	right	of	the	trolley	route,	and	with	the	crowd	she walked	through	the	large	opening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	crowd	was	mostly	men,	although	there	were	a	few	women,	and	nobody</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	 to	 notice	 Pati	 as	 out	 of	 the	 ordinary.	 She	 was	 also	 shorter	 than	 most, which	 meant	 most	 of	 the	 workers	 were	 Titan-born.	 Like	 her	 gender,	 her	 height and	place	of	birth	were	not	out	of	the	ordinary	for	this	crowd,	and	she	worried</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>less	about	the	problems	of	being	recognized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	security	desk	sat	in	the	middle	of	the	entrance	like	an	island	in	the	middle of	 a	 river	 of	 people	 walking	 by.	 A	 male	 and	 female	 guard	 sat	 there,	 apparently not	worried	about	the	crowd	entering.	Pati	noticed	a	small	sign	on	the	desk	and followed	 the	 instructions	 for	 those	 attending	 orientation	 to	 enter	 the	 classroom on	 her	 right.	 The	 door	 was	 transparent,	 and	 she	 could	 see	 two	 people	 in	 there already.	It	slid	open	as	she	approached,	and	she	took	a	front	seat.	The	two	people didn’t	take	notice	of	her,	or	of	each	other,	and	sat	to	the	back	of	the	twenty-seat room.	 Up	 front	 was	 a	 lady,	 maybe	 in	 her	 forties,	 who	 worked	 on	 some	 sort of	equipment	that	sat	on	a	desk.	When	Pati	took	her	seat,	the	lady	looked	up	at the	students	and	stopped	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	I	think	that’s	everyone,”	the	lady	at	the	desk	said.	She	was	taller	than Pati	 and	 had	 her	 dark	 hair	 pulled	 back,	 which	 highlighted	 a	 few	 gray	 streaks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	 most	 everyone	 on	 Titan,	 she	 had	 no	 wrinkles,	 and	 her	 complexion	 was	 a perfect	light	brown.	“You’re	here	this	morning	because	we	need	to	educate	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	equipment	you’ll	use	to	survive	outside.	My	name	is	Dr.	Melanie	Smith, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 I’m	 considered	 the	 expert	 on	 Karakorum	 for	 extraterrestrial	 survival equipment.	Any	questions?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	didn’t	have	any,	and	the	other	two	students	made	no	noise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,	then	I	have	a	few	questions.	Has	anyone	here	ever	worked	outside	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">Earth-like	atmosphere?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	raised	her	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great,	tell	us	what	that	entailed,	Ms.	Lynch,	is	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	nodded.	“I	had	to	do	extravehicular	work	on	a	water-mining	ship,”	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyone	else?”	Dr.	Smith	asked.	After	a	moment	of	silence,	she	continued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	you	did,	Ms.	Lynch,	is	related	to	the	work	here	on	Titan,	except	you	will not	 be	 working	 in	 a	 vacuum	 like	 in	 space.	 Here,	 the	 pressure	 outside	 the	 steel walls	of	Karakorum	is	greater	than	on	Earth.	Not	significantly,	so,	you	will	not blow	up	like	a	balloon	if	your	skin	is	exposed	to	the	atmosphere.”	She	paused, apparently	 for	 effect.	 “Now,	 the	 pressure	 of	 the	 atmosphere	 is	 not	 the	 only similarity	 to	 Earth,	 the	 composition	 of	 the	 atmosphere	 on	 Titan	 is	 almost	 pure nitrogen.	 On	 Earth,	 it’s	 eighty	 percent.	 And	 while	 I	 said	 the	 compositions	 are similar,	 it’s	 that	 twenty	 percent	 that	 makes	 all	 the	 difference	 because	 on	 Earth, the	twenty	percent	is	the	oxygen	we	need	to	live.	Yes,	Mr.	Thales.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 turned	 to	 look	 at	 the	 young	 guy	 with	 his	 hand	 up.	 “So,	 we	 can	 walk outside	with	only	an	air	recycler?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	 Smith	 raised	 her	 right	 index	 finger.	 “You’re	 close,	 but	 remember	 we’re here	orbiting	Saturn.	The	temperature	is	about	a	hundred	Kelvin	on	a	warm	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>If	 you’re	 not	 wearing	 the	 insulated	 suits,	 the	 water	 in	 your	 body	 will	 freeze quite	quickly.	You’ll	be	dead	before	it	actually	freezes,	but	I’m	sure	you	get	my point.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	thought	gave	Pati	another	reason	to	want	to	go	back	to	Earth.	When	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">left	the	mining	ship	in	Saturn	orbit,	it	was	usually	no	longer	than	an	hour.	This job	 would	 be	 eight	 hours	 outside,	 with	 two	 breaks	 and	 a	 lunch.	 When	 it	 came time	to	suit	up	for	work,	she	would	definitely	not	worry	about	style	points. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	 now	 I	 want	 to	 focus	 on	 the	 breathing	 apparatus	 of	 choice	 here	 on Titan.”	 Dr.	 Smith	 stood	 up	 the	 apparatus	 she	 was	 working	 with	 on	 the	 desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	be	assigned	one	of	these	each	day	before	your	shift,	and	we’ve	qualified experts	 who	 maintain	 and	 test	 these	 to	 make	 sure	 you	 don’t	 run	 into	 problems outside	 the	 walls.	 It’s	 an	 air	 recycler	 which	 pumps	 the	 air	 you	 breathe	 out through	 a	 carbon	 dioxide	 scrubber.	 This	 scrubber	 not	 only	 removes	 the	 gas before	 recycling	 to	 your	 breathing	 zone	 but	 will	 crack	 enough	 of	 the	 carbon dioxide	back	into	oxygen	so	you	can	work	a	full	eight-hours	without	a	recharge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	 times,	 the	 only	 limit	 you	 have	 is	 the	 twelve-hour	 battery.”	 She	 pulled	 a metal	piece	off	the	pack	and	held	it	up.	Then	she	smiled,	“Oh,	and	the	time	limit the	Worker’s	Guild	negotiated	for	a	day’s	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	meeting	with	Nancy	the	day	before	did	not	go	well.		The	bad	news	was	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">state	 would	 not	 negotiate	 an	 immediate	 release.	 Nancy	 said	 she	 offered everything	 except	 Pati’s	 firstborn,	 and	 Jack	 Reagan	 wouldn’t	 go	 for	 it.	 He seemed	determined	to	try	the	case	no	matter	how	shaky	the	ground	the	case	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 meant	 she	 could	 not	 leave	 for	 Earth	 as	 scheduled.	 She’d	 have	 to	 find another	 trip	 months	 in	 the	 future,	 and	 the	 arrival	 time	 would	 be	 more	 months after	that.	Earth	would	not	happen	for	a	while. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Other	than	that	significant	drawback,	there	was	no	bad	news.	Nancy	assured</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 the	 records	 on	 the	 mining	 ship	 had	 not	 been	 reconstructed,	 which	 again meant	 her	 account	 was	 the	 only	 record	 to	 judge	 with.	 The	 engineers	 tasked	 to rebuild	the	records	had	not	sounded	positive,	said	that	they	were	working	on	it, and	expected	to	have	a	final	decision	soon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	tried	to	bring	up	the	alien	encounter	again,	and	Nancy	wouldn’t	hear	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>it.	 Nancy	 maintained	 the	 defense	 needed	 to	 be	 simple	 to	 be	 effective,	 and	 the introduction	 of	 such	 information	 would	 only	 allow	 the	 prosecutors	 an	 angle	 to dispute	 her	 testimony.	 Pati	 countered	 the	 aliens	 would	 explain	 why	 the	 records were	 missing	 and	 provide	 a	 good	 explanation	 why	 the	 life	 support	 systems failed.	 Nancy,	 being	 the	 professional	 debater,	 pointed	 out	 the	 twins	 could	 have arranged	 the	 whole	 thing	 trying	 to	 get	 rid	 of	 her,	 or	 the	 lack	 of	 power	 to	 life support	could	have	affected	other	systems,	or,	one	could	pick	any	reason	because it	didn’t	matter.	It	wasn’t	Nancy’s	job	to	determine	exactly	what	happened,	only to	 demonstrate	 Pati	 Lynch	 could	 not	 have	 acted	 in	 any	 other	 way	 to	 defend herself.	To	go	over	and	beyond	in	her	case	could	call	into	question	that	defense and	 result	 in	 a	 conviction	 on	 a	 lesser	 charge.	 That	 would	 mean	 a	 longer	 time before	leaving	Titan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Nancy	raised	the	flag	of	staying	longer,	Pati	dropped	the	point	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">aliens.	 Nancy	 did	 say	 that	 if	 someone	 else	 independently	 established	 the existence	of	these	aliens	before	the	trial	ended,	she	would	consider	entry	of	the evidence.	Otherwise,	without	facts	to	support,	it	could	only	hurt	her	case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 left	 Nancy’s	 office	 late	 in	 the	 evening.	 She	 returned	 to	 her	 apartment, eating	 a	 quick	 meal	 and	 going	 straight	 to	 sleep.	 The	 alarm	 woke	 her	 the	 next morning,	and	again,	she	felt	as	if	she’d	just	gone	to	bed.	Pati	even	checked	twice to	 make	 sure	 the	 clock	 was	 on	 morning	 time.	 She’d	 dreamed	 of	 being	 back	 in Ireland,	 and	 it	 felt	 wonderful	 if	 also	 kind	 of	 strange.	 A	 strangeness	 that	 didn’t matter,	because	she	had	to	get	to	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	arrived	for	work	early,	picked	up	her	suit	at	the	tool	shop,	and	hopped	into the	 changing	 room.	 After	 working	 on	 the	 ice-mining	 ship,	 she	 had	 no	 issue stripping	down	to	workout	clothes	in	front	of	her	coworkers	to	put	on	the	black, insulated	 bodysuit	 over	 her	 torso	 and	 extremities.	 The	 gloves	 and	 boots	 she’d don	right	before	walking	to	her	transport,	and	she’d	put	the	helmet	on	during	the transport. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	job	today	was	a	simple	one:	follow	the	NDT	robot	out	to	its	testing	zone</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	watch	it	do	its	job.	The	robot	climbed	the	outside	walls	of	Karakorum	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">used	 ultrasound	 to	 determine	 the	 thickness	 of	 those	 walls.	 The	 NDT	 stood	 for non-destructive	 testing,	 which	 was	 good	 because	 lots	 of	 people	 living	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>Karakorum	needed	those	walls	to	remain	in	good	shape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During	 the	 morning	 brief,	 Pati	 made	 the	 mistake	 of	 asking	 her	 boss,	 Larry, why	 the	 robots	 couldn’t	 just	 test	 from	 the	 inside.	 There	 were	 eleven	 other workers	in	there,	and	none	of	the	others	were	newbies	like	herself.	Larry	wasn’t mean	about	his	response,	he	just	let	her	know	that	the	insides	of	those	walls	had construction	attached	and	that	they	must	rip	down	buildings	to	get	to	those	walls from	 the	 inside.	 Her	 coworkers	 weren’t	 so	 cordial,	 and	 she	 didn’t	 think	 she’d have	a	problem	refusing	to	go	out	for	a	drink	with	them	after	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	 the	 suit	 was	 on,	 she	 walked	 out	 and	 picked	 up	 her	 helmet,	 breathing apparatus,	gloves,	and	boots.	Everything	was	tailored,	and	when	she	tried	on	the gloves,	they	fit	very	well.	The	boots	slipped	on,	and	she	walked	over	to	the	bus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	followed	her	similarly	dressed	coworkers	into	the	vehicle	and	walked	to	the back	past	the	other	eleven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 the	 newbie,	 she	 got	 the	 assignment	 farthest	 away.	 The	 bus	 would	 drive out	of	the	airlock,	and	then	down	along	the	outside	wall	of	Karakorum	dropping off	workers	as	it	went.	After	it	dropped	off	Pati,	the	bus	would	return	and	wait for	four	hours,	when	it	would	go	back	out	and	pick	everyone	up	for	a	one-hour</p>
<p class="calibre1">lunch.	The	whole	scheme	was	repeated	in	the	afternoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bus	rose	to	get	clearance	after	Pati	boarded.	It	drove	into	the	airlock,	and the	first	door	shut	behind	it.	The	airlock	pressurized	to	fifty	percent	excess	with mostly	nitrogen	and	a	little	oxygen.	Pati	didn’t	notice	other	than	a	breeze	from the	additional	air.	The	second	door	then	opened,	letting	it	drive	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	nighttime	and	would	be	for	the	next	few	days.	Lights	attached	to	poles</p>
<p class="calibre1">allowed	hazy	visibility	along	the	road	built	around	Karakorum’s	walls.	The	bus stopped.	A	mechanical	arm	extended	on	the	right	side	and	picked	up	a	package. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 arm	 attached	 the	 package	 to	 the	 outside	 of	 the	 vehicle,	 and	 the	 trip	 was resumed.	 The	 bus	 crawled	 along,	 seemingly	 in	 no	 hurry	 to	 get	 them	 to	 their stations,	 and	 Pati	 had	 been	 instructed	 to	 use	 the	 time	 to	 check	 her	 breathing equipment.	She	noticed	her	coworkers	were	busy	at	it,	so	she	better	do	it,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside,	the	bus	had	retrieved	a	package	of	liquid	oxygen	cartridges	that	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	her	coworkers	would	attach	to	their	rebreathers	for	a	supplemental	source	of oxygen.	 Most	 of	 the	 rebreather	 apparatus	 she’d	 strap	 on	 her	 back,	 with	 a	 tube hanging	down	to	connect	a	deciliter-size	cartridge	of	liquid	oxygen.	The	package outside	 was	 full	 of	 these	 containers,	 and	 Pati	 would	 pick	 one	 up	 when	 she stepped	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 bus	 stopped,	 which	 she	 barely	 noticed	 as	 it	 traveled	 so	 slowly,	 and	 the doors	 opened	 for	 the	 first	 of	 her	 coworkers	 to	 get	 out.	 There	 was	 no	 airlock because	 other	 than	 the	 temperature,	 the	 atmospheres	 were	 similar,	 and	 a	 door open	for	a	few	seconds	would	not	deplete	the	oxygen	in	the	inside	atmosphere. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a>The	bus	plodded	forward	once	again,	and	Pati	rode	standing	till	all	her	other coworkers	 had	 gotten	 off.	 Her	 job	 site	 was	 a	 little	 farther,	 and	 she	 finally connected	 the	 tubes	 from	 her	 rebreather	 to	 her	 helmet.	 She	 activated	 the rebreather	 to	 make	 sure	 she	 heard	 the	 motor	 humming,	 and	 all	 arrows	 were	 in the	 right	 direction.	 She	 checked	 the	 connections	 again	 and	 then	 placed	 the helmet	on	her	head.	She	took	a	breath	and	all	seemed	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 shuffled	 toward	 the	 door.	 When	 the	 bus	 stopped,	 she	 waited	 for	 the doors	to	open	and	then	exited.	She	immediately	opened	the	package	fastened	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	bus	and	pulled	out	an	oxygen	cartridge.	Pati	hooked	the	cartridge	to	the	line hanging	 next	 to	 her	 right	 arm.	 Outside	 on	 Titan,	 it	 was	 nearly	 cool	 enough	 for liquid	oxygen,	so	it	was	easier,	more	efficient,	and	safer	to	bring	that	along	than compressed	 gas.	 At	 least	 that’s	 what	 Dr.	 Smith	 told	 her,	 but	 she	 couldn’t remember	why. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	half-a-meter-high	NDT	robot	disembarked	from	the	back	of	the	bus	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">rolled	toward	Pati.	The	bus	drove	down	a	short	distance	and	turned	around	about the	time	the	robot	stopped	in	front	of	her.	Pati	looked	to	see	the	four	lights	on	the robot’s	control	panel	were	green,	and	she	pushed	the	button	next	to	those	lights to	start	it	working. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bus	passed	behind	her,	and	she	followed	the	robot	to	the	wall	about	ten</p>
<p class="calibre1">meters	from	the	road.	This	section	of	Karakorum	looked	like	a	monster	drinking can	 dug	 into	 the	 ground.	 She	 knew	 it	 was	 a	 hundred	 meters	 to	 the	 top	 and	 a thousand	 meters	 to	 the	 other	 side.	 The	 robot	 crawled	 onto	 the	 wall	 and	 slowly climbed.	It	made	no	sound,	which	actually	would	carry	better	on	Titan	than	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Earth.	Except	anyone	outside	to	hear	that	sound	would	also	be	wearing	a	helmet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	backed	up	to	get	a	better	view	of	the	robot,	testing	the	thickness	of	the hull	 using	 ultrasound	 as	 it	 went.	 After	 ten	 minutes,	 it	 reached	 the	 top	 of	 this section	 of	 Karakorum.	 Then,	 the	 robot	 shifted	 over	 its	 one-meter	 width	 and crawled	back	down,	repeating	the	process.	To	her	left	was	the	twenty-two	meters remaining	 to	 be	 completed	 before	 lunch.	 The	 old	 term,	 “watching	 paint	 dry,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">came	to	mind.	And	although	she	never	painted,	or	knew	someone	who	did,	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	now	understand	the	meaning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	hours	later,	not	only	was	she	bored,	but	she	was	getting	a	headache.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">robot	was	half	done,	right	on	schedule;	Pati,	however,	was	wondering	how	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	of	this	she	could	take.	She	rubbed	her	helmet	instead	of	rubbing	her	head, which	provided	no	relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	then	remembered	she	had	a	water	tube	for	hydration	in	her	helmet.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned	her	head	and	sucked	in	a	liter	of	water.	Her	helmet	displayed	the	amount, telling	 her	 there	 remained	 another	 liter	 to	 drink.	 She	 also	 had	 two	 pain-killing tablets	placed	within	reach	of	her	mouth.	These,	she	took,	and	hoped	they	would</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next	 to	 the	 oxygen	 cartridge	 hung	 the	 rebreather	 control	 board.	 She	 pulled this	 up	 and	 saw	 her	 battery	 was	 nearly	 at	 full	 charge.	 There	 was	 also	 almost	 a full	cartridge	of	oxygen	remaining.	The	third	parameter	measured	by	the	control board	was	her	CO2	level,	and	it	showed	twenty-times	the	safe	level.	According</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	Dr.	Smith’s	lectures,	that	meant	her	rebreather	wasn’t	rebreathing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 hit	 the	 emergency	 button	 on	 the	 control	 board,	 and	 a	 red	 light illuminated	 in	 her	 helmet	 display.	 A	 response	 was	 displayed	 with	 a	 ten-minute estimated	time	of	arrival. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ten	minutes!”	she	shouted	into	her	helmet.	She	keyed	her	microphone	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">called	her	boss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Larry	here,”	he	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Larry,	 this	 is	 Pati.	 I	 think	 my	 rebreather	 stopped	 working,	 and	 the emergency	response	says	it’ll	take	ten	minutes	to	get	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 heard	 him	 sigh	 on	 the	 other	 end.	 “Okay,	 let	 me	 check	 your	 stats,”	 he said.	She	waited	fifteen	seconds	according	to	her	display,	which	felt	like	a	year at	 the	 moment.	 “All	 right,”	 he	 said,	 “uh,	 Pati,	 it	 seems	 like	 your	 CO2	 level	 is about	 12,000	 ppm,	 which	 isn’t	 good,	 but	 you	 won’t	 die	 anytime	 soon	 either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don’t	worry	about	the	ten	minutes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	head	is	killing	me,	Larry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bleed	a	little	more	liquid	oxygen	into	the	line.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 complied	 by	 squeezing	 a	 valve	 fastened	 to	 the	 small	 cartridge,	 but	 she didn’t	feel	any	better.	Her	head	hurt,	and	the	pickup	was	still	eight	minutes	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	she	went	outside	her	mining	ship,	she	knew	a	malfunction	in	her	respirator would	mean	immediate	death.	These	people	didn’t	think	immediate	death	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">critical	situation,	at	least	not	for	a	new	hire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	working,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’ll	take	a	few	minutes.	Try	to	calm	down	because	you’re	raising	your	CO2</p>
<p class="calibre1">levels	faster	than	normal.	I’ll	see	you	when	you	return.”	He	signed	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	tried	to	calm	down,	except	the	sound	of	her	breathing	filled	the	inside	of her	helmet,	and	her	breathing	rate	increased,	which	would	hasten	her	death.	She tried	again	to	calm	down	and	bled	a	little	more	of	the	liquid	oxygen	into	the	line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	time	she	noticed	a	difference.	She	had	to	think	about	her	situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First,	 this	 wasn’t	 out	 in	 space,	 and	 she	 wasn’t	 in	 a	 vacuum.	 That	 meant instant	death	was	less	likely.	There	was	an	atmosphere	of	nitrogen	all	around	her, and	 all	 it	 lacked	 to	 be	 breathable	 was	 a	 fraction	 of	 oxygen	 in	 it.	 Could	 she exhaust	her	helmet	while	holding	her	breath?	Then	she	could	let	nitrogen	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	atmosphere	refill	her	helmet	and	add	oxygen	from	the	cartridge.	That	might get	her	to	the	breathable	point. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a>There	 were	 six	 minutes	 left.	 She	 checked	 her	 CO2	 level,	 and	 it	 was	 up	 to 13,000ppm.	 The	 liquid	 oxygen	 was	 not	 working	 other	 than	 relieving	 her headache	a	little.	Why	wasn’t	it	reducing	the	CO2? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	robot	went	about	its	duties	as	if	nothing	was	wrong.	It	would	probably</p>
<p class="calibre1">finish	 on	 time	 and	 be	 ready	 for	 pickup	 even	 if	 Pati	 was	 lying	 dead	 next	 to	 the road.	 She	 wondered	 if	 there	 were	 any	 emergency	 supplies	 on	 it,	 except	 it	 was working	 its	 way	 up	 the	 wall.	 By	 the	 time	 it	 returned	 to	 ground,	 the	 emergency response	would	already	be	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 the	 hell,”	 she	 said.	 She	 slipped	 the	 pack	 with	 the	 rebreather	 off	 her back,	without	disconnecting	the	tubes	to	her	helmet.	The	tubes	were	long	enough and	she	sat	the	pack	on	the	hardened	road	in	front	of	her	after	she	sat	down.	The nearest	 streetlamp	 was	 at	 least	 thirty	 meters	 away	 on	 each	 side.	 Not	 enough	 to illuminate	what	she	needed	to	see,	so	she	pulled	out	her	flashlight	to	see	through the	hazy	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First,	 she	 checked	 her	 connections	 as	 Dr.	 Smith	 had	 taught	 her.	 Each	 tube was	firmly	connected,	so	nothing	there.	The	battery	still	had	a	good	charge,	and even	through	the	insulated	glove,	she	could	feel	the	pump	running.	The	arrow	on the	scrubber	pointed	in	the	right	direction.	What	else	could	it	be? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	checks	took	at	least	four	minutes	of	time	she	could	have	spent	worrying</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	 her	 mortality,	 and	 she	 decided	 keeping	 busy	 for	 the	 last	 two	 would	 be	 a good	plan.	After	strapping	the	rebreather	back	on,	she	checked	the	valves	in	her helmet.	 She	 pulled	 a	 release	 valve,	 which	 she	 found	 did	 nothing	 because	 the atmospheres	 were	 equalized.	 She	 blew	 hard	 into	 her	 helmet	 while	 pulling	 the release	 valve	 again	 so	 she	 could	 exhaust	 some	 bad	 air.	 Then	 she	 bled	 more oxygen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 CO2	 monitor	 showed	 no	 improvement.	 She	 thought	 about	 bleeding</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	 oxygen	 but	 wasn’t	 sure	 if	 there	 was	 a	 downside	 to	 that	 or	 not.	 Why couldn’t	they	just	give	her	a	normal	respirator	like	in	space?	All	Dr.	Smith	could go	 on	 about	 was	 how	 much	 easier	 and	 simpler	 the	 rebreather	 was	 compared	 to carrying	air	with	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 believed	 easier	 and	 simpler	 was	 something	 you	 turned	 on	 and	 forgot about.	 Not	 something	 that	 gave	 you	 a	 headache	 the	 first	 time	 you	 used	 it.	 She looked	back	at	the	robot;	it	was	still	going	about	its	business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	she	saw	the	emergency	pickup	tooling	down	the	road	from	the	same</p>
<p class="calibre1">direction	she’d	been	dropped	off	from.	It	had	the	same	rectangular	shape	as	the bus	she	rode	out	on,	although	about	half	as	long.	This	one	had	a	driver	that	she could	 see	 through	 windows	 that	 went	 all	 around	 the	 upper	 half	 of	 the	 vehicle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	driver	stopped	in	front	of	her	and	opened	the	right-side	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	wasn’t	airlocked,	and	he	waved	her	to	get	in,	which	she	didn’t	hesitate.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>assumed	 the	 atmosphere	 in	 the	 emergency	 vehicle	 was	 breathable,	 considering the	driver	had	no	helmet	on,	so	she	took	hers	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	 the	 problem,	 Lynch?”	 the	 driver	 asked.	 He	 was	 of	 some	 Asian descent	 and	 looked	 tall	 enough	 to	 have	 been	 born	 on	 Titan.	 He	 wore	 the	 same insulated	 suit	 as	 Pati	 did	 without	 the	 gloves,	 which	 probably	 allowed	 him	 to control	 his	 bus	 better.	 He	 sat	 before	 a	 dashboard	 with	 buttons	 and	 gages, although	the	traditional	steering	wheel	was	missing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	CO2	level	went	sky	high,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	high?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	pulled	her	control	board	up	to	see.	“It’s	12,000	ppm	right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	want	to	try	breathing	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	 like	 it’s	 poisonous	 or	 anything.	 But	 I	 bet	 your	 scrubber	 stopped working.	Where’s	your	robot?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	on	the	roof,	testing	the	metal.	Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	we	can’t	leave	it	by	itself.	Where’s	your	laser	pointer?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh,”	 she	 said.	 She	 wanted	 to	 ask	 what	 that	 was	 but	 felt	 stupid	 enough already. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	know	where	your	laser	pointer	is,	do	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I,	well,	they	didn’t	give	me	one	this	morning,”	she	said.	Then	she	came</p>
<p class="calibre1">clean.	“What	does	it	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 controls	 your	 robot	 from	 the	 ground.	 That	 way,	 we	 don’t	 have	 to	 wait hours	before	taking	it	in.”	He	reached	into	a	drawer	under	his	dashboard,	pulled out	what	could	easily	be	a	laser	pointer,	and	stood	up.	“Wait	here,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don’t	 expect	 to	 be	 going	 anywhere,”	 she	 said,	 under	 her	 breath,	 and watched	the	driver	pull	gloves	from	another	drawer.	He	stood	up	and	walked	out the	doors	Pati	had	walked	in	through.	She	looked	back	and	saw	a	helmet	sitting on	the	other	side	of	his	chair,	right	as	he	entered	the	atmosphere	of	Titan	without it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	doors	stayed	open,	and	he	didn’t	go	far,	just	enough	to	point	the	laser	at the	robot	and	push	a	few	buttons.	About	five	seconds	later,	he	returned	to	the	bus with	the	doors	shutting	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	did	you	do	that?”	Pati	had	to	ask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	her	up	and	down,	“You’re	from	Earth?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	 got	 a	 lotion	 I	 put	 on	 my	 face	 to	 help	 with	 the	 cold,	 even	 though	 I probably	don’t	need	it	anymore.	When	I	get	out	there,	I	just	hold	my	breath	and squint	my	eyes.	That	quickly,	the	cold	doesn’t	affect	you,	although	you	still	have to	show	some	respect.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>Pati	shook	her	head	as	he	walked	by	her,	and	then	wished	she	hadn’t	because her	headache	had	only	partially	subsided.	She	looked	out	the	windows	then,	saw the	robot	climbing	down	from	the	roof,	and	then	make	its	way	to	the	back	of	the emergency	vehicle.	When	she	heard	the	hatch	close	behind	it,	the	driver	started the	vehicle	and	drove	back	to	the	shop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	 what’s	 wrong	 with	 your	 rebreather	 again?”	 Larry	 asked.	 When	 the	 bus driver	brought	her	back	to	the	shop,	Larry	was	waiting	and	took	the	rebreather from	 her.	 He	 then	 instructed	 her	 to	 change	 out	 of	 her	 suit	 and	 meet	 him	 in	 the conference	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Larry	was	an	older	American	of	Italian	descent.	He’d	traveled	to	Titan	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">years	 ago	 and	 was	 one	 of	 the	 few	 males	 here	 she	 was	 taller	 than.	 His	 greasy black	 hair	 and	 Roman	 nose	 documented	 his	 ancestry	 as	 well	 as	 any	 DNA	 test could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	what	went	wrong,”	she	said.	“I	just	know	my	CO2	levels	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">too	high.	And	you	had	the	numbers	like	I	did.	Plus,	why	would	I	have	such	a	bad headache	if	I	was	dreaming	up	the	problem?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shrugged.	“Well,	it’s	good	you	had	the	headache	and	didn’t	pass	out.	We</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	have	had	to	come	out	and	retrieve	you	before	you	died.	Although,	I	wish	I could	 say	 I	 was	 confident	 our	 emergency	 response	 was	 a	 perfect	 process.”	 He looked	back	at	the	rebreather	on	the	table	and	shook	his	head.	“I’m	not	arguing that	 your	 levels	 went	 up,	 Lynch.	 I	 just	 think	 you	 might	 have	 been	 doing something	wrong	out	there	that	caused	them	to	go	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 could	 I	 have	 done	 wrong?	 I	 followed	 all	 the	 checks	 before	 I	 loaded the	bus,	and	I	did	another	check	on	the	bus	on	the	way	out	like	I	was	supposed to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 bent	 over	 and	 shook	 two	 of	 the	 line	 connections.	 He	 then	 grabbed	 the scrubber	 and	 lifted	 the	 whole	 rebreather	 from	 that	 point.	 He	 looked	 into	 the hose-helmet	openings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	saw	him	licking	his	lips,	running	his	tongue	back	and	forth	while	staring at	the	rebreather.	He	stood	back	up	and	tightened	his	mouth.	“Damn	if	I	can	tell what’s	 wrong	 with	 it,”	 he	 said.	 He	 looked	 back	 at	 Pati.	 “I	 can’t	 find	 a	 single thing	 wrong	 with	 this.	 The	 battery	 is	 charged,	 the	 scrubber	 was	 just	 recycled</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>yesterday,	no	connections	are	loose,	and	as	far	as	I	can	tell,	there’s	no	blockage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Exceept,	I	can’t	say	for	certain	about	the	blockage.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	blockage	might	be	it,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	don’t	think	that	at	all,	because	the	oxygen	you	were	bleeding	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lines	 was	 making	 it	 through.	 I’m	 only	 not	 sure	 about	 the	 blockage	 because	 I haven’t	 physically	 examined	 each	 line	 and	 determined	 their	 condition.”	 He	 put his	hands	on	his	hips.	“My	point	is,	I’m	not	ruling	out	operator	error,	Lynch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	had	had	enough.	She’d	done	everything	according	to	instructions.	Now, </p>
<p class="calibre1">this	clown	wants	to	blame	her.	“If	it’s	operator	error,”	she	said,	“then	you	must be	 smart	 enough	 to	 know	 what	 my	 error	 was.	 So	 why	 don’t	 you	 enlighten	 this poor	little	misguided	minion	who	can’t	even	figure	out	what	she’s	breathing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 lighting	 was	 bright	 in	 the	 conference	 room,	 and	 white	 display	 walls ringed	 the	 area.	 It	 made	 seeing	 the	 blood	 rush	 to	 his	 face	 that	 much	 easier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lynch,”	he	said.	“If	you	plan	on	having	a	job	at	the	end	of	this	day,	I’d	watch my	choice	of	words.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Little	 bastard, </i>	 she	 thought.	 An	 ugly	 little	 runt	 with	 that	 smug	 look	 on	 his face	trying	to	lord	over	her	like	he	held	the	key	to	her	existence.	It	was	like	if	she didn’t	comply	with	his	wishes	and	desires,	she’d	be	out	on	the	street	begging	for food	and	shelter.	She	clenched	her	right	fist,	held	it	at	her	side,	and	tried	to	stare him	down.	She	started	to	raise	her	fist	and	then	stopped.	She	had	to	cool	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 a	 trial	 going	 on,	 and	 right	 now,	 she	 needed	 every	 bit	 of	 data possible	that	showed	she	was	an	upstanding	citizen	of	the	community.	Another</p>
<p class="calibre1">police	 record	 showing	 violence	 against	 a	 male	 might	 keep	 Jack	 Reagan	 from dropping	the	case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 she	 might	 just	 get	 her	 ass	 kicked	 by	 this	 son-of-a-bitch.	 	 He	 was	 only two	years	from	Earth,	and	even	if	he’d	never	been	to	a	gravity	clinic,	he’d	still have	 the	 bone	 density	 and	 strength	 to	 hurt	 her	 bad	 with	 a	 single	 punch.	 Bruno and	 Richard	 might	 have	 been	 bigger	 than	 this	 jerk,	 but	 she	 probably	 couldn’t even	slow	him	down	with	a	punch	twice	as	hard	as	what	she’d	used	to	kill	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 conference	 room	 door	 slammed	 open.	 “Okay,	 I	 want	 to	 see	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1">rebreather,”	Dr.	Smith	said,	as	she	burst	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Larry	looked	at	her.	“Hey,	Dr.	Smith,	we	could	probably	use	your	help.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Understatement	was	the	first	term	that	came	to	Pati’s	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Larry	 turned	 toward	 the	 rebreather	 and	 pointed.	 “It	 looks	 perfectly	 fine, except	we	did	get	higher	than	normal	CO2	levels	registered	in	the	database	when she	was	outside.	You	have	any	idea	why	that	would	happen?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">At	least	he	didn’t	have	an	attitude	about	it, </i>	Pati	thought.	She	saw	Dr.	Smith lean	over	and	grab	the	rebreather,	much	in	the	same	way	Larry	had,	and	just	like Pati	did	when	she	ran	her	checks	on	the	bus.	Dr.	Smith	ran	the	same	checks,	only</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>in	 backward	 order.	 She	 turned	 the	 rebreather	 over	 and	 pulled	 the	 straps	 and frame	 away	 from	 the	 apparatus,	 apparently	 examining	 the	 equipment	 from	 the opposite	 side.	 Then	 she	 pulled	 the	 whole	 apparatus	 off	 the	 pack	 and	 sat	 each piece,	still	connected,	on	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Smith	stood	back	from	the	table	and	stared	at	the	rebreather	components. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 rubbed	 her	 forehead	 with	 her	 left	 hand	 and	 then	 rubbed	 her	 chin	 with	 the same	hand.	She	reached	out	and	picked	up	the	rebreather	again,	this	time	placing the	 parts	 as	 if	 looking	 through	 the	 frame	 that	 held	 it	 and	 again	 rubbed	 her forehead	 and	 chin.	 She	 looked	 at	 Larry	 and	 shrugged	 her	 shoulders.	 Then	 she took	another	look	at	the	rebreather	and	pulled	pieces	apart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	took	her	twenty	minutes,	at	least.	Finally,	she	held	up	the	scrubber.	“This	is it,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	think	there’s	something	wrong	with	the	scrubber?”	Larry	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	 exactly,	 Larry.	 We	 have	 a	 nearly	 perfect	 process	 for	 recycling	 the scrubbers.	 Even	 if	 this	 one	 got	 through	 and	 the	 material	 wasn’t	 recycled,	 it should	still	work	better	than	the	CO2	numbers	you	saw.”	She	paused.	“As	long</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	the	airflow	is	in	the	right	direction.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 arrow	 pointed	 in	 the	 right	 direction,”	 Pati	 said.	 “I	 checked	 it	 at	 least twice	before	I	went	outside,	and	I	looked	at	it	a	hundred	times	after	the	rescue vehicle	picked	me	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 handed	 the	 scrubber	 to	 Larry.	 “Look	 closely	 at	 the	 arrow	 and	 then	 the fittings,”	she	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	took	the	scrubber	in	his	thick,	hairy	right	hand.	He	squinted	hard,	and	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">less	 than	 a	 second,	 his	 eyes	 went	 wide	 in	 surprise.	 He	 unscrewed	 a	 connective piece	from	the	inlet	and	then	checked	the	inlet.	“Oh,	crap.	Lynch,	I	probably	owe you	an	apology,”	he	said,	while	he	continued	to	examine	the	scrubber. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr.	Smith	took	the	scrubber	from	Larry’s	hand.	She	held	it	up	to	Pati.	“Look</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	the	flares	on	the	arrow,	see	how	the	color	is	slightly	different?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	noticed,	and	she	looked	at	the	other	end	of	the	arrow	and	saw	the	barely</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognizable	scratch	marks	that	were	where	flares	used	to	be.	“What	happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Larry	 and	 Dr.	 Smith	 looked	 at	 each	 other,	 then	 Dr.	 Smith	 turned	 to	 her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Somebody	modified	the	arrow	on	the	scrubber	so	it	could	be	put	in	backward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	 an	 extreme	 process	 used	 to	 quality	 control	 the	 recycling	 of	 these scrubbers,	but	it’s	not	proof	against	purposeful	tampering.”	She	looked	at	Larry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	there	any	reason	why	this	should	wind	up	on	her	rebreather?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Larry	shook	his	head.	“We	just	hand	them	out	based	on	availability.	I’ll	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	the	name	of	whoever	handed	it	to	her,	just	remember	they	were	not	the	one</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>who	placed	that	scrubber	on	that	particular	rebreather.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	we	need	to	call	a	constable,”	Dr.	Smith	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	we	need	to	do	that.	If	one	of	my	workers	did	that,	I	want	them	rotting</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	a	jail	cell	on	the	way	back	to	Earth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait,”	Pati	said.	“You	think	someone	tried	to	kill	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither	Larry	nor	Dr.	Smith	seemed	to	want	to	answer	that	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 couldn’t	 believe	 they	 wanted	 her	 back	 to	 work	 at	 the	 usual	 time.	 She	 just spent	the	evening	talking	to	constables	about	her	sabotaged	rebreather,	and	they seemed	to	be	in	no	hurry	to	finish	or	let	her	go.	They	continued	to	press	on	and on	 about	 who	 might	 want	 to	 see	 her	 dead.	 Pati	 had	 no	 shortage	 of	 possibilities since	 the	 tragic	 event	 on	 the	 ice-mining	 ship,	 or	 the	 accidental	 death	 of	 her husband,	and	the	more	they	pressed,	the	more	she	had	answers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 list	 of	 suspects	 was	 not	 encouraging.	 Pati	 read	 through	 it	 and	 didn’t know	most	of	the	people	on	the	list,	only	that	they	worked	for	a	McLear,	or	were related	to	Bruno	Redden,	or	were	friends	with	the	twins.	It	redoubled	her	desire to	get	off	of	Titan	the	first	possible	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	to	wait	thirty	minutes	for	the	trolley	when	she	finally	got	to	leave	at the	late	hour.	She	walked	from	the	station	to	her	apartment	complex.	The	robot at	the	desk	let	her	in	on	sight,	and	she	tramped	her	way	to	her	apartment	upstairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	in,	she	marched	through	the	blue-carpeted	and	yellow-walled	living	room, </p>
<p class="calibre1">had	a	quick	meal	in	the	kitchenette,	and	went	straight	to	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 bedroom	 had	 the	 same	 color	 scheme	 as	 the	 living	 room,	 and	 only	 the white	 linens	 on	 her	 bed	 distinguished	 it	 from	 the	 living	 room	 with	 red	 leather furniture.	 She	 walked	 to	 the	 closet,	 dropped	 her	 work	 clothes	 into	 the	 laundry shoot,	and	threw	on	a	soft	t-shirt	with	shorts.	They	were	her	underclothes	from the	prison	ship,	and	she	would	have	trashed	them	if	they	weren’t	so	comfortable and	easy	to	sleep	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	even	a	bathroom	break,	she	slipped	into	bed.	She	fumed	about	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">jerks	 the	 constables	 were	 and	 then	 stopped	 her	 train	 of	 thought.	 If	 she	 would sleep	at	all,	she	couldn’t	afford	to	think	about	all	the	wrongs	she’d	experienced since	moving	to	Titan.	It	would	keep	her	up	for	weeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	instead	thought	about	what	it	would	be	like	when	she	got	back	to	Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>The	 wonderful	 thoughts	 relaxed	 her.	 She	 nodded	 off.	 She	 was	 no	 longer	 on Titan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	back	at	the	docks,	at	her	hometown	of	Dingle.	It	seemed	a	cloudy</p>
<p class="calibre1">day,	so	cloudy	that	she	didn’t	notice	any	color,	other	than	some	green	here	and there,	which	was	normal	for	Ireland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	docks	were	empty,	no	boats	anywhere,	and	no	people.	This	was	not	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 was	 used	 to.	 Her	 father	 and	 brothers	 fished	 in	 the	 old	 style,	 and	 she	 spent much	of	her	childhood	walking	down	to	see	them	after	school.	She	felt	a	tinge	of guilt	 dismissing	 their	 efforts	 as	 “backward”	 when	 she	 became	 a	 teenager	 and, unfortunately,	that	kind	of	thinking	led	her	to	the	other	place,	which	she	couldn’t quite	recall	at	the	moment.	Before	she	could	put	much	thought	into	the	subject, she	saw	a	person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stood	by	the	boat	ramp	on	Pati’s	left.	Pati	took	two	steps	in	her	direction, and	then	she	was	in	front	of	her.	“Hello,	Patricia,”	the	little	girl	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 little	 girl	 was	 maybe	 eight.	 She	 wore	 a	 traditional	 Catholic	 school uniform	with	a	green-gray	tartan	design.	“Who	are	you?”	Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	little	girl	with	brownish-red	hair	replied,	“I’m	someone	very	important</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	you,	Patricia.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	from	my	family?”	Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl	slowly	shook	her	head	before	she	answered.	“Patricia,	I	can	be	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">important	to	you	than	your	family.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	give	you	what	you	want.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	I	want?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	 me	 show	 you,”	 she	 said.	 She	 raised	 both	 her	 arms	 into	 the	 air	 and disappeared.	Then	the	sun	became	stronger.	Not	oppressive,	just	enough	for	Pati to	feel	the	heat	on	her	skin.	Surprisingly,	the	docks	remained	as	gray	as	before, but	the	sky	was	almost	blue,	and	she	could	see	the	sun	in	its	brilliant	yellow.	Pati felt	 warm,	 comfortable,	 and	 back	 where	 she	 belonged.	 The	 only	 problem	 was that	nagging	buzzer	sound,	which	wouldn’t	stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	opened	her	eyes.	The	time	to	wake	up	was	projected	on	the	ceiling,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	couldn’t	be	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	just	went	to	bed,”	she	said	to	herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a><b class="calibre2">6	Machine	Judge</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 had	 never	 seen	 a	 courtroom	 till	 she	 landed	 on	 Titan.	 And	 for	 some reason,	she	expected	most	courtrooms	on	Earth	looked	the	same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Except,	 there	 was	 nowhere	 for	 a	 judge	 to	 sit.	 Instead,	 there	 was	 a	 screen whose	primary	purpose	was	to	display	the	“score”	of	the	trial.	She	avoided	a	trial for	 Richard’s	 death	 because	 Keebler	 settled	 the	 case	 with	 them.	 This	 time,	 she had	to	deal	with	Jack	Reagan.	Nancy	said	he	was	reasonable,	but	Pati	had	seen</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing	to	make	her	agree.	He	seemed	like	a	tough	bastard	who	only	cared	about winning	 cases	 and	 putting	 people	 in	 jail,	 a	 metric	 she	 learned	 the	 prosecutors were	judged	on.	Too	bad	they	weren't	judged	on	getting	it	right.	Nancy	seemed</p>
<p class="calibre1">confident,	though,	and	Pati	didn’t	worry	too	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	stood	at	the	podium	in	front	of	the	screen,	facing	Pati,	the	prosecutors who	sat	to	Pati’s	right,	and	a	small	crowd	of	people	behind	her.	The	crowd	was here	 to	 watch	 a	 preliminary	 hearing	 of	 a	 trial	 that	 would	 not	 take	 place	 for	 a week,	if	at	all.	She	could	think	of	better	ways	to	waste	one’s	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 screen	 displayed	 the	 words	 “Defense	 Statements.”	 That	 meant	 Nancy completed	 uploading	 data	 and	 was	 ready	 to	 start	 the	 defense.	 In	 dramatic portrayals,	Pati	was	accustomed	to	the	prosecutors	leading.	In	today’s	hearing,	it didn’t	matter	because	the	score	was	calculated	regardless	of	who	went	first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	finished	uploading	preliminary	statements	for	the	defense,”	Nancy	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	room.	“We	still	need	to	conduct	an	inspection	of	the	mining	ship,	at	which time	 we	 can	 discuss	 our	 findings	 with	 the	 prosecution.”	 Nancy	 left	 the	 podium and	sat	down	next	to	Pati. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 Reagan	 stood	 up	 and	 took	 his	 turn	 up	 front.	 He	 uploaded	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">prosecutor’s	 information,	 which	 took	 about	 five	 minutes.	 He	 then	 stood	 at	 the podium	as	the	screen	displayed,	“Prosecutor’s	Statement.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 state	 does	 not,	 at	 this	 time,	 dispute	 the	 information	 provided	 by	 the defendant.	The	state	will	only	maintain	that	this	trial	is	far	from	complete.	And, given	 the	 gravity	 of	 the	 charges,	 must	 be	 followed	 to	 a	 complete	 conclusion which	 requires,	 no	 demands,	 admission	 of	 all	 pertinent	 facts	 no	 matter	 how difficult	those	facts	are	to	obtain.	The	murder	of	a	human	being,	let	alone	three, requires	 a	 complete	 and	 comprehensive	 investigation.	 The	 defendant	 has	 a previous	 record	 of	 deadly	 assault,	 and	 to	 dismiss	 this	 case	 at	 this	 time	 is unacceptable.	 Even	 to	 put	 a	 time	 limit	 on	 the	 trial	 could	 easily	 prevent	 justice being	done.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>“Is	he	always	this	long-winded?”	Pati	whispered	to	Nancy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	I	wish	the	JJ	would	get	bored	with	him	and	give	more	points	in	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">favor,”	Nancy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five	 minutes	 later,	 Jack	 Reagan	 left	 the	 podium.	 The	 screen	 flashed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Opening	 Statements	 Complete?”	 Nancy	 and	 Jack	 both	 replied,	 “Yes,”	 at	 the same	time.	The	screen	went	blank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	let’s	see	what	we	get,”	Nancy	whispered	to	Pati. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	much	as	Pati	wanted	the	trial	to	be	finished,	at	the	moment,	she	was	glad</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	 was	 preliminary.	 The	 machine	 rendering	 the	 judgment	 over	 her	 could	 do anything	 at	 the	 moment.	 The	 score	 would	 be	 from	 one	 to	 a	 hundred.	 While realistically,	the	score	would	not	be	at	either	of	those	extremes,	anything	could still	happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	it	came	back	in	single	digits,	that	would	be	the	end.	Jack	Reagan	would	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken	out	of	the	decision,	and	Pati	would	have	to	be	released.	Despite	this	being a	 preliminary	 judgment,	 it	 would	 become	 binding	 since	 the	 accused	 had	 a stronger	right	to	their	freedom	than	the	state	had	to	incarcerate,	to	use	Nancy’s words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 the	 flip	 side,	 a	 score	 over	 ninety,	 and	 Pati	 would	 return	 to	 her	 cell	 and wait	 for	 the	 final	 judgment.	 The	 reason	 to	 detain	 her	 was	 that	 historically	 the accused	 was	 expected	 to	 be	 sentenced	 to	 a	 long	 trip	 back	 to	 Earth	 and	 likely would	become	scarce	before	the	final	judgment.	Pati	wouldn’t	think	twice	about going	into	hiding	if	that	happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 score	 between	 meant	 both	 sides	 had	 more	 work	 to	 do.	 Either	 obtain additional	 evidence	 to	 strengthen	 their	 case,	 or	 settle,	 or	 both.	 The	 bottom	 line being	this	preliminary	judgment	was	an	official	statement	on	where	the	case	was at	 with,	 for	 the	 first	 time,	 both	 sides	 presenting	 evidence	 and	 arguments—the result	providing	direction	on	how	to	proceed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 screen	 had	 not	 changed	 in	 the	 last	 minute,	 and	 Pati	 clenched	 her	 fists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 crowd	 had	 gone	 quiet,	 although	 a	 few	 voices	 were	 heard.	 Bailiffs	 were around	the	room,	carrying	tranquilizer	guns	like	the	ones	the	constables	carried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	protected	the	door,	and	another	two	stood	equidistant	from	the	podium.	Pati felt	the	security	was	a	bit	overkill	for	a	preliminary	hearing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There,”	Nancy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	saw	the	screen	display	a	35. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Noooo!”	a	lady	screeched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	turned	and	saw	a	middle-aged,	red-headed	lady	standing.	She	looked	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati,	 and	 the	 look	 was	 someone	 who	 wanted	 to	 kill.	 Then,	 her	 body	 language softened,	 and	 she	 looked	 at	 the	 ground.	 “She	 killed	 my	 baby,”	 she	 whimpered out	loud. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>Pati	turned	back	to	look	at	Nancy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	Bruno	Redden’s	family	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	looked	again	and	saw	individuals	who	were	probably	a	father,	a	brother, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a	brother’s	wife,	and	maybe	a	sister.	Nobody	looked	at	Pati	with	sympathy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	get	back	to	my	office	and	discuss.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	didn’t	need	to	be	told	twice.	She	followed	Nancy	out	of	the	courtroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	believe	that	was	a	good	score?”	Pati	said.	They	were	back	in	her	office.	Nancy sat	behind	her	desk	and	Pati	across	from	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 the	 score	 wasn’t	 enough	 to	 get	 you	 released	 immediately,	 but	 it’s better	than	I	hoped	for	at	this	stage	of	the	trial.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 also	 hoped,	 although	 she	 had	 more	 than	 one	 desire.	 “Okay,	 so,	 what’s my	chances	of	making	it	back	to	Earth	soon?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	the	only	answer	I	can	give	you	is	how	much	longer	the	trial	will	last, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	that	depends	on	what	the	results	will	be.	Getting	back	to	Earth	is	up	to	you, although	if	we	get	a	positive	result	in	the	trial,	it	won’t	be	long	before	you’re	on your	way.	Should	you	still	choose	to	leave.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 nodded,	 no	 need	 to	 tell	 Nancy	 her	 chances	 of	 staying	 were	 zero.	 “All right	then,”	she	said,	“what	do	we	do	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	keep	looking	for	data	that	supports	your	statements,	which	is	why	we’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">inspect	the	mining	ship	tomorrow,	looking	for	more	evidence.	The	score	the	JJ</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	back	with	tells	me	that	the	prosecutor	is	living	on	rhetoric.	The	only	reason he	 wants	 to	 keep	 the	 trial	 going	 is	 he	 hopes	 more	 incriminating	 evidence becomes	 available,	 and	 he	 thinks	 there	 should	 be	 no	 time	 limit.	 Except	 it’s	 not his	call,	and	the	JJ	has	programs	to	determine	how	long	it	can	go	before	calling	it quits.	 If	 the	 engineer	 can’t	 restore	 the	 mining	 ship	 records	 Jack	 Reagan	 is banking	 on,	 the	 JJ	 goes	 with	 your	 statement	 and	 any	 evidence	 that	 supports	 or contradicts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	he	can’t	do	anything	about	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	not	at	all.	The	JJ	works	without	emotion,	which	generally	hurts	public</p>
<p class="calibre1">defendants	more	than	prosecutors.	We’re	just	lucky	this	time	the	rules	favor	your case.	I	could	never	see	Jack	breaking	down	in	tears	in	order	to	get	a	conviction, but	I	have	seen	him	play	the	victim’s	fiddle	to	try	to	push	up	a	score.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>“That’s	why	Bruno’s	family	was	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Another	 reason	 why	 I’m	 glad	 we’re	 working	 with	 a	 JJ	 and	 not	 on	 Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 scream	 would	 sink	 you	 if	 there	 was	 a	 jury.	 The	 JJ	 doesn’t	 even	 pay attention	to	statements	in	the	courtroom.	Unless	you	or	I	make	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 tried	 hard	 not	 to	 feel	 remorse	 over	 Bruno,	 even	 though	 there	 was	 no reason	for	Pati	to	doubt	her	actions.	Bruno	attacked	her,	and	he	had	a	chance	to stop	 more	 than	 once.	 They	 were	 in	 an	 emergency	 situation,	 she	 was	 in	 charge, and	he	attacked	her.	He	got	what	was	coming,	and	the	only	thing	she	wished	was the	 recordings	 still	 existed	 so	 everyone	 would	 know	 what	 happened.	 Still,	 she couldn’t	help	but	feel	a	little	sympathy	for	his	mother.	“You’d	think	his	family would	accept	that	Bruno	stepped	out	of	line,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pati,	 when	 it	 comes	 to	 tragedy,	 people	 always	 look	 for	 someone	 to	 blame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	 if	 we	 had	 the	 video	 showing	 he	 attacked	 you,	 they’d	 still	 want	 to	 find	 a reason	to	show	it	was	your	fault	or	that	you	lured	him	into	those	actions.	Try	not to	worry	about	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	I	won’t.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	sat	back	and	stared	at	the	ceiling.	“Even	though	we	had	a	good	score, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a	score	I’d	take	without	thinking	if	it	was	the	final	ruling,	it’s	time	to	pour	on	the heat.”	Nancy	looked	at	Pati.	“I	want	to	get	it	even	lower	in	the	next	hearing.	We need	to	put	Jack	Reagan	in	a	position	where	if	he	continues	the	trial,	he'll	lose his	license	to	practice	law.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that	so	important?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	leverage	we	have	to	use,	Pati.	The	prosecutors	have	unlimited	funds	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	what	they	do.	If	they	waste	resources	just	because	they	want	to	put	a	hurt	on somebody	they	can’t	convict,	then	there	needs	to	be	consequences.	Jack	Reagan, bulldog	 personality	 and	 all,	 has	 to	 follow	 all	 of	 those	 rules,	 and	 I	 think	 if	 we push	 the	 score	 down,	 he’ll	 cut	 his	 losses.”	 She	 smiled.	 “Or	 maybe	 even	 accept you’re	innocent	of	the	charges,	who	knows?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	nodded.	They	should	do	anything	if	it	helped	her	case.	Three	men	tried</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	kill	her,	and	each	time	they	died	because	she	defended	herself.	Now	she	was on	 trial	 for	 their	 murder.	 The	 only	 correct	 result	 was	 to	 clear	 her	 of	 those charges.	 Who	 cared	 how	 it	 happened,	 or	 if	 a	 lawyer	 had	 his	 career	 damaged trying	to	stop	it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	 meet	 you	 at	 the	 Grand	 Center	 tomorrow,	 and	 we’ll	 go	 down	 to	 the spaceport	to	see	your	mining	ship,”	Nancy	said.	“We’ll	then—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 thought	 they	 won’t	 let	 me	 near	 the	 docks	 with	 my	 ankle	 bracelet,”	 Pati said.	She	hadn’t	thought	of	that	restriction	when	Nancy	mentioned	it	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ll	let	you	for	this.	Besides,	I	need	you	to	show	me	around.	You	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">living	on	that	tub	for	three	months,	and	you’re	the	only	source	of	information	on</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>what	happened,	so	it’s	a	task	we	have	to	do.”	She	leaned	forward.	“You’ll	be	up to	 it,	 won’t	 you?	 I	 mean,	 you	 won’t	 have	 any	 problems	 going	 back	 there,	 will you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	 problems	 at	 all,”	 she	 said.	 Pati	 didn’t	 even	 think	 about	 her	 answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unless	 Bruno	 or	 the	 twin’s	 ghosts	 were	 there	 waiting	 for	 her,	 a	 possibility	 she could	 only	 laugh	 at,	 she	 would	 have	 no	 problem	 walking	 back	 onto	 her	 ship again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	again,	she	did	see	Richard’s	ghost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Why	am	I	back	in	Dingle	again?	Pati	asked.	She	was	back	at	the	docks	and	saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">old	 folks	 walking	 down	 to	 the	 water.	 Or	 did	 they	 walk	 out	 of	 the	 water?	 She couldn’t	tell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	as	gray	as	last	time,	and	the	buildings	were	as	dreary.	Even	the	yellow buildings	reminded	her	more	of	butter	than	the	bright	sun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	back,”	a	young	voice	said	behind	her.	Pati	turned	to	see	the	young	girl</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	are	you?”	Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	doing	well.	Do	you	still	want	us	to	give	you	what	you	desire?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	I	desire?”	Pati	wasn’t	certain	what	she	was	expected	to	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	everyone	wants.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	confused	Pati.	She	didn’t	believe	all	people	desired	the	same	thing.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew,	 living	 in	 Dingle,	 she	 only	 wanted	 to	 live	 somewhere	 else.	 At	 the	 other place,	she	only	wanted	to	leave	as	well.	She	never	understood	where	she	wanted to	 be.	 She	 always	 thought	 she	 knew,	 yet	 the	 experience	 of	 being	 where	 she wanted	to	be	never	seemed	quite	the	same.	Did	this	girl	know	where	Pati	desired to	be? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	do	I	want	to	go?”	Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	want	to	go	anywhere,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 really	 didn’t	 understand.	 Okay,	 she	 was	 in	 Dingle,	 or	 was	 it	 really Dingle?	“Do	I	desire	to	stay	in	Dingle,	or	just	return	there?”	Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	not	in	Dingle.	Watch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 watched,	 and	 the	 next	 moment	 she	 was	 orbiting	 Saturn	 like	 in	 the mining	ship.	Again,	the	colors	were	grayish	with	lots	of	shades,	more	so	than	in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a>Dingle.	 She	 remembered	 watching	 the	 same	 view	 from	 monitors	 in	 the	 mining ship,	except	now	it	was	a	panoramic	view	in	three-dimensions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 don’t	 travel	 here	 unless	 we	 are	 required,”	 the	 girl	 said,	 without	 being seen.	 In	 fact,	 Pati	 couldn’t	 see	 herself	 at	 the	 moment;	 she	 just	 experienced	 the view	traveling	around	Saturn.	Then,	up	ahead,	she	saw	Titan	approach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	our	home	since	we	came	to	this	galaxy,”	the	girl	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	could	see	Xanadu	and	identify	where	Karakorum	would	be	if	not	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">clouds.	She	continued	toward	Titan	as	if	watching	a	video.	She	penetrated	to	the interior,	 and	 the	 next	 moment,	 she	 existed	 inside	 a	 cavern	 that	 resembled	 the interior	of	a	massive	cathedral	on	Earth.	Except	the	color	was	gold,	a	golden-red that	 glowed.	 She	 examined	 the	 scene,	 and	 she	 saw	 more	 of	 that	 glow,	 or	 more precisely,	objects	that	glowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	like	Richard,	or	what	she	saw	Richard	to	be	on	the	mining	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hundreds,	no,	there	must	have	been	thousands	floating	in	the	cavern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	felt	warmth,	goodness,	and	peace.	They	didn’t	communicate	in	words,	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	any	other	human	method.	They	somehow	could	share	their	emotions	with	her, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	it	was	simple	ecstasy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 is	 what	 you	 desire,”	 the	 little	 girl	 said.	 The	 little	 girl	 was	 still	 only	 a voice	in	her	head.	Pati	suspected	she	was	one	of	the	apparitions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	am,	we	all	are,	and	we’re	waiting	for	you,”	the	little	girl	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	made	sense.	If	she	could	transport	Pati	all	this	way,	the	little	girl	was	not	a little	girl.	Pati	reviewed	the	scene,	having	no	desire	other	than	to	relax	in	these feelings.	 She	 had	 questions,	 as	 well.	 Could	 this	 be	 heaven?	 Was	 she	 no	 longer alive?	For	the	moment,	the	answers	were	immaterial.	The	only	problem	with	this environment	was	the	buzzing	noise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 buzzing	 noise	 that	 woke	 her	 up,	 and	 she	 saw	 the	 time	 projected	 onto	 the ceiling.	 “Damn,”	 she	 muttered.	 The	 dream	 was	 so	 wonderful,	 it	 gave	 her withdrawals	just	to	wake	up.	She	never	had	such	a	powerful	dream;	it	couldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	real,	though. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	pushed	the	covers	off	and	rolled	off	the	bed.	She	had	her	meeting	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 in	 a	 couple	 of	 hours.	 As	 much	 as	 she	 wanted	 to	 go	 back	 to	 bed,	 and maybe	re-experience	what	she	just	felt,	she	wanted	to	stay	out	of	jail	first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a>Pati	 had	 to	 admit,	 it	 was	 grand.	 She	 stared	 up	 into	 a	 scene	 where	 Saturn dominated	 the	 daytime	 sky,	 and	 the	 sun	 could	 be	 seen	 right	 behind	 it.	 The builders	of	Karakorum	built	a	perfectly	transparent	ceiling	for	this	regular	event. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Never	in	her	life	had	she	seen	such	a	sight	before	she	arrived.	It	was	the	view	of a	 lifetime	 she	 got	 to	 see	 every	 other	 week,	 weather	 permitting,	 which	 wasn’t normally	the	case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 was	 probably	 why	 they	 named	 this	 the	 Grand	 Center.	 When	 tourists came	to	Titan,	it	was	normally	on	their	to-see	lists.	Pati	liked	it	for	shopping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	sat	at	an	open-air	table,	eating	her	oriental	food,	and	researching	return trips	with	the	display	that	sat	on	the	table.	There	were	maybe	a	hundred	four-seat tables	 in	 this	 area,	 meant	 to	 seat	 various	 inhabitants	 of	 Karakorum	 during	 their lunch	hour.	It	was	late	breakfast	now,	and	it	wasn’t	so	crowded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike	 on	 Earth,	 the	 tables	 were	 secured	 to	 the	 floor	 because	 of	 the	 low gravity	and	the	need	to	keep	the	aisles	open	for	serving	robots.	Like	Earth,	it	had the	 odor	 of	 a	 multi-restaurant	 eating	 area,	 and	 she	 could	 smell	 a	 potpourri	 of cooked	meats	and	vegetables. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 had	 ordered	 her	 meal	 from	 the	 display.	 A	 few	 minutes	 later,	 a	 robot rolled	out	to	deliver	it.	It	gave	her	time	to	enjoy	the	view	of	Saturn	and	research her	return	trip	to	Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	you	are,”	Nancy	said,	from	behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	had	her	mouth	full	of	food;	she	turned	around	anyway	and	waved	Nancy</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	sit	down	across	from	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	let	you	eat,”	she	said,	after	taking	the	seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,”	Pati	responded,	after	swallowing	what	was	in	her	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	got	the	results	on	your	prison	clothes,”	Nancy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	did	you	find	out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 microscopic	 scans	 show	 abrasions	 exactly	 where	 you’d	 find	 them	 if you’d	struggled	with	Bruno.	Exactly	as	you	said	in	your	statement.	It’s	the	first physical	 evidence	 we	 have	 backing	 up	 your	 story.	 And,	 there’s	 no	 physical evidence	disputing	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Awesome,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 are	 you	 doing,	 besides	 eating?”	 Nancy	 asked.	 She	 pointed	 to	 the display	in	front	of	Pati. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 researching	 trips	 home,”	 Pati	 said.	 She	 pointed	 at	 the	 display,	 “I’m hoping	to	decide	soon	on	how	I’ll	leave	Titan.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	well,	that’s	looking	more	certain	now.	But,	we	still	have	lots	of	work</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	do	to	actually	make	certain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course.	I	imagine	we’re	still	going	down	to	the	spaceport.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	little	early,	but	there’s	no	reason	we	can’t	explore	some	when	we	get</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>there.	You	ready?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly,	 let’s	 go,”	 Pati	 said.	 She	 stood	 up	 from	 her	 chair,	 as	 did	 Nancy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 walked	 past	 Pati	 after	 a	 robot	 sped	 through	 with	 a	 covered	 dish.	 Pati followed	as	she	navigated	through	the	tables	and	out	through	a	bazaar	of	shops. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 section	 replicated	 the	 shops	 one	 would	 see	 at	 an	 old	 Caribbean	 seaport. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although,	the	workers	were	of	whatever	ethnic	group	that	needed	those	jobs	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	time	of	hire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	walking	past	more	shops	that	only	intensified	her	desire	to	escape	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Titan,	 they	 emerged	 onto	 Main	 Street.	 As	 the	 name	 implied,	 it	 was	 the	 main thoroughfare	in	Karakorum	and	ran	north	and	south.	It	was	thirty	meters	to	the other	side,	and	in-between	were	routes	for	groundcars,	static	walkways,	and	the trolleys.	Since	they	didn't	have	a	groundcar,	they	proceeded	to	the	Grand	Center Station	for	the	trolley	to	take	them	to	the	spaceport.	The	traffic	was	bad,	and	they had	a	time	avoiding	pedestrians	and	groundcars	heading	north. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	and	Pati	 stepped	around	the	 northbound	station	and	 on	the	walkway</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	 the	 trolley	 rails.	 The	 southbound	 station	 was	 on	 the	 other	 side,	 and	 they entered	through	the	sliding	glass	door.	Nancy,	and	then	Pati,	swiped	their	palms over	a	reader	in	a	kiosk	and	entered	the	boarding	area	through	separate	revolving doors.	Once	through,	they	met	on	the	metal	loading	platform. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike	the	steel-framed	building	they’d	walked	through,	the	platform	had	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">roof.	Pati	looked	up	through	the	transparent	ceiling	of	Grand	Center	again,	and Saturn	was	still	visible.	“Do	you	ever	tire	of	seeing	that?”	Pati	asked	Nancy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	looked	up.	“It’s	all	I	ever	knew.	You	lived	next	to	the	ocean	on	Earth, </p>
<p class="calibre1">what	was	that	like?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 sighed.	 “If	 it’s	 all	 you	 know,	 you	 think	 nothing	 about	 it.	 If	 you’re	 into blues	and	greens	my	home	is	the	most	beautiful	place	on	Earth.”	Pati	shrugged, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course,	that’s	not	something	you	appreciate	as	a	teenager	who	never	left	the place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	chuckled.	“Being	a	teenager	is	never	easy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	nodded	as	the	trolley	approached	from	their	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 trolley	 looked	 like	 a	 subway	 train	 with	 two	 cars,	 red	 paint,	 and	 a clanging	 bell	 as	 it	 slowed	 and	 approached.	 She	 admitted	 the	 designers	 at	 least tried	to	replicate	the	feel	of	nineteenth-century	public	transportation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	set	of	doors	slid	open	at	the	front	and	back	of	each	car,	and	the	pair	entered the	 back	 of	 the	 leading	 car.	 The	 doors	 slid	 closed	 behind	 them,	 and	 the	 cars slowly	accelerated.	The	trolley’s	top	speed	was	forty	kilometers	per	hour,	and	the driverless	vehicle	seemed	to	be	at	that	velocity	when	Pati	looked	out	to	the	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 seeing	 several	 administrative	 buildings,	 she	 saw	 the	 cross-streets	 and living	 complexes	 speed	 by.	 After	 another	 stop,	 they	 went	 by	 her	 old	 street.	 It</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>went	too	fast	for	her	to	see	her	house,	and	maybe	that	was	for	the	best.	Better	to just	keep	thinking	forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	private	factories	followed,	and	most	of	the	people	on	the	train	got	off	at the	station	there.	There	was	still	a	significant	number	of	passengers	as	the	trolley slowed	and	approached	the	south	terminus	station. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	 here,”	 Nancy	 said.	 Pati	 didn’t	 respond	 but	 followed	 Nancy	 out	 the sliding	 glass	 doors.	 They	 walked	 off	 the	 platform,	 following	 the	 crowd,	 and traversed	 the	 walkway	 to	 the	 terminal.	 Another	 set	 of	 sliding	 doors	 opened	 on their	 approach,	 and	 they	 entered	 a	 passenger	 terminal	 that	 became	 busy	 as	 the crowd	entered.	Nancy	led	her	over	the	gray	carpet	toward	blue	colored	stations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 an	 older	 man	 on	 the	 left	 rose	 to	 help	 them,	 she	 turned	 left	 and	 walked	 to	 a door	 on	 that	 side.	 She	 opened	 the	 door	 and	 walked	 through	 to	 an	 open-space office	area.	To	the	right	was	a	desk	with	Nancy’s	husband	sitting	behind	it.	He waved	her	over	when	Pati	entered	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	Nancy,”	he	said	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	up,”	she	responded	and	hugged	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	tell	Lani	that	you’re	here,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,	we’ll	wait.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 nodded	 and	 walked	 behind	 her	 to	 an	 office	 door,	 next	 to	 windows showing	that	office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	do	we	need	to	come	here?”	Pati	asked.	“Can’t	we	just	walk	out	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ship?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jack	Reagan	wants	to	have	us	escorted.	It’s	a	condition	of	letting	you	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	spaceport.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 sighed	 and	 looked	 back	 at	 Nancy’s	 husband.	 He	 left	 open	 the	 door	 he entered,	 and	 he	 talked	 to	 a	 darker-skin	 lady	 at	 a	 desk.	 She	 put	 a	 tablet	 down, stood	 up,	 and	 towered	 over	 him.	 She	 let	 him	 lead	 her	 back	 to	 his	 desk.	 They were	both	wearing	brown	pants	and	light	blue	shirts.	Lani	held	her	hand	out	to Nancy	as	she	walked	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Counselor,	it’s	good	to	see	you	again,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,	Lani.	You	know	to	call	me,	Nancy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	 sorry	 about	 the	 formality,	 but	 I	 know	 you’re	 on	 business.	 I	 didn’t want	to	be	unprofessional.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	worry	about	that.	We	have	a	lot	to	see,	and	we	need	your	help.	I’m	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	first-name	basis	with	everyone	I	work	with.	Even	some	of	those	I	work	against, so	you	needn’t	worry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lani	 smiled.	 Her	 dark	 skin	 surrounded	 Asian	 characteristics,	 although	 Pati couldn’t	tell	which	country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lani,	this	is	Pati	Lynch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>“Very	pleased	to	meet	you,	Pati,”	she	said,	holding	out	her	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you,	too,”	Pati	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 they	 shook	 hands,	 Nancy	 looked	 at	 Joe.	 “Honey,	 we’ll	 be	 okay	 with Lani.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	no	problem.	Lani’s	the	most	knowledgeable	stevedore	we	have	here.	If</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	can’t	answer	your	question,	nobody	can.”	He	turned	to	Lani.	“And	I’m	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">saying	that	to	get	a	better	rating	from	my	boss.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lani	and	Nancy	laughed.	Pati	wasn’t	certain	of	the	relationship,	so	she	held</p>
<p class="calibre1">back.	Joe	smiled	until	he	looked	at	Pati.	Then	he	turned	back	to	Nancy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I’ve	been	here	thirty	years,	so	I	should	have	some	knowledge,”	Lani</p>
<p class="calibre1">said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	still	hadn’t	gotten	used	to	people	on	Titan	looking	so	young.	If	Lani	had worked	 here	 for	 thirty	 years,	 she	 looked	 as	 if	 she	 started	 in	 kindergarten.	 No wrinkles	 in	 her	 face,	 or	 streaks	 of	 gray	 hair,	 and	 her	 eyes	 were	 as	 bright	 as	 a teenager’s.	 When	 Pati	 got	 back	 to	 Earth,	 there	 would	 be	 a	 time	 in	 her	 future where	she	regretted	leaving	Titan	and	its	low	gravity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	get	started	then,”	Nancy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lani	led	the	way	to	the	back	of	the	room.	They	walked	through	a	door	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	massive	steel	hangar	Pati	was	accustomed	to,	except	they	had	to	walk	by	all the	landers	and	shuttles	instead	of	going	straight	to	the	big	ships.	There	was	no shortage	of	these,	with	crowds	of	workers	waiting	to	board. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	the	second	wave	of	the	morning	rush,”	Lani	said	to	Nancy	and	Pati,	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">followed.	“Everyone	on	their	way	up	to	Picus.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	noticed	some	of	the	crowd	stared	at	her,	then	a	few	pointed.	She	tried	to walk	faster	and	was	next	to	Lani	as	she	moved	through	the	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	worry	about	it,	Pati,”	Nancy	said	when	they	exited	the	crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	won’t	stop	looking	at	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	won’t	be	for	long.”	Nancy	took	the	lead	with	Lani,	letting	Pati	trail	a	few steps	 behind.	 They	 traversed	 what	 turned	 into	 a	 road	 for	 support	 vehicles between	the	larger	space-going	vessels.	The	ceiling	was	fifty	meters	above	them, except	 the	 hangar’s	 dimensions	 were	 box-shape	 and	 not	 half-cylinder	 like	 the rest	 of	 Karakorum,	 and	 there	 was	 no	 sky	 of	 Earth	 projected	 on	 the	 ceiling.	 It made	for	a	cavernous	feel,	and	she	wondered	who	got	the	job	to	do	NDT	testing</p>
<p class="calibre1">outside	of	this	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right	there,”	Lani	said,	pointing	to	the	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	recognized	her	mining	ship,	and	the	marking	37-C	let	her	know	she	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">correct.	She	could	walk	straight	to	the	entry	hatch	and	enter.	Instead,	she	let	Lani lead	the	way,	not	knowing	if	she’d	mess	up	some	legal	issue	walking	where	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">shouldn’t. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a>Lani	tapped	the	code	pad	next	to	the	hatch,	and	the	door	opened	in	and	to	the left.	 Lani	 walked	 in,	 followed	 by	 Nancy	 and	 Pati.	 They	 walked	 through	 the tunnel	into	the	common	area	she’d	pulled	the	plug	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	told	the	twins	secured	themselves	with	clothing,	as	everything	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t	tied	down	was	swept	out	into	space.	All	it	got	them	was	a	state-sponsored funeral,	since	they	had	no	other	family,	only	each	other.	They	died	like	they	were born,	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	stepped	over	to	the	door	leading	to	her	room.	Instead	of	walking	in,	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaned	her	back	against	the	wall	next	to	it.	Pati	slumped	down	to	the	floor	and broke	down	in	tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	only	lied	when	she	told	Nancy	it	didn’t	bother	her.	As	bad	as	they	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">be,	 she	 really	 liked	 Jake	 and	 Jeff.	 They	 had	 nobody	 in	 the	 world	 except	 each other	 after	 their	 parents	 died.	 The	 poor	 boys	 were	 only	 ten	 or	 eleven	 then,	 old enough	 to	 have	 it	 hurt	 bad,	 too	 young	 to	 know	 how	 to	 deal	 with	 it.	 The	 foster parents	 they	 were	 given	 were	 no	 help,	 and	 the	 state	 they	 were	 wards	 of	 acted much	 like	 the	 state	 that	 was	 trying	 to	 put	 her	 in	 jail	 now.	 It’s	 no	 wonder	 they lived	a	life	of	crime.	Pati	wished	she	could	have	been	better	to	them.	There	were probably	times	when,	if	she	had	reached	out,	or	been	friendlier,	they	would	have trusted	 her	 after	 what	 she	 did	 to	 Bruno.	 They	 would	 all	 three	 be	 alive.	 And,	 if she	didn’t	have	witnesses	to	the	apparition	she	saw	and	talked	to	her,	she’d	have character	witnesses	that	Bruno	could	attack	his	boss	when	angry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	sat	down	next	to	Pati	and	put	her	arms	around	her.	She	let	Pati	lean</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	head	on	her	shoulder.	Lani	walked	into	what	was	Bruno’s	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	want	to	talk	about	it?”	Nancy	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 no,”	 Pati	 said	 as	 she	 lifted	 her	 head	 and	 wiped	 her	 eyes.	 “I’m	 just thinking	 about	 how	 things	 could	 have	 gone	 differently.	 The	 twins	 never	 had much	of	a	chance	in	life,	and	yes,	I	regret	what	I	did.	This	is	one	of	those	times when	I	wish	it	had	been	me	instead	of	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 hugged	 her	 and	 pulled	 her	 arm	 from	 Pati’s	 front,	 leaving	 the	 other over	 her	 shoulders.	 “I’d	 be	 surprised	 if	 you	 didn’t	 have	 any	 remorse.	 If	 I remember,	with	Richard	there	were	a	few	times	you	wished	you	just	held	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 was	 quite	 sorry	 for	 what	 you	 did.	 I	 know	 this	 time	 it’s	 been	 about	 doing what	you	had	to	do,	it	seems	to	have	affected	worse	though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	nodded,	it	wasn’t	exactly	the	same,	but	Nancy	got	the	idea	at	least. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	want	to	do	this	another	day?”	Nancy	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	Pati	said.	She	got	up,	and	Nancy	did	the	same.	They	both	brushed	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati’s	clothes,	and	then	Pati	brushed	off	the	back	of	Nancy’s	business	suit.	Lani walked	back	into	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	do	you	want	to	start?”	Lani	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>“Let’s	 get	 up	 to	 the	 bridge,”	 Nancy	 said.	 “That’s	 where	 the	 scene	 of	 our statement	will	be.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lani	 nodded	 and	 stepped	 up	 to	 the	 ladder	 in	 the	 center	 of	 the	 room.	 She climbed	four	meters	into	the	ceiling.	Pati	walked	over	and	started	up	next.	The climb	felt	unusual	because	her	usual	practice	was	to	bounce	from	the	floor	and use	the	ladder	as	a	guide	as	she	floated	up	in	zero	gravity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lani	 had	 cleared	 the	 landing	 when	 Pati	 climbed	 through	 to	 the	 bridge.	 Pati stepped	 back	 into	 what	 was	 her	 command	 area	 as	 Nancy	 climbed	 through.	 She scanned	around,	and	unlike	downstairs,	it	looked	exactly	as	she	had	left	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lani,	 could	 you	 go	 back	 down	 till	 I	 call	 for	 you?”	 Nancy	 asked.	 “This	 is one	of	those	professional	moments,	and	I	need	to	be	alone	with	my	client.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lani	didn’t	respond	and	descended	the	ladder.	Nancy	closed	the	hatch	behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	and	pulled	out	a	thin	device	that	just	fit	in	her	hand.	She	touched	a	button	on it	and	then	waived	for	Pati	to	come	closer.	“If	someone	has	bugged	the	area,	this will	scramble	the	sound	just	outside	our	personal	space.	We	don’t	want	anyone</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 hear	 what	 you	 say,	 even	 if	 it	 would	 be	 inadmissible	 to	 the	 JJ.”	 She	 held	 the scanner	over	her	head	and	then	looked	around.	“Pati,	I’d	like	you	to	examine	the area,	 and	 tell	 me	 more	 than	 what	 you’ve	 already	 told	 me.	 When	 I	 took	 your statement,	we	were	just	trying	to	get	your	version	of	what	happened.	This	time,	I want	 you	 to	 refer	 to	 anything	 you	 can	 think	 of	 and	 let	 the	 scene	 help	 your memory.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 complied.	 She	 reviewed	 landing	 on	 the	 iceberg	 that	 day,	 and	 how	 they remotely	hooked	heat-hoses	to	the	glaciers.	They	took	on	their	limit	for	a	single iceberg	 and	 jumped	 off	 to	 find	 another.	 That’s	 when	 life-support	 started	 going south.	 Everything	 happened	 so	 fast.	 So	 Pati	 did	 a	 slow	 360	 while	 Nancy continued	to	hold	the	jammer	over	their	heads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nancy,	 the	 only	 difference	 from	 my	 statement	 I	 can	 think	 of	 is	 the apparition.	I	know	you	don’t	want	to	bring	that	into	court,	but	I	saw	it	as	plain	as I	see	you	now,	and	it	floated	right	where	you’re	standing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	didn’t	lower	the	jammer.	“Okay,	tell	me	what	you	saw,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 pointed	 to	 her	 command	 station.	 “I	 was	 standing	 there	 when	 I	 saw	 a light	 reflect	 against	 my	 screen.	 It	 was	 a	 gold	 color,	 and	 I	 turned	 to	 look.	 For some	reason,	I	walked	to	it	and	stood	about	there.”	Pati	pointed	halfway	between them	and	the	command	station.	“It	addressed	me	as	Pati,	so	I	asked	who	it	was, even	though	the	voice	was	exactly	like	Richard’s.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	it	said	it	was	a	native	of	Titan,	I	think,	and	it	said	their	people	have	to have	 revenge,	 so	 it	 was	 going	 to	 kill	 me	 by	 shutting	 down	 the	 life-support.	 I asked	 about	 my	 crew,	 and	 it	 said	 it	 was	 regrettable	 they	 were	 involved	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a>something.	 Then	 it	 went	 away.	 Bruno	 obviously	 believed	 the	 thing,	 because that’s	when	he	tried	to	kill	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	rubbed	her	chin	with	the	left	hand,	while	her	right	continued	to	hold</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	jammer	up.	“Well,	we	went	through	your	struggle	with	Mr.	Redden.	And	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">told	us	about	the	twins	seeing	you	at	some	point.	Was	there	anything	else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	think	I’ve	told	you	everything	now,	as	far	as	I	can	remember.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	brought	the	jammer	down	and	turned	it	off.	“I	have	to	hold	it	above	us</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	we	can	hear	each	other.	Kind	of	like	a	cone	of	silence,	except	you	can’t	see the	cone.”	Nancy	tapped	on	the	hatch	with	her	right	foot,	and	the	hatch	rose	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lani,	you	can	come	up	now,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lani	climbed	the	ladder	and	stood	before	them.	“Anything	else	you	need	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">here?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	Nancy	replied.	“I	think	we’re	good	for	now.	We’ll	need	to	go	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	rest	of	the	ship	now,	but	I	don’t	expect	we’ll	need	any	more	private	time.	You want	to	lead	the	way?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lani	 nodded	 and	 started	 back	 down	 the	 ladder.	 Nancy	 motioned	 for	 Pati	 to go	 before	 her.	 Pati	 started	 down	 the	 ladder,	 having	 trouble	 even	 in	 one-sixth gravity.	When	she	dropped	to	the	floor,	her	arms	felt	like	they’d	been	through	a workout. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	dropped	to	the	floor	last	and	turned	to	Lani.	“Okay,	Lani,	could	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">give	me	a	tour	of	this	ship?	I	know	Pati	could	tell	me	everything,	but	I’ve	been taxing	her	about	her	experience,	and	she	could	use	a	break.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	problem,”	Lani	said.	“Let’s	walk	out	to	the	storage	tanks,	to	begin	with. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’re	the	reason	for	having	these	ships.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	let	Lani	lead	the	way	again.	Pati	just	followed,	and	absolutely	agreed</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	Nancy:	she	could	use	a	break. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	had	received	a	call	and	needed	to	leave	early,	letting	Lani	finish	the	escort with	Pati	around	the	mining	ship.	Pati	didn’t	do	more	than	inspect	and	think	of anything	that	could	help	her	defense.	Unfortunately,	nothing	came	to	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Pati	finished,	she	told	Lani	she	was	done	for	the	day.	Lani	checked	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">watch	 and	 said	 that	 was	 good	 because	 it	 was	 time	 for	 her	 lunch.	 They	 left	 the mining	 ship	 and	 backtracked	 through	 the	 uncrowded	 hangar.	 They	 walked	 past</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>the	 administrative	 offices	 toward	 the	 door,	 Lani	 leading	 the	 way,	 and	 the	 door opened	on	their	approach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!	We	talk	about	it	now!”	Pati	heard	a	male	voice	scream	as	she	entered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 stood	 in	 front	 of	 Joe’s	 desk.	 About	 five	 other	 workers	 sat	 at	 theirs, watching	Joe	and	Nancy,	and	definitely	embarrassed	over	what	was	going	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lower	your	voice,	Joe,”	Nancy	hissed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	noticed	Lani	at	the	door,	at	least	that’s	what	it	looked	like	to	Pati.	Lani walked	 toward	 the	 pair.	 They	 heard	 Joe	 continue	 to	 talk,	 albeit	 in	 a	 lower volume.	“You’re	always	too	busy	to	talk	at	home.	You	never	try	and	see	me	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">discuss	anything.	What	the	hell	do	you	expect	me	to	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe,	 I’m	 busy	 right	 now	 and	 have	 to	 go	 make	 this	 appointment.	 You	 can believe	 we’ll	 discuss	 this	 when	 I	 get	 home,”	 Nancy	 said.	 Pati	 was	 still approaching	and	could	only	see	Nancy’s	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	count	on	me	being	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,”	 Nancy	 said.	 She	 turned,	 saw	 Pati,	 and	 motioned	 for	 her	 to	 follow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	did,	and	she	followed	her	straight	to	the	trolley	station	without	a	word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 didn’t	 know	 what	 to	 say.	 She’d	 hardly	 been	 married	 herself,	 and	 she wound	 up	 killing	 her	 husband.	 She	 was	 the	 last	 person	 to	 give	 marital	 advice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 she	 felt	 like	 she	 had	 to	 say	 something	 while	 they	 stood	 on	 the	 platform. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anything	else	you	want	from	me	today?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 exhaled	 and	 spoke	 while	 watching	 across	 the	 tracks,	 “Was	 there anything	else	you	noticed	while	you	toured	the	ship?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	couldn’t	think	of	anything.	But	it	helped	me	to	recall	the	events,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	might	be	something	I	think	of	later.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.	Keep	thinking	about	it	tonight.	Can	you	meet	me	tomorrow	morning, </p>
<p class="calibre1">around	 nine?	 We	 can	 discuss	 anything	 you	 might	 think	 of	 and	 prepare	 for	 the hearing	later	in	the	morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	got	nothing	else	to	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,	 I’m	 confident	 in	 your	 case,	 although	 only	 a	 fool	 would	 risk	 their freedom	and	not	try	to	move	events	more	to	their	favor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	 about	 you,	 are	 you	 okay?	 Do	 you	 need	 anything?”	 Pati	 asked.	 As much	as	she	wanted	to	stay	professional,	she	felt	some	sympathy	for	Nancy.	If</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	couldn’t	offer	good	advice,	an	offer	of	help	never	hurt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I’ve	got	to	take	care	of	this	on	my	own.	I	should	have	seen	it	coming</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	defused	the	situation	before	he	went	off.	He’s	normally	reasonable,	and	I	can fix	it	tonight,	or	later	if	he’s	serious	about	not	coming	home.”	Nancy	still	looked across	 the	 station	 as	 if	 in	 deep	 thought,	 maybe	 trying	 to	 focus	 on	 multiple problems,	which	Pati	never	could	do	well.	Pati	expected	tears	or	some	emotional response,	yet	Nancy	stood	there	like	a	rock. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>Nancy	looked	right,	which	was	due	to	the	trolley	arriving.	Pati	watched	as	it slowed	to	a	stop,	let	the	arriving	personnel	out,	and	then	opened	the	gates	for	the boarders.	Pati	led	the	way	this	time,	and	again	boarded	the	back	of	the	first	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	each	grabbed	a	vertical	pole	after	the	doors	shut	and	held	on	as	the	trolley accelerated.	 As	 selfish	 as	 Pati	 knew	 her	 thoughts	 to	 be,	 she	 couldn’t	 help	 but worry	that	Nancy’s	problems	at	home	could	hurt	her	case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 walked	 into	 her	 apartment	 and	 crashed	 on	 the	 couch.	 She	 had	 little	 to	 do after	the	ship	inspection,	and	had	stopped	by	the	clinic	for	a	gravity	treatment.	It was	a	little	soon	since	her	last	visit,	and	she	had	to	pay	for	it	herself;	however, she	expected	to	return	to	Earth,	and	every	bit	helped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 trolley	 ride	 back	 to	 her	 apartment	 was	 uneventful,	 and	 she	 had	 time	 to reflect	on	her	situation.	As	long	as	Nancy	kept	going,	Pati	thought	she’d	be	okay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	needed	to	ensure	there	would	be	no	problems	in	her	legal	representation,	and other	than	the	issue	with	her	husband,	Nancy	would	be	fine	for	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy’s	legal	firm	had	another	attorney	working	on	the	settlement	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">McLears.	Maybe	that	was	someone	Pati	should	visit,	just	to	network	a	bit.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t	 need	 to	 tell	 Nancy	 about	 it	 and	 wouldn’t	 have	 to	 apologize	 if	 she	 found out.	 All	 it	 would	 take	 was	 a	 message	 to	 that	 attorney	 to	 arrange	 a	 meeting.	 Of course,	Pati	would	have	to	find	out	his	or	her	name	first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Recent	 messages,”	 Pati	 announced	 to	 the	 room.	 The	 screen	 to	 her	 front engaged	 with	 a	 listing	 of	 recent	 messages	 received.	 Only	 a	 single	 message	 had arrived	since	the	morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Play	message,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 screen	 activated	 and	 displayed	 a	 small	 crowd	 of	 people.	 Her	 heart dropped	 when	 she	 saw	 the	 people,	 and	 a	 sign	 saying,	 “Pati,	 we	 miss	 you.”	 It brought	an	immediate	tear	to	her	eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey	Pati,	we	all	wanted	to	say	hello,”	her	mother	said,	from	the	left	side	of the	crowd.	She	saw	most	of	her	family	there	and	her	dad	on	the	other	side	of	her mother.	 In	 between,	 she	 saw	 her	 two	 older	 brothers	 with	 their	 wives.	 There was	 her	 older	 sister	 with	 her	 husband.	 And,	 in	 the	 lower	 row,	 her	 seven	 nieces and	nephews	that	weren’t	being	held	by	their	moms.	Behind	them	was	the	house</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 grew	 up	 in,	 and	 the	 grass	 looked	 as	 green	 as	 ever.	 And	 somehow	 it	 was	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>sunny	day,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 got	 the	 message	 you	 were	 done	 working	 on	 Titan,	 but	 ran	 into	 some difficulties,”	her	mom	continued.	“We	wanted	to	send	you	this	to	cheer	you	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone’s	 doing	 well.	 Your	 Dad’s	 going	 to	 retire	 from	 fishing	 next	 year, although	 I	 think	 he’s	 already	 retired	 from	 working	 around	 the	 house.”	 She	 saw her	Dad	grimace	as	if	struck	by	a	blow,	and	then	smile	as	if	he’d	caught	a	canary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tom’s	got	a	new	job	in	information	systems,	and	Kevin	bought	a	pub	down	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	water,	so	we’ve	a	good	place	to	take	you	when	you	get	home.	Sarah	finished medical	school	and	is	working	in	Killarney	for	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Other	than	her	Dad	retiring,	she	already	knew	most	of	what	her	brothers	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sister	 were	 doing	 with	 their	 lives.	 Most	 of	 that	 information	 was	 from	 mail messages,	though,	and	it	took	on	a	stronger	meaning	hearing	it	from	her	mom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 since	 you’ve	 been	 gone,	 we’ve	 a	 few	 additions	 to	 the	 family.”	 Her mom	 walked	 over	 to	 the	 tallest	 child.	 He	 was	 a	 boy	 about	 twelve,	 which	 Pati knew	 for	 certain	 because	 that	 was	 definitely	 Tom’s	 son,	 Michael.	 Next	 to	 him was	 Kevin’s	 girl,	 Maureen,	 about	 eleven.	 Then	 there	 were	 Tom’s	 twins,	 Cathy and	 Christine,	 both	 five	 years	 old,	 and	 almost	 as	 cute	 as	 when	 they	 were	 two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 hardest	 part	 about	 leaving	 Earth	 was	 Christine	 wouldn't	 let	 her	 go	 when everyone	 saw	 her	 off	 at	 the	 Shannon	 spaceport.	 Did	 Christine	 even	 remember her? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	this	is	Kevin’s	oldest	son,	Kevin.	You	remember	he	was	an	infant	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 left.	 And	 this	 is	 Sarah’s	 boy,	 Rhett,	 the	 one	 born	 when	 you	 were	 on	 your way	 to	 Saturn.	 And	 this	 is	 Kevin’s	 daughter,	 Shelly,	 she	 was	 born,	 if	 you remember,	right	after	you	got	married.”	Her	mom	stopped	for	a	second,	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	 and	 wiped	 her	 eyes.	 She	 looked	 back	 at	 the	 camera.	 “I’m	 still	 sorry everyone	couldn’t	be	there	for	the	wedding.	I	know	the	McLears	were	willing	to pay	for	the	trip,	but	not	all	of	us	could	afford	to	leave	Ireland	for	a	whole	year.	I know	you	thought	you	were	doing	the	right	thing	when	you	left,	and,	well,	at	the time	we	agreed	with	you.	Anyway…	here’s	some	new	additions	back	here.	Josie, </p>
<p class="calibre1">come	here.”	Tom’s	wife	walked	up	with	Jeffery,	his	not	quite	one-year-old	son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati’s	mom	took	him,	and	then	reached	over	to	Laura,	Kevin’s	wife,	and	took	the three-month-old	Rachael	in	her	other	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here’s	 Jeffery	 and	 Rachael;	 we’re	 hoping	 they	 won’t	 be	 too	 much	 older when	 you	 get	 back	 to	 see	 them.	 They’re	 both	 big	 eaters,	 and	 will	 be	 much bigger,	except	I	think	they’ll	be	just	as	cute	as	they	are	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 mom	 gave	 the	 children	 back	 to	 their	 mothers.	 Her	 brothers	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">laughing	 and	 shaking	 their	 heads.	 Then	 everyone	 looked	 to	 their	 right,	 “Pati,	 I thought	I’d	include	someone	you	used	to	know.	Don’t	get	mad	at	him,	it	was	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">idea.”	She	waved	to	the	person	on	her	right	to	walk	into	the	camera	angle. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>Even	 after	 three	 years,	 Pati	 had	 no	 problem	 recognizing	 Jerry.	 Tall	 for	 an Earthling,	maybe	two-meters	full,	he	also	had	that	thick	head	of	black	hair	and blue	eyes.	Unlike	some	guys	his	age,	he	hadn’t	put	on	weight,	and	those	trousers fit	him	perfectly,	as	usual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 three	 years	 ago,	 she	 would	 have	 shut	 off	 the	 message.	 Her	 life	 since then	had	been	like	rolling	in	a	tumbling	drier,	and	any	hate	she	felt	toward	him had	dried	out	like	the	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi	 Pati,”	 he	 said.	 “It’s	 been	 a	 while.	 Just	 thought	 I’d	 tell	 you	 that	 if everything’s	good,	maybe	we	could	meet	up	when	you	get	back,	talk	about	old</p>
<p class="calibre1">times	and	stuff.	Anyway,	hope	you	have	a	good	trip,	here’s	your	mom	again.”	He stepped	out	of	the	camera	angle,	and	her	mom	stepped	forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 I	 don’t	 want	 to	 hit	 you	 with	 a	 fire	 hose	 of	 emotions,	 Pati.	 I	 wanted everyone	 to	 let	 you	 know	 how	 much	 we	 miss	 you	 and	 we’re	 excited	 you’re coming	 back	 soon.	 If	 you	 need	 any	 help,	 don’t	 think	 it’s	 a	 bother.	 Love	 ya, goodbye.”	The	image	faded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	laid	down	on	the	couch,	putting	her	arm	over	her	eyes.	She	missed	them, </p>
<p class="calibre1">too,	and	the	video	was	what	she	needed.	Her	eyes	watered	while	she	also	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	the	people	in	her	life	who	would	do	anything	they	could	for	her,	just because	she	was	family.	Why’d	she	ever	leave? </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	would	immediately	respond	to	her	family.	She	would	not,	however,	send</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 video.	 There	 was	 no	 way	 she	 could	 make	 it	 all	 the	 way	 through	 a	 video message	without	breaking	down	and	sobbing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	arrived	at	Nancy’s	office	early	Friday	to	review	what	she	planned	to	do	in the	 JJ	 hearing	 later	 that	 morning.	 Pati	 sat	 opposite	 of	 Nancy,	 waiting	 on	 her	 to finish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	Pati,	here’s	the	data	I’m	putting	into	the	JJ	this	morning,”	Nancy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	video	screen	emerged	from	her	desk	and	rotated	into	Pati’s	field	of	vision.	Pati read	through	bullet	points	that	summarized	what	Nancy	would	upload	to	the	JJ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	documented	that	Bruno	attacked	Pati	with	intent	to	kill,	and	Pati	did	not	know why.	 The	 twins	 shut	 off	 life	 support	 to	 the	 bridge,	 and	 blocked	 any	 means	 of escape.	She	was	forced	to	pull	the	plug	because	her	life	support	was	failing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>Pati	 continued	 to	 stare	 at	 the	 screen.	 “I’m	 still	 not	 comfortable	 leaving	 out the	part	of	the	apparition.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	sighed.	“It	wouldn’t	be	a	good	idea	to	include	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	the	truth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	no	evidence	to	back	it	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	little	evidence	to	back	up	anything	I	said.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	let	me	put	it	this	way.”	Nancy	put	on	the	deadly	serious	look	Pati	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">learned	to	pay	attention	to.	“Everything	we	have	in	your	statement	is	plausible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	said	Bruno	attacked	you	and	tried	to	kill	you	for	no	reason	you	know	of.	His documented	history	makes	that	possible.	The	twins,	the	same	logic	applies.	This apparition	 you	 speak	 of,	 there	 is	 no	 documented,	 verifiable,	 instances	 of	 that happening,	anywhere,	ever.	Because	of	that,	the	JJ	will	give	next	to	no	weight	to the	assertion.	And	worse	of	all,	because	there	is	no	situation	the	JJ	will	relate	it to,	the	JJ	will	lessen	the	weight	of	the	rest	of	your	statement.	True	or	not,	without some	evidence	from	 a	separate,	reliable	 source	that	corresponds	 with	what	you assert,	 you’re	 better	 off	 not	 bringing	 it	 up.”	 She	 leaned	 back	 in	 her	 chair, apparently	waiting	for	Pati	to	respond. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	 been	 through	 everything	 that	 happened	 a	 thousand	 times	 in	 my	 head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And,	I	am	absolutely	sure	of	what	I	saw.	Could	we	even	consider	the	big	picture, that	I	have	been	contacted	by	an	alien	race,	one	that	apparently	can	take	over	a human?	While	I’m	very	concerned	about	what	happens	at	my	trial,	I	also	want	to know	what	humanity	wants	to	do	about	my	meeting	with	an	extraterrestrial.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	did	not	move	a	muscle.	Her	face	changed	not	in	the	least. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	believe	me,	do	you?”	Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 leaned	 forward.	 “Pati,	 I	 can	 believe	 something	 happened	 that	 leads you	 to	 believe	 you	 met	 a	 ghost	 or	 an	 apparition.	 But	 from	 a	 legal	 standpoint, none	of	that	matters.	We’re	here	today,	right	now,	to	make	sure	the	state	doesn’t send	 you	 back	 to	 Earth	 on	 a	 thirty-year	 trip.	 I	 believe	 you	 do	 not	 deserve	 that, nor	 most	 of	 the	 lesser	 punishments,	 either.	 Please,	 follow	 me	 in	 this.	 I’ve	 been here	 before	 and	 I	 know	 what	 needs	 to	 be	 done.	 You	 have	 a	 good	 case,	 and	 we only	 need	 to	 stick	 to	 our	 guns	 so	 you	 can	 walk	 away	 free.	 After	 that,	 you	 can work	 on	 the	 possibility	 that	 you	 interacted	 with	 an	 extraterrestrial.	 That's	 an alternative	you	won’t	have	if	you’re	on	a	mining	ship.”	She	sat	back	again.	“Or	a long	trip	back	to	Earth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	got	the	feeling	of	being	a	little	girl	chastised	by	an	adult.	But	Nancy	was absolutely	 right.	 She’d	 worked	 her	 butt	 off	 to	 keep	 Pati	 from	 spending	 a	 good part	 of	 her	 life	 in	 the	 state's	 custody.	 Now,	 her	 client	 wants	 to	 bring	 up	 what would	 be	 important	 to	 humanity	 based	 on	 a	 memory	 no	 living	 human	 has	 had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	would	not	deny	she	saw	something	that	looked	like	a	ghost	and	claimed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>be	 Richard.	 For	 now,	 she’d	 have	 to	 keep	 it	 to	 herself.	 If	 there	 were	 to	 be	 a meeting	 between	 humanity	 and	 extraterrestrials,	 that	 was	 for	 other	 people	 to worry	 about.	 “I	 see	 your	 point,”	 Pati	 said.	 “Just	 keep	 that	 information	 to myself?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Until	the	trial	is	over,	definitely.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right.	What	else	do	we	need	to	do	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 do	 you	 think	 of	 the	 data	 I’m	 uploading	 to	 the	 JJ?	 That	 was	 my original	question.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 thought	 about	 what	 she	 read.	 The	 statement	 didn't	 exactly	 portray	 how she	remembered	living	it.	At	the	same	time,	nothing	in	the	statement	was	wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	good,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	nodded.	“Fine,	Jack	Reagan	is	still	hot	and	heavy	on	this	case,	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">want	to	keep	on	the	offensive.	After	the	last	ruling,	he’s	not	in	a	good	position, and	if	we	can	get	a	better	ruling	this	time,	I	think	he’ll	start	to	crack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 nodded	 her	 head,	 too.	 Her	 only	 concern	 was,	 from	 what	 she’d	 seen	 of that	Jack	Reagan,	another	setback	wouldn't	scare	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Counselor,	 can	 I	 speak	 with	 you	 and	 your	 client	 now?”	 Jack	 Reagan	 asked Nancy.	They	were	in	the	courtroom,	and	the	JJ	just	returned	a	“29”	ruling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,	let’s	go,”	Nancy	said.	She	got	up	and	followed	Jack	Reagan	through	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">door	next	to	the	JJ	display	screen.	Pati	followed	her	and	emerged	into	a	hallway with	a	windowed	conference	room	on	the	left.	Jack	Reagan	walked	to	the	door</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	opened	the	lever	handle.	He	let	Nancy	and	Pati	walk	through.	Nancy	took	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">seat	next	to	the	head	spot,	and	Pati	sat	next	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 Reagan	 closed	 the	 door	 and	 took	 a	 seat	 across	 from	 them.	 He	 put	 his tablet	and	a	stylus	on	the	table.	“I	think	we	need	to	reach	a	settlement,”	he	said to	Nancy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	folded	her	arms.	“Well,	I	can’t	say	I	agree,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	why	is	that?”	Jack	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	score	of	29,	and	you	think	we	should	settle.	You	seem	to	believe	that	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	next	two	hearings,	that	score	won’t	go	any	lower.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	not	the	point,”	he	said.	“I	have	many	cases	that	I	can	put	more	of	the state’s	 resources	 toward	 if	 we	 finish	 this	 today.	 I	 will	 concede	 that	 Ms.	 Lynch</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>may	have	acted	in	self-defense	and	we	may	never	know	for	sure	what	happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	that	certainty,	however,	I’m	still	in	a	situation	where	people	have	been murdered,	and	there	must	be	some	restitution	to	the	state.	Because	the	murdered were	convicted	criminals	themselves	does	not	mean	I	can	ignore	their	fate	when choosing	a	sentence	for	the	perpetrator.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	stood	up	and	motioned	for	Pati	to	come	with	her.	“If	that’s	the	case, </p>
<p class="calibre1">then	 I	 don’t	 see	 why	 we’re	 here	 right	 now.”	 She	 led	 Pati	 around	 the	 table	 and toward	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Counselor,	please	sit	down.	I	don’t	plan	on	wasting	anyone’s	time,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	stopped	but	did	not	sit	down.	“Okay,	what’s	the	offer,	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 Reagan	 took	 a	 breath.	 “Six	 months	 on	 a	 mining	 ship,	 with	 at	 least twelve	weekends	of	leave,	spread	out	over	the	months.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Six	months!”	Nancy	spat.	“Did	I	miss	something?	Or	did	you	not	read	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">JJ	 score?	 There’s	 a	 reason	 that	 score	 went	 down,	 and	 it’s	 because	 all	 the evidence	 that	 has	 been	 discovered	 since	 then	 has	 supported	 my	 client’s testimony.	 And	 I	 have	 every	 expectation	 that	 trend	 will	 continue.”	 She	 nudged Pati	 to	 take	 her	 seat	 again	 and	 then	 did	 the	 same.	 She	 looked	 back	 at	 Jack Reagan.	“Unless	there’s	information	you’re	not	supplying.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	seemed	to	think	for	a	moment.	“No,	not	as	far	as	the	case	is	concerned, </p>
<p class="calibre1">although	the	engineers	are	still	working	on	the	records.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	what’s	the	information	that	doesn’t	concern	the	case?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	look	of	surprise	crossed	his	face.	“It	concerns	your	client.	May	I	first	ask	a question	of	her	before	I	reveal	this	information?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can	ask.	I	won’t	guarantee	an	answer,”	Nancy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,	Ms.	Lynch,	have	you	completed	your	travel	plans	back	to	Earth?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	not,	I’m	waiting	to	see	what	happens	with	the	trial.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	 did	 you	 plan	 on	 taking	 the	 two-year	 cruise?	 And	 I	 only	 ask	 because most	 people	 choose	 that	 and	 not	 because	 I	 have	 inside	 information	 on	 your plans.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	that’s	the	primary	choice	since	I	won’t	be	in	debt	when	I	return,	and	I can	work	to	pay	for	most	of	my	passage.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then,	 Nancy,	 have	 you	 discussed	 with	 your	 client	 any	 progress	 Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chevelde	has	made	in	negotiating	with	the	McLears?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	asked	him	to	only	report	to	us	if	he	needed	Ms.	Lynch’s	involvement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	wanted	us	to	focus	fully	on	dealing	with	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	may	I	state	what	I’ve	heard	on	good	authority.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does	it	pertain	to	this	case?”	Nancy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	pertains	to	Ms.	Lynch’s	situation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	ahead,	I’ll	stop	you	if	I	need	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>He	looked	at	Pati.	“It	seems	Kerry	McLear	is	willing	to	provide	a	significant sum	 if	 you	 renounce	 any	 claims	 to	 your	 ex-husband's	 assets.	 With	 that	 money, you	can	travel	back	to	Earth	on	whichever	ship	you	choose	and	cost	would	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	a	consideration.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 knew	 that	 would	 be	 a	 possibility.	 To	 hear	 it	 from	 another	 person, especially	an	officer	of	the	court,	launched	an	enthusiasm	rocket	within	her.	She wanted	to	dance;	she	wanted	to	sing.	She	wanted	off	this	damn	rock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	Ms.	Lynch,	you	could	probably	buy	and	sell	all	of	us	with	that	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">money.	However,	before	you	leave,	we	need	to	ensure	the	public	doesn’t	see	you as	purchasing	your	way	off	of	Titan.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	resent	you	saying	that	to	my	client,”	Nancy	interrupted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	 get	 to	 my	 point.	 There’s	 another	 fast	 cruiser	 arriving	 in	 four	 months.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 took	 a	 breath.	 “Give	 me	 three	 months	 on	 the	 ice-miner,	 with	 three	 more weeks	 of	 public	 service,	 and	 I’ll	 drop	 the	 charges	 to	 involuntary	 human-slaughter.	 You’ll	 be	 getting	 back	 to	 Earth	 faster	 than	 if	 you	 took	 the	 working cruise,	which	would	be	the	next	available	if	the	trial	lasts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	turned	to	Nancy,	who	met	her	stare.	Nancy	looked	back	at	Jack	Reagan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	I	have	a	few	moments	to	discuss	with	my	client?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly,”	 he	 said.	 He	 picked	 up	 his	 tablet	 and	 walked	 out	 of	 the conference	room,	shutting	the	door	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	think,	Pati?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Besides	I’m	probably	rich?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	think	of	his	offer?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Should	I	take	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	his	logic	is	sensible.	You	can’t	spend	the	money	when	you’re	in	jail.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	should	accept	the	offer,	then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	way	in	hell	you	should	accept	his	offer,”	Nancy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	not.	He	knows	this	case	is	falling	apart	at	the	seams.	The	offer	is a	last-ditch	attempt	to	keep	you	from	walking	away	scot-free.	I	say	we	tell	him, thanks,	but	no	thanks.	The	decision	is	up	to	you,	though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 was	 at	 a	 loss.	 This	 could	 be	 the	 most	 important	 decision	 of	 her	 life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three	 months	 wasn’t	 that	 long	 of	 a	 time,	 and	 it	 was	 light-years	 shorter	 than	 a repatriation	 trip	 back	 to	 Earth.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 Nancy	 was	 sure	 she’d	 be walking	away	with	no	service	to	the	state,	and	in	her	last	settlement,	she’d	gotten better	than	Pati	could	have	hoped	for.	“Okay,	let’s	try	to	be	nice,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	got	up	and	walked	to	the	door.	She	invited	Jack	Reagan	back	in,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	took	his	seat	as	Nancy	took	hers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,	Jack,	not	happening	on	the	settlement,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a>He	looked	upset.	“I’m	not	playing	games	here,	counselor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Games,	 you	 say,”	 Nancy	 exclaimed.	 “You	 should	 have	 dropped	 this	 case after	 the	 first	 JJ	 result.	 Now	 you	 think	 you’re	 saving	 the	 state’s	 resources	 by offering	 my	 client	 a	 shorter	 sentence.	 You	 must	 be	 the	 one	 playing	 games because	 you	 seem	 to	 think	 if	 you	 lose	 this	 case,	 you’ll	 get	 a	 do-over.	 Well,	 it doesn’t	 work	 that	 way,	 and	 if	 you	 don’t	 drop	 this	 case,	 and	 the	 JJ	 comes	 back with	a	20,	I’ll	petition	to	have	you	removed	from	the	state	attorney’s	office.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	Reagan	glared	at	Nancy.	He	didn’t	respond,	and	tapped	a	few	buttons	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 tablet	 with	 the	 stylus.	 “If	 I	 don’t	 receive	 further	 information	 from	 you, counselor,	I	will	see	you	at	the	settlement	conference	next	week.”	He	looked	at Pati,	“Ms.	Lynch,”	he	said,	and	walked	out	of	the	conference	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	didn’t	take	that	well,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	our	problem,	Pati.	He	knows	he	can’t	drag	you	through	the	mud,	trying</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	wear	you	down	and	get	a	settlement.	He	seems	determined	to	try,	and	I	guess he’s	 pinning	 his	 hopes	 on	 the	 recordings	 and	 thinks	 they’ll	 show	 something	 to help	convict	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nobody	 would	 be	 happier	 to	 have	 those	 recordings	 restored	 than	 me.	 It sucks	not	being	able	to	tell	the	whole	truth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	 worry	 about	 it.	 We’ve	 got	 a	 great	 head	 of	 steam	 here,	 and	 if	 Jack Reagan	doesn’t	get	out	of	the	way,	his	career	will	get	crushed.	He’ll	have	no	one to	blame	but	himself,	because	he	has	so	little	evidence.”	Nancy	shook	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	not	a	bad	guy;	he	just	doesn’t	know	when	to	quit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	he	thinks	he’s	doing	the	right	thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	shook	her	head	again.	“The	right	thing	would	be	to	leave	you	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	 gave	 your	 testimony,	 and	 all	 the	 physical	 evidence	 supports	 it.	 I	 would think,	 after	 this	 ruling,	 he’d	 accept	 it.	 We	 can	 hope	 he’ll	 change	 his	 mind;	 I’m not	holding	my	breath.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would	you	really	try	to	get	him	fired?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	won’t	be	me.	If	that	score	goes	any	lower	in	the	third	hearing,	it’ll	go	to the	mayor’s	office,	and	he’ll	have	hell	to	pay.	It’s	a	shame	really	because	he’s	not a	weasel	like	Keebler,	but	he’ll	have	to	suffer	more.”	She	stood	up	and	motioned for	Pati	to	do	the	same.	“That’s	not	our	problem.	We	need	to	worry	only	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	case,	which,	I	think,	won’t	go	past	the	last	settlement	conference.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	looked	around	the	conference	room	before	she	walked	out	with	Nancy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	this	room,	she	learned	that	she	would	soon	go	free	and	that	she	was	rich.	How much	better	could	it	get? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a><b class="calibre2">7	The	Big	Problem</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	afternoon	and	evening	had	been	a	complete	waste.	First,	she	tried	to	see	the constables	 investigating	 the	 rebreather	 sabotage.	 After	 waiting	 an	 hour	 to	 see them,	they	had	no	answers	on	the	progress	of	the	case.	No	leads,	no	persons	of interest,	and	no	reason	a	villain	would	want	to	kill	her.	Pati	suspected	the	reason for	 the	 negative	 answers	 was	 a	 lack	 of	 dedication	 to	 finding	 a	 positive	 one.	 A positive	answer	that	might	lead	to	more	work	and	possibly	even	an	arrest,	which would	be	even	more	work.	She	stormed	out	of	their	office	in	frustration,	having made	no	new	friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	rest	of	the	evening,	she	had	zero	to	do.	It	was	Friday,	and	like	on	Earth,	a day	 to	 celebrate	 the	 end	 of	 the	 workweek.	 Pati	 didn’t	 dare	 leave	 her	 room, though;	 she	 still	 believed	 someone	 was	 out	 to	 get	 her,	 and	 putting	 herself	 in harm's	way	for	a	good	time	could	wait	till	she	returned	to	Earth.	Then,	she	could celebrate	all	week,	and	not	just	Friday	evening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 her	 blank	 agenda,	 she	 turned	 in	 early.	 Unfortunately,	 the	 drowsiness wasn’t	happening	right	away,	and	she	just	laid	there	on	her	back.	She	pulled	her arm	away	from	her	eyes	and	stared	at	the	bedroom	ceiling.	At	least	in	one-sixth gravity,	she	was	comfortable.	She	let	the	frustrations	of	the	day	subside,	and	as they	did,	she	relaxed.	Within	a	few	minutes,	she	felt	sleep	come	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	she	was	in	her	bedroom.	Not	her	bedroom,	her	and	Richard’s	bedroom</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	 she	 enjoyed	 the	 lifestyle	 of	 the	 rich	 and	 famous.	 She	 sat	 at	 her	 dressing desk,	empty	of	any	hair-dressing	tool,	and	the	mirror	didn’t	reflect	her	face.	The colors	 resembled	 the	 overcast	 dock	 in	 Dingle,	 which	 was	 strange	 because	 she remembered	bright	colors	in	this	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	Pati,”	she	heard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 turned	 and	 saw	 Richard	 standing	 there.	 He	 was	 wearing	 a	 tailored business	suit,	not	the	informal	clothes	he	always	wore.	The	only	time	he	sported a	 business	 suit	 was	 when	 he	 had	 meetings	 with	 his	 father	 or	 brother	 and	 they required	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	not	Richard	McLear,”	Richard	said	next. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	a	shock.	“Who	are	you	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Call	me	Temujin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	Mr.	Temujin,	why	are	you	in	our	bedroom?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	met	before.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	ask	you	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>“True,	 but	 I	 needed	 to	 introduce	 myself,	 and	 it	 seemed	 appropriate	 to	 give you	a	reference	because	I	did	not	look	then	how	I	look	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	remember	meeting	a	Mr.	Temujin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	identified	myself	as	Richard	McLear	because	I	wanted	you	to	know	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">ended	your	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ended	her	life?	She	was	still	alive.	“Nobody	has	ended	my	life,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“True,	you	escaped	your	fate.	I	was	highly	impressed	with	your	actions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 made	 the	 connection.	 This	 was	 the	 apparition	 that	 appeared	 on	 her water-mining	ship	as	the	life	support	systems	went	south.	He	said	then	his	reason for	 ending	 her	 life	 was	 revenge	 for	 killing	 Richard,	 even	 though	 he	 wasn’t Richard,	or	was	he?	“So	why	are	you	here,	talking	to	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	decided	you’re	worth	more	to	me	alive,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	 killing	 Richard	 McLear,	 you	 set	 my	 plans	 back	 at	 least	 one	 of	 your lifetimes.	 I	 had	 the	 perfect	 host,	 and	 like	 the	 others,	 he	 willingly	 agreed	 to	 the hosting.	 The	 anger	 I	 directed	 at	 you,	 well,	 I	 can	 only	 say	 I’m	 not	 proud	 of	 my actions	because	it	took	exceptional	resources	to	reach	you	out	there	amongst	the rings,	and	after	all	that	work,	you	still	survived.	Then,	my	people	tried	a	second time	 to	 kill	 you,	 and	 you	 survived	 that	 as	 well.	 Since	 that	 time,	 I	 decided	 you were	far	more	valuable	with	us	than	dead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	still	don’t	know	what	you’re	getting	at.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	 join	 with	 one	 of	 us.	 We’ve	 been	 trying	 to	 entice	 you	 using	 more subtle	methods.	Unfortunately,	my	first	emissary	met	with	an	untimely	end	when you…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 didn’t	 interrupt	 when	 he	 paused.	 He	 seemed	 to	 search	 for	 words, although	the	words	were	to	describe	an	action	she	took.	She	wondered	what	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">did,	without	wanting	to	ask	this,	Mr.	Temujin,	did	he	say? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Had	your	gravity	treatment,”	he	said.	“Few	Earthlings	have	that	treatment, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	it	was	the	first	time	we	saw	what	could	happen.	It	affected	me,	too,	because she	was	one	of	my,	I	think	the	best	word	is	staff,	or	maybe	entourage	is	the	better word.	I	had	to	substitute	another	who	is	now	ready.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	want	me	to	join	with	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	me,	one	of	our	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	would	I	do	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	this	reason,”	he	said,	and	as	he	finished	the	statement,	a	wave	of	ecstasy flowed	through	her.	Just	like	the	other	times,	only	stronger,	more	powerful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t	this	what	you	desire?”	she	heard	Richard,	or	Mr.	Temujin,	ask. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>She	 couldn’t	 respond.	 She	 could	 only	 feel	 the	 high,	 so	 much	 like	 the	 pain drugs	she	had	received	after	breaking	her	leg	as	a	child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	she	ready?”	Pati	heard.	It	was	the	child’s	voice	she	heard	in	her	dreams. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	is	up	to	her.	I	think	she	is	enjoying	the	experience,	aren’t	you,	Pati?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	you	want	to	come	with	us,	don’t	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 did,	 only	 what	 about	 her	 family	 on	 Earth?	 She	 got	 the	 distinct	 feeling that	saying	yes	now	would	mean	she	would	never	see	them	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pati,	 you	 must	 think	 of	 yourself,	 of	 your	 own	 pleasure.	 Nobody	 will	 ever give	you	pleasure	like	this,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	right,	and	yet,	did	the	ecstasy	lessen	as	he	said	it?	The	feeling	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	more	wonderful	than	anything	she	had	ever	experienced,	but	because	it	was less,	she	felt	some	depression.	She	focused	again	on	her	family,	and	the	ecstasy lessened	even	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	know	what	you’re	doing,	Pati,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	are	you?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	want	to	regret	this,”	he	said.	“You	are	being	offered	an	eternity	of bliss.	To	live	here	on	Titan	as	if	you	were	in	the	heaven	you	think	about.	It	can all	happen	right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	want	to	go	home,”	she	said.	She	saw	the	girl	standing	next	to	her,	on	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">right.	Richard/Temujin	stayed	to	her	front.	He	looked	very	upset. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	what	you	can	expect	if	you	leave,”	he	said.	The	ecstasy	left	her,	and deep	depression	filled	the	void.	She	no	longer	wanted	to	live,	because	she	felt	so sad.	There	was	no	reason	to	be	sad;	she	felt	sad	anyway.	And	sad	was	too	light	a word.	 It	 felt	 as	 though	 someone	 in	 her	 family	 died,	 that	 a	 psychological	 crutch had	been	pulled	out	from	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	what	you	can	expect	if	you	go	back	to	Earth,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	going	back	to	Earth,”	she	replied.	Depression	or	not,	she	knew	what	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 won’t	 get	 away	 from	 me	 another	 time.	 Our	 person	 nearly	 killed	 you outside	the	walls,	and	if	you	don’t	join	us,	you’ll	be	dead	before	you	leave	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	should	accept	the	better	fate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!”	she	screamed.	She	jumped	from	her	chair	and	launched	herself	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	that	looked	like	Richard	McLear.	As	her	hands	approached	his	throat,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">sneered.	Then,	she	was	in	a	mist	of	white	and	felt	a	cushion	below	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	popped	her	head	up	from	the	pillow.	She’d	rolled	over	in	her	sleep,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	a	prone	position	swung	her	head	as	far	around	as	it’d	go,	and	back	the	other way. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>They	 were	 there	 in	 the	 room.	 Reddish-orange	 apparitions	 hovering	 next	 to her	bed,	in	approximately	the	same	locations	as	they’d	been	in	her	dream.	They didn’t	stay	long;	she	watched	them	move	through	the	air	to	the	end	of	her	bed, and	together	they	disappeared	into	the	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	rolled	over	again	as	they	left,	sat	up,	and	with	her	right	hand,	rubbed	her eyes.	She	checked	the	time;	it	was	almost	four	in	the	morning.	She’d	been	asleep for	about	five	hours.	Was	the	dream	that	long? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	didn’t	matter,	the	thing	that	tried	to	kill	her	had	come	back.	Somehow,	it’d gotten	into	her	head	and	affected	her	dreams. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	what	could	she	do	about	it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	need	to	talk,”	Pati	said.	She’d	called	Nancy	after	she	woke	up,	and	Nancy</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	just	appeared	on	the	screen.	She	must	have	taken	a	minute	to	straighten	her hair,	 because	 otherwise,	 she	 couldn’t	 have	 been	 sleeping.	 Low	 gravity	 solved many	human	problems,	keeping	yourself	picture-perfect	while	sleeping	was	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	ah,	what’s	going	on?”	Nancy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	contacted	by	the	aliens	again,	this	time	in	my	room.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy’s	face	tightened.	“Pati,	we’re	not	on	a	secure	line.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	okay,	I’ve	got	to	tell	someone,	and	soon.	This	can’t	wait.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	final	hearing	is	next	week.	It	can	wait	till	after	then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	it	can’t,	you	see—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop	talking,	right	now!”	Nancy	ordered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	looked	busy	at	her	workstation.	Pati	didn’t	have	a	similar	arrangement</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 her	 apartment	 and	 had	 to	 use	 the	 video	 screen	 in	 the	 living	 room	 to	 contact people.	Pati	waited	about	a	minute,	and	Nancy	returned	her	attention	to	Pati.	“I engaged	 a	 security	 service	 for	 the	 call.	 It’s	 not	 cheap,	 but	 it’ll	 keep	 our communications	from	being	tapped.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	that	sounds	good,	for	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Speaking	of	now,	do	you	know	what	time	it	is?	On	a	Saturday	morning,	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">less.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	you	see,	I	just	had	a	dream.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	dream!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>“No,	that’s	not	just	it.	You	see,	Nancy,	I	was	dreaming,	kind	of	like	the	other dreams	I’ve	been	having.	And	you	see,	it	all	ended,	and	I	saw	those	things	like	I saw	on	my	ship,	when	that	thing	that	pretended	to	be	my	ex-husband	appeared	to me,	except,	there	were	two	of	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	did	they	look	like?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 was	 the	 same,	 goldish-red	 kind	 of	 glowing	 objects,	 smaller	 than	 us,	 I think,	and	they	floated.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh-huh,”	Nancy	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then,	after	I	woke	up,	and	saw	them	in	the	room,	they	floated	through	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wall	and	out	of	my	bedroom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 hadn’t	 moved	 a	 facial	 muscle.	 “No	 records	 of	 this	 event,	 I	 expect,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	don’t	turn	that	on	in	my	bedroom,	why	would	I?	I	mean,	most	people</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t,	and	why	would	I	expect	something	like	this	to	happen	to	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Those	aliens	might	return,	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 I	 don’t	 think	 so.	 The	 conversations	 we	 had,	 the	 ones	 in	 my	 dreams,	 I don’t	 think	 they	 were	 happy.”	 Pati	 paused	 for	 a	 second.	 “Do	 you	 think	 they might	be	who’s	trying	to	kill	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pati,	unfortunately,	there’s	no	shortage	of	people	who	might	want	you	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Could	 be	 someone	 with	 the	 McLears,	 or	 with	 Bruno	 Redden’s	 family.	 Maybe one	of	the	twins	had	a	girlfriend	we	never	discovered	or	a	long-lost	friend.	And nobody	is	going	to	be	sympathetic	with	a	former	Marie	Antoinette	who	fell	from her	lofty	position.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	stared	back	at	the	screen.	“That	wasn’t	nice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	okay,	you’re	right.	Sorry	about	that,	it’s	just	that	you	got	me	up	early on	a	Saturday	and,	to	be	honest,	Pati,	I	not	sure	what	I	can	tell	you	that	I	haven’t told	 you	 already.	 No	 matter	 what	 happens,	 unless	 you	 come	 up	 with	 some	 real proof,	 proof	 other	 than	 your	 personal	 witness,	 you	 can’t	 go	 public	 with	 this before	your	final	hearing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	 but	 they	 might	 be	 trying	 to	 kill	 me.	 First,	 there	 are	 a	 lot	 of unanswered	questions	about	my	ship’s	life	support	going	south	if	we	don’t	have an	alien	taking	credit	to	kill	me.	Then,	there’s	the	sabotaged	rebreather,	again,	a lot	 of	 unanswered	 questions,	 and	 maybe	 we	 have	 a	 possessed	 person	 like	 what happened	to	my	ex-husband.	And,	I’m	pretty	sure	that’s	what	the	aliens	wanted</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	me	just	now.	They	said	they	wanted	me	to	join	with	them,	except	I	wanted</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	go	back	to	Earth	too	bad,	and…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy,	again,	didn’t	move	a	facial	muscle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 decided	 not	 to	 ask	 Nancy	 if	 she	 believed	 her.	 “These	 things	 keep happening	 to	 me,”	 she	 said,	 “and	 I’m	 not	 crazy.	 You	 could	 have	 used	 that	 as	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>defense	if	that	possibility	existed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	I	know,	you’re	not	crazy.	That’s	why	it’s	so	difficult	to	dismiss	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re	 saying,	 which	 I’m	 not	 doing.	 I	 have	 to	 consider	 your	 legal	 case	 first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Which	I	believe	I’m	right	in	doing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nancy,	you	see,	these	dreams—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	 dreams,	 Pati.	 We	 have	 zero	 proof	 to	 justify	 any	 statements	 you	 make about	your	dreams,	and	while	we	can	certify	you’re	not	crazy,	it	will	be	far	better if	we	don’t	have	to	go	that	route	in	the	first	place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nancy,	I	have	to	do	something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 paused,	 she	 did	 move	 her	 facial	 muscles	 though	 and	 seemed	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought.	“Okay,	we	can	talk	about	who	you	want	to	see	after	we	settle	with	Jack Reagan	this	week.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	want	to	wait	that	long	to	discuss	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	we	can	discuss	it	on	Monday	morning.	I	just	don’t	want	you	speaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	this	to	anyone	until	after	we	settle	with	him	on	Tuesday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then,	 we	 won’t	 be	 getting	 in	 front	 of	 the	 JJ	 next	 Thursday	 for	 a	 final hearing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	don’t	want	to	beat	Jack	Reagan	up	too	bad.	As	long	as	you’re	good</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	a	month	or	so	of	labor	dedicated	to	the	state.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	good,	as	long	as	I	don’t	have	to	go	out	on	an	ice-miner	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	we	can	give	him	enough	to	settle	with	us.	At	least,	I’m	pretty	sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’ll	 settle.	 He	 can’t	 afford	 professionally	 to	 let	 the	 JJ	 score	 get	 below	 twenty, and	we’re	close	to	that.	You’ll	walk	free	then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	would	be	better.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“However,	it’s	not	guaranteed,	I	don’t	advise	we	neglect	a	settlement.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	we’re	good	about	keeping	the	alien	thing	under	wraps	till	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	I	guess	so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And,	I	can	get	back	to	sleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry	about	that,	I’ll	try	and	call	during	business	hours	next	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	okay.	I’ll	see	you	on	Monday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,	 see	 you	 then,”	 Pati	 said.	 She	 turned	 her	 screen	 off	 and	 ended	 the conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>Pati	marched	into	Nancy’s	office	first	thing	Monday	morning.	The	building	was empty,	making	Pati	afraid	she’d	arrived	too	early.	Making	her	way	through	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">building,	she	arrived	at	Nancy’s	door	and	knocked.	Nancy	let	her	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 surprised	 Pati	 how	 tired	 she	 looked.	 Her	 clothes	 were	 clean	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">unwrinkled,	so	she	hadn’t	been	sitting	at	her	desk	all	night.	The	look	on	her	face suggested	otherwise.	The	redness	in	her	eyes	did	as	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	her	obvious	exhaustion,	Nancy	launched	into	a	long	dissertation	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">needing	to	wait	to	release	any	information	contrary	to	their	defense.	The	fatigue she	showed	did	not	match	the	energy	she	put	into	the	argument,	which	couldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">really	 be	 called	 an	 argument	 because	 she	 did	 all	 the	 talking.	 When	 she	 had finished,	Pati	could	only	agree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	behind	Pati	slammed	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	were	you!”	Joe	Tate	screamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	said	you	could	come	in	here!”	Nancy	screamed	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	backed	into	the	wall	on	her	left	to	get	out	of	the	line	of	fire.	Joe	had	a red	in	his	face	that	Pati	learned	in	Ireland	meant	he	was	close	to	crazy.	His	eyes were	bulging	out,	and	some	of	the	veins	in	his	neck	and	head	were	noticeable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	instincts	were	to	not	get	in	his	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	what	if	he	attacked	Nancy?	She	would	feel	the	need	to	jump	in	and	help, </p>
<p class="calibre1">except	she	would	stand	little	chance	of	holding	him	back.	Damn,	there	were	way too	many	Earth	immigrants	here! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	 slammed	 the	 door	 behind	 him	 and	 stomped	 up	 to	 Nancy’s	 desk.	 He didn’t	note	Pati’s	presence	in	any	way.	“You	were	supposed	to	meet	me,”	he	said at	slightly	less	than	a	yell.	“Meet	me	an	hour	ago,	and	you	didn’t	show	up.	What the	hell	was	I	supposed	to	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	doesn’t	give	you	the	right	to	come	storming	in	here.	Now	get	out!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	settling	this,	right	here,	right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	are	not	doing	anything	until	you	get	out	of	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	shook	his	head	at	her.	His	face	seemed	even	redder	than	when	he	walked</p>
<p class="calibre1">in;	the	veins,	even	more	prominent.	He	leaned	forward	and	put	his	hands	on	her desk.	“If	you	try	to	make	me	leave,	you	will	regret	it,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	will	already	regret	this,”	she	said	back.	“I’m	not	afraid	of	having	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrested.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 caught	 a	 slight	 smile	 in	 his	 profile,	 “You	 know,	 I’m	 not	 worried	 about that.	What	can	they	do	to	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 fidgeted,	 which	 was	 the	 most	 unusual	 action	 Pati	 had	 seen	 so	 far	 in this	high-decibel	verbal	battle.	Pati	waited	for	her	reply	because	in	the	time	she’d known	Nancy,	she	was	as	skilled	with	the	word	as	a	samurai	with	the	sword.	For some	reason,	she	was	speechless. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>“What	do	you	want	to	do?”	Joe	asked.	His	voice	seemed	less	violent,	almost giving	 her	 an	 opportunity	 to	 negotiate	 or	 compromise.	 His	 body	 seemed	 less tense,	the	red	had	gone	from	his	face,	and	the	veins	were	no	longer	visible.	Pati sensed	he	would	not	be	violent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	asked	you	to	leave,”	Nancy	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	all	you	got	to	say,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	got	nothing	to	talk	about,	I	mean,	it’s	not	like	you’ve	tried	to	hide	your intentions.	I	know	you	want	to	go	back	to	Earth,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	never	said	that,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	but	you	go	to	the	gravity	clinic	every	month.	That’s	a	lot	of	pain	to	take for	someone	who	plans	to	spend	the	rest	of	their	life	with	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	doesn’t	mean	I	plan	on	leaving.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 else	 could	 it	 be?	 And	 since	 I	 can	 never	 visit	 Earth,	 it’s	 plain	 you’re going	to	leave	me	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,	I—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	not	about	me,	it’s	about	you	waiting	till	you	have	the	right	time	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">leave.	You	keep	acting	like	you	want	us	to	stay	together,	but	you	only	want	me until	you’re	ready	to	leave.	Why	should	I	respond	to	you	when	that’s	what	I	can expect	will	happen?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	stood	up	straight.	All	the	aggressive	energy	that	dissipated	from	his	body about	 a	 minute	 ago	 had	 built	 back	 up.	 He	 raised	 his	 hands	 off	 the	 desk	 as	 he stood	straight,	put	them	on	his	hips	while	he	stared	at	her,	and	then	he	brought his	hands	up.	Pati	sensed	an	animal	about	to	spring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 act	 like	 this	 arrangement	 has	 been	 good	 for	 me,”	 Nancy	 continued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	would	work	all	the	time—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	 else	 can	 I	 make	 a	 living?”	 His	 fists	 clenched,	 tightened,	 and	 opened again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 make	 a	 living,	 not	 just	 you.	 There’s	 more	 than	 enough	 money	 for	 us both,	so	you	must	be	trying	to	save	up	to	go	back	to	Earth,	where	I	can’t	possibly live.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	could,	if	you	tried,”	Joe	gritted	through	his	teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 not	 going	 to	 go	 through	 that	 torture.	 You	 knew	 I	 couldn’t	 go	 to	 Earth when	 you	 asked	 me	 to	 marry	 you;	 now	 you	 want	 to	 change	 everything	 just because	you’re	a	failure	here	on	Titan.	All	the	other	immigrants	that	come	here become	 successful,	 and	 somehow	 you’re	 the	 one	 who	 can’t	 make	 it,	 and	 you want	me	to	follow	you	like	a	puppy	dog	back	to	Earth	when	you’re	the	one	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	tail	between	his	legs!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	saw	the	moment	he	began	his	lunge	across	her	desk	to	throttle	her.	It	was like	slow	motion	when	he	first	went	back	on	his	heels,	and	then	the	legs	would</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>spring,	 pushing	 the	 rest	 of	 his	 body	 into	 a	 leap—but	 the	 door	 slammed	 back open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	 right,	 nobody	 move,”	 the	 first	 man	 in	 the	 blue	 jumpsuit	 said.	 He	 was one	of	two,	and	although	shorter	than	the	other,	he	stood	as	tall	as	Nancy.	Both had	tranquilizer	handguns	attached	to	their	black	belts.	However,	it	was	their	size and	 Aryan	 facial	 features	 that	 physically	 dominated	 the	 room.	 “We	 had complaints	about	the	noise,	folks,”	he	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	stopped	and	then	stood	straight	up,	seemingly	innocent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you	for	coming,	constable,”	Nancy	said.	“You’re	the	two	new-hires</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 Earth,	 correct?”	 Nancy	 mentioned	 earlier	 she	 kept	 an	 eye	 on	 the	 police force	enlisted	to	protect	and	serve	Karakorum.	If	she	didn’t	know	these	two	by name,	she	knew	where	they	came	from. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 ma’am,	 we	 are.	 I’m	 Constable	 Reich,	 and	 this	 is	 Constable	 Shultz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’ve	been	here	on	Titan	the	last	six	months.	Constable-Sergeant	Jones	had	us</p>
<p class="calibre1">patrolling	 the	 buildings	 in	 this	 area,	 and	 we	 heard	 shouting.	 Do	 you	 need	 any assistance?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	at	Joe	after	he	posed	the	question.	Joe	had	initially	looked	in	their direction	when	they	walked	in.	Joe	then	turned	back	to	look	at	Nancy	and	kept</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking	at	her	during	the	conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	depends,”	Nancy	said.	She	looked	at	Joe,	“Are	we	done?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	 looked	 at	 his	 feet	 and	 exhaled.	 “Yeah,	 we’re	 done,”	 he	 said.	 He	 turned and	 walked	 past	 the	 constables	 who	 moved	 out	 of	 the	 shorter	 man’s	 path.	 Joe walked	out	the	door	and	turned	left	toward	the	exit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will	he	be	back	after	we	leave?”	Constable	Reich	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	he	won’t	be	back,”	Nancy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,	 we’ll	 follow	 him	 out,	 and	 if	 he	 tries	 to	 return,	 we’ll	 intervene,”	 he said.	 He	 walked	 out,	 followed	 by	 Constable	 Shultz,	 who	 shut	 the	 door	 behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 sorry	 you	 had	 to	 see	 that,	 Pati,”	 Nancy	 said.	 She	 sat	 down,	 looking more	exhausted	than	she	did	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	 you	 go	 home?”	 Pati	 asked.	 She’d	 seen	 this	 back	 home	 in	 Dingle, except	 it	 was	 her	 older	 brother	 who	 couldn’t	 go	 home.	 Fortunately,	 he	 stayed with	their	parents	till	it	all	blew	over,	and	they	got	back	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	he	didn’t	come	home	over	the	weekend,	so	I	don’t	expect	he’ll	be	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">tonight.	I’ll	probably	change	the	entry	permissions	when	I	get	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d	 thought	 you’d	 have	 to	 get	 the	 court	 to	 allow	 that,”	 Pati	 said.	 “I	 mean, you’re	a	great	lawyer,	but	I	have	trouble	believing	even	you	could	pull	that	off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 seemed	 to	 think	 for	 a	 second,	 and	 then	 said,	 “He	 lost	 his	 job	 right after	 we	 visited	 the	 spaceport.	 That	 and	 his	 absence	 will	 give	 me	 the	 legal</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>standing	I	need.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 a	 cold	 statement,	 and	 apparently,	 Nancy’s	 ability	 to	 hold	 back	 her feelings	 were	 finally	 breached.	 She	 looked	 down	 and	 sobbed.	 Nancy	 put	 her arms	on	her	desk	and	sunk	her	head	into	them,	crying,	weeping,	and	trying	hard to	stop,	without	success. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati’s	dormant	maternal	instincts	kicked	in.	She	got	out	of	her	chair,	walked</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	to	Nancy,	and	hugged	her	from	behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	I	can	help	you,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	no,	it’s	all	right,”	Nancy	said.	Her	sobbing	waned,	and	she	went	silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 wondered	 if	 she	 fell	 asleep	 when	 she	 lifted	 her	 head	 and	 took	 Pati’s	 right hand	in	hers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,	 Pati,	 I	 know	 I	 can’t	 compare	 my	 problems	 to	 yours;	 it’s	 just	 all these	things	happening	from	different	directions	that	I	can’t	control.”	She	let	go of	Pati’s	hand	and	turned	to	look	her	in	the	eyes.	“I	will	take	care	of	you,	though; you	can	count	on	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	didn’t	doubt	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a><b class="calibre2">8	Mass	Media</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 couldn’t	 help	 but	 feel	 Nancy	 might	 not	 be	 at	 one	 hundred	 percent	 as	 her attorney.	The	next	few	days	were	critical;	the	time	Pati	needed	her	the	most.	If worse	 came	 to	 worst,	 she	 could	 relieve	 Nancy	 and	 find	 another	 lawyer	 to represent	 her.	 That	 action,	 unfortunately,	 had	 significant	 drawbacks.	 It	 would take	 more	 time,	 so	 escaping	 Titan	 wouldn’t	 happen	 soon,	 and	 there	 weren’t many	lawyers	as	good	as	Nancy	on	Titan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 mulled	 it	 over	 lunch	 at	 the	 Grand	 Center.	 After	 filling	 herself	 with	 a light	 meal	 comprised	 of	 chicken,	 eggs,	 rice,	 and	 spices	 she	 couldn’t	 name,	 she walked	to	the	trolley	station.	This	took	almost	as	long	as	the	trip	there	because the	lunch	crowd	was	getting	out	and	heading	back	to	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	waited,	followed,	and	then	entered	the	station	for	the	north-bound	line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 were	 so	 many	 people	 on	 the	 platform	 that	 the	 next	 train	 filled	 up	 before she	could	get	on.	The	doors	shut	in	front	of	her,	while	the	windows	showed	a	car packed	with	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 nowhere	 to	 be	 that	 afternoon,	 she	 didn’t	 worry.	 Some	 people	 shouted expletives	after	being	denied	a	ride,	and	one	guy	punched	the	side	of	the	train	as it	pulled	away.	Pati	hid	her	smile,	thinking	the	man	might	accost	her	for	finding humor	in	his	distress.	She	would	walk	away	if	he	did,	although,	with	this	tight crowd,	she	might	not	be	able	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stood	straight	up	on	the	edge	of	the	platform,	hoping	to	take	up	even	less space.	 Everyone	 else	 around	 her	 was	 taller,	 even	 the	 crowd	 on	 the	 other	 side waiting	for	their	train	heading	south,	which	she	heard	coming	from	her	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	the	northbound	train	that’d	just	left,	the	people	squeezed	in.	Pati	could no	longer	see	through	the	windows	to	the	other	side	and	expected	some	would	be left	 to	 wait	 for	 the	 next	 train	 like	 herself.	 The	 train	 didn’t	 leave	 right	 away, though. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	heard	the	clanging	from	the	left	side.	She	didn’t	bother	leaning	over	like most	 people	 to	 observe	 a	 train	 she	 already	 knew	 would	 soon	 arrive.	 Pati	 just stared	 ahead	 at	 the	 southbound	 train	 and	 waited,	 when	 she	 felt	 a	 push	 in	 the small	of	her	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	couldn’t	keep	her	balance.	She	fell	off	the	platform	and	into	the	path	of the	northbound	train.	The	distance	down	was	little	more	than	a	meter.	A	distance that	took	longer	to	fall	than	on	Earth,	and	long	enough	to	let	the	train	get	within striking	distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>The	southbound	train	blocked	one	means	of	escape.	The	platform	was	flush with	the	northbound	train,	blocking	another.	When	Pati	struck	the	steel	rails,	the train	had	only	a	few	more	meters	to	get	to	her.	It	looked	heavy	enough	to	crush her	to	death,	even	in	one-sixth	gravity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	torso	bounced	from	one	track,	and	the	track	gauge	was	short	enough	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	grab	the	other	rail	as	she	hit.	She	swung	her	feet	under	her	into	a	crouch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	clanging	filled	her	ears,	each	clang	getting	louder	and	louder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	danger	flashed	into	her	brain:	avoid	the	wheels.	No	time	to	plan.	She	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	act.	From	her	crouching	position,	she	jumped	straight	up,	facing	the	train	that rapidly	approached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	Titan,	she	could	jump	over	a	four-meter-high	train.	Time	was	not	on	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">side,	however,	and	the	train’s	windshield	met	her	as	she	rose.	The	force	launched her	 down	 the	 tracks.	 Her	 body	 flew	 out	 the	 north	 side	 of	 the	 station,	 and	 she landed	on	her	back,	hitting	a	rail.	Her	body	twisted,	and	she	rolled	perpendicular to	the	rail	for	a	few	meters.	She	stopped	rolling	face	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	didn’t	stop	thinking.	She	popped	her	head	up	to	see	where	she	was.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">stopped	between	the	northbound	and	southbound	tracks	and	was	apparently	safe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	right-side	torso	ached,	maybe	she	broke	a	rib	or	two? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	okay?”	a	man’s	voice	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 station	 was	 to	 her	 left,	 and	 from	 that	 direction,	 she	 saw	 the	 man	 in	 a light-brown	 utility	 uniform.	 Of	 European	 descent	 like	 herself,	 he	 looked	 tall enough	to	be	a	secgen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	I	just	got	hit	by	the	train,”	she	replied,	without	getting	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	move	then,”	he	said.	He	carried	a	package.	He	set	it	next	to	Pati	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">pulled	out	a	handheld	device	to	scan	her	body.	“I’m	Mike	Fineman,	the	station-</p>
<p class="calibre1">master	here.	Let	me	check	you	for	injuries.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 didn’t	 argue.	 She	 studied	 the	 surrounding	 area	 and	 decided	 no	 other dangers	awaited.	She	relaxed	for	the	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	obviously	Earth-born,”	he	said	while	scanning	her	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	my	ribs	are	broken,”	she	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 focused	 on	 her	 torso	 and	 spent	 a	 few	 more	 seconds	 with	 it.	 “No,	 just bruised.	Nothing	inside	of	your	ribcage	has	been	damaged,	so	that’s	good	news.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	scanned	her	legs	up	and	down	and	placed	the	handheld	back	in	the	package. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	helped	her	to	her	feet.	“Looks	like	you	came	out	of	this	little	worse	for	the wear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	see	who	pushed	me?”	Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	why	you	fell?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	jump.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	might	have	the	event	recorded,	except	it	was	really	crowded,	and,	well, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a>you’re	not	very	tall.	I	don’t	know	if	the	recordings	will	show	who	was	near	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	the	people	there	now?”	Pati	asked.	“Can	you	ask	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	call	the	constables,	but	I	think	if	someone	pushed	you,	they’re	gone	by now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	tried	to	take	a	deep	breath,	feeling	the	pain	in	her	right	side	as	she	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shouldn’t	the	train	at	least	try	to	stop	when	someone	falls	in	front	of	it?	I	mean, aren’t	there	safety	measures	for	that	kind	of	event?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	station-master	looked	down.	He	then	reached	for	Pati’s	arm.	“Let’s	clear</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	track	so	the	train	can	get	through,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait,	answer	my	question,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 met	 her	 eyes.	 “Okay,	 there	 are	 brakes	 in	 the	 station	 that’s	 supposed	 to bring	the	train	to	a	quick	stop	if	someone	falls	in,	but	that	didn’t	happen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	not?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 shrugged.	 “I	 think,	 because	 we	 had	 maintenance	 on	 the	 tracks	 this morning,	 and	 those	 brakes	 were	 not	 re-activated	 after	 testing.	 That’s	 the	 only explanation	 I	 can	 think	 of	 before	 I	 investigate	 and	 I	 don’t	 want	 to	 bias	 my opinion	by	speculating	now.”	He	pulled	her	arm.	“Come	on,	we	need	to	get	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	tracks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	let	him	pull	her	to	the	side.	He	then	let	go	of	her	arm,	and	they	walked</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	to	the	station.	The	train	that	hit	her	clanged	and	pulled	out,	heading	north full	 of	 passengers.	 She	 saw	 the	 faces	 staring	 at	 her	 as	 it	 headed	 north,	 and	 she wondered	which	one	of	them	had	pushed	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 Mike	 was	 right,	 though.	 Whoever	 pushed	 her	 would	 have	 admitted	 to the	 act	 right	 away	 if	 it	 was	 an	 accident.	 They	 were	 long	 gone	 because	 it	 was intentional,	or	maybe	it	was	an	accident	and	the	person	was	too	scared	to	come forward? </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	wondered	if	the	constables	would	investigate	what	happened.	Given	how</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	investigated	her	rebreather	sabotage,	she	wasn’t	hopeful.	It	was	time	for	her to	act	because	people	were	still	trying	to	kill	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	decided	against	seeing	a	doctor.	The	first	aid	kit	the	station-master	used	on her	told	her	all	she	needed	to	know,	and	the	bruises	would	heal	on	their	own	in	a few	 days.	 Right	 now,	 she	 had	 to	 find	 a	 way	 to	 prevent	 future	 accidents	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>happening	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead	 of	 taking	 the	 train	 south,	 she	 walked	 toward	 the	 administrative buildings	next	to	the	Grand	Center.	The	building	she	entered	looked	like	the	rest: the	 main	 entrance,	 winged	 by	 three	 floors	 of	 office	 windows,	 and	 elevators behind	a	static	robot	acting	as	a	receptionist.	She	passed	the	robot	without	asking a	question	and	took	the	middle	elevator	up	to	the	third	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	offices	of	the	Titan	Entertainment	Network	were	unassuming.	A	simple</p>
<p class="calibre1">plaque	on	the	door,	down	the	hallway	from	an	architect’s	office,	and	across	from an	energy	contractor.	It	functioned	as	the	only	local	entertainment	source	for	the Saturnian	 system.	 A	 space	 that	 could	 hold	 millions	 of	 Earths,	 it	 served	 only twenty-five	thousand	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 had	 to	 tell	 somebody	 about	 the	 apparitions.	 Pati	 had	 been	 contacted multiple	times	by	extraterrestrials,	and	it	was	time	to	get	the	word	out	if	only	to keep	the	aliens	from	killing	her.	Nancy	said	not	to,	and	would	probably	kill	Pati for	coming	here.	It	wasn’t	Nancy’s	life,	though. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	pushed	the	doorbell	and	heard	an	old-fashion	buzzing	sound.	“Come	in,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 English-accented	 male	 voice	 told	 her,	 and	 she	 almost	 laughed	 hearing	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 English	 as	 the	 primary	 language	 of	 humanity,	 throughout	 an	 entire	 solar system,	it	seemed	incredible	that	she	could	still	distinguish	her	Irish	accent	from an	English	one,	even	with	the	lands	separated	by	only	a	saltwater	river. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	dwell	and	stepped	through	the	door	into	an	open-space	office.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">noted	six,	maybe	seven	desks,	with	people	hard	at	work	on	meter-wide	screens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	one	of	them	lifted	their	head	to	note	that	she’d	walked	into	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,”	she	said	to	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">None	 of	 the	 workers	 took	 notice.	 She	 waited	 a	 minute	 to	 see	 if	 one	 would finish	their	task	and	greet	her.	After	two	minutes,	she	tried	again	with	a	slightly louder	 voice,	 with	 the	 same	 result.	 The	 nearest	 desk	 had	 a	 young	 lady	 with blonde	hair	pulled	back	into	a	ponytail.	She	approached	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pati,	you	made	it,”	Connie	Pearson	said	from	behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	wore	the	same	business	attire	as	when	she	visited	Pati	at	her	old	house, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 she	 looked	 the	 same	 as	 that	 time.	 Pati	 extended	 her	 hand,	 “I’m	 glad	 you could	meet	with	me	with	such	short	notice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	problem	at	all,	do	you	want	to	come	back	to	my	office?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,”	 Pati	 said.	 Connie	 turned	 and	 walked	 toward	 the	 end	 of	 the	 large room.	Pati	caught	up	with	her	and	leaned	in	close	as	they	passed	a	worker	at	his desk.	“What,	do	they	do?”	Pati	asked,	pointing	back	at	the	workers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Connie	stopped	and	looked	around.	“They	build	our	local	television	shows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 need	 content	 and	 would	 have	 to	 purchase	 it	 from	 Earth	 if	 we	 didn’t	 have them.	Pretty	much	every	local	television	show	you’ve	watched	since	you	came</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>to	Titan	began	on	those	screens.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	are	the	actors?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can’t	afford	to	bring	them	here,	and	the	computers	easily	replicate	them	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 screen.	 Earth	 has	 an	 abundance	 of	 performing	 arts	 people,	 so	 it’s	 never	 too expensive	to	shoot	a	pic	there.	Here,	they’d	just	be	an	unnecessary	expense.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 surprised	 Pati	 to	 hear	 this,	 but	 when	 she	 gave	 it	 some	 thought	 it	 made sense.	 Back	 when	 she	 was	 married	 to	 Richard,	 she	 had	 time	 to	 watch	 some shows	they	produced	here	on	Titan,	and	the	characters	were	as	real	as	anything she’d	seen	on	Earth.	One	of	the	male	leads	had	her	thinking	about	sending	him	a message	 if	 Richard	 divorced	 her.	 Maybe	 the	 simulated	 actors	 were	 too	 good	 to be	true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 returned	 to	 the	 real	 world	 as	 they	 stepped	 into	 Connie’s	 office,	 and unlike	most	offices	she	walked	into,	she	had	to	study	her	walls.	“How	much	did it	cost	you	to	ship	all	of	this?”	Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 office	 walls	 were	 made	 of	 the	 fake	 wood	 used	 throughout	 Karakorum, but	 on	 the	 dark-brown	 walls	 were	 sports	 memorabilia,	 plaques	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">accomplishment,	pictures	of	families,	and	items	she	couldn’t	quite	identify.	She saw	more	of	the	trinkets	hanging	on	the	walls	than	she	could	see	of	the	walls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please,	 sit	 here,”	 Connie	 said,	 motioning	 to	 a	 small,	 round	 table	 with	 two chairs	that	sat	in	a	corner	next	to	the	door.	Pati	walked	left	and	took	one	of	the padded	 chairs	 opposite	 Connie’s	 desk.	 Connie	 stepped	 behind	 her	 desk	 and pulled	out	a	tablet	and	stylus.	She	then	took	the	other	chair	at	the	table,	putting the	table	and	stylus	on	top. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	something	critical	to	discuss	with	me,”	Connie	said.	She	drew	a	few</p>
<p class="calibre1">lines	with	the	stylus	as	she	made	the	statement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	doing	with	the	tablet?”	Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	called	shorthand.	I	can	record	words	better	than	with	voice	recordings, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	I	can	put	my	own	notes	alongside.	It	took	me	a	long	time	to	master,	but	it’s paid	dividends	many	times	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	nodded,	somewhat	fascinated	with	the	idea	of	writing	notes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	want	to	tell	me?”	Connie	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	question	reminded	Pati	why	she	was	there,	and	she	didn’t	know	where	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">start.	“I’ve	been	contacted	by	extraterrestrials,”	she	said,	and	waited	for	Connie to	kick	her	out	of	her	office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Connie	 did	 not	 break	 eye	 contact	 as	 she	 took	 her	 notes,	 and	 her	 expression widened	slightly	after	Pati	made	the	declaration.	Her	stylus	stopped;	she	put	it	on to	the	table,	and	she	leaned	forward.	“How?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	believe	me?”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	depends	on	what	you	tell	me.	Your	story	will	have	to	make	sense.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a>Pati	 nodded.	 “Yes,	 I	 see	 what	 you	 mean.	 How	 do	 you	 want	 me	 to	 tell	 you what	happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Start	talking.	I’ll	interrupt	only	if	I	have	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 told	 her	 about	 the	 dreams,	 how	 she	 met	 the	 girl,	 and	 about	 the	 ecstasy she	would	feel	at	the	end	of	the	dream.	She	told	her	about	seeing	Richard	in	her dream,	 and	 after	 the	 fight,	 how	 she	 woke	 up	 and	 saw	 the	 apparitions	 in	 her bedroom.	Finally,	she	went	through	how	it	related	to	three	separate	attempts	to kill	her,	and	how	she	didn’t	want	a	fourth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Connie	took	notes	without	asking	questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	stopped	talking	and	waited.	Connie	kept	writing	notes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	apparitions	were	just	like	what	I	saw	in	my	dreams,”	Pati	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Connie	continued	to	write	notes	and	did	not	indicate	she	had	any	intention	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">asking	a	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Since	it	was	like	what	I	saw	on	the	mining	ship,	I’m	convinced	the	things</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	 real,	 or	 at	 least	 real	 beings.	 Things	 that	 are	 living	 and	 are	 like	 us.	 Except they’re	not	like	us,	only	that	they’re	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Connie	didn’t	stop	taking	notes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And,	 I	 think	 the	 one	 who	 talked	 to	 me	 had	 taken	 over	 Richard	 McLear,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?”	Connie	finally	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	because	he’s	always	identified	himself	as	Richard,	although	he	said	he’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">got	a	different	name.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 can’t	 remember.	 Something	 that	 began	 with	 a	 T.	 He	 said	 he	 was	 linked with	Richard	somehow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	stopped	talking.	Connie	continued	to	take	notes.	Pati	waited	her	out	this time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 said	 that	 you	 saw	 the	 apparition	 on	 the	 mining	 ship.	 Did	 this	 have anything	to	do	with	the	mutiny	you	alleged	happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Damn, </i>	 Pati	 thought.  <i class="calibre3">If	 Nancy	 wanted	 to	 kill	 her	 for	 coming	 here	 before,</i> <i class="calibre3">she’d	mutilate	the	body	for	this. </i>	Pati	resolved	before	she	met	with	Connie	not	to talk	 about	 what	 happened	 on	 the	 mining	 ship.	 That	 was	 for	 the	 trial,	 and	 she could	 discuss	 enough	 of	 what	 she’d	 experienced	 since	 then	 to	 get	 her	 point across. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	maybe	she	could	also	use	this	to	her	advantage.	“Connie,	I	didn’t	mean</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 discuss	 what	 happened	 on	 the	 mining	 ship.	 Because	 of	 my	 trial,	 I really	shouldn’t	talk	about	it,	so	I	need	you	to	promise	me	something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Connie	put	her	stylus	down	and	leaned	back.	“What	do	you	need?	Because</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	the	one	that	needs	your	information.	I	will	not	dictate	conditions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>“Thanks,	Connie,	I	appreciate	you	saying	that.	I	need	you	to	wait	until	after they	reach	the	verdict	before	publishing	anything	I	tell	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Connie	shrugged.	“It’ll	take	me	at	least	a	week	to	get	the	story	in	order,	and your	trial	ends	this	week,	I	think.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	meeting	with	my	lawyer	tomorrow	for	final	preparation,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	everything	going	well?”	Connie	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 nodded.	 “I	 think	 so.	 We’re	 not	 necessarily	 going	 to	 settle,	 and	 the preliminary	scores	would	have	me	acquitted	if	final.	After	tomorrow	I	should	be able	 to	 get	 rid	 of	 this.”	 Pati	 lifted	 her	 ankle	 above	 the	 table	 and	 pointed	 to	 the bracelet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Connie	studied	the	bracelet	for	a	second.	“Weren’t	you	down	at	the	docks	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">few	 days	 ago	 with	 Nancy	 Tate?	 I	 thought	 you	 weren’t	 allowed	 to	 be	 there	 if you’re	wearing	one	of	those.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nancy	 got	 me	 permission	 to	 be	 there.	 We	 were	 going	 through	 the	 mining ship	to	help	build	my	case.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	let	you	back	on	your	ship?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	a	tough	time,	too.	I	hated	reliving	the	events.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	meeting	with	the	apparition,”	Connie	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 recognized	 the	 statement	 as	 trying	 to	 draw	 out	 more	 information, although	 Connie	 was	 no	 longer	 taking	 notes.	 “Do	 you	 need	 me	 to	 go	 into	 that yet?	Like	I	said,	I’d	rather	wait	until	after	the	trial.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Connie	 smiled.	 “I	 want	 to	 hear	 as	 much	 as	 possible,	 because	 I	 assume	 you don’t	have	any	hard	evidence	I	can	use.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	shook	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Normally,	that	would	be	a	problem,”	Connie	said.	“Except,	and	I	need	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 keep	 quiet	 about	 this	 too,	 I’ve	 been	 told	 about	 other	 people	 seeing	 the	 same apparitions,	and	much	like	how	you	describe	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 noticed	 her	 own	 jaw	 had	 just	 dropped.	 She	 closed	 her	 mouth,	 thought about	what	Connie	said,	and	realized	it	shouldn’t	be	so	surprising.	If	these	beings existed	on	Titan,	and	they	had	already	taken	over	Richard	McLear,	why	wouldn’t other	humans	have	been	contacted? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	we	do,	then?”	Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 depends	 on	 what	 you	 tell	 me.	 I’m	 not	 just	 putting	 together	 a	 story,	 I’m trying	to	build	a	case	that	not	just	our	government,	but	humanity	must	react	to.	I like	the	idea	that	I’ll	be	the	one	who	presents	the	problem.	However,	I	think	it’s more	important	to	ensure	the	right	people	find	out	about	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	 are	 the	 right	 people?	 I	 spent	 the	 last	 few	 weeks	 trying	 to	 figure	 out who	I’d	call	first.	If	you	hadn’t	been	good	to	me	in	the	past,	I	might	have	gone	to the	constables.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>“And	 that’s	 the	 problem.	 Had	 you	 gone	 to	 the	 police,	 there	 might	 be someone	in	their	command	who’d	cover-up	everything.	That	can	easily	happen</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	governments	because	somebody	stands	to	lose	in	these	situations.	With	us, we	get	it	out	there,	and	the	people	force	the	issue	on	the	elected	officials.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	liked	the	sound	of	that,	and	it	made	her	happy	she	talked	to	Connie	first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	 Connie	 got	 the	 word	 out,	 the	 whole	 solar	 system	 would	 know	 they	 were not	alone,	and	it	wouldn’t	be	up	to	Pati	to	deal	with	it.	Primarily	because	she’d be	on	a	cruise	back	to	Earth.	“I’m	glad	I	came	here,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Connie	 nodded.	 “So,	 can	 we	 go	 over	 what	 happened	 on	 the	 mining	 ship?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 didn’t	 think	 in	 words,	 she	 thought	 in	 feelings,	 and	 the	 feelings	 were positive.	“Sure,	here’s	what	happened.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 had	 a	 great	 breakfast	 at	 the	 plaza.	 It	 contrasted	 with	 the	 trouble	 she	 had sleeping	the	night	before.	After	spilling	her	guts	to	Connie	Pearson,	she	walked home	 and	 locked	 the	 doors	 behind	 her.	 She	 set	 alarms	 to	 let	 her	 know	 if	 the oxygen	 in	 the	 apartment	 got	 too	 low,	 or	 if	 the	 power	 went	 out,	 or	 if	 an	 air contaminant	or	radiation	invaded	her	space. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	 alarms	 went	 off	 that	 night.	 However,	 any	 noise	 out	 of	 the	 ordinary	 had her	 jumping	 out	 of	 bed,	 ready	 to	 face	 whatever	 might	 try	 to	 harm	 her.	 The paranoia	robbed	her	of	a	half	night’s	sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	did	get	to	sleep,	and	then	slept	in	a	little	longer,	telling	the	alarms	to	wait until	 the	 last	 minute.	 There	 was	 only	 enough	 time	 to	 dress	 and	 take	 the	 trolley down	 to	 the	 Grand	 Center.	 She’d	 overcome	 her	 fear	 of	 the	 trolley,	 except	 she wouldn’t	stand	on	the	edge	of	the	platform	when	waiting	to	board. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	breakfast,	she	strode	to	Nancy’s	office.	They	had	more	work	to	prepare</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	the	settlement	conference	with	Jack	Reagan,	and	Pati	felt	ready	to	get	to	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	was	going	according	to	Nancy’s	plan,	if	not	always	smooth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Soon,	 she	 was	 outside	 Nancy’s	 office	 door.	 She	 knocked,	 unlike	 what	 Joe Tate	did	yesterday. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	in,”	Nancy	said	through	the	intercom.	Pati	noticed	her	voice	seemed</p>
<p class="calibre1">harsh.	However,	Pati	did	as	Nancy	invited	and	walked	through	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy’s	 expression	 looked	 even	 harsher	 than	 her	 voice	 had	 been.	 Pati</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>approached	her	desk	and	stood	by	the	chair	she	usually	sat	in.	“What’s	wrong?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 for	 starters,”	 Nancy	 said,	 “the	 Titan	 News	 Network	 is	 reporting	 you had	a	visit	from	extraterrestrials.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	decided	she’d	wait	till	later	to	kick	Connie	Pearson’s	ass.	Nancy	fumed,	and right	now,	she	was	the	most	important	person	in	Pati’s	life.	She	sat	down	in	the chair.	“Nancy,	I’m	sorry,	I	didn’t	expect	this	to	get	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	least	there’s	that.	But,	Pati,	how	can	I	say	this	best,”	she	stopped	to	take a	breath.		Nancy	looked	to	the	side	and	took	another	breath,	and	then	stared	right back	at	Pati.	“This	is	serious,	woman!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I,	I,	uh,	Nancy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	want	from	me?	I’m	busting	my	ass	for	you,	and	this	is	war.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	the	enemy	beaten,	and	you	just	gave	him	more	ammo	to	keep	fighting.	Don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	understand,	we	have	to	have	the	discipline	to	win	this,	and	that	includes	not talking	to	reporters	about	anything	that	doesn’t	help	our	case?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	Nancy,	so	what	do	we	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know,	Pati,	these	people	here	on	Titan	have	kept	capital	punishment	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	sentence	option.	Since	you’ve	killed	four	people,	which	Jack	Reagan	will	point out	 is	 three	 more	 than	 anyone	 else	 ever	 in	 the	 Saturnian	 system,	 we	 have to	consider	that	as	a	possible	outcome.	And	the	only	way	you	get	home	then	is	if your	family	pays	to	transport	your	body.	You	get	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	looked	up,	exhaled.	“Oh	shit,”	she	said	in	her	next	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 your	 existence	 is	 on	 the	 line.	 How-bad-do-you-want-to-live?	 That needs	to	be	your	thought	process.	There	is	nothing	so	important	that	you	should let	it	threaten	your	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	all	true,	though,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe,	 maybe	 not.	 Unfortunately,	 the	 news	 report	 is	 an	 admissible</p>
<p class="calibre1">statement	 that	 has	 no	 basis	 in	 verifiable	 facts.	 You	 might	 be	 right,	 but	 there’s nothing	you	can	hand	me	that	supports	what	you	said	to	the	reporter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 sat	 back,	 and	 her	 expression	 softened.	 “Okay,	 now	 that	 I’ve	 gotten that	 off	 my	 chest,	 let	 me	 tell	 you	 what	 I	 thought	 about	 after	 deciding	 how	 I’d bitch	you	out	for	what	you	did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>“Please,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	 I	 said	 before,	 I	 think	 we	 settle	 with	 Jack	 Reagan	 this	 afternoon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	 the	 hammering	 your	 credibility	 took	 with	 the	 media	 report,	 we’ll	 still carry	the	day	if	he	wants	to	get	in	front	of	the	JJ.	I’ve	written	up	a	final	argument that	 negates	 anything	 he’s	 brought	 forward	 so	 far.	 If	 he	 wants	 to	 bring	 in anything	new,	he	needs	to	have	already	forwarded	us	that	information.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	only	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	get	a	good	night’s	rest?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 didn’t	 you	 hear,	 I	 got	 pushed	 onto	 the	 tracks	 at	 the	 Grand	 Center station?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	heard	you	came	out	okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	but	someone	tried	to	kill	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	that	would	be	hard	to	do	since	you’re	Earth-born.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	still	could	have	happened	if	I	didn’t	jump	out	of	the	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	but.”	Nancy	took	a	breath.	“Okay,	I	see	what	you	mean.	I	will	not	say</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re	seeing	shadows,	just	for	now,	keep	quiet	about	it.	Watching	your	back	is never	a	bad	idea,	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	like	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	need	you	to	keep	your	head	low	until	after	we	settle.	Or,	the	latest,	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thursday	after	we	beat	Jack	Reagan	in	court.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	shook	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pati,	you’ll	be	fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 seemed	 confident.	 Pati	 normally	 would	 feel	 fine	 with	 that	 look.	 Too many	odd	accidents	had	happened,	though,	and	her	paranoia	ebbed	and	flowed</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 her	 mood.	 If	 she	 was	 logical	 about	 it,	 she’d	 assume	 these	 accidents	 were random	 chance,	 except	 there	 was	 something	 personal	 about	 each	 one.	 And seeing	those	apparitions	didn’t	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	want	to	stay	here	till	we	go	see	Jack	Reagan?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	we	have	to	finish	preparing	anyway?”	Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	not	really,	I’ve	got	all	I	need.	We	can	work	on	it	some	more	if	that	will make	you	feel	better.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	that’ll	help.”	She	stood	up.	“I’ll	go	home	and	change	clothes</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	the	settlement	conference.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	not	till	this	afternoon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	walk.	It’s	harder	for	accidents	to	happen	that	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	 you	 think	 that’s	 best.”	 Nancy	 got	 up	 and	 escorted	 her	 to	 the	 door.	 Pati walked	into	the	hallway,	and	Nancy	shut	the	door	behind	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a>*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 stood	 outside	 the	 conference	 room	 door	 in	 a	 brilliantly	 lit	 hallway	 with brown	walls,	darker-brown	doors,	and	no	windows.	These	negotiations	would	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">both	 confidential	 and	 recorded,	 so	 they	 wouldn’t	 use	 the	 rooms	 they’d	 already used.	She	hoped	it	would	be	the	last	conference	room	she	saw	on	Titan.	Just	like she	hoped	she’d	never	step	foot	into	the	courts	building	ever	again,	and	just	like she	hoped	she’d	never	see	Titan	again	in	a	few	months. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	walk	back	to	her	apartment	did	nothing	to	dissuade	her	from	leaving	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">soon	as	possible.	Where	before,	it	was	just	a	few	people	who	stared	and	turned away	 as	 she	 looked	 back.	 After	 the	 news	 report	 from	 last	 night,	 she	 took	 the center	of	attention	no	matter	where	she	walked.	She	tried	to	take	the	train,	just	to hurry	 the	 process,	 and	 teenagers	 on	 the	 platform	 taunted	 the	 “alien-lady.”	 The thought	 made	 Pati	 clutch	 her	 fists,	 so	 she	 took	 a	 deep	 breath.	 She	 had	 to	 calm down	and	focus	on	the	task	ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 straightened	 out	 the	 black	 business	 suit	 Nancy	 had	 picked	 out	 for	 her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything	 else	 to	 this	 point	 was	 preliminary.	 Now	 it	 was	 crunch	 time.	 Nancy wanted	 Pati	 to	 dress	 for	 the	 occasion	 because	 a	 lack	 of	 respect	 for	 the prosecutors	would	weigh	against	a	defendant,	and	dressing	professionally	was	a defense	against	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 heard	 Nancy’s	 voice	 down	 the	 hall,	 and	 soon	 she	 approached,	 wearing her	brown	business	suit	and	carrying	her	black	briefcase.	“You	doing	all	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 good,	 just	 wondering	 what	 it’ll	 be	 like	 traveling	 with	 the	 rich	 and famous	back	to	Earth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’s	the	settlement	going,	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 had	 a	 message	 from	 Joel	 Chevelde.	 He	 sent	 me	 a	 proposal	 from	 the McLears.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent,	what’s	he	think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	thinks	it	sucks.	It	blew	my	socks	off,	though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	can	be	greedy	when	he	wants	to	be.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don’t	think	I	should	listen	to	him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	you	should.	I	meant	greedy	in	a	good	way,	in	how	he	fights	for	a	client. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 you’re	 happy	 with	 what	 they’re	 offering,	 and	 he	 thinks	 he	 can	 get	 more,	 tell him	to	counteroffer	and	see	what	they	say.	Since	I	don’t	expect	you	want	half	the company,	and	you	don’t	want	a	big	fight,	tell	him	to	accept	whatever	they	come</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>back	with.	Take	the	money	and	run.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	like	the	sound	of	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thought	 you	 would,	 but	 first,	 we	 have	 to	 get	 you	 from	 under	 your</p>
<p class="calibre1">responsibility	to	the	state.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,	so	how	are	you	feeling?”	Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	shrugged.	“I’m	all	right.	Not	a	lot	of	sleep	last	night.	I	watched	video until	 I	 passed	 out.	 That’s	 how	 I	 found	 out	 about	 you	 talking	 with	 Connie Pearson.”	She	nodded	to	the	door	Pati	stood	next	to.	“Ready?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	let’s	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	opened	the	door	and	led	Pati	in.	The	room	was	small	for	conferences, </p>
<p class="calibre1">although	it	only	held	a	small	table	with	two	seats	on	each	side.	There	were	video screens	on	both	ends,	while	the	wall	with	the	door	and	opposite	were	flat-white with	 no	 ornaments.	 Nancy	 walked	 to	 the	 seats	 opposite	 the	 door	 and	 took	 one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	took	the	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	opened	her	briefcase	with	the	hinges	facing	where	Jack	Reagan	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">sit.	Then	she	pulled	out	her	tablet	and	placed	it	next	to	the	briefcase.	She	started tapping	the	screen	when	a	knock	on	the	door	was	heard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	in,”	Nancy	said,	without	taking	her	attention	from	the	tablet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	Reagan	stepped	in,	followed	by	another	male;	both	were	wearing	black</p>
<p class="calibre1">suits.	 “Good	 morning,”	 he	 said.	 His	 expression	 was	 stern,	 and	 he	 did	 not	 have the	look	of	someone	who	wanted	to	chat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 nodded.	 Neither	 entrant	 looked	 at	 Pati,	 so	 she	 decided	 not	 to	 greet them.	Jack	Reagan	and	this	guy	were	her	enemies,	and	if	they	gave	her	no	reason to	be	courteous	to	them,	so	much	the	better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 took	 the	 seats	 opposite	 of	 Nancy	 and	 Pati,	 with	 the	 tall,	 black-suited male	sitting	across	from	Pati.	He	carried	in	a	black	briefcase	and	placed	it	on	the floor	where	Pati	couldn’t	see	it.	He	pulled	out	an	electronic	device	and	placed	it on	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	Harry	Meldrom,	he’ll	be	assisting	me	today,”	Jack	Reagan	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pleased	 to	 meet	 you,	 Harry,”	 Nancy	 said	 as	 she	 extended	 her	 hand	 across the	table.	He	was	obviously	of	European	descent,	pale	with	light-brown	hair.	He also	 looked	 older	 than	 Jack	 Reagan.	 Maybe	 in	 his	 middle-forties,	 adjusted	 for life	on	Titan,	because	he	seemed	too	tall	to	be	from	Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	 took	 Nancy’s	 hand,	 “Yes,	 Ms.	 Tate,	 I’m	 happy	 to	 be	 working	 with you,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	now	glanced	at	Pati	and	nodded,	as	if	he’d	just	been	given	permission</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	say	hello.	Jack	Reagan	also	nodded	but	immediately	turned	his	attention	to	his own	briefcase	set	across	from	Nancy.	He	pulled	out	a	tablet,	set	his	briefcase	on the	 floor,	 and	 returned	 his	 attention	 to	 Nancy.	 “Harry	 will	 be	 taking	 additional</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a>recordings	for	state	purposes,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	right	ahead,”	Nancy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,	 then	 I’d	 like	 to	 call	 this	 settlement	 conference	 to	 order.	 This	 is	 Jack Reagan	and	Harry	Meldrom	negotiating	for	the	state,”	he	said.	In	response,	Pati heard	 the	 recording	 mechanism	 confirm	 activation.	 While	 all	 the	 previous settlement	 conferences	 were	 confidential,	 the	 final	 settlement	 conference would	be	recorded	to	determine	if	one	side	was	purposely	refusing	to	settle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 is	 Nancy	 Tate,	 counsel	 for	 Pati	 Lynch,	 who	 is	 also	 in	 attendance,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	would	like	to	reference	the	last	hearing,”	Jack	Reagan	said,	“and	despite</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 results	 tabulated,	 the	 state	 feels	 confident	 a	 labor	 sentence	 of	 ten	 years	 is appropriate	to	protect	the	public	from	a	repeat	offender.	This	sentence	will	also allow	the	defendant	time	to	rehabilitate	to	a	behavior	that	will	be	supportive	of the	common	good	rather	than	a	habitual	tendency	towards	violence	that	has	been documented	and	presented	as	evidence.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 felt	 her	 face	 turn	 red.	 Ten	 years	 on	 an	 ice-miner!	 Jack	 Reagan	 should drug-tested	for	suggesting	that	kind	of	sentence.	That	bastard	wasn’t	on	the	ship with	 her;	 he	 wasn’t	 the	 one	 Bruno	 attacked	 and	 tried	 to	 kill.	 He	 never	 spent	 a moment	with	the	twins.	Never	experienced	a	situation	where,	had	he	stepped	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	wrong	direction,	he	might	be	fatally	injured,	only	to	see	the	twins	watching him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy’s	 right	 hand	 lightly	 grabbed	 Pati’s	 left	 forearm,	 nonverbally	 telling Pati	 to	 settle	 down.	 Pati	 took	 a	 deep	 breath	 and	 turned	 her	 attention	 from	 Jack Reagan	to	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 state’s	 characterization	 of	 my	 client	 is	 borderline	 unethical,”	 Nancy said.	 Jack	 Reagan	 started	 to	 respond,	 and	 when	 Nancy	 held	 up	 her	 hand,	 he stopped.	 “My	 client	 suffered	 a	 traumatic	 event,”	 she	 continued.	 “One	 she	 is forced	 to	 recall,	 time	 and	 time	 again,	 because	 the	 state,	 without	 evidence, continues	 to	 insist	 that	 her	 actions	 met	 the	 definition	 of	 murder.	 And	 yet, centuries	 of	 legal	 proceedings	 of	 this	 type	 have	 affirmed,	 time	 and	 again,	 that actions	taken	in	self-defense	do	not	meet	that	definition.	As	of	today,	my	client has	provided	all	the	evidence	needed	to	sustain	a	self-defense	argument,	and	the state	has	not	provided	a	shred	of	evidence	to	contradict	her	testimony.	So,	while we	have	no	issue	with	the	state	offering	an	unrealistic	sentence	at	the	beginning of	negotiations,	we	maintain	the	characterization	of	my	client	is	uncalled	for	and counterproductive	to	reaching	a	settlement.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 state	 is	 interested	 in	 settling	 this	 murder	 trial,”	 he	 said.	 “But	 it	 also must	 be	 cognizant	 of	 the	 character	 of	 the	 defendant	 and	 allowing	 violent criminals	 to	 walk	 the	 streets	 of	 Karakorum	 can	 mean	 we’ll	 be	 back	 here	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>another	year	trying	a	new	case.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 put	 her	 hand	 on	 Pati’s	 arm	 again	 and	 stood	 up.	 “Your</p>
<p class="calibre1">mischaracterization	of	my	client	is	not	facilitating	a	settlement.”	Nancy	put	her tablet	 back	 into	 her	 briefcase	 and	 closed	 it.	 “We	 can	 leave	 now.	 I	 have	 no problem	maintaining	that	you	did	not	come	here	for	settlement	purposes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Counselor,	I	am	only	answering	why	I	have	proposed	the	terms	I	have,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	far	as	what	you	call,	‘characterization,’	every	word	I	used	in	reference	to	your client	 is	 verified	 by	 events.	 A	 criminal	 is	 a	 person	 convicted	 of	 a	 crime,	 which your	 client	 was.	 A	 violent	 criminal	 is	 a	 person	 convicted	 of	 a	 violent	 crime, which	your—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 pointed	 her	 finger	 at	 Jack	 Reagan.	 “I	 don’t	 disagree	 that	 your language	can	be	theoretically	correct.	However,	if	you	wish	to	reach	a	settlement for	 this	 case,	 you	 do	 not	 start	 by	 insulting	 the	 defendant.	 You	 started	 this negotiation	 by	 referencing	 the	 score	 tabulated	 in	 the	 last	 hearing.	 Let	 me reference	it	as	well	and	point	out	that	as	it	stands,	my	client	would	not	receive	a sentence	 as	 harsh	 as	 the	 one	 you	 just	 proposed.	 Explain	 how	 you	 intend	 to negotiate	in	good	faith	when	you	begin	with	that	proposal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	Reagan’s	face	remained	unmoved	during	Nancy’s	speech,	and	when	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">apparently	 finished,	 he	 folded	 his	 arms	 and	 sat	 back.	 “The	 score	 could	 still	 go higher.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	 down	 to	 closing	 arguments.	 I	 know	 what	 you	 will	 say,	 and	 I	 have rebuttals	 for	 every	 point	 you	 might	 make.	 I	 even	 have	 rebuttals	 for	 points	 you cannot	make.	I’ve	done	this	before,	and	I	know	my	client	will	walk	free	after	the JJ	runs	a	score.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s	the	possibility	additional	evidence	will	present	itself,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you’re	wasting	the	state’s	money	on	the	possibility	that	evidence	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">present	 itself,”	 Nancy	 said.	 She	 picked	 up	 her	 briefcase.	 “I	 now	 maintain	 that you	 have	 not	 negotiated	 in	 good	 faith	 and	 we’ll	 let	 that	 data	 be	 added	 for	 the final	hearing.	Let’s	go,	Pati.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	stood	up	and	followed	her	to	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	 do	 one-year	 labor	 with	 limited	 confinement,”	 Jack	 Reagan	 said	 before Nancy	opened	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stopped	and	beckoned	Pati	to	follow	her	back	to	their	seats.	Once	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 seated,	 she	 took	 her	 tablet	 out	 and	 tapped	 a	 few	 buttons	 before	 setting	 it next	to	her	briefcase	again.	“One-month	confinement	with	bracelet	monitoring,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	countered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	wanted	to	hit	Nancy	until	she	thought	about	it.	It	would	be	longer	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	 till	 she	 could	 get	 on	 a	 short	 cruise	 back	 home,	 and	 she’d	 seen	 everything she	could	on	Titan,	anyway.	Why	not? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>“A	year	with	no	confinement,”	he	replied	to	Nancy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	 not	 talking	 years,	 and	 I’m	 not	 going	 for	 more	 than	 two	 months. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’ll	be	leaving	Titan	in	that	amount	of	time,	and	you’ve	modified	settlements before	with	that	stipulation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	absolutely	intend	for	her	to	leave	Titan,”	Jack	Reagan	said.	“Preferably	as part	of	the	repatriation	program.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guy	next	to	him	laughed,	shaking	his	head.	“You	sure	she	deserves	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">that?”	Harry	Meldrom	mused. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre3">Stupid	 punk, </i>	 Pati	 thought.	 If	 he	 didn’t	 shut	 up,	 she’d	 do	 more	 than	 think about	his	stupidity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	Reagan	smiled,	“Harry,	come	on,	we’re	trying	to	settle	here.”. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,	 Jack,	 quit	 kidding	 around,”	 he	 said	 and	 waved	 dismissively	 at	 Pati. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 convict	 is	 trying	 to	 escape	 justice	 by	 pleading	 self-defense.	 They	 will	 all lie,	cheat,	steal,	do	whatever	it	takes	to	literally	get	away	with	murder.	She	killed three	guys	who	she	was	supposed	to	see	through	their	own	sentences.	Now	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">comes	 up	 with	 some	 story	 about	 how	 they	 mutinied—how	 convenient—</p>
<p class="calibre1">especially	when	she’s	the	first	prison	ship	commander	to	have	a	mutiny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shut	him	up,”	Nancy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	had	had	enough,	and	Nancy’s	hand	was	on	her	arm	again.	This	time,	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t	hold	her	temper.	She	stood	up	and	reached	over	with	her	right	arm.	Harry Meldrom	did	not	wear	his	collar	buttoned,	and	it	gave	her	a	good	point	to	grab. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 face	 turned	 fierce	 as	 she	 grabbed	 him,	 and	 he	 grabbed	 her	 arm,	 but	 he couldn’t	stop	her	from	dragging	him	onto	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop	your	client	now,	or	I’ll	be	forced	to,”	Jack	Reagan	said.	Pati	couldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">care	less.	She	was	going	to	teach	this	punk	a	lesson	and	switched	her	grip	to	get her	right	hand	free.	He	tried	to	sit	up	and	get	away;	Pati	pushed	him	back	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	definitely	a	Titan-born,	big	and	nasty	looking,	all	marshmallow	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	done	insulting	me,	asshole,”	Pati	said,	as	she	brought	her	right	hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	to	punch	him.	Then	she	blacked	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 woke	 up	 in	 a	 prison	 cell,	 laying	 on	 a	 cot,	 and	 feeling	 a	 massive headache. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	didn’t	make	my	job	any	easier,”	she	heard	Nancy	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a><b class="calibre2">9	The	Final	Trial</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	courtroom	looked	the	same,	and	Pati	took	her	usual	seat.	Nancy	had	joked</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 they	 might	 as	 well	 put	 Pati’s	 name	 on	 the	 defendant’s	 chair,	 but	 that	 was after	the	second	JJ	ruling	when	it	looked	like	walking	free	was	a	given. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today,	Pati	worried	but	was	not	scared.	Nancy	said	the	worst	case	should	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	 more	 than	 living	 on	 Titan	 a	 few	 more	 years,	 although	 that	 was	 bad	 because she	had	to	wear	a	disguise	just	to	get	to	the	courtroom	without	being	abused	for being	 the	 “alien-lady,”	 as	 the	 teenagers	 labeled	 her.	 Regardless,	 it	 would probably	blow	over	after	a	few	months,	and	she	could	live	a	normal	life	until	she could	 leave.	 Better	 would	 be	 to	 walk	 out	 of	 here	 today,	 and	 on	 the	 first	 cruise ship	back	to	Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 no	 longer	 worried	 about	 being	 sent	 back	 in	 the	 repatriation	 program. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following	her	attack	on	Harry	Meldrom,	Nancy	took	her	on	a	tour	of	the	ships</p>
<p class="calibre1">built	for	just	such	a	trip.	This	included	the	hallway	connected	to	this	courtroom, each	dock	door	leading	to	the	ships,	and	they	even	entered	one	of	the	ships.	Pati took	notes	during	the	tour,	and	despite	Nancy’s	confidence,	she	decided	then	to have	a	Plan	B. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	wore	a	business	casual	suit.	Tan	slacks	with	a	blue	blouse	that	fit	loosely at	 the	 wrists.	 Nancy	 wanted	 her	 to	 wear	 the	 black	 business	 suit.	 Pati	 had	 other ideas.	She	needed	to	be	ready	to	deal	with	anything	that	could	happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 sat	 next	 to	 her	 in	 the	 courtroom,	 going	 through	 notes	 on	 her	 tablet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’d	committed	the	final	statements	to	a	document	ready	for	upload	to	the	JJ. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	also	would	say	a	few	words	to	support	the	document,	an	act	expected	to	gain another	point	or	two	in	Pati’s	favor.	Pati	thought	she	was	making	the	statement more	to	antagonize	Jack	Reagan,	which	was	fine	by	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 looked	 over	 at	 him.	 He	 also	 was	 busy	 reviewing	 documents	 on	 his tablet,	and	the	minion	who	taunted	her	into	pummeling	him	sat	at	the	other	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 still	 about	 five	 minutes	 before	 noon	 when	 the	 trial	 started,	 so whatever	he	had	up	his	sleeve,	it	better	be	good	because	Jack	Reagan	had	played all	his	cards.	When	this	was	all	over,	hopefully,	he’d	have	his	position	reviewed and	 knocked	 down	 a	 few	 notches	 for	 dragging	 this	 trial	 out.	 If	 that	 was unrealistic,	she’d	settle	for	a	pissed-off	look	because	she	was	walking	out	a	free person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	scanned	the	courtroom;	it	was	a	little	more	crowded	than	in	the	previous</p>
<p class="calibre1">hearings.	 Bruno’s	 family	 was	 here	 again,	 and	 his	 mom	 still	 looked	 like	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>wanted	 blood.	 Pati	 wondered	 how	 she’d	 feel	 if	 someone	 had	 killed	 her	 child, whether	the	circumstances	were	warranted	or	not.	Maybe	being	a	mother	meant</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	had	to	check	part	of	your	discretion	at	the	door	when	it	came	to	your	kids.	A thought	that	made	her	think	of	her	own	mother,	and	how	much	better	life	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	when	she	could	be	with	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	decided	reminiscing	about	family	would	have	to	wait	till	after	the	trial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	continued	to	scan	the	courtroom	and	noted	there	were	a	few	reporters,	none being	 Connie	 Pearson.	 That	 was	 good	 because	 after	 how	 the	 people	 of Karakorum	taunted	her,	Pati	might	not	be	able	to	control	herself.	Connie	had	all but	 given	 her	 word	 the	 story	 would	 not	 come	 out	 until	 after	 the	 trial,	 and	 she couldn’t	 even	 wait	 a	 few	 hours	 before	 broadcasting.	 Pati	 reviewed	 the	 crowd once	 more,	 making	 sure	 Connie	 wasn’t	 sitting	 in	 a	 regular	 seat	 outside	 of	 the press	box.	While	scanning,	she	saw	the	courtroom	door	open,	and	he	walked	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kerry	McLear,	maybe	the	most	powerful	man	in	the	solar	system,	if	not	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wealthiest,	walked	through	the	door	with	his	bodyguard	and	assistant.	Pati	knew them	 all	 from	 her	 marriage	 to	 Richard,	 and	 despite	 that	 fact	 of	 relation,	 Kerry never	looked	in	her	direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 remembered	 his	 resemblance	 to	 Richard,	 the	 same	 brownish	 hair	 with some	gray	in	it,	although	Kerry	wasn’t	balding	like	Richard	was.	He	was	taller too,	 easily	 over	 two	 meters.	 Pati	 knew	 he	 spent	 most	 of	 his	 time	 on	 Picus managing	the	factories,	which	would	normally	make	him	unable	to	live	in	even</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 one-sixth	 gravity	 of	 Titan.	 She	 also	 knew	 that	 he	 had	 a	 private	 gravity-treatment	 facility	 to	 keep	 him	 in	 shape	 for	 his	 visits	 to	 Earth.	 He	 had	 it	 all physically,	 both	 the	 size	 and	 bone	 density.	 Nobody	 would	 kill	 him	 with	 one punch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 Reagan	 turned	 when	 he	 heard	 the	 gasps	 from	 the	 crowd.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediately	stood	and	turned	toward	Kerry.	“Mr.	McLear,	we	didn’t	expect	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">presence.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kerry	led	his	two-man	entourage	to	a	trio	of	unoccupied	seats	near	the	front. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 I	 didn’t	 forward	 a	 notification,	 Mr.	 Reagan.	 I’m	 simply	 here	 as	 a	 private citizen	to	observe	our	justice	system,”	Kerry	said.	The	seat	he	took	was	two	rows behind	 Jack	 Reagan	 and	 had	 empty	 seats	 on	 both	 sides	 for	 his	 bodyguard	 and assistant.	 They	 took	 the	 seats,	 the	 bodyguard	 scanning	 the	 room,	 and	 the assistant	working	on	a	tablet.	Kerry	just	sat	there	as	if	waiting	for	a	stage	play	or movie	to	begin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	 you	 for	 your	 participation,	 Mr.	 McLear,”	 Jack	 Reagan	 said.	 Pati suspected	he	was	kissing	up	to	Kerry.	Kerry	was	not	officially	part	of	the	legal system	 in	 the	 Saturnian	 system.	 However,	 his	 family	 could	 influence	 how	 tax revenues	were	spent.	Should	today’s	event	not	go	according	to	Kerry’s	desires, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a>Jack	Reagan	could	be	out	of	a	job. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 didn’t	 make	 sense,	 though.	 Why	 would	 he	 be	 here,	 when	 there	 would	 be millions	 of	 other	 tasks	 vying	 for	 his	 attention?	 He	 did	 not	 attempt	 to	 influence the	 settlement	 negotiations	 for	 killing	 his	 brother,	 why	 now?	 Even	 if	 he	 could influence	 the	 proceedings	 by	 his	 attendance,	 Jack	 Reagan	 no	 longer	 could	 do much	to	affect	the	outcome.	The	JJ	would	render	the	score	based	on	the	previous data	 uploaded,	 and	 Nancy’s	 final	 statement.	 Also,	 Kerry	 could	 have	 sent	 a minion	to	influence	the	trial	before	now,	so	why	waste	his	valuable	time,	which could	literally	be	measured	in	gold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 now	 12	 p.m.,	 and	 I	 call	 the	 proceedings	 to	 order,”	 Jack	 Reagan	 said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Counselor,”	he	said	to	Nancy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	 you,”	 she	 said.	 She	 stood	 up	 from	 her	 chair	 and	 proceeded	 to	 the podium	 in	 front	 of	 the	 JJ	 screen.	 For	 the	 next	 five	 minutes,	 she	 uploaded	 her final	statement	into	the	JJ.	When	she	finished,	she	stood	at	the	podium	and	took a	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 final	 data	 for	 my	 client’s	 defense	 has	 been	 uploaded.	 Before	 we	 have the	computers	render	a	final	decision,	I	would	like	to	say	a	few	words.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 were	 a	 few	 murmurs	 from	 the	 crowd	 behind	 Pati.	 Bruno’s	 family probably	 wasn’t	 happy,	 and	 maybe	 a	 few	 others	 who	 were	 eager	 to	 see	 the results.	They’d	have	to	suck	it	up	since	it	wasn’t	their	necks	on	the	line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 trial	 has	 gone	 too	 far,”	 she	 began.	 “As	 a	 public	 defendant,	 I	 have	 to ensure	people	accused	of	crimes	are	not	wrongly	convicted	because	they	do	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 the	 resources	 to	 defend	 themselves	 against	 the	 state,	 who	 regularly,	 is trying	 to	 incarcerate	 people.	 In	 this	 trial,	 we	 see	 the	 state	 prolonging	 the inevitable	 on	 the	 basis	 that	 the	 accusation	 is	 so	 extreme	 that	 every	 opportunity for	them	to	collect	evidence	must	be	granted.	That	they	have,	through	the	use	of questionable	 tactics,	 extended	 the	 trial	 to	 this	 date	 makes	 it	 a	 matter	 of questionable	 ethics.	 Because,	 in	 this	 extended	 timeframe,	 the	 state	 has	 not	 yet provided	a	single	scrap	of	evidence	to	disprove	any	of	my	client’s	statements	of fact.	 Therefore,	 the	 prosecutors	 acting	 for	 the	 state	 should	 consider	 themselves unethical.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 looked	 at	 Jack	 Reagan	 and	 his	 minion.	 Jack	 looked	 upset,	 and	 the minion	 was	 turning	 red.	 Was	 Nancy	 trying	 to	 goad	 them	 into	 doing	 something stupid?	If	so,	Pati	certainly	approved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We,	the	people	of	Titan,	utilize	the	electronic	means	of	judgment	because	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	inability	to	find	an	unbiased	jury	of	peers	in	a	civilization	with	such	a	small population.	When	used	properly,	it	has	been	a	significant	resource	saver	as	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,	in	such	situations	as	we	find	ourselves	today,	unscrupulous	attorneys can	try	to	manipulate	the	system	to	get	results	that	benefit	them	personally,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>justice	be	damned.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 didn’t	 look	 at	 the	 prosecutors	 this	 time,	 which	 was	 probably	 good because	she	couldn’t	wipe	the	smile	off	her	face,	and	that	might	be	pushing	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“However,	 what’s	 done	 is	 done.	 The	 actions	 of	 the	 state	 can	 be	 addressed, and	 fortunately	 will	 not	 affect	 the	 outcome	 of	 this	 trial.	 The	 Defense	 will	 now rest,”	Nancy	said.	She	walked	from	behind	the	podium	and	back	to	her	seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 now	 took	 a	 quick	 look	 at	 Jack	 Reagan	 and	 his	 minion,	 and	 they	 still looked	upset.	She	turned	back	to	Nancy	after	she	sat	back	down.	“Now	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	like	my	backhanded	attack	on	Jack	Reagan?”	Nancy	asked	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	brilliant;	they	didn’t	jump	over	the	table	and	attack	you,	though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	couldn’t	expect	that	much.	I	just	wanted	to	get	it	on	the	record	that	their behavior	 in	 this	 trial	 needs	 to	 be	 looked	 at.	 Having	 Kerry	 McLear	 here	 only helps.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that	why	he’s	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don’t	 have	 a	 clue	 why	 he’s	 here.	 You	 were	 related	 to	 him.	 Why	 do	 you think	he’s	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	been	beating	my	brain	since	he	walked	in	and	I	still	can’t	come	up	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 good	 answer.	 I	 never	 really	 knew	 him	 because	 he	 lived	 on	 Picus	 most	 of	 the time	I	was	married	to	Richard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	he	has	business	here	today?	And	he’s	only	a	spectator?”	Nancy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	never	been	a	spectator,”	Pati	said.	“If	it’s	business	hours,	he’s	all	about business.	He	used	to	send	Richard	nasty	messages	for	not	being	at	work,	and…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	noticed	she	no	longer	had	Nancy’s	attention.	She	turned	and	looked	at	Jack Reagan,	 who	 had	 a	 disgusted	 look	 on	 his	 face.	 She	 returned	 her	 attention	 to Nancy,	who	seemed	pleased	that	Jack	Reagan	was	so	discomforted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	done,”	Nancy	said	to	Jack	Reagan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 Reagan	 returned	 his	 attention	 to	 his	 tablet.	 Pati	 looked	 back	 at	 Nancy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	we’re	good?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 comfortable,”	 she	 said.	 “The	 arguments	 I	 uploaded	 contradict	 every assertion	he’s	made	and	negate	anything	he’s	tried	to	allege.	It’s	all	about	smoke and	 mirrors	 for	 them,	 and	 I	 just	 shot	 a	 laser	 beam	 right	 through	 it.	 They’ll	 be lucky	they	don’t	get	carted	off	for	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	nodded.	She	sat	back	in	her	chair	facing	the	JJ	screen.	A	few	moments</p>
<p class="calibre1">later,	Jack	Reagan	stood	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 state	 will	 proceed	 with	 the	 final	 ruling,”	 he	 said.	 Pati	 then	 heard	 the courtroom	door	open	behind	her.	She	didn’t	turn,	even	though	she	saw	it	caught Jack	 Reagan’s	 attention.	 It	 was	 enough	 to	 stop	 him	 from	 talking,	 and	 he continued	to	stare	at	who	walked	in,	so	Pati	looked. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a>It	was	the	engineer	who	had	been	working	on	her	mining	ship’s	records,	and he	held	in	his	left	hand	a	black	container	that	was	just	large	enough	to	contain	a data	storage	disk.	She	felt	a	chill	as	he	walked	directly	to	Jack	Reagan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 turned	 to	 greet	 the	 engineer,	 and	 they	 spoke	 words	 Pati	 couldn’t	 make out.	She	hoped	Jack	Reagan	would	be	thinking	about	cutting	his	losses	by	now, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 the	 changed	 look	 on	 his	 face	 displayed	 the	 same	 level	 of	 determination	 as she	saw	in	their	first	meeting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	like	this,”	Nancy	said.	She	stood	up,	“The	state	needs	to	wrap	up	this trial,”	she	said	aloud	to	the	courtroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 Reagan	 ignored	 her	 and	 continued	 to	 talk	 to	 the	 engineer.	 After	 a	 few more	sentences,	he	took	the	black	container	from	the	engineer.	Then,	he	looked at	Nancy,	“The	state	has	evidence	to	introduce,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	time	is	over	for	that,”	Nancy	replied.	“This	trial	has	dragged	out	long</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough.	Will	the	state	choose	to	retry	this	case	if	it	does	not	find	the	result	to	its liking?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	Reagan’s	face	tightened	in	anger.	He	looked	down	and	took	a	breath.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	 looked	 back	 at	 Nancy	 and	 held	 up	 the	 black	 container.	 “These	 are	 the restored	records	from	the	mining	ship.	It	should	verify	everything	your	client	has alleged	in	this	case.	I	can	upload	them	now,	and	if	what	your	client	has	alleged	is true,	then	it	should	be	favorable	to	your	case.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	about	jumped	out	of	her	chair.	Proof	of	everything	she’d	witnessed	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	that	black	container.	Everyone	could	see	she	had	to	kill	Bruno,	had	to	pull	the plug	on	the	twins,	and	had	faced	an	extraterrestrial	who	might	be	somewhere	in Karakorum.	It	was	her	ace	card,	and	it	made	certain	she’d	be	going	home	on	the next	ship	back	to	Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Defense	contests	admission	of	this	evidence,”	Nancy	declared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 held	 her	 breath.	 She	 held	 her	 hands,	 too,	 because	 she	 wanted	 to	 shake some	sense	into	her	attorney.	However,	she’d	spent	a	good	deal	of	time	trusting Nancy,	now	wasn’t	the	best	time	to	argue,	at	least	not	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	evidence	was	already	allowed,”	Jack	Reagan	said.	“The	ship’s	records</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 a	 part	 of	 this	 trial	 from	 the	 beginning,	 except	 they	 weren’t	 immediately available.	Because	they’re	available	now,	it	would	be	an	injustice	not	to	present them	because	they’re	an	absolute	presentation	of	the	facts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	the	Defense	must	have	sufficient	time	to	review	those	records	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	are	uploaded	for	consideration,”	Nancy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	long?”	Jack	Reagan	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	least	one	month,”	she	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 did	 not	 catch	 most	 of	 the	 conversation	 other	 than	 the	 one-month extension.	While	Nancy	and	Jack	Reagan	were	going	back	and	forth,	there	were</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>two	 teenagers	 with	 their	 parents	 behind	 her.	 Two	 girls,	 and	 Pati	 could	 not understand	why	they	would	be	here	because	they	weren’t	part	of	Bruno’s	family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	really	got	her,	though,	was	one	of	them	called	her	“alien-lady”	during	the legal	 haggling.	 It	 reminded	 her	 of	 how	 she’d	 been	 treated	 since	 yesterday,	 and what	 she	 might	 have	 to	 face	 here	 on	 Karakorum	 when	 she	 was	 released.	 She couldn’t	handle	one	more	month. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	Nancy,	I	can’t	wait	that	long,”	Pati	whispered	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	 got	 no	 choice,”	 Nancy	 said,	 also	 in	 a	 whisper.	 “You	 don’t	 know what’s	 on	 that	 disk,	 and	 no	 lawyer	 would	 let	 you	 face	 a	 JJ	 decision	 without knowing	 all	 the	 state’s	 evidence.	 Maybe	 it’s	 all	 good,	 and	 you’ll	 be	 fine,	 but	 I won’t	 let	 it	 happen	 because	 I	 would	 rightfully	 be	 thrown	 out	 of	 the	 legal profession.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	isn’t	about	you,	it’s	about	me,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,	and	you	can	wait	another	month.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	trial	will	go	on	after	you	review	the	records	and	probably	last	until	after the	next	ship	out	of	here.	If	you	can’t	work	faster,	we	need	to	take	the	chance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	not	enough	time	for	me	to	review	the	records.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	my	life,	Nancy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	sat	back	in	her	chair.	Pati	recognized	the	look	her	mother	would	give</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	if	she	was	about	to	get	into	trouble,	and	that	looked	pissed	her	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	it’s	your	life,”	she	said.	“But	as	your	representative	before	the	law,	the subject	 matter	 expert	 who	 is	 here	 to	 see	 that	 you	 do	 not	 make	 bad	 decisions based	on	ignorance	of	that	law,	I’m	telling	you,	that	you	must	wait.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	waiting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	not	going	to	do	anything	else	while	I’m	your	attorney,”	Nancy	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	loud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 stood	 and	 turned	 to	 Jack	 Reagan.	 “Can	 I	 overrule	 my	 counsel?”	 she asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 Reagan’s	 eyes	 got	 wide	 and	 then	 looked	 to	 the	 side.	 He	 put	 his	 right hand	to	his	chin,	seemed	to	think,	and	then	looked	back	at	Pati.	“Yes,	you	have that	 right,	 Ms.	 Lynch.	 However,	 the	 state	 doesn’t	 advise	 you	 to	 overrule	 your counsel	during	a	hearing,	especially	since	we	see	no	reason	why	the	one-month</p>
<p class="calibre1">recess	cannot	be	granted	for	a	review	of	the	records.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 know	 what	 happened	 on	 that	 ship,”	 she	 said.	 “Everyone,	 and	 especially, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘the	state,’	has	called	me	a	liar	about	what	that	happened	that	day.	Now,	I	have proof	to	back	me	up	and	I	want	everyone	to	see	it.”	Pati	sat	back	down	without breaking	eye	contact	with	Jack	Reagan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 Reagan	 took	 a	 deep	 breath.	 He	 looked	 back	 at	 Pati,	 “Ms.	 Lynch,	 I’m suggesting,	 and	 warning,	 that	 you	 follow	 your	 counsel’s	 advice.	 If	 you	 do	 not, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>the	state	will	contest	any	effort	to	appeal	the	decision.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	expect	an	appeal	is	your	plan	after	the	decision,”	Pati	said.	She	looked	at Nancy,	 who	 also	 looked	 at	 Jack	 Reagan.	 Apparently,	 she	 did	 not	 want	 to	 fight being	overruled,	which	was	fine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	Reagan	shrugged,	stood	up,	and	walked	to	the	podium.	He	had	the	black</p>
<p class="calibre1">container	in	his	hand,	and	once	there,	he	pulled	a	disk	out	of	it.	A	minute	later, he	returned	to	his	seat.	He	worked	with	his	tablet	for	a	minute	and	then	stood	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	display	evidence	just	uploaded,”	he	said	to	the	courtroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	sat	back.	The	room	darkened	slightly	and	the	JJ	screen	illuminated.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">next	 frame	 she	 saw	 was	 the	 bridge	 on	 her	 mining	 ship,	 with	 Bruno	 and	 her working	 at	 his	 station.	 It	 was	 the	 camera	 behind	 her	 command	 station,	 and	 it showed	her	standing	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	heard	Bruno’s	mother	let	out	a	low	sob	behind	her.	Hopefully,	after	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">viewing,	she	might	at	least	understand	what	happened,	although	forgiveness	was probably	asking	too	much.	Then	again,	what	was	there	to	forgive? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 Reagan	 spoke.	 “What	 these	 recordings	 will	 present	 is	 the	 moments	 of the	actual	incident.	What	happened	leading	up	to	the	incident	is	not	in	dispute; however,	what	you	will	see	could	be	contradictory	to	testimony	provided	by	the Defense.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	Pati	mumbled.	She	saw	the	time	displayed	at	the	upper	right	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">screen,	 and	 that	 was	 exactly	 the	 time	 before	 the	 apparition	 appeared.	 She	 was behind	 Bruno,	 watching	 him	 as	 he	 manipulated	 the	 life-support	 controls	 when she	watched	herself	slapping	Bruno	in	the	back	of	the	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 bitch!”	 Bruno’s	 mom	 said	 behind	 her,	 loud	 enough	 for	 the	 whole courtroom	to	hear.	Pati	ignored	it	and	watched	the	action	on-screen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	don’t	stop	hitting	me,	I	will	hit	back,	and	I	don’t	mean	with	just	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">fists,”	Bruno	yelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	threatening	me,”	Pati	on-screen	yelled	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	saying	I’m	going	to	defend	myself,”	he	yelled	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	in	her	seat	didn’t	like	it.	This	happened	weeks	before,	which	wasn’t	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">date	listed	on	the	screen.	Something	wasn’t	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 better	 watch	 your	 mouth,	 Bruno.	 I	 don’t	 have	 to	 endorse	 your	 parole when	we	get	back,	you	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	you	always	say	that.	But	I	won’t	let	you	get	away	with	hitting	me	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	time.	So,	shove	your	endorsement	up	your	ass!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati,	in	her	chair,	recognized	this	wasn’t	one	of	her	better	moments.	Maybe</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	state	was	showing	this	scene	before	the	actual	event	to	trash	her.	She	couldn’t understand	why	they’d	still	want	to	do	that,	when	the	actual	event	would	prove them	 wrong,	 anyway.	 Then	 she	 saw	 on-screen	 Pati	 push	 Bruno.	 And	 that,	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>remembered	for	a	fact,	did	not	happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	didn’t	stop	there.	It	showed	her	wrestling	with	him	on	the	ground	after	the attempted	 push.	 For	 a	 time,	 like	 the	 real	 thing,	 it	 showed	 Bruno	 on	 top	 of	 her, punching	 her	 in	 the	 back	 of	 the	 head.	 Then,	 he	 got	 to	 his	 feet	 and	 stood	 a	 few paces	from	her.	On-screen	Pati	got	up,	she	walked	the	two	paces,	and	punched</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bruno	in	the	throat,	while	he	did	nothing	to	defend	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	a	lie!”	Pati	screamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	state	requests	the	Defense	refrain	from	comment	until	the	presentation</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	complete,”	Jack	Reagan	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 complied.	 Next,	 she	 watched	 how	 she	 pulled	 the	 plug	 on	 the	 twins without	her	attempting	to	deal	with	them	or	showing	how	her	own	life-support</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	been	disconnected.	It	was	too	much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stood	and	looked	at	Jack	Reagan	and	his	minion	and	screamed,	“This-is-</p>
<p class="calibre1">not-what-happened!”	 She	 then	 forced	 herself	 to	 hold	 her	 emotions	 in	 check, although	it	felt	like	covering	a	volcano. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 Reagan,	 however,	 did	 not	 look	 like	 a	 victorious	 conqueror.	 He	 looked slightly	 to	 the	 side	 as	 if	 in	 thought,	 reviewing	 the	 situation.	 Obviously, something	was	not	right	with	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ms.	 Lynch,”	 Harry	 Meldrom	 said,	 “the	 evidence	 has	 been	 recovered	 and certified	 by	 a	 professional	 engineer.	 And	 it	 demonstrates	 quite	 well	 what happened	on	the	mining	ship.	Now,	your	counsel	has	completed	testimony,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s	time	for	you	to	receive	your	just	sentence.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 already	 served	 a	 sentence.	 After	 this,	 I’m	 getting	 on	 the	 first	 ship	 out	 of this	hellhole.”	She	left	her	chair	and	walked	to	the	prosecutor’s	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Harry	 Meldrom	 stood	 up,	 too,	 and	 stepped	 closer	 to	 Jack	 Reagan.	 “Ms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lynch,	I	agree	that	you’ll	be	on	the	next	ship.	But	you’ll	be	back	in	Earth	orbit thirty	years	later.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 continued	 to	 close	 in	 on	 Harry	 Meldrom.	 She	 had	 her	 guard	 up	 as	 she got	close—and	she	fell	to	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bailiffs,	please	return	Ms.	Lynch	to	her	chair,”	Jack	Reagan	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	couldn’t	move.	She	heard	everything	people	were	saying,	and	she	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	and	move	her	eyes,	but	that	was	it.	In	a	second,	she	felt	hands	on	her	arms, and	they	lifted	her	to	her	feet	without	putting	weight	on	them.	She	could	see	the two	 female	 bailiffs	 carrying	 her	 back	 to	 her	 chair.	 They	 sat	 her	 down	 and	 put straps	over	her	arms	that	secured	them	to	the	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 felt	 Nancy	 lean	 close	 to	 her.	 “I’ll	 take	 it	 from	 here	 and	 see	 what	 I	 can salvage,”	Nancy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	could	look	at	the	JJ	screen	and	see	about	sixty	degrees	in	each	direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	ability	to	move	her	head	was	gone.	She	just	listened	and	prayed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>Nancy	 stood.	 “The	 Defense	 objects	 to	 the	 introduction	 of	 the	 recently displayed	 evidence,”	 she	 said.	 “We	 strongly	 suggest	 the	 court	 remove	 the	 data from	any	records	used	to	tabulate	the	final	decision.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 saw	 text	 appear	 on	 the	 screen.	 “Objection	 respectfully	 overruled,”	 the text	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	 that	 case,”	 Nancy	 continued,	 “The	 Defense	 requires	 a	 recess	 to	 review. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 defendant	 hastily	 overruled	 her	 counsel	 in	 this	 matter,	 and	 we	 feel	 such	 a course	would	be	granted	upon	appeal	should	the	recess	of	at	least	thirty	days	not be	granted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 saw	 displayed	 on	 the	 JJ	 screen:	 “Defendant’s	 overrule	 of	 counsel	 has happened	 before	 in	 this	 jurisdiction	 and	 has	 not	 been	 appealed.	 Previous	 case law	does	not	exist	to	predict	outcome	of	appeal.	Recess	will	not	be	granted.”	Her arms	grew	cold	when	she	sensed	Nancy	had	sat	back	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	the	best	I	can	do	for	now,”	Nancy	whispered.	“We’ll	have	to	see	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">happens.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	cried.	With	the	paralysis	wearing	off,	she	could	only	shed	a	few	tears.	It made	her	stomach	hurt.	She	could	only	hope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 screen	 displayed:	 “Does	 the	 State	 and	 Defense	 have	 further</p>
<p class="calibre1">information?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	Jack	Reagan	said	first.	Nancy	also	replied	in	the	negative. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	screen	went	blank	and	then	displayed	“76.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes!”	a	man	behind	Pati	screamed,	and	applause	broke	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Defense	appeals	this	decision,”	Nancy	yelled	above	the	crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 state	 notes	 the	 request,”	 Jack	 Reagan	 replied,	 in	 a	 voice	 that	 also carried	above	the	crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	needed	to	break	down,	cover	her	face,	and	sob	like	she	never	had.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">score	she	received	meant	she	was	being	repatriated	back	to	Earth.	However	long she	didn’t	remember,	she	just	knew	she	was	in	for	hell,	or	even	worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,”	Nancy	said,	from	behind	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 paralyzing	 drug	 had	 mostly	 worn	 off,	 and	 Pati	 sobbed	 without	 making much	 noise.	 She	 felt	 her	 chair	 move	 forward.	 There	 must	 have	 been	 wheels somewhere	in	the	legs,	and	Nancy	rolled	her	toward	the	JJ	screen.	Before	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">went	 through	 the	 door	 that	 led	 to	 the	 docks,	 Nancy	 walked	 to	 her	 front	 and leaned	over	to	get	close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	be	in	orbit	around	Saturn	during	the	appeal,	instead	of	the	long	trip</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	to	Earth.	Even	in	the	best	case,	you’re	not	getting	back	to	Earth	for	a	few years,	 but	 I	 think	 we	 can	 still	 get	 you	 there	 with	 all	 the	 complexities	 of	 this	 JJ</p>
<p class="calibre1">decision.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	still	cried,	making	more	noise	as	they	approached	the	door.	It	opened	on</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>their	 approach,	 and	 Nancy	 wheeled	 her	 through.	 They	 entered	 a	 brightly	 lit, white	hallway	alone,	and	Pati	heard	the	door	shut	behind	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	 course,	 things	 would	 have	 gone	 better	 for	 you	 had	 you	 listened	 to Temujin,	and	joined	us,”	Nancy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 drug’s	 effect	 dissipated	 enough	 so	 Pati’s	 jaw	 could	 open.	 She	 tried	 to	 ask how	 Nancy	 knew	 about	 Temujin,	 because	 that	 was	 not	 a	 name	 she	 gave	 to Connie	 to	 report.	 She	 only	 told	 Connie	 she	 had	 met	 with	 the	 leader	 of	 the extraterrestrials. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 wanted	 that	 name	 after	 we	 learned	 more	 about	 your	 history	 on	 Earth,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	said.	“It	seemed	appropriate	since	you	labeled	our	land,	Xanadu,	and	then this	 settlement,	 Karakorum.”	 She	 pushed	 Pati’s	 chair	 down	 the	 white	 hallway, with	white,	windowed	doors	on	the	left	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	couldn’t	ask	questions,	first,	because	the	drug	still	slightly	affected	her, second,	 because	 she	 still	 tried	 to	 wrap	 her	 brain	 around	 what	 she	 heard	 from Nancy’s	 mouth.	 Finally,	 she	 was	 a	 condemned	 woman,	 and	 the	 life	 she’d	 been sentenced	to	seemed	as	dark	as	this	hallway	was	white. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 stopped	 the	 chair	 and	 stepped	 around	 to	 look	 Pati	 in	 the	 eyes.	 She stood	 there,	 different.	 Even	 wearing	 the	 same	 business	 suit,	 the	 same	 hairstyle, and	the	same	makeup:	she	wasn’t	Nancy	Tate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“While	 you	 were	 on	 the	 mining	 ship,	 Nancy	 made	 the	 right	 decision	 and joined	 with	 us.	 She’s	 with	 me	 now,	 and	 she’s	 never	 been	 happier.	 Just	 like	 we promised	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 understood	 what	 the	 alien	 believed,	 and	 she	 couldn’t	 believe	 a	 person would	 agree	 to	 that	 deal.	 Pati	 wanted	 to	 strike	 out	 and	 snap	 her	 neck,	 possibly relieve	Nancy	of	the	possession	as	she	did	for	Richard.	It	also	would	give	her	the chance	to	escape.	With	the	drug	wearing	off,	would	she	have	a	chance? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	have	to	worry	about	anyone	hearing	us.	This	hallway	is	blocked	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	condemned	and	their	attorneys.	The	state	goes	the	extra	effort	to	see	that	our conversations	remain	private.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 were	 six	 doors	 total.	 When	 Nancy	 brought	 her	 here	 yesterday,	 she pointed	 out	 doors	 three	 and	 six	 as	 the	 likely	 ships	 for	 the	 next	 repatriate.	 One through	three	were	for	the	shorter	trips,	lasting	less	than	two	decades.	While	four</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>through	six	were	for	the	longer	ones,	lasting	up	to	half	a	lifetime.	Each	door	had a	 window	 that	 allowed	 a	 person	 to	 ensure	 a	 ship	 was	 on	 the	 other	 side	 before opening.	The	ship’s	hatch	also	contained	windows	for	the	same	reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 could	 have	 avoided	 this,”	 Nancy	 said.	 “The	 engineer	 was	 ready	 to make	the	records	look	like	whatever	we	wanted	them	to	look	like.	Make	it	look</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	Bruno	and	the	twins	died	by	accident—simple—and	if	you’d	joined	us,	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	have	happened,	and	you’d	be	free.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 drug	 had	 worn	 off,	 but	 Pati	 remained	 silent.	 She	 tested	 the	 straps securing	 her	 wrists.	 Simple	 velcro	 held	 them	 in	 place,	 which	 is	 what	 she expected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you	going	to	the	media	didn’t	make	our	mission	easier.	Luckily,	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	 temper,	 we	 could	 use	 the	 youth	 who	 had	 joined	 us	 to	 unnerve	 you.	 That worked	 well	 in	 the	 trial	 when	 you	 overruled	 Nancy	 Tate.	 I	 couldn’t	 look	 like	 I was	throwing	you	to	the	wolves	and	still	have	people	believe	I	was	your	defense counsel.	Fortunately,	you	did	your	part	admirably,	and	now	I	can	put	you	on	the boat	to	Earth,	which	will	orbit	Saturn	during	your	appeal.	I	might	even	get	you acquitted,	but	you	will	never	see	Earth	again.	In	fact,	the	ship	will	have	technical difficulties	 soon	 after	 you	 lift	 off.	 I	 won’t	 tell	 you	 what	 they’ll	 be	 because	 you should	have	the	excitement	of	finding	out	for	yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 walked	 back	 behind	 Pati	 and	 pushed	 her	 forward	 again.	 “I	 think	 the airlock	to	your	ship	is	behind	the	fifth	door,”	Nancy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	saw	the	door	approaching	fast.	The	straps	on	her	wrists	and	ankles	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">well	 placed.	 Jumping	 up,	 breaking	 free	 of	 the	 restraints,	 and	 attacking	 Nancy wasn’t	going	to	happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	here	we	are,”	Nancy	said	when	she	stopped	at	the	airlock.	She	walked</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	door	and	pushed	the	enter	button	on	the	right	side	of	the	airlock	door.	The doors	opened,	and	Pati	could	see	the	interior	of	the	ship	the	state	expected	her	to live	much	of	the	rest	of	her	life	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	as	your	attorney,	I	need	to	explain	to	you	that	you’ll	board	this	ship, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 after	 liftoff,	 you’ll	 orbit	 Saturn	 until	 your	 appeal	 is	 complete.	 If	 you’re acquitted,	 you’ll	 return	 here	 immediately.	 If	 your	 sentence	 is	 upheld,	 the	 ship will	then	travel	to	Earth	and	arrive	approximately	thirty	years	from	today.”	She smiled.	“Although	you	needn’t	worry,	you’ll	not	have	to	suffer	that	long.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 remained	 silent.	 Nancy	 went	 behind	 her	 and	 pushed	 the	 chair	 through the	hatch.	Pati	spent	hours	the	previous	night	getting	to	know	this	model,	and	she recognized	 every	 piece	 as	 Nancy	 pushed	 her	 toward	 what	 was	 called	 the command	 center.	 A	 humorous	 designation,	 considering	 the	 occupant	 would command	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 pushed	 her	 to	 a	 spot	 up	 front	 where	 the	 chair	 was	 designed	 to	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>secured	 and	 would	 be	 part	 of	 the	 furniture	 after	 launch.	 Pati	 felt	 it	 lock	 into position,	and	her	arms	remained	strapped	to	the	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll	be	on	your	way	soon,”	Nancy	said.	She	walked	once	again	to	Pati’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">front.	 She	 had	 a	 look	 that	 was	 even	 more	 removed	 from	 the	 Nancy	 Tate	 she knew.	“And,	they	have	commanded	me	to	complete	one	more	task.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	 pulled	 out	 a	 decimeter-long	 knife	 from	 the	 inside	 of	 her	 jacket	 and held	it	in	her	right	hand.	The	metal	reflected	off	the	ship’s	lighting.	“I	was	told	to kill	 you	 before	 you	 left.	 Temujin	 believes	 you’ll	 escape	 again	 unless	 you	 are eliminated	directly	by	hand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	can’t	kill	me	himself,”	Pati	spat.	The	bravado	masked	her	fear.	She	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">resolved	 not	 to	 say	 a	 word,	 and	 yet	 the	 brandished	 knife	 ended	 that	 resolution because	this	could	be	her	end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	after	your	last	meeting,	he’d	found	a	cooperative	human	and	is	busy</p>
<p class="calibre1">attending	to	him.	Temujin	planned	on	dealing	with	you	directly,	and	we	worked</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	extend	the	trial	so	he	could	accomplish	the	act.	Since	you	rushed	the	process, he	had	an	alternative	plan	to	delegate	the	mission	to	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	saw	Nancy	take	a	deep	breath	and	look	her	over.	Pati	hadn’t	prayed	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">long	 time.	 She	 didn’t	 close	 her	 eyes,	 but	 she	 did	 think	 out	 a	 quick	 prayer	 for help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	 again,	 it	 wouldn’t	 look	 good	 if	 I	 had	 blood	 on	 my	 clothes,”	 Nancy said.	“If	I	had	time	to	prepare,	I	could	have	had	a	cleaner	method	of	disposing	of you,	but	I’ll	just	have	to	let	the	ship’s	programing	do	its	job.”	Nancy	returned	the knife	 to	 her	 pocket.	 “Goodbye,	 it’s	 been	 nice	 working	 with	 you,”	 she	 said	 and walked	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 could	 hear	 the	 light	 footsteps	 toward	 the	 hatch,	 and	 it	 was	 time	 to activate	 Plan	 B.	 She	 hadn’t	 lived	 with	 Bruno	 and	 the	 twins	 for	 three	 months without	learning	how	easily	situations	could	go	wrong.	She	had	to	expect	it	and be	prepared.	That	she	would	wind	up	on	a	ship	back	to	Earth	after	the	trial	was not	considered	likely,	but	it	was	possible,	and	she	had	to	be	ready. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 had	 reviewed	 the	 procedures	 for	 transporting	 a	 condemned	 criminal	 to these	 ships,	 how	 they’re	 secured	 from	 the	 courtroom,	 and	 how	 they	 are	 moved there	 by	 the	 defense	 counsel.	 Sometimes	 the	 defense	 counsel	 was	 not	 trusted, and	 the	 bailiffs	 would	 provide	 the	 transport.	 Pati	 was	 prepared	 for	 either situation,	and	it	started	with	the	small	pliers	she’d	placed	in	each	of	her	sleeves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	Nancy	four	steps	behind	her,	Pati	pronated	her	wrists	to	pull	out	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">pliers.	She’d	practiced	this	move	last	night,	and	in	a	second,	had	the	set	from	her right	 sleeve	 out.	 She	 held	 them	 in	 her	 fingers	 and	 thumb,	 again	 severely pronating	the	wrist	and	clamped	on	the	strap	that	held	her	arm	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	pulled	out	the	other	pliers	with	her	left	hand.	While	the	right-side	strap</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>was	 held	 tighter	 and	 farther	 up	 her	 forearm,	 the	 left	 strap	 was	 looser,	 and	 she could	loosen	it	further.	It	allowed	her	to	slip	her	arm	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	was	at	the	door,	and	Pati	could	afford	the	sound	lifting	the	strap	off	of her	right	wrist.	The	same	with	her	ankles	tied	to	the	chair.	Pati	swung	her	head around	 to	 make	 sure	 Nancy	 had	 exited.	 She	 was	 no	 longer	 on	 the	 ship	 and	 the hatches	began	to	close.	Pati	jumped	from	the	chair,	pulling	off	her	right	shoe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 shoe	 was	 a	 flat	 sole,	 black,	 and	 ankle-high.	 It	 matched	 the	 business casual	 ensemble	 she	 wore	 and	 was	 made	 of	 faux	 leather.	 Compared	 to	 most shoes	worn	on	Titan,	it	was	substantial,	and	perfect	for	the	task	at	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ship’s	hatch	and	dock	door	closed	simultaneously,	and	Pati	had	at	least</p>
<p class="calibre1">five	seconds	after	Nancy	walked	through.	She	also	had	to	be	light	on	the	floor	as she	raced	to	the	exit	because	she	might	launch	herself	into	the	ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	had	maybe	two	decimeters	to	close,	and	Pati	dove,	grabbing	a	shelf</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 left	 side	 to	 help	 propel	 her.	 Pati	 bounced	 off	 the	 deck,	 rose	 up,	 and smashed	into	the	hatch.	The	hatch	then	finished	its	downward	cycle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or	had	it?	Pati	straightened	and	saw	she	had	her	shoe	trapped	underneath	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hatch.	 It	 no	 longer	 moved,	 but	 she	 also	 did	 not	 hear	 the	 latching	 sounds	 that would	accompany	securing	a	ship	from	the	vacuum	of	space. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 exhaled	 and	 allowed	 herself	 a	 tight	 smile.	 Step	 one	 of	 her	 plan	 had worked.	She	took	a	deep	breath,	realizing	steps	two,	three,	and	four	depended	on a	 great	 deal	 of	 luck.	 After	 step	 four,	 she’d	 have	 to	 figure	 out	 step	 five	 and	 the rest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First,	she	had	to	open	this	hatch.	Since	they	secured	a	prisoner	to	the	chair, there	 was	 no	 need	 to	 lock	 them	 in	 the	 ship	 before	 launch.	 The	 square	 control panel	 on	 the	 right	 side	 had	 an	 emergency	 open	 switch,	 and	 Pati	 flipped	 off	 the cover	and	engaged.	The	hatch	slowly	opened	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	 retrieving	 her	 shoe,	 she	 walked	 back	 to	 the	 galley	 section,	 pulled	 a glove	 used	 for	 cooking,	 and	 placed	 it	 in	 the	 gap	 where	 the	 hatch	 would	 try	 to seal.	She	then	put	her	bent	shoe	back	on,	grateful	the	sole	wasn’t	damaged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking	through	the	window	in	the	dock	door,	she	checked	to	make	sure	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hallway	was	clear	of	people.	Nancy	should	have	exited	by	now	unless	she	waited for	the	launch.	If	that	had	been	the	case,	her	face	would	be	on	the	other	side	of the	docking	hatch,	staring	back	at	Pati,	and	aware	of	why	the	ship	hadn’t	left.	Or, possibly,	 she	 had	 watched	 every	 move	 Pati	 made	 and	 had	 already	 called	 the bailiffs	in	to	shoot	her	with	the	tranquilizer	guns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	 Nancy’s	 face	 wasn’t	 visible,	 Pati	 felt	 confident.	 She	 stuck	 her	 head toward	the	window	and	looked	around	the	hallway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy	was	still	there,	and	she	wasn’t	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a><b class="calibre2">10	Run	for	Your	Life</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	had	planned	her	escape.	Once	she	blocked	the	ship’s	hatch	from	closing,	she knew	 she	 could	 open	 it	 again	 from	 the	 inside.	 That	 would	 leave	 her	 only	 the docking	 hatch	 to	 open	 before	 she	 could	 escape	 from	 the	 ship	 that	 would, according	to	Nancy,	take	her	to	a	quick	if	merciful	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	the	ship’s	hatch,	the	docking	hatch	had	a	window,	and	a	control	panel	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 upper	 right.	 The	 control	 panel	 was	 for	 emergencies	 only	 and	 was	 less complex.	 There	 was	 a	 simple	 open	 and	 close	 button,	 built	 to	 withstand	 Titan’s atmosphere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	docking	hatch	also	had	a	window,	and	because	Nancy	was	on	the	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">side,	Pati	waited	to	open	it.	She	held	her	right	hand	next	to	the	control	panel	and tried	to	decipher	what	was	going	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 saw	 Nancy	 standing	 off	 to	 the	 left	 facing	 away,	 near	 the	 door	 to	 the spaceport	which	was	secured	from	entry.	Pati	couldn’t	hear	the	sounds;	she	could only	 see	 body	 movements.	 Nancy	 appeared	 to	 be	 screaming.	 Then	 she	 lunged forward,	and	just	as	quickly,	she	jerked	back.	Not	just	her	head,	her	entire	body flew	at	least	three	meters	before	landing	on	the	floor	of	the	hallway.	She	didn’t get	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 saw	 Joe	 Tate	 standing	 where	 Nancy	 had	 been.	 He	 didn’t	 stand	 there long;	 he	 rushed	 to	 Nancy	 and	 knelt	 down	 beside	 her.	 He	 seemed	 to	 try	 to	 help her	up	or	was	he	trying	to	aid	her	in	some	way.	After	a	few	seconds,	he	put	both of	his	hands	to	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	know	if	she	should	still	wait.	She	intended	to	disembark	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ship	 into	 an	 empty	 hallway.	 Once	 the	 hatch	 and	 ship’s	 door	 closed	 behind	 her, the	ship	would	launch	into	an	orbit	around	Saturn.	If	Nancy’s	alien	friends	had reprogrammed	it	to	crash,	Pati	would	have	a	cover	and	more	time	to	find	a	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	to	Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	the	ship	didn’t	launch	soon,	though,	it	would	attract	attention.	She	couldn’t wait	much	longer.	But	how	could	she	get	past	Joe	Tate?	And	what	happened	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nancy? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	only	took	a	few	more	seconds	next	to	Nancy.	He	stood	and	put	his	hands</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	his	hips	while	still	staring	at	Nancy	on	the	floor.	He	then	looked	right	at	Pati. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 didn’t	 have	 time	 to	 duck.	 She	 stayed	 still,	 hoping	 he	 didn’t	 look	 at	 her specifically.	 There	 was	 the	 possibility	 he	 just	 looked	 in	 her	 direction,	 and	 her movement	from	the	window	might	catch	his	attention.	She	hoped	he	would	turn</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a>away	in	a	second	and	then	wander	out	of	the	hallway	from	whichever	way	he’d entered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	disappointed.	He	strode	straight	to	the	docking	hatch	and	looked	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 eyes	 through	 the	 window.	 His	 eyes	 seemed	 intent	 and	 emotionless.	 He pushed	buttons	next	to	the	hatch,	and	it	opened.	He	waved	her	to	follow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 didn’t	 have	 much	 of	 a	 choice	 and	 stepped	 through	 the	 open	 hatch	 into the	hallway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	dead,”	Joe	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	we	have	time	to	discuss.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	we	do	with	her,	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’ll	 have	 to	 carry	 out	 your	 sentence,”	 Joe	 said.	 “Help	 me	 put	 her	 in	 the ship.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	followed	and	helped	pick	her	up.	Despite	having	just	killed	his	wife,	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">surprised	 Pati	 how	 gingerly	 he	 held	 her	 head	 and	 shoulders.	 Pati	 grabbed	 her legs	and	followed	him	through	the	hatch.	They	sat	her	in	the	chair,	Pati’s	chair, and	they	walked	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	stopped	to	grab	a	towel	from	a	drawer	in	the	galley.	She	noticed	he	had	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">wound	in	his	left	forearm.	He	wiped	the	blood	off	and	took	a	large	bandage	from the	medical	supply	cabinet.	He	applied	the	bandage	to	the	wound,	which	stopped the	blood	flow	and	remained	attached	to	his	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	walked	back	to	where	he	hit	Nancy,	and	Pati	saw	blood	on	the	floor.	Joe</p>
<p class="calibre1">stepped	over	and	wiped	it	up.	“It’s	my	blood,”	he	said.	“She	slashed	me	with	the knife,	which	is	why	I	punched	back.”	He	finished	wiping	the	blood	and	returned the	towel	to	the	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	followed	him	part	of	the	way	into	the	ship.	She	removed	the	glove	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 ship’s	 hatch	 and	 tossed	 it	 in.	 Joe	 walked	 out	 after	 taking	 one	 last	 look	 at Nancy.	The	doors	activated	and	he	stood	there	waiting	for	them	to	shut.	“Did	I	at least	get	the	alien	in	her,	too?”	he	asked	Pati	without	turning	to	face	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 had	 to	 think	 first,	 and	 then	 answered.	 “No,	 the	 alien	 in	 Richard	 came back	to	haunt	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	 nodded,	 and	 Pati	 heard	 the	 ship	 move	 away	 from	 the	 dock.	 He	 looked down	the	hall	to	the	spaceport	door.	“Follow	me,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 had	 planned	 on	 getting	 out	 that	 way,	 and	 it	 was	 good	 to	 have	 a	 guide who	worked	in	the	spaceport	and	knew	every	square	meter.	She	followed	him	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	door,	but	once	they	reached	it,	he	turned	to	the	right	and	tapped	the	wall.	He pushed	open	a	door	that	had	been	invisible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	did	this	come	from?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	didn’t	respond.	He	walked	in	and	stood	there,	waiting	for	her	to	follow. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>Pati	 looked	 back	 down	 the	 hall,	 seeing	 the	 polished	 white	 throughout,	 and nothing	left	to	reveal	what	had	just	happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 hurried	 in,	 and	 he	 pushed	 the	 door	 closed.	 She	 saw	 a	 lever	 protruding from	 the	 center	 of	 the	 door	 and	 a	 handle	 on	 the	 right	 side.	 She	 heard	 a	 latch engage,	and	he	turned	back	to	face	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	place	should	be	a	sanctuary	for	us	for	the	moment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,	how	did	you	know	they	possessed	her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	 took	 a	 deep	 breath.	 “Okay,	 you	 knew	 we	 were	 having	 trouble,	 and	 I hadn’t	been	home	for	a	while.	Well,	it’s	because	she	changed	a	couple	of	months ago,	and	when	your	alien	report	came	out,	it	explained	why	or	at	least	gave	me	a good	idea.	I	was	in	the	spaceport	during	your	trial.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	they	fired	you;	that’s	what	Nancy	told	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Suspended	 for	 a	 day.	 I	 knew	 about	 this	 tunnel	 since	 I	 help	 build	 this courthouse.	Working	construction	was	my	first	job	when	I	arrived	from	Earth.	I saw	 the	 drawings	 and	 checked	 it	 out	 later	 on.	 I	 think	 the	 McLears	 wanted	 it added	in	secret.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kerry	McLear	was	at	my	trial.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	was?	Then	this	might	not	be	a	safe	place.	Let’s	get	going.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait,	what	happened	with	Nancy	in	the	hallway?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stopped,	sighed.	“When	your	score	was	announced,	I	knew	she	would	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">taking	 you	 to	 your	 ship.	 You	 would	 be	 alone	 together,	 and	 I	 thought	 the	 alien might	 reveal	 herself.	 I	 raced	 to	 this	 tunnel,	 walked	 through,	 and	 placed	 my handheld	on	the	hallway	floor,	shutting	the	door	behind	me.	After	she	delivered you	to	the	ship,	I	was	waiting	in	the	hallway	with	my	handheld,	having	recorded your	entire	conversation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	she	told	me	about	Temujin?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	whoever	that	is?	But	she	exploded	like	I’d	never	seen	before,	and	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">attacked	me	with	this	knife.”	Joe	pulled	the	bloodstained	knife	out	of	his	pocket and	held	it	up	to	Pati.	“I	couldn’t	believe	it,	she’d	never	been	violent	like	that, and	when	the	knife	came	toward	me,	I	just	reacted.”	He	shook	his	head.	“I	didn’t want	it	to	end	like	this,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	how	you	feel,”	Pati	said.	The	passageway	she	stood	in	was	a	light-</p>
<p class="calibre1">brown	color	with	an	oak-like	wooden	finish.	Single	lights	illuminated	along	the path,	 and	 she	 could	 see	 a	 door	 at	 the	 end,	 maybe	 twenty	 or	 twenty-five	 meters away.	“Should	we	keep	going?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 didn’t	 reply.	 He	 put	 the	 knife	 away	 and	 moved.	 She	 followed	 him	 to	 a door	that	had	a	similar	lever	and	handle	attached.	Joe	tapped	a	switch	next	to	the door,	and	the	lights	went	out.	Pati	saw	nothing	but	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>“I’ve	 got	 a	 hold	 of	 the	 door,”	 Joe	 said.	 “I’m	 going	 to	 crack	 it	 and	 see	 if anyone's	out	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Out	where?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	opens	between	the	two	buildings.	It’s	a	covered	space,	and	you	can’t	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	 door	 unless	 you’re	 standing	 next	 to	 it.	 I	 don’t	 want	 to	 take	 any	 chances, though.”	 The	 door	 cracked	 open,	 and	 she	 saw	 his	 outline	 from	 the	 light	 that entered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	to	look	at	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	we	do	when	we	get	out	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	guess	we	find	a	way	to	get	lost.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 think	 up	 north,	 near	 the	 old	 areas	 of	 Karakorum.	 A	 lot	 of	 that	 area	 is deserted,	and	we	can	plan	on	how	to	survive	from	there.	Given	what	happened	in your	trial	for	murder,	I	expect	I’ll	get	the	same	treatment	for	what	I	did	to	Nancy if	I’m	caught.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	both	fugitives	from	the	law.	Fugitives	where	every	person	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	monitored	and	facial	recognition	cameras	were	as	prevalent	as	traffic	control devices.	 The	 only	 thing	 they	 had	 going	 for	 them	 was	 a	 minuscule	 timeframe before	the	authorities	would	notice	Nancy	was	missing.	When	they	went	to	look</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	Joe	and	found	him	missing	as	well,	the	game	would	be	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	Pati,	all	it	would	take	was	one	person	recognizing	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	 finished	 checking	 outside	 and	 opened	 the	 door	 to	 walk	 through.	 Pati followed,	 and	 the	 door	 shut	 automatically	 behind	 them.	 What	 was	 a	 secret hallway	opening	became	indistinguishable	from	the	surrounding	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 had	 exited	 into	 landscaping	 and	 stood	 on	 rubble	 mined	 from	 Titan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 a	 fake	 terrace	 with	 trees	 and	 bushes	 between	 them	 and	 the	 south terminus	station.	The	angle	of	the	building	made	it	difficult	for	those	emerging from	 the	 spaceport	 terminal	 to	 see	 them	 standing	 there.	 It	 wasn’t	 impossible	 to see	them,	just	unlikely.	And	if	they	ducked,	they’d	be	invisible	from	the	distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	 walk	 from	 here,”	 Joe	 said.	 “You	 able	 to	 make	 it	 to	 the	 other	 end	 of Karakorum?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	from	Earth,	remember,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hopefully,	 that	 means	 yes,”	 he	 said.	 He	 walked	 toward	 the	 spaceport entrance,	then	around	the	landscaping	toward	the	terminus	station.	People	were getting	off	the	train	and	making	their	way	in,	which	caused	Joe	to	stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 waited	 for	 the	 last	 person	 to	 enter	 the	 terminal	 and	 then	 turned	 to	 Pati. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait	here,”	he	said.	He	hurried	to	the	terminal	entrance	and	went	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	need	this,”	she	whispered	to	herself.	With	him	going	off	on	his	own, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>what	would	happen	to	her?	How	long	did	he	expect	her	to	wait? </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	to	admit,	though;	he	solved	problems	two	through	five	for	her.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">escaped	her	sentence	of	a	thirty-year	voyage	back	to	Earth.	And	now	she	stood</p>
<p class="calibre1">outside	the	courthouse,	semi-free,	determining	her	next	steps	for	survival.	If	the options	looked	bleak,	they	didn’t	look	hopeless	or	impossible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 waited,	 maybe	 ten	 minutes.	 Her	 handheld	 was	 left	 back	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">courthouse,	 so	 she	 didn’t	 really	 know	 how	 long	 Joe	 had	 been	 gone.	 If	 he deserted	 her,	 she’d	 have	 to	 survive	 without	 the	 knowledge	 of	 how	 to	 live	 in Karakorum	 without	 resources.	 Her	 situation	 might	 still	 be	 hopeless	 and impossible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 yet,	 he	 needed	 her,	 too.	 She	 was	 the	 only	 witness	 to	 Nancy	 attacking him.	If	he	was	caught,	he’d	need	her.	Keeping	her	safe	was	in	his	best	interest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Did	he	know	it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	marched	out	of	the	terminal	entrance	at	a	fast	step.	He	carried	objects	in his	 arms	 Pati	 couldn’t	 make	 out.	 When	 he	 got	 closer,	 it	 looked	 like	 he	 carried two	hats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here,	put	this	on,”	Joe	said,	handing	her	a	brown	cloth	hat	that	she’d	seen</p>
<p class="calibre1">workers	 in	 the	 spaceport	 don.	 It	 had	 a	 wide	 brim	 extending	 around	 the circumference. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	for?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fewer	people	will	notice	you	this	way.	We’re	getting	off	this	moon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	need	a	hat	to	leave	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 we’re	 going	 to	 your	 apartment	 to	 get	 clothes	 and	 personal	 stuff	 you can’t	live	without.	We’ll	go	to	my	place	first	and	do	the	same.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	we	need	to	do	that.	Can’t	we	just	go—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	a	guy	whose	shuttle	is	leaving	in	two	hours.	No	more	and	no	less,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	 said.	 “The	 last	 place	 we	 want	 to	 be	 is	 standing	 around	 in	 the	 spaceport. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s	 no	 safe	 place	 for	 us,	 and	 we	 might	 as	 well	 keep	 moving	 till	 we	 come back	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	if	we	just	find	a	place	to	hole	up	that’s	safe?	Then	we’ll	come	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">here	in	time	to	leave?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	think	of	one	place	that	we	wouldn’t	have	to	travel	to.	Might	as	well</p>
<p class="calibre1">grab	what	we	need	before	we	leave	because	I	don’t	think	we’ll	be	coming	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	a	while.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	didn’t	enjoy	hearing	the	last	part	of	his	statement.	However,	she	couldn’t argue	with	the	first,	and	after	putting	the	hat	on	followed	him	past	the	terminus, and	along	the	roadway	that	paralleled	the	rails. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 waited	 across	 from	 her	 apartment	 building.	 It	 was	 about	 a	 hundred	 meters away,	and	she	could	just	make	out	the	people	who	entered	and	exited.	She	didn’t want	 to	 get	 any	 closer	 and	 perhaps	 be	 recognized,	 while	 at	 the	 same	 time,	 she wanted	to	be	ready	the	moment	Joe	walked	out.	They	had	stopped	by	the	hostel</p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	was	staying	at	and	picked	up	the	few	possessions	he’d	took	with	him	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	left	Nancy.	Along	the	way,	it	was	an	interesting	conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	with	the	ship	leaving	in	two	hours	was	a	recruiter	for	an	ice-mining</p>
<p class="calibre1">colony	 on	 a	 nearby	 moon.	 Joe	 knew	 him	 from	 his	 multiple	 trips	 to	 Karakorum looking	 for	 workers.	 He	 also	 knew	 there	 would	 be	 no	 questions	 asked	 of	 a couple	of	Earth-borns	who	wanted	jobs	and	will	work	immediately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 had	 never	 heard	 of	 the	 place.	 She	 questioned	 why,	 considering	 ice-mining	was	all	she’d	done	for	the	last	three	months.	Joe	said	the	ice	was	not	sent to	 Karakorum	 or	 anywhere	 else	 around	 Saturn	 but	 was	 destined	 for	 the	 inner solar	system. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 didn’t	 stop	 her.	 She	 wanted	 to	 know	 what	 would	 happen	 when	 the constables	at	that	colony	recognized	them.	He	had	an	answer	for	that,	too.	The moon	was	outside	the	McLear	influence	and	not	governed	through	Karakorum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	went	straight	to	the	confederacy	for	policing,	which	was	a	very,	very	long	way away.	Another	reason	it	would	be	the	perfect	location	to	hole	up	for	a	while. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 wasn’t	 convinced,	 but	 she	 could	 not	 think	 of	 an	 alternative	 plan	 to ensure	 survival.	 Joe	 seemed	 confident,	 when	 he	 didn’t	 feel	 remorse	 for	 killing Nancy,	which	Pati	hoped	wouldn’t	become	a	problem	of	its	own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 checked	 the	 spare	 handheld	 that	 Joe	 gave	 her.	 He’d	 been	 gone	 about fifteen	minutes,	and	they	had	less	than	an	hour	to	get	back	to	the	spaceport.	She used	the	handheld	to	calculate	how	long	to	walk	back,	and	they	still	had	minutes to	spare,	assuming	no	other	issues	arose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 heart	 jumped	 when	 she	 saw	 him	 at	 the	 entrance.	 It	 beat	 harder	 as	 he stopped	to	talk.	She	couldn’t	make	out	who	he	talked	with,	and	possibly	it	was the	 static	 robot	 at	 the	 desk.	 He	 held	 her	 case	 she	 used	 for	 short	 trips	 and continued	 to	 talk.	 Pati	 leaned	 left	 and	 right	 as	 if	 it	 would	 help	 her	 see	 better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	Joe	walked	away	at	a	fast	step	toward	Pati’s	location.	A	minute	later,	he was	walking	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	to	hurry,”	he	said,	handing	her	the	case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know,	did	you	get	my	tablet,	too?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>“It’s	 in	 the	 case,”	 Joe	 said.	 He	 looked	 behind	 him.	 “The	 robot	 asked	 me	 to wait	at	the	desk	as	I	left.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	a	clue.	He	let	me	in	when	I	said	I	worked	for	Nancy	and	came	to	pick</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	your	possessions.	Didn’t	seem	to	be	interested	in	me	at	all.	Walking	out,	he called	me	by	name.	When	I	responded,	he	asked	me	to	wait.	When	I	asked	why</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	wouldn’t	give	me	a	straight	answer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	only	been	an	hour,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	they	tried	to	contact	the	ship	and	got	suspicious	when	there	wasn’t	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">response?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	saw	Joe	looked	down	and	put	his	right	hand	over	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Joe,	we	have	to	think	this	out,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	back	up	and	took	a	breath.	She	could	see	him	struggle	to	control</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself.	“We	can	walk	while	we	think,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 agreed	 by	 taking	 the	 lead	 heading	 back	 to	 the	 spaceport.	 They	 walked over	the	trolley	tracks	and	onto	the	walkway	going	south.	Most	people	did	that, and	their	faces	would	be	less	visible	with	fewer	walking	against	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	think	the	aliens	have	something	to	do	with	the	robot?”	Joe	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	considered	it.	If	Nancy	was	dead,	the	alien	in	her	had	communicated	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">fact	to	the	others.	Maybe	the	possessed	humans	couldn’t	overtly	go	after	them, so	they’d	have	to	find	a	way	to	get	the	word	out	that	fugitives	were	on	the	run. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	the	robot	that	tried	to	detain	Joe	was	the	result? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	lowered	her	face	and	pulled	her	hat	down	a	bit	when	a	lady	looked	at	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">too	long.	She	walked	faster,	and	Joe	kept	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve	only	forty-five	minutes	before	Gemini	takes	off,”	Joe	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	sure	this	guy’s	legitimate?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	where	he	works,	and	it’s	legitimate.	Or	at	least	I	know	it’s	there	and that	they’re	always	looking	for	workers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	wished	she	had	a	hood	to	help	hide	her	face	better.	The	crowds	weren’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">bad,	and	as	expected,	most	people	walked	with	them,	limiting	the	number	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	see	their	faces.	There	was	just	too	much	to	lose	by	being	recognized,	and Connie	Pearson’s	report	didn’t	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“From	the	Grand	Center,	it’s	only	another	thirty	minutes,”	Joe	said.	“I	think</p>
<p class="calibre1">we're	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 road	 opened	 up	 on	 both	 sides	 as	 they	 entered	 the	 Grand	 Center.	 The walkway	 paralleled	 the	 trolley	 lines,	 going	 straight	 through	 the	 Grand	 Center, which	 shortened	 the	 distance	 they	 had	 to	 travel.	 Pati	 found	 a	 couple	 walking ahead	of	them,	and	she	tailed	behind.	When	Joe	tried	to	walk	around	them,	she</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>grabbed	his	arm.	He	got	the	idea	to	use	them	as	a	cover.	Not	perfect,	but	at	least it	improved	their	chances	of	remaining	undetected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Groundcars	buzzed	by	on	their	left,	moving	about	twice	as	fast	as	the	crowd</p>
<p class="calibre1">walked.	 Pati	 had	 the	 thought	 of	 jumping	 on	 the	 back	 of	 one	 and	 forcing	 the driver	 to	 take	 them	 to	 the	 spaceport	 in	 half	 the	 time.	 They	 would	 probably	 get there,	too,	followed	by	half	the	constable	force	on	Titan.	Slow	and	steady	had	to be	the	motto	now,	and,	of	course,	stealth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	grabbed	her	arm	and	pulled	her	off	to	the	right.	In	the	one-sixth	gravity, he	carried	her	for	a	few	feet	till	he	stopped	and	let	her	feet	back	down.	“There were	constables	in	that	last	groundcar,”	he	said.	“One	of	them	turned	around.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	way,”	he	said.	He	pulled	her	again,	except	this	time	she	followed	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	walked	to	the	outside	of	the	crowd.	Joe	then	resumed	marching	toward	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">spaceport. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	now?”	Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	 turning	 around.	 I	 pulled	 you	 away	 right	 as	 we	 were	 in	 their	 blind spot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	think	they	saw	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	that’s	why	they’re	pulling	back	around.	I	don’t	know	for	sure.	I	don’t want	 to	 stay	 and	 find	 out	 either.”	 Joe	 stepped	 up	 and	 fell	 back	 in	 line	 with	 the crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	could	see	through	the	crowd	what	Joe	imagined.	The	groundcar	had	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">open	top,	and	it	wasn’t	marked.	The	three	men	and	one	woman	in	it	had	looped</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	and	were	again	heading	southbound,	and	they	were	searching	the	crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	walk	too	fast,”	Joe	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	might	find	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only	 if	 we	 look	 out	 of	 place.	 If	 they’re	 searching,	 it’s	 because	 they’re	 not sure	what	they	saw.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 wanted	 to	 sprint	 away.	 Instead,	 she	 forced	 herself	 to	 follow	 the	 crowd and	 stay	 in	 step	 with	 Joe.	 She	 pulled	 out	 her	 handheld	 and	 noted	 they’d	 lost	 a few	 minutes	 of	 time.	 The	 five-minute	 cushion	 they	 had	 when	 they	 left	 her apartment	was	down	to	three. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	worry	about	the	time,”	Joe	said.	“Try	to	keep	people	between	you	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	road.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 complied,	 although	 she	 peeked	 every	 few	 minutes	 to	 see	 where	 the constables	 were.	 Since	 they	 hadn’t	 gone	 off-road	 directly	 toward	 them,	 she figured	they	were	safe	for	the	moment.	And,	by	the	time	they	exited	the	Grand</p>
<p class="calibre1">Center,	 the	 crowd	 had	 thinned	 to	 where	 she	 could	 see	 the	 constables	 were	 no longer	after	them,	if	they	ever	had	been. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>“I	think	it	was	you	they	saw,”	Joe	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?	 The	 robot	 stopped	 you,”	 Pati	 replied.	 They	 continued	 to	 walk	 in	 a thinner	crowd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	were	the	last	person	they	saw	with	Nancy	in	the	courtroom.	I’m	just	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">husband	who	had	no	ability	to	even	get	to	her,	according	to	their	knowledge.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	could	have	walked	through	the	door	to	the	spaceport	hangar.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	locked	from	that	end.	With	our	code,	we	can	get	to	the	hangar	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">courtroom	hallway,	but	not	the	other	direction.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	sure,	Joe.	If	the	robot	tried	to	stop	you…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 just	 asked	 me	 to	 stay.	 I	 told	 it	 no,	 and	 nothing	 else	 happened	 when	 I walked	off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	had	no	ability	to	stop	you.	It	was	a	static	robot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	shook	his	head.	“Yeah,	but	the	constables	could	have	been	on	me	fairly</p>
<p class="calibre1">quickly	after	I	entered	your	apartment.	I	think	it’s	more	about	my	wife	missing and	 they	 wanted	 to	 contact	 me.	 Since	 those	 robots	 are	 part	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">communications	net,	it	responded	to	a	request	to	find	me	for	notification.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	didn’t	reply,	 because	she	couldn’t	 argue	against	his	 facts.	Her	feelings, though,	 said	 his	 facts	 didn’t	 tell	 the	 whole	 story.	 Still,	 he’d	 gotten	 her	 this	 far without	issue,	so	maybe	he	still	had	a	handle	on	the	situation.	Her	instinct	said otherwise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	ten	minutes,	they	passed	by	Pati’s	old	street.	She	would	not	even	glance	at the	McLear	house.	Those	days	were	gone,	and	there	was	too	much	work	to	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	 she	 could	 even	 be	 free,	 let	 alone	 rich.	 Someday,	 from	 Earth,	 she	 might find	the	legal	team	to	collect	the	settlement	they	had	promised	her.	This	was	not the	time	to	think	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 continued	 past	 the	 factories,	 and	 ten	 minutes	 after	 that	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">approaching	 the	 south	 terminus.	 Pati	 checked	 her	 handheld	 again,	 and	 they’d reclaimed	the	five-minute	cushion	they	started	with.	They	had	only	to	get	inside the	terminal.	That	thought	made	her	heart	sink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	led	her	into	the	parking	lot	Pati	was	familiar	with.	He	stopped	between</p>
<p class="calibre1">two	 parked	 groundcars	 that	 were	 perpendicular	 to	 the	 route	 they’d	 take	 to	 the terminal.	 The	 groundcars	 were	 short	 enough	 even	 for	 Earth-borns	 to	 see	 over, and	she	could	see	the	terminal	entrance	from	where	they	stood.	He	turned	to	face her.	“I’m	going	to	scout	the	entrance	and	make	sure	it’s	clear.	Once	we’re	in,	we turn	right	and	go	straight	into	the	hangar.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	the	route	well,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,	 once	 I’m	 sure,	 I’ll	 turn	 and	 wave.	 You	 walk—do	 not	 run—walk	 to me,	and	we’ll	go	in	together.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	I’ll	wait	for	your	signal,”	Pati	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a>Joe	nodded	and	moved	off.	She	bent	down,	staying	just	high	enough	to	see Joe	over	the	groundcars.	He	moved	past	the	left	side	of	the	terminus	station	and up	 to	 the	 terminal	 entrance.	 Without	 a	 train	 disembarking	 passengers,	 the walkway	to	the	doors	was	empty,	and	he	didn’t	need	much	time	to	spy	the	area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	back	toward	her	and	froze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 saw	 two	 figures,	 a	 little	 taller	 than	 Joe,	 march	 toward	 him	 from	 the terminus	 station.	 She	 guessed	 they	 had	 been	 standing	 by	 the	 platform	 doors, which	 she	 couldn’t	 see	 from	 where	 she	 stood.	 She	 then	 guessed	 it	 was	 an excellent	place	to	station	constables	conducting	a	dragnet.	Joe’s	body	language suggested	she	guessed	correctly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 thought	 she	 could	 run.	 Get	 out	 of	 here	 and	 head	 back	 north	 to	 old Karakorum	 like	 Joe	 originally	 said	 they	 should.	 Except,	 if	 they	 had	 Joe,	 he would	 probably	 confess	 to	 the	 plan.	 Not	 only	 that,	 the	 constables	 would	 know for	sure	she	was	on	the	loose.	She	had	no	illusion	she	could	run	forever	on	this god-forsaken	moon	where	she	had	no	friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	didn’t	like	the	idea	of	running,	anyway.	There	were	only	two	constables, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 she	 and	 Joe	 were	 both	 Earth-born.	 Pati	 moved	 out	 from	 between	 the	 and walked	around	the	terminus	station.	If	she	surprised	the	constables,	she	needed to	 come	 in	 from	 a	 different	 direction	 than	 that	 which	 they	 saw	 Joe	 approach from.	 She	 only	 hoped	 they’d	 still	 be	 there	 after	 the	 minute	 it’d	 take	 to	 walk around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	 she	 was	 out	 of	 their	 line	 of	 sight,	 she	 ran,	 keeping	 low,	 until	 she rounded	 the	 station.	 She	 stood	 up	 and	 approached,	 walking	 along	 another sidewalk.	 They	 were	 questioning	 Joe,	 although	 she	 couldn’t	 make	 out	 exactly what	was	being	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 Joe	 saw	 her.	 She	 knew	 it	 because	 he	 immediately	 looked	 in	 the direction	from	which	he	had	come,	not	in	her	direction.	The	constables	turned	to see	 where	 Joe	 looked,	 and	 she	 approached	 from	 their	 blind	 spot.	 Two	 well-placed	punches	and	these	secgen	constables	would	be	incapacitated.	She’d	watch their	heads	though;	no	reason	to	add	to	her	list	of	accidental	deaths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	she	saw	one	of	their	faces.	He	was	one	of	the	constables	that	stormed</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	 Nancy’s	 office	 during	 her	 argument	 with	 Joe.	 Nancy	 said	 then	 he	 had	 just arrived	from	Earth.	A	well-placed	punch	would	bounce	off	of	his	body.	She	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	only	a	few	steps	away,	and	her	plan	had	failed	before	it	even	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 face	 she	 recognized	 looked	 at	 her	 and	 he	 pointed.	 Pati	 got	 to	 within	 a step	 of	 his	 partner,	 and	 as	 he	 turned	 to	 his	 right,	 she	 relieved	 him	 of	 the tranquilizer	gun	in	his	belt.	She’d	never	used	one	before,	and	it	took	a	moment	to get	a	finger	on	the	trigger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	constable,	certainly	upset	to	have	had	his	weapon	lifted	so	easily,	lunged</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>at	 Pati.	 She	 didn’t	 have	 time	 to	 think	 and	 pulled	 the	 trigger.	 She	 watched	 his expression	 go	 from	 anger	 to	 surprise,	 and	 finally	 to	 incoherence	 in	 less	 than	 a second’s	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	constable	had	his	weapon	out.	But	he	held	his	fire	until	his	partner fell	off	of	Pati.	Her	gun	had	a	clear	shot	before	that	happened,	and	she	pulled	the trigger	three	more	times.	At	least	one	dart	struck	him	because	he	fell	into	a	heap like	his	partner.	She	didn’t	bother	to	watch	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent,”	Joe	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Back	to	the	original	plan?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 you	 were	 right.	 They’re	 looking	 for	 me,	 not	 you.	 We	 have	 to	 go around.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Back	through	the	tunnel.	Let’s	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	followed	him	off	to	the	side,	back	around	the	landscaping	to	the	section</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 building	 where	 the	 spaceport	 construction	 stopped,	 and	 the	 courthouse construction	began.	She	checked	behind	them,	and	nobody	had	followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	 tapped	 the	 wall,	 and	 nothing	 happened.	 He	 tapped	 the	 wall	 again,	 and again	nothing	happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	wrong?”	Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	find	the	tap	pad	that’s	embedded	in	the	wall.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 focused	 on	 the	 areas	 where	 Joe	 tapped.	 There	 seemed	 no	 clue	 where	 a secret	 touch	 pad	 would	 be	 placed,	 as	 should	 be	 the	 case	 if	 it	 was	 to	 remain hidden.	 Except,	 it	 was	 no	 good	 if	 nobody	 could	 find	 it,	 so	 wouldn’t	 there	 be some	clue	as	to	the	location? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	you	find	the	door?”	Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	unless	I	get	it	open.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	recalled	her	grandmother’s	house	in	Ireland.	The	thing	was	built	nearly</p>
<p class="calibre1">two	hundred	years	ago,	and	something	about	it	reminded	her	of	this	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Damn,”	Joe	said.	“We’ll	have	to	try	to	sneak	in	the	front	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 turned	 to	 check	 where	 she’d	 shot	 the	 constables,	 and	 already	 terminal workers	were	attending	to	them.	“No,	we’re	not	going	to	get	in	that	way,”	Pati said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	we’re	caught.	Because	I	have	no	idea	how	to	open	this	door.”	He	sat</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	on	the	crushed	gravel	and	shook	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t	there	another	entrance?	Maybe	for	freight?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Guarded	 full-time	 to	 keep	 smugglers	 from	 moving	 contraband,”	 Joe	 said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	continued	to	shake	his	head	and	then	put	his	right	hand	over	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 refused	 to	 give	 up	 but	 had	 no	 idea	 what	 to	 do.	 Pati	 leaned	 against	 the wall.	Maybe	they	could	go	on	the	run	here.	With	Joe’s	knowledge	of	Karakorum, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>they	 might	 stand	 a	 chance.	 Not	 a	 good	 chance,	 since	 he’d	 given	 up	 already. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow,	she’d	have	to	motivate	him	and	do	it	fast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 tapped	 her	 head	 against	 the	 wall	 as	 she	 thought,	 trying	 to	 find	 ideas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">None	 came	 to	 her,	 except	 her	 grandmother’s	 house.	 Considering	 that	 her grandmother	had	died	a	few	years	ago,	what	possibly	could	her	old	house	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	do	with	their	situation? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	 tapped	 her	 knuckles	 against	 the	 wall.	 She	 tapped	 them	 again	 on	 a different	spot.	The	sound	was	different. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	Joe,	if	I	found	the	door,	would	you	be	able	to	locate	the	touch	pad?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	shrugged,	but	he	didn’t	look	at	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	took	that	as	a	positive,	or	at	least	not	a	negative.	After	her	grandmother died,	Pati	helped	clean	the	house.	Her	father	wanted	to	contract	some	remodeling but	 needed	 to	 locate	 utilities	 that	 weren’t	 diagramed	 in	 the	 ancient	 building’s plans.	He	tapped	walls	until	he	heard	a	hollowness	and	focused	on	that	area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 it	 worked,	 she	 hoped.	 She	 heard	 a	 hollowness	 as	 she	 tapped,	 and	 it continued	 until	 she’d	 traversed	 about	 the	 width	 of	 the	 tunnel	 she	 used	 earlier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	location	was	about	two	meters	from	where	Joe	had	looked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	right	over	here,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	you	know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	trust	me.	Here’s	the	right	side.”	She	tapped	with	her	right	hand.	Then</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	tapped	with	her	left.	“And	here’s	the	other	side.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe’s	 expression	 was	 not	 enthusiastic.	 However,	 he	 got	 up	 and	 moved	 into Pati’s	position.	He	tapped	once,	and	they	heard	the	door	unlatch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Damn,	how	did	you—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	think	about	it,	just	move,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	opened	the	door,	and	they	jumped	in.	The	lights	came	on	right	after	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">closed	 it	 behind	 them.	 “Come	 on,”	 he	 said	 and	 led	 her	 to	 the	 other	 side.	 He stopped	 to	 crack	 the	 last	 door	 and	 inspect	 the	 hallway.	 “It’s	 clear,”	 he	 said	 and bounded	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	followed	him	into	the	empty	hallway.	Joe	let	the	door	close	on	its	own</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	they	heard	the	latches. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	 what?”	 Pati	 asked.	 Being	 back	 where	 she	 started	 did	 not	 give	 her confidence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Into	the	spaceport,”	Joe	said.	He	faced	the	door	and	tapped	the	keypad	next</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	it	for	entry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will	they	know	it’s	you?”	Pati	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 a	 general	 code	 used	 throughout	 the	 spaceport,	 and	 we	 all	 use	 it	 on multiple	doors.	They	won’t	know	it’s	me,	at	least	not	for	a	while.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 door	 opened	 and	 Joe	 led	 her	 through.	 The	 open	 space	 made	 her	 feel</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>vulnerable,	although	there	were	not	many	workers	around	to	threaten	them.	Joe almost	ran	down	the	dark	walkway	leading	to	the	lander	docks.	Most	of	the	slips were	 empty,	 having	 taken	 the	 passengers	 up	 to	 Picus	 for	 the	 workday.	 A	 few were	parked,	and	unmanned,	ready	for	a	fugitive	to	steal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Except,	the	lander	would	not	make	it	past	Picus.	There,	she’d	be	back	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	control	of	Kerry	McLear.	It’d	probably	be	better	to	stay	on	Titan	than	let	that happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	kept	moving.	Soon,	they’d	cleared	the	lander	slips	and	were	walking	past</p>
<p class="calibre1">shuttles,	which	had	greater	range.	They	could	try	to	steal	one,	but	getting	away was	another	matter,	and	where	would	they	go? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	man	stood	behind	one	of	the	shuttles,	and	he	seemed	to	recognize	Joe.	Joe</p>
<p class="calibre1">hurried	toward	him	and	stopped	when	he	got	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 late,”	 the	 man	 said.	 He	 was	 taller	 than	 both	 of	 them	 and	 his	 black hair	was	longer	than	Pati’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gemini,	thanks	for	waiting,”	Joe	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	need	workers,	so	I	figured	I’d	give	you	a	few	minutes	before	I	left.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	we’re	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s	your	friend?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joe	 looked	 at	 Pati.	 “Her	 name’s	 Terri,”	 he	 said.	 He	 looked	 back	 at	 Gemini. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	ready	to	go	or	do	you	want	to	stay	longer	for	introductions?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,	get	in,”	Gemini	said.	He	led	them	into	the	shuttle	and	assigned	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">seats	before	shutting	the	shuttle	door.	The	cabin	contained	about	twenty	seats	in rows	of	four.	Joe	and	Pati	sat	in	front,	on	the	left.	Before	the	shuttle	moved,	Pati had	to	ask.	“Joe,	have	you	been	to	Enceladus	before?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">&lt;&lt;&lt;The	End&gt;&gt;&gt; </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pati	has	escaped	Karakorum	and	the	rigged	trial	that	almost	incarcerated	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	 senior	 citizenship,	 if	 not	 an	 accidental	 execution.	 She’s	 on	 her	 way	 to the	moon	Enceladus,	and	an	ice-mining	colony	where	no	questions	will	be	asked</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	her	past.	However,	such	places	usually	have	secrets	of	their	own	to	hide, and	the	aliens	who	rigged	her	trial	have	their	own	plans	to	execute	there. </p>
