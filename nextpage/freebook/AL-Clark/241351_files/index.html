<p class="calibre1">S <i class="calibre4">tanding	at	the	top	of	a	grass	covered	hill,	with	a	sweet	smelling	breeze	at</i> <i class="calibre4">his	back,	he	reveled	in	the	bright	morning	sunshine	of	a	perfect	spring	day. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Jagged	 heights	 filled	 the	 horizon	 as	 the	 sun	 hoisted	 itself	 up	 and	 kissed	 the</i> <i class="calibre4">mountain	tops. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">In	the	valley	below,	a	small	idyllic	village	was	shaking	off	the	night	and	was</i> <i class="calibre4">well	into	the	process	of	beginning	a	new	day.	The	faraway	villagers	appeared	to</i> <i class="calibre4">be	enjoying	the	day	as	much	as	he. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Someone	was	running	up	the	hill	towards	him,	yelling	something—a	couple</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">of	words	over	and	over;	maybe	a	name,	maybe	a	warning?	He	cupped	his	ears</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">with	his	hands	to	better	hear	what	the	person	was	saying,	but	the	sounds	came</i> <i class="calibre4">muffled	and	distorted;	carried	away	by	the	wind. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The	 person	 got	 closer	 and	 closer,	 arms	 and	 legs	 pumping,	 and	 the	 words</i> <i class="calibre4">began	to	get	clearer	until	just	on	the	verge	of	understanding,	the	scene	turned	a</i> <i class="calibre4">blinding	white	and	then	quickly—faded	to	black. </i></p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	One</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">He	awoke	gradually,	a	little	at	a	time,	swimming	up	from	the	abyss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 eyes	 opened	 to	 near	 total	 darkness,	 and	 all	 he	 saw	 was	 a	 small spot	of	light	directly	overhead.	A	tiny	star	surrounded	by	a	velvety	darkness.	A single	 bright	 dot	 in	 the	 void	 that	 grew	 and	 expanded	 to	 fill	 his	 vision	 until	 he blinked,	and	it	returned	to	a	tiny	pinhole	of	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	could	see	just	enough	to	determine	he	was	lying	in	a	box	not	much	larger</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	his	body.	The	soft	glow	from	the	pinhole	over	his	head	allowed	just	enough light	to	see	cold	dark	metal	surrounding	him.	Somewhere	far	away	an	alarm	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">sounding.	 His	 head	 swung	 back	 and	 forth	 frantically	 trying	 to	 understand,	 and fear	grabbed	at	his	heart	as	a	disturbing	realization	surfaced.  <i class="calibre4">Where	am	I? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Desperately	 he	 raised	 his	 arms	 and	 pressed	 hard	 on	 the	 surface	 above	 him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	felt	a	slight	shift	to	his	right,	so	he	concentrated	his	efforts	on	that	side.	His fear	made	him	strong,	and	with	surprising	speed	the	lid	flew	open	on	concealed</p>
<p class="calibre1">hinges	 and	 bounced	 off	 something—only	 to	 slam	 closed	 again.	 For	 part	 of	 a second,	he	managed	a	glimpse	of	a	small	gray	room	and	an	oval	metal	door	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	few	feet	beyond	the	end	of	the	box. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	second	attempt	to	free	himself,	using	less	effort,	was	rewarded	with	the	lid</p>
<p class="calibre1">swinging	 to	 the	 side	 and	 remaining	 open.	 The	 distant	 alarm	 outside	 the	 metal box	 changed	 to	 a	 loud	 screech	 as	 the	 man	 eased	 himself	 into	 a	 sitting	 position and	tried	to	make	sense	of	his	surroundings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 a	 small	 and	 utilitarian	 room,	 a	 cubby	 hole	 with	 barely	 enough	 room for	the	silver	metal	box.	The	lighting	was	minimal,	leaving	details	fuzzy,	but	it appeared	this	room	was	designed	specifically	for	the	box.	Behind	him,	a	control panel	 with	 insistent	 flashing	 lights	 and	 that	 annoying	 alarm	 blared	 on	 the	 back wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyes	began	to	adjust	to	the	low-level	lighting	and	allowed	a	closer	look</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	the	unfamiliar	place	he	found	himself.	The	box	was	in	the	center	of	the	room with	barely	five	feet	of	space	surrounding	it.	A	dull	gray	color	dominated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	annoying	alarm	fed	his	dull	throbbing	headache	and	was	quickly	turning</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 into	 a	 raging	 pain	 in	 his	 head.	 He	 reached	 around	 and	 inspected	 the	 control panel.	 To	 one	 side	 was	 a	 switch	 marked	 ALARM	 RESET.	 He	 reached	 up	 and pressed	 it,	 and	 the	 room	 fell	 into	 silence.	 That	 was	 much	 better.	 Now	 he	 could think. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>The	 room	 was	 unadorned.	 The	 door,	 the	 control	 panel,	 and	 a	 small	 pair	 of cabinet	 doors	 on	 the	 wall	 opposite	 of	 the	 steps	 were	 the	 only	 features.	 On	 the side	 of	 the	 box	 there	 appeared	 to	 be	 lettering.	 Unfortunately,	 the	 letters	 were faded	to	the	point	of	being	unreadable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	attire	consisted	of	an	off-white	uniform	of	some	kind;	with	long	sleeves, </p>
<p class="calibre1">creased	trousers,	and	small	golden	buttons.	A	pair	of	black	deck	boots	completed the	outfit	that	could	be	considered	military,	or	maybe	medical.	The	clothing	was not	in	the	least	familiar	to	him.	He	checked	his	pockets	one	by	one,	and	found</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	empty,	with	no	clues	leading	to	answers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Waking	in	a	box,	disoriented	and	confused,	not	knowing	where	you	were	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">how	you	came	to	be	there—is	the	stuff	of	nightmares.	None	of	this	made	sense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 stared	 at	 the	 door,	 puzzling	 over	 where	  <i class="calibre4">here</i>	 was	 and	 had	 a	 revelation	 that took	this	bad	dream	to	a	whole	new	level.	Try	as	he	might,	he	could	not	recall</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	name.  <i class="calibre4">Who	am	I? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">He	struggled	to	remember	anything	about	himself	and	came	up	with	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	memories	were	just	not	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	climbed	out	of	the	box	and	found	three	small	steps	leading	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">floor.	 Out	 of	 the	 bottom	 of	 the	 box,	 several	 dull	 colored	 pipes	 could	 be	 seen disappearing	 into	 the	 floor.	 He	 wondered	 if	 the	 box	 was	 some	 form	 of	 life support	system. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 sound	 of	 his	 boots	 echoed	 in	 the	 small	 space	 when	 he	 stepped	 over	 to puzzle	over	the	small	cabinet	doors.	There	was	a	keypad	to	the	right	of	the	doors beside	a	glowing	red	indicator	light.	He	punched	in	a	few	numbers,	but	nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened.	The	doors	were	locked	and	would	not	open	without	the	proper	code. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 turned	 and	 stood	 in	 front	 of	 the	 oval	 hatch	 that	 served	 as	 a	 door,	 and triggered	 a	 sensor,	 causing	 it	 to	 slide	 silently	 into	 the	 wall.	 When	 the	 door opened,	 a	 slight	 breath	 of	 fresh	 air	 blew	 past	 his	 face.	 He	 stepped	 over	 the threshold	 and	 looked	 left,	 and	 then	 right,	 to	 discover	 a	 long,	 empty	 corridor going	both	ways;	dimly	lit,	and	circling	slightly	upward	out	of	sight.	Ten	feet	tall and	 ten	 feet	 wide	 with	 a	 curved	 ceiling,	 the	 passageway	 had	 six-foot	 portals placed	on	both	sides	every	fifteen	or	twenty	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	corridor	and	doors	were	a	neutral	gray	color,	with	a	faded	orange	stripe</p>
<p class="calibre1">above	the	doors	on	both	sides;	now	dull	and	without	luster.	His	guess	attributed the	striping	to	an	indication	of	sections	or	areas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next	to	each	entrance	were	faded	peeling	letters,	such	as	LQ26...LQ27,	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">even	 numbers	 on	 the	 left	 and	 odd	 numbers	 to	 the	 right.	 He	 turned	 around	 and looked	 closely	 at	 the	 lettering	 on	 the	 door	 he	 just	 came	 through.	 It	 was	 barely readable,	 and	 appeared	 to	 be	 Albert,	 or	 Alvin	 maybe;	 Al—something—Clark, with	the	number	25	below	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a> <i class="calibre4">If	this	is	Al	Clark’s	room,	does	that	mean	I	am	Al	Clark? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 decided	 that	 going	 left	 was	 as	 good	 as	 going	 right,	 so	 he	 moved	 to	 the first	door	to	his	left,	marked	LQ26,	and	pressed	a	small	button	on	the	right	side of	the	hatch.	The	barrier	slid	silently	into	the	wall	revealing	a	dark	room.	As	he walked	 inside,	 there	 was	 a	 soft	 ‘click,'	 and	 hidden	 lighting	 lit	 up	 a	 room	 much larger	 than	 the	 one	 he	 just	 left;	 although	 there	 was	 no	 wasted	 space.	 The	 room was	tinted	a	faded	yellow	with	a	curved	ceiling	that	started	above	the	door	and arced	down	to	end	at	the	far	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	presence	of	a	door	inside	told	him	there	was	more	than	one	room.	In	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">first	room	was	a	double	bed,	a	table,	and	a	small	desk	with	a	computer	terminal mounted	on	the	wall	above	it.	He	crossed	to	the	terminal	thinking	it	might	help with	his	questions,	but	pressing	the	ON	button	had	no	effect.	In	the	center	of	the simple	room	stood	a	multi-purpose	round	table	and	two	chairs	locked	in	notches</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 other	 room	 was	 a	 complete	 bathroom	 with	 a	 stand-up	 shower,	 a	 small sink,	and	a	toilet.	The	apartment	had	everything	one	might	need	to	fill	the	basic requirements	of	a	couple.	With	a	few	modifications,	maybe	a	small	family.	Both</p>
<p class="calibre1">rooms	were	empty,	with	no	sign	of	personal	belongings	or	previous	occupation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 looked	 as	 if	 these	 rooms	 had	 been	 unoccupied	 for	 many	 years,	 with	 no brightness	to	the	color,	and	no	shiny	surfaces	to	reflect	the	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Above	the	sink	in	the	bathroom	was	a	clouded	metal	mirror	that	showed	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">reflection	 of	 a	 man	 in	 his	 early	 forties,	 six	 foot	 tall,	 with	 short	 brown	 hair	 and haunted	 blue	 eyes.	 It	 was	 an	 ordinary	 looking	 stranger’s	 reflection	 that	 did nothing	 to	 tell	 him	 his	 identity.	 He	 didn’t	 remember	 hitting	 his	 head,	 but	 there was	a	tiny	drop	of	dried	blood	in	the	middle	of	his	forehead.	He	wiped	it	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	his	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 little	 overwhelmed,	 he	 went	 back	 to	 the	 main	 room	 and	 sat	 down	 on	 the bed	 to	 think.	 These	 accommodations	 did	 not	 look	 worn;	 these	 rooms	 looked unused	and	old.	No	scuffed	corners	or	marks	of	wear	on	the	floor.	There	were	no papers	that	littered	the	room;	no	books	on	the	desk,	no	bedding	covered	the	bed, and	 the	 bathroom	 appeared	 old	 and	 never	 used.	 These	 living	 quarters	 were	 all ready	to	move	into	and	never	occupied.  <i class="calibre4">Why	build	all	this,	and	never	use	it? </i> A short	time	later,	he	got	up	and	returned	to	the	corridor.	He	left	the	room	and	was standing	outside	when	there	was	a	soft	 <i class="calibre4">‘click,' </i>	the	overhead	lighting	returned	to its	 long	 held	 off	 state,	 and	 the	 door	 closed	 automatically.	 He	 wondered,  <i class="calibre4">Where</i> <i class="calibre4">are	all	the	people? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 made	 his	 way	 down	 the	 passageway,	 tripping	 the	 lighting	 into	 other rooms	 and	 found	 similar	 quarters;	 each	 tinted	 a	 different	 soft	 color.	 Some	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>three	rooms,	but	all	were	empty	and	forgotten.	Eventually,	he	found	himself	at	a large	hatch	blocking	any	further	travel	down	the	corridor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beside	 the	 door,	 a	 large	 sign	 declared:	 ACCESS	 TO	 BLUE	 SECTION	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">SPOKE	 4	 LIFT.	 Directly	 below	 the	 sign	 was	 a	 small	 control	 panel	 with	 a	 card reader	slot	and	two	indicator	lights;	a	green	light	labeled	OK	TO	OPEN	was	lit, and	a	red	one	with	text	that	read	DO	NOT	OPEN,	was	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 center	 of	 the	 hatch	 was	 a	 small	 round	 window	 with	 thick	 plastic	 or glass	that	he	wiped	with	his	sleeve,	allowing	him	to	see	into	a	round	room	about twenty	feet	across,	with	a	faded	ten-foot	red	circle	painted	in	the	center.	On	the far	 side	 of	 this	 transition	 space	 was	 an	 identical	 door	 and	 window;	 leading	 to another	corridor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 card	 slot	 told	 him	 a	 key	 card	 was	 needed	 to	 open	 the	 hatch	 and	 gain access	to	the	space	beyond.	After	thinking	for	a	moment,	he	turned	around	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">hurried	back	to	end	up	at	the	other	end	of	the	corridor.	This	one	section	of	the passageway,	 from	 large	 exit	 door	 to	 large	 exit	 door,	 was	 easily	 a	 thousand	 feet long,	so	it	took	him	a	few	minutes	to	get	to	the	opening	at	the	other	end.	When he	arrived,	he	found	a	key	card	was	needed	to	gain	access	to	this	door	also.	He was	 trapped	 in	 this	 section	 of	 the	 passageway	 and	 had	 traded	 his	 small	 man-sized	prison	for	a	larger	one;	with	rooms. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Now...Where	in	this	place	can	I	get	a	key	card? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Thinking	back,	he	could	remember	only	one	location	where	he	might	find	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">item	 as	 important	 as	 a	 key	 card.	 The	 locked	 cabinet	 in	 ‘Al	 Clark’s’	 room.	 He needed	to	return	to	the	place	where	he	started	and	attempt	to	access	the	storage compartment.	It	was	the	best	option	available. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back	 in	 the	 room	 he	 woke	 up	 in,	 he	 stood	 before	 the	 keypad	 next	 to	 the cabinet	 and	 considered	 the	 code	 required	 to	 unlock	 the	 cabinet	 doors.	 It	 was probably	four	or	five	digits;	something	memorable	for	the	owner.	Depending	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	it	secured,	and	the	person	that	programmed	it,	the	code	could	be	devilishly complicated	or	as	simple	as	1234.	He	tapped	in	1-2-3-4.	That	wasn’t	it.	He	tried 1-1-1-1.	Not	it	either.	He	attempted	several	different	combinations,	and	none	of them	worked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	only	thing	he	knew	for	certain	about	this	place	was	the	lettering	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">door:	 <i class="calibre4">Al—Clark-25.	If	A	=	1,	and	C	=	3,	if	you	added	twenty-five	to	the	end,	the</i> <i class="calibre4">combination	 would	 be	 1-3-2-5. </i> To	 his	 amazement,	 when	 he	 tried	 this	 solution there	was	a	faint	‘click,'	and	the	two	cabinet	doors	popped	open.	A	small	smile crept	onto	his	face	as	he	opened	the	doors,	and	he	thought,  <i class="calibre4">I	would	never	have</i> <i class="calibre4">bet	on	that	to	work. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside,	 there	 was	 the	 key	 card	 he	 needed;	 complete	 with	 a	 cord	 to	 hang around	his	neck,	a	small	set	of	old-fashioned	looking	keys,	and	a	handgun	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>holster.	He	reached	up	and	took	down	the	weapon.	When	he	wrapped	his	hand around	the	grip,	it	felt	comfortable	and	familiar	in	his	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly,	pieces	began	to	come	back	to	him.	A	puzzle	of	fragmented	thoughts</p>
<p class="calibre1">pulled	themselves	together,	and	he	realized	that	he	knew	what	this	weapon	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	modulated	laser	pistol,	commonly	referred	to	as	an	MLP. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 this,	 someone	 could	 blow	 tiny	 holes	 in	 anything	 that	 wasn’t	 hardened metal.	Mostly	for	security,	it	was	the	weapon	of	choice	for	air-tight	facilities—</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	he	knew	how	to	use	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still	smiling,	he	hung	the	card	around	his	neck	and	put	the	keys	in	his	pants</p>
<p class="calibre1">pocket.	 The	 pistol’s	 power	 pack	 was	 depleted	 and	 needed	 recharging,	 but	 he clipped	 it	 to	 his	 belt	 thinking	 there	 must	 be	 somewhere	 around	 here	 where	 it could	be	charged,	or	the	power	packed	replaced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	no	idea	who	he	was,	or	where	he	was,	and	believed	the	card	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">help	lead	him	to	some	understanding.	The	small	plastic	rectangle	could	very	well be	his	ticket	to	the	answers	he	so	deeply	needed. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Two</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">He	exited	the	room,	turned	left,	and	walked	back	down	the	corridor	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hatch	that	required	a	key	card.	Along	the	way,	he	pulled	the	little	plastic</p>
<p class="calibre1">rectangle	 from	 his	 pocket	 and	 took	 a	 closer	 look	 at	 it.	 On	 one	 side	 was emblazoned	 a	 single	 word	  <i class="calibre4">Excalibur</i>.	 On	 the	 back	 was	 a	 place	 for	 a	 name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,	it	was	not	filled	in.	Seemingly	random	letters	and	numbers	filled	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	bottom.	The	card	was	a	generic	card	that	could	be	programmed	to	allow	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">recipient	access	to	specific	areas,	except	this	recipient	had	not	bothered	to	fill	in the	name.	Efficient	and	nonproprietary,	this	access	card	provided	few	clues. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	card	worked,	though,	and	it	opened	the	hatch	into	the	room	at	the	end	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 corridor	 separating	 the	 two	 passageways.	 Once	 inside,	 he	 noticed	 a	 similar control	panel	on	the	inside	of	each	hatch	and	another	in-between	the	two	doors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 openings	 had	 faded	 signs	 stating:	 ACCESS	 TO	 ORANGE	 SECTION,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">ACCESS	 TO	 BLUE	 SECTION.	 The	 central	 control	 panel	 sign	 was	 labeled:</p>
<p class="calibre1">SPOKE	 4	 LIFT.	 The	 doors	 leading	 to	 the	 passageway	 had	 the	 accompanying safety	lights,	indicating	if	the	door	was	safe	to	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	passed	on	through	what	he	was	beginning	to	believe	was	an	airlock,	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	other	passageway	and	found	it	very	similar	to	the	one	he	just	left;	except	the stripe	above	the	doors	was	a	soft	blue.	Most	doors	were	labeled	LQ...something, with	 the	 numbers	 increasing	 as	 he	 went	 down	 the	 corridor.	 A	 few	 doors	 were labeled	 UTILITY,	 which	 usually	 contained	 cleaning	 supplies	 and	 assorted equipment.	When	he	came	to	a	door	marked	MESS	HALL,	he	grinned.	Almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">everyone	 knew	 what	 a	 MESS	 Hall	 was—food!	 He	 walked	 in,	 and	 the	 door closed	silently	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	fairly	large	room,	and	designed	for	food	consumption,	with	room	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">seventy-five	to	a	hundred	people	to	eat	at	the	same	time.	All	along	one	side	was a	counter	with	recesses	to	display	a	variety	of	foods.	In	a	back	storage	area,	he found	sealed	boxes	full	of	various	packaged	meals,	and	a	user-friendly	device	for heating	the	pre-made	packets.	He	warmed	one	at	random,	and	quickly	opened	it; </p>
<p class="calibre1">squeezing	the	food	labeled	Meatloaf	and	Potatoes	into	his	mouth.	The	taste	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">bland.	Still,	it	helped	him	to	feel	better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	water	from	the	tap	behind	the	counter	ran	a	little	grayish	for	a	minute	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	until	it	turned	relatively	clear.	He	stuck	his	head	under	the	faucet	and	sipped</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>from	the	bottom	of	the	tap.	The	tepid	drink	tasted	a	little	like	metal	but	quenched his	thirst. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The	water	must	be	a	closed	system	and	continually	recycled. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">With	his	need	for	food	and	water	satisfied,	the	man	moved	out	of	the	mess</p>
<p class="calibre1">hall	and	headed	towards	the	door	at	the	end	of	the	corridor.	He	would	remember</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	place:	Blue	Section	=	Food. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 continued	 his	 explorations	 until	 he	 reached	 the	 end	 of	 the	 blue	 section. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again,	 there	 was	 the	 transition	 room	 between	 the	 corridors.	 The	 inside	 of	 this chamber	was	identical	to	the	one	between	the	orange	and	blue	sections.	In	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">case,	it	was	an	airlock	for	access	to	the	blue	section,	the	green	section,	and	spoke lift	three. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	hatch	to	the	green	corridor	did	not	display	a	green	light.	On	the	control</p>
<p class="calibre1">panel	was	a	bright	glowing	red	light	that	warned—DO	NOT	OPEN.	Through	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">round	 window	 of	 the	 hatch	 leading	 to	 the	 green	 corridor,	 the	 reason	 for	 the ominous	 crimson	 light	 became	 apparent.	 Beyond	 the	 sealed	 barrier	 a	 large section	 of	 the	 passageway	 was	 missing,	 leaving	 the	 passage	 beyond	 open	 to space.	The	corridor	had	a	hole	passing	through	it;	where	stars	were	visible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	stars	told	him	he	was	in	space,	possibly	in	the	centrifugal	gravity	ring	of a	space	station,	or	a	large	ship.	It	did	not	matter	that	the	passageway	lights	were out	beyond	the	window,	the	starlight	told	him	all	he	needed	to	know.	Thirty	feet past	 the	 door	 was	 a	 large	 ragged	 hole	 through	 the	 center	 of	 the	 corridor.	 There was	no	going	beyond	this	point	without	a	space	suit.	Now	he	wondered	just	how</p>
<p class="calibre1">many	sections	were	damaged. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Was	this	place	abandoned	for	a	reason? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 returned	 to	 the	 orange	 corridor,	 back	 to	 where	 his	 day	 started	 and contemplated	 what	 he	 knew.	 He	 had	 awakened	 in	 a	 box	 in	 a	 room	 labeled Al...  <i class="calibre4">something</i>...Clark.	 His	 clothing	 consisted	 of	 a	 uniform,	 and	 somehow	 he knew	 how	 to	 use	 an	 MLP	 handgun.	 The	 station	 seemed	 empty	 of	 people, appeared	old,	but	at	the	same	time	unused.	The	ring	must	still	be	rotating,	or	he wouldn’t	 have	 gravity.	 There	 was	 food	 and	 water	 in	 the	 mess	 hall	 for	 a	 large number	of	people,	and	in	the	areas	he	had	been	through,	there	was	living	space</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	at	least	two-hundred	people.	To	add	to	the	mystery,	he	had	not	found	a	single working	computer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	took	him	almost	an	hour	to	get	to	the	end	of	the	orange	corridor.	He	took</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	time	and	investigated	areas	he	had	run	by	before	and	noticed	several	places he’d	 missed	 in	 his	 rush	 to	 get	 information.	 There	 were	 several	 doors	 marked UTILITY,	and	some	keyed	doors	marked	MAINTENANCE.	His	card	worked	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	doors	also,	and	inside	he	found	electrical	equipment,	HVAC	equipment.	A</p>
<p class="calibre1">few	had	workstations	with	tools	neatly	displayed	and	secured. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>In	the	orange	section,	he	found	a	security	office,	with	several	interconnected rooms	and	even	a	holding	cell;	waiting	for	its	first	jailbird.	On	a	long	table	in	a back	room,	he	discovered	a	place	to	charge	the	power	pack	for	his	pistol. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	a	line	of	fully	charged	cells,	he	swapped	the	dead	battery	pack	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">weapon	for	a	charged	pack	and	watched	as	the	power	indicator	went	from	red	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">green,	 indicating	 a	 full	 charge.	 He	 checked	 the	 safety	 and	 pushed	 the	 switch from	 red	 to	 green,	 placing	 it	 in	 the	 safe	 mode.	 Being	 armed,	 for	 some	 reason, was	reassuring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	card	had	not	failed	to	open	any	doors	except	the	one	that	would	put	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	a	corridor	open	to	space.	He	did	not	even	 <i class="calibre4">try</i>	his	card	on	that	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	finally	reached	the	airlock	at	the	other	end	of	the	orange	section,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">went	 through	 to	 the	 passage	 marked	 YELLOW	 SECTION.	 Nearly	 identical	 to the	other	passageways,	he	followed	it	to	the	next	airlock	and	found	that	insistent red	light	on	the	panel	leading	into	the	green	part	of	the	ring. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Okay,	there	are	four	parts	to	the	ring:	orange,	blue,	green,	and	yellow.	Only</i> <i class="calibre4">the	 green	 section	 was	 open	 to	 space.	 That	 would	 mean	 there	 must	 be	 four</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">‘spokes.' </i>	It	was	time	to	see	where	the	spoke	lifts	would	take	him. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
HIS	EXPLORATIONS	WERE	beginning	to	wear	on	him.	It	had	been	a	long	day, <p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">but	 he	 was	 determined	 to	 get	 as	 much	 information	 as	 he	 could	 before	 he	 slept. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 didn’t	 like	 the	 idea	 of	 trying	 to	 access	 a	 spoke	 lift	 when	 one	 of	 the	 doors showed	a	glowing	red	light,	so	he	returned	to	the	airlock	between	the	yellow	and orange	section	that	was	red	light	free. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	center	control	panel	was	labeled:	ACCESS	TO	SPOKE	4,	and	on	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 standard	 red	 and	 green	 indicator	 lights.	 Below	 the	 control	 panel,	 bold lettering	cautioned,	STAND	OUTSIDE	RED	CIRCLE.	He	was	standing	outside</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	circle.	Still,	he	hesitated	for	a	second	before	sliding	the	card	through	the	slot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somewhere	above	him	came	a	series	of	 <i class="calibre4">thunks</i>,	and	in	the	center	of	the	ceiling two	halves	of	a	circle	retracted	to	open	a	passage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through	this	hole	in	the	ceiling	descended	what	looked	like	a	large	capsule. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	conveyance	like	no	transport	capsule	he’d	ever	seen	before.	Although	he	could tell	 it	 was	 old	 by	 its	 dull	 coloring	 and	 cloudy	 windows,	 it	 was	 still	 a	 thing	 of beauty.	Twelve	feet	tall	and	eight	feet	around,	it	was	smooth	and	streamlined.	A triumph	of	technology.	The	entire	middle	section	was	clear	plastic,	except	for	a man-sized	access	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 cautiously	 stepped	 into	 the	 capsule,	 and	 the	 interior	 lights	  <i class="calibre4">‘clicked’	 </i> on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 inside	 of	 the	 compartment	 was	 empty,	 except	 for	 the	 simple	 controller	 on</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>the	wall	with	a	button	for	the	door	and	a	card	slot	to	activate	the	lift. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	center	of	the	capsule—was	a	tree.	Four	inches	around	and	topped	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">four	 short	 branches	 at	 shoulder	 height.	 Age	 had	 turned	 it	 a	 dull	 green,	 with yellow	 highlights	 that	 created	 what	 some	 might	 call	 sculpture	 in	 a	 stark environment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wondered,  <i class="calibre4">is	it	form	or	is	it	function? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 door	 closed	 automatically	 as	 soon	 as	 he	 used	 the	 card	 and	 a	 dull vibration	 could	 be	 felt	 through	 the	 floor	 as	 the	 capsule	 started	 slowly	 rising, gaining	speed	as	it	went.	The	pale	silver	walls	of	the	spoke	slid	rapidly	by,	and as	the	capsule	shot	up,	he	noticed	his	card	beginning	to	float	from	his	chest.	He had	an	idea	of	what	was	coming	next,	so	he	grabbed	for	the	tree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 feeling	 was	 something	 he	 knew.	 It	 seemed	 he	 was	 familiar	 with	 zero gravity.	The	tree	was	the	perfect	handhold	to	keep	him	from	floating	around	and causing	himself	harm.  <i class="calibre4">Functional	as	well	as	beautiful</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ride	to	this	point	had	been	smooth	and	silent,	but	as	he	approached	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">top	of	the	spoke,	and	the	lift	started	slowing	down,	the	vibration	intensified	as	if it	were	struggling.	He	was	just	beginning	to	worry	when	the	capsule	slid	out	of the	spoke	and	ground	to	a	halt—into	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyes	gradually	adjusted,	and	he	spied	far	away	lights	slowly	moving	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	distance;	both	in	front	and	behind.	To	his	side	were	stationary	lights	similar to	the	other	beacons.	A	door	closed	below	him	and	allowed	the	distant	lights	to appear	 more	 distinct.	 When	 his	 eyes	 adjusted;	 he	 could	 see	 well	 enough	 to determine	his	whereabouts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 appeared	 to	 be	 inside	 a	 giant	 metal	 ball,	 as	 seen	 from	 the	 inside,	 easily one	hundred	feet	across.	The	lights	he	saw	were	the	indicator	lights	of	the	other spoke	lifts	as	they	rotated	slowly	around.	On	each	side,	the	vague	outline	of	two stationary	doors	beckoned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	 delay	 his	 search	 did	 not	 enter	 his	 mind.	 It	 was	 now	 time	 to	 get	 some answers.	With	one	hand	holding	the	tree,	he	reached	out	and	pressed	the	button</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	open	the	door.	Bright	lighting	quickly	ramped	up	outside	the	capsule	until	he could	see	the	immense	open	space	at	the	center	of	the	huge	wheel.	The	 <i class="calibre4">Hub</i>	of the	ring.	He	floated	out	of	the	capsule	and	turned,	to	find	a	boy	hanging	onto	a recessed	handle;	just	floating	there	with	wide	open	eyes	staring	straight	at	him. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Three</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	boy	made	no	effort	to	move,	and	the	look	on	his	face	was	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">complete	surprise.	His	voice	squeaked	a	little	at	first	until	he	finally	forced out,	“Are	you...real?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	laughed	and	shook	his	head.	He	said,	“Are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 young	 man	 was	 relatively	 clean,	 with	 blue	 coveralls,	 long	 blonde	 hair, brown	eyes,	and	a	 <i class="calibre4">big</i>	smile.	He	was	around	eighteen,	and	maybe	a	little	taller than	the	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 boy	 told	 him,	 “My	 hibernation	 pod	 malfunctioned	 almost	 a	 year	 ago, and	I’ve	been	waiting	for	someone	to	show	up	ever	since.	I	can’t	tell	you	how</p>
<p class="calibre1">glad	I	am	to	see	you.	I’m	Christopher	Morris...who	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	for	the	time	being,	I	guess	you	can	call	me	Al.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Umm,	Al...what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Clark...Al	 Clark.”	 He	 looked	 down,	 chuckled	 and	 said,	 “It’s	 a	 long	 story, Christopher.	For	now,	how	about	you	tell	me	about	yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Christopher	was	lonely	and	talkative.	He	suggested	they	go	to	the	quarters	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	using	in	the	yellow	section	to	sit	down	and	talk.	Al	pushed	off	and	floated towards	the	capsule	he	rode	up	in	when	the	young	man	stopped	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 wouldn’t	 use	 that	 lift	 if	 I	 were	 you—it	 doesn’t	 sound	 right.	 I	 use	 the number	one	lift.	Two	and	three	won’t	work	because	the	doors	are	overridden	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">locked,	so	one	is	the	only	lift	that	works	as	it	should.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	considered	the	vibration	he	felt	on	his	way	up,	and	decided	he	didn’t	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	number	four	capsule	either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	boy	chose	one	of	the	larger	living	quarters	with	three	rooms,	close	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">number	one	spoke	because	he	liked	hanging	out	in	the	zero	gravity	of	the	hub;	to help	 him	 relax,	 he	 said.	 He	 wasn’t	 worried	 about	 housekeeping	 in	 his	 quarters, and	it	showed,	to	the	point	where	Al	had	to	move	some	things	to	sit	across	from him	at	the	small	table.	The	boy	offered	him	an	energy	bar	to	which	he	declined, and	they	began	talking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	biggest	question	on	Al’s	mind	was,	“Where	are	we,	Christopher?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please,	call	me	Chris,	and	right	now	we	are	in	a	habitat	ring	located	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">front	of	a	spaceship	called	the	 <i class="calibre4">Excalibur</i>.	You	don’t	know	where	you	are?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	figured	out	I	was	in	space,	and	on	what	seems	to	be	an	abandoned	space</p>
<p class="calibre1">ship	or	a	space	station.	What	I	don’t	know—is	where.	Let	me	ask	you	this.	Do	I</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>look	familiar	to	you?	I	mean,	have	you	seen	me	before?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	took	a	close	look	at	Al	and	replied,	“You	don’t	look	familiar,	but	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">rushed	me	onto	the	ship	at	the	last	minute,	and	I	didn’t	meet	many	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al’s	 disappointment	 was	 evident.	 He	 took	 a	 deep	 breath	 and	 said,	 “Okay,	 I guess	I	need	to	explain	why	it	is	I’m	so	clueless.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 told	 Chris	 about	 waking	 up	 in	 the	 box,	 not	 knowing	 where	 or	 who	 he was,	 and	 about	 his	 excursions	 so	 far,	 up	 until	 the	 time	 he	 found	 Chris	 staring back	at	him	across	the	hub. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Al	finished,	Chris	told	his	story	about	how	he	was	thrown	out	of	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">hibernation	 pod	 to	 an	 empty	 habitat	 ring.	 For	 the	 better	 part	 of	 a	 year,	 he	 had almost	gone	crazy	living	by	himself	and	trying	to	stay	busy.	A	seemingly	endless number	of	long	days	and	longer	nights.	He	now	knew	the	ship	like	the	back	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	hand	and	spent	extended	periods	of	time	exploring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	jumped	up	and	grabbed	something	from	the	bed	and	gave	it	to	Al.	“I</p>
<p class="calibre1">started	a	journal.	I	missed	the	first	two	days	and	made	an	entry	every	day	since.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	thumbed	through	the	eight	by	ten	notebook	and	found	it	surprisingly	easy</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	read,	complete	with	intricate	drawings	covering	a	broad	spectrum	of	subjects. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	map	of	the	interior	of	the	habitat	ring	was	laid	out	in	detail.	“These	sketches are	good	Chris.	I	am	impressed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	else	did	I	have	to	do?	Some	of	those	drawings	took	up	weeks	of	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">time,”	the	boy	joked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	 described	 the	 room	 where	 he	 awoke,	 and	 Al	 thought	 it	 sounded	 a	 lot like	the	cubicle	that	held	his	coffin-like	box. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	 was	 told	 there	 were	 a	 thousand	 people	 aboard	 the	 Excalibur.	 He admitted	he	didn’t	know	for	sure,	as	he	had	been	rushed	in	to	fill	a	last	minute cancellation,	and	had	seen	little	of	the	ship.	He	believed	the	person	he	replaced must	have	died	before	he	could	get	aboard	the	starship	because	the	lottery	they held	included	hundreds-of-thousands	of	applicants	from	all	over	the	Earth.	If	you had	a	hundred	dollars	and	could	pass	the	strict	physical	and	psychological	tests, you	 had	 a	 chance.	 Finally,	 one-thousand	 people	 were	 picked	 by	 the	 Excalibur committee	to	be	aboard	the	ship	when	it	left.	The	lucky	ones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Earth	had	become	a	difficult	place	to	live;	due	to	runaway	global	climate</p>
<p class="calibre1">change	and	its	effects.	There	were	wars	all	over	the	planet	making	it	seem	like half	the	world	was	always	fighting	someone	for	something.	Many	people	wanted</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	go	to	a	place	like	the	planets	described	in	the	lottery	brochures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	had	a	limited	access	card	that	didn’t	work	all	the	doors.	Because	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">limited	access,	he	was	unable	to	get	past	the	hub	to	the	rest	of	the	ship.	He	was trapped	in	the	giant	wheel	and	spent	his	time	exploring	the	habitat	ring	when	he wasn’t	relaxing	in	the	ring’s	center	because	of	the	zero-gravity. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>He	 was	 in	 the	 hub	 when	 the	 meteor	 shower	 took	 out	 the	 green	 section	 just two	days	ago,	and	it	almost	scared	him	to	death.	He	told	Al	the	ring	could	handle small	 rocks	 because	 it	 was	 self-healing,	 but	 the	 big	 ones	 were	 unstoppable	 and made	a	racket	inside	the	ship	that	is	unimaginable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	sat	back	and	thought,  <i class="calibre4">Could	it	be	the	meteor	shower	that	woke	me? </i>	 His thoughts	 were	 sluggish;	 fragmented.	 If	 it	  <i class="calibre4">had</i>	 been	 two	 days	 since	 he	 slept,	 he needed	to	rest.	Al	considered	whether	he	should	move	into	quarters	of	his	own, </p>
<p class="calibre1">or	help	Chris	clean	this	one.	To	simplify	their	future	planning,	he	decided	to	help Chris.	The	boy	was	happy	to	oblige. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later,	with	Al	just	about	to	fall	asleep	in	one	room,	and	Chris	in	the	other,	Al called	out	through	the	open	door,	“If	this	is	a	colony	ship,	where	are	we	going?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 <i class="calibre4">were</i>	on	a	thirty-year	journey	to	a	planet	called	Avalon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thirty	years,	huh?	To	colonize?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	that	was	the	plan.” </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
THE	NEXT	MORNING,	AFTER	taking	turns	getting	showers,	they	dressed	and<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">headed	for	the	mess	hall	in	the	blue	section.	They	each	grabbed	a	food	package, heated	them	up,	and	took	the	food	to	a	table	to	eat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sitting	 and	 talking	 at	 one	 of	 the	 many	 empty	 tables,	 they	 agreed	 that somewhere	on	this	ship	there	were	people,	either	dead	or	alive.	Anxious	to	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">moving,	they	finished	their	meals	and	headed	to	the	hub	to	find	them.	While	they walked	to	the	number	one	lift,	Chris	filled	Al	in	on	what	he	knew	of	the	mission and	their	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 ship,	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Excalibur</i>,	 left	 earth	 orbit	 in	 2160.	 It	 was	 decided	 by	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘people	in	charge,'	that	all	colonists	and	crew	would	be	put	into	hibernation	until three	 months	 before	 the	 ship	 established	 orbit	 around	 the	 planet;	 to	 minimize resource	 usage.	 At	 that	 time	 the	 crew	 was	 to	 be	 awakened,	 and	 then	 a	 team	 of specialists	 would	 begin	 waking	 the	 scientists.	 Finally,	 the	 colonists	 would	 be revived.	 When	 we	 arrived	 at	 Avalon,	 we	 would	 have	 been	 ready	 to	 assess	 the planet,	and	send	people	down	to	set	up	housing	almost	right	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">None	of	what	Chris	said	jogged	any	memories.	It	was	like	a	science	fiction</p>
<p class="calibre1">story	he’d	never	read. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	continued,	“The	habitat	ring	was	to	be	used	to	house	the	people	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">revival	until	planetfall,	and	then	for	the	subsequent	operations.	The	ship	is	fully automated,	and	the	computer	was	programmed	to	wake	the	crew	when	ready	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	there	was	an	emergency.	I	guess	that	didn’t	work	out	so	well.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>Something	 had	 gone	 wrong,	 and	 Chris	 and	 Al	 were	 either	 the	 first	 to	 wake up	or	the	last	ones	alive.	A	forty-something	amnesiac,	and	an	eighteen-year-old kid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	 continued,	 “When	 they	 first	 discovered	 Avalon	 with	 one	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">telescopes	in	orbit	around	the	moon,	it	was	considered	a	pretty	significant	find. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	planet	they	found	was	in	a	Goldilocks	orbit	around	its	yellow	sun,	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">images	 sent	 back	 showed	 a	 world	 very	 similar	 to	 Earth.	 An	 early	 Earth	 before the	industrial	revolution.	In	other	words,	Earth—before	we	messed	it	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	 got	 the	 name	 Avalon	 from	 a	 mythical	 island	 paradise	 detailed	 in	 the legends	of	King	Arthur.	It	was	where	they	forged	his	sword	 <i class="calibre4">Excalibur</i>	and	where he	went	to	recover	after	the	battle	of	Camlann.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 boy	 laughed	 and	 told	 Al	 he	 had	 gotten	 all	 this	 from	 the	 brochure advertising	 the	 lottery.	 After	 reading	 their	 glorified	 description,	 he	 said	 he	 was hooked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Avalon	was	not	the	only	planet	reachable	within	a	thirty-year	journey.	Four</p>
<p class="calibre1">starships	 were	 built	 and	 sent	 to	 different	 promising	 planets.	 They	 were assembled	in	space	in	a	synchronous	orbit	around	Earth,	and	it	took	five	years	to build	each	ship.	As	soon	as	one	starship	was	finished	and	launched,	another	was begun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	lottery	was	set	up	for	a	place	on	a	vessel,	and	it	raked	in	trillions.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1">charged	 one-hundred	 U.S.	 dollars	 per	 ticket,	 and	 the	 money	 financed	 the building	of	the	ships.	The	rest	was	supposed	to	help	those	most	affected	by	rising sea	levels,	catastrophic	storms,	species	extinction	and	so	forth.	The	ships	turned out	 to	 be	 extravagantly	 expensive,	 of	 course,	 but	 the	 people	 attempting	 to	 save the	planet	still	got	almost	half,	which	was	a	lot	of	money.	Unfortunately,	it	did little	to	make	the	Earth	more	livable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our	ship,	the	Excalibur <i class="calibre4">, </i>	was	the	last	one	built	of	the	four.	It	benefited	from its	 predecessors	 in	 that	 it	 had	 the	 best	 of	 everything.	 There’s	 supposed	 to	 be	 a very	extensive	seed	bank	for	crop	promotion,	a	large	hydroponic	farm,	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">latest	design	of	primary	fusion	drive	that	money	could	buy.	The	hibernation	pods had	 all	 the	 bugs	 worked	 out	 and	 were	 the	 best	 models	 built	 to	 date.	 They	 also said	 the	 master	 control	 computer	 was	 one	 hundred	 times	 better	 than	 the computer	on	the	first	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our	 ship	 is	 like	 a	 modern	 day	 Titanic,	 with	 everything	 needed	 for	 a	 long voyage.	Except	the	Titanic	was	for	recreation,	and	the	 <i class="calibre4">Excalibur</i>	is	for	survival.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	 was	 the	 last	 one	 aboard	 the	 last	 ship,	 which	 means	 he	 was	 the	 last person	allowed	off	the	planet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 two	 shipmates	 entered	 the	 capsule	 for	 the	 number	 one	 spoke	 using Chris’s	card.	They	both	grabbed	hold	of	the	tree,	and	Al	activated	the	lift.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>watched	the	walls	of	the	spoke	slide	by,	and	as	they	got	closer	to	the	hub,	Chris began	to	smile.	When	the	lift	reached	the	top	of	the	tube	and	stopped,	he	looked at	Al	and	said,	“Is	there	anything	like	zero	gravity?	I	will	never	get	tired	of	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 soon	 as	 the	 door	 opened	 and	 the	 lights	 came	 on,	 Chris	 pushed	 off	 and sailed	 gracefully	 to	 the	 far	 wall,	 where	 he	 grabbed	 a	 waiting	 handle.	 Like	 a monkey,	he	then	swung	from	handle	to	handle	spinning	around	the	circular	hub</p>
<p class="calibre1">until	 he	 got	 back	 to	 Al,	 where	 he	 stopped,	 smiled,	 and	 said,	 “Ever	 flown before?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	be	honest,	I’m	not	sure...let’s	see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 pushed	 off	 to	 try	 and	 follow	 Chris’s	 example.	 As	 it	 turned	 out,	 it	 was trickier	than	it	looked.	The	lift	section	was	slowly	revolving,	and	they	had	to	be careful	not	to	bang	into	the	raised	capsule	as	it	rotated	around.	In	addition,	if	you landed	on	the	rotating	section	it	would	change	your	trajectory	and	make	you	go</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	 you	 didn’t	 want	 to.	 In	 the	 end,	 the	 two	 spacemen	 proved	 Al	 was reasonably	 proficient,	 and	 Chris,	 who	 had	 spent	 many	 hours	 practicing	 in	 the hub,	was	easily	deemed	an	expert. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a><img src="index-25_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Four</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	little	discussion,	they	decided	to	find	the	bridge	first.	Al	figured	if there	were	working	computers,	they	would	be	there,	and	they	could	gain</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	lot	of	useful	information.	There	may	also	be	a	labeled	schematic	of	the	ship	or a	 log	 book	 to	 tell	 them	 where	 they	 needed	 to	 go.	 Hopefully,	 there	 would	 be something	there	to	give	them	more	information. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	hatches	on	both	sides	of	the	hub	had	clear	markings.	Bold	lettering</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	one	door	said	MAIN	SHIP	and	the	other	said	BRIDGE.	Simple,	and	not	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">descriptive.	 There	 were	 the	 standard	 control	 panels,	 and	 both	 doors	 had	 green lights.	Things	were	looking	good	so	far. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	showed	Al	how	his	card	wouldn’t	work	on	the	bridge	door,	so	Al	tried</p>
<p class="calibre1">his—and	 nothing	 happened.	 A	 second	 attempt	 also	 failed.	 He	 looked	 closer	 at the	control	panel,	but	it	appeared	to	be	no	different	than	the	others.	Al	looked	at Chris	and	said,	“Ok,	that	didn’t	work,	how	about	we	try	the	other	door?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 door	 labeled	 Main	 Ship	 sighed,	 and	 then	 slid	 aside	 after	 Al	 pulled	 his card	through	the	reader.	Inside	the	door	was	a	smaller	version	of	the	habitat	ring airlocks.	 After	 the	 first	 door	 had	 closed	 behind	 them,	 they	 walked	 across	 and opened	the	secondary	door.	What	they	found	was	the	breadbasket	for	the	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	eyes	adjusted	to	the	brightly	lit	room,	and	before	them	stretched	a	long</p>
<p class="calibre1">wide	 aisle	 with	 planting	 beds	 on	 both	 sides	 going	 all	 the	 way	 to	 the	 other	 end, where	there	was	another	door.	Row	after	row	of	ten	by	twenty-foot	hydroponic</p>
<p class="calibre1">beds,	loaded	with	plants	and	separated	by	narrow	two-foot	walkways,	filled	both sides	 of	 the	 room.	 In	 the	 efficient	 beds	 was	 a	 bumper	 crop	 of	 all	 kinds	 of vegetables:	 corn,	 potatoes,	 squash,	 lettuce,	 melons,	 and	 further	 down	 what appeared	to	be	herbs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Industriously	 moving	 about	 them,	 a	 dozen	 three-foot	 tall	 robots	 tended	 the plants.	 Slender	 enough	 to	 fit	 through	 the	 walkways,	 they	 looked	 like	 sharp pointed	bullets	standing	on	end;	with	arms.	Long	spindly	appendages	that	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">reach	anywhere	in	a	plant	bed	and	were	raised	straight	up	when	navigating	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">walkways.	Chris	immediately	nicknamed	them,  <i class="calibre4">Pinheads</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 robots,	 busy	 harvesting	 their	 crops,	 ignored	 the	 two	 humans	 slowly walking	down	the	central	aisle.	The	room,	maybe	fifty	feet	tall	and	two	hundred feet	long,	was	a	cornucopia	of	produce. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>“This	 stuff	 has	 been	 growing	 for	 a	 while,	 what	 do	 you	 think	 activated	 it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	was	still	taking	it	all	in,	his	head	following	the	long	line	of	planting	beds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	to	Chris	and	said,	“I	would	think	the	growing	of	crops	wouldn’t	start until	just	before	we	arrived	at	Avalon.	Why	is	it	here	going	full	blast?	We	need to	find	out	where	this	ship	is,	and	exactly	how	much	time	has	passed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look—tomatoes!”	 Chris	 exclaimed.	 He	 ran	 the	 last	 couple	 steps	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">snatched	a	ripe	tomato	from	the	vine.	His	face	lit	up	when	he	took	a	bite,	and	he said,	 “Best	 tomato	 ever!	 I’ve	 been	 living	 on	 packaged	 food	 so	 long;	 I	 almost forgot	what	a	fresh	tomato	tastes	like.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Towards	 the	 center	 of	 the	 farm,	 on	 the	 right	 side,	 was	 a	 chute	 labeled <i class="calibre4">Incinerator</i>.	 Three	 pinheads	 were	 loading	 fruits,	 vegetables,	 and	 plant	 matter into	it;	causing	the	food	to	disappear	into	the	belly	of	the	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	asked	Al,	“Why	do	you	think	they	are	doing	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	one	here	to	eat	it	I	guess,”	replied	Al. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	moved	on.	When	the	two	searchers	reached	the	door	at	the	other	end	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	aisle,	they	found	it	labeled	with	a	more	stylistic	sign	declaring	it	to	be,  <i class="calibre4">THE</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">PARK</i>.	Neither	spoke,	however	both	were	thinking,  <i class="calibre4">This	sounded	promising</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	opened	the	door	into	a	large	space,	similar	in	size	to	the	farm,	only	here</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	a	perfect	replica	of	a	full	grown	Earth	park—at	night.	A	park	complete	with trees,	benches,	winding	paths,	and	grass.	Above	them,	simulated	stars	and	a	full moon	filtered	light	throughout	the	park,	and	there	was	a	gentle	breeze	circulating from	 somewhere	 that	 brought	 with	 it	 the	 evening	 scents	 of	 Earth	 in	 a	 well-designed	city	park. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	colonists	brought	with	them	a	piece	of	home.	A	place	to	come	and	think, </p>
<p class="calibre1">to	dream,	and	to	recharge	after	a	day	of	living	on	a	spaceship.	The	only	missing component	 were	 the	 people.	 Humans	 were	 all	 the	 park	 needed	 to	 make	 it complete.	 Almost	 at	 the	 same	 time,	 they	 stepped	 over	 to	 the	 closest	 bench	 and sat	down	to	marvel	at	their	discovery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	informed	Al	the	park	had	a	blurb	in	the	brochure.	“I	read	it	was	here, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 I	 had	 no	 idea	 it	 would	 be	 this	 nice.	 You	 see,	 the	 ship	 is	 designed	 using modules,	 and	 the	 modules	 are	 reconfigured	 to	 make	 up	 the	 different	 sections. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 park	 and	 the	 farm	 are	 parts	 of	 one	 module	 and	 originally	 designed	 for	 the first	ship.	Over	the	years,	they	improved	and	refined	the	tech	until	they	created this	state-of-the-art	module.	There	are	fruit	trees	here:	peach,	apple,	orange,	and even	pear	trees.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	asked,	“All	this	for	three	months?	Weren’t	they	supposed	to	go	down	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	planet	after	they	arrived?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>“They	were,	but	they	would	have	to	live	onboard	until	they	were	able	to	get down	to	the	planet	and	get	set	up.	The	ship	would	remain	in	orbit	to	assist	the colonists	 for	 years	 afterward	 with	 medical	 facilities,	 seed	 storage,	 and	 building materials.	All	the	supplies	could	remain	aboard	the	ship	until	needed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	about	shuttles?”	inquired	Al. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 think	 the	 brochure	 said	 five	 shuttles,	 capable	 of	 twenty-five	 passengers each.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	somewhere	on	this	ship	is	our	ticket	out	of	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	 grimaced,	 “Yeah,	 if	 we	 knew	 how	 to	 fly	 one,	 and	 we’re	 not	 a	 billion miles	from	nowhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	talked	for	a	while	longer	and	then	got	up	to	wander	the	park.	Strolling</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	 the	 moonlit	 path,	 they	 passed	 the	 fruit	 trees	 Chris	 mentioned	 and	 helped themselves	to	an	apple.	At	the	end	of	the	footpath,	they	entered	the	airlock	for the	 next	 module	 labeled	 MEDICAL	 BAY	 and	 HIBERNATION	 UNIT</p>
<p class="calibre1">STORAGE. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	we’re	getting	somewhere,”	remarked	Al. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	secondary	hatch	opened	onto	a	long	hallway,	both	sides	of	which	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	an	extensive	medical	bay.	The	lights	were	on	only	in	the	hall	and	the	rooms</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	both	sides	were	left	dark	and	foreboding.	There	were	foggy	plastic	panels	on both	sides	of	the	hall	that	helped	little	in	allowing	them	to	see	into	the	medical offices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doors	were	located	on	both	sides,	each	with	lettering	stating	their	use.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1">stepped	through	a	door	marked	 <i class="calibre4">Recovery, </i>	 and	 the	 lighting	 quickly	 increased	 to expose	 the	 interior.	 Six	 hospital	 beds	 were	 arranged	 around	 the	 room,	 with medical	equipment	surrounding	each	of	them;	waiting	for	their	first	patients. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wish	I	could	have	woke	up	here,”	Al	confided	to	Chris.	“When	I	woke	up, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	thought	I	was	having	a	nightmare.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me	too,”	Chris	replied.	“My	mom	is	here	somewhere;	I	hope	she	can	wake</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	in	one	of	these	beds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	mother	is	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	 the	 one	 that	 helped	 me	 get	 aboard.	 They	 claimed	 the	 lottery	 was totally	 unbiased,	 but	 it	 does	 help	 to	 know	 the	 right	 people,”	 Chris	 proudly informed	Al,	“She	is	the	senior	electrical	engineer	on	this	ship.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 put	 his	 hand	 on	 Chris’s	 shoulder,	 smiled	 and	 said,	 “Lucky	 you.	 Not everyone	 has	 a	 mother	 like	 that.	 I	 think	 the	 hibernation	 units	 are	 in	 the	 next room,	let’s	see	if	we	can	find	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Hibernation	Unit	Storage	(also	known	as	Hiber-Pod	Bay)	was	dark	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">quiet.	 Tiny	 lights	 outlined	 the	 walkways,	 with	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 room	 cloaked	 in shadow.	 Standing	 on	 end,	 tilted	 just	 a	 little,	 and	 resembling	 tombstones,	 was	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>room	full	of	hiber-pods.	Row	after	row	of	blinking	lights,	indicating	the	status	of each	pod,	reminded	Al	of	colored	fireflies	on	a	summer	night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 stepped	 up	 to	 the	 closest	 pod	 to	 get	 a	 better	 look.	 Instead	 of	 a	 name, there	 was	 only	 the	 number	 four.	 A	 small	 glowing	 window	 allowed	 them	 to	 see the	face	of	a	man,	maybe	thirty	years	old,	with	brown	hair,	and	the	slightest	of smiles.	A	foggy	mist	of	coolant	flowed	around	his	peaceful	sleeping	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	pod	indicator	lights	were	blinking	green,	which	was	a	good	indication	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	still	alive.	There	was	some	in	this	sleeping	crowd	that	were	not	so	lucky.	An occasional	 blinking	 red	 light	 meant	 some	 of	 these	 people	 were	 not	 okay,	 and might	never	see	the	end	of	their	trip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 moved	 to	 a	 pod	 with	 the	 blinking	 red	 lights.	 Determining	 if	 it	 was	 a man	or	a	woman	was	difficult.	Whoever	it	was,	they	died	a	long	time	ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	need	to	find	my	mother	before	it’s	too	late.”	Chris	was	worried	and	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	had	come	to	a	realization.	“There	are	no	names	and	a	lot	of	pods.	We	need</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	know	the	number	assigned	each	person	to	find	your	mother.	With	the	fog	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	windows,	it	might	be	hard	to	recognize	her.	Maybe,	if	we	can	find	a	working computer	terminal,	we	can	look	it	up,	or	it’s	possible	there	is	a	handwritten	list stored	somewhere	for	emergencies.	Let’s	look	around	and	see	what	we	can	find.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Small	 offices	 lined	 the	 outer	 walls	 of	 the	 hiber-pod	 bay,	 and	 they</p>
<p class="calibre1">systematically	 searched	 them.	 The	 lights	 came	 on	 when	 they	 entered	 these rooms,	and	the	search	progressed	quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	one	office	Al	found	a	safe	with	a	card	reader	and	a	key	slot.	He	tried	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">card,	 but	 nothing	 happened,	 so	 he	 continued	 his	 search.	 All	 the	 computer terminals	 were	 off-line	 or	 without	 power;	 it	 was	 impossible	 to	 tell	 which. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Working	 towards	 the	 end	 of	 the	 module,	 they	 searched	 all	 the	 offices	 and checked	all	the	cabinets	and	drawers	that	were	not	locked.	They	found	nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">useful	and	met	at	the	door	at	the	far	end	of	the	bay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	is	when	Al	remembered	the	keys	he	found	in	Al	Clark’s	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	got	keys!”	he	exclaimed.	Al	reached	into	his	pocket,	grabbed	the	keys, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	held	them	up	for	Chris	to	see	with	a	big	smile	on	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah...so?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Follow	 me,”	 Al	 said.	 He	 turned	 around	 and	 headed	 back	 to	 the	 office	 that held	the	safe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	fell	a	little	behind	as	Al	rushed	back,	so	he	entered	the	room	to	find	Al trying	one	of	the	keys	and	sliding	his	card.	He	kept	trying	different	keys	until	on his	third	attempt	the	safe	popped	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	found	these	keys	in	the	cabinet	with	my	gun	and	my	card.”	Al	pulled	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">door	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>“I’ve	never	seen	keys	like	that,”	Chris	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	might	be	because	they	are	from	way	before	your	time.	It	makes	sense</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	would	use	these	old	keys	to	add	a	second	layer	of	security	to	the	access	of highly	secure	areas.	They	are	almost	impossible	to	find	and	hard	to	reproduce.	If these	are	Al	Clark’s	keys,	he	had	a	high-security	clearance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	contents	of	the	small	safe	was	a	single	thin	journal.	On	the	cover,	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">faded	lettering,	were	the	words:	Hibernation	Unit	Code	List.	The	journal	was	old and	dry,	and	they	had	to	handle	it	with	care.	Still,	the	little	book	was	precisely what	they	needed. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
THE	JOURNAL	WAS	A	BACK-up	for	a	back-up.	A	code	book	that	referenced<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">names	to	numbers	and	was	the	last	line	of	defense	in	case	the	records	were	lost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	abbreviated	and	crude,	but	it	told	them	what	they	needed	to	know.	On	the left	 side	 was	 a	 line	 of	 numbers	 starting	 with	 one	 and	 increasing	 on	 down	 the page.	To	the	right	of	the	numbers	was	a	row	of	names	with	the	top	name	being</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tobias	 Effinger.	 Following	 the	 line	 to	 the	 right	 side	 of	 the	 page	 led	 to	 a description;	Captain,	Commanding	Officer,	EC-Excaliber. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris’s	mother	was	number	twenty-six.	Her	name	was	Elizabeth	Morris,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 was	 in	 pod	 number	 twenty-six	 with	 her	 position	 listed	 as	 Chief	 Electrical Engineer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	 was	 delighted,	 and	 wanted	 to	 go	 wake	 her	 right	 away.	 However,	 Al cautioned,	“I	don’t	think	it’s	that	simple.	Do	you	know	how	to	operate	a	hiber-pod?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	hard	can	it	be?”	Chris	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	was	not	so	certain.	In	spite	of	his	doubts	he	said,	“All	right,	let’s	go	and see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	returned	to	the	hiber-pod	bay,	and	it	didn’t	take	long	for	Chris	to	locate his	 mother’s	 pod.	 She	 was	 one	 of	 the	 lucky	 ones.	 The	 indicator	 lights	 on	 the outside	 of	 the	 pod	 were	 all	 flashing	 green.	 Elizabeth	 was	 a	 very	 attractive woman,	and	Al	thought	her	face	looked	serene	and	beautiful.	The	fog	in	the	pod</p>
<p class="calibre1">obscured	the	details,	but	he	could	tell	she	had	the	same	blonde	hair	as	her	son—</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	longer.	The	resemblance	to	Chris	was	startling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under	the	flashing	lights	on	the	control	panel,	was	a	small	cover	that	popped</p>
<p class="calibre1">open	 when	 pushed	 on,	 and	 inside	 were	 gauges,	 buttons,	 dials	 and	 more	 lights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	troubling	tiny	light	glowed	a	steady	crimson.	Operation	of	the	pod	appeared complicated,	and	there	was	no	button	or	knob	labeled	WAKE	UP.	If	the	process</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>was	done	improperly,	it	could	kill	the	person	inside.	They	looked	at	each	other and	said	almost	simultaneously,	“We	need	a	manual.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 left	 Chris’s	 mother	 to	 her	 dreams	 and	 headed	 back	 to	 their	 quarters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Along	 the	 way,	 they	 each	 grabbed	 another	 piece	 of	 fruit	 from	 the	 trees	 in	 the park;	 Al	 tried	 an	 orange,	 and	 Chris	 another	 apple.	 They	 ate	 them	 without speaking,	each	thinking	thoughts	of	their	own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 their	 quarters,	 Chris	 ate	 a	 package	 from	 the	 mess	 hall.	 Al	 decided	 he wasn’t	hungry.	They	each	opened	a	bottle	of	water	and	sat	down	at	the	table	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">plan	their	next	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	was	disappointed.	“Surely	they	have	manuals	somewhere	for	the	hiber-</p>
<p class="calibre1">pods.	I	can’t	believe	we	didn’t	find	any.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 hopes	 had	 gone	 sky	 high	 when	 they	 found	 the	 journal.	 When	 they</p>
<p class="calibre1">realized	they	didn’t	know	how	to	operate	the	units,	his	hopes	fell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	take	it	you	and	your	mother	are	close?”	asked	Al. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	 sighed	 and	 answered,	 “Yeah,	 she’s	 great.	 She	 and	 my	 dad	 are	 both great.	I	was	fortunate	to	have	them	for	parents.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	look	on	his	face	turned	sad	as	he	told	Al	of	his	mother	and	father,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	decisions	they	had	to	make	regarding	the	trip	to	Avalon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	 was	 the	 only	 child	 of	 Elizabeth	 and	 Thomas	 Morris.	 Both	 successful professionals	 with	 the	 income	 that	 accompanies	 it.	 He	 had	 gone	 to	 the	 best	 of schools	 and	 graduated	 as	 valedictorian	 of	 his	 senior	 class	 in	 high	 school.	 He graduated	third	in	his	class	at	college.	Afterwards,	he	started	an	apprenticeship	in advanced	ship	propulsion	and	was	ready	to	start	his	second	year	when	he	got	the call	for	the	trip	to	Avalon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	mother	and	father	surprised	him	with	a	party	the	night	before	they	left.	A</p>
<p class="calibre1">party	 they	 would	 never	 forget;	 a	 bittersweet	 celebration	 that	 would	 be	 the	 last occasion	they	celebrated	together.	Chris’s	father	was	happy	for	his	wife	and	son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately,	he	did	not	make	the	lottery	and	had	to	be	left	behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	father	talked	to	him	that	night,	“Sometimes	things	don’t	go	the	way	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	prefer.	I	can’t	go—but	you	and	your	mother	must.	I	will	be	happy	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge	that	the	two	of	you	will	have	a	better	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	called	Chris	to	the	ship	the	next	day,	the	day	before	it	left.	He	arrived</p>
<p class="calibre1">early	in	the	morning,	ushered	aboard,	and	taken	directly	to	the	room	where	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">hibernation	 pod	 was.	 The	 man	 that	 helped	 him	 into	 the	 pod	 said	 this	 spot	 was supposed	 to	 be	 filled	 by	 an	 experienced	 propulsion	 engineer,	 and	 that	 he	 was one,	of	only	two,	with	hiber	units	located	outside	the	hiber-pod	bay.	He	was	very fortunate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 their	 rush	 to	 get	 underway,	 he	 had	 missed	 orientation,	 and	 the	 walk-through	that	the	other	passengers	received;	despite	the	late	notice,	he	had	made</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>it.	He	was	going	to	Avalon,	and	his	mother	was	going	with	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	mom	will	know	a	lot	more	about	the	ship...when	we	wake	her.”	Chris</p>
<p class="calibre1">told	 Al	 between	 yawns.	 “Where	 do	 you	 think	 we	 should	 look	 first	 for	 a manual?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al’s	answer	was	thoughtful,	“It	just	makes	sense	to	me	they	would	store	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">manuals	somewhere	in	the	medical	or	hiber-pod	bays.	We	probably	need	to	try</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	keys	I	have,	and	see	if	there	are	cabinets	or	drawers	that	we	missed	that	can be	unlocked.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	had	a	plan,	so	with	renewed	hope	they	retired	to	their	separate	rooms	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">try	and	get	some	sleep.	Visions	of	what	might	be	made	them	restless,	and	kept</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	from	a	good	night’s	sleep. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Five</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	no	clocks	visible	anywhere.	Al	assumed	the	computer	terminals</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	the	means	for	telling	time	when	they	were	functional.	Time	would	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	 they	 made	 it.	 To	 them,	 it	 felt	 like	 early	 morning	 when	 they	 awoke	 and headed	to	the	medical	bay	to	start	their	search.	There	was	no	time	for	a	shower or	breakfast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	only	had	four	keys,	so	it	didn’t	take	long	for	them	to	try	the	keys	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">locked	storage	spaces.	They	searched	all	the	offices,	all	the	cabinets,	and	all	the drawers	of	the	medical	bay.	Where	the	keys	worked,	they	found	medical	books, </p>
<p class="calibre1">hypodermic	 injectors,	 some	 complicated	 looking	 meters,	 and	 other	 sensitive medical	equipment.	The	rest	required	keys	they	did	not	have,	so	they	moved	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	hiber-pod	bay	and	began	searching	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	what	seemed	like	hours,	they	found	what	they	sought.	In	a	back	office</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 a	 tall	 cabinet	 where	 the	 last	 key	 Al	 tried	 allowed	 them	 to	 open	 the	 doors. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Isn’t	 it	 always	 the	 last	 one? </i> Inside	 was	 a	 stack	 of	 thick	 Hibernation	 Unit Operation	 Manuals.	 These	 too	 were	 old	 and	 fragile	 and	 required	 careful treatment.	 However,	 inside	 the	 manuals	 were	 the	 procedures	 they	 needed	 to wake	Chris’s	mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	picked	one	up	and	grew	increasingly	discouraged	as	he	flipped	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	pages.	“This	may	take	a	little	longer	than	I	thought.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	heard	the	disappointment	in	his	voice	and	offered,	“We	can	do	this	Chris</p>
<p class="calibre1">—but	it’s	not	going	to	come	easy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	would	they	build	a	machine	that	is	so	complicated?”	Chris	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These	machines	have	to	maintain	a	person,	in	all	aspects,	for	many	years	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	little	power.	It's	a	miracle	they	could	build	them	at	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	I	guess	you’re	right,”	Chris	admitted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	said	he	was	hungry,	so	they	each	grabbed	a	manual	and	made	their	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 mess	 hall	 to	 get	 some	 lunch	 and	 digest	 the	 information	 contained	 in	 the books. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
THE	 MANUALS	 WERE	 VERY	 extensive	 and	 detailed.	 After	 they	 finished<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">eating	 a	 quick	 lunch,	 they	 went	 back	 to	 their	 quarters	 to	 dig	 in	 and	 continue</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>processing	the	information	contained	in	the	manuals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	 said,	 “I	 miss	 my	 comp	 pad	 a	 lot.	 If	 I	 had	 my	 pad,	 we	 could	 listen	 to music.	Music	helps	me	when	I	study.”	He	smiled	and	added,	“We	could	probably</p>
<p class="calibre1">even	get	a	step-by-step	procedure	on	how	to	wake	someone	from	a	hibernation</p>
<p class="calibre1">pod	off	the	net.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although	Al	had	no	memory	of	his	past,	he	knew	of	the	portable	electronic</p>
<p class="calibre1">devices	used	for	so	many	things.	“When	we	wake	your	mother,	I	think	she	might</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 able	 to	 restore	 the	 computers.	 I’m	 sure	 they	 have	 a	 music	 database	 of	 some kind	 on	 a	 colony	 ship,	 and	 I	 wouldn’t	 be	 surprised	 at	 all	 if	 they	 had	 some personal	data	pads	stashed	around	here	somewhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 would	 be	 great,”	 admitted	 Chris,	 “For	 now,	 I’ll	 just	 have	 to	 learn without	music.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	 reading	 through	 the	 different	 sections	 of	 the	 manual,	 Al	 was	 struck with	a	feeling	of	déjà	vu.	He	had	heard	or	read	this	material	before.	Sometime	in his	life,	he	had	been	familiar	with	this	book	or	one	very	much	like	it.	The	more he	read,	the	stronger	the	feeling	became,	and	in	time,	he	became	sure	he	knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">how	to	revive	someone	from	hibernation.	What	he	didn’t	know,	was	the	meaning</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	steady	red	light	on	Elizabeth’s	inner	control	panel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 books	 they	 found	 were	 basic	 operational	 manuals;	 written	 so	 that	 any ship	member	could	 follow	the	procedures	 when	all	indicator	 lights	were	green. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	manual	stressed	the	all-green	conditions,	and	emergency	procedures	had	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 included.	 There	 was	 nothing	 about	 what	 to	 do	 if	 something	 went	 wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 subject	 could	 encounter	 falling	 blood	 pressure,	 increased	 heart	 rate,	 brain damage,	 breathing	 problems,	 and	 so	 on.	 Any	 of	 these	 could	 cripple	 or	 kill	 the occupant.	 There	 was	 no	 information	 on	 the	 tiny	 red	 light	 in	 the	 manuals	 they had,	and	it	concerned	Al. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 think	 we	 might	 need	 a	 technician,”	 suggested	 Al.	 “Your	 mom’s	 pod	 has that	red	light,	and	I	don’t	know	what	it	means.	Did	you	find	any	mention	of	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	and	I’ve	looked	everywhere,”	Chris	admitted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	 look	 in	 the	 code	 book,”	 Al	 suggested.	 “Let’s	 see	 if	 we	 can	 find	 a hiber-pod	 technician	 that	 has	 all	 green	 lights	 on	 the	 pod	 controls.	 I	 think	 I	 can wake	the	technician	if	the	lights	are	all	green,	and	then	the	technician	can	wake your	mother.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	 liked	 Al’s	 idea	 and	 immediately	 stood	 to	 get	 the	 code	 book.	 He	 was gone	 only	 a	 minute	 and	 came	 back	 with	 a	 pen,	 a	 fresh	 pad	 of	 paper,	 and	 the precious	book. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	held	up	the	pen	and	pad	and	with	a	wink	said,	“Old	tech.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	laughed	and	shook	his	head,	“I	do	remember	those.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>Before	long,	Chris	had	a	list	of	twelve	names	with	the	higher	ranks	arranged at	the	top. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 is	 all	 there	 is.	 I	 only	 added	 the	 ones	 that	 said	 they	 were	 hibernation specialists.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	 handed	 the	 list	 to	 Al,	 who	 took	 a	 quick	 look	 and	 said,	 “This	 will	 do nicely.	Are	you	ready	to	go	back?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	wait.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	did	not	run,	but	it	wasn’t	far	from	it.	When	the	two	castaways	arrived	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 airlock	 leading	 to	 the	 spoke	 lift,	 and	 were	 opening	 the	 hatch,	 Al	 heard	 a distant	 whine	 coming	 their	 way—and	 getting	 louder	 fast.	 He	 asked,	 “Do	 you hear	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	looked	at	Al	with	surprise	and	listened.	“Hear	what?”	Oh,...that?	What</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	approaching	whine	became	a	scream,	and	grew	increasingly	louder	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	corridor	amplifying	the	sound;	propelling	it	down	the	passageway	until.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	robot—look	out!”	Chris	cried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	indeed	a	robot.	A	small,	three-foot	tall	mechanoid,	rolling	on	a	single</p>
<p class="calibre1">ball	 and	 coming	 full	 blast	 towards	 them.	 It	 seemed	 intent	 on	 going	 as	 fast	 as possible	in	a	forward	direction—in	their	direction.	Right	down	the	middle	of	the corridor.	Both	impending	victims	wasted	no	time	moving	from	the	center	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">passageway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 realized	 that	 if	 the	 robot	 hit	 the	 door,	 as	 fast	 as	 it	 was	 going,	 it	 could damage	the	door	and	possibly	make	it	unusable.	They	might	lose	the	use	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	reliable	lift	to	the	rest	of	the	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quick,	jump	over	here	Chris!”	Al	yelled.	Chris	leaped	to	join	Al,	and	just	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 robot	 went	 past	 them,	 Al	 braced	 his	 back	 against	 the	 wall	 and	 kicked.	 The little	mechanical	assassin	ricocheted	off	the	wall	next	to	the	door,	leaving	a	deep dent,	and	then	the	wall	across	from	them	to	go	struggling	back	the	way	it	came. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	could	hear	the	screech	of	motors	as	it	attempted	to	return	to	its	suicidal	run. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Luckily,	it	only	traveled	ten	feet	or	so	before	it	started	wobbling	like	a	drunken sailor,	made	a	few	slow,	erratic	circles,	and	fell	to	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	 stood	 there	 stunned.	 When	 he	 could	 finally	 speak,	 he	 asked,	 “What was	that	all	about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	no	idea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	did	you	do	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	was	dismissive.	“What...Oh,	I	don’t	know.	It	just	kind	of	happened.	I	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">afraid	it	might	damage	the	door.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Holy	mackerel!	I	have	never	seen	reflexes	so	fast.	You	sure	put	the	hurt	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">it.	I	might	have	to	start	calling	you,	‘Al,	the	robot	killer.’	Ha—you	are	the	robot</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>killer	that	killed	a	killer	robot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	didn’t	find	it	quite	as	funny	as	Chris	apparently	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 walked	 over	 to	 take	 a	 closer	 look	 at	 this	 crazy	 little	 machine.	 After	 a short	inspection,	they	agreed	the	broken	robot	was	likely	to	be	one	of	the	ship’s service	units. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	probably	designed	to	clean	and	maintain	the	ring,”	suggested	Al. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	 half	 as	 wide	 as	 it	 was	 tall,	 it	 was	 cylindrical	 and	 moved	 about	 on	 a basketball	 sized	 sphere	 with	 a	 rough	 surface	 that	 protruded	 from	 the	 bottom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three	 spindly,	 extendable	 arms,	 equipped	 with	 various	 tools	 and	 pincers,	 lay crumpled	against	its	body.	Its	pale	blue	paint	was	scratched	up	and	splotchy.	On its	torso	was	a	faded	red	number	nine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 poor	 thing	 was	 not	 ‘dead.’	 It	 was,	 however,	 banged	 up	 pretty	 good.	 Al became	aware	of	a	muffled	whisper	coming	from	a	speaker	simulating	a	mouth, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	knelt	down	to	hear...  <i class="calibre4">Sorry</i>,	being	repeated	over	and	over.	He	asked	Chris	to bend	 down	 and	 listen,	 so	 he	 could	 join	 Al	 in	 wondering	 why	 this	 robot	 would attack	them,	and	then	be	sorry	for	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	left	the	broken	robot,	picked	up	the	manual	and	their	list	they	dropped</p>
<p class="calibre1">during	the	rampage,	and	rode	the	lift	up	to	the	hub.	From	there,	they	made	their way	to	the	hiber-pod	bay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 robot	 episode	 they	 left	 behind,	 to	 be	 replaced	 by	 the	 problem	 at	 hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	to	wake	someone	safely	from	a	long	hibernation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 a	 thorough	 search,	 there	 was	 only	 one	 hiber-pod	 technician	 with	 all green	lights	from	the	list	of	twelve.	Only	one	lacked	the	troubling	red	light	under the	 door	 to	 the	 control	 panel.	 The	 lucky	 person’s	 name	 was	 Anastasia Kossalowski. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s	young,”	Al	said	to	Chris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	she’s	cute,”	Chris	said	with	a	grin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	but	can	she	help	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	list	says	she	is	a	hiber-pod	technician.	She’s	the	only	one	with	all	green lights	and	our	only	real	chance.	We	have	to	wake	her	up,”	Chris	pointed	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	reluctantly	agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 standard	 restoration	 procedure	 was	 not	 all	 that	 difficult	 if	 you	 knew	 a few	 things.	 Once	 activated,	 most	 of	 the	 revival	 process	 is	 automatically performed	by	the	pod.	A	person	just	had	to	know	which	buttons	to	press,	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	push	those	buttons,	and	how	to	set	the	timer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	worked	together,	Al	pushed	the	buttons	and	Chris	double-checked	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	manual.	When	it	came	to	setting	the	timer,	they	discussed	it	and	decided to	use	the	recommended	six	hour	time	table	for	maximum	safety.	If	they	adjusted</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>the	 timer	 for	 less,	 it	 naturally	 raised	 the	 risk	 of	 something	 going	 wrong.	 They weren’t	in	that	big	a	hurry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Al	pressed	the	last	switch,	a	digital	timer	appeared,	and	steadily	began</p>
<p class="calibre1">counting	down	from	six	hours.	The	glow	brightened	inside	the	pod,	making	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">girl’s	 face	 look	 all	 the	 more	 angelic	 as	 the	 light	 flooded	 her	 features,	 and reflected	off	the	backs	of	the	pods	before	her.	Deep	inside	the	unit,	a	soft,	steady, ticking	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 decided	 to	 leave	 her	 for	 an	 hour.	 The	 risk	 was	 very	 low	 in	 the beginning,	 so	 they	 ran	 back	 to	 their	 quarters,	 cleaned	 up,	 grabbed	 a	 little something	to	eat	and	drink,	and	ran	back.	When	they	passed	the	place	where	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">robot	attacked	them,	they	noticed	the	strange	mechanical	creature	was	missing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 no	 sign	 of	 it	 having	 been	 there—except	 the	 dent	 beside	 the	 door.	 Chris grabbed	a	blanket	and	a	bottle	of	water	for	the	girl	in	the	pod,	and	Al	grabbed some	clothes	for	her,	water	for	them,	and	some	food	packs.	They	went	back	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	comfortable	and	wait	for	her	to	wake	up	from	her	long	slumber. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	 they	 waited,	 they	 talked.	 Chris	 was	 nervous	 and	 did	 most	 of	 the talking,	while	Al	mostly	listened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	old	do	you	think	she	is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About	your	age?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	she	looks	about	eighteen—maybe	nineteen.	Does	she	look	old	enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	be	a	technician?	What	if	she	can’t	wake	my	mother?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	have	to	wait	and	see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	will	like	my	mom—everybody	does.	She’s	a	great	engineer	that	loves</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 work.	 My	 dad	 cried	 when	 we	 left.	 It	 was	 the	 first	 time	 I’d	 ever	 seen	 that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	hesitated,	his	face	sad,	and	added,	“I’m	gonna	miss	him.	Should	we	check</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	pod	again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you	want,	I	just	checked	it,	though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Any	idea	why	that	crazy	robot	acted	like	that?	It	could	have	killed	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	was	crazy—wasn’t	it,”	Al	admitted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	continued	to	rattle	on,	“Where	do	you	think	we	are?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 chuckled,	 “We	 could	 be	 anywhere.	 We	 know	 we’re	 in	 a	 ship,	 that’s	 a beginning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	humor	went	right	over	his	head,	and	Chris	continued,	“I	haven’t	seen	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">observation	area	yet,	have	you?	Maybe	there’s	one	past	the	bridge	door.	If	I	had designed	this	ship,	I	would	put	the	windows	in	front	of	the	ring,	so	you’d	have an	unobstructed	view	of	what’s	in	front	of	you.	Do	you	think	your	keys	will	help open	the	bridge	door?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	didn’t	see	a	place	for	a	key,	but	I	didn’t	look	all	that	closely,”	Al	replied while	thinking,  <i class="calibre4">this	is	going	to	be	a	long	five	hours. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>Thirty	 minutes	 before	 the	 timer	 reached	 zero,	 there	 was	 the	 sound	 of	 a whining	motor,	and	the	front	of	the	pod	slid	down	into	the	floor.	The	mist	inside disappeared,	and	they	got	their	first	good	look	at	Anastasia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	dressed	in	a	tight-fitting	silver	suit	and	was	so	short	and	petite	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">reminded	Al	of	a	china	doll—a	fragile	doll	at	that.	Her	hair	was	short	and	brown, parted	in	the	middle,	and	her	appearance	made	her	look	as	if	she	fell	asleep	only hours	ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	timer	reduced	itself	to	thirty	seconds,	and	she	groaned.	Her	eyes	popped</p>
<p class="calibre1">open,	and	she	looked	around	wildly	for	a	moment	before	asking,	“Where	the	hell</p>
<p class="calibre1">am	I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	timer	clicked	to	zero,	and	an	alarm	sounded. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
SHE	TRIED	TO	TAKE	A	step	out	of	the	hiber-pod	and	began	to	fall.	Chris	was<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">there	to	catch	her	and	laid	her	down	on	the	blanket	they	spread	out	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	few	minutes,	the	confused	young	woman	recovered	enough	for	them	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">talk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 is	 not	 at	 all	 what	 they	 told	 me.	 I	 was	 supposed	 to	 wake	 up	 on	 a	 soft fluffy	bed,	with	friendly	people	all	around	me	in	white	coats	and	name	tags	that said,  <i class="calibre4">Hibernation	 Specialist. </i> Where	 are	 your	 name	 tags?	 Where	 are	 the	 white coats?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	was	quick	to	explain,	“Anastasia,	we	don’t	have	any	white	coats	or	name</p>
<p class="calibre1">tags	for	that	matter.	For	some	reason,	we	are	the	only	people	awake	on	this	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	 has	 gone	 terribly	 wrong,	 and	 we	 woke	 you	 because	 we	 need	 your help.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 shook	 her	 head,	 paused	 for	 a	 second,	 and	 said,	 “Nobody	 calls	 me Anastasia.	 That	 name	 is	 way	 too	 formal	 and	 takes	 too	 long	 to	 say.	 Everybody calls	me	Ana.	What	is	it	you	need	 <i class="calibre4">me</i>	to	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 and	 Chris	 took	 turns	 filling	 her	 in	 on	 what	 they	 knew.	 She	 asked	 an occasional	 question,	 but	 for	 the	 most	 part,	 she	 just	 listened.	 Al	 told	 her	 of	 his experience	 when	 he	 woke	 up	 and	 his	 subsequent	 amnesia.	 Chris	 followed	 with his	awakening,	and	the	year	he	spent	alone	exploring	the	ring.	They	told	her	how they	 met,	 their	 discoveries	 since	 then,	 and	 explained	 their	 trepidations	 about waking	 his	 mother.	 They	 concluded	 with	 their	 run-in	 with	 the	 kamikaze	 robot and	then	what	it	took	to	wake	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ana	grinned	and	said,	“I	want	my	money	back.	This	is	not	what	I	signed	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">for.”	Al	and	Chris	laughed,	and	it	felt	good.	The	new	group	of	three	was	going	to get	along	just	fine. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>Chris	asked	the	question	uppermost	on	his	mind,	“Just	how	old	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ana	 hesitated,	 and	 it	 looked	 like	 she	 might	 not	 answer,	 until	 she	 did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	 about	 the	 question	 made	 her	 indignant.	 “I	 just	 turned	 twenty-one before	we	left.	Why?	Does	that	matter?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No...no,	it	doesn’t	matter,	I	was	just	curious.	You	sure	don’t	look	that	old,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">stuttered	Chris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	responded,	“I’m	a	lot	older	than	I	look.	It’s	been	a	problem	most	of	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ana	went	on	to	explain	she	was	a	child	prodigy.	She	graduated	high	school</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 fourteen,	 college	 at	 sixteen,	 and	 was	 now	 a	 certified	 hiber-pod	 technician. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because	 of	 all	 she	 had	 accomplished,	 she	 was	 always	 touchy	 about	 her	 age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	learned	Ana	was	a	china	doll	with	brains	and	an	attitude. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still	unsteady	after	her	revival,	they	helped	her	over	to	Chris’	mother’s	pod, </p>
<p class="calibre1">where	 she	 inspected	 the	 control	 panel	 and	 gave	 them	 the	 meaning	 of	 the worrisome	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 an	 indicator	 light	 warning	 us	 she	 has	 been	 asleep	 more	 than	 the recommended	 lifespan	 of	 the	 unit.	 It’s	 a	 good	 thing	 you	 didn’t	 try	 to	 wake	 her the	 standard	 way,	 there	 are	 specific	 treatments	 needed,	 and	 she	 might	 not	 have made	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ana	needed	food	and	rest,	so	they	decided	to	take	her	to	the	habitat	ring.	One</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	day	would	make	little	difference	to	Chris’s	mother,	and	they	wanted	Ana	at her	 best	 when	 she	 started	 the	 awakening	 procedure.	 One	 on	 each	 side,	 they helped	her	to	the	living	quarters	of	the	wheel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 the	 way	 back,	 they	 scrounged	 clothes	 that	 were	 closer	 to	 her	 size,	 and when	 they	 strolled	 through	 the	 park,	 they	 picked	 some	 fruit	 from	 the overburdened	trees	to	take	back	with	them.	Her	favorite	was	the	apples. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	and	Al	set	her	up	in	the	quarters	next	to	theirs,	where	she	could	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	privacy	and	still	be	close.	The	two	men	returned	to	their	quarters	and	left her	alone	to	get	a	shower,	eat,	and	rest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three	hours	later,	she	was	outside	their	quarters	and	knocking	on	their	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 tired	 of	 sleeping.	 I	 think	 I’ve	 had	 enough	 sleep	 to	 last	 the	 rest	 of	 my life...so	isn’t	there	something	we	should	be	doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	invited	her	into	the	room	and	offered	her	a	seat	at	the	little	table.	Ana</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	she	had	showered,	changed	into	her	clean	coveralls,	laid	on	the	bed	for	two hours,	and	decided	she	couldn’t	sit	still	any	longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 informed	 them,	 “We	 need	 to	 get	 some	 things	 together	 before	 we	 can revive	 your	 mother.	 She’s	 going	 to	 have	 to	 be	 moved	 to	 the	 medical	 center before	 she	 wakes	 up,	 so	 we’re	 going	 to	 need	 a	 floating	 stretcher.	 Most	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>stuff	 we’ll	 need	 will	 be	 in	 the	 medical	 center.	 We’ll	 also	 need	 to	 prepare	 the recovery	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	nodded	and	said,	“I’m	ready	if	you	are.	How	about	you,	Chris?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	been	dreaming	about	this	for	a	very	long	time.	You	better	believe	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">am	ready.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	grab	what	we	might	need	and	take	it	with	us,”	suggested	Al,	“It	may</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	a	while	before	we	get	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 didn’t	 have	 a	 lot	 to	 pack,	 so	 it	 wasn’t	 long	 before	 they	 were	 on	 their way	to	the	hiber-pod	bay.	Ana	liked	 <i class="calibre4">flying</i>	almost	as	much	as	Chris,	and	she	was pretty	good.	However,	they	had	little	time	to	play	and	moved	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lights	came	on	as	soon	as	they	entered	the	recovery	room	in	the	medical</p>
<p class="calibre1">center. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	looked	around	and	told	Ana,	“We’ve	been	all	over	this	place.	There	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	much	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled	and	tapped	her	foot	on	the	floor,	“Most	of	the	good	stuff	is	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ana’s	 revelation	 proved	 correct.	 There	 were	 small	 recessed	 handles	 in	 the floor	 that	 opened	 panels,	 and	 underneath	 was	 the	 real	 inventory	 of	 the	 medical center.	 The	 storage	 space	 below	 was	 more	 than	 adequate,	 with	 room	 for everything	a	modern	medical	facility	needed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	 did	 that	 because	 it	 was	 the	 safest	 place	 to	 store	 things	 for	 the	 long journey.	Once	we	got	to	Avalon,	we	could	unpack	it	all	and	be	ready	for	patients in	about	a	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	admitted,	“Actually,	it’s	kind	of	smart	storing	everything	underneath.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">sure	never	thought	of	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	 are	 all	 kinds	 of	 things	 under	 these	 floors.	 Space	 inside	 a	 starship	 is not	 wasted,	 and	 there	 is	 a	 lot	 of	 space.	 When	 you	 walk	 into	 any	 of	 these modules,	 you	 only	 see	 about	 two-thirds	 of	 what’s	 there—you	 didn’t	 get	 the tour?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	 glanced	 at	 Al,	 grimaced,	 and	 replied,	 “No,	 we	 missed	 that.	 It	 sounds like	it	might	have	been	fun.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	very	helpful,”	Al	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	that	too.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Six</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	ready	to	wake	Elizabeth,	with	everything	laid	out	on	tables	by	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bed	 in	 the	 recovery	 room.	 Everything	 Ana	 might	 need	 was	 within	 arm’s reach.	This	attempt	would	be	the	first	time	she	had	to	perform	this	procedure.	No person	on	Earth	had	slept	this	long,	and,	therefore,	there	was	no	precedence	for waking	someone	after	the	recommended	length	of	service	of	a	hibernation	pod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	would	have	to	count	on	her	skill	and	training	to	pull	this	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	programmed	the	pod	for	this	unusual	type	of	revival	and	set	the	timer	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">eight	hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	mother	has	been	asleep	for	a	long	time,	and	she	is	not	young.	It’s	going</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	take	a	little	longer	to	do	this	safely,”	she	warned	her	anxious	companions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	stepped	back	and	got	comfortable;	settling	in	for	the	long	wait.	The	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">men	were	asleep	within	an	hour,	but	Ana	stayed	awake	and	monitored	the	hiber-</p>
<p class="calibre1">pod.	She	wasn’t	able	to	sleep	anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 the	 front	 of	 the	 pod	 slid	 down,	 thirty	 minutes	 before	 the	 timer	 went off,	Ana	told	the	suddenly	awake	men	to	put	Elizabeth	on	the	floating	stretcher. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	floated	her	to	the	medical	center,	where	they	transferred	her	to	the	bed	they had	prepared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elizabeth	looked	drawn	and	gray	as	she	lay	before	them.	Ana	hooked	her	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 machines	 that	 would	 monitor	 her	 vitals	 and	 quickly	 administered	 two injections.	The	bed	was	equipped	with	an	internal	I.V.	unit,	which	she	hooked	up and	 then	 opened	 the	 valves	 to	 allow	 the	 fluids	 she	 had	 prepared	 to	 enter	 her veins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	we	wait,”	Ana	said;	peering	at	Chris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	got	all	my	fingers	crossed—that’s	not	bad	luck...is	it?”	he	asked	while</p>
<p class="calibre1">grinning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ana	replied,	“Don’t	be	ridiculous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	laughed,	and	Chris	tried	to	act	embarrassed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elizabeth’s	color	slowly	improved.	She	started	breathing	more	regularly	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">soon	 after,	 her	 eyes	 began	 to	 blink.	 After	 an	 hour	 in	 recovery,	 her	 eyes	 finally opened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	around,	noticed	Chris,	and	with	a	voice	he	could	barely	hear	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">whispered,	“Christopher,	what	are	you	doing	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>“I’m	 here	 to	 welcome	 my	 mother	 to	 the	 waking	 world,”	 Chris	 declared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aren’t	you	glad	to	see	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um...of	course	I	am	Christopher.	You	kept	showing	up	in	my	dreams.	Now, </p>
<p class="calibre1">what	is	happening?	You’re	not	the	people	who	were	to	wake	me.	Is	everything</p>
<p class="calibre1">ok?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ana	 admonished,	 “You	 need	 to	 rest	 for	 a	 little	 while	 before	 you	 talk	 too much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	 she	 was	 waking	 up,	 they	 slowly	 told	 her	 their	 stories,	 and	 without ceremony	 or	 fanfare,	 she	 became	 the	 fourth	 member	 of	 their	 party—a	 small group	of	two	young	people,	and	two	not	so	young. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 asked	 if	 she	 recognized	 him,	 and	 her	 thoughtful	 reply	 was,	 “I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">sorry...Mister	Clark,	but	I	don’t	recall	ever	meeting	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	preferred	to	be	called	Liz,	and	like	Ana	hesitated	to	tell	her	age,	except</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	an	entirely	different	reason.	She	finally	admitted	to	being	a	little	over	forty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 was	 tall	 for	 a	 woman	 at	 five-ten	 and	 thin,	 with	 long	 blonde	 hair	 and confident	blue	eyes	that	reflected	her	confidence	and	drive.	Al	guessed	she	was not	 going	 to	 be	 laying	 around	 for	 long.	 They	 stayed	 with	 her	 for	 several	 hours and	then	used	the	floating	gurney	to	move	her	to	the	habitat	ring.	Ana	relocated into	 a	 larger	 quarters	 across	 the	 hall,	 and	 Liz	 moved	 in	 with	 her.	 As	 expected, Liz	was	quick	to	recover.	Within	a	few	hours,	she	was	up	and	helping	Ana	make</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	place	more	livable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ana	wished	out	loud,	“It	sure	would	be	nice	to	have	some	sheets	and	pillows, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	maybe	some	towels.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	don’t	you	ask	the	service	bots?	They’ll	get	whatever	we	need.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	how	to	call	them	with	the	computer	terminals	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	don’t	need	a	terminal.	There	are	three	hab	bots	per	section	in	this	habitat ring.	 They’re	 stored	 under	 the	 floor	 of	 the	 corridor	 when	 they	 aren’t	 needed—</p>
<p class="calibre1">here;	I’ll	show	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz	 got	 up	 and	 walked	 out	 to	 the	 passageway,	 with	 Ana	 following	 right behind.	On	the	floor	in	the	middle	of	the	corridor	was	a	faint	circle,	with	a	button on	the	wall	and	a	tiny	 <i class="calibre4">Service</i>	label.	Liz	pushed	the	button,	and	a	small	open	lift rose	up	from	below.	They	boarded	the	elevator	and	pressed	the	down	button. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under	 the	 floor	 was	 a	 small	 room	 with	 three	 robots	 lined	 up;	 waiting	 for orders.	Liz	stepped	in	front	of	the	first	robot,	which	had	several	small	dents	on its	 pale	 blue	 body,	 and	 said,	 “Robot	 Nine,	 we	 require	 sheets,	 light	 blankets, pillows,	and	towels	for	four	people.”	She	smiled	at	Ana	and	added,	“Also,	find</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 colonists	 work	 clothes	 for	 Anastasia	 Kossalowski	 and	 Elizabeth	 Morris, and...coffee,	with	cream	and	sugar.	Bring	everything	to	Living	Quarters	number</p>
<p class="calibre1">fourteen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>Robot	 Nine	 acknowledged	 the	 order,	 boarded	 the	 lift,	 and	 within	 thirty seconds	he	disappeared	with	the	lift.	When	the	platform	came	back	down,	Ana</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	Liz	returned	to	their	quarters	and	resumed	setting	up	their	apartment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fifteen	minutes	later	the	robot	returned	with	their	bedding	and	towels.	It	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaving	 their	 quarters	 and	 headed	 down	 the	 corridor	 for	 its	 second	 trip	 when Chris	and	Al	opened	their	door	and	stepped	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	saw	it	first	and	yelled,	“Hey...robot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	robot	stopped,	turned	around	and	said,	“How	may	I	be	of	service?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	closer,”	Al	ordered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	robot	beeped	and	then	advanced	to	stop	in	front	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	asked	Chris,	“Didn’t	the	robot	that	went	nuts	have	a	nine	on	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	it	did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	did	you	try	to	kill	us?”	Al	challenged	the	robot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	sorry	sir.	I	did	not	try	to	kill	you—I	was	experiencing	a	malfunction.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 thought,  <i class="calibre4">That	 must	 have	 been	 some	 experience. </i>“Are	 you	 done</p>
<p class="calibre1">malfunctioning?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes	sir,	I	was	taken	to	the	robotics	shop	and	repaired.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you	won’t	be	banging	into	walls	anymore?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	if	I	can	help	it,	sir.	The	walls	are	very	strong.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	appeared	to	be	functioning	correctly.	Although,	there	was	an	unusual	touch</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	humor.	Al	chuckled	and	said,	“Ok...well...carry-on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	women	overheard	the	commotion	and	joined	the	men	in	the	hallway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	four	humans	watched	as	the	little	robot	rolled	away	to	return	to	its	duties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nice	robot,”	Ana	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	 if	 you	 like	 killer	 robots,”	 answered	 Chris.	 “That	 one	 almost	 ran	 us over.”	 He	 grinned	 and	 turned	 to	 Al,	 “What	 if	 he’s	 not	 telling	 the	 truth	 about being	repaired?” </p>

THEY	 GATHERED	 IN	 THE	 women’s	 quarters	 to	 eat	 and	 discuss	 their	 next<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">move.	 Four	 people	 in	 a	 massive	 sleeping	 ship	 facing	 some	 serious	 decisions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still,	they	were	alive	and	awake,	and	they	had	options. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	we	do	now,	Mom?	Wake	the	captain?”	Chris	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz	 replied,	 “The	 original	 plan	 was	 to	 wake	 a	 hiber-pod	 technician,	 who would	 then	 wake	 a	 doctor,	 and	 then	 the	 two	 would	 wake	 another	 technician. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 there	 were	 two	 technicians	 and	 a	 doctor	 available,	 they	 could	 revive	 the captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>Liz	was	a	member	of	senior	staff	and	knew	the	ship	well.	She	was	on	board for	 almost	 a	 year	 before	 they	 left	 Earth’s	 orbit,	 and	 had	 become	 very	 familiar with	the	spacecraft.	Inside	a	secret	compartment	in	her	pod,	a	storage	space	only her	hand	could	open,	was	her	top	clearance	key	card.	Al	was	glad	they	revived</p>
<p class="calibre1">her.	Things	would	go	much	smoother	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	continued,	“I	would	like	to	try	and	restore	the	computer	terminals.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">computer	 could	 tell	 us	 a	 lot.	 The	 passenger	 access	 was	 shut	 down	 for	 the	 trip, and	if	everything	is	undamaged,	it	shouldn’t	take	much	to	get	them	back	online. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	we	had	working	terminals,	we	could	get	the	list	of	 <i class="calibre4">who</i>	to	wake	up	 <i class="calibre4">when</i>	and	a lot	more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	volunteered,	“I	could	go	with	you.	Maybe	Al	could	help	Ana	get	ready</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	more	patients?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 suggested,	 “We	 could	 also	 make	 a	 list	 of	 the	 doctors	 and	 check	 to	 see what	condition	they	are	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 decided	 Al	 and	 Ana	 would	 prepare	 to	 revive	 more	 people.	 Chris	 and his	 mother	 would	 go	 to	 restore	 the	 terminals.	 They	 spent	 a	 couple	 of	 hours talking	 and	 getting	 to	 know	 each	 other	 and	 then	 returned	 to	 their	 separate quarters	with	their	blankets,	sheets,	and	pillows	to	get	some	rest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 morning,	 there	 was	 coffee	 and	 breakfast	 packages,	 and	 then	 they gathered	 their	 things	 and	 went	 their	 separate	 ways	 to	 begin	 bringing	 their	 ship back	to	life. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Chris	and	his	mother	headed	for	the	computer	relay	station	located	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">center	of	the	ring.	As	they	rode	the	lift	up	to	the	hub,	she	explained	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	needed	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	 is	 a	 relay	 in	 the	 hub	 that	 is	 fed	 from	 the	 ship’s	 computer	 located beneath	the	shuttle	bay.	We	need	to	close	a	few	breakers	and	re-establish	the	link to	the	passenger	terminals.	Pretty	simple	really.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	unexpectedly	admitted,	“I	am	so	glad	you’re	here	Mom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz	looked	at	her	son,	a	worried	look	on	her	face,	“You’ve	had	a	rough	time</p>
<p class="calibre1">here.	How	are	you—I	mean	really?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 okay	 Mom.	 Things	 are	 much	 better	 now.	 If	 you	 want	 to	 know	 how	 I managed	 my	 time	 alone,	 you’ll	 have	 to	 read	 my	 journal.	 I	 even	 did	 some drawings.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	smiled	at	him	and	touched	his	cheek.	“I	look	forward	to	that.”	She	took	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">step	 back	 and	 looked	 him	 up	 and	 down,	 “You’ve	 grown	 so	 much,	 and	 you	 act just	like	your	father.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	replied,	“I	should	be	so	lucky.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	miss	him,	don’t	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	mom,	very	much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	miss	him	too,”	she	said,	and	added,	“They	say	time	heals	all	wounds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hope	that’s	true	Mom,	I	really	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly	uncomfortable,	she	changed	the	subject,	“You	need	a	haircut.	I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">gonna	have	to	take	care	of	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	grinned,	shook	his	head	and	opened	the	lift	hatch.	In	the	hub,	the	lights came	 on,	 and	 he	 made	 a	 quick	 three-sixty	 around	 the	 circular	 room;	 gracefully returning	to	his	mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	couldn’t	help	myself,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	understand	that,	but	we’ve	got	work	to	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	Mother.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	panel	they	needed	was	embedded	in	the	wall	by	the	main	ship	door.	Liz</p>
<p class="calibre1">opened	the	panel,	reset	the	breakers,	and	realigned	the	signal.	A	small	screen	in the	compartment	lit	up	with	the	 <i class="calibre4">Excalibur</i>	logo,	and	just	that	quickly	their	task was	complete.	The	terminals	were	online. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>They	 couldn’t	 help	 themselves	 from	 spending	 a	 few	 minutes	 playing	 in	 the hub	before	they	headed	back. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
AL	RETRIEVED	THE	CODEBOOK,	and	he	and	Ana	sat	down	to	work	on	their<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">list.	Going	through	the	ledger	was	a	tedious	and	time-consuming	job.	Rank	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">used	 to	 arrange	 the	 book	 instead	 of	 by	 profession,	 which	 required	 them	 to	 go through	 the	 entire	 list	 looking	 for	 doctors.	 They	 found	 four	 doctors	 and	 one surgeon	before	Al	heard	the	room’s	computer	powering	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Computers	are	up,”	he	told	Ana. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	 right!”	 She	 exclaimed,	 “Now	 we	 can	 find	 out	 what	 we	 need	 the	 easy way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	jumped	up	 and	ran	to	 the	desk	to	 find	the	  <i class="calibre4">Excalibur</i>	logo	displayed	on the	monitor	with	a	flashing	telltale	that	stated— <i class="calibre4">Ready	for	input</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Computer,	show	me	a	list	arranged	by	priority,	of	the	people	to	wake	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	reach	Avalon.	Display	the	first	twelve	names.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	took	only	a	few	moments	to	find	the	doctor	they	needed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	looks	like	we	need	to	find	a	Doctor	Ian	Trask,	pod	number	one-hundred</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	four.	He	was	to	be	the	third	person	revived,”	Ana	explained	to	Al. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ana’s	 mind	 jumped	 to	 a	 new	 question.	 “Computer,	 what	 is	 our	 current</p>
<p class="calibre1">location?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 location	 is	 the	 habitat	 ring—LQ	 fourteen,”	 said	 the	 computer	 in	 a strong	woman’s	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	us—you	idiot—the	ship.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Insufficient	information.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean,	insufficient	information?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sensors	are	currently	off-line,”	the	computer	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cause	unknown.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	blind	without	sensors,	as	the	computer	had	no	way	to	determine</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	they	were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Computer,	what	is	the	current	date?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 current	 date	 is	 December	 twenty-first,	 two	 thousand	 two	 hundred	 and one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ana	 frowned	 and	 looked	 at	 Al,	 “We	 left	 Earth	  <i class="calibre4">more</i>	 than	 forty	 years	 ago? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Did	we	miss	Avalon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 found	 the	 information	 disheartening,	 and	 admitted,	 “We	 could	 be	 just outside	our	solar	system	or	ten	years	past	Avalon,	we	just	won’t	know	until	we</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>get	the	sensors	back.	Let’s	get	ready	to	wake	the	doctor,	and	then	we	can	wake our	other	technician,	and	then	the	captain.	When	we	get	to	that	point,	maybe	we can	worry	more	about	where	in	space	we	are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	problem	at	a	time—right?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exactly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 met	 up	 with	 Chris	 and	 Liz	 on	 their	 way	 to	 the	 lift	 and	 together	 they went	to	the	hiber-pod	bay	to	find	a	doctor.	To	their	dismay,	Doctor	Ian	Traskow died	 years	 ago.	 He	 was	 a	 shrunken,	 dried-out	 facsimile	 of	 a	 human	 being,	 and would	never	help	anyone	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second	 on	 their	 list,	 was	 Doctor	 Jacody	 Mumbada.	 When	 they	 located	 his pod,	they	found	a	pleasant	looking	black	man	around	thirty	years	old	that	was	a trauma	care	doctor	and	a	cardiac	specialist.	According	to	the	computer,	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">Doctor	Traskow’s	backup	replacement.	His	pod	also	had	the	troubling	red	light, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	he	was	reasonably	young,	and	through	the	mist	in	the	window	he	appeared</p>
<p class="calibre1">healthy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ana	prepared	the	hiber-pod	to	begin	the	revival	cycle,	and	set	the	timer	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">eight	 hours,	 as	 she	 had	 done	 with	 Liz.	 She	 stayed	 behind	 to	 monitor	 Doctor Mumbada’s	 pod	 while	 the	 rest	 of	 them	 prepared	 the	 medical	 center.	 After	 they completed	 their	 preparations,	 the	 four	 of	 them	 sat	 down	 to	 discuss	 the	 second hiber-pod	technician	they	required. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 name	 that	 the	 computer	 suggested	 was	 not	 the	 technician	 that	 Ana wanted	to	wake.	She	had	a	friend	aboard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 know	 this	 woman—I’ve	 worked	 with	 her	 before	 I	 came	 to	 the	 ship,	 and she	is	an	excellent	technician.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shouldn’t	we	be	following	the	computer	recommendations,”	reminded	Liz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	believed	in	 <i class="calibre4">by	the	book</i>	procedures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ana	 was	 quick	 to	 reply,	 “I	 need	 to	 know	 I	 have	 someone	 I	 can	 work	 with. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under	these	conditions,	we	don’t	have	time	for	personality	clashes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	Ana	is	right,”	Al	said,	“We	do	have	to	get	along	with	one	another	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">we’re	going	to	speed	this	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually,	 Liz	 reconsidered,	 and	 they	 decided	 to	 wake	 Ana’s	 friend.	 Chris was	for	whatever	Ana	was	for,	so	Elizabeth	was	effectively	outvoted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	doctor’s	pod	slid	open,	Chris	and	Al	loaded	him	onto	the	floating</p>
<p class="calibre1">stretcher	and	took	him	to	the	medical	center.	Once	there	and	under	Ana’s	care, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	recovered	quickly,	his	first	words	were—of	course,	“Where	Am	I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	new	shipmates	went	through	the	explanation	process	again,	introducing</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves	 and	 informing	 the	 physician	 of	 their	 plight.	 Ana	 continued	 to administer	 to	 Doctor	 Mumbada	 while	 the	 others	 went	 to	 prepare	 for	 another awakening.	 They	 only	 needed	 one	 more	 person,	 and	 they	 could	 wake	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>captain.	 Hopefully,	 when	 he	 joined	 them,	 the	 highly	 trained	 and	 experienced officer	could	start	making	sense	of	their	situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 was	 elected	 to	 return	 to	 the	 habitat	 ring	 and	 have	 the	 robots	 prepare	 a room	 for	 the	 doctor.	 Liz	 told	 him	 how	 to	 access	 the	 robot’s	 storage	 space,	 and tired	of	sitting,	he	grabbed	his	stuff	and	got	moving.	An	hour	later,	he	was	in	the robots	cubby	hole	and	standing	in	front	of	robot	number	nine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Robot	Nine,	I	need	you	and	your	two	friends	to	prepare	quarters	just	aft	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">mine	 for	 Doctor	 Jacody	 Mumbada.	 He	 will	 require	 bedding,	 towels,	 and	 work clothing.	Because	he’s	a	doctor,	he	will	need	a	portable	medical	kit.	Can	you	do all	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.	I	can	procure	what	you	request.	Will	he	require	coffee?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	smiled	and	said,	“Sure,	why	not?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that	all,	sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes...but	give	me	a	minute	to	get	out	of	your	way	before	you	leave.	I	don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">want	you	or	your	friends	to	run	me	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	robot	beeped,	hesitated	for	a	second,	and	then	in	a	little	higher	voice;	it said,	 “I	 would	 never	 do	 that	 sir.	 We	 are	 programmed	 not	 to	 cause	 damage;	 to anyone	or	anything.	What	good	is	a	robot	that	hurts	people	and	breaks	things?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well—keep	that	in	mind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	boarded	the	lift	and	rode	it	up	to	the	corridor.	As	soon	as	he	stepped	off, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 platform	 went	 back	 down	 to	 pick	 up	 the	 habitat	 robots.	 When	 the	 little elevator	returned,	the	three	little	robots	scurried	down	the	corridor	to	fulfill	Al’s orders.	He	figured	he	had	some	time	to	query	the	computer	about	Al	Clark,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	was	the	perfect	time	to	do	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	data	available,”	the	computer	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	about...,	the	habitat	ring,	orange	section,	quarters	number	twenty-five? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	room	labeled	Al	Clark.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	data	available.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	was	perplexed.  <i class="calibre4">“Did	Al	Clark	even	exist?” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 asked	 the	 computer	 to	 search	 for	 any	 information	 concerning	 Al	 Clark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	tried	Alvin	Clark,	Albert	Clark,	Al*Clark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	data	available.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 not	 going	 to	 learn	 anything.	 The	 computer	 had	 no	 record	 of	 him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Disappointed,	he	got	up	and	left	to	see	if	he	could	help	the	others.	He	could	hear them	 coming	 down	 the	 spoke	 long	 before	 he	 saw	 them,	 the	 sound	 of	 the	 lift echoing	with	people’s	voices	and	laughter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ship	was	slowly	coming	alive,	and	the	chatter	of	happy	people	improved</p>
<p class="calibre1">Al’s	 mood.	 He	 was	 waiting	 in	 the	 airlock	 when	 the	 lift	 doors	 slid	 open,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>laughter	exploded	into	the	airlock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 doctor	 believes	 in	 voodoo,”	 Chris	 proclaimed.	 “Doctor	 Mumbada	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	Haiti.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	a	refined	Haitian	accent,	the	doctor	was	trying	to	explain,	“That	is	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	I	said.	What	I	did	say	is	medicine	comes	in	many	forms.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	 shot	 back,	 “I’m	 just	 saying	 if	 I	 find	 a	 little	 doll	 made	 of	 straw	 under my	pillow,	I’m	coming	to	see	you	first.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 doctor	 was	 laughing	 and	 shaking	 his	 head.	 “You	 are	 a	 silly	 boy, Christopher.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	they	had	installed	him	in	his	quarters,	they	gave	him	a	couple	of	hours</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	pull	himself	together,	and	then	gathered	once	again	in	the	women’s	quarters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Robot	 Nine	 procured	 an	 extra	 chair,	 and	 they	 made	 room	 for	 the	 doctor	 at	 the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 a	 tall,	 light	 featured	 black	 man	 with	 short	 black	 hair,	 deep	 brown eyes,	 and	 spoke	 his	 English	 with	 a	 slight	 accent.	 He	 was	 the	 kind	 of	 person where	all	you	had	to	do	was	see	him,	hear	a	few	sentences,	and	you	could	make</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	good	guess	where	he	came	from. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	asked	him,	“What’s	all	this	about	voodoo,	Doctor	Mumbada?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please,	call	me	Cody.	I	much	prefer	that.	We	are	all	one	family	now,	and	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	not	need	to	be	so	formal.	I	was	just	explaining	to	young	Chris,	that	our	world is	a	mysterious	place,	and	there	are	many	things	we	do	not	understand.	One	must keep	an	open	mind.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	you’re	saying	that	voodoo	is	real?”	Ana	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Having	 spent	 most	 of	 my	 childhood	 in	 Haiti,	 I	 have	 seen	 many	 amazing things.	 Voodoo	 is	 not	 always	 meant	 to	 be	 evil,	 and	 the	 power	 to	 influence another	person’s	mind	can	be	useful	for	many	things.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Young	Chris	had	a	fresh	hair	cut,	and	looking	younger	still;	he	chided,	“I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	gonna	be	checking	under	my	pillow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	conversation	made	Al	feel	hopeful.	These	were	the	kind	of	people	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	save	their	piece	of	humanity,	and	it	looked	like	they	might	have	a	little	fun along	the	way. </p><p class="calibre1">

THE	 NAME	 OF	 ANA’S	 FRIEND	 was	 Kayla	 Hamilton,	 and	 they	 found	 her	 in<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">the	same	troubling	condition	as	the	others;	excepting	Ana	and	poor	Dr.	Traskow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 little	 red	 light	 was	 prevalent	 through	 most	 of	 the	 hiber-pod	 bay,	 and	 why Ana’s	pod	did	not	would	remain	a	mystery. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Kayla	was	a	sweet,	thoughtful	woman.	One	of	those	rare	people	who	listened</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	 than	 she	 spoke.	 She	 paid	 attention	 to	 whatever	 you	 said,	 and	 made	 every person	she	spoke	with	feel	special.	She	was	in	her	early	thirties,	with	dark	brown hair	cut	short,	mesmerizing	green	eyes,	and	had	no	trouble	finding	a	place	in	the group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	elated	to	see	Ana	was	the	technician	that	woke	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	they	had	everyone	they	needed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Captain	Tobias	Effinger	was	a	career	officer	and	an	excellent	pilot.	He	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">signed	up	for	the	mission	because	once	the	 <i class="calibre4">Excalibur</i>	established	a	stable orbit,	he	would	be	free	to	fly	the	versatile	little	shuttles	back	and	forth	to	Avalon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz	 met	 him	 several	 times	 at	 different	 functions	 and	 got	 the	 impression	 of	 a friendly,	no-nonsense	type	of	person.	He	confided	in	her	that	his	application	was almost	turned	down	due	to	his	age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 fifty-two	 and	 past	 his	 prime.	 However,	 he	 still	 turned	 out	 to	 be	 the best	candidate	for	the	job;	the	best	they	had	left	on	Earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	they	gathered	around	the	captain’s	pod,	they	discovered	an	additional</p>
<p class="calibre1">problem.	 His	 pod	 had	 red	 lights	 on	 the	 outside,	 and	 under	 the	 cover	 of	 the control	 panel,	 there	 were	 more	 crimson	 warnings.	 The	 meter	 monitoring	 his heartbeat	 registered	 twice	 the	 normal	 rhythm	 and	 indicated	 the	 captain	 was quietly	struggling	for	his	life. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The	two	hiber-pod	technicians	looked	doubtful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have	you	ever	revived	someone	in	this	condition?”	Ana	asked	Kayla. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	we	need	to	check	the	computer	for	hiber-pod	emergency	procedures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe	there	is	something	in	there	that	can	help,”	Ana	proclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 two	 women	 ran	 to	 the	 medical	 center	 to	 use	 one	 of	 the	 computer terminals,	leaving	the	doctor	to	stare	at	a	struggling	patient	he	could	not	reach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Computer,	show	me	emergency	procedures	for	a	hiber-pod	occupant	having</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart	problems,”	Ana	requested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	short	delay	of	the	response	was	aggravating,	but	after	a	few	seconds,	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">displayed	what	they	needed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	 as	 I	 thought,	 there	 is	 an	 accelerated	 two-hour	 cycle.	 We	 have	 got	 to go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	rushed	back	and	started	the	cycle.	Two	hours	is	a	lifetime	when	it’s	life</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 death.	 They	 followed	 the	 procedure	 outlined	 by	 the	 computer,	 and	 when	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>pod	finally	opened	up,	the	doctor	took	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay	quick,	get	him	onto	the	stretcher	and	to	the	medical	center.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	and	Al	did	as	the	physician	asked,	and	rushed	him	to	a	bed	where	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">doctor	 could	 properly	 treat	 him.	 Ana	 and	 Kayla	 helped	 get	 the	 captain	 off	 the stretcher	and	onto	the	bed,	hooked	up	to	an	I.V,	and	then	prepare	the	machines</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	doctor	requested.	He	asked	Ana	if	she	would	like	to	assist,	and	told	everyone else	to	leave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 rest	 of	 the	 group	 waited	 outside	 and	 discussed	 the	 new	 developments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 were	 chairs	 in	 a	 small	 waiting	 room	 across	 the	 hall	 and	 through	 the	 two walls	of	thick	dusty	plastic,	they	could	see	fuzzy	images	of	the	doctor	and	Ana working	feverishly	to	save	the	captain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	in	case,	should	we	go	and	check	the	first	officer’s	pod?”	asked	Chris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s	next	in	line	so	that	would	be	the	proper	thing	to	do,”	offered	Elizabeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kayla	asked,	“If	the	captain	doesn’t	make	it.	What	if	we	can’t	wake	the	first</p>
<p class="calibre1">officer?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 if	 we’re	 not	 able	 to	 wake	 enough	 people	 to	 run	 the	 ship?”	 Chris wondered	out	aloud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elizabeth	frowned	in	thought,	and	Al	saw	worry	growing	on	the	faces	of	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">new-found	friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	if	none	of	it	matters,	and	we’re	a	zillion	miles	from	nowhere,”	added</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 interrupted	 their	 many	 questions,	 “I	 think	 we	 might	 be	 getting	 ahead	 of ourselves,	we	should	have	faith	in	both	Ana	and	Doctor	Cody.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 trying	 to	 be	 the	 voice	 of	 reason,	 and	 could	 not	 allow	 panic	 to	 take over	their	thinking.	“I	think	we	should	wait,	and	give	them	a	chance	to	do	what they	do.	Whatever	happens,	we	can	figure	it	out	from	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 surgery	 took	 a	 long	 time;	 seemingly	 forever.	 Eventually,	 bloody	 and tired,	 Ana	 came	 out	 to	 talk	 to	 them	 and	 to	 report	 that	 the	 doctor	 believed	 the captain	had	a	good	chance.	“He	will	have	to	take	it	easy	for	a	few	days.	In	time, he	should	fully	recover.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 moved	 Captain	 Effinger	 to	 one	 of	 the	 recovery	 rooms,	 and	 Cody</p>
<p class="calibre1">accompanied	 them.	 The	 doctor	 requested	 a	 sleeping	 bag	 and	 had	 Robot	 Nine bring	 them	 their	 meals,	 who	 Al	 temporarily	 assigned	 to	 the	 doctor.	 The	 robot seemed	happy	to	be	of	service. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	Cody	nearby,	Ana	and	Kayla	prepared	to	revive	more	people	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">assistance	of	two	service	bots. </p><p class="calibre1">

<a id="p57"></a>AL,	 CHRIS,	 AND	 LIZ	 went	 to	 see	 what	 they	 could	 do	 about	 restoring	 the sensors.	 All	 their	 future	 plans	 hinged	 on	 knowing	 where	 in	 the	 universe	 they were.	 Liz	 informed	 them	 the	 ship’s	 sensor	 array	 was	 located	 below	 the	 shuttle bay	 in	 the	 main	 computer	 room.	 She	 led	 them	 through	 the	 hiber-pod	 bay	 and stopped	 by	 the	 airlock	 door	 leading	 the	 next	 module.	 A	 faded	 sign	 spelled	 out, <p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">‘Shuttle	Bay.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	was	relieved	 that—to	this	point—there	 was	little	evidence	 of	damage	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 ship,	 excluding	 the	 large	 ragged	 hole	 in	 the	 green	 section	 of	 the	 ring.	 The Farm	and	Park	module	was	well	developed	and	appeared	to	have	been	operating</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 years	 with	 the	 help	 of	 the	 robots.	 As	 far	 as	 he	 could	 tell,	 the	 ship	 was remarkably	intact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes,	the	starship	was	old,	but	it	seemed	fundamentally	sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Hangar	Bay	was	different. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	they	opened	the	door	into	the	hangar	area,	they	found	chaos.	Pieces	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">debris	littered	the	deck,	and	two	of	the	five	shuttles	were	damaged.	One	ship	was beyond	 repair	 with	 a	 jagged	 twelve-inch	 hole	 driven	 through	 the	 middle.	 The ceiling	 of	 the	 hangar	 bay	 showed	 evidence	 of	 a	 similar	 sized	 hole	 and	 several smaller	ones	that	had	self-repaired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 a	 long	 trip	 such	 as	 the	 one	 undertaken	 by	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Excalibur</i>,	 situations	 like this	 were	 anticipated,	 and	 the	 securing	 of	 everything	 that	 could	 become	 a projectile	taken	very	seriously.	It	could	have	been	a	lot	worse.	Flying	tools	and parts	 can	 cause	 a	 considerable	 amount	 of	 damage.	 The	 parts	 liberated	 from	 the destroyed	shuttle	had	crashed	into	the	craft	next	to	it,	leaving	numerous	repairs necessary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	path	of	the	meteoroids	was	evident,	and	the	flying	rocks	had	continued</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	 to	 the	 lower	 compartments.	 A	 rapid	 decompression	 occurred,	 and	 until the	 ship	 repaired	 itself,	 this	 area	 and	 the	 compartments	 below	 were	 open	 to space.	In	one	of	the	compartments	below	was	the	computer	room	and	the	sensor</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrays	they	sought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	need	to	get	down	there	and	check	the	computer,”	declared	Liz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 ran	 to	 the	 lift	 and	 rode	 it	 down	 to	 the	 computer	 room.	 While	 the seemingly	 slow	 elevator	 descended,	 more	 and	 more	 of	 the	 small	 room	 became visible	until	the	culprit	that	caused	the	bulk	of	the	damage	was	revealed.	Lying in	the	center	of	the	floor	was	the	remains	of	a	broken	and	scarred	meteoroid;	its energy	 spent.	 Before	 the	 lift	 stopped,	 Liz	 jumped	 off	 and	 ran	 to	 the	 main computer.	She	checked	each	component	and	was	relieved	to	find	little	damage.	A</p>
<p class="calibre1">few	sections	had	tiny	holes	bored	into	them	which	she	inspected	carefully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 need	 to	 run	 some	 tests,	 and	 probably	 replace	 a	 few	 circuit	 boards,	 but	 I think	we’re	okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>She	turned	around	to	peer	at	the	sensor	array,	and	said,	“This,	however,	is	a different	story.	It’s	going	to	take	some	work	to	get	it	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Numerous	 holes	 peppered	 the	 array	 components,	 and	 some	 pieces	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">missing	entirely.	They	were	going	to	be	blind	for	a	while	longer. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
THE	 CAPTAIN	 WAS	 AWAKE	 when	 they	 returned	 to	 the	 medical	 center, <p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">although	 still	 weak	 and	 pale.	 The	 people	 responsible	 for	 waking	 him	 gathered around	his	bed	in	the	recovery	room	and	made	their	introductions.	To	Liz,	their new	leader	said,	“Good	to	see	you	again.”	And	then	he	said	the	same	thing	to	Al. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	 you	 know	 me?”	 It	 struck	 Al	 that	 he	 was	 talking	 to	 the	 captain,	 and	 he quickly	added,	“Sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	captain	looked	confused,	and	his	eyebrows	dipped.	“You’re	my	Security</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chief...right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	a	Security	Officer?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	captain’s	confusion	changed	to	concern,	“Are	you	joking	with	me	Mister</p>
<p class="calibre1">Clark?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sorry	sir,	but...have	we	met	before?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyes	darted	around	the	room,	and	the	captain	replied	slowly,	“Well...yes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">just	before	departure.	Are	you	all	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	all	right	sir;	I’m	just	having	a	little	trouble	with	my	memory.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	is	unfortunate.”	The	captain	hesitated,	and	then	added,	“I’m	sure	it	will come	back	to	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	appeared	a	little	uncomfortable	and	quickly	moved	on	to	bigger	concerns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 addressed	 all	 of	 them	 and	 asked	 for	 a	 status	 on	 their	 situation.	 They	 filled him	in	on	what	they	knew,	including	the	condition	of	the	ship,	the	shuttles,	and with	the	sensors	down,	that	they	were	unable	to	determine	their	location. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Elizabeth,	I	need	you	to	take	Mister	Clark	and	get	the	sensors	back	online. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	rest	of	you	will	concentrate	on	waking	the	rest	of	the	crew	according	to	the procedure	 outlined	 in	 the	 computer.	 We	 need	 to	 bring	 this	 ship	 back	 to operational	status	as	quickly	as	possible	and	get	on	with	the	mission.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Effinger	asked	the	physician,	“When	can	I	get	out	of	here	and	get	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">work?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hold	on	sir.	You	just	had	heart	surgery	and	are	going	to	require	a	minimum</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	a	few	days	in	bed,	and	then	a	week	or	two	of	restricted	duty.	There	is	no	sense in	my	saving	you	if	you	just	turn	around	and	kill	yourself...,	Sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right	then,	but	let’s	try	and	hurry	this	up.	From	what	you’ve	told	me,	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 a	 lot	 of	 work	 to	 do.	 Oh...let’s	 see	 what	 we	 can	 do	 about	 overriding	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>spoke	 lifts	 that	 are	 still	 usable.	 We’re	 going	 to	 need	 as	 much	 access	 as	 we	 can get.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	leader	was	awake,	and	now	they	had	direction.	The	captain’s	new	crew</p>
<p class="calibre1">breathed	a	hopeful	sigh	of	relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a><img src="index-60_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Nine</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	was	feeling	good.	He	now	had	a	name	and	profession.	The	computer</p>
<p class="calibre1">outlined	his	position	and	its	requirements.	However,	it	made	no	mention</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 who	 was	 to	 be	 in	 charge.	 Al	 assumed	 that	 he,	 like	 Chris,	 was	 a	 last-minute addition	to	the	crew	that	someone	had	forgotten	to	add	to	the	computer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	 Liz	 was	 busy	 doing	 repairs	 on	 the	 sensor	 array,	 he	 used	 a	 nearby terminal	to	find	five	security	officers	that	met	his	criteria.	He	would	discuss	this with	 the	 captain,	 but	 Al	 thought	 a	 security	 team	 should	 be	 high	 on	 their	 list	 of priorities.	 It	 was	 not	 hard	 to	 find	 five	 men	 that	 were	 all	 experienced	 with exemplary	records.	Yes,	he	was	feeling	pretty	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	made	sense	 that	he	was	 security.	The	captain's	 statement	explained	many</p>
<p class="calibre1">things:	 the	 uniform,	 the	 sidearm,	 the	 keys,	 and	 his	 high-security	 clearance.	 He thought	 that	 he	 was	 going	 to	 like	 this	 job,	 and	 was	 anxious	 to	 return	 to	 the orange	section	and	set	up	his	office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	did	what	he	could	to	assist	the	two	hiber-pod	technicians.	It	was	not	his field	of	study,	but	he	was	a	good	listener	and	followed	orders	willingly.	They	had awakened	 two	 more	 people;	 the	 first	 officer,	 and	 a	 helmsman.	 Both	 were	 now settling	into	their	quarters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 captain	 was	 recovering	 at	 a	 remarkable	 pace	 and	 was	 to	 be	 released	 to return	to	duty	the	following	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	Christmas	Eve,	and	earlier	in	the	day,	the	captain	decided	that	a	party</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	in	order.	He	offered	the	use	of	the	observation	lounge,	which	was	spacious</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough	 for	 the	 number	 of	 people	 attending.	 After	 all,	 there	 were	 only	 ten	 of them.	The	group	considered	Robot	Nine	as	one	of	them,	and	he	was	invited	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">play	bartender	and	all	around	go-getter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 gathered	 in	 the	 hub	 and	 practiced	  <i class="calibre4">flying</i>	 in	 the	 zero	 gravity	 until	 the captain	 arrived	 on	 a	 floating	 gurney	 with	 Doctor	 Cody	 driving.	 The	 makeshift crew	was	officially	off-duty	for	the	first	time	since	their	revival,	and	they	were	in the	mood	for	a	celebration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Effinger’s	condition	was	much	improved,	and	he	radiated	confidence</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 the	 future.	 “Maybe	 we’ll	 see	 something	 we	 recognize	 through	 large panoramic	windows.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	captain’s	card	that	opened	the	door,	and	they	entered	one	by	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	the	observation	area.	The	sight	of	their	lives	awaited	them.	Silence	ruled	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>moment	as	they	were	overwhelmed	with	what	they	saw	out	the	large	transparent window.	 The	 captain’s	 wish	 had	 come	 true,	 and	 they	 finally	 knew	 where	 they were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly	circling	below	them	was	the	most	beautiful	planet	they	had	ever	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clear	 blue	 skies	 with	 a	 sprinkling	 of	 cloud	 cover	 hovered	 over	 the	 landscape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Land	 complete	 with	 mountains	 topped	 in	 white,	 green	 valleys,	 and	 massive rolling	flatlands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 oceans	 were	 immense	 and	 blue,	 reflecting	 the	 sunlight	 back	 to	 their eyes.	There	was	not	a	hint	of	pollution,	flat	tracks	of	land,	or	even	cities.	What they	looked	down	on	could	only	be	Avalon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	realization	sunk	in;	pandemonium	broke	out.	Everyone	was	talking</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	once,	and	except	for	the	captain,	was	jumping	up	and	down	and	yelling.	Cody</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	to	hold	their	leader	down	to	keep	him	from	following	their	example. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	took	turns	looking	at	the	planet	through	the	small	telescope	mounted	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	lounge,	and	they	toasted	each	other.	They	talked	about	their	future	and	drank some	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	toasted	Christmas	Day	as	it	rolled	around,	and	marveled	at	the	fantastic</p>
<p class="calibre1">present	 slowly	 spinning	 below	 them.	 Robot	 Nine	 served	 drinks	 while	 they danced	and	drank	until	the	entire	planet	turned	and	displayed	itself	before	their hungry	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	best	party	any	of	them	had	ever	been	to,	or	would	ever	attend.	All</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	was	necessary	now	was	to	get	down	there,	and	a	little	later	than	planned—</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	would	finally	be	home. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
THERE	WAS	ALWAYS	A	price	to	pay	for	a	party	such	as	the	one	they	had.	Al<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">was	 the	 lucky	 one	 because,	 after	 the	 first	 couple	 sips,	 he	 decided	 he	 probably didn’t	 drink.	 The	 party	 lasted	 until	 morning,	 and	 almost	 everyone	 else	 had	 a hangover	to	contend	with	the	next	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	continued	bringing	the	ship	alive,	though,	and	soon	the	corridors	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">echoing	 with	 the	 sound	 of	 people,	 equipment,	 and	 habitat	 robots.	 With	 more humans	now	awake	and	settling	in,	the	robots	were	in	high	demand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Robot	Nine	seemed	attached	to	Al	and	was	always	nearby.	He	tried	sending</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	away	to	assist	other	people,	but	it	always	came	back;	awaiting	his	orders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 original	 six	 individuals	 to	 wake	 first	 were	 assigned	 quarters	 close	 to each	other	and	stayed	good	friends.	Known	as	the	 <i class="calibre4">First	Six</i>,	most	of	the	colonists considered	them	the	saviors	of	Excalibur,	and	of	the	people	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a>With	 all	 the	 additional	 people	 to	 help,	 repairs	 on	 the	 computer	 and	 sensor array	 were	 completed,	 and	 repairs	 of	 the	 remaining	 shuttles	 were	 well	 under way.	The	captain	scheduled	planetfall	for	the	following	month,	and	with	the	help of	 the	 sensors,	 they	 accumulated	 data	 on	 the	 planet	 and	 picked	 the	 most	 likely landing	sights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Computer,	how	long	have	we	been	at	Avalon?”	Al	queried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stable	orbit	was	established	ten	years,	two	months	and	twelve	days	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Ten	years	wasted! </i>	It	still	shocked	Al. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	was	no	one	revived	when	we	arrived?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	revival	circuits	were	disabled.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	mean	disabled...or	damaged?”	pressed	Al. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Disabled.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	a	human?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Affirmative.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	know	who	disabled	the	revival	circuits?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	data	available.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	 or	 someone’s,	 back	 on	 Earth,	 had	 wanted	 this	 sleeping	 ship	 to circle	 their	 new	 home	 until	 it	 was	 inhabited	 only	 by	 the	 dead.	 Their	 final destination	was	only	miles	away,	and	yet—unattainable. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Why	would	anyone	want	that? </i>	Al	wondered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later	that	day,	the	first	six	gathered	at	Liz	and	Chris’s	quarters	to	talk	about their	day	and	unwind.	Even	though	they	were	tired,	they	wanted	the	latest	news</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	retiring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	ship	was	sabotaged?”	Ana	asked	Al. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 sure	 looks	 that	 way.	 I	 asked	 the	 computer	 in	 as	 many	 ways	 as	 I	 could think	of	and	always	wound	up	with	the	same	conclusion.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	possibility	of	sabotage	was	hard	to	imagine.	That	someone	would	want</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 doom	 over	 a	 thousand	 innocent	 people	 to	 a	 long,	 slow	 death,	 was	 beyond comprehension. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	must	be	some	mistake.	I	do	not	think	it	possible,”	Cody	proclaimed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	squirmed	in	his	seat,	“I	find	it	hard	to	believe	too.	Still,	there	it	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kayla	 spoke	 up,	 “I	 remember	 a	 group	 of	 people	 that	 were	 convinced	 the colony	 ship	 program	 was	 a	 waste	 of	 time,	 resources,	 and	 money.	 The	 group claimed	the	colony	ships	were	for	the	conquest	of	other	planets.	They	believed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	lottery	was	rigged	and	only	the	wealthy	and	elite	would	be	allowed	aboard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	a	pretty	powerful	group	and	called	themselves	 <i class="calibre4">‘Earth	First,’	</i> I	 think. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	always	in	the	news	feeds....Do	you	think	they	could	have	done	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 a	 while,	 the	 group	 decided	 it	 didn’t	 matter.	 They	 were	 here,	 and	 they were	 awake.	 The	 universe	 had	 intervened	 and	 made	 things	 right.	 After	 forty</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>years,	 the	 settlers	 were	 now	 preparing	 to	 leave	 the	 ship	 and	 make	 a	 home	 on Avalon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	was	in	the	shuttle	bay	settling	a	minor	dispute	when	the	captain	came	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">inspect	the	now	pristine	and	organized	area.	Over	the	affections	of	a	woman,	one of	the	subjects	had	become	so	angry;	he	took	a	swing	at	the	other	who	promptly</p>
<p class="calibre1">reported	it	to	security.	Al	didn’t	mind,	if	this	were	the	worst	he	had	to	deal	with, he	could	live	with	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	captain	strolled	onto	the	shuttle	bay	followed	by	a	small	entourage	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">went	 straight	 to	 the	 head	 mechanic.	 “How	 are	 the	 repairs	 coming	 on	 the shuttles?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	will	be	ready	by	planetfall,	sir,”	The	man	replied	with	confidence. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“No	sir,	we	didn’t	feel	it	necessary	just	yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	captain,	not	usually	prone	to	anger,	had	to	restrain	himself	as	he	said,	“I want	 every	 shuttle	 thoroughly	 tested	 before	 the	 first	 passenger	 is	 allowed	 to board.	You	only	have	three	weeks	before	we	will	need	them.	Do	you	understand</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	spacecraft	have	been	sitting	around	for	years	and	will	require	exercise	and testing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes	sir,	I	will	get	right	on	that,”	the	red-faced	mechanic	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have	you	been	presented	with	a	pilot	roster	yet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Umm—not	quite	yet	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well	get	it	done,	and	make	sure	you	add	me	to	the	list.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	Captain,	you	can’t.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	hell	I	can’t.	Nobody	tells	me	I	can’t	fly.	You	are	dismissed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 captain	 noticed	 Al	 standing	 to	 the	 side,	 winked,	 and	 turned	 around	 to leave	with	his	group.	Al	was	impressed.	The	captain	knew	what	he	wanted,	and</p>

<p class="calibre1">Chris	 was	 helping	 repair	 of	 the	 shuttles.	 He	 was	 good	 at	 his	 job	 and	 loved working	on	the	tough,	versatile,	flying	machines.	Whenever	he	got	together	with any	of	the	group,	he	found	it	hard	to	talk	about	anything	else. </p>

<p class="calibre1">However,	they	too	were	bored.	There	was	not	a	lot	of	chatter	over	the	radios. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 would	 stop	 and	 visit	 his	 friends	 from	 time	 to	 time.	 Because	 they	 didn’t have	a	lot	of	time	to	chat,	he	would	move	on.	Sometimes,	he	would	stop	at	the</p>

ORBITAL	 OBSERVATION	 revealed	 a	 planet	 brimming	 with	 plant	 and	 animal<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">life.	Sun	drenched	valleys	rolled	gently	up	to	snow-capped	mountains,	and	swift streams	meandered	down	towards	the	deep	blue	oceans.	It	was	the	Earth	of	days</p>
<p class="calibre1">gone	 by	 with	 forests	 and	 prairies	 covering	 half	 of	 the	 landmass	 on	 the	 planet, with	 smaller	 islands	 to	 rival	 the	 old	 Jamaica	 or	 Hawaii	 of	 Earth.	 In	 a	 word, Avalon	was	paradise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several	 remote	 landing	 sites	 were	 selected	 and	 then	 narrowed	 down	 until they	settled	on	one	primary	site.	On	the	largest	landmass,	relatively	close	to	the equator,	they	found	their	new	home.	It	sat	at	the	foot	of	a	rust-colored	mountain, in	 a	 green	 valley	 close	 to	 a	 lazy	 blue	 river,	 and	 it	 was	 the	 perfect	 place	 to establish	the	first	colony	of	Avalon—a	place	they	named	Shangri-La. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>They	would	be	landing	in	early	spring,	and	the	homesteaders	would	have	the best	 part	 of	 spring	 plus	 all	 of	 summer	 and	 fall	 to	 prepare	 for	 winter.	 Average temperatures	on	the	surface	would	be	near	ideal	until	then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	 exploratory	 flight	 to	 the	 surface	 was	 scheduled	 and	 the	 crew	 members selected.

<p class="calibre1">The	  <i class="calibre4">Excalibur</i>	 was	 operating	 smoothly,	 and	 the	 captain/pilot	 had	 a	 good excuse	to	fly,	so	he	left	his	quite	capable	first	officer	to	manage	the	ship	in	his absence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 captain	 recognized	 the	 possibility	 of	 encountering	 indigenous	 natives and	therefore	decided	to	make	landfall	just	before	sunrise,	coming	straight	down from	the	sky	quickly	to	minimize	exposure.	They	would	stay	two	days. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“He	is	most	likely	curious	as	to	what	we	will	be	dealing	with	down	there,” </p>

<p class="calibre1">The	hangar	bay	was	full,	with	standing	room	only	at	departure.	Ship</p>
<p class="calibre1">security	set	up	barricades	for	a	wide	aisle	down	the	middle	of	the	shuttle</p>
<p class="calibre1">bay	to	contain	the	crowd.	The	first	humans	to	visit	Avalon	filed	in	and	boarded among	cheers	and	whistles,	with	the	captain	boarding	last. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 Al	 stepped	 up	 to	 the	 aircraft,	 he	 turned	 to	 the	 crowd	 and	 waved, hamming	it	up	while	thinking	of	the	age-old	tradition	of	cheering	and	throwing</p>
<p class="calibre1">confetti	 when	 a	 cruise	 ship	 leaves	 the	 dock.	 He	 was	 excited	 to	 be	 leaving, actually	feeling	sorry	for	the	people	that	had	to	stay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 traded	 his	 formal	 off-white	 uniform	 for	 a	 more	 practical	 pair	 of	 khakis and	a	tan	short	sleeve	shirt	with	his	Chief	stripes	sewn	on	the	sleeves.	He	even considered	 a	 pith	 helmet,	 like	 they	 wear	 in	 the	 tropics,	 but	 thought	 that	 would have	 been	 a	 little	 too	 much.	 Even	 without	 the	 helmet,	 the	 outfit	 made	 him	 feel like	an	explorer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	planetary	team	seated	themselves	while	the	captain	closed	the	doors	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">started	the	engines.	The	shuttle	floated	slowly	up	and	maneuvered	to	the	hangar bay	 door	 where	 a	 force	 field	 twinkled	 to	 life.	 The	 large	 outside	 door	 slowly opened	and	slid	up	out	of	the	way	to	reveal	black	space	and	bright	stars.	Without hesitation,	the	shuttle	smoothly	accelerated	through	the	opening,	circled	over	the <i class="calibre4">Excalibur</i>,	and	pointed	itself	at	Avalon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	captain	stopped	the	ship,	set	the	controls	to	stationary,	and	turned	to	the passenger	 compartment,	 “Al,	 I	 believe	 you	 have	 some	 rules	 you’d	 like	 to	 lay out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	addressed	the	group	seated	around	him.	“Everyone	is	aware	of	the	rules—</p>
<p class="calibre1">right?	We	go	everywhere	in	twos,	and	we	stay	close	to	camp.	If	you	need	to	go</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	 of	 sight	 of	 the	 shuttle,	 a	 security	 officer	 will	 accompany	 you.	 We	 keep	 our voices	 down—if	 you	 need	 to	 yell,	 you	 use	 the	 radios,	 and	 we	 don’t	 touch <i class="calibre4">anything</i>	without	gloves.	 Remember,	this	is	 only	a	preliminary	 survey.	We	will be	carefully	taking	samples	and	returning	them	to	the	ship	to	be	analyzed.	There is	no	need	to	take	unnecessary	risks.	Are	there	any	questions?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	no	questions.	It	was	evident	his	crewmates	wanted	to	get	going. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	captain	saw	there	was	no	reason	to	delay,	he	turned	his	attention	back to	the	controls	and	said,	“All	right	then—let’s	go	and	see	our	new	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>They	 descended	 to	 within	 a	 mile	 of	 the	 surface	 and	 directly	 over	 their designated	site.	The	craft	hovered	for	a	moment,	weightless	and	silent;	and	the passengers	held	their	breath	without	knowing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	captain	said,	“Here	we	go,”	and	they	dropped	like	a	rock	into	the	night</p>
<p class="calibre1">sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ride	down	was	a	blur	of	clouds	and	a	rush	of	air	that	shook	the	shuttle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 the	 shuttle	 fell	 to	 within	 a	 hundred	 feet	 of	 the	 ground,	 the	 captain gradually	added	power	until	they	came	to	a	stop;	floating	inches	off	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	ride	to	remember.	The	captain	knew	his	shuttle	and	its	capabilities.	He smiled	all	the	way	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	asked,	“Is	that	why	they	call	it	planetfall?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	captain	just	smiled.	He	parked	the	shuttle	under	a	large,	unusual	looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">tree	 at	 the	 edge	 of	 a	 forest	 of	 exotic	 timber.	 The	 group	 constructed	 a	 fold-up canopy	 of	 camouflage	 netting	 twice	 as	 large	 as	 the	 craft,	 with	 the	 extra	 space under	the	canopy	used	as	a	covert	base.	Out	of	sight	equals	out	of	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	unloading,	they	gathered	and	watched	the	sunrise.	Slowly,	as	the	sun</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	 up,	 their	 new	 world	 was	 revealed	 to	 them.	 The	 mountains	 were	 to	 their south,	 with	 a	 green	 and	 purple	 forest	 flowing	 up	 to	 them.	 To	 the	 north	 was	 a picturesque	 river,	 with	 spring	 thaws	 from	 the	 mountains	 adding	 to	 its	 girth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Green	rolling	hills	with	clumps	of	tiny	red	and	blue	flowers	stretched	all	the	way to	 the	 river	 bank.	 The	 name	 they	 picked	 was	 well	 chosen—it	 truly	 was	 an Avalonian	Shangri-La. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	not,	however,	fooled	by	its	beauty.	The	planet	appeared	similar	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Earth.	However,	all	they	had	to	do	was	look	around,	and	it	became	obvious	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 not	 on	 Earth.	 Evolution	 works	 differently	 according	 to	 different</p>
<p class="calibre1">requirements	 and	 has	 varying	 results.	 Every	 plant	 and	 every	 creature	 they	 saw would	be	an	entirely	new	species. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tables	 were	 set-up	 and	 various	 scientific	 equipment	 placed	 on	 top. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Afterwards,	 everyone	 helped	 to	 collect	 specimens	 and	 samples.	 They	 recorded the	 location	 of	 each	 item	 collected,	 along	 with	 any	 particulars,	 and	 then	 the specimens	and	samples	were	safely	packed	away	into	air-tight	cases.	It	was	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">beginning	of	a	long	busy	day,	but	nobody	complained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taken	 in	 by	 the	 landscape,	 and	 with	 little	 to	 do,	 the	 captain	 and	 Al	 took	 a stroll	down	to	the	river	around	mid-morning.	The	sky	was	clear,	and	the	air	was fresh.	If	not	for	the	alien	life	all	around	them,	it	might	have	been	a	perfect	spring morning	at	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	was	helping	Cody	to	store	the	sample	cases	when	the	captain	asked	if	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	like	to	take	a	walk.	Earlier,	Al	noticed	the	captain	surreptitiously	watching</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>him	several	times.	When	Al	would	turn	in	his	direction,	the	ship’s	captain	would look	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	 they	 walked,	 Al	 tried	 to	 find	 out	 why.	 “Is	 everything	 all	 right, Captain?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure...everything	is	fine.	How	about	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	all	right	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 captain	 stopped	 on	 the	 bank	 overlooking	 the	 river	 and	 took	 a	 deep breath;	 enjoying	 the	 view.	 Unexpectedly,	 he	 turned	 to	 Al	 and	 said,	 “I’ve	 been wanting	to	talk	to	you,	Mister	Clark.	Are	you	doing	all	right?	I	mean	with	your amnesia	and	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 question	 surprised	 Al.	 “Well...I	 still	 can’t	 remember	 anything	 that happened	before	I	woke	up	in	the	pod,	but	I’m	doing	fine	otherwise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	doesn’t	appear	to	affect	your	duties,”	the	captain	pointed	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	no	sir,	I	seem	to	remember	a	lot	of	things...just	not	about	me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	must	be	terrible.	Would	you	like	to	know	more	about	yourself?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very	much	sir.	I	don’t	let	it	eat	at	me.	Although	it	does	concern	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	captain	looked	down	at	his	feet	and	then	raised	his	head	to	look	Al	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes,	“I’m	hoping	it	will	come	back	to	you.	Everyone	should	know	their	past.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	nodded	and	replied,	“It	would	sure	be	nice	to	know	my	real	name,	even	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	can’t	remember	the	rest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 river,	 something	 surfaced,	 splashed,	 and	 slipped	 back underwater.	Al	and	the	captain	stood	on	the	bank,	watching	the	river	to	see	if	it happened	 again.	 Later,	 Al	 would	 wonder	 if	 maybe	 the	 captain	 knew	 more	 than he	was	saying. </p><p class="calibre1">

THE	 SUN	 BEGAN	 TO	 SET,	 and	 the	 explorers	 retreated	 to	 their	 shelter.	 They paused	from	their	efforts	long	enough	to	watch	the	sun	go	down.	It	was	a	sunset to	rival	many	of	Earth’s	end	of	day	spectacles,	and	it	made	more	than	a	few	of<p class="calibre1"/>

<p class="calibre1">all	 the	 information	 they	 could	 before	 they	 packed	 up	 and	 left;	 just	 after	 sunset the	following	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Earlier	in	the	day,	Doctor	Cody	and	the	biologist,	Dr.	Nestling,	found	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">animal	tracks	in	the	mud	by	the	river.	There	were	tracks	all	over,	but	these	stood out	because	they	were	eight	inches	long,	with	three	long	claws	in	the	front	and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>one	 in	 the	 back.	 They	 found	 only	 find	 two	 prints	 in	 the	 mud—as	 if	 it	 had appeared,	and	then	suddenly	disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	 of	 the	 group	 were	 crowded	 around	 a	 terminal,	 puzzling	 over	 the	 3D</p>
<p class="calibre1">images	 Cody	 and	 the	 doctor	 recorded	 using	 a	 data	 pad.	 The	 monitor	 allowed them	a	larger	view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks	like	a	big	chicken	to	me,”	one	of	Al’s	men	suggested	with	a	wink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 chicken	 stands	 five	 or	 six	 feet	 tall,	 and	 could	 very	 possibly	 be dangerous,”	the	biologist	retorted.	“We	should	be	careful.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 captain	 warned	 everyone	 to	 keep	 their	 eyes	 open	 and	 report	 anything unusual,	or	that	might	be	dangerous.	“Do	not	forget—this	is	not	Earth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	team	ate	when	they	could.	Some	managed	to	get	a	few	hours’	sleep.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">sounds	 of	 the	 forest	 and	 the	 river	 permeated	 the	 air,	 and	 in	 the	 distance,	 they heard	 an	 occasional	 unearthly	 howl.	 As	 the	 night	 wore	 on,	 they	 became increasingly	aware	of	how	vulnerable	they	were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	and	his	men	were	up	the	whole	night	watching	the	camp	perimeter—for</p>
<p class="calibre1">big	chickens—or	anything	else	that	might	cause	a	threat.	He	and	his	men	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">armed	 with	 MLP	 handguns,	 and	 the	 shuttle	 held	 three	 laser	 rifles	 capable	 of taking	out	a	bear	at	three-hundred	yards.	Al	was	not	taking	any	chances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	morning,	they	were	too	busy	to	watch	the	sunrise.	There	were	bugs	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">collect,	soil	samples	to	get,	and	3D	images	to	record.	The	camp	was	abuzz	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">activity	as	they	attempted	to	accomplish	all	that	was	needed	before	they	left.	At daylight,	most	of	the	team	left	camp	to	go	out	and	finish	their	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 the	 base	 of	 a	 tree	 nearby,	 a	 security	 officer	 and	 the	 town	 planner discovered	 a	 basket.	 It	 was	 a	 primitive,	 hand-woven	 container	 fashioned	 from reeds	collected	by	the	river,	and	it	overflowed	with	colorful	fruit.	They	found	it early	 on	 their	 way	 to	 document	 habitat	 locations	 and	 immediately	 brought	 it back	to	camp.	When	they	returned,	the	co-pilot	was	the	only	one	left	at	camp.	He asked,	“Where	did	you	find	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 security	 officer	 pointed.	 “Right	 there...Not	 a	 hundred	 feet	 from	 us.	 We had	 three	 security	 men	 on	 watch	 all	 night,	 and	 they	 still	 managed	 to	 get	 that close	without	being	seen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	co-pilot	confirmed	their	fears.	“Well...so	much	for	our	being	discreet.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">looks	like	somebody	knows	we're	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	called	the	security	chief	and	informed	Al	of	the	find. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	found	a	what?	Where?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	basket	sir...at	the	base	of	a	tree	about	a	hundred	feet	from	camp.	I	don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">know	how	they	did	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 was	 helping	 to	 collect	 water	 samples	 from	 the	 riverbank,	 and	 this	 news was	unsettling. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>His	officer	said,	“It’s	a	basket	full	of	fruit	sir—a	fruit	basket—I	think	it’s	a gift,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	mean	like	welcome	to	the	neighborhood?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	afraid	so,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The	 captain	 is	 not	 going	 to	 like	 this, </i> thought	 Al.  <i class="calibre4">	 The	 presence	 of	 natives</i> <i class="calibre4">nearby	will	complicate	things</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 the	 captain	 heard	 about	 the	 appearance	 of	 the	 basket,	 he	 was	 not pleased,	 although,	 he	 took	 it	 better	 than	 anticipated.	 It	 was	 inevitable	 that	 first contact	would	happen	sooner,	rather	than	later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll	 finish	 our	 mission	 as	 planned	 and	 leave	 as	 soon	 as	 it	 gets	 dark enough.	Make	sure	that	everyone	is	aware	and	ready.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	captain	explained	his	thinking	by	saying,	“This	is	our	new	home.	Like	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	not,	we’ll	have	to	learn	to	live	with	whoever	is	here.	We	have	nowhere	else	to go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	the	samples	and	specimens	were	safely	packed	away	onto	the	shuttle,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">everyone	 on	 board	 was	 talking	 about	 the	 basket	 and	 the	 many	 things	 they	 had learned	 on	 Avalon.	 Al	 was	 in	 the	 back	 seat	 watching	 the	 forest	 as	 the	 shuttle lifted	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	gloom,	standing	in	the	shadow	of	the	woods,	a	silhouette	of	something</p>
<p class="calibre1">taller	than	six	feet	was	watching.	It	appeared	their	departure	was	being	observed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a><img src="index-74_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Eleven</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	shuttle	bay	was	full	again	as	the	first	humans	on	Avalon	returned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	had	a	thousand	questions,	so	the	captain	held	up	his	hands	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">got	the	crowd	to	settle	down	long	enough	to	say,	“Initial	findings	of	our	primary site	are	promising,	and	it	appears	suitable	to	our	needs.	It	is	not	quite	as	secluded as	we	had	hoped.	It	seems	the	planet	is	inhabited,	and	we	have	neighbors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	mission...is	a	success,	and	we	will	post	all	our	results	on	the	shipboard</p>
<p class="calibre1">net.	Habitat	modules	will	begin	going	down	starting	next	week,	followed	shortly by	personnel.”	With	a	broad	smile,	he	added,	“Welcome	home	everyone!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	returning	team	left	the	shuttle	bay	the	same	way	they	came—with	cheers</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 whistles.	 The	 attention	 was	 nice.	 However,	 what	 they	 wanted	 most	 was	 to get	cleaned	up,	get	something	to	eat,	and	to	rest.	All	the	way	through	the	hiber-pod	 bay,	 the	 medical	 bay,	 the	 park,	 the	 farm,	 and	 on	 to	 the	 habitat	 ring,	 they answered	 questions.	 The	 group	 responded	 when	 they	 could	 but	 politely	 kept moving.	They	had	begun	a	new	branch	of	human	history,	and	it	left	them	excited</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	tired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 was	 not	 too	 tired	 for	 a	 welcome	 home	 party.	 The	 doctor	 declared	 he couldn’t	keep	his	eyes	open,	so	he	went	home	to	get	some	sleep.	Al	and	the	rest of	 his	 friends	 gathered	 at	 Ana	 and	 Kayla’s	 to	 celebrate	 their	 return.	 Of	 course, his	friends	also	had	questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	fruit	basket...really?”	asked	Ana. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	 nice	 one,	 with	 shiny,	 colorful	 fruit	 in	 a	 hand-made	 basket;	 of	 reeds	 no less.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	think	it	means?”	Liz	wanted	to	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Somebody	wants	to	make	friends?”	offered	Al. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris,	 looking	 thoughtful,	 said,	 “It	 sounds	 like	 the	 Avalonians	 are	 pretty primitive.	Do	you	think	it	might	be	a	tribute?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	want	to	speculate—let’s	call	it	a	basket	of	fruit	for	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	the	water	drinkable?”	inquired	Kayla. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tests	so	far	are	good.	We	will	have	to	wait	until	the	rest	of	the	analysis	are completed	to	determine	if	treatment	might	be	necessary	to	make	it	safe.	I	am	told it	looks	good	so	far.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	the	trees	like?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>The	discussions	went	on	till	late	in	the	evening.	Al	answered	their	questions as	 best	 he	 could	 and	 told	 them	 what	 he	 knew	 of	 Avalon.	 They	 speculated	 on	 a dozen	 subjects,	 explained	 their	 personal	 theories,	 and	 laughed	 at	 each	 other’s jokes.	Al	could	have	talked	about	Shangri-La	and	their	trip	all	night.	Eventually, someone	said	something	about	getting	up	in	the	morning	and	yawning,	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">party	reluctantly	came	to	an	end.	Al	left	to	get	himself	some	well-deserved	rest. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
THE	 SECURITY	 CHIEF	 asked	 for	 and	 received	 permission	 to	 deploy	 two<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">autonomous	drones	called	 <i class="calibre4">Watchers</i>	 at	 his	 earliest	 opportunity.	 Whoever	 it	 was that	left	the	basket	needed	to	be	watched	in	return.	As	head	of	security,	he	was responsible	 for	 the	 safety	 of	 all	 the	 personnel	 sent	 down	 to	 establish	 their community,	and	he	wanted	to	use	all	the	tools	available. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 needed	 an	 early	 warning	 system	 and	 found	 just	 what	 he	 required</p>
<p class="calibre1">underneath	the	floor	in	the	security	section.	He	knew	what	they	were	before	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">even	opened	the	box.	He	opened	one	and	removed	the	baseball	sized	drone	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">included	technology	that	rendered	them	effectively	invisible.	They	could	float	in a	tree	or	circle	a	specified	area	at	five-hundred	feet	silent	and	unseen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 watchers	 were	 typically	 programmed	 to	 operate	 at	 a	 specified	 range from	 a	 center	 point.	 They	 could	 operate	 twenty-four-seven	 and	 had	 a	 three-hundred	and	sixty-degree	field	of	view.	If	it	detected	unusual	movement,	heat	or sound,	 it	 would	 move	 closer	 to	 investigate	 and	 transmit	 images	 to	 a	 security device	along	with	an	alarm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 had	 to	 test	 them	 and	 surprised	 his	 officers	 more	 than	 once	 with	 his surveillance	 techniques	 in	 the	 days	 before	 departure.	 He	 would	 program	 the watcher	 to	 target	 a	 particular	 individual,	 and	 it	 would	 follow	 discreetly	 behind them;	oblivious	to	the	fact	they	were	being	observed.	When	a	disembodied	voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	behind	would	tell	them	to	pick	the	mashed	potatoes	over	the	green	beans	in the	mess	hall,	Al	found	the	expressions	on	their	faces	hilarious.	They,	however, disagreed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 return	 to	 Avalon	 involved	 two	 shuttles.	 The	 captain	 decided	 he	 didn’t want	to	risk	more	than	two	with	only	four	shuttles	left	after	the	meteoroid	strike through	the	shuttle	bay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Planetfall	 was	 as	 before,	 with	 the	 ships	 falling	 through	 the	 clouds	 before dawn	to	land	by	the	forest.	One	ship	would	carry	the	first	four	habitat	modules. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 habitat	 module	 consisted	 of	 a	 six	 by	 six	 cube	 that	 self-deployed	 into	 a twenty-four	 by	 twenty-four-foot	 self-contained	 habitat.	 The	 cubes	 could	 be stacked	 or	 added	 end	 to	 end	 to	 construct	 whatever	 dwelling	 was	 required.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a>modules	 were	 multi-purpose,	 versatile	 shelters	 that	 would	 serve	 as	 temporary quarters	until	more	permanent	buildings	were	built. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 board	 the	 second	 shuttle	 was:	 Al,	 two	 security	 officers,	 Elizabeth,	 the town	planner,	and	a	crew	of	specialists	on	habitat	construction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon	arrival,	Al	left	one	security	officer	to	patrol	the	grounds	and	took	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	 to	 help	 deploy	 the	 two	 watchers.	 They	 programmed	 them	 to	 stay	 one-hundred	 and	 eighty	 degrees	 apart,	 and	 circle	 the	 perimeter	 of	 the	 construction site	at	an	altitude	of	one-hundred	feet.	If	a	threat	occurred,	an	alarm	is	sent	to	all the	officer’s	security	pads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	issued	specialized	security	devices	to	each	officer	the	day	they	joined	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">team.	 The	 pads	 were	 small	 enough	 to	 fit	 in	 a	 pocket,	 and	 multi-purpose,	 with functions	tailored	for	surveillance	and	communication. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 watcher	 alarm	 includes	 live	 video,	 audio,	 and	 details	 such	 as	 distance, size,	temperature,	and	speed.	Al	felt	better	once	they	were	deployed.	Now	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	know	if	anything	tried	to	sneak	up	on	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	tested	the	response	of	each	watcher	and	then	Al	sent	his	officer	back	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">help	with	the	unloading.	He	decided	to	assist	Elizabeth	to	install	the	satellite	dish they	 would	 need	 to	 boost	 communication	 with	 the	 ship	 in	 orbit.	 She	 was	 busy unpacking	when	he	arrived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	asked,	knowing	she	was	fluent	in	anything	electronic,	“Got	any	idea	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re	doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	answer	was	quick,	“Well...I	think	this	thing	gets	connected	to	that	thing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	then	you	add	this	little	spiral	thingy	to	the	side	of	that	thing,	um...Add	a	few wires	and	bingo;	you	have	instant	communication	with	a	spaceship	in	orbit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	that’s	how	it	works.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz	 admitted,	 “It	 may	 be	 a	 little	 more	 complicated	 than	 that.	 I	 forgot	 to mention	all	the	computer	jargon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 chuckled	 and	 asked,	 “Need	 some	 help	 putting	 the	 things	 together?	 I	 can help	with	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure—grab	 that	 box	 and	 follow	 me.	 We	 have	 to	 find	 an	 out-of-the-way clearing	where	we	can	do	the	install.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	satellite	needed	a	direct	line	of	sight	to	the	ship,	and	an	elevated	position to	protect	it	from	animals	and	signal	blockage.	They	found	a	spot	just	inside	the camp	perimeter,	far	from	the	people	constructing	the	habitats.	Before	they	could begin	 to	 unpack,	 Al	 received	 an	 alarm.	 Something	 triggered	 one	 of	 the surveillance	drones,	and	the	device	in	his	pocket	was	screaming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 intruders	 also	 heard	 the	 alarm	 and	 ducked	 for	 cover.	 Al	 took	 his	 pad from	his	pocket	and	opened	it	to	see	what	the	watcher	saw.	A	hundred	feet	away</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a>were	 two	 ‘people,’	 hiding	 in	 the	 forest	 behind	 some	 bushes.	 The	 silent	 drone floated	directly	above	them;	invisible	and	unnoticed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	radio	squawked	to	life,	“Come	in	Chief	Clark.	We	just	got	an	alarm,	sir, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	it	appears	you	have	company.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	officers	in	the	camp	saw	the	same	information	he	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 whispered	 to	 the	 device,	 “I	 have	 the	 alarm.	 Maintain	 your	 positions.	 I’ll call	if	I	need	help.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	did	not	need	a	lot	of	people	rushing	to	their	rescue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elizabeth	whispered,	“What	do	we	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	sure.	What’s	the	protocol	for	first	contact?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	are	not	ready	for	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	grimaced,	“I	don’t	think	we	can	wait	until	it’s	convenient.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“First	 contact	 has	 to	 be	 done	 very	 carefully,	 by	 trained	 people.	 In	 other words,	 anything	 you	 say	 can	 be	 taken	 wrong	 and	 sometimes	 with	 dangerous results—maybe	we	can	sneak	away?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don’t	 believe	 that’s	 wise.	 I’m	 pretty	 sure	 they	 saw	 us—as	 well	 as	 heard us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right	Al,	but	we	can’t	say	anything	more	than	we	have	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Together	they	stood	up,	walked	to	within	twenty	feet	of	the	bushes	where	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">others	 were	 hiding,	 and	 waited	 until	 the	 natives	 acknowledged	 them.	 Al	 could only	take	it	for	a	minute	or	two	before	he	finally	said,	“Hello...you	can	come	out now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	heard	a	short,	subdued	conversation	in	another	language	coming	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 bushes,	 and	 two	 heads	 slowly	 poked	 above	 the	 greenery.	 Hesitantly,	 they stood	up	and	came	from	behind	the	bushes,	and	immediately	fell	to	their	knees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	 fruit	 dropped	 from	 the	 baskets	 they	 were	 carrying	 which	 they	 hurriedly replaced.	They	were	obviously	scared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	held	up	his	hands	in	what	he	hoped	was	a	universal	gesture	of	friendship, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	they	cowered	even	more.	They	were	not	just	scared;	they	were	terrified.	Al</p>
<p class="calibre1">knelt	beside	them	and	motioned	for	them	to	stand	up.	They	grabbed	the	baskets</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	stood,	holding	the	offerings	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 were	 clearly	 humanoid	 and	 young.	 A	 little	 short	 by	 human	 standards, with	 the	 tallest	 one	 standing	 only	 about	 five-six,	 and	 the	 other	 a	 little	 shorter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 had	 long	 dark	 hair	 and	 dark	 eyes,	 were	 dressed	 in	 skins	 and	 furs,	 and carried	pointed	spears.	The	tall	one	had	a	belt	over	one	shoulder	fashioned	from something	resembling	alligator	skin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 became	 apparent	 the	 taller	 one	 with	 the	 beard,	 was	 male,	 and	 the	 other female.	If	the	two	aliens	were	cleaned	up,	they	could	easily	pass	for	humans. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>Elizabeth	and	Al	had	a	short	discussion	and	decided	it	is	only	proper	to	trade a	gift	for	a	gift,	so	Al	asked	if	she	had	anything	to	trade	in	her	pack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	do	have	some	chocolate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 couldn’t	 help	 himself.	 “Does	 every	 woman	 carry	 spare	 chocolate	 with them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Umm...sometimes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	just	kidding.	Chocolate	is	perfect	for	this	situation.	Let’s	trade.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 each	 accepted	 a	 basket	 and	 Liz,	 in	 turn,	 handed	 each	 of	 the	 natives	 a bar	of	chocolate	and	pantomimed	eating	them.	Their	faces	lit	up,	and	they	went</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	down	on	their	knees.	The	two	humans	just	shook	their	heads.	This	was	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">how	they	had	imagined	first	contact	would	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 thought	 it	 necessary	 they	 find	 out	 where	 the	 two	 lived.	 The	 natives watched	spellbound	as	he	knelt	down	and	drew	a	rough	plan	of	the	valley	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dirt	and	explained	his	makeshift	map. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 is	 the	 forest.	 Over	 here	 is	 the	 river.	 Up	 there	 is	 the	 mountain.”	 He pointed	to	them	and	then	the	map	and	asked,	“Where	do	you	come	from?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 the	 aliens	 figured	 out	 what	 Al	 was	 trying	 to	 ask,	 they	 pointed	 at	 a lower	portion	of	the	mountain	while	shaking	their	heads	up	and	down.	It	seemed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	gesture	for	yes <i class="calibre4">	was</i>	universal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 would	 explain	 how	 they	 knew	 we	 were	 in	 their	 valley,	 Liz.	 From where	they	live,	regardless	of	our	precautions—they	saw	us	coming.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	do	you	say	to	two	strangers	from	another	world	that	can’t	understand	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">single	word	you	say?	You	stand	around	smiling	and	nodding	your	head—a	lot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 knew	 there	 were	 experts	 on	 board	  <i class="calibre4">Excalibur</i>	 that	 would	 know	 just	 what	 to say.	They	were	people	trained	for	this	kind	of	thing	and	spent	most	of	their	lives dreaming	about	it.	 Al	also	recognized	 that	first	contact,	 done	incorrectly,	could result	in	all	sorts	of	accidental	damage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	pointed	at	the	natives,	then	the	spot	where	they	said	they	came	from,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">told	 them	 with	 a	 big	 smile,	 “Go	 home...you...go	 home.”	 Liz	 followed	 his example,	 and	 eventually,	 the	 two	 young	 natives	 started	 bowing	 and	 slowly walking	backward.	The	humans	smiled	and	nodded	their	heads	until	the	natives</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 perhaps	 thirty	 feet	 away,	 at	 which	 point	 the	 first	 alien	 race	 ever	 seen	 by humankind	turned	and	raced	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 and	 Liz	 watched	 them	 until	 they	 were	 out	 of	 sight,	 shook	 their	 heads	 a few	times,	and	immediately	returned	to	installing	the	satellite	dish.	They	needed to	 call	 the	 ship	 as	 soon	 as	 possible.	 The	 captain	 needed	 to	 know	 about	 this impromptu	meeting. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>

<a id="p80"></a>KIRA	THE	GIRL,	AND	Toji,	the	guy	with	the	beard—ran.	They	were	good	at flight;	having	learned	to	run	not	long	after	they	could	walk.	It	was	already	late	in the	 day,	 and	 they	 had	 to	 be	  <i class="calibre4">Home</i>	 before	 dark.	 However,	 there	 were	 daylight dangers	in	the	woods,	so	they	slowed	a	little	as	soon	as	the	star	gods	were	left	far enough	behind. <p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">From	the	time	they	were	little,	they	were	taught	to	move	swiftly	and	silently</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	the	forest.	On	this	occasion,	the	two	young	natives	excitement	overrode their	 training,	 and	 they	 couldn’t	 stop	 whispering.	 Their	 first	 meeting	 with	 the Kuthra	had	gone	well,	and	they	were	coming	back	with	gifts.	The	elders	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	pleased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kira	and	Toji	were	specially	picked	to	deliver	the	tribute	due	to	their	skills	in the	 woods	 and	 were	 only	 expected	 to	 drop	 the	 baskets	 nearby	 and	 quietly	 slip away.	 The	 fact	 that	 they	 actually	 spoke	 to	 a	 Kuthra	 was	 beyond	 their	 wildest dreams. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	  <i class="calibre4">Sansi</i>	 tribe	 watched	 the	 humans	 arrive	 and	 depart	 on	 their	 first	 visit	 in their	 remarkable	 flying	 machines.	 When	 the	 gods	 returned,	 the	 elders	 were convinced	 <i class="calibre4">The	Prophecy</i>	was	coming	true;	where	mighty	gods	came	down	from the	star	in	the	sky	to	help	defeat	the	‘Riktors.'	The	prodigal	saviors	were	coming to	help	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kira	and	Toji	scrambled	up	the	path	leading	to	their	caves	on	light	feet	as	the sun	was	setting,	and	so	engrossed	in	their	discussion	that	they	almost	ran	into	the crowd	awaiting	their	return.	The	tribe	hurried	them	into	the	main	cave	entrance and	 blocked	 it	 off	 with	 large,	 heavy	 boulders.	 They	 no	 longer	 left	 it	 open	 and posted	guards,	as	posting	guards	outside—at	night—usually	ended	badly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 mountain	 was	 naturally	 riddled	 with	 caves,	 and	 this	 section	 was	 the indigenous	people’s	homes.	Over	time,	they	systematically	blocked	all	but	a	few entrances	and	made	the	mountain	a	safe	place	to	live.	In	the	past,	hundreds	lived here.	Now,	they	were	down	to	a	few	dozen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 called	 themselves	 Sansi.	 Every	 person	 on	 Tiera—the	 native	 name	 for Avalon—were	Sansi.	Except	for	the	Kuthra,	of	course,	who	came	from	the	star</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	no	wars	between	Sansi	for	they	were	all	too	busy	hiding	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Riktors.	 The	 beasts	 would	 suddenly	 appear	 and	 take	 their	 children,	 or	 kill	 the adults,	 and	 then	 take	 their	 children.	 They	 were	 the	 creatures	 that	 came	 in	 the night	and	a	part	of	the	natives’	nightmares. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Sansi	elders	watched	the	star	that	brought	the	gods	for	many	cycles,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 elders	 had	 predicted	 that	 one	 day	 they	 would	 come	 to	 save	 the	 Sansi.	 The natives	could	not	go	outside	to	see	the	star	at	night,	but	it	could	be	seen	moving</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>across	the	sky	through	small	holes	in	the	upper	part	of	their	cave.	It	was	a	special star,	and	many	prayers	had	been	addressed	to	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kira	 and	 Toji’s	 friends	 and	 relatives	 surrounded	 the	 two	 tribute	 deliverers, and	when	they	were	safe	inside,	they	brought	out	the	chocolate	that	the	Kuthra</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	 senior	 before	 them	 accepted	 one	 of	 the	 chocolate	 bars	 and	 carefully opened	the	wrapper.	He	smelled	it,	broke	off	a	tiny	piece,	and	with	a	wince,	put it	into	his	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	face	transformed	into	one	of	delight,	and	he	proclaimed,	“It	is	the	food	of the	Gods!”	The	Sansi	cheered. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Establishment	 of	 the	 human	 camp	 progressed	 well	 the	 first	 day.	 By</p>
<p class="calibre1">nightfall,	 they	 completed	 the	 construction	 of	 one	 habitat.	 There	 was	 no water	in	the	shelter,	and	the	solar	cells	had	not	had	time	to	charge,	but	the	simple building	was	ready	for	use. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 communication	 dish	 was	 operational,	 and	 Al	 and	 Liz	 were	 using	 it	 to inform	 the	 captain	 of	 their	 meeting	 with	 the	 two	 natives.	 He	 listened	 to	 their story	and	had	a	few	direct	questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	gave	them	chocolate?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 admitted,	 “Umm...yes	 sir.	 I	 didn’t	 think	 it	 would	 hurt,	 and	 they	 brought gifts	for	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	captain	continued,	“What	else	did	you	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	wasn’t	a	whole	lot	we	could	do.	We	sent	them	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	they	tell	you	where	that	is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes	sir,	they	pointed	it	out	to	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.	In	the	morning,	send	one	of	your	watchers	to	find	them,	and	maybe</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	an	idea	as	to	how	many	there	are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will	do	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	do	realize	you’ve	probably	ruined	their	diet	and	more	than	likely	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">teeth?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 going	 to	 send	 a	 contact	 specialist	 down	 on	 the	 next	 trip.	 She	 should arrive	 by	 tomorrow	 afternoon.	 Hey,	 while	 you’re	 at	 it,	 send	 Liz	 back	 with	 the shuttle.	We	need	her	here	to	help	wind	the	ship	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	your	command...sir,”	Al	said	with	a	grin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	was	that?	The	radio	has	some	static.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Never	mind	sir.	Liz	will	be	on	the	shuttle	in	the	morning.	Al	looked	at	her, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	she	raised	both	palms	in	a	sign	of	submission. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	 talk	 to	 you	 again	 tomorrow.	 Good	 night	 sir.”	 Al	 signed	 off	 thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">That	 could	 probably	 have	 gone	 better. </i>	 When	 he	 told	 Elizabeth	 what	 he	 was thinking,	she	laughed	and	agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later	that	evening	they	joined	the	rest	of	the	colonists	at	a	long	table	set	up for	 dinner.	 The	 scientists,	 the	 habitat	 specialists,	 security,	 and	 pilots	 were	 all</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a>colonists	now.	One	large	family	sitting	down	to	dinner	after	dark.	Lantern	light helped	set	a	relaxed	mood	and	kindled	conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 were	 discussing	 the	 abundance	 of	 lizards.	 Avalon	 appeared	 to	 have	 a large	population	of	all	kinds	of	reptiles.	There	were	some	seen	on	the	first	trip, but	 now	 they	 seemed	 to	 be	 all	 over	 the	 woods.	 They	 were	 mostly	 small	 four-legged	lizards,	except	one	person	reported	one	almost	a	foot	long.	Al	listened	to the	discussion	and	began	to	get	concerned.	“Have	you	found	any	in	camp?”	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">inquired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	 seem	 to	 prefer	 the	 woods.	 I	 haven’t	 seen	 any	 in	 the	 open,”	 someone volunteered.	Several	others	agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Has	anyone	been	bitten?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	looked	around.	None	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	had	a	warning	for	them,	“Well,	you	might	want	to	avoid	that.	It	is	possible</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	some	of	them	may	be	poisonous.	Everyone	should	avoid	them	until	we	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">learn	more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 Excalibur	 held	 powered	 sonic	 security	 fences	 designed	 to	 close	 off	 an area	from	mouse-sized	animals	to	man-sized	animals.	To	be	on	the	safe	side,	Al</p>
<p class="calibre1">decided	that	those	fences	would	also	be	on	the	shuttle	when	it	returned	to	camp tomorrow	afternoon.	Al	told	himself,  <i class="calibre4">better	safe	than	sorry. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	just	about	then	an	alarm	went	off.	The	security	chief	almost	dropped</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	pad	getting	it	out	of	his	pocket.	The	device	displayed	a	video	of	something big,	moving	fast	in	their	direction.	It	came	out	of	the	west,	with	the	watcher	right behind	it.	Al	could	see	the	creatures	back	moving	side	to	side	as	it	sped	through the	woods,	rushing	right	towards	them.	The	creature	was	at	least	eight	feet	tall, and	fast;	moving	at	thirty-seven	miles	per	hour	and	not	slowing	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 was	 unsnapping	 his	 weapon	 and	 preparing	 to	 yell	 orders	 when	 a	 second alarm	 pierced	 the	 night	 air.	 There	 was	 another	 one	 coming	 from	 the	 opposite direction,	about	the	same	size,	and	advancing	at	a	similar	ground	eating	speed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	two	places	he	could	send	people	to	safety;	the	nearest	shuttle	parked</p>
<p class="calibre1">sixty	 feet	 away	 or	 the	 habitat	 sitting	 ten	 feet	 closer.	 He	 told	 his	 two	 officers	 to head	towards	the	last	alarm	and	everybody	else	to	head	for	the	habitat.	He	hoped ten	feet	would	make	the	difference. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	rifles	were	locked	up	in	the	farthest	shuttle	and	too	far	away	to	help.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	a	mistake	Al	would	regret. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	ran	from	the	canopy	and	headed	west	towards	the	habitat	modules	stored</p>
<p class="calibre1">there.	The	cubes	were	placed	out	near	the	perimeter	to	get	them	out	of	the	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">until	 needed,	 so	 Al	 had	 to	 cover	 a	 lot	 of	 ground	 in	 a	 hurry.	 He	 wouldn’t	 have guessed	 he	 could	 run	 that	 fast,	 but	 Al	 did,	 and	 he	 made	 it	 to	 the	 farthest	 cube quicker	than	he	would	have	thought	possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>The	monitor	indicated	it	was	close.	He	took	a	breath	and	looked	around	the side	of	the	cube	to	see	a	ten-foot	beast,	in	full	predator	mode,	as	it	burst	from	the trees	and	ran	straight	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 a	 dinosaur.	 The	 history	 book	 kind	 with	 an	 enormous	 mouth,	 long pointed	 teeth,	 and	 strong	 hind	 legs	 that	 tore	 up	 the	 ground	 the	 creature	 left behind.	 A	 twelve-inch	 horn	 poked	 from	 its	 head,	 and	 it	 was	 thundering	 toward him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pointed	his	weapon	and	started	firing.	The	MLP	could	recharge	itself	fast</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	many	shots	before	a	full	recharge	was	needed	because	it	was	a	small	laser.	It was	not	designed	for	distance	and	only	made	small	holes.	It	wasn’t	helping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 monster	 hit	 the	 cube	 head-on,	 impaling	 it	 on	 its	 horn,	 and	 driving	 it backward	 with	 Al	 sliding	 behind	 it.	 It	 then	 picked	 up	 the	 six-by-six,	 one thousand	 pound	 habitat,	 and	 threw	 it	 to	 the	 side;	 which	 left	 Al	 standing	 in	 the open	and	in	shock.	When	it	reared	up	and	roared,	Al	ran	for	his	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	made	it	to	the	shuttle	with	the	rifles,	thinking	he	might	be	able	to	get	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 more	 powerful	 lasers.	 Unfortunately,	 there	 was	 no	 time.	 He	 turned	 and started	firing	at	the	creatures	head.	It	was	his	only	chance.	If	he	didn’t	kill	it,	it was	going	to	kill	him,	and	he	wasn’t	done	living	yet.	After	the	fifth	or	sixth	shot, it	realized	its	mistake	and	tried	to	turn	away,	but	it	was	too	late	for	the	already dying	 animal.	 The	 beast	 staggered,	 fell,	 and	 slid	 sideways	 to	 bounce	 off	 the shuttle;	landing	in	a	dusty	heap	next	to	Al. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Across	the	camp,	someone	was	screaming.	The	monitor	on	his	pad	showed</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	 of	 his	 men	 standing	 frozen	 in	 front	 of	 the	 second	 creature,	 and	 he	 realized the	man	was	in	serious	trouble.	Al	raced	to	the	opposite	side	of	camp,	past	the other	shuttle,	past	the	canopy,	and	to	the	completed	habitat;	to	try	and	help.	He would	be	seconds	too	late. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 monster	 was	 already	 where	 the	 humans	 were	 hiding	 and	 ripping	 long jagged	creases	in	the	shelter	with	its	horn	and	long	talons.	He	could	hear	people screaming	 inside.	 One	 of	 his	 men	 was	 firing	 at	 it	 from	 a	 nearby	 construction machine,	 behind	 the	 creature,	 and	 the	 other	 man	 was	 lying	 by	 the	 beast	 in	 two bloody	pieces.	He	needed	to	end	this	quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	joined	the	man	firing	and	told	him,	“Get	ready,	and	aim	for	the	head!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	knew	that	the	creature	had	to	be	facing	them	and	close,	for	the	pistols	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	effective,	so	he	jumped	up	and	down	and	yelled,	“Here	we	are.	Come	and	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	creature	turned,	roared,	and	turned	to	comply.	It	died	before	it	realized</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	was	happening	and	with	a	final	scream	fell	hard	at	its	victor’s	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 conflict	 was	 over	 for	 now.	 Within	 a	 matter	 of	 minutes,	 they	 had	 killed two	dinosaurs	and	lost	one	of	their	own.	It	was	a	hefty	price	indeed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>****</p>
<p class="calibre1">WHEN	THE	DUST	SETTLED,	the	first	thing	that	Al	did	was	retrieve	the	rifles</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	shuttle.	He	was	going	to	keep	them	closer	from	now	on	and	would	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">underestimate	the	inherent	dangers	of	the	planet	again.	This	event	would	change their	whole	perspective	of	life	on	Avalon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	three	rifles	in	the	shuttle.	Al	and	his	remaining	officer	each	took</p>
<p class="calibre1">one,	and	the	third	he	gave	to	one	of	the	habitat	specialists	trained	in	its	operation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 crowded	 around	 a	 portable	 lantern	 placed	 on	 a	 small	 table	 inside	 the banged	 up	 habitat,	 and	 discussed	 what	 had	 happened.	 The	 body	 of	 the	 security officer	was	brought	back	to	camp	while	the	two	dead	beasts	were	left	where	they fell	until	morning.	The	attack	convinced	Al	it	was	too	dangerous	to	be	out	after dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elizabeth	was	upset,	as	they	all	were.	“That	poor	man	didn’t	stand	a	chance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	added,	“Why	haven’t	we	seen	any	sign	of	these	things	before	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 did	 find	 those	 footprints	 by	 the	 river...although	 they	 were	 smaller.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suggested	the	town	planner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 security	 officer	 that	 survived	 the	 attack	 was	 still	 in	 shock.	 “It	 took	 out Rudy	like	he	was	a	doll.	We	kept	firing	at	it,	and	it	just	kept	coming.	Who	would have	thought	we’d	be	attacked	by	dinosaurs,	and	that	they	would	be	so	freaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">fast.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	agreed,	“They	did	look	like	dinosaurs—didn’t	they?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 town	 planner	 had	 been	 thinking	 and	 asked,	 “Did	 anyone	 notice	 the lizards?	 There	 must	 have	 been	 a	 dozen	 lizards	 running	 behind	 each	 of	 those creatures.	Why	would	they	do	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	thought	they	were	probably	there	for	the	left-overs,	but	he	didn’t	verbalize it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz	 gave	 Al	 a	 puzzled	 look	 and	 asked,	 “How	 did	 you	 make	 it	 all	 the	 way back	from	the	other	side	of	camp	so	fast?	One	minute	I	heard	you	firing	out	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	cubes	and	the	next	you	were	here	saving	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know...it	all	happened	so	fast...I	didn’t	have	time	to	think.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	more	than	likely	saved	us	all,”	she	said,	and	then	quickly	realized	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">statement	was	not	quite	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	all	of	us,”	Al	reminded	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	didn’t	feel	like	talking,	especially	about	himself.	He	had	lost	one	of	those he	was	responsible	for,	and	he	would	be	obligated	to	speak	at	his	wake.	As	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">commanding	officer,	Al	probably	knew	him	better	than	most.	Rudy	was	not	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	fellow	officer;	he	was	a	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>Al	recommended	the	colonists	pull	back	and	regroup.	They	needed	to	rethink their	whole	settlement	idea.	If	they	were	going	to	find	a	place	on	this	planet	and survive,	they	would	have	to	change	how	things	were	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	daybreak,	Al	instructed	one	of	the	Watcher	drones	to	perform	a	search	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	area	the	natives	indicated	on	his	crude	dirt	map.	The	device	found	the	natives on	a	ledge	outside	a	network	of	caves	on	the	side	of	the	mountain.	The	Watcher</p>
<p class="calibre1">rewarded	 him	 with	 a	 view	 of	 men	 going	 out	 hunting,	 kids	 playing,	 and	 elders sitting	 in	 the	 sun.	 Al	 decided	 to	 suggest	 the	 captain	 make	 arrangements	 for	 a meeting	 as	 soon	 as	 possible.	 The	 colonists	 needed	 to	 know	 what	 the	 natives knew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later	 that	 morning,	 they	 discovered	 the	 dinosaurs	 they	 killed	 were	 not	 as they	 left	 them.	 During	 the	 night	 they	 were	 devoured	 until	 all	 that	 was	 left	 was white	 bones.	 Everyone	 assumed	 the	 carnivorous	 lizards	 were	 responsible.	 The scientists	wanted	samples	of	the	creatures	to	study,	so	a	few	bones	were	gathered and	taken	with	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	followed	the	captain’s	orders	to	unload	the	shuttles	and	secure	the	site</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 best	 they	 could.	 Then	 everyone—including	 Rudy’s	 body—returned	 to	 the Excalibur. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
THEY	HELD	THE	WAKE	in	the	hangar	bay,	with	Rudy’s	closed	casket	laying<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">off	 to	 one	 side	 behind	 a	 podium.	 Al	 and	 his	 friends	 sat	 at	 a	 long	 table	 and watched	while	different	people	took	turns	speaking	at	the	rostrum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rudy	had	no	family	aboard	like	most	colonists.	However,	he	did	have	a	lot	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">close	friends.	He	had	been	twenty-six	and	was	not	only	a	good	security	officer, he	also	held	a	master’s	degree	in	agriculture.	Rudy	was	excited	about	Avalon	and looked	 forward	 to	 transforming	 the	 planet	 into	 a	 garden	 world	 for	 the	 human race. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	it	was	Al’s	turn	to	speak,	he	was	not	ready.	He	still	didn’t	know	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 was	 going	 to	 say	 as	 he	 stepped	 up	 to	 the	 podium.	 The	 shocked	 crowd	 of almost	three	hundred	people	made	Al	more	than	a	little	nervous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	started	with,	“Rudy	Labronski	will	be	missed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chief	 Clark	 stood	 looking	 at	 the	 crowd	 for	 a	 few	 seconds,	 listening	 to	 the murmur	 of	 agreement	 and	 clink	 of	 their	 glasses	 in	 a	 silent	 salute.	 The	 crowd seemed	to	agree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	was	funny,	smart,	and	easily	likable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	spoke,	the	words	came	to	him.	“Rudy	believed	in	this	mission,	and	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn’t	 wait	 to	 help	 this	 colony	 carve	 out	 a	 place	 on	 this	 planet.	 He	 told	 me</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>more	than	once	he	was	looking	forward	to	the	type	of	life	we	would	be	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	no	family	except	us.	We	were	his	family.	There	were	eight	hundred	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">thirty-two	 people	 that	 survived	 the	 trip	 here,	 and	 as	 a	 contributing	 member,	 he played	an	important	part.	He	gave	his	life	to	protect	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	wanted	everyone	to	know	the	significance	of	Rudy’s	loss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rudy	 was	 the	 first	 to	 die	  <i class="calibre4">on	 </i> Avalon,	 and	 he	 will	 be	 the	 first	 to	 die	  <i class="calibre4">for</i> Avalon.	We	have	lost	a	friend,	but	his	sacrifice	was	for	a	cause	he	believed	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rudy	would	be	glad	no	one	else	was	hurt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	all	we	know,	we	could	be	the	last	people	to	leave	Earth.	If	we	were	able</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	return	to	Earth,	it	would	not	be	the	Earth	we	ran	from,	only	one	much	worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	planet	is	where	we	settle	the	human	race;	right	here	on	Avalon.	Rudy	knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">that,	and	it	excited	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al’s	mind	took	him	back	to	a	conversation	they	had	in	the	shuttle	on	the	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	 to	 Avalon.	 Rudy	 had	 big	 plans	 for	 the	 colony;	 thinking	 ten	 and	 twenty years	into	the	future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	was	proud	to	be	a	member	of	this	family,	and	I	think	he	will	be	proud	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	one	of	the	first	marked	down	in	the	Avalon	history	books.	He	will	not	only	be remembered—Rudy	Labroski	will	be	famous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hesitant	 clapping	 accompanied	 Al	 to	 his	 seat.	 Most	 of	 them	 were	 unsure what	was	appropriate,	with	it	being	a	wake	and	all.	Still,	they	were	all	nodding approval. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	gray	haired	captain	took	the	podium,	cleared	his	throat,	and	said,	“There</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	a	personal	file	for	every	person	aboard	the	 <i class="calibre4">Excalibur</i>.	In	that	file	is	a	form	that tells	us	what	you	want	done	with	your	remains	in	the	event	of	your	death.	Rudy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Labronski	 wanted	 to	 be	 buried	 on	 Avalon.	 It	 was	 his	 first	 and	 only	 choice.	 He added	 to	 the	 form,	 and	 included	 details	 such	 as:	 under	 a	 beautiful	 large	 tree, close	to	the	mountains,	with	a	river	nearby.	He	was	talking	about	Shangri-La.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	 Effinger	 stopped,	 hesitated,	 and	 continued,	 “We	 have	 decided	 to honor	 his	 wish	 and	 bury	 him	 accordingly.	 His	 funeral	 will	 be	 the	 second	 thing done	when	we	return	to	the	planet.	There	will	be	two	shuttles,	with	one	for	the funeral	and	room	for	twenty-five	people	and	two	pilots.	The	other	shuttle	we	will load	 with	 equipment	 and	 personnel	 to	 secure	 the	 camp	 from	 predators.	 The funeral	will	not	begin	until	the	compound	is	declared	safe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	down	and	considered	how	to	continue.	“This	is	not	the	planet	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">hoped	 to	 find.	 It	 appears	 the	 long-ago	 dinosaurs	 of	 our	 Earth,	 didn’t	 become extinct	on	Avalon.	We	will	be	sharing	the	land	with	these	monsters	and	will	have to	make...adjustments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	will	be	security	issues	to	deal	with,	and	we	will	have	to	rely	on	each</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	to	remain	safe.	Mister	Clark	is	responsible	for	colony	safety	and	needs	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>be	informed	of	anything	that	appears	remotely	dangerous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	gestured	towards	Al	and	nodded.	Al	grimaced	a	little	and	nodded	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	captain	finished	 with,	“We	will	 post	departure	times	 and	the	passenger</p>

<p class="calibre1">Al	left	to	be	alone	with	his	thoughts,	and	he	and	Robot	Nine	took	a	walk	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 park.	 The	 little	 robot	 was	 an	 excellent	 listener	 and	 only	 spoke	 when necessary.	 Strolling	 the	 cobblestone	 paths,	 with	 the	 trees	 and	 grass	 all	 around, helped	him	relax	and	think	more	clearly.	He	realized	that	colonizing	this	planet would	 be	 far	 harder	 than	 they	 could	 have	 imagined.

<p class="calibre1">When	they	returned	to	Shangri-La	four	days	later,	they	found	the	site</p>
<p class="calibre1">demolished.	The	canopy	was	in	shreds,	and	the	habitat	cubes	damaged</p>
<p class="calibre1">beyond	 repair.	 The	 single	 standing	 habitat	 that	 saved	 their	 lives	 was	 now scattered	 and	 in	 ruins.

It	 was	 decided	 this location	was	no	place	to	create	a	home,	and	certainly	no	place	to	bury	Rudy.	It made	no	sense	to	cling	to	this	spot	that	was	beautiful,	but	impossible	to	defend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	didn’t	bother	unpacking	and	received	permission	to	return	to	the	 <i class="calibre4">Excalibur</i>; to	reconsider	their	choice	of	settlement	sites. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 much	 discussion,	 it	 was	 decided	 to	 move	 the	 camp.	 A	 place	 was selected	 closer	 to	 the	 mountain,	 with	 their	 backs	 protected	 by	 stone	 cliffs	 and rough	 terrain.	 The	 natives	 were	 about	 a	 mile	 away,	 close	 enough	 to	 establish	 a relationship,	 and	 still	 far	 enough	 to	 keep	 the	 two	 settlements	 separated.

<p class="calibre1">up	to	the	camp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	time,	they	went	in	force.	Three	shuttles	were	loaded	with	personnel	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">equipment	and	sent	down	to	begin	again	at	the	new	location.	Their	first	priority was	 to	 construct	 a	 ten-foot	 sonic	 fence	 surrounding	 the	 construction	 site.	 They could	 enlarge	 the	 barrier	 later	 as	 they	 became	 more	 established	 and	 the settlement	grew.	The	following	day,	the	contact	specialists	would	seek	to	arrange a	meeting	with	the	natives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Additional	security	was	recruited,	and	Al	now	had	ten	security	officers	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 command.	 He	 left	 four	 men	 on	 the	 ship	 and	 came	 down	 to	 the	 planet	 with six.	Robot	Nine	was	fitted	with	a	laser	and	assigned	to	Al’s	department	full	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	found	it	ironic	that	the	robot	that	had	initially	tried	to	kill	him	was	now	going to	have	his	back. </p>

<p class="calibre1">As	soon	as	the	fence	was	operational,	they	held	the	funeral	for	Rudy.	It	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 Shangri-La,	 but	 at	 least	 he	 would	 be	 close	 to	 his	 friends.	 They	 buried	 him</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	settlement	was	going	to	be	permanent	and	would	remain	occupied	at	all</p>

IT	 WAS	 TWO	 ALIEN	 CONTACT	 specialists,	 two	 armed	 security	 officers, <p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Robot	Nine,	and	Al	that	went	to	meet	the	natives.	With	four	security	personnel</p>
<p class="calibre1">stationed	on	the	ship,	that	left	four	to	guard	the	camp.	Al	was	confident	that	with the	fence,	and	the	aid	of	the	watchers,	the	colony	would	be	safe	in	his	absence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	kept	the	party	small,	so	they	wouldn’t	frighten	the	Avalonians	and	carried gifts	 with	 them:	 blankets,	 cooking	 pans,	 canteens,	 and	 chocolate,	 all	 of	 which they	divided	among	the	travelers	to	carry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	party	had	their	breakfast	and	left	a	half-hour	after	dawn.	The	specialists</p>
<p class="calibre1">believed	the	predators	did	their	hunting	at	night,	so	it	should	be	safe	to	make	the trek	to	the	caves,	have	their	meeting,	and	get	back	before	dark.	They	did	not	take a	 shuttle,	 thinking	 it	 would	 scare	 the	 primitives	 into	 believing	 they	 were descending	 from	 wherever	 it	 is	 gods	 hang	 out.	 They	 wanted	 friends—not worshipers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Robot	 Nine	 took	 point,	 with	 Al	 directly	 behind,	 followed	 by	 the	 specialists and	 then	 his	 men.	 The	 two	 contact	 experts,	 Cindy	 and	 Rahul,	 talked	 non-stop behind	Al.	They	were	heading	towards	the	fulfillment	of	a	lifetime	ambition,	and all	 they	 could	 do	 was	 argue.	 Cindy	 wanted	 a	 more	 structured	 approach	 while Rahul	wanted	the	conversation	to	lead	their	discussion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	to	hear	them	out	and	give	them	a	chance	to	take	the	lead.	The	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	talk	to	us,	the	more	we	learn	from	them,”	Rahul	repeated	for	the	third	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	should	be	asking	the	questions,	and	ask	them	what	we	need	answers	to,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cindy	shot	back.	She	was	very	set	in	her	thinking	and	determined	to	be	heard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	are	they	going	to	know	what	our	questions	are?	They	can’t	understand</p>
<p class="calibre1">us.”	Rahul	asked	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	argument	went	back	and	forth	for	a	long	hour	before	Al	finally	turned	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	and	said,	“Listen	up	you	two.	We	are	walking	through	unexplored	territory, with	unknown	dangers,	and	predatory	creatures	that	are	drawn	to	noise.	I	believe when	 we	 get	 there,	 your	 training	 and	 education	 will	 take	 over	 and	 you	 will	 do</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a>just	 fine.	 Until	 then,	 let’s	 concentrate	 on	 our	 surroundings	 and	 leave	 the disagreements	until	later.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thirty	minutes	later,	Robot	Nine	warned,	“Movement	up	ahead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	saw	it	too,	behind	the	occasional	tree	on	each	side	shadows	moved;	never</p>
<p class="calibre1">quite	visible	in	the	light.	There	were	flashes	of	something	almost	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cindy	 noticed	 Al	 looking	 around	 and	 asked,	 “You	 see	 something,	 Mister Clark?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	are	being	watched...and	followed,”	Al	replied	in	a	subdued	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	short	time	later	Cindy	asked	her	colleague,	Rahul,	“Do	you	see	anything?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	I	see	are	trees	and	a	lot	of	grass.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	robot	stopped	for	a	second,	turned	to	Al,	and	quietly	reported,	“They	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">staying	 well	 back	 sir,	 and	 appear	 to	 be	 just	 observing.	 It	 is	 possibly	 the indigenous	 humanoids.	 We	 are	 only	 a	 half-mile	 from	 their	 caves.	 Should	 we continue?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	 of	 his	 men	 from	 the	 back	 of	 the	 procession	 spoke	 up,	 “What’s	 the holdup?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	think	the	natives	are	here,	and	keeping	an	eye	on	us,”	Al	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So—they	know	we’re	coming?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	said,	“If	that’s	true	it’s	a	good	thing.	We	don’t	want	to	surprise	them.	Is</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	right,	Cindy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cindy	agreed,	“It	is	better	 <i class="calibre4">not</i>	to	show	up	out	of	nowhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 wanted	 to	 keep	 moving.	 Their	 time	 was	 limited	 before	 they	 needed	 to head	 back	 to	 camp.	 “We	 are	 almost	 there	 everybody,	 so	 keep	 your	 eyes	 open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let’s	move	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	natives	were	not	surprised,	and	a	welcoming	party	dressed	in	their	finest</p>
<p class="calibre1">furs	 and	 embellishments	 was	 waiting	 when	 they	 arrived.	 A	 dozen	 members	 of the	tribe	were	lined	up	on	their	knees	with	their	foreheads	touching	the	ground; waiting	for	their	gods	to	acknowledge	them.	The	two	young	natives	Al	and	Liz</p>
<p class="calibre1">met	were	there	kneeling	with	the	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 nodded	 at	 the	 specialists	 and	 Rahul	 took	 the	 lead.	 He	 walked	 across	 the line	 smiling	 and	 gesturing	 for	 them	 to	 stand.	 The	 natives	 hesitantly	 stood	 but kept	their	eyes	firmly	on	the	ground.	Rahul	positioned	himself	before	the	center individual,	who	appeared	to	be	the	eldest	and	the	best	dressed.	He	presented	him with	 a	 bar	 of	 chocolate.	 The	 Elder	 accepted	 the	 gift	 with	 a	 broad	 smile	 and motioned	for	the	youngest	of	his	group	to	present	the	natives	tribute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 gift	 Rahul	 received	 was	 the	 most	 unique	 necklace	 Al	 had	 ever	 seen.	 It was	woven	from	a	fine	colored	hair	that	produced	a	thin	sixteen-inch-long	multi-colored	chain	of	crafted	beauty.	The	presenter	removed	it	from	around	his	neck</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	handed	it	to	Rahul,	who	ceremoniously	placed	it	around	his	neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>“I	call	dibs	on	the	necklace,”	he	announced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can’t	do	that,”	Cindy	protested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay	you	two,”	said	Al. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Rahul	presented	each	of	the	welcoming	party	with	a	bar	of	chocolate, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they	were	happy	at	first,	until	it	occurred	to	some	of	them	they	had	only	one	gift, and	received	twelve.	Al	could	see	their	thoughts	become	conflicted.	They	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">afraid	the	one	necklace	wasn’t	enough	tribute.	After	the	gods	assured	them	their tribute	was	sufficient,	they	were	invited	up	to	the	caves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	uncertain	natives	ushered	the	visitors	into	a	large	room,	with	two	dozen</p>
<p class="calibre1">spectators	standing	respectfully	to	the	side.	Soft	brushed	hide	pillows	lay	on	flat rocks	 and	 acted	 as	 seats,	 and	 an	 abundance	 of	 food	 on	 a	 large	 wooden	 table waited	for	the	visitor’s	pleasure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 natives	 loosened	 up	 in	 time,	 and	 a	 stuttering	 dialog	 began.	 They	 all enjoyed	the	exotic	food,	and	the	delicious	fare	helped	to	put	both	groups	at	ease. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 specialists	 did	 most	 of	 the	 talking	 since	 they	 were	 the	 experts.	 There were	universal	gestures	such	as	a	nod	meaning	 <i class="calibre4">yes</i>	and	a	head	shake	meaning	 <i class="calibre4">no</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,	the	bulk	of	communication	was	through	facial	expressions,	pointing	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">various	things,	and	drawing	on	the	dirt	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	colonists	learned	a	lot	about	their	new	home	and	its	inhabitants	that	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 were	 told	 the	 winters	 in	 the	 mountains	 were	 cold,	 and	 how	 much	 the natives	 loved	 the	 blankets	 given	 to	 them	 by	 their	 guests.	 With	 looks	 of amazement,	 they	 accepted	 the	 aluminum	 alloy	 cooking	 pots,	 and	 it	 became apparent	 the	 tribe	 would	 treasure	 the	 hard,	 shiny,	 cookery.	 The	 canteens,	 with their	magical	screw-top-caps	and	insulating	coatings,	would	make	carrying	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">storing	water	much	easier;	which	the	natives	loved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 time,	 the	 discussion	 turned	 to	 dangerous	 animals.	 There	 were	 many</p>
<p class="calibre1">predators	on	Avalon,	but	the	king	of	the	meat	eating	beasts	were	the	Riktors.	The Sansi	were	terrified	of	the	creatures	that	killed	Rudy	and	almost	always	hunted in	pairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	learned	the	two	rampaging	monsters	killed	by	the	settlers	were	part	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">territorial	group	of	ten	or	so,	which	terrorized	and	ate	every	native	out	after	dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	caves	they	were	so	proud	of	acted	as	their	refuge,	and	provided	shelter	from the	predators	of	Avalon	for	generations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 natives	 were	 family	 oriented,	 intelligent,	 and	 loved	 to	 laugh.	 It	 took some	time	to	explain	the	human's	desire	for	one	of	the	Sansi	to	visit	the	colonists at	 their	 camp.	 He	 or	 she	 would	 temporarily	 live	 with	 the	 settlers	 and	 learn	 the human	language.	The	ability	to	communicate	was	the	biggest	stumbling	block	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 relationship,	 and	 the	 specialists	 deemed	 that	 teaching	 the	 natives	 English</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>was	 priority	 one.	 In	 two	 days’	 time,	 one	 lucky	 Avalonian	 would	 be	 living	 with the	Gods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	natives	escorted	the	colonists	halfway	to	the	settlement,	and	then	rushed</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	to	beat	the	coming	darkness.	The	greeting	party	also	hurried	home. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
THE	RETURN	TRIP	WAS	an	easy	walk,	with	three	to	four-foot	greenery	lining<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">the	path	they	followed,	and	they	were	making	good	time.	Just	outside	the	fence, and	inside	the	Watchers	perimeter,	a	bush	reached	out	and	grabbed	Al’s	leg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	long	red	tongue	wrapped	itself	around	his	ankle	and	was	trying	to	pull	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 it.	 Al	 told	 everyone	 to	 get	 back,	 drew	 his	 sidearm,	 and	 put	 a	 hole	 into	 the attacking	 appendage.	 There	 was	 an	 anguished	 scream,	 and	 the	 tongue	 released him	 and	 retreated.	 A	 three	 foot	 tall	 cross	 between	 an	 anteater	 and	 an	 armadillo bolted	 out	 of	 the	 bush	 and	 disappeared	 into	 the	 woods.	 A	 few	 nearby	 bushes rattled	as	several	others	took	the	opportunity	to	do	the	same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	cried,	“Whoa—what	was	that?	It	almost	had	me!”	Ten	feet	in	front	of	Al</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 at	 the	 front	 of	 the	 procession,	 was	 the	 robot.	 “Were	 you	 sleeping	 Robot Nine?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 two	 arms	 facing	 him	 went	 up.	 “I	 am	 sorry,	 Al	 Clark.	 My	 sensors detected	no	dangers.	I	will	add	this	new	creature	to	my	threat	programs...and	I	do not	sleep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 took	 a	 few	 steps	 and	 decided	 he	 could	 go	 on.	 He	 looked	 up	 at	 the darkening	sky,	and	then	to	the	people	surrounding	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	better	keep	moving...it’s	getting	late.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	leg	didn’t	hurt	much;	it	just	felt	a	little	tingly.	It	did	not	seem	to	affect	his walking,	 and	 there	 were	 no	 cuts	 on	 his	 pant	 leg,	 so	 he	 figured	 it	 was	 all	 right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 they	 reached	 the	 fence,	 they	 collectively	 breathed	 a	 sigh	 of	 relief.	 Their first	contact	excursion	was	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 they	 passed	 through	 the	 gate,	 Al	 was	 struck	 by	 the	 progress	 they	 had already	 achieved.	 In	 only	 two	 days,	 the	 primitive	 camp	 was	 already	 changing into	 a	 little	 town.	 A	 soft	 hum	 permeated	 the	 air	 from	 portable	 power	 supplies, and	lights	were	flickering	on	to	keep	the	darkness	at	bay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 all	 the	 added	 colonists,	 progress	 in	 Camelot	 was	 accelerating.	 The shuttles	 had	 unloaded	 and	 returned	 to	 the	 ship	 for	 more	 people	 and	 supplies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Four	habitats	were	complete,	with	level	surfaces	prepared	for	four	more.	Most	of the	 trees	 inside	 the	 perimeter	 had	 been	 cut	 down	 and	 used	 to	 make	 numerous forms	 of	 lumber.	 Nothing	 was	 left	 to	 waste	 with	 even	 the	 sawdust	 used	 to	 fill sidewalks	to	keep	the	mud	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>Al	sent	Robot	Nine	to	make	its	rounds,	checked	with	his	men,	and	then	sat down	in	one	of	the	habitats	to	do	some	paperwork.	He	plugged	in	his	data	pad	to recharge	and	bent	down	to	raise	his	pant	leg	and	check	his	ankle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 he	 pulled	 the	 pant	 leg	 up,	 he	 was	 shocked	 by	 what	 he	 saw.	 An	 inch above	 his	 boot	 was	 a	 circular	 wound,	 with	 a	 red	 furrow	 that	 went	 through	 the skin	and	clear	to	the	bone.	He	was	horrified.	He	felt	little	pain,	and	there	was	not enough	blood	for	it	to	be	this	bad. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">How	have	I	been	walking	around	on	this?	Why	doesn’t	it	hurt	like	crazy? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">He	bent	down	further	for	a	closer	look. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The	bone	doesn’t	look	white;	it	looks	kind	of...silver;	and	there	are	wires? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	Clark	grabbed	a	clean	towel	to	wipe	the	blood	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">That	is	not	bone;	that’s	metal...I	have	a	metal	leg? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 leaned	 back	 and	 took	 a	 deep	 breath.	 He	 was	 staring	 at	 the	 far	 wall	 with unseeing	eyes;	his	mind	busy	with	what	this	discovery	might	mean. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Are	 both	 legs	 artificial?	 Would	 that	 explain	 his	 ability	 to	 run?	 Don’t	 both</i> <i class="calibre4">legs	have	to	match	to	keep	from	falling? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	dozen	possibilities	scrolled	through	his	mind,	and	with	the	world	on	hold, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	sat	unmoving	for	several	minutes.	One	conclusion	he	came	to	was	he	needed</p>
<p class="calibre1">help,	and	someone	he	could	trust.	He	also	knew	Doc	Cody	was	setting	up	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	habitats	as	a	clinic	nearby,	so	he	rolled	his	trouser	leg	down	and	went	to	see him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	doctor	was	alone	when	he	entered,	and	Al	wasted	no	time	showing	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	leg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	on	Earth....ah...what	has	happened	to	you?”	Cody	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 was	 attacked	 by	 a	 giant	 ant-eater/armadillo	 on	 the	 way	 back.	 The	 leg tingles,	 but	 it	 doesn’t	 hurt,	 and	 I’ve	 been	 walking	 around	 on	 it	 for	 two	 hours since	the	attack.	It	hardly	bothers	me	at	all.	Something	else	Doc...I	think	there	is metal	inside.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doc	smiled	and	asked	Al,	“Now	why	would	you	think	that	Mister	Clark?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take	a	look	if	you	don’t	believe	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	quick	examination,	the	doctor	discovered	Al	was	indeed	correct. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	did	not	know	about	this?”	his	friend	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Umm—amnesia	Doc,	remember?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh...yes,	sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doctor	Cody	was	now	intrigued.	He	told	Al	to	sit	on	the	bed,	and	Cody	took</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 closer	 look.	 “I	 have	 never	 seen	 anything	 like	 this.	 Your	 leg	 does	 not	 look artificial.	Please,	lie	down	so	I	can	scan	it,”	ordered	the	doctor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 portable	 scanner	 was	 already	 set	 up,	 and	 it	 took	 only	 a	 few	 minutes	 to complete	 the	 scan.	 Cody’s	 face	 grew	 puzzled.	 He	 made	 some	 changes	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>machine	 and	 scanned	 again,	 this	 time,	 the	 scanner	 went	 from	 head	 to	 toe.	 Al could	 see	 his	 face,	 but	 not	 the	 monitor	 he	 was	 looking	 at	 with	 wide	 eyes.	 Doc Cody’s	expression	was	puzzling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	see	Cody?”	Al	begged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 physician	 appeared	 deep	 in	 thought	 for	 a	 second;	 then	 he	 shook	 off whatever	was	clogging	his	thinking	and	locked	the	door.	He	pulled	the	curtains</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	windows	so	no	one	could	see	inside.	He	returned	to	Al	looking	hesitant, </p>
<p class="calibre1">flustered,	and	maybe	a	little	scared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 do	 not	 know	 how	 to	 tell	 you	 this,	 my	 friend.”	 He	 glanced	 again	 at	 the screen	as	if	disbelieving	his	eyes.	Cody	turned	to	him	with	conflicted	eyes	and said,	“It	appears,	Al...that	you	are	not	human.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	jumped	up	and	swung	around	to	look	at	the	monitor.	What	he	saw	was	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	 he	 expected	 to	 see	 inside	 a	 human	 body.	 The	 screen	 revealed	 mechanical and	 electrical	 components;	 with	 thin	 metal	 rods,	 micropumps,	 tiny	 circuit structures,	 and	 ribbons	 of	 complex	 wiring	 connecting	 everything	 together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where	his	heart	should	be—a	red	power	supply	glowed. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Fourteen</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	almost	laughed	until	he	realized	it	might	make	him	appear	crazy.	His</p>
<p class="calibre1">reality	 had	 changed	 when	 Cody	 said	 those	 words.	 A	 flurry	 of	 thoughts became	jumbled	and	confused,	and	he	swayed	a	little	where	he	stood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	you	had	better	sit	down,	Al,”	Cody	recommended. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feeling	light	headed,	Al	nodded	and	sat	down	on	the	scanner	bed,	mumbled</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	incoherent	things	the	doctor	couldn’t	make	out	and	passed	out,	or	crashed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever	 the	 case	 might	 be,	 the	 news	 was	 too	 much	 for	 anybody,	 and	 Al	 shut down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later,	Al	asked	Cody,	“How	long	was	I	asleep?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About	thirty	minutes.	That	is	how	long	it	takes	to	reboot	all	your	systems.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">watched	each	of	them	come	back	online	with	the	scanner.	It	was	fascinating.	If</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	don’t	mind	my	saying,	you	are	a	very	sophisticated	machine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	a	dream...or	a	nightmare.	It	can’t	be	real,”	groaned	Al. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	afraid	it	is	real	my	friend.	I	have	even	tried	pinching	 <i class="calibre4">myself</i>.	It	hurts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	playing	a	joke	on	me,	right	Doc?”	Al	hoped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wish	that	were	so.	You	can	see	for	yourself	what	is	inside	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 remembered	 protests	 on	 Earth	 and	 laws	 that	 were	 passed,	 “Aren’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">humanoid	robots	banned	on	Earth?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes—they	are.	I	did	hear	rumors	that	development	was	secretly	still	going</p>
<p class="calibre1">on.	I	did	not	believe	the	research	had	gotten	this	far.	Now	I	believe	because	here you	are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	revelation	was	going	to	take	a	while	to	sink	in.	At	this	point,	Al	wasn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">sure	what	to	think.	He	needed	to	get	back	to	his	routine	and	get	busy	or	go	crazy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 can’t	 tell	 anybody.	 There	 must	 be	 a	 reason	 there	 is	 no	 mention	 of	 Al Clark	in	the	computer	and	why	nobody	remembers	me	but	Captain	Effinger.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 are	 my	 friend...regardless	 of	 what	 you	 are.	 I	 will	 say	 nothing,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">promised	his	friend	and	confidante. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	Cody,	because	I	have	a	feeling	I	might	need	all	the	friends	I	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">get.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doc	 Cody	 cleaned	 and	 wrapped	 his	 leg.	 He	 admitted	 he	 did	 not	 know	 how much	it	would	help.	The	technology	used	to	create	Al’s	body	was	way	outside	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	expertise.	They	could	only	hope	his	leg	would	heal	itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>He	left	Cody	at	the	clinic	and	took	a	walk	around	the	perimeter	fence	to	clear his	head. </p>

<p class="calibre1">So	many	questions	circled	in	his	mind	with	nowhere	to	turn	for	answers—or</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 there?	 The	 captain	 seemed	 to	 know	 more	 than	 he	 let	 on.	 Maybe	 he	 knew about	this.	If	Al	asked	the	right	questions,	he	might	get	some	answers.	One	thing was	for	sure.	He	had	to	be	careful,	and	no	one	should	know	that	didn’t	need	to.	It was	possible	even	the	captain	was	against	humanoid	robots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	thought	of	his	need	for	sleep.	He	had	dreams. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Do	robots	dream? </i>	Al	didn’t	know.	It	was	all	very	confusing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	decided	to	talk	to	the	only	robot	he	knew	well—Robot	Nine.	At	least,	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">robot	 could	 not	 lie,	 or	 hate.	 It	 was	 late,	 and	 most	 of	 the	 colonists	 were	 asleep when	he	summoned	the	mechanical	with	his	pad	and	met	the	machine	near	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">secluded	equipment	on	the	south	side	of	camp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	was	not	sure	how	to	start.	“Robot	Nine...am	I	human?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes	sir,	you	are	a	human.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	answer	surprised	Al.	“Am	I	a	robot?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes	sir,	you	are	a...robot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	is	it?”	he	pressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	sensors	tell	me	you	are	both	human	and	robotic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	explain	yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	a	human	brain	organ	and	a	robotic	body,	sir.	Does	this	cause	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">discomfort?	I	sense	conflict	in	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	no	idea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	my	answers	cause	you	discomfort,	why	do	you	ask	harmful	questions?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	I	need	to	know	who	I	am.	I	guess	that’s	the	human	part	of	me.”	Al</p>
<p class="calibre1">continued,	“What	are	my	capabilities?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	no	data	on	your	capabilities,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Disappointed	the	little	robot	didn’t	know	more,	Al	sank	into	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	 we	 discuss	 security	 details,	 sir,	 I	 do	 not	 wish	 to	 cause	 you	 further harm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	one-time	rogue	robot	seemed	to	possess	a	need	to	please	him. </p>

<p class="calibre1">CAPTAIN	 TOBIAS	 EFFINGER	 was	 extremely	 busy,	 and	 he	 didn’t	 like	 it.	 He didn’t	think	he	should	be.	The	captain	wanted	to	be	flying	shuttle	missions	and helping	the	colony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 this	 stage	 of	 their	 mission,	 it	 should	 be	 routine	 maintenance	 and preparation	for	planetfall.	The	discovery	of	the	dinosaurs	on	Avalon	complicated things,	 but	 this	 ship	 and	 the	 people	 on	 board	 were	 equipped	 to	 handle	 almost anything.	 He	 understood	 that	 the	 vessel	 was	 their	 home	 for	 forty-something years.	 Still,	 they	 should	 be	 shutting	 things	 down	 as	 the	 colonists	 left	 for	 the planet,	and	preparing	the	ship	to	perform	settlement	operations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,	things	seemed	to	keep	going	wrong	on	his	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 first	 problem	 was	 the	 air	 scrubbers	 for	 the	 hangar	 bay.	 Somehow	 the scrubber	 panels	 had	 been	 reversed	 in	 their	 slots.	 When	 people	 started	 passing out,	the	mistake	was	found	and	corrected.	The	simple	error	could	have	resulted</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	a	grave	disaster,	and	the	captain	was	angry	that	someone	as	well	trained	as	his people	could	allow	it	to	happen	at	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 the	 hangar	 bay	 door	 started	 acting	 up.	 It	 began	 opening	 to	 space without	 the	 force	 field	 in	 place;	 which	 should	 never	 occur.	 If	 not	 for	 the	 quick thinking	 of	 a	 ship	 engineer,	 the	 doors	 unprotected	 opening	 could	 have	 led	 to decompression	of	the	hangar	bay	and	a	serious	disaster.	Until	they	could	upgrade the	security	protocols,	he	was	forced	to	post	a	guard	on	the	door	controls.	They could	not	let	it	happen	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 captain	 was	 currently	 at	 the	 medical	 center	 talking	 to	 the	 staff.	 People were	getting	sick,	and	the	doctors	were	saying	the	water	in	the	habitat	ring	was the	cause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	is	something	in	the	water?”	asked	the	captain	of	the	senior	MD. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 sir,	 the	 analysis	 we	 did	 showed	 a	 high	 level	 of	 contamination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	was	added;	to	make	it	toxic.	The	system	has	numerous	types	of	filters that	 would	 have	 caught	 it,	 so	 we	 think	 the	 poison	 was	 put	 in	 after	 the	 filters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	did	this	on	purpose	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	astonished	this	could	happen	on	his	ship.	In	all	his	years	of	service, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 had	 never	 had	 to	 deal	 with	 sabotage.	 “Secure	 all	 access	 to	 that	 system	 after the	filters;	bolt	it,	weld	it,	do	whatever	it	takes,	but	get	it	done.	Are	my	people still	in	danger?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	flushed	the	system,	sir.	That	should	take	care	of	it.”	was	the	quick</p>
<p class="calibre1">reply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Too	 many	 problems	 in	 a	 short	 period.	 He	 had	 to	 assume	 they	 might	 be related.	 Captain	 Effinger	 left	 the	 medical	 center	 and	 headed	 back	 to	 the	 bridge</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>with	his	assistant.	There	were	over	seven	hundred	souls	on	board,	and	someone appeared	to	be	working	against	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 captain’s	 cabin	 attached	 to	 the	 bridge,	 the	 onboard	 head	 of	 security recommended	they	increase	patrols	to	every	half	hour	and	concentrate	on	critical systems.	 The	 captain	 agreed,	 and	 added,	 “I	 know	 there	 are	 only	 four	 of	 you aboard.	Still,	I	need	you	to	begin	an	investigation	into	each	incident.	Advise	all senior	officers	of	the	investigations,	and	ask	for	their	assistance.	They	may	know something	that	could	be	useful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 need	 to	 go	 through	 everyone’s	 personnel	 files	 looking	 for	 anomalies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Recruit	help	from	other	departments	if	you	have	to.	Do	you	understand?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	security	man	looked	uncomfortable,	and	replied,	“Yes	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	need	to	find	this	person,	and	quickly.	Get	to	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally	alone,	he	could	take	some	time	to	think.	He	was	starting	a	search	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 own	 on	 his	 terminal	 when	 his	 data	 pad	 chimed.	 The	 radio	 technician reported,	“Call	from	Chief	Clark,	sir,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Put	it	through	please.”	When	the	line	cleared,	he	said,	“This	is	the	captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello	Captain,	Chief	Clark	here.	I	need	to	speak	with	you,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	go	ahead	son.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	 sir,	 I	 need	 to	 speak	 with	 you	 in	 person.	 I	 would	 like	 to	 arrange	 a meeting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	 something	 wrong	 Chief?”	 The	 captain	 didn’t	 like	 the	 way	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversation	was	sounding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	sir—it’s	personal.	I	have	a	few	questions	about	myself	that	I	hope	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	help	me	with.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	the	captain	was	concerned.	“One	of	the	shuttles	is	returning	tomorrow, </p>
<p class="calibre1">is	that	soon	enough?	Contact	me	when	you	get	aboard	the	 <i class="calibre4">Excalibur, </i> and	we	can talk.	Are	you	sure	you	can’t	tell	me	what	this	is	about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	the	other	end,	Al	was	aching	to	blurt	it	out.	One	question	would	do	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Am	 I	 a	 robot? </i>	 Unfortunately,	 he	 could	 trust	 no	 one	 right	 now	 except	 Doc Cody. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	sir...I’m	sure.	See	you	tomorrow.	Have	a	good	evening.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	looking	forward	to	seeing	you,	Mister	Clark.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	 you,	 sir.”	 Al	 closed	 the	 circuit	 feeling	 hopeful.	 The	 captain	 knew more	 than	 he	 was	 saying;	 how	 much	 more	 was	 anyone’s	 guess,	 but	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew...something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	captain	had	been	dreading	this	day	for	some	time.	Ever	since	Al	failed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognize	 him	 when	 they	 met	 after	 his	 awakening,	 he	 knew	 something	 was wrong.	He	might	have	to	be	the	one	to	tell	a	man	he	was	not	entirely	human.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>was	 just	 a	 matter	 of	 time	 before	 Mister	 Clark	 figured	 it	 out.	 He	 assumed something	must	have	happened	that	gave	it	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	captain	was	also	excited.	If	Al	were	to	become	aware	of	his	capabilities, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 learned	 to	 use	 them	 constructively,	 he	 could	 become	 one	 of	 the	 most valuable	 assets	 available.	 The	 problem	 was	 his	 information	 will	 be	 very unsettling	for	Al,	and	quite	possibly	dangerous. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
AL	 HAD	 FOUR	 HOURS	 SLEEP	 when	 he	 got	 up	 and	 went	 to	 breakfast.	 He<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">decided	on	a	light	breakfast	even	though	he	wasn’t	especially	hungry.	This	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	to	be	a	long	day,	and	he	wanted	to	start	with	a	full	stomach.	Besides,	he was	not	tired.	A	dull	ache	throbbed	in	his	head	which	slowly	diminished	as	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning	 progressed.	 The	 shuttle	 wasn’t	 leaving	 for	 another	 two	 hours,	 so	 he went	to	the	mess	hall	and	ordered	an	egg,	grabbed	an	orange	juice,	and	took	his breakfast	to	a	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	didn’t	look	like	anybody	suspected	he	was	different.	He	felt	different.  <i class="calibre4">Is	Al</i> <i class="calibre4">Clark	my	name?	Why	can’t	I	remember? </i>	Questions	bounced	around	in	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 trying	 to	 convince	 himself	 there	 were	 good	 things	 about	 being robotic.	He	would	live	as	long	as	his	brain	did.  <i class="calibre4">That’s	good,	right? </i>	He	should	be stronger.  <i class="calibre4">Why	am	I	not	stronger?	Why	am	I	eating? </i> His	confused	state	of	mind preoccupied	 him	 as	 he	 ate	 his	 breakfast;	 sitting	 alone,	 watching	 all	 the	 humans go	about	their	business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 shuttle	 left	 on	 time	 and	 arrived	 at	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Excalibur</i>	 on	 schedule.	 It	 was always	inspiring	to	see	the	great	ship	in	space,	and	to	appreciate	the	scale	of	the starship	 as	 they	 approached.	 The	 ship	 was	 an	 amazing	 accomplishment	 and	 a tribute	to	the	human	race.	He	was	a	little	surprised	to	find	it	felt	good	to	be	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	met	in	the	captain’s	cabin	for	lunch.	When	Al	arrived,	he	was	escorted</p>
<p class="calibre1">directly	to	his	cabin.	It	was	just	the	two	of	them	at	the	long	table,	and	the	captain seemed	a	little—uneasy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	have	a	seat,	Mister	Clark.	I	believe	we’re	having	cheeseburgers	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">afternoon,	or	what	passes	for	cheeseburgers	these	days.	I’ll	be	glad	when	we	get some	 real	 cows	 in	 a	 pasture.	 Packaged	 food	 and	 vegetables	 only	 go	 so	 far	 for me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	pulled	out	a	chair	and	sat	down	at	the	table	laid	out	with	a	formal	setting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	 you	 for	 seeing	 me	 so	 quickly	 sir;	 I	 know	 you’ve	 been	 really	 busy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	briefed	me	on	the	situation	aboard	ship.	Any	leads	on	the	saboteur	yet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 leader	 of	 the	 colony	 rearranged	 his	 place	 setting,	 looking	 down	 as	 if thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>“Nothing	that’s	panned	out	yet.	Now,	what’s	this	all	about	Mister	Clark?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	captain	had	gotten	directly	to	the	point,	and	Al	was	not	yet	sure	how	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">start.	 What	 he	 asked	 next	 could	 be	 the	 moment	 of	 truth;	 or	 not.	 He	 liked	 the captain	and	wanted	to	trust	him,	but	should	he	dip	in	a	toe...or	jump	in	feet	first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	tired	of	mysteries.	He	dove	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	know	I	was...artificial?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	 Effinger	 took	 a	 deep	 breath,	 checked	 his	 place	 setting	 again,	 then looked	him	in	the	eye	and	said,	“Yes	Al,	I	did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve	known	all	this	time?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	captain	visibly	tensed	and	with	more	than	a	little	guilt	he	answered	Al’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">question.	“Since	I	received	the	order	to	allow	you	on	board.	A	month	before	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">left.	I	have	a	book	that	came	with	you	that	is	way	over	my	head.	However,	to	the right	person,	I’m	sure	it	explains	a	lot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	pause,	he	continued,	“You	have	the	most	advanced	robotic	body	ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">created—or	at	least,	it	was	forty	years	ago.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	didn’t	you	tell	me?	I’ve	been	going	crazy	trying	to	figure	this	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	ordered	from	the	beginning	to	keep	your	secret.	Most	people	wouldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand	that	you	are	a	human	with	a	robot	body,	they	would	only	see	you	as	a robot;	 disguised	 as	 a	 human.	 I	 am	 truly	 sorry,	 Al.	 Maybe	 I	 should	 have	 told you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	my	name	Al	Clark?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 captain	 took	 a	 sip	 of	 his	 wine	 and	 chuckled,	 “That	 is	 the	 name	 the technical	 assistants	 gave	 you.	 They	 thought	 it	 was	 clever.	 The	 name	 on	 your compartment	door	actually	said	ALARM	CLOCK.	How	you	got	Al	Clark	out	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">that,	I	don’t	know...but	you	were	close.	You	were	supposed	to	be	our	backup	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 computer	 failed	 and	 were	 to	 wake	 us	 up	 if	 all	 else	 failed.	 It	 worked	 too—</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	ten	years	later	than	we	planned.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	Porter	stuck	his	head	through	the	door	and	asked	if	they	were	ready	to	start</p>
<p class="calibre1">dinner.	The	captain	said,	“Yes,	of	course,	come	on	in.”	While	the	Porter	was	with them,	they	lapsed	into	silence,	both	thinking	thoughts	of	their	own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 cheeseburgers	 were	 good.	 Al	 couldn’t	 remember	 ever	 eating	 one	 even though	the	taste	was	familiar.	Somewhere	in	his	past,	he	had	liked	cheeseburgers and	still	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	Al	ate	several	more	questions	came	to	mind,	and	he	voiced	one,	“Why</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	I	eat	and	drink?	My	robot	body	doesn’t	need	it...does	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	body	runs	on	a	power	pack	inside	your	chest.	Your	brain	and	the	outer</p>
<p class="calibre1">layer	of	your	skin,	however,	are	organic	and	require	nutrition	and	fluids.	You	get that	 by	 eating	 and	 drinking.	 Though	 you	 need	 less	 than	 most	 people	 do,”	 the captain	explained. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>His	cheeseburger	was	only	half	eaten	when	Al	found	he’d	lost	interest	in	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 already	 full.  <i class="calibre4">The	 captain	 was	 right;	 he	 did	 seem	 to	 eat	 less	 than	 other</i> <i class="calibre4">people. </i>	 He	 pushed	 himself	 back	 from	 the	 table,	 leaned	 back	 in	 the	 chair,	 and picked	his	next	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	I	need	sleep?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	brain	needs	sleep,	but	there	again	not	as	much	as	other	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	can’t	I	remember	anything	before	my...awakening?”	Al	wasn’t	sure	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	woke	up	or	was	turned	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	 Effinger	 answered,	 “Now	 there	 I	 can’t	 help	 you.	 The	 first	 time	 we met,	 before	 departure,	 you	 knew	 precisely	 who	 you	 were.	 You	 volunteered	 for this	you	see.	The	paperwork	I	received	said	you	were	in	a	bad	accident	and	left without	the	use	of	your	arms	or	legs.	They	offered	to	give	you	a	new	body	and	a ticket	on	the	Excalibur,	and	you	jumped	at	it.	You	were	excited	and	counted	the days	until	departure.	I	don’t	know	what	happened.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	 the	 captain	 said	 made	 Al	 feel	 better.	 His	 life	 had	 apparently	 taken	 a turn	for	the	worse,	and	when	they	offered	him	a	chance	for	a	better	life	he	had accepted.	 Now	 he	 wanted	 to	 know	 more	 about	 the	 benefits	 of	 that	 decision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	good	about	his	robot	body?	I	don’t	seem	to	be	unusually	strong	or	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	faster	than	an	average	person.	Do	you	know	why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 roboticist	 that	 designed	 your	 body,	 a	 Doctor	 Hawthorn,	 told	 me	 your body	 was	 locked	 in	 a	  <i class="calibre4">human	 simulation</i>	 mode	 until	 conditions	 allowed	 the setting	to	be	overridden	or	changed.	They	didn’t	want	you	drawing	unnecessary</p>
<p class="calibre1">attention	to	yourself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	thought	it	might	be	nice	to	meet	his	creator,	“I	would	sure	love	to	talk	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	guy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hawthorn	 <i class="calibre4">was	</i> aboard.	He	went	through	a	lot	to	get	a	pass	and	accompany you.	 Unfortunately,	 he	 died	 before	 we	 could	 wake	 him...sorry.	 I’ve	 done	 some checking,	though,	and	there	is	a	roboticist	aboard	that	was	familiar	with	Doctor Hawthorn’s	work.	He’s	someone	you	might	want	to	talk	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	his	name?”	asked	Al. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 a	 twinkle	 in	 Tobias’	 eye	 as	 he	 answered,	 “His	 name	 is	 Edward Florida.	I	should	warn	you—he	is	quite	a	character.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	captain’s	smile	grew.	“He	works	in	the	robot	repair	shop,	and	I	think	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	fix	you	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 funny,	 sir,”	 Al	 replied	 half-heartedly.	 “I	 have	 some	 coordinating	 to do	 with	 my	 officers	 about	 your	 investigations	 and	 won’t	 be	 leaving	 until tomorrow,	so	I	think	I	will	look	him	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 captain	 and	 the	 security	 chief	 spent	 another	 hour	 talking	 about	 the situations	both	on	board	the	ship,	and	down	on	the	planet.	Al	asked	if	he	needed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a>more	men	to	find	the	saboteur,	and	the	captain	declined,	believing	Al	needed	the men	he	had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	 the	 time	 they	 parted	 company,	 Al	 was	 feeling	 better.	 It	 was	 the	 most enlightening	afternoon	of	Al’s	life—that	he	could	remember. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
AL	WANTED	TO	SPEND	some	time	with	his	friends	while	on	board	and	made<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">his	way	to	Elizabeth	and	Chris’	quarters	to	finish	the	evening.	Al	was	struggling with	 whether	 or	 not	 he	 should	 tell	 them,	 and	 was	 stepping	 through	 the	 airlock into	the	yellow	section	when	the	lights	flickered,	and	then	went	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	few	seconds,	everything	stopped.	Total	silence	joined	the	absolute	dark</p>
<p class="calibre1">until	the	emergency	lights	stuttered,	flashed,	and	relit	the	corridor.	In	the	distance came	 the	 sound	 of	 running	 footsteps,	 and	 the	 world	 restarted;	 quickly	 winding up	to	full	speed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elizabeth	 was	 running	 down	 the	 corridor	 toward	 him.	 Right	 before	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1">reached	 him,	 the	 ship	 jumped,	 followed	 by	 the	 sound	 of	 a	 distant	 explosion. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">That’s	not	good. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	going	on	Liz?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 racing	 woman	 used	 him	 to	 break	 her	 forward	 momentum	 and	 slid	 to	 a stop.	She	took	a	moment	to	catch	her	breath	and	exclaimed,	“We	have	a	fire	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 habitat	 ring’s	 main	 power	 room	 in	 the	 blue	 section.	 That	 sound	 was	 an explosion,	and	we	need	to	get	there	fast.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Any	fire	on	a	spaceship	can	be	a	ticket	to	disaster.	In	such	a	contained	space, if	the	flames	didn’t	get	you,	the	smoke	would.	There	is	also	the	risk	of	breaching the	hull	and	rapid	decompression.	Fires	created	fear	on	a	spaceship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	worked	their	way	through	the	airlock	and	ran	down	the	orange	section</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	blue	access	airlock.	The	closer	they	got,	the	more	people	they	saw	going the	 opposite	 direction	 towards	 safety.	 Liz	 and	 Al	 did	 not	 have	 that	 option.	 She was	the	senior	electrical	engineer,	and	he	was	responsible	for	ship	security.	This problem	was	their	job. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 air	 around	 the	 airlock	 was	 smoky,	 and	 they	 had	 to	 force	 their	 way through	 the	 people	 leaving	 to	 wait	 for	 the	 doors	 to	 cycle,	 then	 push	 their	 way into	the	blue	section.	The	blue	corridor	on	the	other	side	of	the	airlock	was	thick with	black	smoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 power	 room	 is	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 passageway	 by	 the	 number	 three spoke,”	 Liz	 told	 him	 in-between	 coughs.	 They	 made	 it	 halfway	 to	 the	 room before	she	collapsed	onto	the	floor	and	passed	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>Al	could	barely	see,	but	he	picked	her	up	and	rushed	back	to	the	airlock	and handed	her	to	the	last	of	the	evacuees.	He	pointed	to	one	of	them	and	said,	“Give me	 your	 shirt.	 I	 need	 something	 to	 wrap	 around	 my	 face.”	 He	 held	 the	 man’s shirt	up	to	his	mouth	and	went	back	to	try	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	ran	to	the	other	end	of	the	corridor	and	realized	the	shirt	was	not	needed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	seemed	to	be	breathing	just	fine.	When	he	reached	the	power	room,	he	found</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	 three	 airtight	 doors	 standing	 wide	 open,	 blocked	 from	 closing.  <i class="calibre4">That	 is	 not</i> <i class="calibre4">supposed	to	happen. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">He	crouched	as	he	entered	the	room,	and	tried	to	discover	the	reason	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">smoke	 and	 alarms.	 In	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 chamber,	 a	 console	 of	 large	 circuit breakers	was	engulfed	in	flames.	Al	knew	the	fire	system	couldn’t	operate	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	doors	open.	If	he	can	close	the	doors,	it	might	activate	the	system	and	allow it	to	extinguish	the	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	crawled	to	the	nearest	door	and	gave	it	a	solid	push.	Nothing	happened.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 getting	 increasingly	 difficult	 to	 see,	 and	 the	 reason	 it	 wouldn’t	 close	 was hard	to	determine.	He	pushed	again—only	with	more	force.	Something	popped</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	the	bottom	of	the	door,	and	it	reluctantly	closed.	He	pushed	firmly	on	the	other two	open	barriers,	and	they	too	swung	shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 slipped	 out	 of	 the	 room	 as	 the	 last	 door	 closed,	 and	 was	 relieved	 to	 see the	fire	system	activate	and	empty	the	room	of	air.	Fans	came	on	in	the	corridor, and	the	air	began	to	clear.	As	fast	as	it	started,	the	crisis	ended. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	hurried	down	the	hallway	entering	living	quarters	looking	for	casualties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside	 the	 door	 of	 one	 apartment,	 he	 found	 a	 little	 girl	 lying	 on	 the	 floor unconscious.	Quickly,	he	picked	her	up	and	carried	her	to	the	airlock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 he	 walked	 out	 of	 the	 airlock,	 all	 smoky	 and	 dirty	 holding	 that	 little girl,	 the	 entire	 corridor	 full	 of	 people	 burst	 into	 applause.	 The	 parents	 took	 her and	 were	 standing	 there	 in	 tears,	 thanking	 him	 over	 and	 over.	 Al	 thought,  <i class="calibre4">that</i> <i class="calibre4">worked	out	well,	and	nobody	suspects	I	am	more	than	I	appear. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 much	 recovered	 Liz	 took	 his	 arm	 as	 they	 left	 the	 crowd,	 and	 she	 walked him	 to	 her	 quarters.	 She	 left	 him	 to	 recover	 and	 get	 cleaned	 up	 while	 she returned	to	assess	the	damage.	Chris	was	there	when	they	arrived,	and	she	filled him	in	on	Al’s	heroic	deeds	before	she	grabbed	a	flashlight	and	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	asked,	“Are	you	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	all	right;	there	wasn’t	much	to	it,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	according	to	my	mother.	She	made	it	sound	like	you	saved	the	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really,	Chris,	it	was	nothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 young	 man	 was	 aware	 they	 had	 a	 saboteur,	 and	 it	 raised	 a	 logical question,	“How	do	you	think	it	started?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>Al	 told	 him	 what	 he	 discovered.	 “Someone	 blocked	 all	 the	 doors	 open	 and set	a	fire.	It	was	sabotage—no	doubt	about	it.	We	need	to	catch	this	guy	before he	starts	killing	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	already	has.	A	girl	died	a	little	while	ago	from	drinking	the	water.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	only	twelve	years	old.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	Al	was	saving	one	girl,	another	had	died. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 getting	 angry,	 and	 he	 didn’t	 understand	 how	 anyone	 could	 hurt people	 on	 purpose.	 “I	 need	 to	 get	 back	 to	 the	 scene	 of	 the	 fire	 and	 see	 if	 I	 can help.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	got	up	and	went	to	the	kitchen	to	clean	up.	Chris	went	to	Al’s	quarters	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	 him	 some	 clean	 clothes	 and	 half	 an	 hour	 later;	 Al	 was	 going	 back	 to	 the power	room	to	talk	with	his	men	already	there.	His	problems	would	have	to	wait. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	power	room	looked	bad.	Liz	told	him	it	would	have	been	a	lot	worse	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 had	 not	 put	 the	 fire	 out.	 She	 was	 busy	 reading	 schematics	 on	 her	 pad, throwing	switches,	and	resetting	breakers	to	try	to	reroute	and	restore	power.	It was	 a	 high	 voltage	 primary	 breaker	 that	 exploded,	 and	 the	 debris	 was	 strewn everywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 men	 were	 off	 to	 the	 side	 using	 their	 pads	 to	 review	 the	 camera	 video from	the	room	before	the	fire	started,	and	they	got	lucky.	The	person	responsible had	known	where	all	the	cameras	were—except	one.	This	one	camera	recorded	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">slight	 figure	 in	 a	 big	 hurry	 to	 weld	 the	 doors	 open.	 At	 one	 point,	 the	 figure looked	around,	and	they	got	a	full	view	of	the	face.	It	was	the	face	of	a	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Why	do	people	automatically	assume	saboteurs	are	men? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Run	that	through	the	computer	and	see	if	we	can	get	a	name,”	Al	instructed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	them	exclaimed,	“I	think	I	know	her,	she	works	in	the	shuttle	bay	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 night	 shift.	 She’s	 a	 bit	 of	 a	 loner	 that	 stays	 to	 herself,	 but	 I	 always	 thought she	was	just	shy.	We	should	talk	to	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 were	 just	 given	 a	 gift,	 gentlemen.	 A	 clear	 image	 of	 the	 person	 that blocked	 those	 doors,	 and	 probably	 started	 the	 fire.	 Let’s	 not	 waste	 our	 gift. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Please,	let's	get	this	done,	I	would	like	to	talk	to	this	person	within	the	hour.	Let me	know	when	you	have	her	in	custody.”	They	hesitated,	and	he	reiterated,	“Go</p>
<p class="calibre1">on—get	going.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz	was	leaning	over	a	bank	of	breakers	close	to	where	the	fire	had	been	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	pulling	on	something.	Al	walked	over	to	assist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Need	some	help?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz	looked	up	and	smiled,	“As	a	matter	of	fact,	I	can’t	get	this	panel	to	break loose.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here,	let	me	see.”	Al	reached	over	and	saw	her	hand	on	a	handle.	“It	pulls</p>
<p class="calibre1">straight	out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a>“It’s	supposed	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	grabbed	the	handle	and	carefully	pulled,	trying	not	to	have	it	fly	out	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">bounce	 against	 the	 wall;	 he	 increased	 the	 pressure	 until	 it	 broke	 loose	 and	 slid open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 are	 my	 hero	 for	 the	 second	 time	 today.	 I	 should	 ask	 you	 to	 dinner	 or something,”	she	suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,	but	I	still	have	things	to	do.	I’ll	take	a	rain	check,	though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz	 got	 an	 inquisitive	 look	 on	 her	 face,	 “What	 did	 you	 and	 the	 captain	 talk about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	it's	top	secret.	Need	to	know	and	all	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	laughed,	“I’ll	get	it	out	of	you,	just	not	right	now.	I	have	to	get	the	power back	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Need	anything	else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I’m	good.	I	should	be	finished	here	in	an	hour	or	two.	Maybe	I’ll	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	regret,	Al	replied,	“I	don’t	think	I’ll	have	time	tonight,	and	I	go	back	to the	 surface	 in	 the	 morning.	 I	 expect	 to	 be	 interrogating	 the	 person	 that	 did	 this shortly.	Maybe	we	can	stop	this	lunacy	before	it	gets	any	worse.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hope	you	can	stop	it	before	more	people	get	killed.	If	you	come	up	here</p>
<p class="calibre1">again	before	I	come	down,	give	me	a	call.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	said	their	goodbyes	and	Al	left	to	head	for	the	security	office.	A	couple</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	people	acknowledged	him	on	his	way	and	shook	his	hand,	saying	things	like, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Way	 to	 go	 Chief.”	 and	 “Nice	 job.”	 He	 was	 embarrassed	 and	 dismissive.	 He didn’t	think	of	himself	as	a	hero.	Still,	he	had	to	admit	it	 <i class="calibre4">did</i>	feel	good. </p><p class="calibre1">

WHEN	 THEY	 BROUGHT	 HER	 in,	 she	 was	 small	 like	 Ana,	 but	 not	 like	 Ana. <p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">This	girl	did	not	have	the	advantages	that	Ana	had	been	born	with,	and	it	showed in	 her	 demeanor.	 Her	 name	 was	 Tammy	 Shoemaker,	 and	 she	 was	 a	 young	 girl under	twenty;	now	a	scared	and	fidgety	bird	in	a	trap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tammy	hid	her	fear	with	anger	at	the	officers	that	held	her	arms	and	guided</p>

<p class="calibre1">Al	 watched	 from	 his	 desk	 without	 saying	 a	 word,	 trying	 to	 get	 a	 handle	 on how	to	deal	with	her.	They	put	her	in	the	cell	and	locked	the	door,	leaving	her alone	and	in	a	lot	of	trouble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	me	out	of	here.	I	haven’t	done	anything.	I	demand	you	let	me	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>She	suddenly	realized	that	they	did	not	particularly	care	what	she	had	to	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	look	in	their	eyes	told	her	they	didn’t	care	for	her	at	all.	She	threw	herself onto	the	bunk	and	sat	there	in	defiance;	trying	unsuccessfully	to	hide	her	fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tammy	had	long	brown	hair	and	a	pixie	face	with	a	turned	up	nose	and	green</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes.	She	had	on	the	dirty	uniform	of	a	maintenance	worker	that	did	little	to	hide a	small,	slender	frame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	did	you	find	her,”	Al	asked	his	officer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	 was	 in	 her	 quarter’s	 sir,	 getting	 ready	 to	 take	 a	 shower.	 I	 think	 we surprised	 her.	 There	 was	 a	 portable	 welding	 set-up	 in	 her	 closet	 and	 some chemical	containers	that	she	could	have	added	to	the	water.	They	are	analyzing	it now.	Fingerprints	and	DNA	are	also	in	the	process.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al,	the	man	responsible	for	all	the	settler’s	safety,	watched	his	prisoner.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">continued	to	keep	his	eyes	on	her	as	he	grabbed	a	chair,	set	it	down	backward	in front	of	the	cell,	and	wrapped	his	arms	around	the	seatback.	The	girl	had	grown quiet	and	was	staring	at	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">She	must	realize	they	would	charge	her	with	endangering	the	lives	of	all	on</i> <i class="calibre4">board—and	possibly	murder.	What	would	make	someone	do	something	like	this? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	sat	watching	her	for	a	while	in	thought.	He	forced	a	reasonable	tone	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	voice	and	asked,	“When	a	crazy	person	does	something	especially	nuts,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	question	normal	people	are	left	with	is—why?	Why	would	you	do	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	hesitated	for	a	second	and	then	raised	her	head.	Defiantly	she	exclaimed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	not	crazy.	I	am	here	to	stop	you.	You	have	no	right	to	steal	someone	else’s planet.	You	ruin	your	own	world,	and	then	build	big	ships	to	go	out	and	destroy other	 people’s	 worlds.	 This	 mission	 is	 what	 I	 was	 destined	 to	 give	 my	 life	 for, and	I	only	wish	I	was	better	at	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	was	stunned.	He	did	not	need	to	ask	more	questions.	The	hatred	apparent</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 her	 face	 made	 him	 believe	 this	 girl	 was	 likely	 the	 product	 of	 highly radicalized	thinking.	What	kind	of	life	must	she	have	endured	for	her	to	think	as she	does? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	struck	him	that	she	might	be	a	victim	of	chance;	wrong	place,	wrong	time, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 the	 wrong	 people.	 Al’s	 anger	 turned	 to	 frustration	 when	 he	 realized	 her misguided	beliefs	might	not	be	entirely	her	fault.	These	were	the	twisted	views of	 humans	 that	 taught	 terrorism,	 and	 a	 fervent	 cause,	 put	 forth	 properly,	 can become	overwhelming.	Punishing	her	would	change	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	decided	to	change	his	tactics.	“Are	you	hungry,	or	thirsty?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	could	use	a	plate	of	freedom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,	can’t	do	that.	You’ll	stay	where	you	are	until	we	can	figure	out	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	do	with	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>Al	stood	up	and	returned	the	chair	to	its	place	by	the	desk.	He	motioned	to Sid,	the	senior	officer,	to	move	out	of	the	girls	hearing	and	told	him,	“Sid,	I	want you	to	make	sure	she	gets	some	psychiatric	help.	That	is	one	mixed	up	kid.	I’m</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Will	do	Chief.	Have	a	safe	trip	tomorrow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	went	back	to	his	quarters.	It	was	late,	and	he	was	tired.	Even	though	he</p>

<p class="calibre1">always	ended	at	the	same	point.	He	was	standing	on	a	grassy	hill	looking	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 a	 village,	 with	 a	 person	 running	 towards	 him	 yelling	 something	 he	 couldn’t quite	understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	woke	up	confused,	with	the	images	fresh	in	his	mind,	and	then	the	dream</p>
<p class="calibre1">faded	 away,	 leaving	 only	 small	 snippets	 of	 the	 whole.	 There	 were,	 however, fragments	that	remained	in	his	memory.	He	remembered	it	made	him	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	left	his	quarters	early	and	made	his	way	directly	to	the	hangar	bay	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 robotics	 repair	 shop	 was	 located.	 He	 approached	 the	 door	 to	 the	 sound	 of music.	Inside,	a	group	was	performing	an	old	song	Al	found	vaguely	familiar—</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	about	a	silver	hammer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 entered	 the	 room	 and	 closed	 the	 door	 behind	 him.	 The	 music	 was	 loud, and	 the	 smell	 of	 oil	 and	 plastic	 permeated	 the	 shop.	 A	 short,	 wild-haired	 man stood	 on	 a	 table	 with	 one	 of	 the	 gardening	 robots	 lying	 beneath	 him.	 He	 was singing	along	with	the	band	and	preparing	to	swing	a	large	silver	hammer	at	its round	silver	head	when	Al	interrupted,	“Hey...it	looks	to	me	like	he	gave	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	white	haired	man	jumped	and	turned	to	determine	where	the	voice	came</p>
<p class="calibre1">from,	“Well...hello	there,	Sheriff.	I	wasn’t	expecting	anybody	this	early.	Grab	a seat;	I’ll	be	right	with	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 watched	 as	 he	 set	 his	 hammer	 down	 and	 climbed	 down	 from	 the	 table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Short,	and	older,	he	was	a	man	of	fifty	or	so,	with	an	energetic	face,	unruly	long white	hair,	and	bright	blue	eyes.	He	wore	a	long	white	coat	with	more	than	a	few oily	stains. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 roboticist	 went	 to	 a	 small	 tablet	 and	 turned	 his	 music	 down,	 wiped	 his hands	 with	 a	 cloth,	 and	 walked	 over	 to	 where	 Al	 was	 standing.	 His	 coat	 had	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>name	tag	on	it	that	said,	Dr.	Edward	Florida. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hope	you	don’t	misunderstand	what	I	was	doing	just	then,”	he	asked.	“To</p>
<p class="calibre1">remove	that	robots	head,	you	have	to	strike	a	particular	spot	with	sufficient	force to	dislodge	it	from	the	body.	I	find	it	easier	to	be	overhead.”	He	offered	his	hand and	said,	“Pleasure	to	meet	you,	Mister	Clark.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	they	shook	hands,	Al	asked,	“You	know	who	I	am?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everyone	 knows	 who	 Chief	 Al	 Clark	 is.	 You’re	 making	 quite	 a	 name	 for yourself	 in	 our	 little	 community.	 My	 understanding	 is	 you’ve	 already	 saved several	lives.	Is	that	not	so?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	lucky	enough	to	be	in	the	right	place	at	the	right	time.	I	think	fortune smiled	on	me,”	was	Al’s	humble	reply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nevertheless,	 Mister	 Clark,	 you	 are	 well	 known	 in	 these	 parts	 and	 highly respected.	What	can	I	do	for	you	this	fine	day?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 considered	 how	 to	 continue.	 He	 needed	 someone	 who	 knew	 about	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">human	brain	and	robot	combination,	and	someone	versed	in	this	field	that	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">decipher	the	manual	the	captain	possessed.	Still,	he	needed	to	be	discreet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	replied,	“You	too,	Doctor	Florida,	are	also	highly	respected.	I’ve	done	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	 checking	 on	 you,	 and	 learned	 you	 are	 both	 a	 doctor	 and	 a	 roboticist; regarded	by	some	to	be	one	of	the	best	in	both	fields.	Can	I	ask	why	it	is	that	you are	down	here,	in	the	back	end	of	the	ship	repairing	maintenance	robots?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doctor	 Florida	 chuckled,	 “If	 you	 mean	  <i class="calibre4">why	 </i> I	 am	 here	 on	 this	 vessel,	 it’s because	 robotics	 became	 too	 restrictive	 on	 Earth.	 I	 have	 interests	 they	 did	 not appreciate.	If	you	mean	why	I	am	 <i class="calibre4">here</i>	repairing	robots,	it’s	because	somebody has	 to	 care	 for	 them	 and	 I	 enjoy	 it.	 Does	 that	 answer	 your	 question,	 Mister Clark?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 little	 chagrined,	 Al	 continued,	 “I’m	 told	 you	 are	 familiar	 with	 Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawthorn’s	work.	Is	this	true?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 doctor	 recognized	 the	 name	 immediately	 and	 was	 quick	 to	 answer, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doctor	 Hawthorn	 was	 a	 genius,	 a	 dreamer,	 and	 a	 revolutionary.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">combination	of	which	leads	to	amazing	discoveries.	He	was	a	visionary	when	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	to	robotics.	What	a	tragedy	it	is	that	he	didn’t	live	to	see	our	new	world.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	I	take	it	you	approved	of	his	work?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	 yes,	 he	 was	 doing	 some	 extraordinary	 work	 on	 human	 integration	 to robotic	constructs.	Unfortunately,	it	was	highly	controversial,	and	they	revoked his	 funding.	 That	 is	 the	 reason	 he	 joined	 our	 expedition.	 He	 hoped	 to	 continue his	research	here,	and	I	was	hoping	to	collaborate	with	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	doing	research	of	your	own	in	that	area?”	Al	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 was...but	 there	 hasn’t	 been	 much	 free	 time.	 Maybe	 later,	 once	 we	 are settled.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>Al	made	his	decision	to	get	some	professional	help.	They	were	alone	in	the small	room.	Several	closed	doors	led	to	other	areas	in	the	shop.	Just	to	be	sure, he	leaned	up	close	to	the	roboticist’s	ear	and	asked,	“Can	you	keep	a	secret?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doctor	 Florida	 said	 he	 could,	 and	 Al	 told	 him	 his	 story	 in	 an	 abbreviated form,	starting	with	waking	up	in	the	box	and	ending	with	his	experience	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">power	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	roboticist	was	surprised—and	then	delighted.	“You	are	the	prototype?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	the	flesh,	so	to	speak,”	Al	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doctor	Florida	was	not	so	surprised	that	he	didn’t	think	to	run	some	tests.	As</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	roboticist,	Al	was	like	finding	the	Holy	Grail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	go	into	the	diagnostic	room	so	I	can	examine	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	asked	Al	to	sit	on	a	table	and	knelt	down	to	look	at	his	wounded	leg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	healing	nicely,	in	a	couple	of	weeks	you	won’t	be	able	to	tell	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">injured,”	predicted	the	doctor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 took	 them	 several	 minutes	 to	 figure	 out	 how	 to	 open	 the	 access	 panel located	 on	 Al’s	 back.	 A	 tiny	 mole	 pressed	 just	 the	 right	 way	 opened	 a	 small panel,	and	allowed	the	roboticist	to	hook	up	his	equipment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah...ha,	 now	 we’re	 getting	 somewhere,”	 he	 exclaimed	 happily	 while	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">grabbed	 leads	 and	 plugged	 them	 into	 the	 proper	 ports	 of	 the	 scanner	 and	 Al’s back.	A	large	monitor	burst	into	life	and	displayed	the	workings	of	Al’s	body	in exquisite	detail.	Rods	and	tubes,	servos	and	motors,	things	that	Al	had	no	idea	of their	 purpose,	 and	 miles	 of	 intricate	 wiring.	 Lines	 of	 code,	 parameters,	 and status,	scrolled	down	both	sides	of	the	digital	representation	of	his	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	doctor	and	scientist	turned	to	Al	and	said,	“Now	that	is	a	thing	of	beauty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simple	and	elegant.	No	disrespect	intended.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“None	taken	Doc...is	everything	all	right?	Do	I	need	a	charge	or	anything?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	asked;	unsure	of	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everything	 is	 fine	 Chief	 Clark.	 See	 how	 your	 leg	 is	 getting	 extra	 fluids	 to help	it	regenerate	the	skin	structure.	I	know	your	power	pack	is	good	for	many</p>
<p class="calibre1">years	in	the	 <i class="calibre4">human</i>	mode,	and	it	appears	you	are	eating	and	drinking	enough	to maintain	 your	 biological	 aspects.	 No,	 I	 would	 say	 your	 body	 is	 fine,	 but	 how about	 the	 mental	 portion	 of	 your	 well-being?	 Are	 you	 sleeping	 well?	 Any depression	or	anxiety?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	been	getting	better	since	I	found	out	what	I	am.	In	the	beginning,	it	was kind	of	scary,”	admitted	Al. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“From	 what	 I’ve	 heard,	 I	 would	 say	 you’re	 adapting	 well	 to	 a	 challenging and	frightening	situation.	You	mentioned	a	manual	the	captain	has.	Can	I	get	my hands	on	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a>Doctor	Florida	was	licking	his	lips	and	rubbing	his	hands.	Begging	to	know Al	and	his	robotic	body	better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	grinned	at	the	image	this	mad	scientist	looking	man	made	and	answered</p>
<p class="calibre1">him,	“I	will	ask	the	captain	to	get	it	to	you.	You	must	remember,	though,	for	the time	 being...tell	 no	 one.	 The	 captain,	 Doctor	 Cody,	 and	 you	 are	 the	 only	 ones that	know.	If	anyone	else	needs	to	become	involved,	I	should	be	the	one	to	tell them.	Do	you	agree?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Absolutely.	 There	 are	 people	 in	 this	 camp	 that	 would	 not	 take	 kindly	 to having	a	cybernetic	person	among	them.	For	you	to	help	the	colonists,	you	must</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	liked	by	them.	I	totally	understand	why	you	want	to	keep	your	identity	secret. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	a	different	time,	I’d	tell	you	to	wear	a	mask.”	Edward	Florida	thought	that	was funny.	 “You	 could	 be	 the	 first	 superhero	 of	 Avalon.”	 The	 look	 he	 gave	 Al	 was one	of	mischief,	and	then	he	laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 had	 a	 bigger	 question,	 “What	 happens	 when	 you	 take	 me	 out	 of	  <i class="calibre4">human</i> mode?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	this	point,	I’m	not	sure.	I	assume	your	strength	and	speed	would	increase</p>
<p class="calibre1">substantially.	There	is	a	possibility	your	senses	will	be	better.	I	will	know	more after	 I	 get	 a	 look	 at	 Dr.	 Hawthorn’s	 manual.	 However,	 I	 don’t	 recommend	 you change	 that	 setting	 too	 soon.	 We	 need	 to	 do	 some	 systems	 tests	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">psychological	evaluations.	Let’s	take	it	slow	and	work	up	to	your	full	potential	in baby	steps.	I’m	not	sure	you	realize	this	yet,	but...you	can	be	a	very	dangerous man.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">The	shuttle	floated	down	from	the	clouds	to	an	expanding	settlement.	A	lot</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 happened	 to	 him	 in	 only	 one	 day.	 If	 you	 add	 the	 problems	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">experienced	last	night,	it	seemed	much	longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Al	stepped	from	the	shuttle,	there	were	one-hundred	and	three	people</p>
<p class="calibre1">working	on-planet	to	make	this	place	their	home.	Activity	surrounded	him	as	the colonist’s	rushed	to	get	settled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 late	 afternoon,	 and	 the	 sun	 was	 casting	 long	 shadows	 across	 the security	office	when	he	arrived.	Large	windows	in	each	wall	provided	plenty	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">light	for	their	needs.	Behind	a	curtain,	four	bunks	filled	half	the	habitat,	with	two tables	 and	 accompanying	 chairs	 filling	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 small	 office.	 Two	 of	 his men	 were	 sitting	 in	 chairs	 staring	 at	 two	 pads	 propped	 up	 on	 a	 table.	 Another officer	 returned	 in	 the	 same	 shuttle	 as	 Al	 and	 left	 for	 lunch.	 The	 rest	 were sleeping	behind	the	curtain	or	out	on	patrol. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 two	 men	 at	 the	 table	 were	 seeing	 through	 the	 Watcher’s	 eyes;	 reading the	 data	 their	 sensors	 generated.	 They	 were	 responsible	 for	 the	 vigil	 against dragons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have	you	seen	anything?”	their	boss	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 closest	 to	 Al	 took	 his	 eyes	 from	 the	 security	 pad	 and	 answered, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	was	a	smaller	creature	like	the	ones	that	attacked	us,	throwing	rocks	at	a fence	post	just	before	dawn.	He	didn’t	do	any	damage,	but	he	had	us	going	for	a while.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Watcher	one	saw	 two	giant	long-necked	 creatures	from	a	 distance	an	hour</p>
<p class="calibre1">ago.	It	was	triggered	by	the	noise	and	gave	us	twenty	seconds	of	video.	Want	to see	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,	these	are	our	neighbors.	We	should	learn	all	we	can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	video	was	sharp	and	clear	and	showed	two	giant	creatures	with	long	thin</p>
<p class="calibre1">necks	 two	 miles	 away,	 lumbering	 across	 the	 screen.	 They	 reminded	 him	 of pictures	from	a	book;	a	book	about	Earths	distant	past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	they	are	interested	in	us.	Still,	I’m	glad	they’re	way	out	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	remarked.	“Keep	your	eyes	open.	I’m	going	on	a	walkabout	and	talk	to	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">guys	later.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	walkabout	is	what	they	now	referred	to	as	their	informal	patrols.	They	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">walked—about.	Al	left	the	office	and	went	to	grab	something	to	eat.	He	had	not</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>eaten	anything	since	last	night,	and	although	his	stomach	could	not	growl,	he	felt his	hunger	as	a	fuzziness	of	thought	that	progressively	got	worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	mess	hall	was	a	large	tent	until	they	completed	the	permanent	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	picked	up	his	dinner	and	was	sitting	by	himself	at	a	table	when	Cody	came	in, looked	around	until	he	saw	Al,	and	made	his	way	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	you	are,”	he	said,	“How	are	you	doing	my	friend?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 doing	 all	 right,	 all	 in	 all.	 How	 about	 you?”	 Al	 replied	 with	 a	 little apprehension. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	fine...but	I	need	to	talk	to	you.	It	is	extremely	important.	Can	we	go	to the	clinic?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 was	 almost	 done	 eating	 his	 small	 meal,	 so	 he	 threw	 the	 remains	 in	 the trash	and	followed	the	doctor	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	the	matter,	Cody?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	will	show	you	when	we	get	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 arrived	 at	 the	 clinic	 and	 went	 directly	 to	 the	 diagnostic	 room.	 Cody locked	the	door	and	then	pulled	up	Al’s	scan	on	the	monitor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	and	said,	“You	have	a	hole	in	your	head.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Umm...excuse	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doctor	Cody	tapped	the	monitor	and	zoomed	in	on	the	forehead.	He	pointed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	a	tiny	dot.	A	dot	on	 <i class="calibre4">his</i>	forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	is	a	hole	in	the	metal	of	your	head.	My	scan	cannot	penetrate	the	metal</p>
<p class="calibre1">surrounding	 your	 brain,	 so	 I	 cannot	 see	 inside,	 but	 the	 scan	 shows	 a	 tiny	 hole. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Are	you	feeling	all	right?	Do	you	remember	banging	your	head? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	it	came	to	him.	Al	remembered	a	foggy	mirror	in	a	vacant	and	unused</p>
<p class="calibre1">bathroom	 and	 a	 tiny	 drop	 of	 blood	 on	 his	 forehead.	 He	 remembered	 a	 pinhole when	he	woke	up—in	the	lid	of	his	box,	and	the	holes	in	the	habitat	ring	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	micro-meteorites.	He	thought	of	the	dull	headaches	he’d	begun	to	have. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 mentioned	 all	 this	 to	 his	 friend	 and	 voiced	 his	 concern.	 “Is	 it	 possible	 I have	a	meteorite	fragment	in	my	head?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	friend	looked	worried,	“It	might	be.	We	will	need	to	do	more	tests.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	should	we	do?”	asked	Al. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	see	the	roboticist	while	you	were	aboard	the	Excalibur?	Did	he	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	scan?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	did	see	him,	and	he	performed	a	scan.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 download	 from	 his	 scan	 might	 tell	 us	 if	 you	 are	 in	 danger.	 His equipment	is	more	sophisticated	and	can	give	us	more	detail.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cody	 thought	 for	 a	 few	 seconds	 and	 considered	 the	 dangers	 involved	 with exposing	Al’s	secret	to	the	settlement,	“I	must	go	and	see	him	myself.	We	cannot trust	 the	 radio,	 so	 I	 must	 take	 a	 shuttle	 up	 to	 the	 ship.	 I	 will	 leave	 tomorrow</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>morning	and	be	back	the	next	day.	Until	I	return,	you	must	promise	me	you	will take	it	easy...yes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	had	many	questions.	The	one	that	jumped	out	immediately	was,	“Do	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">think	this	might	be	the	reason	for	my	amnesia?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	it	is	a	distinct	possibility,	my	friend.” </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
IT	WAS	DARK	OUTSIDE	 when	 he	 left	 the	 clinic.	 The	 settlement	 lights	 lit	 up the	night.	Still,	many	areas	were	left	in	dark	shadow.	Most	colonists	were	inside for	 supper	 or	 doing	 preparations	 for	 the	 next	 day’s	 work,	 and	 the	 colony	 had grown	quiet. <p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Al	was	in	a	mild	state	of	shock.	His	life	was	once	again	in	chaos,	and	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">unsure	 of	 his	 future.	 His	 headache	 was	 gone,	 and	 he	 felt	 fine,	 but	 he	 was	 not happy.	Waiting	for	Doc	Cody	to	return	was	going	to	be	difficult. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 night	 was	 the	 time	 of	 monsters.	 Al	 and	 his	 men	 had	 adopted	 the	 local name	 for	 the	 beasts,	 and	 when	 the	 sun	 went	 down,	 they	 knew	 the	 ‘Riktors’</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	be	hunting.	While	four	of	his	people	were	patrolling	the	camp,	two	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">monitored	the	feed	coming	from	the	watchers.	Sleep	was	something	done	during</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	decided	to	walk	the	fence	and	check	the	installation.	He	wanted	to	make</p>
<p class="calibre1">sure	it	was	working	as	intended.	Al	stopped	by	the	security	office	and	informed his	men.	Then	he	grabbed	a	powerful	flashlight	and	a	rifle—just	in	case	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 monsters	 was	 stupid	 enough	 to	 try	 something—and	 he	 left.	 His	 mood	 was such	that	he	almost	wished	they	would	try	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walking	 the	 fence	 was	 therapeutic.	 Insects	 buzzed,	 and	 animals	 called	 to each	other	in	voices	of	their	own.	The	noises	of	the	night	reminded	him	of	Earth on	 a	 pleasant	 spring	 evening.	 There	 were	 large	 versions	 of	 fireflies	 that	 dotted the	landscape,	their	tails	blinking	as	they	make	lazy	circles	in	the	air.	If	it	weren’t for	the	occasional	animal	scream	or	savage	growl	in	the	distance,	it	would	have been	more	relaxing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	perimeter	posts	that	generated	the	fence	were	designed	to	stun.	Now	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	his	flashlight	would	spotlight	some	creature	that	attempted	to	pass	through the	 invisible	 barrier.	 The	 paralyzing	 effect	 started	 at	 the	 bottom	 and	 got progressively	stronger	until	it	reached	the	ten-foot	level.	Sometimes,	a	creature stunned	 by	 the	 fence	 would	 wake	 up	 a	 half-hour	 later	 and	 go	 the	 wrong	 way; paralyzing	themselves	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 one	 section	 Al	 found	 evidence	 of	 a	 large	 animal	 that	 tried	 the	 fence, smashing	some	small	bushes	and	leaving	the	ground	marked	with	the	fall	of	its</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>body.	Further	down,	he	found	another	spot	where	it	attempted	to	break	through again.  <i class="calibre4">This	creature	is	persistent. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	reached	the	part	of	the	perimeter	furthest	from	the	main	camp	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">its	lights,	in	the	darkest	part	of	the	line	of	fence	poles,	he	found	a	hole	dug	under the	fence.	A	rather	large	hole	dug	hurriedly	since	sunset.	Claw	tracks	led	away from	the	hole,	headed	in	the	direction	of	Camelot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	have	an	intruder,”	Al	announced	over	the	radio.	“The	southwest	corner</p>
<p class="calibre1">fence	has	been	compromised,	and	tracks	lead	inbound.	If	it	is	a	Riktor,	remember</p>
<p class="calibre1">—they	may	hunt	in	pairs.	I	am	making	my	way	in	from	the	compromised	section</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	fence.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 could	 hear	 his	 men	 commanding	 everyone	 to	 get	 to	 the	 habitats	 as	 he followed	the	tracks	toward	town. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	a	tent	next	to	a	half-finished	habitat	module,	he	heard	someone	screaming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 flashlight	 beam	 lit	 the	 back	 of	 an	 angry	 monster,	 at	 least	 eight	 foot	 tall, dragging	a	woman	out	through	a	tear	in	the	tent.	He	had	her	by	the	legs	with	his front	 claws	 and	 was	 pulling	 her	 from	 the	 safety	 of	 her	 home.	 She	 was	 kicking and	screaming	and	doing	her	best	to	make	his	intentions	difficult. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 looked	 around	 for	 an	 accomplice	 and	 didn’t	 see	 one.	 It	 appeared	 to	 be alone.	He	yelled,	“Hey—over	here!”	It	was	crucial	he	get	the	creature	away	from the	 woman.	 A	 man	 ran	 out	 through	 the	 tent	 flap	 and	 helped	 to	 distract	 the determined	Riktor,	and	to	his	credit,	the	man	was	a	fast	runner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	monster	turned	his	attention	to	Al.	One	of	his	officers	appeared	twenty</p>
<p class="calibre1">feet	 to	 his	 side	 and	 followed	 the	 Chief’s	 example.	 In	 a	 rage,	 the	 beast	 looked back	and	forth	trying	to	decide	which	human	to	attack.	Both	men	began	moving</p>
<p class="calibre1">backward,	attempting	to	draw	it	away	from	the	tent	and	the	victim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Riktor	dropped	the	woman,	and	she	jumped	up	and	ran	to	safety.	Then	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">started	moving	towards	them	roaring	his	displeasure.	As	the	creature	moved	out, the	two	men	circled	slowly	around	to	get	a	clear	line	of	fire.	When	the	time	was right,	Al	screamed,	“Fire!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	monster	was	no	match	for	the	laser	rifles;	set	to	maximum;	they	almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">cut	him	in	half.	His	final	roar	died	in	his	throat,	and	he	fell	hard	to	the	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 was	 running	 over	 to	 check	 on	 the	 woman	 when	 the	 second	 Riktor</p>
<p class="calibre1">exploded	from	behind	a	neighboring	habitat	not	twenty	feet	away.	With	an	ear-</p>
<p class="calibre1">splitting	 roar,	 it	 thundered	 toward	 Al.	 He	 had	 no	 time	 to	 think.	 There	 was nothing	else	he	could	do	but	let	instinct	take	over,	and	he	fell	onto	his	back	to	the dirt.	The	surprised	beast	flew	over	him,	and	the	beam	from	Al’s	rifle	opened	it up.	The	first	monster’s	partner	dropped	to	the	dirt	in	a	heap	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	is	how	Al	got	his	fourth	Riktor.	He	was	a	hero	to	the	colonist’s—again, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	now	a	mortal	enemy	of	the	surviving	beasts. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>****</p>
<p class="calibre1">IT	 WASN’T	 LONG	 AFTER	 the	 battle	 that	 his	 headache	 returned.	 It	 started	 at annoying	 and	 moved	 towards	 just	 bearable	 within	 an	 hour.	 Eventually,	 it progressed	 to	 the	 point	 where	 he	 was	 forced	 to	 excuse	 himself	 and	 went	 to	 lie down.	 In	 the	 security	 quarters,	 he	 dropped	 into	 one	 of	 the	 bunks	 and	 promptly fell	asleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 dream	 was	 incredibly	 real	 this	 time.	 Al	 could	 smell	 the	 grass,	 hear	 the wind,	 and	 see	 for	 miles	 over	 the	 bright	 and	 beautiful	 countryside.	 The	 person running	up	the	hill	was	still	fuzzy.	As	she	got	closer	her	dress	turned	blue,	and she	 looked	 vaguely	 familiar.	 Whatever	 it	 was	 she	 was	 trying	 to	 tell	 him	 never became	clear	enough	to	understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 awoke	 six	 hours	 later	 with	 only	 a	 trace	 of	 the	 pain,	 and	 bright	 sunshine shone	 through	 glowing	 orange	 curtains.	 Al	 did	 not	 move	 right	 away; </p>
<p class="calibre1">contemplating	his	headache	and	the	reason	behind	it.	He	concluded	stress	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	headaches	worse,	and	it	was	something	he	needed	to	avoid.	He	got	up	hoping</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 could	 catch	 Cody	 before	 he	 left	 and	 let	 him	 know	 about	 the	 newest developments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	doctor	was	already	gone	when	Al	reached	the	shuttle	pads,	and	he	told</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself	it	was	just	as	well.	Doc	Cody	looked	worried	enough	when	he	last	saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 opted	 to	 stay	 busy.	 There	 were	 fences	 that	 needed	 reinforcing.	 He	 had excavators	dig	a	ten-foot	trench	six	inches	wide	between	each	post,	and	then	the machine	 filled	 the	 channels	 with	 a	 fast	 drying	 polymer	 that	 dried	 harder	 than concrete.	 A	 deep	 tunnel	 would	 have	 to	 be	 dug	 to	 get	 under	 the	 fence,	 and	 Al supervised	the	entire	thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	the	machines	did	most	of	the	work,	all	he	had	to	do	was	make	sure	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fence	posts	were	not	damaged.	His	men	took	responsibility	for	the	security	of	the town	when	it	became	apparent	Al	was	struggling	with	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	finishing	up	and	taking	care	of	last	minute	details	when	he	saw	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shuttle	touch	down	in	the	late	afternoon	the	following	day.	Al	made	his	way	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	shuttle	pad	and	watched	as	Doc	Cody,	followed	closely	by	Edward	Florida, </p>
<p class="calibre1">stepped	quickly	over	to	Al. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cody	wasted	no	time	with	small	talk	and	told	him	straight	away,	“You	need</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 come	 back	 to	 the	 ship.	 We	 need	 to	 run	 some	 tests,	 but	 it	 appears	 you	 need surgery.	 Dr.	 Florida	 has	 detected	 some	 swelling	 of	 your	 brain,	 which	 is	 more than	likely	causing	your	headaches.	We	need	to	remove	the	meteoroid	fragment</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	soon	as	possible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a>“Are	 you	 telling	 me	 I	 need	 brain	 surgery?”	 Al	 had	 avoided	 considering	 the idea.	Brain	surgery	was	something	he	thought	of	as	dangerous,	painful,	and	with terrible	odds	of	success. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doctor	Florida	wanted	 somewhere	more	private,	 so	they	went	 to	the	clinic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	inside,	with	the	doors	locked	and	the	curtains	drawn,	his	friends	attempted to	console	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 not	 as	 bad	 as	 it	 sounds,”	 said	 Edward.	 “We	 simply	 have	 to	 make	 an incision	around	the	head	and	get	access	to	the	brain	pan	cover.	Lift	the	lid,	and we	can	then	remove	the	meteoroid	and	prevent	further	damage.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	did	not	like	the	sound	of	any	of	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	tried	some	humor,	“I	feel	much	better	now,	maybe	it	will	go	away	on	its</p>
<p class="calibre1">own.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cody	told	him,	“This	will	only	get	worse,	my	friend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doc	 Cody	 was	 concerned	 and	 was	 afraid	 Al	 was	 running	 out	 of	 time.	 He agreed	with	Edward	and	wanted	to	perform	the	operation	without	delay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	knew	he	had	no	choice,	and	gave	in.	“All	right.	How	will	this	work?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cody	and	Edward	glanced	at	one	another,	each	in	silent	agreement,	and	Cody</p>
<p class="calibre1">explained,	“We	will	have	to	perform	the	surgery	on	the	ship	in	doctor	Florida’s diagnostic	room.	I	will	make	the	incision	to	open	the	cover,	and	Ed	will	remove the	 fragment.	 Then	 we	 just	 close	 the	 cover	 and	 stitch	 the	 incision.	 You	 will	 be right	as	rain	in	no	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 not	 going	 to	 walk	 around	 like	 Frankenstein	 and	 make	 grunting	 noises am	I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	Al,	you	should	take	this	seriously,”	pleaded	Cody. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	electricity	to	the	temples	or	anything	like	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Al...please,”	begged	Cody. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	gave	them	a	grin	and	said,	“All	right	already.	When	do	we	leave?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pack	yourself	a	bag	and	be	prepared	to	be	gone	for	a	week	or	so.	We	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">permission	to	use	a	shuttle,	and	we	leave	in	thirty	minutes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cody	 turned	 and	 started	 filling	 a	 suitcase	 with	 what	 he	 thought	 he	 might need	from	the	clinic.	Doctor	Florida	studied	Al’s	scan	while	Al	went	to	pack	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bag	 and	 let	 his	 men	 know	 he	 was	 leaving.	 He	 made	 a	 quick	 trip	 to	 his	 tiny sleeping	quarters,	and	the	security	shack,	and	ten	minutes	later	they	were	on	the shuttle	and	headed	to	the	Excalibur. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 captain	 met	 them	 on	 the	 hangar	 floor	 of	 the	 ship	 and	 escorted	 them directly	to	the	robotics	shop.	“Good	luck	Mister	Clark,	just	listen	to	the	doctors and	everything	will	be	all	right.	Don’t	worry—we’ll	take	care	of	everything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	to	Edward	and	asked	to	be	kept	informed,	posted	a	guard	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">outside	door,	and	left	to	attend	to	his	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>Inside	 the	 room,	 they	 ran	 some	 tests,	 and	 when	 they	 were	 ready,	 they	 had him	 step	 into	 a	 tube	 recessed	 into	 the	 floor	 that	 placed	 his	 head	 at	 shoulder height.	They	then	filled	it	with	a	special	foam	that	immobilized	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Edward,	 the	 not	 always	 funny	 roboticist,	 would	 have	 put	 it	 like	 this.	 “We locked	him	down,	opened	his	lid,	removed	a	grain	of	metal,	and	closed	him	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	 that	 it	 was	 quite	 that	 simple,	 but	 the	 operation	 did	 go	 pretty	 much according	 to	 plan.	 Two	 hours	 later,	 Al	 was	 sleeping	 comfortably	 in	 a	 recovery bed.	 The	 doctors	 were	 standing	 to	 the	 side	 discussing	 their	 friend	 and	 the operation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	think	he	will	be	okay	Edward?”	asked	Cody. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	never	know	with	brain	injuries.	The	connection	to	the	body	is	complex</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	delicate.	We	can	only	hope	he	does	not	become	worse.	I	don’t	think	we	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	damage,	though,	because	the	foreign	matter	came	out	so	easily.	I	am	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">optimistic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cody	asked	the	question	Al	had	asked,	“You	are	a	robotic	specialist	and	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 some	 time	 to	 go	 over	 Al’s	 operational	 manual.	 Can	 you	 tell	 me	 what	 his capabilities	will	be	when	he	recovers	fully?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 a	 seriousness	 that	 surprised	 Cody,	 Edward	 replied,	 “Without</p>
<p class="calibre1">restrictions,	 he	 could	 be	 almost	 unstoppable.	 The	 documentation	 describes abilities	far	above	a	normal	human.	He	could	be	the	very	thing	that	allows	us	to remain	here.	On	the	other	hand,	there	are	those	that	will	fear	him,	and	they	may try	to	cause	him	harm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doctor	Edward	Florida	 <i class="calibre4">had</i>	read	the	manual	and	had	a	pretty	good	idea	what Al	could	do	when	unrestricted.	What	he	knew	of	Al	as	a	person—made	him	feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">better	about	it. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
AL	 CLARK	 WOKE	 UP	 THREE	 days	 later;	 if	 it	 can	 be	 called	 waking	 up.	 He tried	 to	 open	 his	 eyes	 and	 couldn’t.	 He	 was	 awake;	 yet	 not	 awake,	 and	 could neither	see	nor	hear	anything	other	than	an	annoying	ringing	in	his	head.	With	no input	 from	 the	 outside	 world,	 Al	 was	 trapped	 inside	 his	 own	 head.	 Recent memories	 flooded	 back	 and	 he	 remembered	 the	 surgery.  <i class="calibre4">Had	 something	 gone</i> <i class="calibre4">wrong? </i><p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Al’s	 old	 friend	 Mister	 Fear	 knocked	 loudly	 at	 the	 door.  <i class="calibre4">Was	 this	 the	 way	 it</i> <i class="calibre4">was	going	to	be	from	now	on—had	the	surgery	caused	him	to	lose	the	use	of	his</i> <i class="calibre4">body? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a>Dr.	Edward	Florida	walked	into	the	room,	looked	at	a	monitor	for	a	moment, flicked	 a	 couple	 of	 switches	 on	 the	 machine	 hooked	 to	 the	 half	 human,	 half robot,	 and	 brought	 Al	 back	 to	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 world.	 His	 machine	 body reconnected	to	his	human	brain,	and	Al	was	alive	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 opened	 his	 eyes	 to	 the	 whisper	 of	 machines	 and	 fans	 flooding	 his	 ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Standing	 next	 to	 him	 was	 a	 smiling	 Doctor	 Florida,	 and	 at	 the	 foot	 of	 his	 bed, was	the	captain	and	Doc	Cody;	also	smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome	back	Mister	Clark,”	the	captain	said.	“You	had	us	worried.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	tried	moving	his	legs	to	sit	up	and	couldn’t.	He	attempted	raising	his	arm</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	had	the	same	lack	of	response.	“I	can’t	move.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t	worry	Al;	I	have	the	rest	of	your	body	shut	down.	I	wanted	your	brain</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 get	 a	 chance	 to	 rest	 without	 the	 added	 stimulus.	 How	 do	 you	 feel?”	 the roboticist	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	little	groggy.	Other	than	that...I	feel	okay.	There	is	a	buzzing	in	my	head.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 roboticist	 answered,	 “That	 is	 probably	 the	 feedback	 from	 your	 body being	disabled.	It	will	go	away	when	I	restart	the	rest	of	you.	Try	and	take	it	easy Al,	everything	is	going	to	be	fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	long	have	I	been	out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cody	spoke	up,	“We	have	been	giving	you	a	chemical	to	induce	sleep,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’ve	been	asleep	for	three	days,	but	everything	we	have	seen	so	far	points	to	a full	recovery.”	With	a	big	grin	on	his	face,	he	added,	“You	are	going	to	be	good as	gold	my	friend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">During	his	recovery,	Al’s	friends	came	to	see	him.	One	or	two	at	a	time.	As	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cover	 story,	 they	 were	 told	 he	 had	 a	 small	 brain	 tumor	 that	 was	 successfully removed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	good	to	see	Liz	and	Chris,	who	were	happily	preparing	to	move	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	Avalon.	They	were	excited	because	living	on	a	spaceship	was	no	comparison</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	living	on	a	living,	breathing	planet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kayla	and	Ana	came	by	and	brought	books	and	flowers.	They	too	would	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	down	to	Avalon.	However,	they	were	more	scared	than	excited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kayla	 explained	 their	 apprehension,	 “You’ve	 had	 to	 kill	 four	 of	 those creatures.	That	sounds	like	a	dangerous	place	to	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Someone	 told	 me	 they	 dragged	 a	 lady	 right	 out	 of	 her	 tent.	 Did	 that happen?”	asked	Ana. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 shrugged	 and	 tried	 to	 reassure	 them.	 “Yes	 that’s	 true,	 but	 she	 was	 only scratched.	We	do	have	some	things	to	work	out.	We’ll	improve	the	fence	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">overall	security	procedures,	and	the	settlement	will	become	safer.	With	the	help of	 the	 natives,	 we	 might	 be	 able	 to	 solve	 the	 Riktor	 problem	 altogether.	 It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>possible	that	after	losing	so	many	of	their	own,	the	creatures	will	decide	we’re not	worth	the	trouble	and	just	leave	us	alone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	think	so?”	asked	Ana. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No...It	 is,	 however,	 a	 nice	 thought.	 Don’t	 worry	 you	 two;	 we	 will	 keep perfecting	our	defenses	and	find	ways	to	keep	everyone	safe.	Trust	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	week	went	by	uneventfully.	Al’s	closest	friends	were	his	only	visitors,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	was	rare.	Most	of	the	time	he	was	bored	to	tears.	His	surgery	was	still	on	a <i class="calibre4">need	 to	 know	 </i> basis <i class="calibre4">, </i>	 so	 most	 people	 had	 no	 idea	 what	 happened	 to	 him.	 The people	 on	 the	 planet	 were	 made	 to	 believe	 he	 was	 assigned	 to	 the	 ship temporarily,	 and	 the	 people	 on	 the	 ship	 were	 made	 to	 believe	 he	 was	 still	 on Avalon.	Al	just	disappeared	into	the	robot	shop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 spent	 most	 of	 his	 time	 on	 paperwork	 pertaining	 to	 his	 profession, listening	 to	 Edward	 Florida’s	 music,	 and	 reading	 books.	 On	 the	 eighth	 day,	 he was	smuggled	out	and	returned	to	Camelot.	The	captain	cleared	the	hangar	bay, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 the	 patient	 was	 ushered	 out	 directly	 onto	 a	 shuttle	 that	 took	 him	 home; landing	 shortly	 before	 sunrise.	 From	 there	 it	 was	 a	 short	 walk	 to	 the	 security office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	settlement	had	changed	considerably.	It	was	more	than	a	camp	now	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">growing	 rapidly	 into	 a	 village.	 Dozens	 of	 habitat	 buildings	 placed	 beside	 wide sawdust	 sidewalks,	 with	 larger	 buildings	 under	 constructed	 for	 common	 use, were	 being	 prepared	 for	 habitation.	 Some	 settlers	 had	 already	 started	 to	 adapt their	 homes	 to	 their	 personal	 preferences,	 and	 a	 few	 houses	 had	 sapling	 trees planted	in	the	small	front	yards.	To	Al,	it	seemed	an	excellent	beginning	for	the time	they’d	been	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz	 suggested	 he	 wear	 a	 hat	 to	 hide	 his	 bandaged	 head.	 He	 had	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">preference,	and	it	sounded	like	a	nice	change,	so	he	had	a	cowboy	hat	made.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	wearing	that	hat	when	he	walked	into	the	office	and	surprised	his	deputies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well	howdy,	Sheriff.	What’s	with	the	hat?”	one	said	with	a	grin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	my	new	look,	what	do	ya	think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	looks	good	on	you,	and	makes	you	look	more...Sheriffy,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 were	 two	 men	 just	 finishing	 their	 overnight	 shift	 of	 monitoring	 the Watchers,	two	more	were	getting	dressed,	and	two	were	preparing	to	go	out	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">patrol.	Robot	Nine	was	already	out	checking	the	fence.	All	six	men	were	dying</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	know	what	had	happened	to	Al. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	had	to	have	a	little	surgery,”	he	told	them.	“Everything	is	fine,	and	I’ll	be back	to	normal	in	a	week	or	two.”	Al	didn’t	want	to	get	into	too	many	details,	so he	told	them	the	brain	tumor	story	and	brushed	off	the	rest	of	their	questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	sat	down	at	the	table	and	asked,	“So...what	did	I	miss	while	I	was	gone?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>Sid,	the	man	in	charge	in	his	absence	filled	him	in.	“Luckily,	we’ve	had	no Riktor	sightings	since	the	last	attack.	It	seems	we	might	have	scared	them	off	for the	 time	 being.”	 He	 paused	 to	 organize	 his	 thoughts.	 “The	 twelve-year-old	 girl that	was	murdered	by	the	saboteur	was	buried	three	days	ago	next	to	Rudy	in	our new	 cemetery.	 Her	 parents	 are	 taking	 it	 pretty	 hard	 and	 are	 demanding	 justice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	want	to	see	someone	hanged	or	electrocuted	or	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	seems	a	lot	of	people	want	to	know	if	our	prisoner	is	responsible	for	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">waking	 up	 ten	 years	 late.	 Oh,...and	 we	 have	 a	 visitor	 from	 the	 natives.	 She showed	 up	 not	 long	 after	 you	 left.	 Seems	 to	 be	 a	 nice	 kid,	 maybe	 fifteen,	 her name	 is	 Kira	 and	 she’s	 staying	 with	 Cindy	 and	 Rahul.	 She’s	 been	 walking around	 with	 them	 and	 soaking	 up	 everything.	 I	 hope	 what	 she	 is	 learning	 does not	come	back	to	haunt	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Chief	of	Security	was	well	aware	that	having	her	in	the	camp	was	a	risk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 thought	 it	 a	 risk	 worth	 taking.	 Developing	 trust	 with	 their	 neighbors	 was crucial.	Which	meant	addressing	the	issue	of	prejudice	needed	to	begin	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Try	 not	 to	 think	 of	 it	 that	 way.	 We	 are	 building	 a	 new	 society	 here,	 and we’re	going	to	need	the	natives	help.	They	know	more	about	this	planet	than	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	ever	know,	and	in	return,	we	can	help	them.	It’s	important	to	remember	this has	been	their	home	for	a	long	time,	and	we	need	mutual	trust	between	us	if	we</p>

<p class="calibre1">Al	 smiled	 and	 got	 off	 the	 soapbox,	 “How’s	 Robot	 Nine.	 Is	 he	 working	 out okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 comes	 in	 here	 every	 morning	 asking	 about	 you.	 I	 think	 he	 missed	 you Chief,”	one	man	said	as	he	walked	out	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	think	I	might	just	look	him	up	so	he	can	stop	worrying.	And	maybe</p>

<p class="calibre1">“We	have	it	under	control,”	they	told	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	started	raining	as	he	left,	but	he	didn’t	care.	He	was	happy	to	be	alive,	and he	had	his	hat	to	keep	his	head	dry.	Things	were	starting	to	look	up	again. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Kira	left	early	to	visit	the	gods	on	the	day	of	her	appointment.	She	dressed</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	her	finest	furs	and	carried	with	her	more	of	the	colorful	chains	woven</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 the	 hair	 of	 the	 Minitat	 to	 give	 as	 gifts.	 It	 was	 easy	 to	 see	 the	 gods	 were pleased	 when	 the	 tribe	 presented	 the	 first	 necklace.	 The	 braided	 strings	 around her	 neck	 accentuated	 her	 long	 auburn	 hair,	 dark	 brown	 eyes,	 and	 her	 colorful outfit;	she	was	a	beautiful	tribute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone	 was	 there	 to	 wish	 her	 good	 fortune.	 She	 hurried	 to	 say	 her goodbyes	and	started	down	the	path	to	the	Kuthra’s	kingdom.	She	did	not	hurry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	the	gods	were	to	sacrifice	her,	she	wanted	to	treasure	every	moment	of	her	life until	then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl,	not	quite	considered	an	adult,	was	still	dazed	from	being	picked	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 the	 one	 to	 visit	 the	 Kuthra.	 The	 elders	 wanted	 a	 young	 person	 with	 a	 sharp mind,	 who	 questioned	 everything.	 Everyone	 knew	 she	 was	 always	 asking</p>
<p class="calibre1">questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Along	the	way	she	bent	a	tiny	branch	every	so	often,	to	allow	her	people	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">track	her	if	they	needed	to;	more	out	of	habit	than	conscious	thought.	She	arrived at	 the	 gate	 to	 the	 Kuthra	 kingdom	 as	 the	 sun	 became	 whole	 on	 the	 horizon, adding	a	bright	and	colorful	tint	to	everything	she	saw.	Waiting	for	her	were	the two	Kuthra	she	met	at	the	caves,	and	they	appeared	excited	to	see	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rahul	and	Cindy	turned	off	the	section	of	fence	the	colony	used	as	a	gate	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">rushed	up	to	her.	Kira	mistook	their	intention,	took	a	step	backward,	and	dropped to	the	ground	in	an	attempt	not	to	offend	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	did	not	take	long	for	the	specialist’s	to	reign	in	their	enthusiasm,	convince the	frightened	Avalonian	to	stand,	and	introduce	themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	of	the	gods	said,	“Rahul,”	while	pointed	to	himself.	He	did	this	several</p>
<p class="calibre1">times,	and	then	he	indicated	the	God	that	accompanied	him	and	said,	“Cindy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	smart	girl,	Kira	quickly	realized	what	he	was	trying	to	say.  <i class="calibre4">He	is	telling	me</i> <i class="calibre4">what	to	call	them! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	young	native	with	the	long	dark	hair	indicated	herself	and	said,	“Kira,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 the	 gods	 were	 pleased.	 The	 next	 few	 hours	 were	 like	 an	 incredible	 dream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	absorbed	the	sights	and	sounds,	and	they	filled	her	with	wonder. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The	gods	have	homes	outside	the	mountain;	sitting	open	in	a	field.	They	must</i> <i class="calibre4">be	 very	 powerful	 not	 to	 be	 afraid.	 Boxes	 that	 move	 by	 themselves	 walk	 around</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a> <i class="calibre4">and	do	their	work	for	them. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">What	she	saw	was	confusing	and	awe-inspiring—and	a	little	frightening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	how	her	stay	with	the	gods	began,	and	she	learned	at	an	astounding</p>
<p class="calibre1">rate.	Kira	was	inquisitive	and	never	hesitated	to	ask	questions.	She	was	also	very determined	to	learn	to	speak	with	the	gods.	She	wanted	to	know	if	they	were	the kind	and	powerful	gods	of	their	teachings,	or	something	else.	Her	people	needed them	to	be	kind	and	powerful. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The	gods	do	not	need	flames	for	cooking.	They	sit	around	open	fires	and	do</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">little	more	than	admire	the	fires	they	build.	Inside	their	houses,	they	would	take</i> <i class="calibre4">something	from	a	silver	container,	remove	a	thin	colorful	wrapper,	put	it	back	in</i> <i class="calibre4">a	 different	 box,	 and	 out	 would	 come	 a	 delicious	 meal.

<p class="calibre1">One	 God	 spoke	 into	 a	 little	 box	 he	 held	 in	 his	 hand,  <i class="calibre4">and	 tiny	 beings	 inside</i> <i class="calibre4">the	box	answered	back—with	strong	voices! </i></p>

IT	WAS	RAINING	WHEN	Al	returned	to	see	the	prisoner	aboard	the	Excalibur. <p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">For	that	reason,	he	wore	his	hat.	The	bandages	were	gone,	but	the	rain	wasn’t.	It had	been	raining	since	he	walked	out	of	the	security	shack	a	week	ago,	and	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	stopped.	They	were	experiencing	the	spring	rainy	season	that	Kira	informed</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	happened	every	year.	It	was	a	warm	light	shower	that	resolutely	refused	to stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	 weeks	 after	 the	 surgery,	 he	 still	 could	 not	 remember	 anything	 more about	his	past	than	he	did	before.	It	was	a	possibility	the	doctors	had	mentioned and	 he	 was	 resolved	 to	 make	 the	 best	 of	 what	 he	 did	 know.	 He	 had	 hoped	 the tiny	meteoroid	was	the	cause	of	his	amnesia	and	his	headaches.	He	still	couldn’t remember.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 he	 no	 longer	 had	 the	 pain	 in	 his	 head	 or	 the confused	thinking.	He	decided	he	could	live	with	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 Al	 boarded	 the	 shuttle,	 he	 was	 thinking;  <i class="calibre4">Maybe	 the	 meteoroid	 was</i> <i class="calibre4">responsible	 for	 my	 waking	 up,	 which	 allowed	 me	 to	 wake	 all	 the	 rest.	 It	 is</i> <i class="calibre4">possible	 that	 minuscule	 chunk	 of	 metal	 allowed	 him	 to	 save	 the	 ship,	 and,</i> <i class="calibre4">therefore	everyone	on	it.	There	was	a	silver	lining	inside	the	meteor	cloud. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Tammy	 Shoemaker	 stayed	 locked	 in	 her	 cell	 for	 more	 than	 a	 month.	 Al meant	to	visit	her	sooner	until	life	kept	interfering.	No	one	came	to	visit	her	but the	officers	stuck	guarding	her,	and	 <i class="calibre4">they</i>	were	not	happy	about	it.	It	was	reported</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>she	mostly	read	and	meditated,	and	honestly	believed	she	was	not	long	for	this world,	or	any	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Accompanied	by	two	of	his	officers	from	the	planet,	they	came	to	escort	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	to	Avalon.	The	 <i class="calibre4">Excalibur	</i> was	being	prepared	for	extended	orbit,	and	most of	the	people	were	already	down	on	the	planet.	Soon,	the	ship	would	have	only	a skeleton	crew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	to	have	a	trial,	by	a	jury	of	her	peers.	Even	on	a	colony	ship,	there	is a	need	for	lawyers,	and	one	of	them	was	assigned	to	represent	her.	The	security team	was	there	to	move	her	to	the	temporary	jail	at	Camelot—to	prepare	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">trial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	moved	a	chair	over	to	the	cell	and	asked,	“How	are	you,	Tammy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	reply	was	blunt.	“I’m	all	right...for	a	dead	person.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	why	do	you	say	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	what	happens	to	people	that	don’t	conform	to	your	principles.”	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	this	statement	with	conviction;	sure	of	her	fate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	hasn’t	been	decided	what	will	happen	to	you.	You	will	have	to	go	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	trial.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	is	not	a	person	on	this	ship	that	will	allow	me	to	live.	It	is	not	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	needed	her	to	answer	a	disturbing	question.	“Did	you	have	anything	to	do</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	tampering	of	the	sleep	circuits,	that	caused	us	to	orbit	this	planet	for	ten years?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tammy	 looked	 surprised,	 and	 then	 bowed	 her	 head,	 “Does	 it	 matter?	 I	 will take	the	blame	for	all	the	wrong	on	this	expedition.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	does	matter.	You	are	still	young,	and	you’ve	been	conditioned	to	think	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	you	do.	Your	actions	may	not	be	entirely	your	fault,”	explained	Al. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	do	not	think	your	trial	will	find	me	innocent.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	Al	said	honestly,	“It	looks	like	you	might	have	caused	the	death	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">twelve-year-old	 child,	 and	 endangered	 many	 more	 people.	 There	 will	 be	 those that	want	someone	punished.	If	you	didn’t	tamper	with	the	sleep	circuits,	I	don’t believe	death	will	be	the	price.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tammy	 seemed	 confused,	 “I	 have	 been	 told	 you	 killed	 those	 you	 labeled terrorists	with	great	fanfare,	showing	your	justice	to	the	world	as	warnings	to	the other	 <i class="calibre4">Earth	First</i>	members.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can’t	always	believe	everything	you	hear.	You	have	to	use	your	head.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	thought	for	a	second	and	asked,	“Have	you	been	visited	by	someone	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	wanted	to	talk?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Miss	Emily	has	been	by	several	times,	and	she	likes	to	talk.	She	is	always</p>
<p class="calibre1">asking	 questions	 about	 things	 I	 don’t	 want	 to	 discuss.	 She	 seems	 nice.	 Is	 she	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>psychiatrist?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	 is	 your	 friend	 Tammy.	 Remember	 that	 because	 she	 can	 help	 you.	 Are you	ready	to	go?	We’re	kind	of	on	a	schedule.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	officers	unlocked	the	jail	door,	fastened	the	restraints,	and	escorted	her	to the	shuttle.	Al	followed	thoughtfully	behind	them. </p><p class="calibre1">

AL	 CLARK	 HAD	 A	 HOMECOMING	 party	 to	 attend.	 It	 was	 also	 a	 party	 to<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">celebrate	 Chris’s	 eighteenth	 birthday,	 and	 the	 first	 time	 he	 and	 his	 friends	 had been	able	to	get	together	since	coming	to	Camelot.	Most	of	them	lived	in	single unit	habitat	modules,	so	they	met	at	the	almost	finished	community	center. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Made	 from	 large	 native	 timbers	 and	 Dura-Steel,	 the	 octagonal	 construction was	a	building	large	enough	to	hold	nearly	all	the	colonists	at	the	same	time.	The center	was	 <i class="calibre4">so</i>	large	that	its	conical	roof,	when	completed,	would	furnish	enough rainwater	to	last	for	weeks.	It	was	a	lot	more	room	than	the	small	group	needed, but	it	was	available,	and	it	was	empty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 and	 Chris	 met	 on	 the	 path	 and	 walked	 there	 together.	 They	 joined	 Ana and	Kayla	outside	the	entrance,	and	as	a	group	walked	in	together.	They	found</p>
<p class="calibre1">Robot	Nine	waiting	patiently.	He	had	prepared	a	large	round	table	and	loaded	it with	food	and	drink.	Lit	with	led	work	lights,	it	was	a	surreal	setting	in	the	center of	 the	 dark	 auditorium.	 Al	 thought	 it	 fitting	 to	 have	 a	 large	 round	 table	 in Camelot’s	village	hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elizabeth’s	 footsteps	 echoed	 off	 the	 walls	 as	 she	 entered	 the	 room.	 “I	 hear there’s	a	party	here.	Somebody	pass	me	a	drink;	I	think	I	deserve	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rough	day	Mom?”	asked	Chris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	still	think	I	deserve	a	drink	even	if	it	wasn’t	that	bad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 son	 saw	 an	 opportunity	 and	 said,	 “You	  <i class="calibre4">do</i>	 realize	 that	 I	 too	 have	 been working	real	hard...and	it’s	my	birthday.	I	think	I	deserve	a	drink	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	I	don’t	know...you	think	he’s	old	enough	Al?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	a	drink	or	two	will	quench	his	curiosity,”	He	suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	grabbed	a	glass	and	exclaimed,	“All	right—let's	party!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Cody	arrived	the	group	was	complete,	and	they	ate,	drank,	talked,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	 relaxed.	 It	 was	 a	 pleasant	 gathering,	 long	 delayed,	 that	 reminded	 Al	 of	 the importance	 of	 friends.	 Sometime	 during	 the	 evening,	 Al	 decided	 he	 needed	 to tell	them	his	secret. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	been	considering	telling	them	for	some	time,	and	this	party	seemed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 perfect	 opportunity.	 There	 may	 not	 be	 another	 chance	 where	 they	 were	 all</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>gathered	together	in	a	private	setting	anytime	soon.	Every	one	of	them	had	asked questions	about	his	mysterious	surgery,	and—he	was	tired	of	lying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	found	out	something	you	should	know,”	Al	declared,	“I’m	a	human</p>
<p class="calibre1">being...in	a	robotic	body.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence	took	the	room,	and	his	friends	peered	at	him	as	if	he	had	gone	crazy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	faces	showed	them	wondering	what	kind	of	joke	this	was.	When	he	did	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">smile,	 they	 began	 to	 think	 he	 might	 not	 be	 kidding.	 Al	 told	 them	 everything, including	details	even	Cody	and	Robot	Nine	did	not	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	learned	I	was	the	victim	of	an	accident	that	left	me	without	the	use	of my	 arms	 and	 legs.	 They	 offered	 me	 a	 chance	 to	 participate	 in	 an	 experiment, where	they	would	place	my	brain	in	a	robotic	body	and	then	make	me	a	member</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	 <i class="calibre4">Excalibur</i>	expedition—and	apparently,	I	took	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 was	 brought	 aboard	 at	 the	 last	 minute,	 to	 be	 the	 secret	 backup	 alarm	 to awaken	 everyone	 upon	 arrival	 at	 Avalon—which	 obviously	 failed.	 Someone</p>
<p class="calibre1">tampered	 with	 both	 the	 computer	 revival	 systems	 and	 my	 specially	 designed hibernation	 pod,	 leaving	 us	 orbiting	 the	 planet	 until—believe	 it	 or	 not—a meteoroid	landed	in	my	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	friends	were	still	speechless,	and	could	only	stare	in	disbelief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	tiny	meteoroid	seems	to	have	taken	my	memories,	but	it	woke	me	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	saved	us	all	from	being	a	ship	of	ghosts.	The	emergency	operation	I	had	was to	remove	the	meteoroid	that	was	causing	me	some	additional	problems.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	piece	of	information	they	might	find	amusing	occurred	to	him,	“My</p>
<p class="calibre1">name	is	 <i class="calibre4">not</i>	Al	Clark.	The	roboticist’s	assistants	liked	to	call	me	‘Alarm	Clock’</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 an	 inside	 joke	 and	 placed	 the	 label	 on	 my	 door.	 When	 I	 woke	 up,	 the	 label was	so	old,	all	I	could	get	from	it	was	Al	Clark.	Funny...huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 he	 finished,	 his	 friends	 did	 not	 move	 or	 speak	 for	 several	 additional seconds.	Cody	lowered	his	head,	and	Robot	Nine	refilled	the	ice	buckets.	Cody</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 not	 sure	 if	 Al’s	 revealing	 himself	 was	 a	 good	 idea.	 Never	 the	 less,	 he decided	to	back	Al	no	matter	what	happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	that	how	you	were	able	to	get	from	one	side	of	the	camp	to	the	other	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter	of	minutes?”	Liz	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	the	fire	in	the	power	room?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	seem	to	need	a	lot	of	air.	To	tell	the	truth,	it	was	not	that	hard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	like...superhuman?”	Chris	wanted	to	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	certainly	don’t	think	so.	For	the	time	being	my	body	is	only	slightly	better than	ordinary	human	beings.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al’s	revelation	was	still	sinking	in	for	Ana	and	Kayla,	who	were	completely</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken	by	surprise.	Kayla	picked	up	on	how	he	began	his	last	question	and	wanted</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>it	explained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	do	you	say	for	the	time	being?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because	I	have	another	mode.	An	enhanced	mode.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	like	in	enhanced	mode?”	pressed	Ana. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.	I	haven’t	tried	it	yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	not?”	asked	Chris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	not	sure	I’m	ready	yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz	thought	about	all	they’d	been	through	together.	“How	come	you	haven’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">told	us	before	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	only	recently	found	out	myself,	and	I	wasn’t	sure	you	were	ready.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	explained	his	need	to	tell	Doctor	Cody	after	the	attack	returning	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">native’s	caves.	He	told	them	how	the	roboticist	Doctor	Florida	became	involved, and	how	Robot	Nine	knew	all	along. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	asked	the	robot,	“Why	didn’t	you	say	something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	 one	 ever	 asked,	 sir.	 If	 someone	 were	 to	 ask,	 I	 would	 be	 required	 to answer.	I	am	pleased	no	one	did	because	I	did	not	want	to	cause	Chief	Clark	any trouble.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	party	was	becoming	too	sober	for	an	eighteenth	birthday	celebration,	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	laughed	and	said,	“O...kay,	now	you	are	all	members	of	my	secret	society.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">need	all	of	you	to	help	me	figure	out	this	craziness.	How	about	we	call	it	the	Al Clark	secret	society	and	everyone	has	to	take	an	oath	of	silence.	All	in	favor,	say, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘aye.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	 by	 one	 they	 acknowledged	 their	 vows	 until	 it	 came	 to	 Robot	 Nine.	 “I will	not	reveal	your	secret	if	no	one	asks.	That	is	the	best	I	can	do,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 laughed	 and	 toasted	 the	 pact,	 then	 tried	 to	 act	 as	 if	 nothing	 had changed;	although	it	had.	None	of	them	would	ever	look	at	Al	in	the	same	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">again. </p><p class="calibre1">

THE	 TRIAL	 WAS	 SLATED	 to	 begin	 in	 two	 weeks,	 and	 psychiatrist	 Emily<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Saxton	 was	 still	 trying	 to	 understand	 her	 patient.	 The	 girl	 claimed	 to	 know nothing	 of	 the	 disabling	 of	 the	 hiber-pod	 revival	 circuits.

<p class="calibre1">“Your	foster	parents	were	part	of	the	 <i class="calibre4">Earth	First</i>	group?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a>“As	long	as	I	can	remember	they	were.	They	were	very	proud	of	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	old	are	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	be	eighteen	in	December.	Merry	Christmas	to	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	must	be	nice	to	be	born	around	Christmas.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 parents	 didn’t	 celebrate	 Christmas...or	 my	 birthday.	 They	 said</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christmas	 was	 a	 pagan	 holiday,	 and	 I	 did	 not	 deserve	 a	 party	 to	 celebrate	 my birth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emily	 frowned	 and	 answered,	 “That	 is	 entirely	 wrong.	 Everyone	 should	 be allowed	 to	 enjoy	 Christmas	 in	 their	 own	 way...you	 mean	 you’ve	 never	 had	 a birthday	party?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	them	for	myself.	I	give	myself	chocolate.	Happy	Birthday!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would	you	like	a	birthday	party?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 used	 to	 when	 I	 was	 little.	 It	 doesn’t	 matter	 anyway;	 I	 won’t	 live	 to	 see another	birthday. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you	won’t	with	that	attitude.	You	should	try	to	be	more	positive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t;	it’s	never	worked	for	me	before.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	we	can	win	this	trial,	your	life	could	be	much	better.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	would	like	to	believe	you.	The	more	I	think	about	it,	the	more	I	don’t	want</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	die.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emily’s	 evaluation	 stopped	 when	 Al	 walked	 into	 the	 room.	 He	 closed	 the door	 and	 joined	 them	 at	 the	 table.	 Addressing	 Emily,	 he	 said,	 “Can	 we	 talk outside	for	a	minute?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	followed	him	outside	where	he	asked,	“Well,	is	she	crazy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Depends	on	your	definition	of	crazy	Mister	Clark.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	she	sane	enough	to	stand	trial?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	so	if	we	can	get	her	adoptive	parents	out	of	her	head.	They	are	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Is	there	a	chance	she	can	change?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	in	time...if	we	can	keep	her	alive,”	stressed	the	psychiatrist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	frowned	and	confessed,	“I	have	to	admit,	Emily,	I	think	putting	people	to</p>

CHRIS’	MIND	WAS	NOT	on	the	trial.	He	was	working	to	complete	his	duties	at<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">the	 village	 power	 plant,	 hoping	 to	 make	 some	 excuse	 to	 get	 up	 to	 the	 ship	 and talk	 to	 the	 roboticist.	 Chris	 was	 intrigued,	 and	 contemplating	 the	 potential</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>capabilities	of	Al	Clark	made	him	even	more	curious.	A	human	mind	in	a	robot’s body? </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">How	fast	can	he	go...really? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">How	strong	are	his	legs?	Can	he	jump	like	the	Hulk,	the	angry	comic	book</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">hero? </i>	 The	 more	 he	 considered	 Al’s	 revelation,	 the	 more	 respect	 he	 had	 for	 his friend.	 Chris	 could	 not	 imagine	 the	 things	 that	 must	 have	 been	 going	 through Al’s	mind	since	waking	up	in	that	box. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Are	his	eyes	capable	of	infrared?	Can	he	zoom	in	on	distant	objects?	Can	he</i> <i class="calibre4">bend	steel	with	his	bare	hands? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 questions	 were	 driving	 him	 insane,	 and	 he	 didn’t	 want	 to	 bother	 the security	chief.	However,	 he	knew	Doctor	 Florida	had	the	 manual—the	book	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Al,	and	that	the	good	doctor	probably	knew	more	about	Al	than	Al	did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	mother	noticed	Chris	acting	oddly,	as	mothers	do,	and	suspected	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	to	something.	She	sat	him	down,	and	they	talked.	It	didn’t	take	long	before	he was	spilling	his	guts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	 you	 want	 to	 talk	 to	 the	 roboticist?	 Hey...I	 happen	 to	 need	 someone	 to bring	 down	 some	 supplies	 from	 the	 ship.	 Would	 you	 like	 to	 volunteer?”	 Liz suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	son	smiled	and	replied,	“I	would	be	happy	to	get	your	supplies	for	you, </p>
<p class="calibre1">mother.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 can	 on	 one	 condition.	 You	 have	 to	 tell	 me	 everything	 Doctor	 Florida says.	I	want	a	full	report.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mother	and	son,	in	league	together,	for	the	betterment	of	Al. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	 caught	 a	 ride	 with	 the	 morning	 shuttle	 and	 arrived	 outside	 the	 robot shop	 just	 before	 lunch	 time.	 He	 opened	 the	 door	 and	 walked	 in	 to	 find	 the scientist	 sitting	 at	 a	 table	 looking	 thoughtful.	 Music	 was	 playing	 in	 the background	 that	 he	 recognized	 as	 an	 old	 song,	 recorded	 before	 his	 time.	 The doctor	appeared	to	be	just	the	way	Al	described;	an	older	man,	short,	with	wild hair	and	a	relaxed	attitude. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	Doctor	Florida?”	Chris	guessed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,	son.	You	must	be	Al’s	friend	Chris,	am	I	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes	 sir,	 I’m	 Al’s	 friend.	 If	 you	 don’t	 mind,	 I	 have	 a	 couple	 questions	 for you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Edward	smiled	and	said,	“Only	a	couple?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	looked	a	little	guilty	and	continued,	“Al	told	us	his	incredible	secret.	A human	with	a	robotic	body	and	I	do	have	some	questions.	The	first	one	is,	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">music	are	you	listening	to?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Edward	Florida	reached	over	and	turned	the	music	down,	“Oh...that.	I	have	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fondness	 for	 Beatles	 music.	 They	 were	 a	 four	 man	 group	 from	 the	 nineteen</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>sixties.	I	like	other	groups	from	that	era,	but	they	are	my	favorite.	They	made	a song	for	every	mood.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 thought	 they	 sounded	 familiar.	 Anyway,	 what	 do	 you	 think	 of	 our	 friend Al?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doctor	 Florida	 had	 considered	 this	 question.	 It	 would,	 in	 the	 future,	 be	 a question	he	expected	to	be	asked	again	and	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Al	Clark	is	a	remarkable	person	with	unique	capabilities.	He	can	do	a	lot	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">help	protect	us	on	this	dangerous	planet...and	I	like	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um...what	is	he	exactly?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 question	 involved	 the	 scientist’s	 field,	 and	 it	 was	 one	 he’d	 been contemplating	since	before	he	started	his	career,	so	his	answer	was	simple. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our	friend	is	a	cybernetic	construct.	A	human	brain	with	complete	control</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 a	 very	 sophisticated	 transport	 machine.	 He	 has	 a	 titanium	 chassis,	 made mobile	 by	 class	 five	 motors	 and	 actuators.	 His	 skin	 is	 a	 remarkable	 Tru-Skin covering	 that	 can	 heal	 itself,	 and	 his	 power	 pack	 will	 last	 for	 twenty	 years.	 I didn’t	even	know	this	was	possible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	was	he	really...before	the	accident?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know.	There	is	no	mention	of	his	name	in	the	book,	only	references</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 a	 subject	 fourteen.	 According	 to	 the	 book,	 the	 volunteer	 was	 educated, intelligent,	and	active	before	the	accident.	The	book	does	not	give	a	name	to	that person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	asked	another	question.	“He	told	us	he	has	a	second	mode,	what’s	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">like?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everything	changes	when	he	is	in	enhanced	mode.	I	don’t	yet	understand	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 what	 the	 notebook	 implies.	 However,	 the	 changes	 are	 substantial.	 Doctor Hawthorn,	the	man	that	designed	his	body,	was	a	genius.	He	was	way	ahead	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 time	 and	 the	 leading	 expert	 on	 integration	 between	 the	 human	 brain	 and highly	adaptive	robotics.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	know	what	Al	is	capable	of?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 the	 thing.	 The	 book	 only	 makes	 estimates.	 There	 wasn’t	 time	 for many	tests	before	they	put	him	into	hibernation	for	the	trip.	Nobody	knows	what he	is	ultimately	capable	of.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	idea	had	been	germinating	in	Chris’s	head	that	might	give	them	a	chance</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	help	Al	find	out	what	his	enhanced	mode	offered.	“Don’t	you	think	we	should</p>
<p class="calibre1">run	some	tests?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	is	an	excellent	idea	Chris,	but	how?	I	don’t	have	the	equipment	to	test</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	properly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	does	it	take	to	change	his	mode?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>“He	must	be	on	board	to	change	it	permanently,	although	Doctor	Hawthorn did	 not	 recommend	 changing	 from	 normal	 to	 enhanced	 mode	 until	 the	 colony fully	 accepted	 Al.”	 Edward	 hesitated,	 and	 continued,	 “There	 is	 an	 override, though.	 It’s	 a	 temporary	 override,	 triggered	 by	 a	 phrase,	 which	 I	 believe	 lasts about	an	hour.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	we	do	the	basic	tests	here,	like	hand	and	leg	strength?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	tests	would	be	limited.	This	place	is	not	equipped	to	handle	something</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	Al.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	occurred	to	the	scientist	that	he	had	just	referred	to	Al	as	a	thing	and	that he	would	have	to	be	more	careful	in	the	future	how	he	referred	to	his	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	suggested,	maybe	 a	little	too	 eagerly,	“We	could	 run	some	monitored</p>
<p class="calibre1">tests	down	on	the	planet,	maybe	time	some	runs,	or	break	some	branches.	What</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	you	think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Once	 again,	 we	 have	 to	 remember	 the	 consequences	 of	 his	 powers	 being discovered.	We	will	have	to	do	all	our	testing	in	complete	secrecy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	about	we	take	a	shuttle	to	another	part	of	the	planet?	I	know	just	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	pilot	it.	It	would	be	you,	me,	Al,	and	the	captain.	I’ll	be	the	coach.	What	do you	think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait	 a	 minute	 son;	 we’ll	 have	 to	 talk	 this	 over	 with	 Captain	 Effinger	 and Mister	Clark.	I’ll	tell	you	what,	you	talk	to	Al,	and	I’ll	talk	to	the	captain.	Then we’ll	all	get	together	and	discuss	the	possibilities.	How	about	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Edwards	suggestion	was	close	to	what	Chris	was	hoping.  <i class="calibre4">A	field	trip	to	put	a</i> <i class="calibre4">Superman	through	his	paces. </i> His	friend	being	the	Superman. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">Chapter	Seventeen</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">They	landed	just	after	dawn;	after	sneaking	away	from	Camelot	in	the	dark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 captain	 picked	 them	 up	 on	 the	 outskirts	 of	 the	 settlement	 shortly before	 dawn	 and	 spirited	 them	 away	 to	 test	 Al’s	 potential	 in	 private.	 He	 flew them	to	an	isolated	spot	with	giant	trees,	rolling	hills,	rushing	water,	and	plenty of	open	ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	discussed,	the	party	consisted	of	Chris,	Al,	the	roboticist	Edward	Florida, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 the	 captain.	 When	 Al	 informed	 the	 rest	 of	 his	 conspirators,	 they	 had	 all wanted	 to	 come.	 With	 regret,	 to	 minimize	 suspicion,	 he	 had	 to	 tell	 them,	 “Not this	 time.	 We	 have	 to	 be	 discrete.”	 They	 were	 disappointed	 but	 understood	 the risk.	The	group	was	small	for	a	good	reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	was	ready	to	get	started.	“Okay—how	do	you	want	to	do	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Edward	 explained,	 “Slowly	 and	 carefully	 Al.	 Chris	 has	 devised	 a	 series	 of tests	with	my	recommendations,	starting	with	your	legs	and	working	from	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	 will	 be	 informal	 tests	 that	 will	 give	 us	 a	 general	 idea	 as	 to	 your capabilities.	We	can	refine	them	as	we	go.	For	this	series	of	trials,	I	will	be	the record	keeper.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tobias	Effinger,	as	captain,	felt	he	needed	to	say	something	to	the	group.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">retrieved	some	folding	chairs	from	the	shuttle	and	urged	everyone	to	sit	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Slow	and	careful	are	the	key	words	here.	I	don’t	want	anyone	getting	hurt</p>
<p class="calibre1">because	we	rushed	things.	Remember	this	is	a	potentially	dangerous	experiment, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 I	 want	 all	 of	 you	 to	 remain	 cautious,	 especially	 you	 Al.	 Please—take	 your time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	do	my	best,	Tobias.	After	all,	I’m	the	one	most	likely	to	get	hurt.	You</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	count	on	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	robot	specialist	moved	his	chair	directly	in	front	of	Al	and	looked	him	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 eyes	 as	 he	 spoke,	 “There	 is	 a	 phrase	 I	 will	 say	 to	 you.	 You	 will	 repeat	 the phrase	exactly	as	I	say	it,	and	you	will	begin	to	feel	a	transition.	Give	yourself	a few	minutes	to	get	used	to	the	change	before	you	try	and	stand	up.	I	believe	your enhanced	mode	will	take	some	getting	used	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Edward	 looked	 around	 and	 silently	 asked	 permission	 to	 proceed.	 When	 the others	nodded	their	approval,	he	asked	his	friend,	“Are	you	ready?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	said,	“Doc,	I’ve	been	waiting	for	this	since	I	found	out	what	I	am.	Yes...I</p>
<p class="calibre1">am	ready.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>“I	want	you	to	understand	something.	The	time	you	spend	in	enhanced	mode will	 subtract	 significantly	 from	 the	 lifespan	 of	 your	 body’s	 power-pack.	 The twenty-year	span	is	based	on	being	in	 <i class="calibre4">human</i>	mode	only.	When	it	gets	depleted to	a	certain	point,	it	will	have	to	be	replaced.	Hopefully,	by	then	I	will	be	able	to build	a	new	one.	Is	that	acceptable?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on	Doc,	let’s	get	on	with	it.	Oh,	wait,	what	if	I	can’t	handle	it?	What</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	it’s	too	much	for	my	puny	human	brain?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	are	controlling	a	very	sophisticated	computer	that	in	turn	controls	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">body.	 It	 can	 recognize	 high	 levels	 of	 stress	 and	 immediately	 take	 you	 back	 to human	 mode.	 It	 is	 one	 of	 the	 many	 fail-safes	 built	 into	 the	 system...um,	 your body.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	was	resolute.	He	had	to	know.	“All	right,	let’s	do	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Edward	smiled	and	said,	“All	right,	sit	perfectly	still.	Here	is	the	phrase:	The metal	of	a	man	is	measured	by	what	is	inside.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	metal	of	a	man	is	measured	by	what	is	inside,”	Al	repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	human	being	had	experienced	what	Al	now	went	through.	The	feeling	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">power	 steadily	 ramped	 up	 until	 it	 was	 ringing	 in	 his	 ears.	 Something	 changed, and	 the	 ringing	 went	 away.	 Everything	 he	 saw	 became	 crystal	 clear	 for	 a moment	and	then	exploded	into	a	blinding	light.	Then	the	light	went	out,	and	so did	he.	Chris	had	to	reach	over	and	grab	him	to	prevent	Al	from	falling	out	of	the chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thirty	minutes	later	Al	woke	up	and	asked,	“What	just	happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	was	the	first	to	answer,	“Tobias	says	the	transition	was	more	than	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	process,	and	you	passed	out.	How	do	you	feel?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 looked	 around,	 “Well,	 I	 think	 I’m	 okay...my	 head	 is	 a	 little	 fuzzy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Otherwise,	I	think	I’m	good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	believe	you	were	ready,”	Edward	said,	“You	were	too	nervous,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	need	to	be	relaxed.	Maybe	even	close	your	eyes	until	everything	else	boots</p>
<p class="calibre1">up.	Do	you	want	to	try	again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes...how	about	we	give	it	a	minute—okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	 hour	 after	 Al	 passed	 out	 he	 tried	 again.	 This	 time,	 he	 cleared	 his	 mind and	sat	perfectly	still	with	his	eyes	closed,	and	the	transition	was	less	traumatic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 power	 ramped	 up	 much	 as	 before,	 and	 when	 the	 ringing	 went	 away	 this time,	 Al	 could	 hear	 as	 he	 had	 never	 heard	 before.	 He	 quickly	 discovered	 he could	 tone	 it	 down	 and	 make	 the	 overwhelming	 input	 of	 sound	 more	 bearable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	moment	he	just	sat	there;	adjusting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	started	the	timer	about	the	time	Al	opened	his	eyes.	For	a	half	second, </p>
<p class="calibre1">his	eyes	struggled	to	focus,	and	then	everything	became	clear.	There	were	small, discreet	 indicators	 on	 both	 sides	 of	 his	 vision	 providing	 essential	 readings	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>power,	 temperature,	 and	 distance.	 In-between	 the	 information	 tell-tales	 was	 the sharpest,	brightest,	and	most	detailed	world	Al	had	ever	seen.	He	found	that	if	he focused	on	a	particular	spot	and	concentrated,	he	could	zoom	in	and	out	at	will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	hear	you	now,”	the	captain	pointed	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sounds	the	mechanisms	inside	him	made	were	indeed	slightly	louder.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">slowly	 stood	 up,	 hearing	 each	 motor	 and	 feeling	 each	 actuator	 react	 to	 his commands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Man...this	 is	 unbelievable.	 I	 can	 see	 better,	 hear	 better,	 and	 it	 feels	 great! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let’s	do	some	testing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	took	three	steps	forward	and	fell	on	his	butt	as	his	legs	ran	out	from	under him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	 helped	 him	 up.	 “Maybe	 you	 have	 to	 lean	 into	 it	 or	 something...you think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ha!	Now	why	didn’t	I	think	of	that?”	Al	brushed	himself	off	and	laughed	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	same	time.	He	had	a	good	feeling	about	this.	“What’s	the	first	test?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	a	large	flat	area	nearby,	Chris	marked	off	forty-six	meters	(fifty	yards)	for a	track	and	placed	a	marker	at	both	ends.	The	captain	stationed	himself	at	the	far end,	and	Chris	stood	by	the	starting	point	with	Al.	Edward	prepared	his	data	pad to	record	the	occasion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 staggered	 to	 the	 far	 marker	 the	 first	 time	 and	 then	 walked	 on	 the	 way back.	Each	consecutive	trip	became	a	little	faster	until	he	thought	he	was	ready for	the	clock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	felt	so	good	he	decided	to	test	his	new	ability	unrestrained,	and	picked	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">tree	 in	 the	 distance,	 waved	 at	 his	 friends,	 and	 took	 off	 running	 towards	 it.	 His enhanced	eyesight	allowed	him	to	see	every	rock	or	branch	in	his	path,	and	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	there	and	back	before	anyone	had	time	to	complain.	He	was	 <i class="calibre4">extremely	</i> fast and	already	enjoying	his	newfound	freedom	immensely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 fifty-yard	 dash	 he	 did	 in	 a	 little	 over	 four	 seconds.	 Almost	 a	 second faster	than	the	fastest	human	ever	recorded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	we	have	to	see	if	you	can	jump,”	suggested	Chris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 it	 turned	 out,	 Al	 was	 also	 good	 at	 propelling	 himself	 upward.	 When	 he tried	hard,	he	could	clear	thirty	feet	straight	up.	It	wasn’t	long	before	he	figured out	 he	 needed	 to	 bend	 his	 legs	 when	 landing.	 He	 left	 dents	 in	 the	 soft	 soil	 and almost	fell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 amazed	 how	 much	 was	 visible	 from	 thirty	 feet	 up,	 and	 he	 jumped three	and	then	four	times,	each	time	looking	a	different	direction.	On	his	fourth leap,	 he	 spotted	 something	 move	 behind	 the	 shuttle.	 A	 flash	 of	 gold	 caught	 his attention	 where	 gold	 should	 not	 be.	 Something	 was	 watching	 them	 from	 the other	side	of	the	aircraft. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a>Al	 motioned	 to	 get	 down	 and	 pointed	 to	 the	 rear	 of	 the	 shuttle.	 Chris	 and Edward	ran	for	cover	while	the	captain	took	two	steps	to	his	left	and	picked	up the	rifle	from	where	he	left	it;	pointing	it	in	the	direction	Al	indicated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cat-like	animal	sensed	something	wrong,	and	came	around	the	shuttle	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	full	charge,	pouncing	for	the	closest	victim—the	short,	wild-haired	roboticist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately	for	the	beast,	it	was	not	fast	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	didn’t	take	the	time	to	think,	he	reacted	by	knocking	the	creature	out	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">mid-air,	 and	 threw	 it	 twenty	 feet	 into	 the	 open.	 It	 took	 the	 captain	 a	 second	 to realize	what	had	happened,	but	he	quickly	gathered	himself,	aimed,	and	shot	the thing	several	times	with	the	laser. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 should	 have	 checked	 this	 place	 better	 when	 we	 got	 here.	 Let’s	 have	 a look	 around	 now,”	 suggested	 Al.	 “To	 make	 sure	 we	 don’t	 have	 more	 visitors.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	reminded	himself	once	again.  <i class="calibre4">Never	let	your	guard	down. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 a	 thorough	 search	 of	 the	 surrounding	 area,	 Captain	 Effinger	 stood staring	at	the	large	white	cat	and	its	golden	stripes,	with	the	rifle	nestled	in	one arm.	“It	looks	like	a	saber-tooth	tiger,	except	with	white	and	gold	fur.	Look	at	the teeth	on	that	thing.	I’ll	bet	it	weighs	at	least	a	hundred	pounds!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	 said,	 “I	 wouldn’t	 want	 to	 run	 into	 that	 thing	 anywhere	 without	 a rifle...by	 the	 way,	 nice	 shot,	 and	 thank	 you.	 It	 was	 headed	 for	 me	 next, umm...after	he	finished	with	Doctor	Florida.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 captain	 looked	 at	 Chris.	 He	 then	 shook	 his	 head	 and	 replied,	 “Don’t thank	me,	thank	Al.	If	he	hadn’t	been	here,	Edward	would	probably	be	dead.	If	I couldn’t	get	a	shot	off	fast	enough,	maybe	you	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am	really	happy,	Al,	that	you	are	my	friend	and	not	my	enemy,”	exclaimed</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris.	Al	just	grinned	while	the	rest	silently	agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 precisely	 one	 hour	 into	 his	 first	 foray	 in	 enhanced	 mode,	 a	 timer somewhere	 wound	 down,	 and	 he	 became	  <i class="calibre4">normal</i>	 again.	 Well,	 as	 normal	 as	 he could	be.	Al	could	feel	the	power	slipping	away,	and	he	noted	again	how	good	it felt.	He	wanted	it	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 the	 way	 back	 to	 the	 settlement,	 Edward	 chuckled	 and	 said,	 “Dr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawthorn	even	spelled	it	m-e-t-a-l,	instead	of	m-e-t-t-l-e,	in	the	phrase	we	used to	 take	 you	 to	 enhanced	 mode.	 He	 was	 a	 genius	 with	 a	 sense	 of	 humor. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“What	was	it	like,	Al...in	enhanced	mode?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	hard	to	 describe,”	Al	answered.	 “You	know	how	 sometimes	you	 wake</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	refreshed	and	rested,	with	every	fiber	of	your	being	telling	you	to	get	up	and do	something?	It’s	kind	of	like	that—only	times	ten.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 beginning	 to	 get	 dark,	 and	 they	 had	 gathered	 at	 Elizabeth’s	 place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 Chris	 moved	 out	 to	 a	 place	 of	 his	 own,	 she	 was	 allowed	 to	 keep	 the double	sized	quarters	they	had.	Rank	does	have	its	privileges. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	you	like	having	a	place	of	your	own	Chris?”	asked	Al. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 it’s	 great.	 Nobody	 is	 bugging	 me	 to	 do	 this	 or	 do	 that...no	 offense Mom.”	Chris	couldn’t	help	but	laugh,	and	they	all	joined	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seriously	though,	it	is	nice	to	have	my	own	stuff	in	my	own	place,	and...it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	 much	 quieter.”	 Chris	 was	 enjoying	 his	 new	 freedom,	 and	 could	 not	 resist kidding	his	mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	first	friends	in	the	new	world	watched	a	beautiful	sunset,	and	afterward, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they	retired	inside	to	eat—and	to	talk.	It	was	early	evening,	and	the	original	six: Chris,	Liz,	Ana,	Kayla,	Cody,	and	Al,	gathered	for	support. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 conversation	 turned	 to	 Tammy	 Shoemaker’s	 trial.	 Al	 asked,	 “What	 do you	 think	 will	 happen	 at	 the	 trial	 this	 weekend?”	 He	 had	 visited	 the	 prisoner several	 times	 and	 found	 himself	 feeling	 sorry	 for	 her.	 She	 seemed	 more	 and more	to	be	a	victim	of	circumstance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz	had	doubts	about	whether	or	not	Tammy	Shoemaker	would	be	allowed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">live. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	 are	 people	 here	 that	 want	 her	 head	 put	 on	 a	 stake	 and	 placed	 at	 the gate.	 I	 heard	 some	 say	 we	 should	 stone	 her.	 It	 will	 be	 a	 tough	 fight	 for	 the defense.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 pointed	 out,	 “I	 hope	 the	 jury	 realizes	 that	 we	 are	 already	 down	 to	 eight hundred	and	thirty	people.	For	a	healthy	community,	I	think	the	more	people—</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	better.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	appeared	uncomfortable	and	did	not	join	the	speculation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	 change	 the	 subject,	 Doc	 Cody	 asked	 Al,	 “Have	 there	 been	 any	 more sightings	of	the	dinosaurs...the	Riktors?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually	 no.	 Nobody’s	 seen	 anything	 but	 a	 few	 tracks	 around	 here	 in	 a while.	 Although,	 we	 did	 find	 a	 pair	 of	 smaller	 ones	 pulling	 rocks	 from	 the entrance	to	the	Sansi	caves	during	one	of	the	Watcher’s	rounds.	The	man	on	duty made	the	watcher	drone	visible	and	tapped	them	on	the	head	a	couple	of	times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	ran	away,	and	the	natives	could	be	heard	cheering	from	inside	their	caves.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>“Do	you	think	the	beasts	have	learned	their	lesson	about	attacking	us?”	asked Chris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 thought	 for	 a	 second,	 “I	 would	 like	 to	 think	 so,	 but	 I	 don’t	 believe	 it.	 It would	be	wise	to	keep	our	guard	up.	I	have	four	armed	men	continually	circling</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	compound,	the	two	watchers	a	little	further	out,	and	Robot	Nine	roaming	all over.	I	think	we’re	as	safe	as	we	can	be.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Around	the	village,	Al	had	seen	the	visitor	from	the	caves	following	behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rahul	and	Cindy,	“How	is	the	native	doing?	The	Sansi	girl?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	 is	 a	 bundle	 of	 sunshine,”	 replied	 Ana.	 “Everywhere	 Kira	 goes	 she leaves	 people	 smiling,	 and	 people	 love	 talking	 to	 her.	 She’s	 due	 to	 head	 home soon	and	tell	her	tribe	of	her	time	with	us.	How	I’d	love	to	be	a	fly	on	the	cave wall	when	she	does.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	 asked	 me	 how	 the	 little	 people	 can	 live	 in	 the	 radios.	 She	 is	 a	 riot,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 one	 of	 the	 better	 evenings.	 An	 evening	 that	 one	 remembered	 as <i class="calibre4">pleasant</i>	later	in	life.	They	talked,	and	made	wisecracks,	and	laughed.	They	all tried	hard	to	hide	their	fears	and	be	hopeful	for	the	future</p><p class="calibre1">

KIRA	WAS	READY	TO	LEAVE.	She	missed	her	home,	and	then	again	she	did<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">not.	She	was	torn	between	leaving	these	wonderful	people	and	going	back	to	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">loved	 ones;	 all	 the	 time	 thinking	 she	 might	 not	 be	 allowed	 to	 return	 to	 this magical	 village.	 She	 believed	 the	 gods	 were	 happy	 with	 her,	 and	 allow	 her	 to return.	The	problem	was	that	someone	else	from	her	tribe	deserved	a	turn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 wonder	 of	 the	 things	 she	 saw	 while	 living	 with	 them	 made	 her	 feel grateful.	The	ones	called	Cindy	and	Rahul	were	kind	and	helpful.	They	showed</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	everything	she	asked	about,	and	some	she	did	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">There	 are	 rain	 rooms	 inside	 their	 homes	 where	 they	 can	 clean	 themselves</i>, she	 was	 thinking,  <i class="calibre4">and	 soft	 rocks	 that	 bubble	 in	 the	 waterfalls	 to	 make	 dirt</i> <i class="calibre4">disappear. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	allowed	up	to	their	starship	and	given	a	slow,	well-explained	tour	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Excalibur	only	two	days	ago,	and	the	images	were	fresh	in	her	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	beautiful	blue	home	slowly	circled	below	her,	while	she	held	tight	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rail;	afraid	of	falling.	The	captain	explained	why	the	Sansi	could	see	the	ship	as it	 passed	 overhead	 at	 night.	 When	 Cindy	 tried	 to	 explain	 the	 hiber-pods,	 she could	not	imagine	sleeping	for	so	many	years.	She,	like	many	others,	loved	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">habitat	 hub	 where	 you	 could	 fly.	 There	 were	 many	 wonders,	 and	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>explanations	were	only	partly	successful.	Even	without	fully	understanding,	she loved	it	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 showed	 her	 the	 medical	 center,	 where	 it	 was	 possible	 for	 the	 gods	 to heal	themselves.	When	she	learned	a	god	could	die,	it	confused	her	for	awhile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 idea	 took	 some	 time	 to	 sink	 in.	 She	 was,	 however,	 a	 smart	 girl,	 and eventually	accepted	the	possibility. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cindy,	Rahul,	and	a	god	that	carried	a	stick	that	shoots	fire	accompanied	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 caves.	 As	 soon	 as	 they	 were	 close	 enough	 to	 see	 her	 home,	 they	 were greeted	by	what	must	have	been	most	of	the	Sansi	tribe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	natives	were	excited	and	glad	to	see	them;	talking	all	at	once.	Members</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 tribe	 brought	 baskets	 of	 fruit	 out	 and	 laid	 them	 before	 their	 guests	 as	 a tribute	to	their	saviors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	contact	specialists	and	the	girl	had	come	a	long	way	in	their	ability</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	communicate.	Regardless	of	their	progress,	the	humans	still	could	not	keep	up with	the	rapid-fire	conversation	going	on	between	Kira	and	her	tribe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cindy	turned	to	the	girl	and	asked,	“What	are	they	talking	about	Kira?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	say	to	me...that	you	have	saved	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Puzzled,	Rahul	asked,	“What	did	we	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	made	the	Riktors	run	away	with	your	magic	floating	rocks	that	cannot</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	seen.	My	people	are	very...happy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 contact	 specialists	 enjoyed	 the	 party	 regardless	 of	 the	 fact	 they	 had	 no idea	what	the	natives	were	talking	about.	After	a	while,	they	figured	out	enough to	 know	 that	 somebody	 had	 neglected	 to	 keep	 them	 informed	 about	 matters concerning	 the	 natives.	 Someone	 should	 have	 told	 them	 the	 Sansi	 had	 been attacked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kira	was	glad	to	be	home.	She	missed	her	family	and	friends	and	the	simple, </p>
<p class="calibre1">familiar	life	that	led.	Most	of	all	she	missed	Toji,	her	special	friend	that	would someday	become	her	mate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	things	that	she	had	learned	while	with	the	Kuthra	told	her	that	the	gods</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	in	many	ways	very	much	like	the	Sansi.	The	gods	that	came	to	save	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 smart	 and	 powerful,	 but	 they	 were	 not	  <i class="calibre4">all</i>-powerful.	 The	 Kuthra,	 like	 her people,	 could	 be	 killed.	 As	 the	 party	 of	 three	 gods	 left	 the	 Sansi,	 her	 people raised	 their	 right	 hands	 above	 their	 heads	 as	 a	 sign	 of	 farewell.

SITTING	 IN	 HER	 PRISON,	 Tammy	 Shoemaker	 was	 scared	 and	 angry.	 Angry<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">that	she	was	afraid.	Her	parents	told	her	many	times	that	giving	yourself	to	your</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>cause	would	lead	to	a	place	in	heaven.	A	beautiful	place	where	you	would	live forever.	Lately,	though,	she	was	beginning	to	have	doubts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 prison	 was	 a	 standard	 habitat	 module,	 placed	 as	 far	 away	 as	 possible from	the	rest	of	the	settlement	with	bars	added	to	the	windows.	A	ten-foot	chain link	fence	with	barbed	wire	on	top	surrounded	the	habitat;	leaving	a	fifteen-foot walkway	all	around.	She	was	allowed	thirty	minutes	a	day	to	spend	in	the	 <i class="calibre4">Yard</i>, which	she	learned	to	treasure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	of	the	time	she	was	alone	inside	her	cell,	with	her	guard	stationed	in	the yard.	The	captain	stopped	by	once,	the	big	cheese	security	man	twice,	her	lawyer and	 psychiatrist	 switched	 hours	 every	 other	 day.	 Christopher	 Morris,	 to	 her delight,	was	seeing	her	more	and	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 surprised	 her	 two	 weeks	 ago	 when	 the	 guard	 knocked	 on	 her	 door</p>
<p class="calibre1">declaring	she	had	a	visitor.	Standing	outside	was	Chris,	with	a	lot	of	questions; most	 of	 which	 she	 had	 answered	 numerous	 times.	 At	 first,	 he	 appeared	 self-righteous	 and	 patronizing.	 As	 time	 went	 by,	 Chris	 kept	 coming	 back,	 and	 she began	 to	 think	 that	 he	 might	 care	 what	 happens	 to	 her.	 He	 was	 always	 so thoughtful,	and	supportive,	that	Tammy	thought	of	him	as	her	ray	of	hope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 life	 on	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Excalibur	 </i> had	 been	 a	 solitary	 one.	 She	 purposely	 made	 no friends,	 afraid	 they	 would	 ask	 too	 many	 questions,	 so	 there	 was	 no	 one	 to	 talk her	out	of	her	destructive	tendencies.	She	had	affected	her	sabotage	in	the	belief she	 was	 helping	 her	 cause.	 Looking	 back	 now,	 she	 realized	 she	 left	 her	 cause behind	 a	 long	 time	 ago.	 Never	 again	 would	 she	 hear	 the	 stern	 teachings	 of	 her stepparents,	 or	 set	 foot	 on	 the	 polluted,	 over-populated	 Earth.	 During	 her incarceration,	 she	 had	 time	 to	 think	 and	 began	 to	 realize	 her	 parents	 had	 been wrong	on	many	matters.	In	Tammy’s	eyes—she	had	played	the	part	of	a	puppet</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	a	fool. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	was	sitting	across	from	her	at	the	table	when	she	asked,	“Do	you	really</p>
<p class="calibre1">think	they’ll	let	me	live?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	can’t...execute	you.	You	have	too	much	to	offer	the	colony.	With	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">skills,	there	must	be	a	hundred	jobs	you	could	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	colonists	will	not	believe	I	am	sorry.	If	I	were	them,	I	wouldn’t	either.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	believe	you’re	sorry,	and	I’ll	tell	them	that.	I	know	a	lot	of	people	that	will testify	the	same	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 people	 you	 refer	 to	 are	 maybe	 a	 dozen	 out	 of	 eight	 hundred	 and something.	I	find	it	hard	to	be	optimistic	after	what	I’ve	done.	To	most	of	these people,	I	am	a	murderer	at	the	very	least.	Maybe	I	deserve	to	die.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	reached	over	and	took	her	hand,	“Listen	to	me—there	are	a	lot	of	good</p>
<p class="calibre1">people	here	that	just	want	to	live	their	lives.	They	work	hard	and	try	to	be	fair	to each	other.	I	think	you’ll	find	more	forgiveness	in	them	than	you	expect.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a>He	turned	her	hand	over	and	took	on	a	scholarly	attitude.	He	looked	down	at her	palm	and	said,	“You	have	a	long	life	line...that	ends	in	three	children...and	a lot	of	laundry	to	do.	I	see	dishes...and	robots—lots	of	robots.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 smile	 grew	 on	 the	 girls	 face,	 “You	 don’t	 know	 anything	 about	 palm reading.	How	could	you	possibly	make	those	predictions?	You	are	crazy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Crazy	huh?	We’ll	have	to	wait	and	see,	won’t	we?	But	I’m	pretty	sure	I	got</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	robot	part	right.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">eight	 for	 most	 people.	 He	 could	 tell	 when	 he	 needed	 sleep	 by	 a	 lack	 of concentration	and	a	frustrating	fuzziness	in	his	head.	Still,	he	hated	to	waste	time sleeping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 morning	 of	 the	 trial	 he	 woke	 from	 the	 dream	 at	 two	 in	 the	 morning, straining	to	understand	the	meaning	behind	it.	He	was	so	close	this	time.	His	rest only	lasted	a	few	hours,	and	he	lay	there	wide	awake,	wishing	that	sleep	would</p>

<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 a	 beautiful	 summer	 evening	 with	 a	 cloudless	 sky	 that	 allowed	 a million	stars	to	light	the	surface	of	Avalon.	As	he	walked	the	path	to	the	security shack,	the	night	air	helped	to	calm	his	nerves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	was	 <i class="calibre4">not</i>	looking	forward	to	this	day	of	the	trial.	The	security	arrangements were	 in	 place,	 and	 everyone’s	 place	 assigned.

<p class="calibre1">Upon	entering	the	security	shack,	he	was	met	by	Robot	Nine	and	two	of	his</p>

<p class="calibre1">charging?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	require	another	hour	and	twenty-one	minutes	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 chief	 also	 knew	 there	 would	 be	 pre-trial	 preparations	 going	 on	 in	 the prisoner’s	quarters,	“How	many	people	are	there	at	the	jail?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sid	replied,	“The	lawyer,	the	psychiatrist,	your	young	friend,	the	guard...and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	prisoner,	of	course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	Chris	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Been	there	all	night,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">What	has	gotten	into	that	kid? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	 right,”	 Al	 said,	 “You	 guys	 stay	 here	 and	 have	 one	 of	 the	 Watchers remain	 at	 the	 fence	 line	 where	 it	 was	 spotted.	 I’m	 going	 out	 and	 take	 a	 look around.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	had	been	seeing	a	lot	of	Tammy	Shoemaker	lately.	Al	was	aware	of	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">growing	 interest,	 and	 it	 worried	 him.	 It	 seemed	 Chris	 was	 getting	 attached	 to someone	who	may	or	may	not	be	a	good	person.	There	was	also	the	possibility</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	her	execution.	If	that	were	to	happen,	it	could	change	how	Chris	viewed	life forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 early	 morning	 dim	 light,	 the	 jail	 compound	 appeared	 ominous	 as	 he walked	up	to	the	gate.	The	crude	prison	was	remote	and	sitting	in	the	middle	of open	 space	 resembled	 a	 small	 fort.	 The	 ten-foot	 electrical	 fence,	 topped	 with barbed	wire,	and	the	bright	lighting	caused	the	prison	to	appear	quite	capable	of keeping	people	in	and	monsters	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guard,	a	specially	picked	colonist	familiar	with	security	protocol	saw	Al</p>
<p class="calibre1">coming	and	opened	the	gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	see	the	Riktor	a	little	while	ago?”	Al	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	know	about	any	Riktors	sir,	but	I	saw	a	ten-foot	dinosaur.	It	was	like looking	at	a	history	book.	I’ve	never	seen	a	real	one...it	about	scared	me	out	of my	boots.	One	minute	he	was	there	at	the	perimeter	fence—and	the	next—it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	man	apparently	did	not	know	the	Sansi	name	for	the	creatures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	was	he	doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	was	just	looking	around—real	quiet	like.	It	seemed	interested	in	the	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">posts	it	was	standing	by.	As	I	said,	I	only	saw	him	for	thirty	seconds	or	so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a>“How	close	did	he	get	to	the	fence?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh...about	ten	feet,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sid	 will	 be	 out	 here	 in	 about	 an	 hour.	 He’ll	 be	 responsible	 for	 getting	 the prisoner	to	the	trial	with	your	help.	In	the	meantime,	keep	your	eyes	peeled	and remember	trouble	can	come	from	any	side	of	this	facility.	All	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 acknowledged	 the	 order	 and	 Al	 continued	 inside	 to	 check	 on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tammy	and	her	guests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	entered	and	tried	to	keep	the	tone	light.	“You	guys	are	having	a	party,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	didn’t	invite	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	 not	 much	 of	 a	 party.	 We’re	 not	 very	 good	 at	 it.”	 Chris	 replied	 without humor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	didn’t	look	much	like	a	party	either,	with	everyone	sitting	around	looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">worried.	 Scattered	 around	 the	 table	 were	 lists	 of	 prospective	 witnesses	 and ledgers	of	all	the	people	on	Avalon.	It	didn’t	look	good	for	the	defense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey—come	 on	 people—this	 is	 no	 way	 to	 win	 a	 trial,”	 admonished	 Al,	 “I don’t	know	a	lot	about	courtroom	procedures,	but	it	seems	to	me	that	you	need</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	think	positive.	Show	them	Tammy	is	not	a	threat,	and	that	she	could	be	of	help to	 the	 colony.	 If	 you	 can	 manage	 that,	 you’ll	 be	 halfway	 to	 winning.	 Stress Tammy’s	 skills	 and	 talents,	 and	 concentrate	 on	 the	 crazy	 beliefs	 her	 parents drilled	into	her	since	childhood.	She	admits	she	is	guilty;	you	only	need	to	prove she	was	coerced	into	doing	what	she	did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	turned	to	Tammy	with	a	told-you-so	look	on	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Such	as	it	is,	that	is	our	plan,”	admitted	Tammy’s	lawyer,	“I	hope	you	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">part	of	the	jury...that	would	help	a	lot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 regretfully	 informed	 them,	 “My	 name	 won’t	 be	 on	 any	 of	 the	 twelve pieces	 of	 paper	 they	 pick	 out	 of	 the	 hat.	 Because	 I’m	 security,	 I	 am	 exempt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Think	positive,	though;	all	you	need	is	seven	people	that	don’t	believe	in	capital punishment,	out	of	the	almost	eight	hundred	names	in	that	rather	large	hat.	The odds	are	in	your	favor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	what	I’ve	been	trying	to	tell	her,”	Chris	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 just	 going	 to	 have	 to	 have	 faith	 in	 the	 general	 goodness	 of	 human nature,”	suggested	Al.	“Can	I	talk	to	you	for	a	minute...outside,	Chris?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	followed	him	outside,	and	Al	informed	him	of	the	Riktor	sighting.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	Chris	square	in	the	eyes	and	told	him,	“I	want	you	to	stay	alert	on	your way	to	the	auditorium,	and	stay	close	to	officer	Sal	and	the	guard.	Whatever	you do,	don’t	forget	that	many	threats	are	facing	Miss	Shoemaker	today.	If	you	have to	stay	with	her—please	be	careful—okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 left	 thinking	 he	 could	 do	 little	 to	 discourage	 him	 from	 seeing	 the	 girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Young	love	can	be	like	a	bulldozer	and	almost	unstoppable.	But	it	concerned	him</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a>that	Chris	appeared	to	be	falling	for	a	girl	that	may	not	live	long	enough	to	see her	eighteenth	birthday. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
AS	 AL	 HEADED	 BACK	 TO	 the	 security	 shack,	 scattered	 clouds	 crept	 across<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">the	 sky,	 diffused	 the	 starlight	 and	 creating	 eerie	 shadows	 that	 crept	 across	 the landscape.	He	was	thinking	of	the	unfortunate	girl	and	what	she	would	be	facing this	 day,	 and	 if	 there	 was	 anything	 more	 he	 could	 do	 to	 act	 in	 her	 defense.	 He decided	he	must	speak	for	her	at	her	tribunal.	Al	didn’t	believe	an	eye	for	an	eye would	 do	 the	 community	 any	 good.	 She	 was	 so	 young,	 and	 he	 wanted	 her	 to have	the	chance	to	prove	that	her	life	mattered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 eight	 o’clock	 in	 the	 morning,	 and	 Al	 had	 arranged	 a	 meeting	 at	 the shack	to	go	over	security	for	the	trial.	All	his	men	except	Sal	were	there	along with	Robot	Nine.	Sal	was	responsible	for	the	prisoner	and	would	deliver	her	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	auditorium	at	the	start	of	the	trial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 do	 not	 understand	 Chief	 Clark,	 the	 proceedings	 you	 are	 preparing	 are illogical,”	stated	Robot	Nine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Standing	by	the	door,	the	security	chief	asked,	“Why	do	you	say	that	robot?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	left	Earth	to	come	here	and	make	a	new	beginning.	Logic	tells	me	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	will	need	every	person,	and	more,	to	live	on	this	planet	safely.	Why	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	choose	to	kill	one	of	your	own?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 settlement	 of	 Avalon	 was	 turning	 into	 a	 bittersweet	 journey	 and	 was proving	 much	 harder	 than	 imagined.	 Still,	 Al	 believed	 its	 beauty	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">compatibility	with	human	needs	made	it	worthy	of	the	struggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That,	my	friend,	is	what	I’m	hoping	the	defense	can	get	across	to	the	jury.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 stood	 up	 and	 issued	 assignments.	 “Robot	 Nine,	 I	 want	 you	 circling	 the fence	perimeter	exclusively.”	Al	gestured	to	the	four	officers	on	the	left	side	of the	room	and	continued,	“You	four	will	join	him	and	post	yourselves	so	you	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	 in	 all	 directions	 and	 the	 rest	 of	 you	 men...and	 women,	 will	 be	 stationed inside	the	auditorium.	I’ll	fill	you	in	on	individual	posts	once	we	get	inside.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 trial	 took	 place	 in	 the	 community	 center	 auditorium	 at	 ten	 in	 the morning.	The	now	completed	center,	located	in	the	very	middle	of	Camelot,	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	the	colonists	were	understandably	proud	of.	All	sidewalks	crossed	the wide	path	surrounding	the	building,	making	it	truly	the	center	of	the	community. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Its	 steeply	 angled	 roof	 peaked	 at	 almost	 one-hundred	 feet	 tall,	 with	 the	 entire surface	 used	 to	 collect	 rainwater.	 The	 roof	 overhang	 also	 provided	 for	 a	 wrap-around	porch	that	gave	people	a	place	to	get	out	of	sun	and	rain. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>The	building	was	designed	and	used	as	a	multi-function	facility,	with	rooms that	circled	the	interior	walls	that	included	school	rooms,	several	stores,	a	clinic, and	even	a	small	church.	The	large	open	space	in	the	middle	was	for	community</p>
<p class="calibre1">gatherings.	In	the	back	of	the	building	was	a	shuttle	pad	large	enough	for	all	four shuttles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	nine	thirty	the	auditorium	was	packed.	Bleachers	lined	the	outer	walls	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	room,	with	the	prosecution	and	defense	tables,	the	jury	boxes,	and	a	judicial bench	 for	 the	 captain	 placed	 in	 the	 center.	 The	 sounds	 of	 the	 crowd	 echoed through	the	large	open	room;	buzzing	with	anticipation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sal	brought	the	prisoner	in	at	nine-fifty	and	sat	her	next	to	her	lawyer	at	the defense	table.	Another	officer	stayed	with	her	while	Sid	joined	the	audience.	The captain	entered,	sat	down	at	the	judge’s	table,	and	at	precisely	ten	o’clock	called the	 proceedings	 to	 order.	 He	 did	 not	 wish	 to	 prolong	 this	 procedure,	 so	 he minced	no	words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tammy	 Shoemaker	 is	 charged	 with	 sabotage	 and	 murder.	 How	 do	 you</p>
<p class="calibre1">plead?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tammy’s	 lawyer	 stood	 up	 and	 declared,	 “My	 client	 wishes	 to	 plead</p>
<p class="calibre1">guilty...with	extenuating	circumstances.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Effinger	showed	no	signs	of	surprise.	He	had	expected	as	much.	“All</p>
<p class="calibre1">right	then,	let’s	get	started.	Please	draw	the	names	of	the	jurors.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	young	boy	pulled	twelve	slips	from	the	hopper,	and	the	names	were	called</p>
<p class="calibre1">out.	 One	 by	 one,	 seven	 women	 and	 five	 men	 were	 sworn	 in	 and	 seated	 in	 the jury	box.	That	done,	the	prosecution	called	his	first	witness,	and	the	trial	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	murdered	girl’s	parents	were	called	to	testify;	the	psychiatrist,	the	doctor that	did	the	autopsy,	water	quality	experts,	and	the	few	people	that	knew	Tammy were	 all	 requested	 to	 say	 their	 piece.	 They	 discussed	 the	 power	 room	 fire,	 the hangar	 door	 malfunction,	 and	 of	 course,	 the	 poisoning	 of	 the	 water.	 The prosecution	attempted	to	make	her	appear	evil	while	the	defense	framed	her	as	a victim	of	a	form	of	brainwashing,	and	could	not	be	held	responsible.	The	whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">time,	Tammy	sat	there	with	a	blank	look	on	her	face,	as	if	she	couldn’t	believe this	was	happening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 all	 the	 witness’	 had	 testified,	 and	 the	 character	 references	 heard,	 the captain	asked,	“Is	there	anyone	else	that	would	like	to	speak?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	raised	his	hand,	“I	would	like	to	say	something,	Captain.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right...go	ahead	Mister	Clark.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	Al	had	to	say	was	this,	“I	just	want	to	point	out	that	we	are	setting	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">precedent	here.	If	she	is	found	guilty	and	executed,	we	will	be	following	the	path that	 believes	 taking	 the	 life	 of	 a	 criminal	 is	 a	 deterrent	 to	 serious	 crime.	 You should	know	that	there	is	no	evidence	to	support	this	conclusion.	I	don’t	believe</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>she	is	a	danger	to	the	settlement,	and	she	sincerely	wants	to	make	amends	for	her actions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 paused	 for	 a	 second,	 to	 allow	 the	 jury	 time	 to	 think	 about	 what	 he	 had said,	 “There	 is	 also	 the	 issue	 concerning	 the	 number	 of	 people	 necessary	 to colonize	 a	 planet.	 A	 lot	 of	 brilliant	 people	 got	 together	 and	 decided	 that	 one-thousand	 individuals	 is	 a	 good	 number	 to	 start	 a	 colony.	 We	 are	 down	 to	 eight hundred	and	thirty	colonists,	which	in	my	book,	is	pushing	the	limits.	We	need</p>
<p class="calibre1">every	person	we	can	get	to	make	this	settlement	a	success.	We	can’t	afford	to	kill her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	 Effinger	 frowned	 at	 Al,	 so	 he	 finished	 with,	 “That’s	 all	 I	 have	 to say.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	rain	started	around	two	o’clock.	A	slow,	steady	rain	that	could	be	heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">tapping	 on	 the	 roof	 while	 the	 jury	 listened	 to	 the	 testimonies.	 The	 captain recognized	Tammy	and	asked	her,	“Do	you	have	anything	to	say.	Would	you	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	come	and	be	heard?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	hesitantly	said,	“Yes...I	would.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tammy	stood	up	and	moved	to	the	center	of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Most	of	my	life	they	told	me	that	the	colony	ships	are	war	vessels	sent	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	conquer	new	planets.	They	are	loaded	with	Earth’s	elite	and	wealthy	and	use</p>
<p class="calibre1">biological	weapons	to	wipe	the	world	clean	of	native	people	to	make	the	planet</p>
<p class="calibre1">suitable	 for	 occupation.	 My	 parents	 made	 me	 believe	 what	 they	 said	 was	 the truth.	I	now	believe	I	was	being	deceived.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tammy	knew	that	what	she	said	next	could	make	the	difference	between	life</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	death.	She	composed	herself	and	continued,	“I	am	very	sorry	for	what	I’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">done.	 I	 thought	 I	 was	 earning	 my	 way	 to	 heaven,	 but	 I	 was	 making	 myself	 a place	in	hell.	Please—I	want	to	live—so	I	can	do	what	I	can	to	help	this	colony survive	and	grow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 defense	 and	 prosecution	 made	 their	 closing	 statements,	 and	 the	 jury retired	 to	 one	 of	 the	 classrooms	 to	 deliberate.	 Tammy’s	 fate	 was	 now	 in	 the hands	of	the	jury. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sunset	 came,	 and	 the	 rain	 got	 harder,	 and	 louder.	 So	 loud,	 in	 fact,	 that	 it began	to	get	hard	to	hear	inside	the	courtroom.	Al	retreated	from	the	noise	and stepped	outside	onto	the	porch	to	await	the	verdict. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	watchers	were	excellent	surveillance	tools,	with	only	a	few	limitations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 Riktors	 were	 a	 species	 of	 cold-blooded	 dinosaur,	 and	 the	 drone’s	 night vision	 had	 trouble	 tracking	 an	 animal	 that	 took	 on	 the	 heat	 signatures	 of	 its surroundings.	The	added	restriction	that	the	high-tech	drones	could	see	little	in	a downpour	 compounded	 the	 problem.	 It	 was	 pitch	 black	 and	 raining	 cats	 and dogs,	and	the	Watchers	were	pretty	much	useless. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>“There	 is	 a	 break	 in	 the	 fence,”	 Robot	 Nine	 reported,	 “Multiple	 tracks leading	to	the	confinement	facility.	I	am	pursuing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">A	silent	alarm	went	off	in	Al’s	head	to	match	the	screeching	from	his	pocket. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">He	pulled	out	his	pad	and	said,	“I	need	to	know	how	many	there	are	and	where. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Report	quickly	Robot	Nine;	we	don’t	have	much	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	had	considered	this	scenario.	Unfortunately,	it	didn’t	include	the	rain.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned	and	ran	back	into	the	building	yelling	into	his	communicator,	“Everybody inside!	You	officers	outside	round	everybody	up	and	get	inside	quickly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stopped	in	front	of	the	captain	and	yelled	over	the	rain,	“Can	you	fly	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	Tobias?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 friend	 replied	 confidently,	 “Son—I	 can	 fly	 in	 anything—what	 is	 it	 you need?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Follow	me.	I’ll	explain	once	we	are	in	the	shuttle.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	made	their	way	to	the	back,	exited	the	building,	and	ran	to	the	nearest</p>
<p class="calibre1">shuttle.	 The	 captain	 worked	 the	 door	 lock	 in	 record	 time,	 and	 they	 climbed	 in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sixty	seconds	after	receiving	the	alarm	and	Al	was	closing	the	shuttle	door	to	the pouring	rain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	have	split	up,	sir,”	the	robot’s	voice	reported,	“The	tracks	indicate	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">least	four...possibly	more.	The	intruders	appear	to	be	headed	for	the	community center.	 I	 am	 following	 the	 tracks	 of	 two	 reptiles	 moving	 to	 the	 east	 side	 of	 the settlement.	Be	advised;	I	am	having	trouble	navigating	the	soft	ground,	and	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward	velocities	have	decreased	considerably.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	realized	the	situation	was	quickly	becoming	serious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tobias,	can	you	see	well	enough	to	stay	fifteen	feet	off	the	ground?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 may	 not	 be	 able	 to	 see	 what’s	 directly	 below	 us,	 but	 I	 can	 use	 the instruments	to	keep	us	at	whatever	height	you	want,”	replied	the	captain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	need	you	to	say	the	phrase	to	enhance	my	abilities.	It	seems	I	can’t	make	it work	alone.	Believe	me;	I	have	tried.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	we	do	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	gonna	fly	over	them,	and	then	I’m	gonna	shoot-em.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	captain	trusted	Al’s	judgment,	and	he	didn’t	have	any	better	ideas.	His</p>
<p class="calibre1">simple	reply	was	a	rising,	“O...kay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	started	the	shuttle	while	Al	grabbed	the	two	rifles	he	had	stashed	under	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">seat—just	in	case.	He	was	determined	not	to	be	caught	unprepared	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	ready	Mister	Clark?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ready	as	I’ll	ever	be...I	guess.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tobias	spoke	the	phrase:	“The	metal	of	a	man	is	judged	by	what	is	inside.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 the	 second	 time,	 Al	 repeated	 the	 phrase	 and	 felt	 his	 systems	 ramp	 up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	feeling	of	power	filled	his	senses,	his	hearing	rose	sharply	and	then	settled</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a>down,	 and	 his	 sight	 became	 equivalent	 to	 the	 eyes	 of	 an	 eagle.	 Once	 again,	 he was	an	enhanced	human. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tobias	asked,	“Are	you	all	right,	Al?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	never	felt	so	right.	Let’s	go	and	find	us	some	dinosaurs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 threw	 the	 shuttle	 door	 open,	 and	 the	 captain	 lifted	 off,	 swerving	 in	 the direction	 of	 the	 marauding	 predators.	 Al	 wrapped	 his	 leg	 around	 a	 pole	 and leaned	out	of	the	opening	in	the	aircraft	to	find	a	target	for	his	rifle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	you	see	anything	Captain?”	Al	yelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	see	enough.	Something	is	going	on	ahead—be	ready.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	 flashed	 by	 under	 the	 shuttle,	 and	 the	 captain	 performed	 the sweetest	 one-eighty	 that	 Al	 had	 ever	 seen.	 Five	 seconds	 later,	 Al	 was	 above	 a full-sized	 adult	 Riktor	 running	 full-tilt	 towards	 the	 community	 center,	 with	 the shuttle	only	feet	above	its	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	 his	 vantage	 point,	 it	 was	 an	 easy	 shot.	 He	 fired	 three	 times	 as	 fast	 as the	rifle	would	allow	and	the	creature	fell	hard;	disappearing	in	the	mist	behind them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Effinger	was	one	with	his	machine,	and	the	amazing	little	craft	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything	he	asked	of	it.	Tobias	used	his	instruments	and	data	pad	to	find	them, while	 Al	 shot	 the	 beasts	 from	 above.	 The	 pouring	 rain	 with	 the	 almost	 silent shuttle	 flying	 above	 made	 them	 easy	 targets.	 They	 didn’t	 even	 know	 what	 hit them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 third	 beast	 caught	 on,	 though,	 and	 stopped	 his	 rampage	 to	 watch	 the spacecraft	 fly	 over	 his	 head.	 Al	 reminded	 himself	 these	 were	 not	 stupid creatures.	 Al	 motioned	 for	 the	 captain	 to	 lower	 the	 shuttle,	 and	 he	 jumped	 six feet	to	the	ground.	The	Riktor	was	livid,	and	when	it	advanced	on	him	he	shot	it several	 times	 in	 the	 head,	 and	 it	 went	 down	 for	 the	 final	 time.	 The	 captain brought	 the	 shuttle	 back	 down;	 Al	 jumped	 in,	 and	 they	 went	 looking	 for	 more targets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	Riktor	had	a	quarry	of	its	own.	A	man	and	woman	tried	to	make	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	community	center	and	were	caught	by	one	of	the	enraged	predators	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 and	 the	 captain	 came	 on	 the	 distressing	 scene.	 It	 was	 too	 late	 for	 the unfortunate	colonists,	but	the	captain	and	Al	still	had	to	deal	with	the	murderous animal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 time	 Al	 didn’t	 wait	 until	 the	 captain	 lowered	 the	 shuttle.	 As	 they	 flew over,	 he	 dropped	 his	 rifle	 into	 the	 shuttle	 and	 jumped	 on	 top	 of	 the	 rampaging animal.	While	he	rode	the	beast	neck,	he	pulled	the	always	handy	pistol	from	its holster—and	shot	it	at	close	range.	Al	had	to	jump	to	keep	from	being	crushed</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	its	fall. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>The	 captain	 picked	 up	 the	 blood	 splattered	 Al,	 and	 they	 resumed	 their	 hunt once	 again.	 There	 was	 nothing	 he	 could	 do	 for	 the	 two	 people	 who	 had	 given their	lives	to	Avalon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 fifth	 beast	 surprised	 them.	 It	 must	 have	 heard	 or	 seen	 his	 fellows	 fall, and	 overcome	 with	 rage,	 he	 hunkered	 down	 and	 jumped,	 grabbing	 the	 landing skid	of	the	aircraft.	The	shuttle	leaned	so	far	over	that	Al	slid	out	the	door	and fell	to	the	ground	fifteen	feet	below.	Either	by	miracle	or	advanced	technology, Al	 managed	 to	 land	 on	 his	 feet,	 roll,	 and	 bounce	 back	 up	 to	 run	 after	 the departing	shuttle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 the	 rain	 pounding	 on	 his	 head,	 and	 his	 feet	 slipping	 in	 the	 mud,	 he realized	he	could	not	catch	up.	Al	could	not	help.	Fortunately,	the	captain	had	an idea	of	his	own.	He	slowly	took	the	shuttle	and	the	creature	straight	up	forty	feet or	so	and	stopped.	The	shuttle	was	listing	badly	and	was	almost	sideways	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	weight	of	the	beast	when	Al	saw	the	captain	lean	out	the	door	and	shoot	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	animal	screamed,	let	go,	and	fell	to	the	muddy	ground	below,	which	caused</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 shuttle	 to	 roll	 almost	 all	 the	 way	 around	 until	 the	 gyroscopes	 could	 get	 it level	again.	After	a	moment,	the	captain	popped	his	head	out	the	pilot’s	window, smiled,	and	gave	the	‘Okay’	symbol. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	had	taken	out	five	adult	intruders.	Al	thought,  <i class="calibre4">the	beasts	were	trying	to</i> <i class="calibre4">wipe	us	out	and	came	in	force. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 he	 remembered	 that	 Riktors	 hunted	 in	 pairs.  <i class="calibre4">There	 was	 at	 least	 one</i> <i class="calibre4">more. </i></p><p class="calibre1">

THE	 CREATURES	 SEEMED	 determined	 to	 make	 it	 to	 the	 human	 gathering<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">place,	and	that	is	where	they	found	what	they	hoped	was	the	last	assailant.	When they	landed,	the	massive	wooden	doors	to	the	community	center	were	splintered</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	laying	on	the	floor	just	inside	the	auditorium.	Standing	at	the	hole	in	the	wall was	 the	 back	 of	 a	 powerful	 creature	 advancing	 on	 two	 people	 in	 the	 middle	 of the	room.	He	could	not	use	his	rifle.	The	community	gathering	place	was	full	of people	huddling	at	the	top	of	the	bleachers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	Al	stepped	to	the	side,	he	realized	the	beast	was	threatening	Chris	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tammy.	Some	idiot	had	handcuffed	her	to	the	table,	and	Chris	was	doing	all	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	to	pull	the	table—and	Tammy—away	from	the	beast.	Al	realized,  <i class="calibre4">I	need	to</i> <i class="calibre4">get	it	outside	where	I	can	deal	with	it. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">He	decided	that	keeping	his	secret	was	secondary	to	saving	his	friend	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">girl.	The	decision	caused	him	to	run	up	to	the	monster	from	behind—and	kick	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	feeling.	Hard	enough	to	leave	a	good	size	wound	in	the	Riktors	leg	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a>intent	 of	 getting	 its	 attention	 and	 luring	 it	 back	 through	 the	 door.	 It	 looked around	to	see	what	had	assaulted	it	and	promptly	knocked	Al	into	the	bleachers</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	a	flip	of	its	tail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 untangled	 himself	 from	 the	 wreckage	 of	 the	 bleacher	 seats	 and	 began screaming	and	yelling	at	the	Riktor	over	the	sound	of	the	rain.	He	headed	for	the door	with	the	thundering	beast	right	behind	him.	On	his	way	by,	a	quick	thinking Officer	Sid	tossed	Al	his	rifle,	replacing	the	one	Al	dropped	on	his	flight	to	the bleachers.	It	was	an	excellent	throw,	and	it	probably	saved	Al’s	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	outside,	it	was	a	simple	matter	of	rolling	to	face	the	opposite	direction</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 shooting	 the	 beast	 in	 the	 head	 several	 times	 before	 it	 had	 time	 to	 tear	 his head	off.	The	creature	fell	into	the	mud	with	a	final	scream—and	died	too	close for	 comfort.	 The	 apex	 predator	 was	 never	 threatened	 by	 death	 and	 died	 with	 a distinct	look	of	puzzlement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al,	 covered	 in	 mud	 and	 dripping	 with	 blood,	 took	 a	 moment	 to	 collect himself.	 He	 walked	 back	 through	 the	 broken	 doorway	 into	 the	 auditorium	 and told	his	men	to	pair	up	and	search	the	entire	compound	for	more	intruders	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">check	for	casualties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 had	 managed	 to	 survive	 the	 worst	 attack	 yet.	 The	 only	 problem	 was that	this	time—everyone	in	the	auditorium	knew	that	Al	Clark	was	not	normal. </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
THE	 FIRST	 THING	 AL	 did	 was	 go	 over	 and	 shake	 Sid’s	 hand.	 He	 told	 him, <p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“That	was	some	throw,	Sid.	If	I	ever	need	someone	to	watch	my	back,	you’ll	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	the	top	of	my	list.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Officer	Sid	looked	down	and	smiled,	“I	didn’t	take	the	time	to	think	about	it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it	just	happened—but	I’m	glad	it	worked.	You	did	way	more	than	I	could	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 better	 than	 any...  <i class="calibre4">person, </i> I’ve	 ever	 seen.	 Don’t	 worry,	 sir,	 no	 matter	 what happens	I’ve	got	your	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	Sid,	I	appreciate	that.	I	might	need	all	the	friends	I	can	find	after this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Other	than	a	few	cuts	on	Tammy’s	wrist	from	the	stupid	handcuffs,	she	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	were	okay.	Robot	Nine	was	found	lying	in	the	mud	with	his	arms	broken,	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">significant	dent	in	his	body,	and	he	was	repeating,	“Sorry...sorry,”	over	and	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	 one	 in	 the	 auditorium	 was	 injured,	 save	 for	 cuts	 and	 bruises	 from scrambling	up	the	bleachers.	A	man	and	a	woman	were	found	just	outside,	slain</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	they	tried	to	get	to	the	community	center.	It	was	something	Al	and	the	captain would	have	to	learn	to	accept.	Other	than	that,	the	colony	had	survived	relatively unscathed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>Now	that	the	danger	was	over,	the	rain	reduced	itself	to	a	soft	drizzle.	Fate changed	direction	and	allowed	the	tension	to	drain	from	the	atmosphere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	handcuffed	her	to	the	table?”	Al	wanted	to	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	assigned	to	stay	with	her	during	the	trial	answered	hesitantly,	“I	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">sir...I	wanted	to	make	sure	she	didn’t	make	a	break	for	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 reply	 increased	 Al’s	 anger,	 and	 he	 growled	 at	 the	 man,	 “Where	 is	 she going	to	go?	We	are	in	the	middle	of	nowhere	and	on	a	dinosaur	infested	planet</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	goodness	sake.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	sorry	sir,	I	didn’t	think.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	damn	right	you	didn’t	think.	I	didn’t	ask	for	you	to	handcuff	her—</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	should	have	asked	me	first.	Do	you	realize	you	almost	caused	the	deaths	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">two	people	because	of	your	lack	of	judgment?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 was	 obviously	 embarrassed	 and	 regretful.	 He	 replied,	 “Yes	 sir,	 I do...and	they	would	have	been	killed	if	not	for	you,	sir.	I	still	can’t	believe	you stopped	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al,	 feeling	 it	 best	 to	 postpone	 any	 further	 conversation;	 turned	 and	 walked away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 starting	 to	 register	 with	 the	 crowd	 that	 something	 extraordinary	 had happened	 right	 before	 their	 eyes,	 and	 questions	 were	 forming	 in	 their	 minds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People	were	standing	around	murmuring	to	each	other,	trying	to	make	sense	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	extraordinary	developments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	man	yelled	out,	addressing	his	question	at	Al,	“How	did	you	do	that?	You</p>
<p class="calibre1">put	your	foot	into	that	animal	and	then	ran	faster	than	it	did	to	get	outside.	How is	that	possible?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone	else	joined	in,	“How	 <i class="calibre4">did	</i> you	do	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	somewhere	in	the	back	of	the	crowd,	a	voice	was	heard.	“He	can’t	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">human.	He	must	be	one	of	those...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	 Effinger	 saw	 that	 things	 were	 getting	 out	 of	 hand.	 He	 stood	 at	 the judge’s	table,	held	up	his	hands,	and	said	in	a	commanding	voice,	“Everybody!	I think	 we’ve	 had	 enough	 excitement	 for	 one	 night.	 The	 threat	 is	 over,	 and	 it	 is late.	 We	 will	 have	 to	 finish	 the	 trial	 in	 a	 day	 or	 two.	 Go	 home	 and	 get	 some sleep.	We’ll	reconvene	and	finish	this	after	we	clean-up	and	make	the	camp	safe again.	 All	 senior	 staff,	 I	 need	 to	 speak	 with	 you	 now.	 Everyone	 else	 is	 to	 go home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 gathered	 with	 his	 men,	 told	 half	 of	 them	 to	 go	 home,	 and	 ordered	 the remaining	 half	 to	 stand	 watch	 until	 morning.	 The	 captain	 assembled	 with	 the senior	 staff	 and	 gave	 the	 necessary	 orders	 to	 have	 the	 Riktors	 disposed	 of,	 to repair	the	fence,	and	to	begin	repairs	to	the	damage	caused	by	the	attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a>When	Al	finally	had	time,	he	cleaned	himself	up	as	best	he	could	and	went	to find	 Chris	 and	 Tammy	 sitting	 at	 the	 defense	 table,	 patiently	 waiting	 until someone	could	escort	the	prisoner	back	to	her	cage.	By	this	time	the	community</p>
<p class="calibre1">center	was	almost	empty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	walked	up	and	said,	“Come	on	you	two,	I’ll	walk	you	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	the	last	to	leave	and	didn’t	bother	closing	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	two	okay?”	Al	asked	as	they	walked	out	to	the	jail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tammy	 answered,	 “Never	 mind	 us.	 How	 are	 you	 doing?	 You	 must	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">flown	forty	feet	and	then	landed	in	the	bleachers.	That	had	to	hurt!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	wasn’t	as	bad	as	it	must	have	looked.	I’m	all	right.	The	bleachers	broke</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	fall,”	Al	said.	While	he	tried	to	make	light	of	the	conflict	he	gave	a	discrete warning	 glance	 to	 Chris.	 Maybe	 he	 could	 still	 get	 away	 with	 saying	 it	 was	 an adrenaline	 rush,	 or	 maybe	 people	 would	 settle	 down	 and	 decide,	 with	 all	 the excitement,	they	had	seen	things	they	couldn’t	possibly	have	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tammy	 looked	 up	 and	 asked,	 “Do	 you	 mind	 if	 I	 ask	 a	 question,	 Mister Clark?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	don’t	mind—go	ahead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	there,	not	ten	feet	away	from	its	open	mouth...and	then	it	was	gone.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 right	 in	 front	 of	 me,	 and	 then	 seconds	 later	 you	 were	 shooting	 it	 in	 the courtyard.	How	 <i class="calibre4">did</i>	you	do	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 question	 made	 him	 see	 that	 keeping	 his	 secret	 would	 prove	 next	 to impossible.	The	colonists	were	smart	people,	and	it	dawned	on	Al	that	he	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	fool	them	for	long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	long	story,	Miss	Shoemaker,	but	yes.	I’m	not	an	ordinary	guy.	I’m	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">human	in	a	robotic	body.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	a	robot?	Isn’t	that	like...bad?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 thought	 for	 a	 second,	 smiled	 a	 little,	 and	 replied,	 “Not	 from	 where	 I’m standing.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">Kira	knew	that	something	was	very	wrong.	She	awoke	from	her	bed	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sound	of	screaming	people	and	the	roar	of	monsters	in	the	distance.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">first	 person	 she	 woke	 was	 Toji,	 and	 in	 a	 breathless	 voice	 she	 told	 him,	 “The Riktors	are	attacking	the	Kuthra!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still	 half	 asleep,	 he	 listened	 for	 a	 moment	 and	 asked,	 “Is	 that	 coming	 from their	village?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	 she	 said,	 “I	 think	 our	 friends	 are	 in	 trouble.	 The	 Riktors	 sound	 very angry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	should	we	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	must	try	to	help	them. </p>

<p class="calibre1">If	we	gather	enough	Sansi,	we	can. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	decision	made,	they	woke	the	elders	first,	they	in	turn	woke	the	rest	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	cave	dwellers.	A	group	of	twelve	strong	warriors	was	assembled,	and	armed</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	their	best	spears	and	knives.	Then	they	rushed	to	aid	their	gods,	with	Kira and	Toji	in	the	lead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	long	time	ago	that	her	people	had	fought	a	Riktor.	Toji’s	grandfather</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	brought	one	down	many	years	ago,	but	it	had	cost	the	life	of	four	Sansi.	The tanned	 hide	 from	 the	 beast	 was	 all	 they	 received	 as	 reward.

<p class="calibre1">The	rain	diminished	to	a	light	drizzle	while	they	made	their	way	through	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dark	 forest	 in	 the	 quick	 and	 silent	 style	 learned	 from	 their	 ancestors.	 Kira	 had been	 outside	 after	 dark	 only	 a	 few	 times	 in	 her	 life,	 and	 she	 found	 it	 quite disconcerting.	The	cloud	cover	and	rain	made	it	especially	dark,	and	it	was	hard to	see	where	they	were	stepping	as	the	group	moved	as	fast	as	they	could,	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	the	redeeming	advantage	of	youth	in	their	favor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 lights	 of	 the	 place	  <i class="calibre4">where	 they	 kept	 the	 bad	 Kuthra’s	 </i> came	 into	 view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because	 of	 the	 angry	 roar	 they	 heard	 as	 they	 approached	 the	 compound,	 they were	 not	 surprised	 when	 lights	 were	 blocked	 by	 the	 silhouette	 of	 a	 towering monster.	Outside	the	line	of	magic	sticks	that	protected	the	gods,	the	taller	than</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>ten-foot	 beast	 paced	 back	 and	 forth,	 becoming	 more	 and	 more	 agitated	 as	 it listened	to	the	destruction	of	his	pack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 warriors	 were	 resolute.	 They	 circled	 to	 both	 sides	 where	 the	 lights helped	 to	 reveal	 their	 prey	 and	 began	 throwing	 their	 spears,	 aiming	 to	 get	 as close	 as	 they	 could	 to	 something	 vital.	 Jumping	 and	 yelling	 they	 stayed	 just outside	 the	 creature's	 reach	 and	 launched	 their	 stone-pointed	 spears	 with	 an accuracy	that	surprised	even	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Riktor	they	fought	was	a	large	elder	creature,	with	a	roar	that	shook	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">trees	 nearby.	 His	 tail	 thrashed	 and	 slapped	 the	 ground	 within	 inches	 of	 the always	 moving	 warriors.	 The	 Sansi	 were	 nimble,	 and	 their	 tactics	 relentless, harassing	 the	 beast	 and	 generating	 enough	 fear	 that	 it	 retreated	 into	 the	 human settlement	to	escape.	It	crossed	the	downed	section	of	the	fence	and	headed	into Camelot;	towards	the	jail. </p><p class="calibre1">

<p class="calibre1">Al’s	enhancements	had	worn	off	hours	ago,	and	with	all	the	excitement	and</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	 Sansi	 were	 all	 around	 it	 and	 still	 driving	 their	 spears	 into	 its	 blood stained	hide	when	it	did	something	strange.

He	 shook	 his	 massive head,	trying	to	clear	the	growing	lethargy	from	his	mind.	The	Riktor	was	dying, and	it	didn’t	understand,	even	as	it	fell,	that	the	fight	was	lost. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“I	have	to	tell	you,	Chris;	it’s	like	nothing	you	can	imagine.	It	makes	me	feel like	 I	 can	 do	 anything.	 I	 had	 to	 be	 careful	 after	 the	 attack,	 that	 I	 didn’t accidentally	hurt	someone	until	it	wore	off.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	learn	anything	new?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 smiled	 at	 the	 memory	 of	 the	 feeling.	 “It	 seems	 I	 can	 see	 pretty	 well	 in pouring	rain—in	the	dark.	My	legs	can	survive	a	fifteen-foot	drop—with	no	ill</p>
<p class="calibre1">effects,	and	my	foot	is	a	lethal	weapon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	 I’ll	 have	 to	 remember	 not	 to	 ask	 you	 to	 kick	 me...if	 I	 do	 something stupid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	walked	for	a	while,	both	deep	in	thought.	Chris	remembered	the	look</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	Tammy’s	face,	as	she	watched	Al	assault	the	monster	and	lead	it	outside.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembered	the	entire	village	watching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	think	this	is	going	to	cause	you	trouble?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Up	 until	 I	 went	 into	 the	 auditorium	 to	 get	 what	 I	 thought	 was	 the	 last creature,	I	think	no	one	would	have	been	the	wiser.	Now,	with	all	that	happened, I’ll	have	some	explaining	to	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So...what	 <i class="calibre4">are</i>	you	going	to	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	this	point,	Chris,	I	have	no	idea.	I	have	a	feeling	when	everybody	gathers</p>
<p class="calibre1">together	 to	 finish	 this	 trial;	 the	 village	 will	 be	 judging	 two	 people—Tammy Shoemaker	and	Al	Clark. </p><p class="calibre1">

<a id="p165"></a>THINGS	 WERE	 DIFFERENT	 for	 Al	 after	 that	 night.	 People	 walking	 on	 the same	sidewalk	as	he	would	turn	and	go	the	other	way.	He	would	sit	down	at	a<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">table	 in	 the	 cafeteria,	 and	 people	 would	 appear	 uncomfortable,	 and	 move	 to	 a different	table.	The	colonists	that	weren’t	afraid	of	him	had	a	thousand	questions, and	 he	 grew	 tired	 of	 trying	 to	 explain	 himself.	 He	 began	 to	 throw	 himself	 into his	 work.	 He	 gathered	 his	 men,	 and	 told	 them	 his	 entire	 story,	 leaving	 nothing out.	They	assured	him	they	were	there	for	him	and	would	do	what	they	could	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	his	life	a	little	easier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	one	thing	that	didn’t	change	was	the	support	from	his	real	friends.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1">gathered	to	discuss	his	situation	the	night	after	the	attack,	to	let	him	know	they would	do	everything	they	could	to	persuade	the	colonists	that	Al	was	not	a	threat to	the	colony,	but	an	asset. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elizabeth	 Morris	 converted	 her	 two	 habitats,	 placed	 end	 to	 end,	 into	 a comfortable	place	to	live—or	visit.	She	kept	the	onboard	parts	printers	busy	on the	  <i class="calibre4">Excalibur</i>	 producing	 window	 shades,	 louvered	 cabinets,	 dishes,	 and numerous	other	home	furnishings.	Cloth	curtains	framed	each	window,	ready	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 closed	 when	 the	 sun	 became	 annoying,	 and	 as	 most	 women	 seem	 to	 enjoy having	pillows	about,	there	were	plenty	to	go	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	sit	with	you	when	you	go	to	breakfast...if	you	want?”	volunteered	Liz, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually,	I	like	that	idea.	They’ll	know	I’m	on	your	side.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	is	an	excellent	idea,”	Ana	said	in	agreement.	“How	about	we	all	join</p>
<p class="calibre1">you.	We	should	probably	get	together	for	all	our	meals.	We	can’t	have	you	eating alone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kayla,	 Cody,	 and	 the	 captain	 agreed.	 Chris	 was	 at	 the	 jail	 keeping	 Tammy company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liz	 confessed	 with	 a	 hint	 of	 a	 smile,	 “I	 was	 hoping	 to	 have	 a	 nice	 quiet breakfast,	just	Al	and	I.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cody	laughed	and	said	with	his	Haitian	accent,	“Now	Elizabeth,	there	will	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">plenty	 of	 time	 for	 that	 once	 we	 convince	 the	 good	 people	 of	 Camelot	 that	 Al Clark	is	not	a	bad	man	and	someone	to	fear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	made	arrangements	to	meet	for	breakfast,	and	eventually,	everyone	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	goodbyes	and	left	to	go	to	their	homes—except	for	Liz	and	Al,	who	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">left	sitting	side-by-side	on	a	love	seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	serious	about	having	breakfast;	just	you	and	me.	I	like	you,	Al—as	a</p>

<p class="calibre1">“You’re	going	to	make	me	blush.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	you...blush	I	mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	so,	but	it	sure	feels	like	I	should	be.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a>They	sat	for	a	while	unsure	of	what	to	say,	until	Al	volunteered,	“I	like	you too	Liz,	and	I	have	been	wanting	to	spend	more	time	with	you.”	A	crooked	smile</p>
<p class="calibre1">greeted	her	glance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	things	got	too	awkward,	Al	stood	up	and	said,	“Umm...I	need	to	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">going.	I’ve	got	to	get	up	early.”	He	was	quickly	becoming	uncomfortable,	and	he knew	it	showed.	Nevertheless,	he	gave	her	a	peck	on	the	cheek	before	he	made</p>

<p class="calibre1">it	careening	down	a	hill,	rolled	over	a	fence	post,	and	opened	the	electronic	fence for	 their	 invasion.	 It	 required	 almost	 a	 week	 to	 accomplish	 the	 repairs	 brought about	 by	 the	 rampaging	 creatures.	 To	 bury	 the	 Riktor	 carcasses	 alone	 required two	days,	and	the	replacement	of	the	fence	added	to	that	total.	The	colony	took the	time	to	mourn	and	bury	the	unlucky	couple	that	died	seeking	safety,	and	the Camelot	cemetery	grew	a	little	larger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seven	days	after	the	attack	of	the	Riktors,	the	villagers	gathered	and	brought</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	long	anticipated	trial	to	a	conclusion,	with	a	somewhat	anti-climactic	ending. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tammy	Shoemaker	was	found	guilty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	determined	she	had	willfully	sabotaged	their	ship,	threatening	all	their lives	 and	 had	 to	 be	 made	 accountable.	 However,	 the	 testimony	 given	 by	 the defense	gave	the	jury	pause	about	recommending	capital	punishment,	and	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	discussion,	she	was	sentenced	to	live	a	life	of	community	service.	Which</p>
<p class="calibre1">ironically	is	what	all	the	colonists	agreed	to	when	they	joined	the	expedition.	In her	case,	though,	she	would	wear	an	ankle	bracelet	to	record	her	movements,	and assist	anyone	that	had	need	of	her	skills.	She	would	be	free;	with	restrictions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	 after	 Tammy	 was	 escorted	 out,	 to	 be	 fitted	 for	 her	 anklet,	 the	 settlers continued	to	sit	in	the	bleachers.	There	was	another	issue	they	wanted	addressed, and	they	seemed	reluctant	to	leave	until	their	leaders	addressed	their	questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	stayed	behind,	feeling	something	serious	was	about	to	happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 could	 hear	 the	 whispers	 and	 the	 muted	 discussions	 of	 the	 crowd	 as	 they worked	up	the	nerve	to	speak	aloud.	Finally,	one	gentleman	stood	up,	raised	his voice,	and	asked	the	question	uppermost	on	the	settler’s	minds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mister	Clark...are	you	human?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	question	had	haunted	Al	a	lot	lately,	and	he	was	glad	to	finally	be	able</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	bare	his	soul,	“Yes	sir,	I	am	a	human	being—fitted	with	a	robotic	body.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t	that	another	way	of	saying	 <i class="calibre4">cyborg</i>?”	a	woman	yelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a>The	 term	 Cyborg	 promoted	 fear.	 Science	 fiction	 dramas	 always	 depicted them	as	killers	and	destroyers.	The	combination	of	man	and	machine	is	usually</p>
<p class="calibre1">portrayed	as	an	experiment	gone	wrong;	creating	man-made	monsters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	think	of	myself	as	a	cyborg.	I	guess,	by	some	definitions,	I	might	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">considered	 one.	 I	 really	 don’t	 know.	 I	 think	 of	 myself	 as	 a	 human	 with	 a prosthetic	body.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have	you	ever	hurt	anybody...even	accidentally?”	she	pressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 decided	 it	 was	 time.	 Somehow,	 he	 needed	 to	 make	 them	 understand	 he had	 their	 best	 interests	 at	 heart.	 He	 simplified	 his	 situation	 for	 everyone	 by telling	them	his	life’s	story—the	parts	he	knew	at	least.	He	started	with	his	rude awakening,	and	for	thirty	minutes	was	given	their	undivided	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Al	 ended	 his	 confession	 with	 the	 dispatching	 of	 the	 dinosaur	 they	 all witnessed.	He	explained	his	strengths	as	 <i class="calibre4">somewhat</i>	better	than	normal,	and	why he	believed	it	necessary	to	keep	his	abilities	secret.	For	his	own	safety,	he	made no	mention	of	his	dual-mode	system	or	the	fact	that	his	power-pack	was	limited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	he	finished	speaking,	the	building	was	so	quiet	you	could	have	heard	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">nail	 drop	 on	 a	 dirt	 floor.	 It	 was	 a	 lot	 of	 information	 to	 process,	 and	 the	 silence lasted	for	a	good	minute	or	two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	picked	this	opportunity	to	defend	his	friend,	“Chief	Al	Clark	is	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	closest	friends,	and	I	would	trust	my	life	to	him.	As	a	matter	of	fact—I	have. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	has	always	come	through	for	me.	If	I	were	ever	in	trouble,	he	would	be	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">first	person	I’d	turn	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	 by	 one	 his	 friends	 stood	 up	 and	 expressed	 their	 feelings	 for	 Al.	 How they	 trusted	 him	 to	 know	 the	 right	 thing	 to	 do	 and	 the	 fact	 that	 he	 was	 a	 good man	 with	 extraordinary	 abilities.	 Chris,	 Ana,	 Kayla,	 Liz,	 Doctor	 Cody,	 Doctor Florida,	 and	 a	 few	 others	 had	 their	 share	 of	 good	 things	 to	 say.	 Robot	 Nine assured	them,	“You	have	nothing	to	fear	from	Al	Clark.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	they	completed	their	statements,	the	captain	took	his	turn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mister	 Clark	 was	 an	 experiment	 that	 went	 right.	 I’m	 sure	 that	 Doctor Hawthorne,	his	creator—if	he	were	alive—would	consider	Al’s	transformation	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">complete	success.	As	an	officer,	I	have	never	worked	with	better.	As	a	person,	I consider	him	a	trusted	friend.	The	people	fortunate	enough	to	call	him	friend—</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	lucky	indeed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Captain	Effinger	thought	for	a	few	seconds,	took	a	deep	breath,	and	added, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	all	come	from	a	world	full	of	prejudice	that	has	stunted	human	growth	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">thousands	of	years.	Here,	I	believed	we	had	gotten	past	all	that	and	could	treat each	other	with	respect	as	equals.	Al	is	here,	he	is	one-of-a-kind,	and	we	should thank	 our	 lucky	 stars	 that	 he	 is	 the	 man	 he	 is.	 If	 not	 for	 him,	 there	 is	 a	 good chance	we	would	 <i class="calibre4">all</i>	be	dead.	Keep	that	in	mind	as	you	pass	judgment	on	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>Al	 Clark	 felt	 pretty	 good	 when	 he	 left	 that	 crowded	 meetinghouse, surrounded	 by	 his	 friends.	 They	 shielded	 him	 from	 the	 many	 questions	 and protected	 him	 from	 the	 few	 that	 were	 still	 openly	 hostile.	 A	 man	 can	 also	 be judged	by	the	strength	of	his	friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Things	got	slowly	better	after	that.	He	felt	more	at	home.	He	had	no	secrets, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 he	 had	 the	 added	 benefit	 of	 friends	 he	 could	 trust	 to	 stand	 by	 him.	 How much	more	can	a	man	want? </p><p class="calibre1">
</p><p class="calibre5">****</p>
THE	MONTHS	PASSED,	and	Camelot	became	a	village.	There	was	much	to	do, <p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	colonists	learned	to	work	together.	The	Sansi	wanted	to	repay	the	Kuthra for	 saving	 them	 from	 the	 Riktors—and	 brought	 Kira	 as	 a	 sacrifice;	 which	 the gods	graciously	declined.	Their	mercy	made	Kira	and	her	clan	both	grateful	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">relieved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	natives	confirmed	that	the	Riktors	in	the	immediate	area	had	been	wiped</p>
<p class="calibre1">out,	and	until	more	moved	their	way,	they	were	safe	from	the	beasts.	For	the	first time	 in	 their	 lives,	 the	 Sansi	 could	 go	 outside	 at	 night	 and	 no	 longer	 fear	 the wrath	of	their	ancient	nemesis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 the	 help	 of	 Rahul	 and	 Cindy,	 the	 indigenous	 people	 were	 eventually convinced	 that	 the	 people	 they	 thought	 of	 as	 gods	 were	 not	 omnipotent.	 The Kuthra	 were	 as	 mortal	 as	 the	 Sansi.	 Nevertheless,	 the	 Sansi	 marveled	 at	 their new	 friend’s	 intelligence,	 kindness,	 and	 mysterious	 technology.	 Their</p>
<p class="calibre1">benefactors	 began	 teaching	 them	 and	 assisting	 with	 a	 limited	 number	 of improvements	to	their	lives.	One	of	the	first	miracles	they	received	was	a	steel knife	that	could	slice	and	cut	almost	without	resistance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Earthlings	could	not	dissuade	the	natives	of	Avalon	from	their	belief	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 ancient	 prophecy,	 foretold	 generations	 before,	 had	 come	 true.	 The	 Kuthra came	from	the	stars	to	save	them	from	the	Riktors.	This	fact	was	one	truth	they would	write	into	their	journals	for	future	generations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeds	 from	 the	 seed	 bank	 on	 board	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Excalibur</i>	 were	 brought	 down	 and planted,	and	crops	begun.	Frozen	embryos	of	farm	stock,	in	unique	hibernation</p>
<p class="calibre1">pods	of	their	own,	were	revived	and	eventually	raised	into	cows,	chickens,	pigs, and	 sheep.	 While	 they	 waited	 for	 the	 livestock	 to	 get	 old	 enough	 to	 be	 useful, they	hunted	the	local	game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	hunting	was	good,	and	the	captain	began	to	experiment	with	Avalonian</p>
<p class="calibre1">wild	game	in	an	attempt	to	replicate	a	good	old-fashioned	hamburger.	The	laser</p>
<p class="calibre1">rifles	made	it	almost	too	easy.	Still,	the	taste	of	a	traditional	burger	eluded	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a>The	winter	was	harsh	at	times.	The	settlers	expected	this	and	were	prepared, which	allowed	them	to	make	it	through	without	too	much	difficulty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doc	Cody	met	someone.	She	was	an	agricultural	engineer	that	proved	to	be	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lovely	 woman	 with	 many	 of	 the	 same	 interests	 as	 he.	 They	 could	 be	 seen walking	 the	 perimeter	 late	 at	 night	 holding	 hands.	 He	 was	 black,	 and	 she	 was white.	It	bothered	no	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	threw	a	birthday	party	for	Tammy	with	a	little	help	from	Chris	and	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">friends	that	left	her	in	tears.	When	Christmas	day	rolled	around,	they	gave	her	so many	 presents	 she	 needed	 two	 people	 to	 help	 carry	 them	 home.	 Chris	 said	 she cried	for	an	hour. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chris	and	Tammy	got	married.	It	was	a	foregone	conclusion	when	one	saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">how	 they	 looked	 at	 each	 other.	 Few	 were	 surprised	 when	 it	 was	 revealed	 they were	expecting	a	child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ana	 and	 Kayla	 were	 spending	 a	 lot	 of	 time	 together	 and	 were	 the	 best	 of friends.	Some	even	considered	them	a	couple.	Very	few	found	it	odd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doctor	Florida	laboriously	repaired	Robot	Nine,	and	even	equipped	him	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	enhancements.	He	 now	had	three	 legs—to	match	his	 three	arms—that	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 deploy	 for	 navigating	 soft	 ground.	 Although	 the	 little	 kamikaze	 was	 not quite	as	fast,	mud	was	no	longer	a	problem.	He	also	sported	a	painted	on	security uniform;	complete	with	a	deputy	badge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Elizabeth	 and	 Al	 moved	 in	 together,	 and	 although	 it	 was	 awkward	 at	 the beginning,	they	learned	quickly	to	allow	for	each	other’s	unique	needs.	It	was	a good	relationship,	and	they	were	both	quite	happy.	The	colony	had	accepted	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	what	he	was,	and	he	was	content. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 captain	 insisted	 on	 and	 organized	 a	 Thanksgiving	 celebration.	 Long tables	 were	 set	 up	 outside	 and	 covered	 with	 fruits	 and	 vegetables	 from	 the shipboard	farm	and	the	first	produce	of	the	first	harvest.	The	Sansi	brought	their favorites.	Fresh	filtered	water	was	available	within	arm’s	reach,	along	with	a	fair selection	of	wine	from	Earth	and	a	small	sampling	of	Avalonian	wine.	Everyone</p>
<p class="calibre1">attended,	and	all	had	a	good	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 the	 first	 time,	 the	 Sansi	 were	 able	 to	 enjoy	 a	 beautiful	 starlit	 evening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most	of	the	natives	had	never	had	the	opportunity	to	experience	or	appreciate	a night	life.	Lanterns	lit	the	outside	of	the	community	center	and	contributed	to	the atmosphere	 of	 celebration,	 while	 a	 small	 group	 of	 colonial	 musicians	 played softly	on	the	center	porch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During	the	party,	the	natives	were	introduced	to	many	kinds	of	Kuthra	foods, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	for	the	first	time—the	relaxing	effects	of	wine.	It	turned	out	to	be	a	hugely successful	party	and	went	much	better	than	anyone	could	have	hoped. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a>At	midnight,	the	humans	introduced	the	Sansi	to	the	age-old	human	tradition of	 <i class="calibre4">The	Toast</i>,	when	the	captain	initiated	a	mass	salute	where	everyone	took	part. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	a	single	group,	the	Sansi	and	Kuthra	clinked	and	raised	their	glasses,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">loudly	proclaimed—“To	Avalon!” </p>

<p class="calibre1">Standing	at	the	top	of	a	grass	covered	hill,	with	a	sweet	smelling	breeze	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 back,	 Al	 Clark	 reveled	 in	 the	 bright	 morning	 sunshine	 of	 a	 perfect spring	 day.	 Jagged	 heights	 filled	 the	 horizon	 as	 the	 sun	 hoisted	 itself	 up	 and kissed	the	mountain	tops. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	valley	below,	the	small	idyllic	village	of	Camelot	was	shaking	off	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">Someone	was	running	up	the	hill	towards	him	yelling	something—a	couple</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	words	over	and	over;	maybe	a	name,	maybe	a	warning?	He	cupped	his	ears</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 his	 hands	 to	 better	 hear	 what	 the	 person	 was	 saying,	 but	 the	 sounds	 came muffled	and	distorted;	carried	away	by	the	wind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 person	 got	 closer	 and	 closer,	 arms	 and	 legs	 pumping,	 and	 the	 words became	 clearer	 and	 clearer	 until	 there	 could	 be	 no	 mistake—It	 was	 Elizabeth, and	she	was	yelling,	“It’s	a	boy!	It’s	a	boy!	We	are	grandparents!”	It	was	official. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	the	proud	grandparents	of	the	first	human	child	born	on	Avalon. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The	 books	 he	 creates	 are	 a	 throwback	 to	 the	 cheap	 pulp	 paperbacks	 he bought	 as	 a	 teenager.	 Books	 that	 one	 could	 carry	 in	 a	 back	 pocket.	 They	 are adventures	 that	 portray	 nostalgia	 for	 the	 past,	 excitement	 for	 the	 present,	 and	 a fervent	hope	for	the	future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	book	is	the	first	in	the	AL	CLARK	series. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Also	available:</p>
<p class="calibre1">AL	CLARK-	Avalon	(Book	Two)</p>
<p class="calibre1">AL	CLARK-	Thera	(Book	Three)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Also	available:</p>
<p class="calibre1">VINCENT-	A	Starship	like	no	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	an	independent	author,	reviews	are	a	vital	component	for	success.	Good</p>
<p class="calibre1">reviews	 create	 more	 exposure,	 and	 recognition	 of	 an	 author’s	 efforts.	 Not-so-good	 reviews	 help	 him	 to	 perfect	 his	 craft.	 Please	 be	 kind	 and	 post	 a	 review wherever	you	purchased	this	book. </p>
