<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">OF	THE	LEGENDARY	PAST</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">"LITTLE	 WARS"	 is	 the	 game	 of	 kings—for	 players	 in	 an	 inferior	 social position.	It	can	be	played	by	boys	of	every	age	from	twelve	to	one	hundred	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">fifty—and	 even	 later	 if	 the	 limbs	 remain	 sufficiently	 supple—by	 girls	 of	 the better	sort,	and	by	a	few	rare	and	gifted	women.	This	is	to	be	a	full	History	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Little	Wars	from	its	recorded	and	authenticated	beginning	until	the	present	time, an	account	of	how	to	make	little	warfare,	and	hints	of	the	most	priceless	sort	for the	recumbent	strategist.... </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p6"></a>But	 first	 let	 it	 be	 noted	 in	 passing	 that	 there	 were	 prehistoric	 "Little	 Wars." </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	is	no	new	thing,	no	crude	novelty;	but	a	thing	tested	by	time,	ancient	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">ripe	 in	 its	 essentials	 for	 all	 its	 perennial	 freshness—like	 spring.	 There	 was	 a Someone	 who	 fought	 Little	 Wars	 in	 the	 days	 of	 Queen	 Anne;	 a	 garden</p>
<p class="calibre1">Napoleon.	 His	 game	 was	 inaccurately	 observed	 and	 insufficiently	 recorded	 by Laurence	 Sterne.	 It	 is	 clear	 that	 Uncle	 Toby	 and	 Corporal	 Trim	 were	 playing Little	Wars	on	a	scale	and	with	an	elaboration	exceeding	even	the	richness	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">beauty	of	the	contemporary	game.	But	the	curtain	is	drawn	back	only	to	tantalise</p>
<p class="calibre1">us.	 It	 is	 scarcely	 conceivable	 that	 anywhere	 now	 on	 earth	 the	 Shandean	 Rules remain	on	record.	Perhaps	they	were	never	committed	to	paper.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	in	all	ages	a	certain	barbaric	warfare	has	been	waged	with	soldiers	of	tin</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	lead	and	wood,	with	the	weapons	of	the	wild,	with	the	catapult,	the	elastic</p>
<p class="calibre1">circular	garter,	the	peashooter,	the	rubber	ball,	and	such-like	appliances—a	mere setting	 up	 and	 knocking	 down	 of	 men.	 Tin	 murder.	 The	 advance	 of	 civilisation has	 swept	 such	 rude	 contests	 altogether	 from	 the	 playroom.	 We	 know	 them	 no more.... </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">II</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE	BEGINNINGS	OF	MODERN	LITTLE	WARFARE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	 beginning	 of	 the	 game	 of	 Little	 War,	 as	 we	 know	 it,	 became	 possible with	the	invention	of	the	spring	breechloader	gun.	This	priceless	gift	to	boyhood appeared	somewhen	towards	the	end	of	the	last	century,	a	gun	capable	of	hitting</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	toy	soldier	nine	times	out	of	ten	at	a	distance	of	nine	yards.	It	has	completely superseded	 all	 the	 spiral-spring	 and	 other	 makes	 of	 gun	 hitherto	 used	 in playroom	 warfare.	 These	 spring	 breechloaders	 are	 made	 in	 various	 sizes	 and patterns,	 but	 the	 one	 used	 in	 our	 game	 is	 that	 known	 in	 England	 as	 the	 four-point-seven	gun.	It	fires	a	wooden	cylinder	about	an	inch	long,	and	has	a	screw</p>
<p class="calibre1">adjustment	for	elevation	and	depression.	It	is	an	altogether	elegant	weapon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	with	one	of	these	guns	that	the	beginning	of	our	war	game	was	made. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	at	Sandgate—in	England. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>Showing	a	country	prepared	for	the	war	game</p>
<p class="calibre1">Showing	countries	prepared	for	the	war	game</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	present	writer	had	been	lunching	with	a	friend—let	me	veil	his	identity</p>
<p class="calibre1">under	 the	 initials	 J.	 K.	 J.—in	 a	 room	 littered	 with	 the	 irrepressible	 debris	 of	 a small	 boy's	 pleasures.	 On	 a	 table	 near	 our	 own	 stood	 four	 or	 five	 soldiers	 and one	 of	 these	 guns.	 Mr	 J.	 K.	 J.,	 his	 more	 urgent	 needs	 satisfied	 and	 the	 coffee imminent,	drew	a	chair	to	this	little	table,	sat	down,	examined	the	gun	discreetly, loaded	it	warily,	aimed,	and	hit	his	man.	Thereupon	he	boasted	of	the	deed,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">issued	challenges	that	were	accepted	with	avidity.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 fired	 that	 day	 a	 shot	 that	 still	 echoes	 round	 the	 world.	 An	 affair—let	 us parallel	 the	 Cannonade	 of	 Valmy	 and	 call	 it	 the	 Cannonade	 of	 Sandgate—</p>
<p class="calibre1">occurred,	 a	 shooting	 between	 opposed	 ranks	 of	 soldiers,	 a	 shooting	 not	 very different	in	spirit—but	how	different	in	results!—from	the	prehistoric	warfare	of catapult	and	garter.	"But	suppose,"	said	his	antagonists;	"suppose	somehow	one could	move	the	men!"	and	therewith	opened	a	new	world	of	belligerence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	matter	went	no	further	with	Mr	J.	K.	J.	The	seed	lay	for	a	time	gathering</p>
<p class="calibre1">strength,	and	then	began	to	germinate	with	another	friend,	Mr	W.	To	Mr	W.	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">broached	 the	 idea:	 "I	 believe	 that	 if	 one	 set	 up	 a	 few	 obstacles	 on	 the	 floor, volumes	of	the	British	Encyclopedia	and	so	forth,	to	make	a	Country,	and	moved</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	 soldiers	 and	 guns	 about,	 one	 could	 have	 rather	 a	 good	 game,	 a	 kind	 of kriegspiel."... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Primitive	attempts	to	realise	the	dream	were	interrupted	by	a	great	rustle	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">chattering	 of	 lady	 visitors.	 They	 regarded	 the	 objects	 upon	 the	 floor	 with	 the empty	disdain	of	their	sex	for	all	imaginative	things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 the	 writer	 had	 in	 those	 days	 a	 very	 dear	 friend,	 a	 man	 too	 ill	 for	 long excursions	or	vigorous	sports	(he	has	been	dead	now	these	six	years),	of	a	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">sweet	companionable	disposition,	a	hearty	jester	and	full	of	the	spirit	of	play.	To him	the	idea	was	broached	more	fruitfully.	We	got	two	forces	of	toy	soldiers,	set out	 a	 lumpish	 Encyclopaedic	 land	 upon	 the	 carpet,	 and	 began	 to	 play.	 We arranged	to	move	in	alternate	moves:	first	one	moved	all	his	force	and	then	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">other;	an	infantry-man	could	move	one	foot	at	each	move,	a	cavalry-man	two,	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>gun	two,	and	it	might	fire	six	shots;	and	if	a	man	was	moved	up	to	touch	another man,	then	we	tossed	up	and	decided	which	man	was	dead.	So	we	made	a	game, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which	 was	 not	 a	 good	 game,	 but	 which	 was	 very	 amusing	 once	 or	 twice.	 The men	 were	 packed	 under	 the	 lee	 of	 fat	 volumes,	 while	 the	 guns,	 animated	 by	 a spirit	of	their	own,	banged	away	at	any	exposed	head,	or	prowled	about	in	search</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	a	shot.	Occasionally	men	came	into	contact,	with	remarkable	results.	Rash	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	man	who	trusts	his	life	to	the	spin	of	a	coin.	One	impossible	paladin	slew	in succession	nine	men	and	turned	defeat	to	victory,	to	the	extreme	exasperation	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	strategist	who	had	led	those	victims	to	their	doom.	This	inordinate	factor	of chance	 eliminated	 play;	 the	 individual	 freedom	 of	 guns	 turned	 battles	 into scandals	 of	 crouching	 concealment;	 there	 was	 too	 much	 cover	 afforded	 by	 the books	 and	 vast	 intervals	 of	 waiting	 while	 the	 players	 took	 aim.	 And	 yet	 there was	something	about	it....	It	was	a	game	crying	aloud	for	improvement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Improvement	 came	 almost	 simultaneously	 in	 several	 directions.	 First	 there was	 the	 development	 of	 the	 Country.	 The	 soldiers	 did	 not	 stand	 well	 on	 an ordinary	 carpet,	 the	 Encyclopedia	 made	 clumsy	 cliff-like	 "cover",	 and	 more particularly	 the	 room	 in	 which	 the	 game	 had	 its	 beginnings	 was	 subject	 to	 the invasion	 of	 callers,	 alien	 souls,	 trampling	 skirt-swishers,	 chatterers,	 creatures unfavourably	impressed	by	the	spectacle	of	two	middle-aged	men	playing	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">"toy	soldiers"	on	the	floor,	and	very	heated	and	excited	about	it.	Overhead	was the	day	nursery,	with	a	wide	extent	of	smooth	cork	carpet	(the	natural	terrain	of toy	soldiers),	a	large	box	of	bricks—such	as	I	have	described	in	Floor	Games—</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	certain	large	inch-thick	boards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	an	easy	task	for	the	head	of	the	household	to	evict	his	offspring,	annex</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	advantages,	and	set	about	planning	a	more	realistic	country.	(I	forget	what became	 of	 the	 children.)	 The	 thick	 boards	 were	 piled	 up	 one	 upon	 another	 to form	 hills;	 holes	 were	 bored	 in	 them,	 into	 which	 twigs	 of	 various	 shrubs	 were stuck	to	represent	trees;	houses	and	sheds	(solid	and	compact	piles	of	from	three to	six	or	seven	inches	high,	and	broad	in	proportion)	and	walls	were	made	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	bricks;	ponds	and	swamps	and	rivers,	with	fords	and	so	forth	indicated,	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">chalked	out	on	the	floor,	garden	stones	were	brought	in	to	represent	great	rocks, and	 the	 "Country"	 at	 least	 of	 our	 perfected	 war	 game	 was	 in	 existence.	 We discovered	 it	 was	 easy	 to	 cut	 out	 and	 bend	 and	 gum	 together	 paper	 and cardboard	 walls,	 into	 which	 our	 toy	 bricks	 could	 be	 packed,	 and	 on	 which	 we could	 paint	 doors	 and	 windows,	 creepers	 and	 rain-water	 pipes,	 and	 so	 forth,	 to represent	houses,	castles,	and	churches	in	a	more	realistic	manner,	and,	growing</p>
<p class="calibre1">skilful,	we	made	various	bridges	and	so	forth	of	card.	Every	boy	who	has	ever</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>put	 together	 model	 villages	 knows	 how	 to	 do	 these	 things,	 and	 the	 attentive reader	will	find	them	edifyingly	represented	in	our	photographic	illustrations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 has	 been	 little	 development	 since	 that	 time	 in	 the	 Country.	 Our</p>
<p class="calibre1">illustrations	 show	 the	 methods	 of	 arrangement,	 and	 the	 reader	 will	 see	 how easily	and	readily	the	utmost	variety	of	battlefields	can	be	made.	(It	is	merely	to be	remarked	that	a	too	crowded	Country	makes	the	guns	ineffective	and	leads	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	mere	tree	to	tree	and	house	to	house	scramble,	and	that	large	open	spaces	along the	 middle,	 or	 rivers	 without	 frequent	 fords	 and	 bridges,	 lead	 to	 ineffective cannonades,	 because	 of	 the	 danger	 of	 any	 advance.	 On	 the	 whole,	 too	 much cover	 is	 better	 than	 too	 little.)	 We	 decided	 that	 one	 player	 should	 plan	 and	 lay out	 the	 Country,	 and	 the	 other	 player	 choose	 from	 which	 side	 he	 would	 come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	to-day	we	 play	over	such	 landscapes	in	a	 cork-carpeted	schoolroom,	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	 the	 proper	 occupants	 are	 no	 longer	 evicted	 but	 remain	 to	 take	 an increasingly	 responsible	 and	 less	 and	 less	 audible	 and	 distressing	 share	 in	 the operations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Showing	the	war	game	in	the	open	air</p>
<p class="calibre1">The	war	game	in	the	open	air</p>
<p class="calibre1">We	found	it	necessary	to	make	certain	general	rules.	Houses	and	sheds	must</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 made	 of	 solid	 lumps	 of	 bricks,	 and	 not	 hollow	 so	 that	 soldiers	 can	 be	 put inside	 them,	 because	 otherwise	 muddled	 situations	 arise.	 And	 it	 was	 clearly necessary	to	provide	for	the	replacement	of	disturbed	objects	by	chalking	out	the outlines	of	boards	and	houses	upon	the	floor	or	boards	upon	which	they	stood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	while	we	thus	perfected	the	Country,	we	were	also	eliminating	all	sorts</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 tediums,	 disputable	 possibilities,	 and	 deadlocks	 from	 the	 game.	 We	 decided that	every	man	should	be	as	brave	and	skilful	as	every	other	man,	and	that	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">two	 men	 of	 opposite	 sides	 came	 into	 contact	 they	 would	 inevitably	 kill	 each other.	This	restored	strategy	to	its	predominance	over	chance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	then	began	to	humanise	that	wild	and	fearful	fowl,	the	gun.	We	decided</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 a	 gun	 could	 not	 be	 fired	 if	 there	 were	 not	 six—afterwards	 we	 reduced	 the number	to	four—men	within	six	inches	of	it.	And	we	ruled	that	a	gun	could	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">both	fire	and	move	in	the	same	general	move:	it	could	either	be	fired	or	moved</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>(or	left	alone).	If	there	were	less	than	six	men	within	six	inches	of	a	gun,	then	we tried	letting	it	fire	as	many	shots	as	there	were	men,	and	we	permitted	a	single</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	to	move	a	gun,	and	move	with	it	as	far	as	he	could	go	by	the	rules—a	foot, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 is,	 if	 he	 was	 an	 infantry-man,	 and	 two	 feet	 if	 he	 was	 a	 cavalry-man.	 We abolished	altogether	that	magical	freedom	of	an	unassisted	gun	to	move	two	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	on	such	rules	as	these	we	fought	a	number	of	battles.	They	were	interesting, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 not	 entirely	 satisfactory.	 We	 took	 no	 prisoners—a	 feature	 at	 once	 barbaric and	 unconvincing.	 The	 battles	 lingered	 on	 a	 long	 time,	 because	 we	 shot	 with extreme	care	and	deliberation,	and	they	were	hard	to	bring	to	a	decisive	finish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	guns	were	altogether	too	predominant.	They	prevented	attacks	getting	home, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 they	 made	 it	 possible	 for	 a	 timid	 player	 to	 put	 all	 his	 soldiers	 out	 of	 sight behind	hills	and	houses,	and	bang	away	if	his	opponent	showed	as	much	as	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tip	of	a	bayonet.	Monsieur	Bloch	seemed	vindicated,	and	Little	War	had	become</p>
<p class="calibre1">impossible.	 And	 there	 was	 something	 a	 little	 absurd,	 too,	 in	 the	 spectacle	 of	 a solitary	drummer-boy,	for	example,	marching	off	with	a	gun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 as	 there	 was	 nevertheless	 much	 that	 seemed	 to	 us	 extremely	 pretty	 and picturesque	about	the	game,	we	set	to	work—and	here	a	certain	Mr	M.	with	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">brother,	 Captain	 M.,	 hot	 from	 the	 Great	 War	 in	 South	 Africa,	 came	 in	 most helpfully—to	 quicken	 it.	 Manifestly	 the	 guns	 had	 to	 be	 reduced	 to	 manageable terms.	We	cut	down	the	number	of	shots	per	move	to	four,	and	we	required	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">four	men	should	be	within	six	inches	of	a	gun	for	it	to	be	in	action	at	all.	Without four	men	it	could	neither	fire	nor	move—it	was	out	of	action;	and	if	it	moved, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 four	 men	 had	 to	 go	 with	 it.	 Moreover,	 to	 put	 an	 end	 to	 that	 little	 resistant body	 of	 men	 behind	 a	 house,	 we	 required	 that	 after	 a	 gun	 had	 been	 fired	 it should	remain,	without	alteration	of	the	elevation,	pointing	in	the	direction	of	its last	shot,	and	have	two	men	placed	one	on	either	side	of	the	end	of	its	trail.	This secured	a	certain	exposure	on	the	part	of	concealed	and	sheltered	gunners.	It	was no	 longer	 possible	 to	 go	 on	 shooting	 out	 of	 a	 perfect	 security	 for	 ever.	 All	 this favoured	the	attack	and	led	to	a	livelier	game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	 next	 step	 was	 to	 abolish	 the	 tedium	 due	 to	 the	 elaborate	 aiming	 of	 the guns,	 by	 fixing	 a	 time	 limit	 for	 every	 move.	 We	 made	 this	 an	 outside	 limit	 at first,	 ten	 minutes,	 but	 afterwards	 we	 discovered	 that	 it	 made	 the	 game	 much more	warlike	to	cut	the	time	down	to	a	length	that	would	barely	permit	a	slow-moving	player	to	fire	all	his	guns	and	move	all	his	men.	This	led	to	small	bodies of	 men	 lagging	 and	 "getting	 left,"	 to	 careless	 exposures,	 to	 rapid,	 less	 accurate shooting,	and	just	that	eventfulness	one	would	expect	in	the	hurry	and	passion	of real	 fighting.	 It	 also	 made	 the	 game	 brisker.	 We	 have	 since	 also	 made	 a	 limit, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>sometimes	 of	 four	 minutes,	 sometimes	 of	 five	 minutes,	 to	 the	 interval	 for adjustment	and	deliberation	after	one	move	is	finished	and	before	the	next	move</p>
<p class="calibre1">begins.	 This	 further	 removes	 the	 game	 from	 the	 chess	 category,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">approximates	 it	 to	 the	 likeness	 of	 active	 service.	 Most	 of	 a	 general's	 decisions, once	 a	 fight	 has	 begun,	 must	 be	 made	 in	 such	 brief	 intervals	 of	 time.	 (But	 we leave	unlimited	time	at	the	outset	for	the	planning.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">As	to	our	time-keeping,	we	catch	a	visitor	with	a	stop-watch	if	we	can,	and	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	cannot,	we	use	a	fair-sized	clock	with	a	second-hand:	the	player	not	moving</p>
<p class="calibre1">says	"Go,"	and	warns	at	the	last	two	minutes,	last	minute,	and	last	thirty	seconds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 I	 think	 it	 would	 not	 be	 difficult	 to	 procure	 a	 cheap	 clock—because,	 of course,	no	one	wants	a	very	accurate	agreement	with	Greenwich	as	to	the	length</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 a	 second—that	 would	 have	 minutes	 instead	 of	 hours	 and	 seconds	 instead	 of minutes,	and	that	would	ping	at	the	end	of	every	minute	and	discharge	an	alarm</p>
<p class="calibre1">note	at	the	end	of	the	move.	That	would	abolish	the	rather	boring	strain	of	time-</p>
<p class="calibre1">keeping.	One	could	just	watch	the	fighting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,	 in	 our	 desire	 to	 bring	 the	 game	 to	 a	 climax,	 we	 decided	 that instead	 of	 a	 fight	 to	 a	 finish	 we	 would	 fight	 to	 some	 determined	 point,	 and	 we found	 very	 good	 sport	 in	 supposing	 that	 the	 arrival	 of	 three	 men	 of	 one	 force upon	 the	 back	 line	 of	 the	 opponent's	 side	 of	 the	 country	 was	 of	 such	 strategic importance	 as	 to	 determine	 the	 battle.	 But	 this	 form	 of	 battle	 we	 have	 since largely	abandoned	in	favour	of	the	old	fight	to	a	finish	again.	We	found	it	led	to one	 type	 of	 battle	 only,	 a	 massed	 rush	 at	 the	 antagonist's	 line,	 and	 that	 our arrangements	of	time-limits	and	capture	and	so	forth	had	eliminated	most	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">concluding	drag	upon	the	game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	game	was	now	very	much	in	its	present	form.	We	considered	at	various</p>
<p class="calibre1">times	the	possibility	of	introducing	some	complication	due	to	the	bringing	up	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">ammunition	or	supplies	generally,	and	we	decided	that	it	would	add	little	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">interest	or	reality	of	the	game.	Our	battles	are	little	brisk	fights	in	which	one	may suppose	 that	 all	 the	 ammunition	 and	 food	 needed	 are	 carried	 by	 the	 men themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	our	latest	development	has	been	in	the	direction	of	killing	hand	to	hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 taking	 prisoners.	 We	 found	 it	 necessary	 to	 distinguish	 between	 an	 isolated force	and	a	force	that	was	merely	a	projecting	part	of	a	larger	force.	We	made	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">definition	 of	 isolation.	 After	 a	 considerable	 amount	 of	 trials	 we	 decided	 that	 a man	 or	 a	 detachment	 shall	 be	 considered	 to	 be	 isolated	 when	 there	 is	 less	 than</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>half	 its	 number	 of	 its	 own	 side	 within	 a	 move	 of	 it.	 Now,	 in	 actual	 civilised warfare	small	detached	bodies	do	not	sell	their	lives	dearly;	a	considerably	larger force	is	able	to	make	them	prisoners	without	difficulty.	Accordingly	we	decided</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	if	a	blue	force,	for	example,	has	one	or	more	men	isolated,	and	a	red	force	of at	least	double	the	strength	of	this	isolated	detachment	moves	up	to	contact	with it,	the	blue	men	will	be	considered	to	be	prisoners. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 seemed	 fair;	 but	 so	 desperate	 is	 the	 courage	 and	 devotion	 of	 lead soldiers,	that	it	came	to	this,	that	any	small	force	that	got	or	seemed	likely	to	get isolated	and	caught	by	a	superior	force	instead	of	waiting	to	be	taken	prisoners, dashed	 at	 its	 possible	 captors	 and	 slew	 them	 man	 for	 man.	 It	 was	 manifestly unreasonable	 to	 permit	 this.	 And	 in	 considering	 how	 best	 to	 prevent	 such inhuman	heroisms,	we	were	reminded	of	another	frequent	incident	in	our	battles</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 also	 erred	 towards	 the	 incredible	 and	 vitiated	 our	 strategy.	 That	 was	 the charging	of	one	or	two	isolated	horse-men	at	a	gun	in	order	to	disable	it.	Let	me illustrate	this	by	an	incident.	A	force	consisting	of	ten	infantry	and	five	cavalry with	 a	 gun	 are	 retreating	 across	 an	 exposed	 space,	 and	 a	 gun	 with	 thirty	 men, cavalry	 and	 infantry,	 in	 support	 comes	 out	 upon	 a	 crest	 into	 a	 position	 to	 fire within	 two	 feet	 of	 the	 retreating	 cavalry.	 The	 attacking	 player	 puts	 eight	 men within	six	inches	of	his	gun	and	pushes	the	rest	of	his	men	a	little	forward	to	the right	 or	 left	 in	 pursuit	 of	 his	 enemy.	 In	 the	 real	 thing,	 the	 retreating	 horsemen would	go	off	to	cover	with	the	gun,	"hell	for	leather,"	while	the	infantry	would open	 out	 and	 retreat,	 firing.	 But	 see	 what	 happened	 in	 our	 imperfect	 form	 of Little	 War!	 The	 move	 of	 the	 retreating	 player	 began.	 Instead	 of	 retreating	 his whole	force,	he	charged	home	with	his	mounted	desperadoes,	killed	five	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">eight	men	about	the	gun,	and	so	by	the	rule	silenced	it,	enabling	the	rest	of	his little	body	to	get	clean	away	to	cover	at	the	leisurely	pace	of	one	foot	a	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	not	like	any	sort	of	warfare.	In	real	life	cavalry	cannot	pick	out	and	kill its	 equivalent	 in	 cavalry	 while	 that	 equivalent	 is	 closely	 supported	 by	 other cavalry	or	infantry;	a	handful	of	troopers	cannot	gallop	past	well	and	abundantly manned	guns	in	action,	cut	down	the	gunners	and	interrupt	the	fire.	And	yet	for	a time	 we	 found	 it	 a	 little	 difficult	 to	 frame	 simple	 rules	 to	 meet	 these	 two	 bad cases	and	prevent	such	scandalous	possibilities.	We	did	at	last	contrive	to	do	so; we	invented	what	we	call	the	melee,	and	our	revised	rules	in	the	event	of	a	melee will	be	found	set	out	upon	a	later	page.	They	do	really	permit	something	like	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">actual	result	to	hand-to-hand	encounters.	They	abolish	Horatius	Cocles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	war	game	in	the	open	air</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>Fig.	1--Battle	of	Hook's	Farm.	General	View	of	the	Battlefield	and	Red	Army We	also	found	difficulties	about	the	capturing	of	guns.	At	first	we	had	merely</p>
<p class="calibre1">provided	that	a	gun	was	captured	when	it	was	out	of	action	and	four	men	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">opposite	force	were	within	six	inches	of	it,	but	we	found	a	number	of	cases	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	 this	 rule	 was	 too	 vague.	 A	 gun,	 for	 example,	 would	 be	 disabled	 and	 left with	only	three	men	within	six	inches;	the	enemy	would	then	come	up	eight	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">ten	strong	within	six	inches	on	the	other	side,	but	not	really	reaching	the	gun.	At the	next	move	the	original	possessor	of	the	gun	would	bring	up	half	a	dozen	men</p>
<p class="calibre1">within	six	inches.	To	whom	did	the	gun	belong?	By	the	original	wording	of	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">rule,	it	might	be	supposed	to	belong	to	the	attack	which	had	never	really	touched the	gun	yet,	and	they	could	claim	to	turn	it	upon	its	original	side.	We	had	to	meet a	number	of	such	cases.	We	met	them	by	requiring	the	capturing	force—or,	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">precise,	 four	 men	 of	 it—actually	 to	 pass	 the	 axle	 of	 the	 gun	 before	 it	 could	 be taken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	sorts	of	odd	little	difficulties	arose	too,	connected	with	the	use	of	the	guns as	 a	 shelter	 from	 fire,	 and	 very	 exact	 rules	 had	 to	 be	 made	 to	 avoid	 tilting	 the nose	and	raising	the	breech	of	a	gun	in	order	to	use	it	as	cover.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 still	 found	 it	 difficult	 to	 introduce	 any	 imitation	 into	 our	 game	 of	 either retreat	 or	 the	 surrender	 of	 men	 not	 actually	 taken	 prisoners	 in	 a	 melee.	 Both things	 were	 possible	 by	 the	 rules,	 but	 nobody	 did	 them	 because	 there	 was	 no inducement	 to	 do	 them.	 Games	 were	 apt	 to	 end	 obstinately	 with	 the	 death	 or capture	 of	 the	 last	 man.	 An	 inducement	 was	 needed.	 This	 we	 contrived	 by playing	 not	 for	 the	 game	 but	 for	 points,	 scoring	 the	 result	 of	 each	 game	 and counting	 the	 points	 towards	 the	 decision	 of	 a	 campaign.	 Our	 campaign	 was	 to our	single	game	what	a	rubber	is	to	a	game	of	whist.	We	made	the	end	of	a	war</p>
<p class="calibre1">200,	 300,	 or	 400	 or	 more	 points	 up,	 according	 to	 the	 number	 of	 games	 we wanted	to	play,	and	we	scored	a	hundred	for	each	battle	won,	and	in	addition	1</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	each	infantry-man,	1-1/2	for	each	cavalry-man,	10	for	each	gun,	1/2	for	each</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	held	prisoner	by	the	enemy,	and	1/2	for	each	prisoner	held	at	the	end	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">game,	subtracting	what	the	antagonist	scored	by	the	same	scale.	Thus,	when	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt	the	battle	was	hopelessly	lost,	he	had	a	direct	inducement	to	retreat	any	guns he	could	still	save	and	surrender	any	men	who	were	under	the	fire	of	the	victors' </p>
<p class="calibre1">guns	 and	 likely	 to	 be	 slaughtered,	 in	 order	 to	 minimise	 the	 score	 against	 him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>And	an	interest	was	given	to	a	skilful	retreat,	in	which	the	loser	not	only	saved points	for	himself	but	inflicted	losses	upon	the	pursuing	enemy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	first	we	played	the	game	from	the	outset,	with	each	player's	force	within</p>
<p class="calibre1">sight	 of	 his	 antagonist;	 then	 we	 found	 it	 possible	 to	 hang	 a	 double	 curtain	 of casement	 cloth	 from	 a	 string	 stretched	 across	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 field,	 and	 we drew	this	back	only	after	both	sides	had	set	out	their	men.	Without	these	curtains we	found	the	first	player	was	at	a	heavy	disadvantage,	because	he	displayed	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	dispositions	before	his	opponent	set	down	his	men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	at	last	our	rules	have	reached	stability,	and	we	regard	them	now	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">virtuous	 pride	 of	 men	 who	 have	 persisted	 in	 a	 great	 undertaking	 and	 arrived	 at precision	after	much	tribulation.	There	is	not	a	piece	of	constructive	legislation in	 the	 world,	 not	 a	 solitary	 attempt	 to	 meet	 a	 complicated	 problem,	 that	 we	 do not	now	regard	the	more	charitably	for	our	efforts	to	get	a	right	result	from	this apparently	easy	and	puerile	business	of	fighting	with	tin	soldiers	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	so	our	laws	all	made,	battles	have	been	fought,	the	mere	beginnings,	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">feel,	of	vast	campaigns.	The	game	has	become	in	a	dozen	aspects	extraordinarily</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	 a	 small	 real	 battle.	 The	 plans	 are	 made,	 the	 Country	 hastily	 surveyed,	 and then	the	curtains	are	closed,	and	the	antagonists	make	their	opening	dispositions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 the	 curtains	 are	 drawn	 back	 and	 the	 hostile	 forces	 come	 within	 sight	 of each	other;	the	 little	companies	and	 squadrons	and	batteries	 appear	hurrying	to their	positions,	the	infantry	deploying	into	long	open	lines,	the	cavalry	sheltering in	reserve,	or	galloping	with	the	guns	to	favourable	advance	positions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 two	 or	 three	 moves	 the	 guns	 are	 flickering	 into	 action,	 a	 cavalry	 melee may	 be	 in	 progress,	 the	 plans	 of	 the	 attack	 are	 more	 or	 less	 apparent,	 here	 are men	pouring	out	from	the	shelter	of	a	wood	to	secure	some	point	of	vantage,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">here	are	troops	massing	among	farm	buildings	for	a	vigorous	attack.	The	combat</p>
<p class="calibre1">grows	hot	round	some	vital	point.	Move	follows	move	in	swift	succession.	One</p>
<p class="calibre1">realises	with	a	sickening	sense	of	error	that	one	is	outnumbered	and	hard	pressed here	 and	 uselessly	 cut	 off	 there,	 that	 one's	 guns	 are	 ill-placed,	 that	 one's	 wings are	 spread	 too	 widely,	 and	 that	 help	 can	 come	 only	 over	 some	 deadly	 zone	 of fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	the	fight	wears	on.	Guns	are	lost	or	won,	hills	or	villages	stormed	or	held; </p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly	it	grows	clear	that	the	scales	are	tilting	beyond	recovery,	and	the	loser has	nothing	left	but	to	contrive	how	he	may	get	to	the	back	line	and	safety	with</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>the	vestiges	of	his	command.... </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	let	me,	before	I	go	on	to	tell	of	actual	battles	and	campaigns,	give	here	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">summary	of	our	essential	rules. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">III</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE	RULES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">HERE,	 then,	 are	 the	 rules	 of	 the	 perfect	 battle-game	 as	 we	 play	 it	 in	 an ordinary	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE	COUNTRY</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">(1)	The	Country	must	be	arranged	by	one	player,	who,	failing	any	other	agreement,	shall	be	selected	by the	toss	of	a	coin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(2)	The	other	player	shall	then	choose	which	side	of	the	field	he	will	fight	from. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(3)	The	Country	must	be	disturbed	as	little	as	possible	in	each	move.	Nothing	in	the	Country	shall	be moved	 or	 set	 aside	 deliberately	 to	 facilitate	 the	 firing	 of	 guns.	 A	 player	 must	 not	 lie	 across	 the Country	 so	 as	 to	 crush	 or	 disturb	 the	 Country	 if	 his	 opponent	 objects.	 Whatever	 is	 moved	 by accident	shall	be	replaced	after	the	end	of	the	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">THE	MOVE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">(1)	After	the	Country	is	made	and	the	sides	chosen,	then	(and	not	until	then)	the	players	shall	toss	for the	first	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(2)	If	there	is	no	curtain,	the	player	winning	the	toss,	hereafter	called	the	First	Player,	shall	next	arrange his	men	along	his	back	line,	as	he	chooses.	Any	men	he	may	place	behind	or	in	front	of	his	back line	 shall	 count	 in	 the	 subsequent	 move	 as	 if	 they	 touched	 the	 back	 line	 at	 its	 nearest	 point.	 The Second	Player	shall	then	do	the	same.	But	if	a	curtain	is	available	both	first	and	second	player	may put	down	their	men	at	the	same	time.	Both	players	may	take	unlimited	time	for	the	putting	down	of their	men;	if	there	is	a	curtain	it	is	drawn	back	when	they	are	ready,	and	the	game	then	begins. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>Fig.	2--Battle	of	Hook's	Farm.	A	Near	View	of	the	Blue	Army</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fig.	3--Battle	of	Hook's	Farm.	Position	of	both	Armies	after	first	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(3)	The	subsequent	moves	after	the	putting	down	are	timed.	The	length	of	time	given	for	each	move	is determined	 by	 the	 size	 of	 the	 forces	 engaged.	 About	 a	 minute	 should	 be	 allowed	 for	 moving	 30</p>
<p class="calibre1">men	 and	 a	 minute	 for	 each	 gun.	 Thus	 for	 a	 force	 of	 110	 men	 and	 3	 guns,	 moved	 by	 one	 player, seven	 minutes	 is	 an	 ample	 allowance.	 As	 the	 battle	 progresses	 and	 the	 men	 are	 killed	 off,	 the allowance	is	reduced	as	the	players	may	agree.	The	player	about	to	move	stands	at	attention	a	yard behind	his	back	line	until	the	timekeeper	says	"Go."	He	then	proceeds	to	make	his	move	until	time is	up.	He	must	instantly	stop	at	the	cry	of	"Time."	Warning	should	be	given	by	the	timekeeper	two minutes,	one	minute,	and	thirty	seconds	before	time	is	up.	There	will	be	an	interval	before	the	next move,	 during	 which	 any	 disturbance	 of	 the	 Country	 can	 be	 rearranged	 and	 men	 accidentally overturned	replaced	in	a	proper	attitude.	This	interval	must	not	exceed	five	or	four	minutes,	as	may be	agreed	upon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(4)	Guns	must	not	be	fired	before	the	second	move	of	the	first	player—not	counting	the	"putting	down" </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	a	move.	Thus	the	first	player	puts	down,	then	the	second	player,	the	first	player	moves,	then	the second	player,	and	the	two	forces	are	then	supposed	to	come	into	effective	range	of	each	other	and the	first	player	may	open	fire	if	he	wishes	to	do	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(5)	 In	 making	 his	 move	 a	 player	 must	 move	 or	 fire	 his	 guns	 if	 he	 wants	 to	 do	 so,	 before	 moving	 his men.	To	this	rule	of	"Guns	First"	there	is	to	be	no	exception. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(6)	Every	soldier	may	be	moved	and	every	gun	moved	or	fired	at	each	move,	subject	to	the	following rules:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">MOBILITY	OF	THE	VARIOUS	ARMS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">(Each	 player	 must	 be	 provided	 with	 two	 pieces	 of	 string,	 one	 two	 feet	 in length	and	the	other	six	inches.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">(I)	An	infantry-man	may	be	moved	a	foot	or	any	less	distance	at	each	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(II)	A	cavalry-man	may	be	moved	two	feet	or	any	less	distance	at	each	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(III)	A	gun	is	in	action	if	there	are	at	least	four	men	of	its	own	side	within	six	inches	of	it.	If	there	are not	at	least	four	men	within	that	distance,	it	can	neither	be	moved	nor	fired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(IV)	If	a	gun	is	in	action	it	can	either	be	moved	or	fired	at	each	move,	but	not	both.	If	it	is	fired,	it	may fire	as	many	as	four	shots	in	each	move.	It	may	be	swung	round	on	its	axis	(the	middle	point	of	its wheel	 axle)	 to	 take	 aim,	 provided	 the	 Country	 about	 it	 permits;	 it	 may	 be	 elevated	 or	 depressed, and	the	soldiers	about	it	may,	at	the	discretion	of	the	firer,	be	made	to	lie	down	in	their	places	to facilitate	its	handling.	Moreover,	soldiers	who	have	got	in	front	of	the	fire	of	their	own	guns	may</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>lie	 down	 while	 the	 guns	 fire	 over	 them.	 At	 the	 end	 of	 the	 move	 the	 gun	 must	 be	 left	 without altering	its	elevation	and	pointing	in	the	direction	of	the	last	shot.	And	after	firing,	two	men	must be	placed	exactly	at	the	end	of	the	trail	of	the	gun,	one	on	either	side	in	a	line	directly	behind	the wheels.	So	much	for	firing.	If	the	gun	is	moved	and	not	fired,	then	at	least	four	men	who	are	with the	gun	must	move	up	with	it	to	its	new	position,	and	be	placed	within	six	inches	of	it	in	its	new position.	The	gun	itself	must	be	placed	trail	forward	and	the	muzzle	pointing	back	in	the	direction from	which	it	came,	and	so	it	must	remain	until	it	is	swung	round	on	its	axis	to	fire.	Obviously	the distance	which	a	gun	can	move	will	be	determined	by	the	men	it	is	with;	if	there	are	at	least	four cavalry-men	with	it,	they	can	take	the	gun	two	feet,	but	if	there	are	fewer	cavalry-men	than	four and	the	rest	infantry,	or	no	cavalry	and	all	infantry,	the	gun	will	be	movable	only	one	foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(V)	Every	man	must	be	placed	fairly	clear	of	hills,	buildings,	trees,	guns,	etc.	He	must	not	be	jammed into	interstices,	and	either	player	may	insist	upon	a	clear	distance	between	any	man	and	any	gun	or other	object	of	at	least	one-sixteenth	of	an	inch.	Nor	must	men	be	packed	in	contact	with	men.	A space	of	one-sixteenth	of	an	inch	should	be	kept	between	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(VI)	When	men	are	knocked	over	by	a	shot	they	are	dead,	and	as	many	men	are	dead	as	a	shot	knocks over	or	causes	to	fall	or	to	lean	so	that	they	would	fall	if	unsupported.	But	if	a	shot	strikes	a	man but	does	not	knock	him	over,	he	is	dead,	provided	the	shot	has	not	already	killed	a	man.	But	a	shot cannot	 kill	 more	 than	 one	 man	 without	 knocking	 him	 over,	 and	 if	 it	 touches	 several	 without oversetting	 them,	 only	 the	 first	 touched	 is	 dead	 and	 the	 others	 are	 not	 incapacitated.	 A	 shot	 that rebounds	from	or	glances	off	any	object	and	touches	a	man,	kills	him;	it	kills	him	even	if	it	simply rolls	to	his	feet,	subject	to	what	has	been	said	in	the	previous	sentence. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">HAND-TO-HAND	FIGHTING	AND	CAPTURING</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">(1)	A	man	or	a	body	of	men	which	has	less	than	half	its	own	number	of	men	on	its	own	side	within	a move	 of	 it,	 is	 said	 to	 be	 isolated.	 But	 if	 there	 is	 at	 least	 half	 its	 number	 of	 men	 of	 its	 own	 side within	a	move	of	it,	it	is	not	isolated;	it	is	supported. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(2)	 Men	 may	 be	 moved	 up	 into	 virtual	 contact	 (one-eighth	 of	 an	 inch	 or	 closer)	 with	 men	 of	 the opposite	side.	They	must	then	be	left	until	the	end	of	the	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(3)	At	the	end	of	the	move,	if	there	are	men	of	the	side	that	has	just	moved	in	contact	with	any	men	of the	other	side,	they	constitute	a	melee.	All	the	men	in	contact,	and	any	other	men	within	six	inches of	the	men	in	contact,	measuring	from	any	point	of	their	persons,	weapons,	or	horses,	are	supposed to	take	part	in	the	melee.	At	the	end	of	the	move	the	two	players	examine	the	melee	and	dispose	of the	men	concerned	according	to	the	following	rules:—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Either	the	numbers	taking	part	in	the	melee	on	each	side	are	equal	or	unequal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(a)	If	they	are	equal,	all	the	men	on	both	sides	are	killed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(b)	 If	 they	 are	 unequal,	 then	 the	 inferior	 force	 is	 either	 isolated	 or	 (measuring	 from	 the	 points	 of contact)	not	isolated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(i)	If	it	is	isolated	(see	(1)	above),	then	as	many	men	become	prisoners	as	the	inferior	force	is	less	in numbers	 than	 the	 superior	 force,	 and	 the	 rest	 kill	 each	 a	 man	 and	 are	 killed.	 Thus	 nine	 against</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>eleven	 have	 two	 taken	 prisoners,	 and	 each	 side	 seven	 men	 dead.	 Four	 of	 the	 eleven	 remain	 with two	prisoners.	One	may	put	this	in	another	way	by	saying	that	the	two	forces	kill	each	other	off, man	for	man,	until	one	force	is	double	the	other,	which	is	then	taken	prisoner.	Seven	men	kill	seven men,	and	then	four	are	left	with	two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(ii)	But	if	the	inferior	force	is	not	isolated	(see	(1)	above),	then	each	man	of	the	inferior	force	kills	a man	of	the	superior	force	and	is	himself	killed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	the	player	who	has	just	completed	the	move,	the	one	who	has	charged, </p>
<p class="calibre1">decides,	when	there	is	any	choice,	which	men	in	the	melee,	both	of	his	own	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	his	antagonist,	shall	die	and	which	shall	be	prisoners	or	captors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 these	 arrangements	 are	 made	 after	 the	 move	 is	 over,	 in	 the	 interval between	the	moves,	and	the	time	taken	for	the	adjustment	does	not	count	as	part</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	usual	interval	for	consideration.	It	is	extra	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	player	next	moving	may,	if	he	has	taken	prisoners,	move	these	prisoners. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prisoners	may	be	sent	under	escort	to	the	rear	or	wherever	the	capturer	directs, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	one	man	within	six	inches	of	any	number	of	prisoners	up	to	seven	can	escort</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	 prisoners	 and	 go	 with	 them.	 Prisoners	 are	 liberated	 by	 the	 death	 of	 any escort	there	may	be	within	six	inches	of	them,	but	they	may	not	be	moved	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">player	 of	 their	 own	 side	 until	 the	 move	 following	 that	 in	 which	 the	 escort	 is killed.	Directly	prisoners	are	taken	they	are	supposed	to	be	disarmed,	and	if	they are	liberated	they	cannot	fight	until	they	are	rearmed.	In	order	to	be	rearmed	they must	 return	 to	 the	 back	 line	 of	 their	 own	 side.	 An	 escort	 having	 conducted prisoners	to	the	back	line,	and	so	beyond	the	reach	of	liberation,	may	then	return into	the	fighting	line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prisoners	once	made	cannot	fight	until	they	have	returned	to	their	back	line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	follows,	therefore,	that	if	after	the	adjudication	of	a	melee	a	player	moves	up more	men	into	touch	with	the	survivors	of	this	first	melee,	and	so	constitutes	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">second	melee,	any	prisoners	made	in	the	first	melee	will	not	count	as	combatants</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	second	melee.	Thus	if	A	moves	up	nineteen	men	into	a	melee	with	thirteen</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	B's—B	having	only	five	in	support—A	makes	six	prisoners,	kills	seven	men, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	has	seven	of	his	own	killed.	If,	now,	B	can	move	up	fourteen	men	into	melee</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 A's	 victorious	 survivors,	 which	 he	 may	 be	 able	 to	 do	 by	 bringing	 the	 five into	contact,	and	getting	nine	others	within	six	inches	of	them,	no	count	is	made of	the	six	of	B's	men	who	are	prisoners	in	the	hands	of	A.	They	are	disarmed.	B, </p>
<p class="calibre1">therefore,	 has	 fourteen	 men	 in	 the	 second	 melee	 and	 A	 twelve,	 B	 makes	 two prisoners,	 kills	 ten	 of	 A's	 men,	 and	 has	 ten	 of	 his	 own	 killed.	 But	 now	 the	 six prisoners	 originally	 made	 by	 A	 are	 left	 without	 an	 escort,	 and	 are	 therefore</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>recaptured	 by	 B.	 But	 they	 must	 go	 to	 B's	 back	 line	 and	 return	 before	 they	 can fight	 again.	 So,	 as	 the	 outcome	 of	 these	 two	 melees,	 there	 are	 six	 of	 B's	 men going	 as	 released	 prisoners	 to	 his	 back	 line	 whence	 they	 may	 return	 into	 the battle,	two	of	A's	men	prisoners	in	the	hands	of	B,	one	of	B's	staying	with	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 escort,	 and	 three	 of	 B's	 men	 still	 actively	 free	 for	 action.	 A,	 at	 a	 cost	 of nineteen	 men,	 has	 disposed	 of	 seventeen	 of	 B's	 men	 for	 good,	 and	 of	 six	 or seven,	 according	 to	 whether	 B	 keeps	 his	 prisoners	 in	 his	 fighting	 line	 or	 not, temporarily. </p>

<p class="calibre1">(4)	Any	isolated	body	may	hoist	the	white	flag	and	surrender	at	any	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(5)	 A	 gun	 is	 captured	 when	 there	 is	 no	 man	 whatever	 of	 its	 original	 side	 within	 six	 inches	 of	 it,	 and when	at	least	four	men	of	the	antagonist	side	have	moved	up	to	it	and	have	passed	its	wheel	axis going	in	the	direction	of	their	attack.	This	latter	point	is	important.	An	antagonist's	gun	may	be	out of	action,	and	you	may	have	a	score	of	men	coming	up	to	it	and	within	six	inches	of	it,	but	it	is	not yet	captured;	and	you	may	have	brought	up	a	dozen	men	all	round	the	hostile	gun,	but	if	there	is still	one	enemy	just	out	of	their	reach	and	within	six	inches	of	the	end	of	the	trail	of	the	gun,	that gun	is	not	captured:	it	is	still	in	dispute	and	out	of	action,	and	you	may	not	fire	it	or	move	it	at	the next	move.	But	once	a	gun	is	fully	captured,	it	follows	all	the	rules	of	your	own	guns. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">VARIETIES	OF	THE	BATTLE-GAME</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">You	may	play	various	types	of	game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(1)	One	is	the	Fight	to	the	Finish.	You	move	in	from	any	points	you	like	on	the	back	line	and	try	to	kill, capture,	or	drive	over	his	back	line	the	whole	of	the	enemy's	force.	You	play	the	game	for	points; you	score	100	for	the	victory,	and	10	for	every	gun	you	hold	or	are	in	a	position	to	take,	1-1/2	for every	cavalry-man,	1	for	every	infantry-man	still	alive	and	uncaptured,	1/2	for	every	man	of	yours prisoner	in	the	hands	of	the	enemy,	and	1/2	for	every	prisoner	you	have	taken.	If	the	battle	is	still undecided	when	both	forces	are	reduced	below	fifteen	men,	the	battle	is	drawn	and	the	100	points for	victory	are	divided. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Note—This	game	can	be	fought	with	any	sized	force,	but	if	it	is	fought	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">less	than	50	a	side,	the	minimum	must	be	10	a	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>(2)	The	Blow	at	the	Rear	game	is	decided	when	at	least	three	men	of	one	force	reach	any	point	in	the back	line	of	their	antagonist.	He	is	then	supposed	to	have	suffered	a	strategic	defeat,	and	he	must retreat	his	entire	force	over	the	back	line	in	six	moves,	i.e.	six	of	his	moves.	Anything	left	on	the field	after	six	moves	capitulates	to	the	victor.	Points	count	as	in	the	preceding	game,	but	this	lasts	a shorter	time	and	is	better	adapted	to	a	cramped	country	with	a	short	back	line.	With	a	long	rear	line the	game	is	simply	a	rush	at	some	weak	point	in	the	first	player's	line	by	the	entire	cavalry	brigade of	the	second	player.	Instead	of	making	the	whole	back	line	available	for	the	Blow	at	the	Rear,	the middle	or	either	half	may	be	taken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(3)	In	the	Defensive	Game,	a	force,	the	defenders,	two-thirds	as	strong	as	its	antagonist,	tries	to	prevent the	latter	arriving,	while	still	a	quarter	of	its	original	strength,	upon	the	defender's	back	line.	The Country	 must	 be	 made	 by	 one	 or	 both	 of	 the	 players	 before	 it	 is	 determined	 which	 shall	 be defender.	 The	 players	 then	 toss	 for	 choice	 of	 sides,	 and	 the	 winner	 of	 the	 toss	 becomes	 the defender.	He	puts	out	his	force	over	the	field	on	his	own	side,	anywhere	up	to	the	distance	of	one move	off	the	middle	line—that	is	to	say,	he	must	not	put	any	man	within	one	move	of	the	middle line,	 but	 he	 may	 do	 so	 anywhere	 on	 his	 own	 side	 of	 that	 limit—and	 then	 the	 loser	 of	 the	 toss becomes	first	player,	and	sets	out	his	men	a	move	from	his	back	line.	The	defender	may	open	fire forthwith;	he	need	not	wait	until	after	the	second	move	of	the	first	player,	as	the	second	player	has to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">COMPOSITION	OF	FORCES</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Except	 in	 the	 above	 cases,	 or	 when	 otherwise	 agreed	 upon,	 the	 forces</p>
<p class="calibre1">engaged	 shall	 be	 equal	 in	 number	 and	 similar	 in	 composition.	 The	 methods	 of handicapping	are	obvious.	A	slight	inequality	(chances	of	war)	may	be	arranged</p>
<p class="calibre1">between	 equal	 players	 by	 leaving	 out	 12	 men	 on	 each	 side	 and	 tossing	 with	 a pair	 of	 dice	 to	 see	 how	 many	 each	 player	 shall	 take	 of	 these.	 The	 best arrangement	 and	 proportion	 of	 the	 forces	 is	 in	 small	 bodies	 of	 about	 20	 to	 25</p>
<p class="calibre1">infantry-men	 and	 12	 to	 15	 cavalry	 to	 a	 gun.	 Such	 a	 force	 can	 maneuver comfortably	on	a	front	of	4	or	5	feet.	Most	of	our	games	have	been	played	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	80	infantry,	50	cavalry,	3	or	4	naval	guns,	and	a	field	gun	on	either	side,	or with	 smaller	 proportional	 forces.	 We	 have	 played	 excellent	 games	 on	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">eighteen-foot	 battlefield	 with	 over	 two	 hundred	 men	 and	 six	 guns	 a	 side.	 A player	may,	of	course,	rearrange	his	forces	to	suit	his	own	convenience;	brigade</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	or	most	of	his	cavalry	into	a	powerful	striking	force,	or	what	not.	But	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">guns	 proportionally	 lead	 to	 their	 being	 put	 out	 of	 action	 too	 early	 for	 want	 of men;	a	larger	proportion	of	infantry	makes	the	game	sluggish,	and	more	cavalry</p>
<p class="calibre1">—because	 of	 the	 difficulty	 of	 keeping	 large	 bodies	 of	 this	 force	 under	 cover—</p>
<p class="calibre1">leads	 simply	 to	 early	 heavy	 losses	 by	 gunfire	 and	 violent	 and	 disastrous charging.	 The	 composition	 of	 a	 force	 may,	 of	 course,	 be	 varied	 considerably. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	 good	 Fight	 to	 a	 Finish	 game	 we	 tried	 as	 follows:	 We	 made	 the	 Country, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>tossed	 for	 choice,	 and	 then	 drew	 curtains	 across	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 field.	 Each player	then	selected	his	force	from	the	available	soldiers	in	this	way:	he	counted infantry	 as	 1	 each,	 cavalry	 as	 1-1/2,	 and	 a	 gun	 as	 10,	 and,	 taking	 whatever	 he liked	 in	 whatever	 position	 he	 liked,	 he	 made	 up	 a	 total	 of	 150.	 He	 could,	 for instance,	 choose	 100	 infantry	 and	 5	 guns,	 or	 100	 cavalry	 and	 no	 guns,	 or	 60</p>
<p class="calibre1">infantry,	 40	 cavalry,	 and	 3	 guns.	 In	 the	 result,	 a	 Boer-like	 cavalry	 force	 of	 80</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	3	guns	suffered	defeat	at	the	hands	of	110	infantry	with	4. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">SIZE	OF	THE	SOLDIERS</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 soldiers	 used	 should	 be	 all	 of	 one	 size.	 The	 best	 British	 makers	 have standardised	 sizes,	 and	 sell	 infantry	 and	 cavalry	 in	 exactly	 proportioned dimensions;	the	infantry	being	nearly	two	inches	tall.	There	is	a	lighter,	cheaper make	 of	 perhaps	 an	 inch	 and	 a	 half	 high	 that	 is	 also	 available.	 Foreign-made soldiers	are	of	variable	sizes. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Now	for	a	while	you	listen	to	General	H.	G.	W.,	of	the	Blue	Army.	You	hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">tales	 of	 victory.	 The	 photographs	 of	 the	 battlefields	 are	 by	 a	 woman	 war-correspondent,	A.	C.	W.,	a	daring	ornament	of	her	sex.	I	vanish.	I	vanish,	but	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	return.	Here,	then,	is	the	story	of	the	battle	of	Hook's	Farm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 affair	 of	 Hook's	 Farm	 was	 one	 of	 those	 brisk	 little	 things	 that	 did	 so much	to	build	up	my	early	reputation.	I	did	remarkably	well,	though	perhaps	it	is not	my	function	to	say	so.	The	enemy	was	slightly	stronger,	both	in	cavalry	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">infantry,	than	myself	[Footnote:	A	slight	but	pardonable	error	on	the	part	of	the gallant	 gentleman.	 The	 forces	 were	 exactly	 equal.];	 he	 had	 the	 choice	 of position,	 and	 opened	 the	 ball.	 Nevertheless	 I	 routed	 him.	 I	 had	 with	 me	 a compact	little	force	of	3	guns,	48	infantry,	and	25	horse.	My	instructions	were	to clear	up	the	country	to	the	east	of	Firely	Church. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We	came	very	speedily	into	touch.	I	discovered	the	enemy	advancing	upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hook's	 Farm	 and	 Firely	 Church,	 evidently	 with	 the	 intention	 of	 holding	 those two	positions	and	giving	me	a	warm	welcome.	I	have	by	me	a	photograph	or	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	battlefield	and	also	a	little	sketch	I	used	upon	the	field.	They	will	give	the intelligent	 reader	 a	 far	 better	 idea	 of	 the	 encounter	 than	 any	 so-called	 'fine writing'	can	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The	 original	 advance	 of	 the	 enemy	 was	 through	 the	 open	 country	 behind Firely	Church	and	Hook's	Farm;	I	sighted	him	between	the	points	marked	A	A</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	B	B,	and	his	force	was	divided	into	two	columns,	with	very	little	cover	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">possibility	of	communication	between	them	if	once	the	intervening	ground	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">under	 fire.	 I	 reckoned	 about	 22	 to	 his	 left	 and	 50	 or	 60	 to	 his	 right.	 [Footnote: Here	 again	 the	 gallant	 gentleman	 errs;	 this	 time	 he	 magnifies.]	 Evidently	 he meant	to	seize	both	Firely	Church	and	Hook's	Farm,	get	his	guns	into	action,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">pound	my	little	force	to	pieces	while	it	was	still	practically	in	the	open.	He	could reach	 both	 these	 admirable	 positions	 before	 I	 could	 hope	 to	 get	 a	 man	 there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	no	effective	cover	whatever	upon	my	right	that	would	have	permitted</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	advance	up	to	the	church,	and	so	I	decided	to	concentrate	my	whole	force	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>rush	upon	Hook's	Farm,	while	I	staved	off	his	left	with	gun	fire.	I	do	not	believe any	 strategist	 whatever	 could	 have	 bettered	 that	 scheme.	 My	 guns	 were	 at	 the points	marked	D	C	E,	each	with	five	horsemen,	and	I	deployed	my	infantry	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">line	 between	 D	 and	 E.	 The	 rest	 of	 my	 cavalry	 I	 ordered	 to	 advance	 on	 Hook's Farm	 from	 C.	 I	 have	 shown	 by	 arrows	 on	 the	 sketch	 the	 course	 I	 proposed	 for my	 guns.	 The	 gun	 E	 was	 to	 go	 straight	 for	 its	 assigned	 position,	 and	 get	 into action	 at	 once.	 C	 was	 not	 to	 risk	 capture	 or	 being	 put	 out	 of	 action;	 its	 exact position	was	to	be	determined	by	Red's	rapidity	in	getting	up	to	the	farm,	and	it was	to	halt	and	get	to	work	directly	it	saw	any	chance	of	effective	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Red	had	now	sighted	us.	Throughout	the	affair	he	showed	a	remarkably	poor</p>
<p class="calibre1">stomach	for	gun-fire,	and	this	was	his	undoing.	Moreover,	he	was	tempted	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">poorness	of	our	cover	on	our	right	to	attempt	to	outflank	and	enfilade	us	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Accordingly,	partly	to	get	cover	from	our	two	central	guns	and	partly	to	outflank us,	he	sent	the	whole	of	his	left	wing	to	the	left	of	Firely	Church,	where,	except for	the	gun,	it	became	almost	a	negligible	quantity.	The	gun	came	out	between</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	church	and	the	wood	into	a	position	from	which	it	did	a	considerable	amount</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 mischief	 to	 the	 infantry	 on	 our	 right,	 and	 nearly	 drove	 our	 rightmost	 gun	 in upon	 its	 supports.	 Meanwhile,	 Red's	 two	 guns	 on	 his	 right	 came	 forward	 to Hook's	Farm,	rather	badly	supported	by	his	infantry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Once	they	got	into	position	there	I	perceived	that	we	should	be	done	for,	and accordingly	I	rushed	every	available	man	forward	in	a	vigorous	counter	attack, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	my	own	two	guns	came	lumbering	up	to	the	farmhouse	corners,	and	got	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	wedge	of	shelter	close	behind	the	house	before	his	could	open	fire.	His	fire</p>
<p class="calibre1">met	my	advance,	littering	the	gentle	grass	slope	with	dead,	and	then,	hot	behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 storm	 of	 shell,	 and	 even	 as	 my	 cavalry	 gathered	 to	 charge	 his	 guns,	 he charged	mine.	I	was	amazed	beyond	measure	at	that	rush,	knowing	his	sabres	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 slightly	 outnumbered	 by	 mine.	 In	 another	 moment	 all	 the	 level	 space	 round the	 farmhouse	 was	 a	 whirling	 storm	 of	 slashing	 cavalry,	 and	 then	 we	 found ourselves	still	holding	on,	with	half	a	dozen	prisoners,	and	the	farmyard	a	perfect shambles	 of	 horses	 and	 men.	 The	 melee	 was	 over.	 His	 charge	 had	 failed,	 and, after	 a	 brief	 breathing—space	 for	 my	 shot—torn	 infantry	 to	 come	 up,	 I	 led	 on the	counter	attack.	It	was	brilliantly	successful;	a	hard	five	minutes	with	bayonet and	sabre,	and	his	right	gun	was	in	our	hands	and	his	central	one	in	jeopardy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And	now	Red	was	seized	with	that	most	fatal	disease	of	generals,	indecision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	would	neither	abandon	his	lost	gun	nor	adequately	attack	it.	He	sent	forward</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	feeble	little	infantry	attack,	that	we	cut	up	with	the	utmost	ease,	taking	several</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>prisoners,	made	a	disastrous	demonstration	from	the	church,	and	then	fell	back altogether	 from	 the	 gentle	 hill	 on	 which	 Hook	 Farm	 is	 situated	 to	 a	 position beside	 and	 behind	 an	 exposed	 cottage	 on	 the	 level.	 I	 at	 once	 opened	 out	 into	 a long	 crescent,	 with	 a	 gun	 at	 either	 horn,	 whose	 crossfire	 completely	 destroyed his	 chances	 of	 retreat	 from	 this	 ill-chosen	 last	 stand,	 and	 there	 presently	 we disabled	his	second	gun.	I	now	turned	my	attention	to	his	still	largely	unbroken</p>
<p class="calibre1">right,	from	which	a	gun	had	maintained	a	galling	fire	on	us	throughout	the	fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	might	still	have	had	some	stiff	work	getting	an	attack	home	to	the	church,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	had	had	enough	of	it,	and	now	decided	to	relieve	me	of	any	further	exertion</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 a	 precipitate	 retreat.	 My	 gun	 to	 the	 right	 of	 Hook's	 Farm	 killed	 three	 of	 his flying	men,	but	my	cavalry	were	too	badly	cut	up	for	an	effective	pursuit,	and	he got	away	to	the	extreme	left	of	his	original	positions	with	about	6	infantry-men, 4	cavalry,	and	1	gun.	He	went	none	too	soon.	Had	he	stayed,	it	would	have	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	 a	 question	 of	 time	 before	 we	 shot	 him	 to	 pieces	 and	 finished	 him altogether." </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	 far,	 and	 a	 little	 vaingloriously,	 the	 general.	 Let	 me	 now	 shrug	 my shoulders	 and	 shake	 him	 off,	 and	 go	 over	 this	 battle	 he	 describes	 a	 little	 more exactly	with	the	help	of	the	photographs.	The	battle	is	a	small,	compact	game	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Fight-to-a-Finish	type,	and	it	was	arranged	as	simply	as	possible	in	order	to permit	of	a	full	and	exact	explanation. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	 1	 shows	 the	 country	 of	 the	 battlefield	 put	 out;	 on	 the	 right	 is	 the church,	 on	 the	 left	 (near	 the	 centre	 of	 the	 plate)	 is	 the	 farm.	 In	 the	 hollow between	 the	 two	 is	 a	 small	 outbuilding.	 Directly	 behind	 the	 farm	 in	 the	 line	 of vision	is	another	outbuilding.	This	is	more	distinctly	seen	in	other	photographs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind,	the	chalk	back	line	is	clear.	Red	has	won	the	toss,	both	for	the	choice	of a	side	and,	after	making	that	choice,	for	first	move,	and	his	force	is	already	put out	 upon	 the	 back	 line.	 For	 the	 sake	 of	 picturesqueness,	 the	 men	 are	 not	 put exactly	 on	 the	 line,	 but	 each	 will	 have	 his	 next	 move	 measured	 from	 that	 line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	has	broken	his	force	into	two,	a	fatal	error,	as	we	shall	see,	in	view	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>wide	 space	 of	 open	 ground	 between	 the	 farm	 and	 the	 church.	 He	 has	 1	 gun,	 5</p>
<p class="calibre1">cavalry,	and	13	infantry	on	his	left,	who	are	evidently	to	take	up	a	strong	position by	the	church	and	enfilade	Blue's	position;	Red's	right,	of	2	guns,	20	cavalry,	and 37	infantry	aim	at	the	seizure	of	the	farm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	 2	 is	 a	 near	 view	 of	 Blue's	 side,	 with	 his	 force	 put	 down.	 He	 has grasped	the	strategic	mistake	of	Red,	and	is	going	to	fling	every	man	at	the	farm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 right,	 of	 5	 cavalry	 and	 16	 infantry,	 will	 get	 up	 as	 soon	 as	 possible	 to	 the woods	near	the	centre	of	the	field	(whence	the	fire	of	their	gun	will	be	able	to	cut off	 the	 two	 portions	 of	 Red's	 force	 from	 each	 other),	 and	 then,	 leaving	 the	 gun there	 with	 sufficient	 men	 to	 serve	 it,	 the	 rest	 of	 this	 party	 will	 push	 on	 to	 co-operate	with	the	main	force	of	their	comrades	in	the	inevitable	scrimmage	for	the farm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	3	shows	the	fight	after	Red	and	Blue	have	both	made	their	first	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	taken	from	Red's	side.	Red	has	not	as	yet	realised	the	danger	of	his	position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	left	gun	struggles	into	position	to	the	left	of	the	church,	his	centre	and	right push	for	the	farm.	Blue's	five	cavalry	on	his	left	have	already	galloped	forward</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	a	favourable	position	to	open	fire	at	the	next	move—they	are	a	little	hidden in	the	picture	by	the	church;	the	sixteen	infantry	follow	hard,	and	his	main	force makes	straight	for	the	farm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	4	shows	the	affair	developing	rapidly.	Red's	cavalry	on	his	right	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken	his	two	guns	well	forward	into	a	position	to	sweep	either	side	of	the	farm, and	his	left	gun	is	now	well	placed	to	pound	Blue's	infantry	centre.	His	infantry continue	to	press	forward,	but	Blue,	for	his	second	move,	has	already	opened	fire from	 the	 woods	 with	 his	 right	 gun,	 and	 killed	 three	 of	 Red's	 men.	 His	 infantry have	now	come	up	to	serve	this	gun,	and	the	cavalry	who	brought	it	into	position</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	the	first	move	have	now	left	it	to	them	in	order	to	gallop	over	to	join	the	force attacking	the	farm.	Undismayed	by	Red's	guns,	Blue	has	brought	his	other	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">guns	 and	 his	 men	 as	 close	 to	 the	 farm	 as	 they	 can	 go.	 His	 leftmost	 gun	 stares Red's	 in	 the	 face,	 and	 prevents	 any	 effective	 fire,	 his	 middle	 gun	 faces	 Red's middle	gun.	Some	of	his	cavalry	are	exposed	to	the	right	of	the	farm,	but	most</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	completely	covered	now	by	the	farm	from	Red's	fire.	Red	has	now	to	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 nature	 of	 his	 position	 is	 becoming	 apparent	 to	 him.	 His	 right	 gun	 is ineffective,	his	left	and	his	centre	guns	cannot	kill	more	than	seven	or	eight	men between	them;	and	at	the	next	move,	unless	he	can	silence	them,	Blue's	guns	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	mowing	his	exposed	cavalry	down	from	the	security	of	the	farm.	He	is	in	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fix.	 How	 is	 he	 to	 get	 out	 of	 it?	 His	 cavalry	 are	 slightly	 outnumbered,	 but	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>decides	to	do	as	much	execution	as	he	can	with	his	own	guns,	charge	the	Blue guns	before	him,	and	then	bring	up	his	infantry	to	save	the	situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	 5a	 shows	 the	 result	 of	 Red's	 move.	 His	 two	 effective	 guns	 have between	them	bowled	over	two	cavalry	and	six	infantry	in	the	gap	between	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">farm	 and	 Blue's	 right	 gun;	 and	 then,	 following	 up	 the	 effect	 of	 his	 gunfire,	 his cavalry	 charges	 home	 over	 the	 Blue	 guns.	 One	 oversight	 he	 makes,	 to	 which Blue	 at	 once	 calls	 his	 attention	 at	 the	 end	 of	 his	 move.	 Red	 has	 reckoned	 on twenty	cavalry	for	his	charge,	forgetting	that	by	the	rules	he	must	put	two	men	at the	tail	of	his	middle	gun.	His	infantry	are	just	not	able	to	come	up	for	this	duty, and	 consequently	 two	 cavalry-men	 have	 to	 be	 set	 there.	 The	 game	 then	 pauses while	the	players	work	out	the	cavalry	melee.	Red	has	brought	up	eighteen	men</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	this;	in	touch	or	within	six	inches	of	touch	there	are	twenty-one	Blue	cavalry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red's	force	is	isolated,	for	only	two	of	his	men	are	within	a	move,	and	to	support eighteen	he	would	have	to	have	nine.	By	the	rules	this	gives	fifteen	men	dead	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">either	side	and	three	Red	prisoners	to	Blue.	By	the	rules	also	it	rests	with	Red	to indicate	the	survivors	within	the	limits	of	the	melee	as	he	chooses.	He	takes	very good	care	there	are	not	four	men	within	six	inches	of	either	Blue	gun,	and	both</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	are	out	of	action	therefore	for	Blue's	next	move.	Of	course	Red	would	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">done	 far	 better	 to	 have	 charged	 home	 with	 thirteen	 men	 only,	 leaving	 seven	 in support,	but	he	was	flurried	by	his	comparatively	unsuccessful	shooting—he	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted	 to	 hit	 more	 cavalry—and	 by	 the	 gun-trail	 mistake.	 Moreover,	 he	 had counted	his	antagonist	wrongly,	and	thought	he	could	arrange	a	melee	of	twenty</p>
<p class="calibre1">against	twenty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Figure	 5b	 shows	 the	 game	 at	 the	 same	 stage	 as	 5a,	 immediately	 after	 the adjudication	of	the	melee.	The	dead	have	been	picked	up,	the	three	prisoners,	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	slight	deflection	of	the	rules	in	the	direction	of	the	picturesque,	turn	their	faces towards	captivity,	and	the	rest	of	the	picture	is	exactly	in	the	position	of	5a. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	is	now	Blue's	turn	to	move,	and	figure	6a	shows	the	result	of	his	move.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">fires	 his	 rightmost	 gun	 (the	 nose	 of	 it	 is	 just	 visible	 to	 the	 right)	 and	 kills	 one infantry-man	and	one	cavalry-man	(at	the	tail	of	Red's	central	gun),	brings	up	his surviving	 eight	 cavalry	 into	 convenient	 positions	 for	 the	 service	 of	 his temporarily	 silenced	 guns,	 and	 hurries	 his	 infantry	 forward	 to	 the	 farm, recklessly	exposing	them	in	the	thin	wood	between	the	farm	and	his	right	gun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 attentive	 reader	 will	 be	 able	 to	 trace	 all	 this	 in	 figure	 6a,	 and	 he	 will	 also note	 the	 three	 Red	 cavalry	 prisoners	 going	 to	 the	 rear	 under	 the	 escort	 of	 one Khaki	infantry	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>Figure	6b	shows	exactly	the	same	stage	as	figure	6a,	that	is	to	say,	the	end	of Blue's	 third	 move.	 A	 cavalry-man	 lies	 dead	 at	 the	 tail	 of	 Red's	 middle	 gun,	 an infantry-man	 a	 little	 behind	 it.	 His	 rightmost	 gun	 is	 abandoned	 and	 partly masked,	but	not	hidden,	from	the	observer,	by	a	tree	to	the	side	of	the	farmhouse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	now,	what	is	Red	to	do? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	reader	will	probably	have	his	own	ideas,	as	I	have	mine.	What	Red	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	in	the	actual	game	was	to	lose	his	head,	and	then	at	the	end	of	four	minutes' </p>
<p class="calibre1">deliberation	he	had	to	move,	he	blundered	desperately.	He	opened	fire	on	Blue's</p>
<p class="calibre1">exposed	centre	and	killed	eight	men.	(Their	bodies	litter	the	ground	in	figure	7, which	gives	a	complete	bird's-eye	view	of	the	battle.)	He	then	sent	forward	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">isolated	six	or	seven	men	in	a	wild	attempt	to	recapture	his	lost	gun,	massed	his other	 men	 behind	 the	 inadequate	 cover	 of	 his	 central	 gun,	 and	 sent	 the detachment	of	infantry	that	had	hitherto	lurked	uselessly	behind	the	church,	in	a frantic	 and	 hopeless	 rush	 across	 the	 open	 to	 join	 them.	 (The	 one	 surviving cavalry-man	 on	 his	 right	 wing	 will	 be	 seen	 taking	 refuge	 behind	 the	 cottage.) There	 can	 be	 little	 question	 of	 the	 entire	 unsoundness	 of	 all	 these	 movements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red	 was	 at	 a	 disadvantage,	 he	 had	 failed	 to	 capture	 the	 farm,	 and	 his	 business now	was	manifestly	to	save	his	men	as	much	as	possible,	make	a	defensive	fight</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	it,	inflict	as	much	damage	as	possible	with	his	leftmost	gun	on	Blue's	advance, get	the	remnants	of	his	right	across	to	the	church—the	cottage	in	the	centre	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	own	gun	would	have	given	them	a	certain	amount	of	cover—and	build	up	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">new	position	about	that	building	as	a	pivot.	With	two	guns	right	and	left	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">church	he	might	conceivably	have	saved	the	rest	of	the	fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That,	 however,	 is	 theory;	 let	 us	 return	 to	 fact.	 Figure	 8	 gives	 the	 disastrous consequences	of	Red's	last	move.	Blue	has	moved,	his	guns	have	slaughtered	ten</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 Red's	 wretched	 foot,	 and	 a	 rush	 of	 nine	 Blue	 cavalry	 and	 infantry	 mingles with	Red's	six	surviving	infantry	about	the	disputed	gun.	These	infantry	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">definition	are	isolated;	there	are	not	three	other	Reds	within	a	move	of	them.	The view	in	this	photograph	also	is	an	extensive	one,	and	the	reader	will	note,	as	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">painful	accessory,	the	sad	spectacle	of	three	Red	prisoners	receding	to	the	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	melee	about	Red's	lost	gun	works	out,	of	course,	at	three	dead	on	each	side, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	three	more	Red	prisoners. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henceforth	the	battle	moves	swiftly	to	complete	the	disaster	of	Red.	Shaken</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	demoralised,	that	unfortunate	general	is	now	only	for	retreat.	His	next	move, of	which	I	have	no	picture,	is	to	retreat	the	infantry	he	has	so	wantonly	exposed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>back	to	the	shelter	of	the	church,	to	withdraw	the	wreckage	of	his	right	into	the cover	 of	 the	 cottage,	 and—one	 last	 gleam	 of	 enterprise—to	 throw	 forward	 his left	gun	into	a	position	commanding	Blue's	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fig.	8--Battle	of	Hook's	Farm.	The	Red	Army	suffers	Heavy	Loss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fig.	9--Battle	of	Hook's	Farm.	Complete	Victory	of	the	Blue	Army. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blue	 then	 pounds	 Red's	 right	 with	 his	 gun	 to	 the	 right	 of	 the	 farm	 and	 kills three	men.	He	extends	his	other	gun	to	the	left	of	the	farm,	right	out	among	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">trees,	so	as	to	get	an	effective	fire	next	time	upon	the	tail	of	Red's	gun.	He	also moves	up	sufficient	men	to	take	possession	of	Red's	lost	gun.	On	the	right	Blue's gun	engages	Red's	and	kills	one	man.	All	this	the	reader	will	see	clearly	in	figure 9,	 and	 he	 will	 also	 note	 a	 second	 batch	 of	 Red	 prisoners—this	 time	 they	 are infantry,	 going	 rearward.	 Figure	 9	 is	 the	 last	 picture	 that	 is	 needed	 to	 tell	 the story	 of	 the	 battle.	 Red's	 position	 is	 altogether	 hopeless.	 He	 has	 four	 men	 left alive	 by	 his	 rightmost	 gun,	 and	 their	 only	 chance	 is	 to	 attempt	 to	 save	 that	 by retreating	with	it.	If	they	fire	it,	one	or	other	will	certainly	be	killed	at	its	tail	in Blue's	subsequent	move,	and	then	the	gun	will	be	neither	movable	nor	fireable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red's	 left	 gun,	 with	 four	 men	 only,	 is	 also	 in	 extreme	 peril,	 and	 will	 be immovable	and	helpless	if	it	loses	another	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Very	properly	Red	decided	upon	retreat.	His	second	gun	had	to	be	abandoned</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	one	move,	but	two	of	the	men	with	it	escaped	over	his	back	line.	Five	of	the infantry	 behind	 the	 church	 escaped,	 and	 his	 third	 gun	 and	 its	 four	 cavalry	 got away	 on	 the	 extreme	 left-hand	 corner	 of	 Red's	 position.	 Blue	 remained	 on	 the field,	completely	victorious,	with	two	captured	guns	and	six	prisoners. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	you	have	a	scientific	record	of	the	worthy	general's	little	affair. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a><b class="calibre3">EXTENSIONS	AND	AMPLIFICATIONS	OF	LITTLE	WAR</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	that	battle	of	Hook's	Farm	is,	as	I	have	explained,	a	simplification	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">game,	 set	 out	 entirely	 to	 illustrate	 the	 method	 of	 playing;	 there	 is	 scarcely	 a battle	that	will	not	prove	more	elaborate	(and	eventful)	than	this	little	encounter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 a	 number	 of	 players	 and	 a	 sufficiently	 large	 room	 can	 be	 got,	 there	 is	 no reason	 why	 armies	 of	 many	 hundreds	 of	 soldiers	 should	 not	 fight	 over	 many square	yards	of	model	country.	So	long	as	each	player	has	about	a	hundred	men</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 three	 guns	 there	 is	 no	 need	 to	 lengthen	 the	 duration	 of	 a	 game	 on	 that account.	But	it	is	too	laborious	and	confusing	for	a	single	player	to	handle	more than	that	number	of	men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,	 on	 a	 big	 floor	 with	 an	 extensive	 country	 it	 is	 possible	 to	 begin moving	with	moves	double	or	treble	the	length	here	specified,	and	to	come	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	moves	of	the	ordinary	lengths	when	the	troops	are	within	fifteen	or	twelve	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">ten	 feet	 of	 each	 other.	 To	 players	 with	 the	 time	 and	 space	 available	 I	 would suggest	using	a	quite	large	country,	beginning	with	treble	moves,	and,	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">exception	 of	 a	 select	 number	 of	 cavalry	 scouts,	 keeping	 the	 soldiers	 in	 their boxes	with	the	lids	on,	and	moving	the	boxes	as	units.	(This	boxing	idea	is	a	new one,	and	affords	a	very	good	substitute	for	the	curtain;	I	have	tried	it	twice	for games	in	the	open	air	where	the	curtain	was	not	available.)	Neither	side	would, </p>
<p class="calibre1">of	course,	know	what	the	other	had	in	its	boxes;	they	might	be	packed	regiments</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 a	 mere	 skeleton	 force.	 Each	 side	 would	 advance	 on	 the	 other	 by	 double	 or treble	moves	behind	a	screen	of	cavalry	scouts,	until	a	scout	was	within	ten	feet of	 a	 box	 on	 the	 opposite	 side.	 Then	 the	 contents	 of	 that	 particular	 box	 would have	 to	 be	 disclosed	 and	 the	 men	 stood	 out.	 Troops	 without	 any	 enemy	 within twenty	 feet	 could	 be	 returned	 to	 their	 boxes	 for	 facility	 in	 moving.	 Playing	 on such	 a	 scale	 would	 admit	 also	 of	 the	 introduction	 of	 the	 problem	 of	 provisions and	 supplies.	 Little	 toy	 Army	 Service	 waggons	 can	 be	 bought,	 and	 it	 could	 be ruled	that	troops	must	have	one	such	waggon	for	every	fifty	men	within	at	least</p>
<p class="calibre1">six	moves.	Moreover,	ammunition	carts	may	be	got,	and	it	may	be	ruled	that	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">must	be	within	two	moves	of	a	gun	before	the	latter	can	be	fired.	All	these	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">complications	of	the	War	Game,	and	so	far	I	have	not	been	able	to	get	together</p>
<p class="calibre1">sufficient	 experienced	 players	 to	 play	 on	 this	 larger,	 more	 elaborate	 scale.	 It	 is only	 after	 the	 smaller	 simpler	 war	 game	 here	 described	 has	 been	 played	 a number	 of	 times,	 and	 its	 little	 dodges	 mastered	 completely,	 that	 such	 more warlike	devices	become	practicable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 obviously	 with	 a	 team	 of	 players	 and	 an	 extensive	 country,	 one	 could</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>have	a	general	controlling	the	whole	campaign,	divisional	commanders,	batteries of	guns,	specialised	brigades,	and	a	quite	military	movement	of	the	whole	affair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 have	 (as	 several	 illustrations	 show)	 tried	 Little	 Wars	 in	 the	 open	 air.	 The	 toy soldiers	 stand	 quite	 well	 on	 closely	 mown	 grass,	 but	 the	 long-range	 gun-fire becomes	 a	 little	 uncertain	 if	 there	 is	 any	 breeze.	 It	 gives	 a	 greater	 freedom	 of movement	and	allows	the	players	to	lie	down	more	comfortably	when	firing,	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">increase,	and	even	double,	the	moves	of	the	indoor	game.	One	can	mark	out	high</p>
<p class="calibre1">roads	and	streams	with	an	ordinary	lawn-tennis	marker,	mountains	and	rocks	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">stones,	and	woods	and	forests	of	twigs	are	easily	arranged.	But	if	the	game	is	to be	left	out	all	night	and	continued	next	day	(a	thing	I	have	as	yet	had	no	time	to try),	the	houses	must	be	of	some	more	solid	material	than	paper.	I	would	suggest</p>
<p class="calibre1">painted	 blocks	 of	 wood.	 On	 a	 large	 lawn,	 a	 wide	 country-side	 may	 be	 easily represented.	 The	 players	 may	 begin	 with	 a	 game	 exactly	 like	 the	 ordinary Kriegspiel,	with	scouts	and	boxed	soldiers,	which	will	develop	into	such	battles</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	are	here	described,	as	the	troops	come	into	contact.	It	would	be	easy	to	give</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 roads	 a	 real	 significance	 by	 permitting	 a	 move	 half	 as	 long	 again	 as	 in	 the open	country	for	waggons	or	boxed	troops	along	a	road.	There	is	a	possibility	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">having	 a	 toy	 railway,	 with	 stations	 or	 rolling	 stock	 into	 which	 troops	 might	 be put,	 on	 such	 a	 giant	 war	 map.	 One	 would	 allow	 a	 move	 for	 entraining	 and another	 for	 detraining,	 requiring	 the	 troops	 to	 be	 massed	 alongside	 the	 train	 at the	beginning	and	end	of	each	journey,	and	the	train	might	move	at	four	or	five</p>
<p class="calibre1">times	the	cavalry	rate.	One	would	use	open	trucks	and	put	in	a	specified	number</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	men—say	twelve	infantry	or	five	cavalry	or	half	a	gun	per	truck—and	permit</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	engine	to	draw	seven	or	eight	trucks,	or	move	at	a	reduced	speed	with	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	 could	 also	 rule	 that	 four	 men—the	 same	 four	 men—remaining	 on	 a	 line during	two	moves,	could	tear	up	a	rail,	and	eight	men	in	three	moves	replace	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	will	confess	I	have	never	yet	tried	over	these	more	elaborate	developments</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 Little	 Wars,	 partly	 because	 of	 the	 limited	 time	 at	 my	 disposal,	 and	 partly because	they	all	demand	a	number	of	players	who	are	well	acquainted	with	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">(so	 far)	 of	 Little	 Wars,	 there	 has	 fallen	 to	 me	 a	 disproportionate	 share	 of victories.	But	let	me	not	boast.	For	the	present,	I	have	done	all	that	I	meant	to	do in	this	matter.	It	is	for	you,	dear	reader,	now	to	get	a	floor,	a	friend,	some	soldiers and	 some	 guns,	 and	 show	 by	 a	 grovelling	 devotion	 your	 appreciation	 of	 this noble	and	beautiful	gift	of	a	limitless	game	that	I	have	given	you. </p>

<p class="calibre1">or	 embarrassment	 of	 every	 gracious,	 bold,	 sweet,	 and	 charming	 thing,	 that	 we who	 are	 old	 enough	 to	 remember	 a	 real	 modern	 war	 know	 to	 be	 the	 reality	 of belligerence.	This	world	is	for	ample	living;	we	want	security	and	freedom;	all</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">APPENDIX</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">LITTLE	WARS	AND	KRIEGSPIEL</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">THIS	little	book	has,	I	hope,	been	perfectly	frank	about	its	intentions.	It	is	not a	 book	 upon	 Kriegspiel.	 It	 gives	 merely	 a	 game	 that	 may	 be	 played	 by	 two	 or four	or	six	amateurish	persons	in	an	afternoon	and	evening	with	toy	soldiers.	But it	has	a	very	distinct	relation	to	Kriegspiel;	and	since	the	main	portion	of	it	was written	 and	 published	 in	 a	 magazine,	 I	 have	 had	 quite	 a	 considerable</p>
<p class="calibre1">correspondence	 with	 military	 people	 who	 have	 been	 interested	 by	 it,	 and	 who have	shown	a	very	friendly	spirit	towards	it—in	spite	of	the	pacific	outbreak	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">its	 concluding	 section.	 They	 tell	 me—what	 I	 already	 a	 little	 suspected—that Kriegspiel,	as	it	is	played	by	the	British	Army,	is	a	very	dull	and	unsatisfactory exercise,	lacking	in	realism,	in	stir	and	the	unexpected,	obsessed	by	the	umpire</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 every	 turn,	 and	 of	 very	 doubtful	 value	 in	 waking	 up	 the	 imagination,	 which should	 be	 its	 chief	 function.	 I	 am	 particularly	 indebted	 to	 Colonel	 Mark	 Sykes for	 advice	 and	 information	 in	 this	 matter.	 He	 has	 pointed	 out	 to	 me	 the possibility	 of	 developing	 Little	 Wars	 into	 a	 vivid	 and	 inspiring	 Kriegspiel,	 in which	the	element	of	the	umpire	would	be	reduced	to	a	minimum;	and	it	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	ungrateful	to	him,	and	a	waste	of	an	interesting	opportunity,	if	I	did	not	add this	Appendix,	pointing	out	how	a	Kriegspiel	of	real	educational	value	for	junior officers	 may	 be	 developed	 out	 of	 the	 amusing	 methods	 of	 Little	 War.	 If	 Great</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>War	 is	 to	 be	 played	 at	 all,	 the	 better	 it	 is	 played	 the	 more	 humanely	 it	 will	 be done.	 I	 see	 no	 inconsistency	 in	 deploring	 the	 practice	 while	 perfecting	 the method.	 But	 I	 am	 a	 civilian,	 and	 Kriegspiel	 is	 not	 my	 proper	 business.	 I	 am deeply	preoccupied	with	a	novel	I	am	writing,	and	so	I	think	the	best	thing	I	can do	is	just	to	set	down	here	all	the	ideas	that	have	cropped	up	in	my	mind,	in	the footsteps,	so	to	speak,	of	Colonel	Sykes,	and	leave	it	to	the	military	expert,	if	he cares	to	take	the	matter	up,	to	reduce	my	scattered	suggestions	to	a	system. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now,	 first,	 it	 is	 manifest	 that	 in	 Little	 Wars	 there	 is	 no	 equivalent	 for	 rifle-fire,	and	that	the	effect	of	the	gun-fire	has	no	resemblance	to	the	effect	of	shell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	may	be	altered	very	simply.	Let	the	rules	as	to	gun-fire	be	as	they	are	now, but	let	a	different	projectile	be	used—a	projectile	that	will	drop	down	and	stay</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	it	falls.	I	find	that	one	can	buy	in	ironmongers'	shops	small	brass	screws</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	various	sizes	and	weights,	but	all	capable	of	being	put	in	the	muzzle	of	the	4'7</p>
<p class="calibre1">guns	without	slipping	down	the	barrel.	If,	with	such	a	screw	in	the	muzzle,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">gun	is	loaded	and	fired,	the	wooden	bolt	remains	in	the	gun	and	the	screw	flies</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	drops	and	stays	near	where	it	falls—its	range	being	determined	by	the	size</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	weight	of	screw	selected	by	the	gunner.	Let	us	assume	this	is	a	shell,	and	it is	quite	easy	to	make	a	rule	that	will	give	the	effect	of	its	explosion.	Half,	or,	in the	case	of	an	odd	number,	one	more	than	half,	of	the	men	within	three	inches	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	 shell	 are	 dead,	 and	 if	 there	 is	 a	 gun	 completely	 within	 the	 circle	 of	 three inches	 radius	 from	 the	 shell,	 it	 is	 destroyed.	 If	 it	 is	 not	 completely	 within	 the circle,	it	is	disabled	for	two	moves.	A	supply	waggon	is	completely	destroyed	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 falls	 wholly	 or	 partially	 within	 the	 radius.	 But	 if	 there	 is	 a	 wall,	 house,	 or entrenchment	 between	 any	 men	 and	 the	 shell,	 they	 are	 uninjured—they	 do	 not count	in	the	reckoning	of	the	effect	of	the	shell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	think	one	can	get	a	practical	imitation	of	the	effect	of	rifle-fire	by	deciding that	for	every	five	infantry-men	who	are	roughly	in	a	line,	and	who	do	not	move</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	any	particular	move,	there	may	be	one	(ordinary)	shot	taken	with	a	4'7	gun.	It may	be	fired	from	any	convenient	position	behind	the	row	of	five	men,	so	long</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	the	shot	passes	roughly	over	the	head	of	the	middle	man	of	the	five. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of	 course,	 while	 in	 Little	 Wars	 there	 are	 only	 three	 or	 four	 players,	 in	 any proper	Kriegspiel	the	game	will	go	on	over	a	larger	area—in	a	drill-hall	or	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">such	 place—and	 each	 arm	 and	 service	 will	 be	 entrusted	 to	 a	 particular	 player. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	permits	all	sorts	of	complicated	imitations	of	reality	that	are	impossible	to our	 parlour	 and	 playroom	 Little	 Wars.	 We	 can	 consider	 transport,	 supply, ammunition,	and	the	moral	effect	of	cavalry	impact,	and	of	uphill	and	downhill</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>movements.	We	can	also	bring	in	the	spade	and	entrenchment,	and	give	scope	to the	Royal	Engineers.	But	before	I	write	anything	of	Colonel	Sykes'	suggestions</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	these,	let	me	say	a	word	or	two	about	Kriegspiel	"country." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 country	 for	 Kriegspiel	 should	 be	 made	 up,	 I	 think,	 of	 heavy	 blocks	 or boxes	of	wood	about	3	x	3	x	1/2	feet,	and	curved	pieces	(with	a	rounded	outline</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	a	chord	of	three	feet,	or	shaped	like	right-angled	triangles	with	an	incurved hypotenuse	and	two	straight	sides	of	3	feet)	can	easily	be	contrived	to	round	off corners	and	salient	angles.	These	blocks	can	be	bored	to	take	trees,	etc.,	exactly as	the	boards	in	Little	Wars	are	bored,	and	with	them	a	very	passable	model	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	particular	country	can	be	built	up	from	a	contoured	Ordnance	map.	Houses</p>
<p class="calibre1">may	 be	 made	 very	 cheaply	 by	 shaping	 a	 long	 piece	 of	 wood	 into	 a	 house-like section	and	sawing	it	up.	There	will	always	be	someone	who	will	touch	up	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">paint	 and	 stick	 windows	 on	 to	 and	 generally	 adorn	 and	 individualise	 such houses,	which	are,	of	course,	the	stabler	the	heavier	the	wood	used.	The	rest	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	country	as	in	Little	Wars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon	such	a	country	a	Kriegspiel	could	be	played	with	rules	upon	the	lines	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	following	sketch	rules,	which	are	the	result	of	a	discussion	between	Colonel</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sykes	 and	 myself,	 and	 in	 which	 most	 of	 the	 new	 ideas	 are	 to	 be	 ascribed	 to Colonel	Sykes.	We	proffer	them,	not	as	a	finished	set	of	rules,	but	as	material	for anyone	 who	 chooses	 to	 work	 over	 them,	 in	 the	 elaboration	 of	 what	 we	 believe will	 be	 a	 far	 more	 exciting	 and	 edifying	 Kriegspiel	 than	 any	 that	 exists	 at	 the present	time.	The	game	may	be	played	by	any	number	of	players,	according	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	forces	engaged	and	the	size	of	the	country	available.	Each	side	will	be	under the	 supreme	 command	 of	 a	 General,	 who	 will	 be	 represented	 by	 a	 cavalry soldier.	 The	 player	 who	 is	 General	 must	 stand	 at	 or	 behind	 his	 representative image	and	within	six	feet	of	it.	His	signalling	will	be	supposed	to	be	perfect,	and he	 will	 communicate	 with	 his	 subordinates	 by	 shout,	 whisper,	 or	 note,	 as	 he thinks	fit.	I	suggest	he	should	be	considered	invulnerable,	but	Colonel	Sykes	has proposed	arrangements	for	his	disablement.	He	would	have	it	that	if	the	General</p>
<p class="calibre1">falls	 within	 the	 zone	 of	 destruction	 of	 a	 shell	 he	 must	 go	 out	 of	 the	 room	 for three	moves	(injured);	and	that	if	he	is	hit	by	rifle-fire	or	captured	he	shall	quit the	game,	and	be	succeeded	by	his	next	subordinate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	as	to	the	Moves. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>It	is	suggested	that:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Infantry	shall	move	one	foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cavalry	shall	move	three	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	above	moves	are	increased	by	one	half	for	troops	in	twos</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	fours	on	a	road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Royal	Engineers	shall	move	two	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Royal	Artillery	shall	move	two	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Transport	and	Supply	shall	move	one	foot	on	roads,	half	foot</p>
<p class="calibre1">across	country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	General	shall	move	six	feet	(per	motor),	three	feet	across	country. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boats	shall	move	one	foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	moving	uphill,	one	contour	counts	as	one	foot;	downhill,	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">contours	count	as	one	foot.	Where	there	are	four	contours	to	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">foot	vertical	the	hill	is	impassable	for	wheels	unless	there	is	a	road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Infantry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	pass	a	fordable	river	=	one	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	change	from	fours	to	two	ranks	=	half	a	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	change	from	two	ranks	to	extension	=	half	a	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	embark	into	boats	=	two	moves	for	every	twenty	men</p>

<p class="calibre1">To	disembark	=	one	move	for	every	twenty	men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cavalry. </p>

<p class="calibre1">To	unlimber	guns	=	half	a	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	limber	up	guns	=	half	a	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rivers	are	impassable	to	guns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">NEITHER	 INFANTRY,	 CAVALRY,	 NOR	 ARTILLERY	 CAN	 FIRE	 AND</p>
<p class="calibre1">MOVE	IN	ONE	MOVE. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Royal	Engineers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	repairs	can	be	commenced,	no	destructions	can	be	begun, </p>
<p class="calibre1">during	a	move	in	which	R.E.	have	changed	position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rivers	impassable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Transport	and	Supply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No	supplies	or	stores	can	be	delivered	during	a	move	if	T.	and	S. </p>
<p class="calibre1">have	moved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rivers	impassable. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>Next	as	to	Supply	in	the	Field:</p>
<p class="calibre1">All	 troops	 must	 be	 kept	 supplied	 with	 food,	 ammunition,	 and	 forage.	 The players	 must	 give	 up,	 every	 six	 moves,	 one	 packet	 of	 food	 per	 thirty	 men;	 one packet	 of	 forage	 per	 six	 horses;	 one	 packet	 of	 ammunition	 per	 thirty	 infantry which	fire	for	six	consecutive	moves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	supplies,	at	the	time	when	they	are	given	up,	must	be	within	six	feet	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	infantry	they	belong	to	and	eighteen	feet	of	the	cavalry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Isolated	 bodies	 of	 less	 than	 thirty	 infantry	 require	 no	 supplies—a	 body	 is isolated	if	it	is	more	than	twelve	feet	off	another	body.	In	calculating	supplies	for infantry	the	fractions	either	count	as	thirty	if	fifteen	or	over,	or	as	nothing	if	less than	fifteen.	Thus	forty-six	infantry	require	two	packets	of	food	or	ammunition; </p>
<p class="calibre1">forty-four	infantry	require	one	packet	of	food. </p>
<p class="calibre1">N.B.—Supplies	 are	 not	 effective	 if	 enemy	 is	 between	 supplies	 and	 troops they	belong	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Men	surrounded	and	besieged	must	be	victualled	at	the	following	rate:—</p>
<p class="calibre1">One	packet	food	for	every	thirty	men	for	every	six	moves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	packet	forage	every	six	horses	for	every	six	moves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	event	of	supplies	failing,	horses	may	take	the	place	of	food,	but	not	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">course	of	forage;	one	horse	to	equal	one	packet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	event	of	supplies	failing,	the	following	consequences	ensue:—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Infantry	 without	 ammunition	 cannot	 fire	 (guns	 are	 supposed	 to	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">unlimited	ammunition	with	them). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Infantry,	cavalry,	R.A.,	and	R.E.	cannot	move	without	supply—if	supplies	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	provided	within	six	consecutive	moves,	they	are	out	of	action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	force	surrounded	must	surrender	four	moves	after	eating	its	last	horse. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>Now	as	to	Destructions:</p>
<p class="calibre1">To	 destroy	 a	 railway	 bridge	 R.E.	 take	 two	 moves;	 to	 repair,	 R.E.	 take	 ten moves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	 destroy	 a	 railway	 culvert	 R.E.	 take	 one	 move;	 to	 repair	 R.E.	 take	 five moves.	 To	 destroy	 a	 river	 road	 bridge	 R.E.	 take	 one	 move;	 to	 repair,	 R.E.	 take five	moves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 supply	 depot	 can	 be	 destroyed	 by	 one	 man	 in	 two	 moves,	 no	 matter	 how large	(by	fire). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Four	men	can	destroy	the	contents	of	six	waggons	in	one	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 contact	 mine	 can	 be	 placed	 on	 a	 road	 or	 in	 any	 place	 by	 two	 men	 in	 six moves;	 it	 will	 be	 exploded	 by	 the	 first	 pieces	 passing	 over	 it,	 and	 will	 destroy everything	within	six	inches	radius.*</p>
<p class="calibre1">Next	as	to	Constructions:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Entrenchments	can	be	made	by	infantry	in	four	moves.*	They	are	to	be	strips</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 wood	 two	 inches	 high	 tacked	 to	 the	 country,	 or	 wooden	 bricks	 two	 inches high.	Two	men	may	make	an	inch	of	entrenchment. </p>

<p class="calibre1">[*	 Notice	 to	 be	 given	 to	 umpire	 of	 commencement	 of	 any	 work	 or	 the	 placing	 of	 a mine.	 In	 event	 of	 no	 umpire	 being	 available,	 a	 folded	 note	 must	 be	 put	 on	 the mantelpiece	when	entrenchment	is	commenced,	and	opponent	asked	to	open	it	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	trench	is	completed	or	the	mine	exploded.]</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rules	as	to	Cavalry	Charging:</p>
<p class="calibre1">No	 body	 of	 less	 than	 eight	 cavalry	 may	 charge,	 and	 they	 must	 charge	 in proper	formation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>If	cavalry	charges	infantry	in	extended	order—</p>
<p class="calibre1">If	the	charge	starts	at	a	distance	of	more	than	two	feet,	the	cavalry	loses	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	 for	 every	 five	 infantry-men	 charged,	 and	 the	 infantry	 loses	 one	 man	 for each	sabre	charging. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	less	than	two	feet	and	more	than	one	foot,	the	cavalry	loses	one	man	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">every	ten	charged,	and	the	infantry	two	men	for	each	sabre	charging. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	less	than	one	foot,	the	cavalry	loses	one	man	for	every	fifteen	charged,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	infantry	three	men	for	each	sabre	charging. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	cavalry	charges	infantry	in	close	order,	the	result	is	reversed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus	 at	 more	 than	 two	 feet	 one	 infantry-man	 kills	 three	 cavalry-men,	 and fifteen	cavalry-men	one	infantry-man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	more	than	one	foot	one	infantry-man	kills	two	cavalry,	and	ten	cavalry	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">infantry. </p>

<p class="calibre1">However,	infantry	that	have	been	charged	in	close	order	are	immobile	for	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">Infantry	 charged	 in	 extended	 order	 must	 on	 the	 next	 move	 retire	 one	 foot; they	can	be	charged	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	cavalry	charges	cavalry:—</p>
<p class="calibre1">If	cavalry	is	within	charging	distance	of	the	enemy's	cavalry	at	the	end	of	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">If	 the	 numbers	 are	 unequal,	 the	 melee	 rules	 for	 Little	 Wars	 obtain	 if	 the ground	is	level. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 the	 ground	 slopes,	 the	 cavalry	 charging	 downhill	 will	 be	 multiplied</p>
<p class="calibre1">according	 to	 the	 number	 of	 contours	 crossed.	 If	 it	 is	 one	 contour,	 it	 must	 be multiplied	by	two;	two	contours,	multiplied	by	three;	three	contours,	multiplied</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	four. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 cavalry	 retires	 before	 cavalry	 instead	 of	 accepting	 a	 charge,	 it	 must continue	to	retire	so	long	as	it	is	pursued—the	pursuers	can	only	be	arrested	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">fresh	cavalry	or	by	infantry	or	artillery	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 driven	 off	 the	 field	 or	 into	 an	 unfordable	 river,	 the	 retreating	 body	 is destroyed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 infantry	 find	 hostile	 cavalry	 within	 charging	 distance	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the enemy's	move,	and	this	infantry	retires	and	yet	is	still	within	charging	distance,	it will	receive	double	losses	if	in	extended	order	if	charged;	and	if	in	two	ranks	or in	 fours,	 will	 lose	 at	 three	 feet	 two	 men	 for	 each	 charging	 sabre;	 at	 two	 feet, three	men	for	each	charging	sabre.	The	cavalry	in	these	circumstances	will	lose</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing.	The	infantry	will	have	to	continue	to	retire	until	their	tormentors	have exterminated	them	or	been	driven	off	by	someone	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 cavalry	 charges	 artillery	 and	 is	 not	 dealt	 with	 by	 other	 forces,	 one	 gun	 is captured	with	a	loss	to	the	cavalry	of	four	men	per	gun	for	a	charge	at	three	feet, three	men	at	two	feet,	and	one	man	at	one	foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	artillery	retires	before	cavalry	when	cavalry	is	within	charging	distance,	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">must	continue	to	retire	so	long	as	the	cavalry	pursues. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 introduction	 of	 toy	 railway	 trains,	 moving,	 let	 us	 say,	 eight	 feet	 per move,	 upon	 toy	 rails,	 needs	 rules	 as	 to	 entraining	 and	 detraining	 and	 so	 forth, that	 will	 be	 quite	 easily	 worked	 out	 upon	 the	 model	 of	 boat	 embarkation	 here given.	 An	 engine	 or	 truck	 within	 the	 circle	 of	 destruction	 of	 a	 shell	 will	 be	 of course	destroyed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>The	toy	soldiers	used	in	this	Kriegspiel	should	not	be	the	large	soldiers	used in	Little	Wars.	The	British	manufacturers	who	turn	out	these	also	make	a	smaller, cheaper	type	of	man—the	infantry	about	an	inch	high—which	is	better	adapted</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	Kriegspiel	purposes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 hope,	 if	 these	 suggestions	 "catch	 on,"	 to	 induce	 them	 to	 manufacture	 a type	 of	 soldier	 more	 exactly	 suited	 to	 the	 needs	 of	 the	 game,	 including	 tray carriers	 for	 troops	 in	 formation	 and	 (what	 is	 at	 present	 not	 attainable) dismountable	cavalry	that	will	stand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 place	 this	 rough	 sketch	 of	 a	 Kriegspiel	 entirely	 at	 the	 disposal	 of	 any military	 men	 whose	 needs	 and	 opportunities	 enable	 them	 to	 work	 it	 out	 and make	it	into	an	exacter	and	more	realistic	game.	In	doing	so,	we	think	they	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">find	it	advisable	to	do	their	utmost	to	make	the	game	work	itself,	and	to	keep	the need	for	umpire's	decisions	at	a	minimum.	Whenever	possible,	death	should	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	actual	gun-	and	rifle-fire	and	not	by	computation.	Things	should	happen,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	be	decided.	We	would	also	like	to	insist	upon	the	absolute	need	of	an	official upon	 either	 side,	 simply	 to	 watch	 and	 measure	 the	 moves	 taken,	 and	 to	 collect and	check	the	amounts	of	supply	and	ammunition	given	up.	This	is	a	game	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">real	 war,	 played	 against	 time,	 and	 played	 under	 circumstances	 of	 considerable excitement,	 and	 it	 is	 remarkable	 how	 elastic	 the	 measurements	 of	 quite	 honest and	honourable	men	can	become. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	 believe	 that	 the	 nearer	 that	 Kriegspiel	 approaches	 to	 an	 actual	 small model	 of	 war,	 not	 only	 in	 its	 appearance	 but	 in	 its	 emotional	 and	 intellectual tests,	the	better	it	will	serve	its	purpose	of	trial	and	education. </p>
