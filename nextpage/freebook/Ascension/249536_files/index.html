<p class="calibre1">Ascension	 is	 a	 novella	 that	 takes	 place	 in	 the	 universe	 of	 the	 book	 series <i class="calibre4">Children	 of	 the	 Miracle, </i>	 winner	 of	 the	 2021	 IndieReader	 Discovery	 Award	 for Science	Fiction	Novel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 a	 dark	 future,	 humanity	 is	 at	 the	 brink	 of	 extinction	 after	 a	 global environmental	 catastrophe	 awakens	 a	 deadly	 virus,	 killing	 billions	 of	 humans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those	who	remain,	live	isolated	behind	the	walls	of	three	Sanctuary	cities	across the	 Earth:	 the	 Sanctuary	 of	 Europe,	 the	 Sanctuary	 of	 Americas,	 and	 the Sanctuary	of	Asia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 the	 FossilFlu	 virus	 reappears	 inside	 the	 Sanctuary	 of	 Asia's	 walls,	 the threat	of	another	pandemic	will	force	the	city's	governing	body	to	take	extreme measures	to	try	and	protect	the	last	of	human	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ascension	is	a	prequel	to	the	Children	of	the	Miracle	Series. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p6"></a>CHAPTER	ONE</p>
<p class="calibre1">LIZA	 FLINCHED	 as	 the	 needle	 pricked	 the	 inside	 of	 her	 left	 arm.	 Rose-coloured liquid	 raced	 up	 the	 tip	 of	 the	 tiny	 clear	 cylinder.	 The	 blood	 thickened,	 an instinctive	and	futile	effort	to	heal	its	stolen	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	 we	 go,”	 her	 nurse	 grinned	 an	 almost	 human	 smile	 as	 she	 pulled	 the syringe	away.	The	android	was	a	new	model	the	Government	introduced	as	part of	the	Ascension	Program.	Female	in	shape,	her	blue	unibody	construction	was seamlessly	 covered	 in	 a	 flexible	 rubber-like	 skin.	 She	 wore	 a	 grey	 nurse’s uniform	with	a	single	orange	flame	embroidered	on	her	right	chest	and	the	word Dignity	sewn	in	white	thread	below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Almost	done.	Isn’t	that	exciting?”	the	android	said,	pressing	a	sterile	patch of	cotton	against	the	pin-sized	dot	of	blood	on	Liza’s	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Exciting?”	 Liza	 murmured	 in	 disbelief,	 turning	 her	 anxious	 eyes	 to	 a message	board	hanging	on	the	wall	over	the	nurse’s	right	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 large	 digital	 display	 lit	 in	 luminescent	 colours	 was	 projecting	 a multidimensional	 looping	 video.	 A	 field	 of	 golden	 grasses	 swayed	 in	 a	 gentle breeze,	 surrounded	 by	 dark	 blue	 jagged	 mountains	 in	 the	 distance.	 Evening sunlight	 caressed	 the	 tips	 of	 the	 long	 thin	 stalks	 and	 haloed	 the	 flying	 insects hovering	over	the	grassy	landscape.	Scrolled	underneath	the	picture,	white	words in	a	black	box	read:	 <i class="calibre4">Duty	with	Dignity.	Let	us	help	you	help	others</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Placing	a	small	adhesive	bandage	over	the	cotton	patch,	the	nurse	turned	her back	to	Liza	and	marked	the	blood-filled	vial.	“That	is	all	now.	Please	wait	in	the lobby.	We	will	have	the	results…” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>Liza	stood,	peeled	her	sleeve	down	her	arm	before	the	android	could	finish, grabbed	her	purse,	and	walked	out	the	door.	The	hall	smelt	of	antiseptic.	Grubby streaks	left	by	heavy	traffic	lined	the	lower	part	of	the	otherwise	pristine	white painted	 walls.	 Her	 mind	 went	 fuzzy	 for	 a	 few	 seconds.	 Bright	 florescent	 lights overhead	dotted	her	glossy	eyes.	Suddenly,	the	corridor	felt	as	if	it	were	getting longer,	stretching	out	in	front	of	her.	She	tightened	her	grip	on	the	bag	clutched under	her	arm	and	quickened	her	step. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Almost	 skipping,	 she	 sped	 past	 the	 check-in	 counter	 as	 a	 young	 male receptionist	 stood.	 He	 said	 something.	 Waving	 his	 arm,	 he	 tried	 to	 get	 her attention.	 But	 she	 was	 off,	 racing	 through	 the	 packed	 waiting	 room.	 Worried eyes,	terrified	eyes,	wet	eyes—all	watched	her,	knowing	their	turn	was	soon	to come.	 Her	 throat	 closed	 in,	 holding	 back	 tears	 as	 she	 ran	 through	 the	 double glass	doors,	past	the	chanting	crowd	outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop	 the	 culling,”	 the	 protestors	 sang	 in	 repeated	 unison	 from	 behind chipped	and	worn	cement	barriers.	Her	eyes	avoided	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 fumbled	 in	 her	 purse	 while	 dodging	 through	 rows	 of	 vehicles.	 Having found	her	transport	key,	she	pressed	it	tightly	in	her	hand,	alerting	the	vehicle	of her	 speedy	 approach.	 Pulling	 on	 the	 handle,	 the	 hatch	 opened	 readily,	 and	 she jumped	 inside,	 quickly	 closing	 the	 door	 behind	 her.	 The	 demonstrators’	 voices softened.	Not	gone,	mind	you.	But	tolerable.	Like	a	fading	headache. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	floating	display	lit	up	over	her	dashboard	with	a	holographic	image	of	her transport	vehicle	glowing	green. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	 Liza,	 are	 we	 going	 home?”	 came	 the	 male	 voice	 of	 her	 virtual assistant	(SIVA)	from	the	vehicle	speakers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence	followed	his	query.	Liza	sat	still,	staring	forward,	unblinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	everything	okay?”	the	assistant	asked.	“Your	heart	rate	is	elevated.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	single	tear	slipped	out	of	the	corner	of	her	eye	and	washed	down	her	pallid cheek.	She	inhaled	deeply	and	let	out	a	long	jittery	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 shouting	 outside	 her	 car	 had	 stopped.	 The	 protestors	 stood	 around aimlessly,	 mingling	 as	 if	 discussing	 something	 as	 benign	 as	 the	 weather	 while waiting	 for	 their	 next	 target	 to	 enter	 or	 leave	 the	 clinic.	 She	 hated	 them.	 Their pointless	protests.	Where	were	they	when	Amendment	10	was	voted	through? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>As	 the	 minutes	 passed,	 her	 mind	 drifted	 into	 a	 cloudy	 numbness.	 She	 was like	a	bird	in	a	cage	looking	out	from	the	shell	of	her	body.	The	detached	feeling was	marked	by	a	blank	stare	forward	and	a	small	bead	of	spittle	gathering	in	the corner	of	her	open	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Ding</i>	 rang	 an	 alert	 on	 the	 vehicle	 display,	 giving	 her	 a	 start.	 She	 finally blinked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	have	an	incoming	message	from	Dignity,”	said	her	assistant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	 moved	 in	 the	 back	 of	 her	 mind.	 A	 memory	 came	 forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	 about	 a	 message	 –	 y <i class="calibre4">es,	 it	 all	 started	 with	 a	 message</i>.	 She	 had	 been watching	 one	 of	 her	 favourite	 archive	 videos—the	 one	 about	 the	 ancient	 rain forests.	 A	 time	 when	 animals	 roamed	 through	 lush	 undergrowth.	 When	 water poured	 over	 rock	 cliffs.	 When	 sunshine	 glimmered	 rather	 than	 burned.	 And trees,	 so	 many	 trees.  <i class="calibre4">That’s	 right. </i>	 She	 had	 been	 watching	 a	 video	 of	 the	 world before	 the	 Scorch,	 before	 the	 pandemic,	 before	 the	 damn	 message	 from	 the Government	interrupted	her	show. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">This	is	a	special	announcement	brought	to	you	by	the	Department	of</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Health	and	Security.	Amendment	10,	The	Extension	of	Eligibility	for</i> <i class="calibre4">Ascension,	has	passed	through	council	by	an	overwhelming	majority</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">today,	changing	the	age	requirements	for	testing.	Effective</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">immediately,	all	citizens	of	the	Sanctuary	of	Asia	forty	years	and</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">older	will	now	be	required	to	test	for	active	gene	immunity	to	the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">FossilFlu.	Citizens	with	negative	immunity	results	will	be	invited	to</i> <i class="calibre4">participate	in	the	Ascension	program	for	all	humanity's	health	and</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">security.	This	is	a	necessary	step	to	avoid	a	second	epidemic	and	an</i> <i class="calibre4">unnecessary	burden	on	our	health	facilities. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	 had	 to	 think	 about	 her	 age.  <i class="calibre4">I’m	 forty-one</i>,	 she	 reminded	 herself.	 “Am I…do	I	have	to…what	the…”	Her	face	drained	of	colour.  <i class="calibre4">How	in	the	hell	did	the</i> <i class="calibre4">Amendment	get	changed? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Amendment	 10	 was	 initially	 introduced	 to	 extend	 mandatory	 immunity testing	 from	 seventy-years	 of	 age	 and	 higher	 to	 sixty-years	 of	 age.	 The	 sudden</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>change	to	forty	made	no	sense.	Citizens	in	her	age	group	still	had	a	thirty	percent chance	 of	 positive	 immunity	 with	 repeated	 gene	 treatment.  <i class="calibre4">No,	 that	 can’t	 be</i> <i class="calibre4">right. </i>	She	must	have	misheard	the	message. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rewind	and	replay	announcement,”	she	commanded	her	virtual	assistant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	 leaned	 into	 the	 floating	 video	 display	 listening	 intently.	 There	 it	 was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	had	said,  <i class="calibre4">“…forty	years	of	age	or	older.” </i>	She	heard	it	right	the	first	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	hands	trembled.  <i class="calibre4">What	does	it	mean? </i>	Of	course,	she	knew	what	it	meant.	But asking	the	question	delayed	the	answer.	What	it	meant	was	–	she	would	have	to go	to	a	clinic	within	the	next	two	days	and	be	tested	for	immunity	resistance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse	 me,	 Liza,”	 interrupted	 her	 assistant	 from	 the	 dash	 of	 her	 vehicle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dignity	 requires	 notification	 that	 you	 have	 received	 and	 opened	 the	 message. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Would	you	like	to	listen	to	the	message	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	gave	her	head	a	little	shake	and	wiped	her	damp	chin	with	a	harsh	brush of	her	hand.	Giving	a	heavy,	uncertain	sigh,	she	said,	“Open	message.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	 Liza	 Lee.	 This	 is	 Dignity	 Services	 Limited.	 You	 have	 opted	 to receive	 treatment	 and	 medical	 information	 from	 our	 clinic	 through	 encrypted messaging	sent	directly	to	and	validated	by	your	virtual	assistant.	We	are	sending you	this	message	today	regarding	your	recent	visit	to	one	of	our	facilities.	Before we	go	any	further,	I	would	like	to	remind	you	that	Dignity	Service	Limited	is	a fully	authorized	affiliate	of	the	Sanctuary	Government	Ascension	Program.	You can	 access	 a	 copy	 of	 our	 full	 terms	 and	 conditions	 through	 your	 assistant	 who has	been	sent	the	file	log	with	this	message.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	voice	continued.	“Citizen	Lee,	we	thank	you	for	taking	your	mandatory FossilFlu	 virus	 susceptibility	 test	 with	 Dignity.	 We	 are	 sorry	 to	 report	 that activation	 of	 the	 immunity	 gene	 M4	 is	 negative.	 Your	 results	 have	 been	 filed with	 the	 Department	 of	 Health	 and	 Population.	 It	 is	 recommended	 within	 the governing	 guidelines,	 and	 for	 the	 benefit	 of	 humanity,	 you	 schedule	 an Ascension	 as	 soon	 as	 is	 convenient.	 Voluntary	 participation	 in	 the	 Dignity program	makes	you	eligible	for	the	Government’s	Friends	and	Family	Grant,	so you	can	rest	assured	those	you	are	leaving	behind	will	be	well	taken	care	of.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Voluntary?	Right,”	Liza	scoffed	bitterly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 understand	 this	 is	 a	 difficult	 time.	 We	 hope	 to	 make	 this	 transition	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>beautiful	 as	 possible.	 There	 are	 four	 packages	 you	 can	 choose	 from	 here	 at Dignity.	 The	 first	 option	 is	 fully	 funded	 by	 the	 Council	 of	 the	 Sanctuary.	 The next	three	packages	offer	a	menu	of	choices	for	your	going	away	ceremony	and final	 resting	 compliments.	 Please	 call	 us	 within	 the	 next	 twenty-four	 hours	 to schedule	 an	 appointment	 and	 discuss	 your	 Ascension.	 If	 we	 do	 not	 hear	 from you,	we	will	notify	the	Department	of	Health	that	you	have	neglected	to	respond. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	are	certain	we	can	help	you	leave	with	the	Dignity	you	deserve.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	voice	finished	to	a	profound	silence.	Liza’s	shoulders	slumped	forward as	her	chin	dropped	to	her	chest.	It	was	the	result	she	had	expected.	No	surprise there.	 Tests	 across	 the	 city	 were	 coming	 back	 with	 the	 same	 results—negative activation	 of	 the	 synthetic	 immunity	 gene.	 So	 high	 were	 the	 numbers	 that	 the public	had	become	sceptical	of	the	gene	cure.	Conspiracy	theorists	claimed	the entire	program	a	fake,	an	excuse	to	legitimize	the	Ascension	program. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	did	not	matter	either	way.	Fake	or	real,	the	program	was	supported	by	the politicians	 and	 backed	 by	 the	 public.	 And	 the	 rules	 were	 clear.	 Once	 you	 were tagged,	you	had	to	comply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	message	from	Dignity	repeated	in	her	head.	“Friends	and	Family	Grant,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	 whispered	 in	 disbelief.	 “Another	 bogus	 government	 program	 meant	 to make	us	feel	better.”  <i class="calibre4">Who	in	the	Sanctuary	had	real	family	anymore? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza,	 like	 many	 women,	 struggled	 to	 get	 pregnant.	 Years	 of	 intense	 solar radiation	 after	 the	 Scorch	 had	 reduced	 fertility	 in	 both	 men	 and	 women	 to frighteningly	 low	 numbers	 in	 the	 Sanctuary	 of	 Asia.	 So	 low	 was	 the	 birth	 rate that	 the	 Government	 was	 forced	 to	 approve	 a	 Population	 Assistance	 Program allowing	extracorporeal	pregnancy	by	growing	foetuses	outside	the	human	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	population	growth	was	the	least	of	the	Government’s	concerns	when	the FossilFlu	virus	returned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 victim,	 a	 fifty-year-old	 man	 living	 alone	 in	 Old	 Town,	 died	 within twenty-four	 hours	 of	 contracting	 the	 disease.	 Rats	 had	 brought	 the	 virus	 back into	 the	 heavily	 guarded	 city.	 Government	 action	 was	 swift.	 Hospitals	 went	 on alert.	 Entire	 buildings	 were	 converted	 to	 emergency	 medical	 facilities.	 Strict lockdowns	and	curfews	ground	the	Sanctuary	city	to	a	halt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tensions	rose,	and	soon	the	public	became	restless.	The	Government	had	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>show	progress	and	phase	one	was	a	mandatory	vaccination	scheme.	But	the	new synthetic	 immunity	 gene	 was	 rushed	 out	 under	 false	 hopes.	 When	 the	 older generations	displayed	negative	results	for	gene	activation,	doubt	in	the	program spread. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,	to	the	horror	of	the	public,	another	infection	was	reported.	Mass	panic ensued	 throughout	 the	 walled-in-city.	 Within	 days	 the	 leaders	 of	 the	 Sanctuary introduced	 the	 Ascension	 program.	 The	 highly	 controversial	 scheme	 aimed	 at removing	 the	 most	 vulnerable	 in	 society	 to	 ensure	 a	 repeat	 epidemic	 wouldn’t spread	 like	 wildfire	 through	 the	 gated	 city.	 The	 Sanctuary	 went	 silently	 into shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t	 it	 terrible?	 Asking	 people	 to	 kill	 themselves,”	 the	 citizens	 would	 say publicly	with	exaggerated	gasps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	did	it	come	to	this?”	others	would	answer,	offering	equally	bewildered expressions,	 all	 the	 time,	 knowing	 exactly	 how	 it	  <i class="calibre4">had	 come	 to	 this</i>	 because nobody	said	anything.	Their	lack	of	objection	was	an	agreement,	a	pact	with	the Sanctuary	leaders	to	allow	Ascension	to	pass.	That	is	how	it	happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over	time,	the	daily	death	tolls	became	a	standard	part	of	news	packets.  <i class="calibre4">“We</i> <i class="calibre4">honour	 and	 thank	 these	 dutiful	 citizens	 for	 their	 sacrifice	 to	 humanity, </i>”	 the announcer	 would	 start	 in	 a	 sincere	 voice.  <i class="calibre4">“Two	 hundred	 and	 thirty-one	 brave</i> <i class="calibre4">citizens	have	ascended	today.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Day	 after	 day,	 the	 numbers	 rolled	 out,	 faceless	 and	 nameless.	 Slowly,	 the counting	 of	 the	 dead	 became	 nothing	 more	 than	 noise	 in	 the	 background. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sanctuary	life	had	moved	on.	Until	Amendment	10. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	want	to	reply	to	Dignity?”	Liza’s	assistant	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	contemplated.	Several	times	she	started	to	respond	but	cut	herself	short. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	 in	 her	 belly	 was	 holding	 her	 back.	 Then,	 that	 something	 started rising,	becoming	a	lump	in	her	throat.	Her	face	twisted,	and	her	eye	swelled.	A tremor	shook	her	body	from	head	to	toe.	She	gripped	the	edge	of	the	dashboard with	 white	 knuckles	 and	 let	 out	 a	 long-trumpeted	 scream	 until	 her	 face	 turned purple.	 Inhaling	 deeply,	 she	 released	 another	 uncontrollable	 belting	 roar	 and sunk	into	herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	sudden	knock	on	her	glass	window	startled	her.	Turning	to	her	right,	she</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>found	 a	 young	 woman	 standing	 outside	 the	 vehicle	 wearing	 a	 pinched expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello?”	the	woman	said	in	a	semi-muted	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	 shook	 her	 head	 and	 flipped	 her	 hand,	 telling	 the	 stranger	 to	 go	 away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman,	no	older	than	twenty,	with	smooth	light	brown	skin,	piercing	blue eyes,	and	wearing	a	clear	face	mask,	refused	to	leave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please,	open	your	window.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	 straightened	 herself,	 pulled	 down	 on	 the	 edges	 of	 her	 white	 top,	 and ordered	her	window	to	open.	She	hated	herself	for	agreeing	to	talk	to	the	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	glass	purred	until	the	window	came	to	a	stop	halfway	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	okay?”	the	girl	asked	kindly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	I	look	okay,”	Liza	snapped,	her	voice	raspy	from	screaming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	 you	 just	 get	 your	 results?”	 the	 nosy	 girl	 pressed	 on.	 “It’s	 okay.	 You don’t	have	to	do	it.	We	are	here	to	help	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	are	 <i class="calibre4">we</i>,”	Liza	asked	bitterly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Us,”	she	pointed	to	the	group	of	sign-holders,	who	were	all	now	staring	at their	exchange.	“We	run	a	safe	home	for	those	who	wish	to	stay	alive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	really,”	Liza	spit	the	words.	“And	do	you	have	a	cure	as	well?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman’s	face	crinkled.	“I’m	trying	to	help	you.	Give	you	a	safe	place	to live	out	your	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	 knew	 what	 the	 woman	 was	 talking	 about.	 Shields,	 they	 called	 them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Buildings	for	vulnerable	citizens	who	were	shut	away	forever,	with	no	hope	of leaving.	 This	 was	 the	 only	 alternative	 to	 Ascension.	 Basically,	 a	 coffin	 of	 a different	kind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza’s	 voice	 became	 something	 even	 she	 didn’t	 recognize	 –	 hostile	 and aggressive.	“You	know	they	will	come	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	snapped	her	head	back.	“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	think	because	you	are	young	and	can	bear	children,	you	are	safe?	They won’t	 stop	 until	 every	 possible	 carrier	 of	 the	 disease	 is	 gone!	 That	 is	 all	 of	 us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every	last	human	in	this	godforsaken	Sanctuary.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	 not	 possible.	 Someone	 needs	 to	 live,”	 the	 woman	 replied,	 shaking her	head	as	if	the	thought	had	never	occurred	to	her	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a><img src="index-13_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	they?	Why?	For	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	you’re	in	shock.	Why	don’t	you	come	and	talk	to	us?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	 then,	 three	 people	 exited	 the	 clinic.	 A	 man	 around	 fifty-years-old, ghostly-white,	 was	 being	 escorted	 by	 two	 others.	 They	 rushed	 him	 past	 the jumping	signs	and	rhythmic	shouts	of	the	protestors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 woman	 standing	 outside	 Liza’s	 vehicle	 turned	 towards	 the	 commotion and	 squinted.	 A	 young	 male	 protester	 standing	 at	 the	 barrier’s	 edge	 was frantically	waving	his	hand,	capturing	her	attention.	With	a	determined	finger,	he pointed	at	the	terrified	patient,	now	making	his	way	through	the	parking	lot.	The gesture	was	an	explicit	instruction	to	move	on	from	the	old	woman	in	the	vehicle who	 was	 not	 interested	 in	 what	 they	 offered.	 The	 woman	 turned	 back	 and	 met Liza’s	eyes	one	last	time,	a	final	silent	offer	to	talk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go.	Just	get	out	of	here,”	Liza	said	and	ordered	the	window	to	rise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Running	 across	 the	 lot,	 the	 protestor	 approached	 the	 new	 patient.	 The	 old man’s	 two	 friends	 looked	 horrified	 at	 her	 approach.	 Anyone	 caught	 consorting with	 government	 protestors	 risked	 being	 flagged	 in	 the	 city’s	 Keeper	 policing system.	 Liza	 watched	 as	 the	 two	 strangers	 waved	 the	 approaching	 girl	 away violently	and	blocked	her	access	to	the	old	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 afternoon	 slipped	 by	 with	 no	 sense	 of	 time.	 Liza	 sat	 motionless	 in	 her vehicle,	 unable	 to	 think,	 move	 or	 act	 in	 any	 capacity.	 Staring	 out	 through	 half-closed	lids,	she	witnessed	the	incomprehensible	scenes	that	played	out	in	front	of her.	One	by	one,	the	patients	filed	out	of	the	clinic,	pale-faced	and	shell-shocked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	were	surrounded	by	the	friends	who	had	come	with	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Friends</i>.	The	thought	pulled	at	her.  <i class="calibre4">	When	was	the	last	time	I	talked	to	Henry? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Yesterday,	 that	 was	 right. </i>	 Henry	 had	 called	 just	 before	 the	 Government's announcement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 is	 unbelievable,”	 he	 had	 said.	 “The	 Amendment	 won’t	 pass.	 It	 can’t pass.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 choice	 does	 the	 government	 have,	 Henry,”	 she	 ironically	 argued	 on</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>behalf	of	Ascension.	“The	older	generation	are	the	most	vulnerable.	If	the	virus starts	 to	 spread	 through	 the	 city	 again,	 they	 will	 fill	 the	 isolation	 wards.	 After that,	the	disease	will	be	out	of	control.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 always	 have	 a	 choice,	 Liza.	 Where	 does	 it	 all	 end	 and	 when?”	 The miniature	3D	holograph	of	Henry	shook	his	head	in	anguish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	exactly	what	they	are	trying	to	avoid.	Having	it	all	end.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later	that	day,	when	the	Amendment	was	announced,	including	the	updated age	for	eligibility,	Henry	immediately	called	back.	Liza	did	not	answer.	She	did not	dare.	That	would	mean	the	broadcast	was	real.	Her	assistant	played	Henry’s message	live	as	it	was	being	recorded	before	she	could	stop	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Liza,	 please	 pick	 up.	 Oh	 my,	 this	 can’t	 be,”	 he	 kept	 repeating,	 sounding more	 and	 more	 exasperated.	 “I	 didn’t	 see	 that	 coming.	 Forty-year-olds?	 How could	 they	 do	 that	 without	 consultation?	 Please,	 Liza,	 pick	 up.”	 There	 was	 a slight	 pause.	 “I	 am	 coming	 over,”	 he	 said	 with	 conviction.	 “You’re	 not	 alone, Liza.	I’m	here	for	you,	and	I’m	coming	over.	Oh	my,”	he	exclaimed	and	ended the	message. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Good	old	Henry.	Lucky	Henry.	He	was	thirty-nine	years	old.	One	extra	year to	live.	Maybe	they	would	find	a	cure	by	then.	That	was	highly	unlikely.	It	had been	thirty	years	since	the	global	pandemic,	and	still,	they	had	nothing	that	could stop	 the	 FossilFlu.	 But	 maybe	 for	 Henry,	 it	 would	 be	 different.	 After	 all, discovery	 can	 happen	 in	 a	 moment.	 Then	 again,	 so	 could	 death.	 Her	 death happened	 in	 a	 moment.	 One	 second,	 she	 was	 watching	 the	 broadcast,	 then	 the next,	she	was	dead.	Well,	as	good	as. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Call	Henry</i>.	 She	 made	 a	 mental	 note	 while	 the	 last	 of	 the	 protestors	 drifted away	and	the	evening	set	in.	The	parking	lot	cleared.	Liza	could	not	bring	herself to	move.	As	night	fell,	a	hovering	display	in	laser	lights	blinked	on,	covering	the front	 of	 the	 now-closed	 clinic.  <i class="calibre4">Duty	 with	 Dignity</i>,	 it	 read.	 Images	 played	 of smiling	 people,	 laughing	 people,	 holding	 hands,	 and	 walking	 into	 a	 soft	 white light	 where	 they	 disappeared	 poetically.	 The	 reality	 was	 more	 like	 screaming people,	wide-eyed,	terrified	people,	wet-eyed,	sad	people,	getting	pushed	into	a coffin.	“Nothing	happy	about	that,  <i class="calibre4">” </i>	she	muttered	angrily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	full	day	of	indecision	and	denial	was	exhausting.	Liza’s	brain	shut	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a><img src="index-15_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">She	let	out	a	long	yawn,	and	her	lids	grew	heavy.	Sleep	consumed	her,	no	matter how	much	she	fought	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rain	pellets	thumped	against	the	vehicle	roof.	Liza	stirred,	slowly	waking.	Her car	seat	was	laid	back	and	stretched	out	into	an	uncomfortable	cot.	She	sat	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	time	is	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Six	in	the	morning,”	answered	her	assistant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	 combed	 her	 fingers	 through	 her	 thick	 jet-black	 hair,	 pulling	 the	 shiny locks	 away	 from	 her	 face.	 Stretching,	 a	 painful	 crick	 pinged	 in	 her	 neck	 after lying	 in	 an	 awkward	 position	 all	 night.	 A	 memory	 of	 a	 dream	 she	 was	 having faded.	 Something	 about	 her	 apartment:	 she	 was	 anxious	 about	 cleaning	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Getting	 it	 tidy.	 But	 no	 matter	 how	 hard	 she	 tried,	 she	 kept	 finding	 bits	 out	 of place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 stomach	 growled.	 She	 briefly	 thought	 about	 ordering	 tea	 and	 biscuits from	 one	 of	 the	 bot-driven	 drone	 services	 that	 roamed	 the	 city	 streets.	 Then	 a strange	 realization	 hit	 her.	 “What’s	 the	 point	 of	 eating	 anymore,”	 she	 said	 out loud,	 followed	 by	 a	 mystified	 laugh.	 Slowly,	 her	 perplexed	 expression	 twisted into	 a	 red-cheeked	 rage.  <i class="calibre4">Idiots.	 They	 are	 all	 idiots</i>,	 she	 screamed	 in	 her	 mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Pretending	 life	 was	 normal	 –	 no,	 not	 just	 normal,	 but	 getting	 better!	 Lies</i>.	 Her anger	grew.	The	Sanctuary	was	not	a	city.	It	was	a	grave.	A	living	gravesite	for the	last	humans	on	Earth,	waiting	to	die—an	epitaph	to	civilization.  <i class="calibre4">Why	would	I</i> <i class="calibre4">want	 to	 stick	 around	 anyways?	 For	 what? </i>	she	argued	with	herself.  <i class="calibre4">Maybe	 it	 is</i> <i class="calibre4">better	to	be	off	now	than	suffer	another	horrible	epidemic. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">At	this	very	moment,	the	first	time	she	admitted	to	herself	that	her	death	was imminent,	 her	 life	 flashed	 before	 her.	 Images	 raced	 past	 her	 mind’s	 eye	 like	 a whirling	carousel.	Colours,	smells,	and	sounds	profoundly	and	vividly	stirred	her senses	 as	 if	 they	 had	 only	 happened	 moments	 ago.	 Further	 and	 further backwards,	 she	 spun	 dizzily,	 witnessing	 her	 life	 in	 reverse.	 Until,	 like	 a	 shank stuck	in	a	moving	wheel,	the	flashbacks	were	brought	to	an	abrupt	halt	by	one memory	in	particular. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>Liza	was	nine.	Her	parents	were	already	dead,	having	caught	the	virus	in	the first	 wave.	 A	 fact	 that	 likely	 saved	 her	 life.	 Put	 in	 government	 care,	 she	 was already	an	institutionalized	part	of	the	Sanctuary	before	they	turned	people	away and	ultimately	closed	the	city	gates	forever.	She	lived	in	the	Dormitory	with	the other	 orphans	 of	 the	 pandemic.	 It	 was	 morning.	 Blue-skinned	 nannybots	 were busy	waking	the	children	and	escorting	them	down	to	the	cantina	for	breakfast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	 was	 tall	 for	 a	 nine-year-old	 and	 was	 put	 in	 a	 room	 with	 three	 older	 girls around	 twelve	 and	 thirteen.	 Kosu,	 a	 nervous	 girl,	 thin	 of	 frame	 and	 with	 a languid	disposition,	slept	in	the	bed	next	to	Liza. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kosu?”	Liza	tapped	her	friend’s	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	girl	lay	still	under	her	sheets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nanny	will	be	here	soon.	We	need	to	get	ready,”	Liza	continued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why,”	 Kosu	 quietly	 replied,	 refusing	 to	 break	 her	 hypnotized	 stare	 into space. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza’s	face	crinkled.	“It’s	breakfast	time,”	she	offered	factually.	“We	always go	down	to	breakfast	now.”	Her	voice	went	up	on	the	end	as	if	both	a	statement and	question	at	once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 drop	 of	 water	 slipped	 out	 of	 the	 corner	 of	 Kosu’s	 eye	 and	 slid	 sideways down	her	indifferent	face.	“Just	go	without	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	remained	silently	watching	her	friend,	unsure	what	to	do	or	say.	Kosu’s eyes	suddenly	came	to	life,	grew	wide,	and	her	brow	stitched	together	in	anger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	said,	go!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 unexpected	 outburst	 gave	 Liza	 a	 start	 and	 had	 the	 opposite	 effect desired.	Now	she	was	scared	and	unable	to	move,	even	if	she	wanted	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kosu	bolted	upright.	“You	always	do	what	you	are	supposed	to.	Don't	you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	screamed	in	Liza's	face	and	stormed	off	to	the	toilet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	stood	waiting	for	what	seemed	like	an	eternity	in	her	memory.	But	Kosu would	never	come	out	of	the	washroom	that	morning.	When	Liza	returned	from breakfast,	Kosu’s	bed	had	been	changed.	Dressed	in	fresh	sheets	and	a	pillow,	it was	as	if	nobody	had	ever	slept	in	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	afternoon,	during	Liza’s	daily	viral	scan,	she	asked	the	male	nurse	about Kosu.	 He	 shook	 his	 head,	 making	 a	  <i class="calibre4">tsk,	 tsk</i>	 noise	 with	 his	 tongue	 against	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>back	of	his	teeth	and	said,	“It’s	probably	for	the	better.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 was	 not	 the	 memory	 she	 would	 have	 hoped	 for	 at	 the	 end	 of	 her	 life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	it	was	understandable,	for	it	was	prophetic.  <i class="calibre4">	</i> The	words: <i class="calibre4">	“You	always	do	what</i> <i class="calibre4">you’re	 supposed	 to” </i> and <i class="calibre4">	 “It’s	 probably	 for	 the	 better” </i> rang	 like	 bells	 in	 her head <i class="calibre4">. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don’t	 want	 to	 die,”	 Liza	 suddenly	 confessed	 in	 a	 barely	 audible	 voice, sitting	 in	 her	 vehicle	 alone.	 The	 truth	 overwhelmed	 and	 seized	 her	 with	 a convulsive	 shiver	 down	 her	 spine.	 “Please.	 I	 don’t	 want	 to	 die,”	 she	 repeated louder,	 almost	 screaming	 at	 the	 Dignity	 nurse	 in	 her	 mind.	 Her	 eyelids	 welled up,	 and	 streams	 of	 tears	 slid	 down	 her	 cheeks	 as	 she	 began	 an	 uncontrollable sob. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside	 Liza’s	 vehicle,	 the	 first	 of	 the	 protestors	 returned	 and	 assembled	 at the	clinic	entrance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 a	 few	 long	 minutes,	 when	 her	 tears	 were	 spent	 and	 her	 body	 was	 no longer	 able	 to	 hold	 itself	 up,	 she	 fell	 back	 into	 her	 seat.	 She	 thought	 of	 Henry again.	His	tender	and	heartfelt	kisses.	His	deep	voice	soothing.  <i class="calibre4">Had	they	already</i> <i class="calibre4">contacted	 you,	 sweet	 Henry? </i>	  <i class="calibre4">Had	 they	 already	 restricted	 your	 movements	 just</i> <i class="calibre4">for	being	my	friend? </i>	It	was	highly	likely.	The	Government	wasted	no	time	when a	 citizen	 was	 tagged	 for	 Ascension.	 Their	 family	 and	 friends,	 and	 sometimes, neighbours,	 were	 notified	 and	 placed	 under	 strict	 lockdown	 until	 the	 ascension ceremony <i class="calibre4">. </i> Entire	neighbourhoods	had	turned	on	those	who	refused	to	ascend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poor	Henry.	He	would	be	waiting	for	her.	She	could	hear	him	now.	He	would tell	her	everything	would	be	okay.	Tell	her	he	didn't	mind	being	in	lockdown	if they	were	together.	No,	she	could	not	do	that	to	Henry.	He	had	his	own	future	to worry	about	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	stared	at	the	clinic	doors.	Unknowingly,	she	had	pulled	her	fingers	into tight	 fists	 pressing	 hard	 into	 her	 lap.	 She	 loosened	 her	 hands.	 Shook	 them	 out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Took	a	long	deep	breath,	followed	by	a	slow	controlled	release.  <i class="calibre4">I	can	do	this.	I</i> <i class="calibre4">have	to	do	this	for	Henry. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 time	 does	 the	 clinic	 open?”	 she	 asked	 in	 a	 voice	 so	 resigned,	 so contained,	a	stranger	might	think	she	was	simply	scheduling	a	check-up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Dignity	clinic	is	open	now,”	her	assistant	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>“Tell	them	I’m	on	my	way	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>CHAPTER	TWO</p>
<p class="calibre1">HENRY	 FORD	 SAT	 in	 his	 apartment	 and	 listened	 to	 the	 news	 feed	 with	 wide, terrified	eyes.	His	heart	stopped.	Or	sped	up.	He	was	so	disoriented	he	couldn’t tell.	 An	 image	 of	 Liza,	 her	 large	 dark	 brown	 eyes,	 hair	 so	 black	 it	 was	 almost blue,	 and	 her	 beguiling	 smile	 came	 into	 his	 mind	 instantly	 as	 the	 broadcaster announced	 the	 sudden	 and	 unexpected	 change	 in	 age	 qualification	 for	 those required	 to	 test	 for	 immunity	 resistance	 to	 the	 virus.	 Something	 from	 his stomach	rose	up	into	his	throat,	and	a	sour	sick	taste	filled	his	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Call	 Liza,”	 he	 bleated	 into	 the	 air,	 jumping	 to	 his	 feet	 and	 starting	 a	 rapid pace	back	and	forth	in	his	living	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Liza	is	not	answering	the	call,”	his	virtual	assistant	calmly	responded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Leave	a	message:	Liza,	pick	up.	Please.	Oh	my,	I	didn’t	see	that	coming…</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m	coming	over.	End	Message.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	 grabbed	 a	 long	 overcoat	 hanging	 by	 the	 door	 and	 slipped	 out	 of	 his building	 onto	 the	 Old	 Town's	 twisted	 cobblestone	 streets.	 Flipping	 his	 hood	 up over	his	permanently	coiffed	burnt-orange	hair,	the	tick,	tick,	tick	of	rain	falling onto	his	polyurethane	rubber	coat	echoed	around	his	ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zoom!	Beep,	beep!	Hover	crafts	descended	and	rose	busily	into	the	narrow passages	between	the	shop	fronts	and	bustling	crowds	of	citizens	in	usual	daily business.	 Old	 Town	 was	 at	 the	 heart	 of	 the	 Sanctuary.	 Its	 twisting	 mid-evil pathways	were	the	arteries	where	history,	culture	and	remembrance	were	carved into	the	cold,	sterile	world	of	glass	and	steel	skyscrapers	that	made	up	the	much larger	 walled	 city.	 Before	 the	 Scorch,	 before	 FossilFlu,	 Old	 Town	 was	 nearly</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>abandoned.	It	was	only	a	dot	on	a	tourist	map	for	those	visiting	the	largest	and most	 advanced	 metropolis	 on	 the	 Asian	 continent.	 When	 the	 pandemic	 hit	 and the	disease	could	not	be	contained,	the	Sanctuary	of	Asia	was	forced	to	build	a 140-foot	 barrier	 wall	 around	 its	 borders	 and	 close	 its	 citizen’s	 inside	 while billions	 outside	 were	 dying.	 The	 throngs	 of	 desperate	 humans	 who	 were	 lucky enough	 to	 have	 gotten	 through	 the	 gates	 before	 they	 closed	 were	 distributed around	 the	 city	 and	 assigned	 living	 quarters.	 Old	 Town,	 once	 again,	 became	 a living	 community.	 Henry	 and	 Liza	 had	 grown	 up	 as	 orphans	 in	 these	 crooked streets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Theirs	 was	 not	 an	 immediate	 affection	 for	 each	 other.	 Well,	 not	 for	 Liza anyways.	Henry	was	a	quiet	man.	It	wasn’t	that	he	didn’t	have	his	own	thoughts, no	Henry	had	plenty	of	ideas.	Great	ideas	at	that!	It	was	just	that	Henry	also	had a	stutter,	which	he	developed	in	childhood	after	witnessing	the	agonizing	death of	 both	 his	 parents	 and	 a	 sister	 to	 the	 FossilFlu.	 To	 avoid	 embarrassment,	 he preferred	 instead	 to	 keep	 his	 ideas	 to	 himself.	 And	 so,	 day	 after	 day,	 he	 would open	the	small	door	cut	into	the	heart	of	a	larger	door	at	the	front	of	his	tea	shop, stand	 behind	 the	 old	 wood	 counter	 quietly,	 and	 wait	 for	 Liza	 to	 come	 in.	 Like clockwork,	 at	 nine,	 she	 would	 walk	 through	 his	 door	 for	 a	 fresh	 cup	 of	 his unique	home-brewed	tea.	Henry’s	heart	would	speed	up,	his	cheeks	would	turn red,	but	all	he	could	ever	muster	was	a	thin	nervous	smile,	and	if	lucky,	without pause	or	repetition,	a	clear	“Good	morning”	and	“The	usual?”	at	seeing	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 had	 convinced	 himself	 she	 felt	 the	 same	 for	 him	 long	 before	 she	 had spoken	the	words.	His	conviction	was	because	she	returned	each	morning	to	his tea	 shop	 when	 she	 hadn’t	 needed	 to,	 as	 food	 and	 drink	 replicators	 offered	 a multitude	 of	 tea	 simulants.	 Of	 course,	 there	 was	 always	 the	 possibility	 she	 just couldn’t	live	without	his	home-grown	Camellia	Sinesis.	His	was	the	real	thing, not	 picoparticle	 derived	 replications.	 But	 acknowledging	 this	 alternative	 truth would	only	break	his	heart	and	keep	him	up	in	the	long	hours	of	the	night	pining for	unrequited	love.	No,	it	was	much	easier	to	believe	she	was	shy,	in	love,	and didn’t	yet	know	how	to	express	herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	one	day,	no	different	than	any	other,	in	a	moment	Henry	would	never forget,	Liza	stayed	longer	than	usual.	She	lingered	with	tea	in	hand	and	browsed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>with	 her	 eyes	 at	 the	 many	 glass	 jars	 in	 various	 sizes	 that	 stocked	 the	 shelves behind	 Henry	 and	 his	 counter.	 The	 containers	 were	 filled	 with	 dry	 leaves	 in different	shades	of	blacks	to	reds	to	greens	to	whites. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 always	 get	 the	 same	 tea,”	 she	 pondered	 out	 loud,	 her	 eyes	 pointing	 over his	shoulders.	“What’s	in	the	other	jars?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	 felt	 his	 muscles	 go	 rigid	 and	 a	 few	 beads	 of	 sweat	 form	 under	 his hairline.	He	wanted	to	tell	her	everything	he	knew	about	tea.	Just	let	the	words spill	out	and	keep	her	standing	in	his	shop	for	hours.	But	his	tongue	had	grown thick	and	dry,	and	a	slight	spasm	in	both	corners	of	his	mouth	were	familiar	tells that	speaking	would	reveal	the	percussions	of	his	disability. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza’s	 eyes	 drifted	 to	 his	 face.	 Her	 pinched	 brow	 gave	 way	 she	 saw	 his discomfort,	and	to	Henry’s	horror,	she	misread	his	intentions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	so	sorry.	I’m	taking	up	too	much	of	your	time,”	she	quickly	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Na…na…na…nooo,”	Henry	forced	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza’s	 cheeks	 burned	 red,	 having	 forced	 Henry	 into	 an	 embarrassing situation.	 But	 instead	 of	 excusing	 herself	 and	 leaving,	 she	 stayed.	 Tilting	 her head,	she	offered	a	friendly	smile	and	waited,	quietly	and	patiently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	 took	 a	 deep	 breath	 and	 started	 slowly.	 “The	 di…di…difference	 is	 in the	fermentation.	They	are	all	the	sa…sa…same	tea	plant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza’s	 eyes,	 kind	 eyes,	 understanding	 eyes,	 remained	 locked	 onto	 his,	 and she	 nodded	 politely	 as	 he	 continued	 to	 explain	 how	 the	 darker,	 redder	 leaves were	 fermented	 longer.	 The	 tea	 she,	 in	 particular,	 enjoyed	 was	 a	 lighter,	 green tea,	requiring	less	fermentation.	As	his	mouth	moved	more	fluidly	and	his	voice grew	more	confident,	the	singing	in	Henry’s	heart	drowned	out	his	fear.	A	heavy stone	 had	 been	 lifted	 off	 his	 shoulders,	 and	 his	 words	 became	 feather-light, floating	out	of	his	mouth	without	resistance	for	the	first	time	in	his	remembered life.	 For	 Henry,	 it	 was	 a	 miracle.	 For	 Liza,	 it	 was	 the	 beginning	 of	 their friendship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within	 weeks	 their	 conversations	 had	 grown	 longer.	 They	 shared	 tea,	 then lunch,	 then	 dinner	 and	 eventually	 their	 beds.	 Henry’s	 stammer	 had	 all	 but disappeared	 when	 around	 Liza.	 This	 he	 took	 as	 proof	 they	 were	 meant	 to	 be together	 forever.	 He	 was	 planning	 on	 asking	 her	 to	 move	 in	 until	 the	 damn</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>Amendment	10.	Oh,	dear,	dear,	Liza,	he	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry’s	 face	 washed	 pale	 as	 that	 horrible	 sick	 feeling	 in	 his	 stomach returned,	 thinking	 about	 Liza	 Ascending.	 His	 pace	 quickened	 through	 the crumbling	neighbourhood.	Liza’s	apartment	was	in	a	skyrise	several	city-blocks outside	 of	 Old	 Town.	 He	 could	 get	 to	 her	 building	 in	 forty	 minutes	 and	 thirty-two	 seconds	 at	 an	 average	 pace	 on	 foot.	 Today,	 he	 was	 hoping	 to	 make	 the journey	in	less	time.	There	was	no	point	hailing	a	hover	cab.	City	restrictions	on vehicles	 to	 conserve	 energy	 meant	 cabs	 were	 far	 too	 expensive	 for	 such	 short trips,	and	it	would	be	rerouted	to	service	longer	requests	even	if	he	tried	to	find one.	No,	this	morning,	he	would	have	to	be	quick	on	his	feet.	And	the	heavy	rain and	busy	walkways	would	not	make	it	any	easier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	dodged,	swiped	sideways,	and	skipped	on	and	off	the	black	mirrored streets	 as	 he	 sped	 down	 the	 city	 blocks	 and	 weaved	 through	 the	 pedestrians dressed	 in	 their	 long	 polyurethan	 capes	 and	 transparent	 face	 masks.  <i class="calibre4">There	 is	 a</i> <i class="calibre4">pending	 pandemic,	 people! </i>	 He	 wanted	 to	 scream	 at	 them.  <i class="calibre4">What	 are	 you	 doing</i> <i class="calibre4">out	here?	Go	home	and	get	out	of	my	way! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">His	growing	frustration	and	rage	incited	a	sudden	hatred	for	everyone	around him.	 They	 were	 the	 problem:	 citizens	 who	 had	 grown	 tired	 of	 being	 locked inside	 their	 homes	 and	 refused	 to	 sacrifice	 their	 ‘freedom’	 to	 save	 the	 most vulnerable.	They	were	the	reason	Liza	was	called	to	the	clinic,	called	to	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">How	 selfish	 you	 all	 are!	 How	 grotesquely	 inhumane	 the	 last	 of	 humanity	 has</i> <i class="calibre4">become! </i>	He	screamed	in	his	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	glanced	down	at	the	time	displayed	on	the	communicator	band	he	wore</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	 his	 left	 wrist.	 Twenty	 minutes	 had	 passed.	 So	 much	 for	 hurrying,	 he scolded	himself.	He	would	need	to	be	more	aggressive.	Jumping	in	front	of	a	tall and	 broad-shouldered	 man,	 his	 booted	 foot	 sent	 water	 splashing	 up	 on	 the stranger’s	trousers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey!	Be	careful,	you	idiot!	And	where	the	hell	is	your	mask!”	the	tall	man bellowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Usually,	 Henry	 would	 have	 turned	 back	 and	 profusely	 apologized.	 But	 not today. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Oh,	just	shut	up!	You	have	no	idea	what	is	at	stake.	You	think	getting	a	little</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a> <i class="calibre4">water	 on	 your	 trousers	 is	 the	 worst	 thing	 that	 can	 happen.	 Try	 losing	 your</i> <i class="calibre4">partner.	How	would	that	feel? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">These	 thoughts	 only	 ran	 through	 Henry’s	 mind	 and	 never	 became	 words spoken.	Instead,	the	worst	retort	that	Henry	could	muster	was	a	“Sorry”	over	his shoulder	without	turning	to	give	the	man	the	courtesy	of	a	face-to-face	apology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 Henry	 rounded	 the	 final	 corner	 and	 had	 Liza’s	 building	 in	 his	 sites,	 he lifted	his	wrist	and	spoke	into	his	bracelet,	“Call	Liza.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	is	no	answer.	Would	you	like	to	leave	a	message?”	Henry's	assistant said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	 did	 want	 to	 leave	 a	 message.	 Many	 messages,	 in	 fact.	 He	 loved	 her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 couldn’t	 live	 without	 her.	 He	 would	 find	 a	 way	 to	 protect	 her	 from	 the Ascension.	 But	 he	 knew	 there	 was	 a	 good	 chance	 Liza	 had	 left	 for	 the	 clinic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	was	not	one	to	procrastinate.	Things	seemed	to	eat	at	her	if	unfinished.	Her apartment	 was	 always	 tidy	 and	 in	 order.	 Her	 appearances	 set	 the	 standard	 for primmed	and	punctual.	And	she	never,	not	once	in	the	time	he	had	known	her, missed	an	appointment.	He	could	only	hope	this	would	be	the	first	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Breathing	 heavily	 and	 nearly	 doubled	 over	 with	 an	 ache	 in	 his	 side,	 Henry yanked	the	hood	off	of	his	head	to	present	his	face	to	the	security	panel	outside the	 entrance	 of	 Liza’s	 building.	 “Liza	 Lee,”	 he	 cried	 into	 the	 black	 glass	 panel embedded	in	the	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza’s	 virtual	 assistant,	 having	 recognized	 Henry’s	 face	 and	 voice, responded,	 “Liza	 is	 not	 home,	 Henry.	 She	 told	 me	 to	 tell	 you	 she	 will	 call	 you later.	I’m	sorry	to	have	to	share	this	news	with	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	felt	the	wind	squeezed	out	of	his	lungs.  <i class="calibre4">Why?	Why	is	she	cutting	me</i> <i class="calibre4">out	now? </i>	Throwing	his	back	against	the	building	wall,	he	slumped	down,	knees bent,	and	dropped	his	face	into	his	lap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	wait,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Henry,	 it	 is	 not	 advisable	 that	 you	 wait	 outside	 her	 building.	 Your whereabouts	 will	 likely	 be	 monitored	 and	 restricted	 now	 that	 Liza	 has	 been called	 to	 test	 for	 Ascension.	 That	 is	 the	 government	 protocol	 for	 friends	 and family	until	Ascension	is	complete.	If	you	stay	outside,	you	could	be	picked	up by	the	Keepers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a><img src="index-24_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fa…fa…fa…FUCK	THE	KEEPERS!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very	 well.	 I	 will	 leave	 you	 now.	 Let	 me	 know	 if	 I	 can	 help	 you	 with anything	further.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	laid	his	face	on	down,	cheek	to	knee,	and	began	the	long	wait. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	blinked	himself	awake,	unaware	he	had	even	fallen	asleep.	Something	of dawn	 was	 breaking	 through	 a	 heavy	 mist.	 Sunrise	 was	 always	 a	 slow	 and	 dim event	 under	 the	 clouded	 protection	 of	 the	 Sanctuary’s	 artificial	 biosphere.	 The permanent	pall	over	the	city	perpetually	blocked	out	the	scorching	sun,	recycling the	 rarest	 of	 Earth’s	 gifts,	 freshwater.	 Henry’s	 head	 was	 soaked	 and	 covered	 in beads	of	dripping	rain.	His	thick	orange	hair,	reminiscent	of	a	lion’s	mane	with	a heart-shaped	hairline	when	dry,	lay	flat	on	his	head	and	darkened	to	something near	a	deep	reddish-brown.	The	moist	flesh	of	his	cheeks	hid	his	tears,	so	he	was only	aware	of	them	once	they	tickled	the	edges	of	his	nostrils	and	top	lip.  <i class="calibre4">How</i> <i class="calibre4">long	have	I	been	asleep? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 dreams	 were	 heavy	 on	 his	 heart,	 but	 the	 images	 had	 all	 but	 faded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	of	his	mother,	was	it…or	his	sister?	Either	way,	he	knew	this	feeling all	too	well.	It	was	the	scar	of	grief	and	abandonment	cut	into	his	brain	after	all of	his	known	family	had	died.	Now	Liza	was	next.	How	unfair	the	world	was	to Henry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 lifted	 his	 left	 arm	 and	 glanced	 at	 the	 time	 display	 on	 his	 wrist	 band.	 It was	 six	 in	 the	 morning.	 He	 pulled	 himself	 up	 to	 standing	 by	 pressing	 his	 back against	the	wall	and	crawling	upward	with	stiff	legs.	Cupping	a	handful	of	wet hair,	he	pulled	his	saggy	bangs	back	away	from	his	forehead	and	leaned	into	the digital	panel	at	the	entrance	of	Liza’s	building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Liza	Lee.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	Henry,”	came	the	disappointing	assistant’s	voice.	“Liza	is	not	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	you	know	that.	You	have	been	sitting	outside	all	night.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	he	replied	despondently.	“I	thought	maybe,	while	I	was	asleep	or…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Liza	wants	you	to	know	she	is	safe	and	will	talk	to	you	soon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>“Does	she	know	I	am	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	did	not	ask	me	about	your	location.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	is	she?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can’t	say.	Not	without	Liza's	permission.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	is	at	a	clinic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	an	artificial	silence	from	the	assistant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	her	I	will	not	leave	until	she	comes	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	will	send	the	message.	Is	there	anything	else	I	can	help	you	with?	Would you	like	me	to	order	a	coffee	or	tea	from	the	delivery	drones	for	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.	Just	send	her	the	message,	now,	please.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	waited	against	the	building.	He	found	it	odd	nobody	had	come	in	or gone	 out	 the	 entire	 time	 he	 had	 been	 holding	 his	 semi-vigilant	 watch.  <i class="calibre4">Had	 the</i> <i class="calibre4">whole	 building	 been	 put	 into	 lockdown? </i>	 His	 mind	 wandered	 through	 the residents	he	had	come	across	in	the	halls	and	the	lift	since	meeting	Liza.	Many were	 young	 and	 below	 the	 new	 threshold	 for	 Ascension.	 And	 anyways,	 he wasn’t	aware	of	the	Government	locking	down	an	entire	building	in	the	past.	But he	 didn’t	 expect	 the	 government	 to	 bring	 the	 threshold	 for	 testing	 immunity resistance	down	to	forty	years	of	age	either.  <i class="calibre4">Fuck	the	Government. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 Sanctuary’s	 Government,	 once	 run	 by	 the	 people,	 for	 the	 people,	 had become	increasingly	secret.	He	didn’t	like	it.	Not	one	bit.	But	what	could	he	do? </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 had	 their	 unsanctioned	 police	 force	 called	 the	 Keepers.	 The	 new department	 was	 run	 by	 military-trained	 professionals	 and	 armed	 with	 the	 only weapon	 in	 the	 city:	 a	 new	 android	 regiment	 also	 called	 the	 Keepers.	 The terrifying	 humanoids,	 with	 silver-white	 hair,	 and	 metallic	 skinned	 bodies,	 had super-human	 strength	 and	 enough	 AI	 wits	 to	 adapt	 in	 real-time.	 No	 person, indeed,	not	one	of	ordinary	means	and	usual	physical	disposition	like	Henry,	was a	 match	 for	 the	 Keeper’s	 androids.	 The	 new	 creatures	 had	 marched	 out	 of	 the Government’s	cryptic	Oasis	labs,	a	complete	surprise	to	the	public,	and	patrolled the	city,	‘protecting’	citizens	by	enforcing	the	ever-changing	pandemic	rules. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	 suddenly	 felt	 the	 eye	 of	 the	 city	 on	 him.	 Liza’s	 assistant	 could	 be right.	 It	 was	 dangerous	 for	 him	 to	 be	 outside	 without	 permission	 because	 he knew	 her.	 Getting	 caught	 now	 and	 forced	 into	 a	 penial	 lockdown	 would	 make</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>seeing	Liza	impossible.	Henry’s	heartbeat	raced.  <i class="calibre4">I’ve	got	to	get	out	of	the	open! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I’ve	already	been	out	here	too	long. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Peeking	around	the	corner	of	the	building’s	entrance,	he	looked	cautiously	up and	 down	 the	 street.	 Pale	 morning	 sunlight	 bled	 through	 the	 misty	 skyline, thinning	 but	 never	 entirely	 erasing	 the	 bright	 multidimensional	 holographic billboards	 that	 decorated	 the	 building	 fronts.	 Already,	 people	 were	 spilling	 out into	the	city	roads.	Hovercrafts	zipped	up,	down	and	back	and	forth	with	greater frequency.	 The	 streets	 were	 busy	 enough	 that	 he	 could	 blend	 in.	 If	 quick,	 he would	be	home	in	less	than	an	hour	and	wait	for	her	there.	But	it	would	be	much faster	and	easier	if	he	could	somehow	get	into	her	apartment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	 I	 help	 you?”	 came	 a	 female	 voice	 from	 behind	 Henry,	 giving	 him	 a start. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	to	find	the	double	glass	doors	that	led	into	the	building	slid	open and	a	silhouette	of	a	person,	small	and	slightly	round,	covered	in	a	long	cape	and deep	hood,	standing	in	the	shadows	of	the	entrance	lobby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	 I	 stutter?”	 she	 said.	 There	 was	 a	 hint	 of	 cruelness	 and	 bullying	 in	 her tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	 stared	 at	 her,	 bewildered.	 “Da..da…”	 He	 calmed	 his	 muscles	 with	 a long	inhale	then	continued.	“Do	we	know	each	other?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s	 say,	 I	 know	 you.	 You’re	 Liza’s	 friend.	 I’ve	 seen	 you	 coming	 and going.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	can	I	help	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 can	 get	 in	 here	 before	 one	 of	 those	 new	 Keeper	 androids	 comes	 by,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	voice	ordered.	There	was	gravel	in	her	tone	hinting	at	age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	scurried	through	the	door.	The	woman	turned	away	from	him	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 could	 see	 her	 face,	 and	 she	 walked	 to	 the	 lift.	 Raising	 her	 right	 arm,	 she waved	 for	 him	 to	 follow	 her.	 Inside,	 she	 kept	 her	 head	 bent	 low	 and	 spoke, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Floor	three	hundred.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	 stood	 with	 his	 back	 to	 the	 sidewall	 of	 the	 lift,	 staring	 wildly	 at	 the shiny	black	cape	that	hid	its	inhabitant.	His	curiosity	begged	him	to	talk	to	her, find	out	who	she	was,	but	a	sense	of	obligation	and	urgency	told	him	to	ditch	the stranger	and	head	straight	for	Liza’s	apartment. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>“You	won’t	get	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	what	you’re	thinking,	and	you	won’t	get	into	her	apartment	without getting	noticed.	She	is	on	the	list	now.	All	eyes	are	monitoring	her	and	about	ten thousand	others	who	have	been	called.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Floor	three-hundred,”	came	a	voice	in	the	lift	announcing	their	arrival.	The elevator	gently	stopped	and	the	doors	slid	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	flat	is	just	over	here.	Best	you	follow	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	 did	 as	 he	 was	 told.	 The	 woman’s	 flat	 was	 small,	 like	 most	 living quarters	in	the	overcrowded	city.	The	entirety	of	her	home	existed	in	two	rooms, one	 for	 living,	 cooking	 and	 sleeping,	 combined	 with	 a	 ceiling	 to	 floor	 glass window	facing	south,	and	an	adjacent	toilet	and	washroom	to	the	east. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	stranger	continued	 inside,	keeping	her	 back	to	Henry.	 He	stopped	after passing	through	the	entrance,	unsure	about	following	her	any	further. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hurry	in	here.	My	cloaking	algorithm	only	lasts	a	few	minutes	before	they notice	the	glitch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	 snapped	 his	 head	 back	 in	 confusion.	 The	 door	 slid	 shut	 behind	 him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cloaking	algorithm?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	ignored	his	question.	“Sit	over	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	pointed	a	hidden	finger,	draped	under	an	oversized	sleeve,	at	the basic	two-seater	sofa	sat	against	the	west	wall,	next	to	the	window.	Opposite	the couch	 were	 two	 wooden	 chairs	 with	 seats	 covered	 in	 a	 herringbone	 wool material	 and	 decorated	 with	 white	 crocheted	 doilies	 lain	 over	 the	 top	 of	 their back	supports.	Henry	felt	an	overwhelming	desire	to	touch	the	seat	of	the	chairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Real,	 organic	 material	 was	 so	 rare	 in	 the	 Sanctuary.	 He	 had	 heard	 of	 a	 few antiques	that	still	existed	from	a	time	before	everything	was	manufactured	with 3D	 pico-printers.	 A	 time	 when	 objects	 were	 made	 from	 things	 grown	 and collected	 by	 hands.	 Back	 when	 animals	 and	 trees	 still	 existed	 on	 the	 planet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Antiques	 were	 a	 passion	 of	 his.	 But	 only	 through	 study.	 He	 rarely	 came	 across one	in	person,	much	less	two	in	the	same	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 said	 sit,”	 commanded	 the	 woman,	 breaking	 him	 from	 his	 temporary trance. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>Henry	 sat	 immediately	 on	 the	 edge	 of	 the	 sofa,	 his	 body	 wound	 tight	 and ready	to	bounce	up	and	run	out	of	the	flat	at	any	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 stranger	 shuffled	 over	 to	 her	 compact	 kitchen:	 one	 short	 countertop against	the	wall	with	a	stove	and	sink.	Like	a	picture	framed,	the	designated	area was	 delineated	 from	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 open-plan	 room	 by	 cabinets	 underneath	 the counter	 to	 the	 floor	 and	 open	 shelves	 reaching	 all	 the	 way	 to	 the	 ceiling overhead.	 The	 shelves	 and	 wall	 brackets	 burst	 with	 utensils,	 pots,	 pans,	 and dishware	 stacked	 and	 hung	 in	 an	 orderly	 manner.	 They	 had	 about	 them	 the appearance	of	many	years	collected	and	used	but	well	taken	care	of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 her	 back	 still	 to	 Henry,	 she	 peeled	 back	 her	 hood	 and	 released	 a fountain	 of	 wild,	 curly	 grey	 and	 silver	 hair	 that	 hung	 down	 to	 her	 shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	 almost	 let	 out	 an	 audible	 gasp.	 He	 had	 to	 force	 himself	 to	 sit	 quietly, gripping	his	knees	to	hold	in	his	surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">An	elderly	woman?	How	is	that	possible? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	women	collected	a	tea	kettle,	filled	it	with	water	from	the	sink	tap,	and set	it	on	the	stove. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	a	start,”	she	said	to	herself.	And	set	about	removing	two	mugs	from the	shelf	to	her	left.	“I	prefer	the	old-fashioned	way.	Kettle	on	the	stove.	Those food	replicators	never	quite	got	it	right.	Everything	tastes	like	metal	from	those damn	things.	But	you	understand,	don’t	you,	Henry?	That’s	why	you	brew	your own	tea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	blinked	before	answering.	“Ya…ya…yes.	But	how	do	you	know	so…</p>
<p class="calibre1">so…so	much	about	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	woman	turned	to	face	her	visitor.	She	looked	even	older	than	Henry	had guessed.	 Her	 skin	 was	 dry,	 and	 the	 deep	 wrinkles	 around	 her	 face	 were	 well worn	into	the	loose	flesh	that	drooped	downward	as	if	she	were	a	living	melted candle.	Her	sea	mist	green	eyes	were	the	only	part	of	her	that	hinted	at	a	vibrant and	still	competent	human. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	 has	 an	 old	 banger	 like	 me	 avoided	 Ascension?”	 she	 finished	 his thought.	“That’s	what	you	want	to	know,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?	What’s	it	to	you?”	She	raised	one	eyebrow	as	the	corner	of	her	mouth</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>slid	 upward	 into	 a	 half-smile,	 pulling	 the	 sagging	 skin	 around	 her	 mouth	 and cheek	along	the	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	a…a…a	friend.	I	mean	Liza.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	know.	And	you	won’t	be	far	behind	your	friend.	Just	one	year	before you’re	called	to	Ascend.	Unless,	of	course,	they	change	the	rules	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	had	a	sudden	realization.	An	idea	which	sent	his	heart	racing	and	hope soaring.	“Can	you	help	us?	Help	us	avoid	Ascension?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why,	Henry	Ford.”	She	let	out	a	loud	crackling	laugh.	“That’s	probably	the most	forward	you’ve	been	your	entire	life.”	The	woman	removed	her	cape	and shuffled	 back	 towards	 the	 entrance,	 where	 she	 hung	 the	 limp	 cloth	 on	 a	 lonely naked	hook. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	high-pitched	whistle	from	the	kettle	ejaculated	into	the	air,	giving	Henry	a jolt.	 He	 half	 expected	 the	 alarm	 to	 wake	 him	 from	 this	 strange	 dream.	 But	 the smell	of	freshly	brewed	tea	and	old	things,	musty	things,	confirmed	it	was	real. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	couldn’t	ever	remember	having	scents	in	his	dreams. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 old	 woman	 calmly	 made	 her	 way	 back	 to	 the	 Kettle	 and	 poured	 the steaming	liquid	into	a	teapot	while	continuing	to	talk.	“Well,	I	guess	it	depends on	what	you	mean	by	helping	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	understand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	no	influence	or	means	of	helping	you	or	Liza	avoid	Ascension.	No, I’m	very	sorry	about	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lifting	the	tea	mugs	onto	a	tray	along	with	a	full	teapot,	she	carried	it	over	to the	 seating	 area.	 Upon	 suddenly	 noticing	 that	 she	 might	 need	 help,	 Henry jumped	to	his	feet	and	insisted	on	taking	the	tray	from	her	and	placed	it	on	the wooden	coffee	table	sat	between	the	sofa	and	chairs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	old	woman	took	a	seat	in	one	of	the	antique	chairs.	“I	take	mine	white, darling.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	poured. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	that	doesn’t	mean	I	can’t	help	you	with	what	comes	after	Ascension,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	said	matter	of	fact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry’s	mouth	dropped	open,	and	his	eyes	swelled.	Slowly,	he	lifted	his	face to	meet	her	eye	to	eye.	The	hot	tea	continued	to	pour	out	of	the	pot,	spilling	over</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>the	mug's	lip	and	onto	the	tray. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>CHAPTER	THREE</p>
<p class="calibre1">“WELCOME,	 Ms	 Lee.	 My	 name	 is	 Hildra,	 and	 I’ll	 be	 your	 Arranger	 for Ascension.”	said	the	woman	appointed	to	help	Liza	plan	the	end	of	her	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 Arranger	 was	 a	 lucky	 woman.	 She	 looked	 to	 be	 in	 her	 early	 twenties, meaning	she	wouldn’t	be	up	for	Ascension	for	quite	some	time,	if	ever.	Her	dark smooth	 skin	 was	 the	 perfect	 example	 of	 youth’s	 bounty:	 firm,	 hydrated,	 and wrinkle-free.	 A	 black	 halo	 of	 hair	 crowned	 her	 round	 cherub	 face	 and	 brown almond	eyes.	She	wore	a	form-fitted	grey	uniform	with	the	Dignity	orange	flame logo	on	the	right	chest,	accentuating	her	firm	breasts	and	a	lean	muscular	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	 hated	 her	 already.	 Not	 for	 her	 beauty.	 Liza	 was	 not	 the	 jealous	 type.	 She hated	her	for	the	currency	of	her	youth—the	price	of	living	she	could	now,	never afford. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	 inched	 into	 the	 private	 consultation	 room	 and	 stopped.	 The	 sparsely decorated	suite	felt	impromptu	and	temporary.	A	single	desk	sat	facing	the	door, behind	 which	 the	 human	 Arranger	 assigned	 to	 her	 Ascension	 case	 was	 still smiling	at	her.	In	front	of	the	desk	were	three	chairs,	one	facing	Hildra	and	the other	two	tucked	away	over	to	the	room's	left	side.	The	furniture	was	basic	and minimalist,	 procured	 for	 its	 fast	 and	 straightforward	 production	 requirements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ascension	 clinics	 had	 sprung	 up	 all	 around	 the	 Sanctuary	 within	 weeks	 of	 the program	being	announced.	The	sterile,	nearly	empty,	white	room	reflected	speed of	deployment	over-attention	to	detail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 seeing	 Liza	 hesitate	 at	 the	 door,	 she	 waved	 towards	 the	 seat	 facing	 her desk.	“Please	come	in,	Liza.	Can	I	call	you	Liza?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>Liza	 clutched	 her	 handbag	 tightly	 against	 her	 chest	 with	 both	 arms	 and cautiously	walked	over	to	the	desk,	slowly	sitting	down	on	the	edge	of	a	chair	at a	slight	angle,	as	if	she	were	riding	a	horse	side-saddle	(as	if	horses	even	existed anymore).	 Sitting	 all	 the	 way	 back	 into	 the	 chair	 would	 be	 wrong,	 she	 felt, conciliatory	even.	This	wasn’t	a	welcome	visit,	even	if	the	Arranger	had	put	on	a wide,	 friendly	 smile	 and	 talked	 to	 her	 in	 a	 soft	 familiar	 voice.	 No,	 Liza	 would not	make	this	easy	for	the	Government.	Sitting	on	the	edge	of	her	seat	was	her protest,	her	last	act	of	resistance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hildra	waved	her	hand	over	the	black	glass	circle	flush	in	the	surface	of	her desk	and	a	holographic	screen	beamed	up	and	into	the	ether	of	the	room.	In	the upper	left	corner	of	the	screen	was	Liza’s	3d	image.	Listed	next	to	her	photo	was the	standard	bio-metric	identification	records	of	every	Sanctuary	citizen:	genome sequencing,	retinal	scan,	brain	electroencephalogram,	and	voice	imprint.	Nobody was	invisible.	There	was	no	off-grid	in	the	Sanctuary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hildra’s	 eyes	 shifted	 left	 to	 right	 as	 she	 scanned	 the	 data.	 Satisfied,	 she turned	her	focus	to	Liza.	“Let	me	start	by	saying	how	proud	we	are	that	you	have volunteered	 to	 Ascend	 on	 behalf	 of	 the	 safety	 and	 health	 of	 the	 Sanctuary	 and humanity	 itself.	 I	 know	 this	 must	 be	 difficult	 to	 take	 in.”	 The	 words	 were robotic,	rehearsed	and	well-tried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	 remained	 frozen;	 her	 brow	 pinched.	 Talking	 seemed	 absurd.	 She	 was here	to	listen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Arranger	stared	at	her	for	a	moment,	took	a	deep	breath	and	started	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 near	 eye	 roll	 hinted	 at	 tiredness,	 boredom,	 obligation.	 She	 had	 been	 here before.	“How	are	you	coping?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 burst	 of	 unexpected	 laughter	 burst	 out	 of	 Liza.	 She	 could	 hear	 how demonic	 it	 sounded,	 and	 that	 gave	 her	 some	 pleasure.	 She	 hoped	 it	 sounded murderous,	 terrifying	 and	 out	 of	 control.	 However,	 Hildra	 just	 tilted	 her	 head sympathetically,	 unaffected.	 Liza’s	 uncontrolled	 laughter	 suddenly	 seemed laughable	and	childish.	This	was	not	how	she	wanted	the	session	to	go.	She	was supposed	to	be	in	control.	As	her	cheeks	burned	red,	she	let	out	one	or	two	more short	chuckles	as	if	winding	down	and	sat	back	in	her	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hildra	gave	her	head	a	slight	shake.	“Ms	Lee,	I	know	this	is	hard.	But	you</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>have	always	understood	the	purpose	of	the	Sanctuary.	We	are	trying	to	save	the last	of	humanity	here.	You	have	benefited	from	and	contributed	to	twenty	years of	 effort	 and	 innovation	 to	 rebuild	 life	 on	 the	 planet.	 It’s	 easy	 at	 that	 time	 to forget	what	is	at	risk.	To	start	feeling	safe	again.	To	start	feeling	the	city	has	an obligation	 to	 you,	 rather	 than	 the	 other	 way	 around.	 If	 we	 don’t	 operate	 on	 a zero-tolerance	policy	concerning	a	new	epidemic,	we	are	all	at	risk.	Everything is	at	risk.	There	are	no	other	options	for	any	of	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Easy	for	you	to	say,”	snapped	Liza.	“You’re	not	the	one	Ascending.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	all	die,	Ms	Lee.	That’s	a	fact	of	life.	Would	you	rather	suffer	a	horrible death	by	FossilFlu?	Like	your	parents?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza’s	face	washed	pale	at	the	mention	of	her	parents.	Memories	of	sickness, fear,	 pain	 and	 abandonment	 crawled	 into	 her	 like	 a	 dense	 fog,	 suffocating	 her resistance.	She	suddenly	felt	helpless	all	over	again,	like	a	child	lost	in	the	wild. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 two	 women	 stared	 into	 each	 other’s	 eyes	 as	 if	 competing	 to	 see	 who would	blink	first.	A	flash	of	light	on	the	holographic	screen	indicated	new	data coming	 in.	 They	 both	 shifted	 their	 gaze	 simultaneously	 to	 a	 red	 flag	 that	 had appeared	on	Liza’s	registration	form	in	the	upper	right	corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 that’s	 interesting,”	 said	 the	 Arranger.	 “Your	 record	 has	 just	 been updated.	 Seems	 you’ve	 had	 contact	 with	 the	 protestors	 since	 your	 visit	 to	 the clinic?”	Hildra	looked	through	the	screen	with	a	single	raised	eyebrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza’s	eyes	grew	wide.	“What!	That’s	ridiculous.	She	followed	me	to	my	car. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	told	her	to	go	away.	It	was	only	minutes.”	Fear	crept	into	her	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	see	that.	But	then	you	delayed	this	meeting	for	over	twelve	hours.	I hope	you	see	why	we	might	have	some	concerns	about	your	commitment	to	the Ascension	program.	Either	way,	it	means	we	are	dealing	with	a	Red	Form	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	 leaned	 forward,	 trying	 hard	 to	 read	 the	 holoscreen’s	 reversed	 text. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	does	that	mean?	A	Red	Form?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	a	stern	look,	Hildra	silently	invited	Liza	to	sit	back.	Liza	did	as	she	was told. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 means	 we	 now	 have	 limited	 options.	 You	 can	 go	 directly	 to	 the	 Oasis from	 the	 clinic	 today.	 There	 you	 will	 live	 one	 week	 of	 bliss	 before	 your Ascension.	Within	reason,	you	can	have	just	about	anything	you	desire	while	in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>the	Oasis.	It’s	our	way	of	saying	thank	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	stirred	in	her	seat.	“And	option	two?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or	you	can	be	escorted	to	your	home	by	the	Keepers’	units	today,	and	they will	remain	with	you,	in	your	home,	for	three	days,	allowing	you	time	to	get	any outstanding	business	in	order.	Then	you	will	proceed	to	the	Oasis.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	 jumped	 to	 her	 feet.	 Hildra’s	 hand	 moved	 quickly	 under	 her	 desk	 as	 if about	to	set	off	a	remote	alarm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Three	days!	You	can’t	do	this!”	Liza	screamed.	“I	have	a	life,	people	I	need to	see,	things	I	want	to	do	before	my	Ascension.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hildra	shot	Liza	an	abhorrent	look.	“Ms	Lee,	we	are	not	monsters.	I	am	here to	help	you,	not	hurt	you.	Anyone	you	want	to	see	will	be	allowed	to	visit	you during	the	three	days.	We	wouldn’t	dare	think	of	stopping	you	from	saying	your goodbyes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	huffed	at	the	answer.	“Right,	and	will	they	also	then	be	‘Red	Flagged’</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	having	visited	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chances	 are,	 anyone	 you	 have	 been	 in	 contact	 with	 of	 a	 personal	 nature over	 the	 last	 twelve	 months	 is	 already	 under	 supervision.	 Until	 you	 Ascend,	 of course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	 let	 her	 shoulders	 drop	 in	 total	 resignation.	 What’s	 the	 point	 anymore? </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 thought.	 This	 is	 only	 going	 in	 one	 direction.	 “What	 will	 it	 be	 like?	 The end?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	won’t	even	know	it	is	happening,”	Hildra	offered	a	conciliatory	grin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	released	a	heavy	sigh.	“Tell	me	then,	how	do	I	end	my	life?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hildra	nodded	gratuitously.	“As	I	said.	We	have	two	options…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 Arranger	 proceeded	 down	 a	 list	 of	 End-of-Life	 Service	 options:	 free options,	 granted	 options	 to	 be	 gifted	 by	 loved	 ones,	 and	 paid	 selections.	 Liza listened	 numbly,	 saying	 nothing,	 allowing	 Hildra	 to	 read	 uninterrupted.	 The Arranger	concluded	her	Ascension	registration	checklist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 finally,”	 Hildra	 sat	 forward,	 excitement	 rising	 in	 her	 voice.	 “This	 is always	my	favourite	part,”	she	said	giddily.	“We	have	produced	a	digital	epitaph of	 your	 life	 which	 will	 be	 permanently	 archived	 in	 the	 Sanctuary’s	 official cenotaph.”	 Hildra	 placed	 her	 hand	 into	 the	 screen,	 flicked	 her	 fingers	 to	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>right,	 and	 sent	 the	 projection	 onto	 the	 wall.	 “Please,	 join	 me	 in	 celebrating	 the life	of	Liza	Lee.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	artificial	lights	overhead	dimmed,	and	the	holographic	screen	expanded itself	until	larger	than	life.	A	soft	musical	note	lingered	in	the	air,	swelling	into	a movement	 of	 string	 instruments	 and	 then	 even	 larger	 until	 a	 full	 orchestral soundtrack	introduced	the	title	screen	with	the	words:	 <i class="calibre4">Liza	Lee,	Born	May	21st,</i> <i class="calibre4">2121,	Blissfully	Ascended	July	16th,	2161</i>.	Liza	stared	at	the	wall	with	wide	eyes, bewildered	and	confused.	Then,	the	image	of	herself,	no	older	than	five,	arriving at	the	Sanctuary’s	orphanage,	faded	in	from	black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hildra	sat	back	in	her	chair	and	crossed	her	arms.	A	smile	slid	upward	on	her face	as	she	lifted	her	chin	in	pride,	self-assured	Liza	would	agree	that	the	movie of	her	life	was	a	success. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 mouth	 hung	 open,	 breath	 held,	 Liza	 watched	 her	 life’s	 story	 play	 out before	 her.	 Moments,	 her	 moments,	 her	 experiences	 that	 had	 been	 recorded	 by her	virtual	assistant	had	been	edited	by	strangers	into	a	montage	of	a	person	she barely	recognized.	Overlays	and	fades	announced	transitions	from	teen	years	to young	 adult	 to	 the	 outstanding	 citizen	 Liza	 had	 become.	 Beautiful	 pictures	 of Liza	 smiling,	 laughing,	 showing	 compassion	 by	 helping	 others,	 and	 working hard	at	helping	build	a	life	for	the	last	of	humanity	in	the	Sanctuary	played	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Absent	were	the	dark	moments,	the	scared	and	lonely	moments,	times	when	she cried	 herself	 to	 sleep	 thinking	 of	 her	 lost	 parents.	 Times	 when	 she	 wondered what	life	was	really	all	about.	This	movie	version	of	her	life	was	always	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	almost	jealous	of	the	person	on	the	screen.	What	a	remarkable	life	that person	lived,	she	thought.  <i class="calibre4">I	wish	I	could	be	her. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	digital	epitaph	ended	with	a	surge	of	patriotic	music	and	a	glowing	still image	of	Liza	looking	upward,	out	across	the	Sanctuary’s	glass	and	steel	skyline, beaming	 with	 pride,	 a	 beacon	 of	 hope	 and	 self-sacrifice.	 This	 person	 loved	 the city	more	than	herself.	Hell,	this	person	would	have	inspired	her	to	sacrifice	her life	 for	 the	 Sanctuary.	 Except	 Liza	 remembered	 that	 image,	 that	 very	 moment now	staring	back	at	her	on	the	wall,	and	it	wasn’t	the	Sanctuary	she	was	thinking about.	It	was	Henry.	That	was	the	moment	she	was	walking	home	after	their	first night	together.	She	wasn’t	wondering	what	she	could	do	to	save	humanity.	No, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>she	was	thinking	of	herself.	She	was	thinking—for	the	first	time	in	her	life,	she had	 something	 to	 live	 for.	 She	 was	 thinking	 of	 the	 future.	 How	 naïve	 she	 was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 how	 ironic	 this	 would	 be	 the	 picture	 they	 would	 choose	 to	 be	 the	 last moment	of	her	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 also	 have	 the	 option	 for	 your	 visitors	 to	 create	 their	 own	 storylines,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">came	an	abrupt	interruption	in	Hildra’s	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse	me?”	Liza	said,	slowly	looking	to	the	Arranger	and	wiping	away	a tiny	bit	of	saliva	that	had	filled	the	corner	of	her	drawn	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lights	came	back	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“None	of	us	likes	to	admit	it,	Ms	Lee,	but	not	everyone	you’ve	encountered in	 your	 lifetime	 was	 satisfied	 with	 your	 relationship.	 This	 option,	 should	 you choose,	allows	the	viewer	to	interact	with	their	memories	of	you…and	include	a few	minor	changes.	An	unrequited	love	might	finally	hear	you	say	the	words	‘I love	 you,’	 or	 an	 old	 friend	 might	 need	 to	 apologise	 for	 the	 guilt	 they	 had	 been harbouring	and,	in	return,	hear	you	forgive	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	those	are	lies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	it,	though?	If	the	viewer	believes	it?	I	mean,	it	really	can’t	harm	you	at all,	can	it?	And	be	certain,	we	do	not	allow	downloading	or	rewriting	of	original data.	 These	 are	 temporary	 interventions.	 All	 records	 of	 the	 interaction	 will	 be erased.	 There	 is	 absolutely	 no	 risk	 whatsoever	 that	 your	 real-life	 would	 be confused	or	overwritten	by	a	new	storyline.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 want	 to	 turn	 my	 life	 into	 a	 game?	 Step	 right	 up	 and	 pick	 your	 own ending!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some	 of	 our	 guests…”	 she	 paused.	 “The	 more	 compassionate	 ones”,	 she uttered	low,	under	her	breath	as	if	Liza	couldn’t	hear	her.	“…they	rather	like	this option.	Like	organ	donations,	they	see	it	as	their	final	gift	to	humanity.	After	all, what	use	are	your	memories	to	you	after	you’re	gone?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Giving	my	bloody	life	is	gift	enough	to	this	city.	Let	the	survivors	live	with their	guilt.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course,	this	is	just	an	option.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	sudden	urge	to	get	up	and	walk	out	shot	through	Liza,	only	hampered	by the	nagging	question,  <i class="calibre4">what	will	happen	to	Henry? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a><img src="index-37_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll	take	the	basic	program,”	Liza	said	hurriedly.	“No	frills,	no	gifted	guest options.	Just	that	silly	movie	thing	if	I	have	to,	and	one	other	option.	I’d	like	my life	files	deleted	from	the	archives—all	of	it.	Everything	ever	recorded	about	me, either	publicly	in	others’	feeds	or	by	my	virtual	assistant.	I	want	my	experiences to	be	erased	from	history.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hildra	 sat	 back,	 her	 brow	 pinched	 in	 surprise.	 “Ms	 Lee.	 I’ve	 never…you understand	the	Government	mandates	that	all	lives	are	recorded	and	kept	in	the cities’	archives.	A	total	delete	is	not	possible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	sat	forward	and	leaned	in	aggressively.	“Then	what	are	the	options	for being	publicly	forgotten?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hildra	 hesitated.	 “Well,	 there	 is	 one	 option	 for	 the	 insane	 or	 if	 you	 are	 a convicted	 criminal.	 We	 can	 mark	 your	 life	 file	 as	  <i class="calibre4">Sanctioned</i>.	 These	 lives	 are held	 in	 a	 separate	 database,	 firewalled,	 encrypted,	 and	 inaccessible.	 Are	 you really	sure	you	want	to	be	recorded	in	history	with	society's	least	desirables?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	cynical	smile	stretched	across	Liza’s	face.	“What	will	it	matter	to	me	when I’m	gone.”	She	threw	the	words	back	at	the	Arranger	like	a	punch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very	 well.”	 Hildra’s	 voice	 went	 crisp.	 “I’ll	 just	 mark	 your	 file	 clinically insane,	as	you	like.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very	well,”	Liza	imitated	her	words	in	a	contemptuous	tone.	“Now,	where	is the	Keeper.	I’m	ready	to	go	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hildra	 produced	 one	 last	 false	 smile,	 all	 teeth,	 no	 truth.	 She	 closed	 the holoscreen	in	front	of	her	with	a	whisk	of	her	hand.	Her	jaw	muscles	flexed,	and her	lips	twitched,	as	most	peoples	did	when	using	their	subvocalization	implant to	 talk	 to	 their	 virtual	 assistants.	 From	 behind	 Liza	 appeared	 a	 silver-haired, metallic	Keeper’s	android	at	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	rose	out	of	her	chair	and	turned	to	leave	the	room	without	so	much	as	a nod	to	Hildra.	As	she	reached	the	door,	she	heard	a	loud	sigh	come	from	behind her.	The	exasperated	tone	of	the	Arranger’s	heavy	breath	gave	Liza	a	feeling	of satisfaction.	 She	 may	 have	 lost	 the	 battle	 to	 save	 her	 life,	 but	 she	 won	 the	 last word.  <i class="calibre4">Take	that</i>,	she	said	silently,	and	a	thin	smile	lit	up	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>Back	 at	 Liza’s	 apartment	 building,	 she	 hurried	 through	 the	 entrance	 lobby	 and hoped	the	lift	would	be	clear	of	other	residents	as	the	silent	Keeper	android	kept pace	behind	her.	The	thought	of	running	into	someone	she	knew	and	facing	an overly	sympathetic	face	with	the	inevitable,	“I’m	so	sorry…”	was	more	than	she could	bear.	It	had	been	less	than	forty-eight	hours	since	she	was	the	one	offering condolences.	 The	 irony	 would	 have	 caused	 her	 to	 smile	 if	 the	 situation	 didn’t end	in	her	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 lift	 was	 empty.	 Inside,	 her	 virtual	 assistant	 spoke.	 “Hello,	 Liza.	 Floor ninety-nine?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	 Liza	 replied.	 Staring	 forward,	 she	 avoiding	 eye	 contact	 with	 the Keeper’s	android,	who	had	tucked	itself	up	against	the	wall	to	her	right,	within breathing	 distance	 if	 the	 thing	 could	 breathe.	 She	 had	 never	 been	 this	 close	 to one	before.	Most	people	kept	their	distance	from	the	new	android	model.	Their almost	perfect	human	movement	was	a	step	too	far	for	Liza.	And	nobody	really understood	 why	 the	 Government	 had	 been	 building	 them	 secretly.	 This	 one hadn’t	said	a	word	to	Liza	yet,	and	she	was	keen	to	keep	it	that	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lift	purred	upward	and	came	to	a	gentle,	almost	imperceptible	stop.	Liza held	 her	 breath.	 The	 doors	 slid	 open	 to	 her	 floor.	 The	 corridor	 was	 clear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hurrying	 down	 the	 hall,	 Liza	 ducked	 into	 her	 apartment	 quickly.	 The	 Keeper followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome	home,”	said	her	assistant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	ignored	the	customary	greeting	and	turned,	facing	the	Keeper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stay	here,	by	the	door.	I	don’t	want	you	any	further	inside	my	home.”	Liza kept	her	eyes	on	its	body,	refusing	to	look	directly	into	its	steel	blue	glass	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Understood,”	 the	 creature	 spoke	 to	 her	 for	 the	 first	 time.	 Its	 eerily	 human voice	sent	a	chill	down	Liza’s	spine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside,	Liza	looked	around	and	had	a	strange	sensation	she	was	in	someone else’s	house.	She	felt	a	voyeur	about	to	be	caught	and	sent	away	at	any	minute. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">This	 isn’t	 the	 time	 to	 have	 an	 identity	 crisis</i>,	 she	 scolded	 herself.	 She	 only	 had three	days.	She	needed	to	get	organized.	Well,	really,	she	didn’t.	However,	there was	no	way	she	could	survive	three	days	if	she	felt	things	were	out	of	order.  <i class="calibre4">My</i> <i class="calibre4">closets</i>,	she	thought	silently.  <i class="calibre4">I’ll	start	with	my	wardrobe	and	then	move	on	to	my</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a> <i class="calibre4">storage. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	left	the	Keeper	at	the	door	and	made	her	way	back	into	the	apartment's only	 bedroom.	 Deep	 into	 her	 wardrobe	 within	 minutes,	 two	 distinct	 piles	 rose from	 the	 ground:	 things	 for	 recycling	 and	 stuff	 for	 donation.	 Everything	 in	 the Sanctuary	was	recycled	if	not	reused.	She	wore	the	clothes	of	others	before	her, and	soon,	someone	new	would	be	in	her	favourite	white	pull-over,	unless	she	put it	 in	 the	 recycled	 materials	 pile,	 to	 be	 stripped	 back	 to	 its	 minerals	 and reconstituted	into	a	new,	more	modern	design.	Liza	caught	herself	staring	at	the two	 lumps	 of	 clothing.	 After	 a	 long	 sigh,	 she	 lifted	 everything	 in	 the	 donation pile	and	heaped	them	in	with	the	recycles.  <i class="calibre4">Fuck	it.	Burn	it	all.	Erase	Liza	Lee. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly	a	random	thought	pinched	at	her	heart.	Henry.	In	her	haste	to	get busy,	she	had	forgotten	she	needed	to	contact	Henry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“SIVA,	are	there	any	messages	for	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	 are	 fifty-two	 messages	 unheard.	 All	 are	 from	 Henry.	 He	 spent	 the night	sleeping	outside	the	main	entrance	doors	last	night	as	well.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	went	stiff.	Her	eyes	glazed	over	and	her	mind	wandered	into	the	most horrible	 of	 scenarios.	 She	 felt	 both	 fear	 and	 sadness	 for	 Henry	 at	 once.	 “God, how	 could	 I	 have	 not	 contacted	 him,”	 she	 whispered,	 horrified	 at	 the	 person, herself	in	this	case,	who	could	do	such	a	thing	to	someone	they	loved.	Someone they	loved;	the	words	repeated	in	her	mind.	She	had	never	told	Henry	she	loved him,	not	in	those	exact	words,	even	though	he	confessed	his	love	for	her	many times	over.	But	yes,	she	did	love	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	is	he	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don’t	 know.	 There	 was	 a	 brief	 anomaly	 in	 the	 network.	 When	 it	 cleared, Henry	was	no	longer	outside	the	building.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 do	 you	 mean	 anomaly?	 That	 can’t	 happen.	 The	 network	 never	 goes down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don’t	have	an	answer	for	you,	Liza.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza’s	 hands	 began	 to	 involuntarily	 clench	 into	 white	 knuckles	 as	 panic tightened	its	grip	on	her	throat.	The	words	of	her	Arranger	rang	in	her	head:	Red Flag	file.	Henry	must	have	been	tagged	and	collected	by	the	Keepers.	They	were the	only	entity	powerful	enough	to	cause	a	black-out	in	the	network. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>“Oh	god,	oh	my…”	Liza	started	a	quick	pace	back	and	forth	in	her	bedroom, trying	 to	 figure	 out	 her	 next	 steps	 when	 suddenly	 SIVA	 spoke,	 giving	 Liza	 a start. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Liza,	you	have	a	visitor.	Henry	is	outside	your	door.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>CHAPTER	FOUR</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE	DOOR	to	Liza’s	flat	slid	open.	Henry’s	bright	blue	eyes,	crowned	by	his	thick strawberry-blond	 eyebrows,	 instantly	 glazed	 over	 with	 pending	 tears.	 He	 dared not	rush	in,	even	though	his	body	demanded	it.	Liza	hadn’t	been	expecting	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	arrival	was	an	intrusion,	a	necessary	intervention	to	win	back	her	trust.	And he	now	had	a	plan—a	way	to	save	them	both.	But	she	might	not	believe	him	or believe	in	him	any	longer.	Maybe	she	wanted	to	be	alone.	Perhaps	she	wanted	to sleep	 with	 more	 men	 before	 her	 pending	 Ascension.	 These	 thoughts	 haunted him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	 stood	 in	 her	 entrance	 staring	 at	 Henry.	 Words	 sat	 in	 the	 back	 of	 her tightening	throat,	unable	to	come	out.	She	hadn’t	wanted	to	cry.	Her	plan	was	to be	strong	for	him.	After	all,	he	was	the	one	who	would	have	to	live	without	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 fight	 as	 she	 may,	 emotion	 took	 over	 her	 will,	 and	 the	 tears	 poured	 out	 in trembling	sobs.	“I…I’m	so…sorry,”	she	stammered	between	jagged	breaths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	leapt	forward	and	pulled	her	into	his	body,	his	arms	wrapped	around her	in	a	ribbon	tied	tight.	They	both	wept	without	words	until	they	spent	all	their tears.	Liza	slowly	calmed	herself	and	caught	up	with	her	breathing.	That’s	when she	realized	she	could	feel	Henry’s	heart	pounding	against	his	chest.	Poor	Henry, what	had	she	done	to	him? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	wiped	her	cheeks	and	stepped	back	so	she	could	look	him	in	the	eyes.	“I should	have	called	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t.	 Please	 don’t	 apologize.	 I	 understand.	 I	 understand	 you	 like	 I’ve never	understood	anyone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>Liza	 let	 out	 a	 small,	 unexpected	 sigh	 which	 felt	 like	 letting	 air	 out	 of	 a balloon,	a	release	into	a	more	relaxed	state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	 then,	 a	 motion	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 entrance	 hall	 caught	 the	 corner	 of Henry’s	 vision.	 Startled,	 he	 pulled	 Liza	 behind	 him.	 The	 silver	 Keeper	 stepped into	the	hall	and	stared	at	them,	unspeaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Henry!	It’s	okay,”	Liza	grabbed	Henry’s	arm,	holding	him	back.	“It’s	been assigned	to	watch	over	me.	In	case	I	try	to	run	or	hide,	I	guess.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry’s	 muscles	 remained	 coiled.	 For	 what	 he	 had	 no	 idea.	 He	 had	 never been	in	a	physical	fight	with	another	human	his	entire	life,	much	less	a	Keeper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	wouldn’t	even	know	how	to	attack	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	continue	your	visitation	in	the	apartment,”	the	silver	android	asked	in a	 near-perfect	 human	 voice.	 The	 apartment	 door	 slid	 shut	 behind	 them.	 It	 was not	a	request. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	stepped	in	front	of	Henry.	“Let’s	do	as	it	says.	Please,	don’t	cause	any problems,	Henry.	It’s	too	dangerous	for	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me?	What	about	you?	How	long	will	it	be	staying	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	long	as	I	am	here.	Until	my	Ascension.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry’s	 cheeks	 burned	 red	 with	 a	 sudden	 rage.	 “Ha…ha…ha,”	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">stammered.	“How	long	do	we	have?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza’s	eyes	fell	to	the	ground.	“Three	days.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	palpable	silence	filled	the	gap	between	them	as	the	reality	of	their	situation settled	 in.	 After	 a	 few	 moments,	 Liza	 gently	 clasped	 his	 hand.	 “Come,	 let’s	 go talk	in	the	bedroom.	We	can	be	alone	in	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	 allowed	 himself	 to	 be	 led	 into	 her	 flat,	 keeping	 a	 hard	 stare	 on	 the Keeper	who	remained	at	the	end	of	the	entrance	hall,	turning	his	back	to	the	wall and	standing	guard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 soon	 as	 Liza’s	 bedroom	 door	 slid	 shut,	 she	 swung	 her	 arms	 around Henry’s	neck	and	pressed	her	lips	against	his.	Henry	met	her	approach	with	an open	 mouth,	 surprised.	 Liza	 had	 never	 been	 so	 explicit	 in	 her	 desire	 for	 him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within	seconds,	he	realized	it	was	really	happening.	She	wanted	him	as	much	as he	 wanted	 her.	 Perhaps	 she	 always	 did.	 But	 knowing	 it	 for	 certain	 made	 the moment	feel	like	the	first	kiss	all	over	again.	He	leaned	into	her,	and	their	lips</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>moved	flesh	to	flesh,	breath	to	breath.	Then	all	rhythm	disappeared.	A	frenzy	of lustful	activity	unravelled.	Liza	pulled	at	his	coat,	then	his	shirt,	as	he	ripped	her top	off.	They	hopped	on	one	foot	as	they	hurriedly	took	their	trousers	off.	Henry tripped	as	he	pulled	at	his	last	pant	leg,	and	he	fell	on	top	of	Liza,	forcing	them both	to	collapse	onto	the	bed.	The	mass	of	their	bodies	pressed	together	caused their	skin	to	pulsate	and	tingle.	Sensations	amplified	to	a	fever	pitch.	Liza’s	chest and	 groin	 rubbed	 and	 pressed	 into	 his	 gyrating	 body.	 Her	 back	 arched	 as	 he pulled	her	closer.	Inside,	they	were	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	act	was	quick.	Faster	than	usual.	They	both	found	the	end	in	a	rapturous moment	of	release	while	squeezing	the	other	in	a	near	suffocating	grip.	But	this was	not	the	end.	Henry	remained	inside,	and	they	wrapped	themselves	into	a	ball like	snakes	entwined	and	lay	together	for	over	an	hour,	silent,	awake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	trust	me?”	Henry	finally	spoke.	His	chin	nestled	on	top	of	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 felt	 her	 warm	 breath	 against	 his	 chest.	 “There	 is	 a	 way	 for	 us	 to	 be together.	If	that	is	what	you	want.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	 shot	 up,	 leaning	 on	 her	 right	 arm.	 His	 eyes	 were	 begging.	 “What	 you are	you	talking	about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	sat	up.	“Just	hear	me	out.	I	met	someone.	A	lady	in	your	building.	An elderly	woman.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	 crinkled	 her	 face	 in	 doubt.	 “There	 aren’t	 any	 elderly	 people	 in	 this building	anymore.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s	what	I	thought.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Henry	Ford,	what	are	you	talking	about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	can’t	talk	here.	Let’s	take	a	shower.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steam	filled	the	glass	cubical,	barely	large	enough	to	fit	two	grown	humans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	 looked	 at	 him,	 naked.	 His	 ivory	 and	 pink	 skin,	 ruby	 red	 nipples	 and	 light brown	 freckles	 across	 his	 shoulders	 and	 upper	 chest	 radiated	 under	 the	 water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	forgotten	about	her	Ascension	over	the	last	few	hours.	But	something	of his	 skin,	 so	 alive	 and	 transparent,	 reminded	 her	 of	 what	 she	 was	 losing.	 A sadness	set	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	lifted	her	chin,	locking	in	on	her	eyes.	The	sound	of	water	jetting	out</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>of	the	shower	muted	his	voice	from	the	outside	world.	“Did	they	tell	you	about the	process	of	Ascension?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	only	that	I	won’t	even	know	it	is	happening.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	 will	 put	 you	 into	 a	 coma.	 During	 this	 time,	 the	 Ascension	 network will	be	copying	your	brain's	entire	structure	down	to	the	last	DNA	strand.	All	the billions	 of	 synapsis	 that	 create	 your	 memories,	 your	 feelings,	 everything	 that makes	 up	 your	 existence	 will	 be	 turned	 into	 code	 and	 run	 through	 a	 neural network.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	would	they	do	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	a	new	AI	system	they	are	working	on.	A	program	that	will	amalgamate all	the	life	experiences	and	learnings	of	an	entire	generation.	It’s	a	sort	of	living time	capsule	showing	what	it	is	to	be	human	through	the	eyes	of	millions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	moved	slightly	away	from	him	until	her	back	was	up	against	the	glass wall.	The	words	of	the	Arranger	rang	through	her	head,  <i class="calibre4">“Your	visitors	can	create</i> <i class="calibre4">their	own	storylines.” </i>	A	sudden	fear	overwhelmed	her.	Not	only	was	her	death out	of	her	control,	but	now	so	was	her	eternal	life.	“They	can’t.	They	can’t	just take	our	lives	like	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	placed	his	hands	on	her	arms	gently.	“It	might	not	be	all	that	bad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza’s	 eyes	 ballooned.	 Who	 was	 this	 man	 talking	 to	 her?	 Where	 was	 the person	 appalled	 thinking	 about	 the	 mass	 suicide	 program?	 The	 person	 who fought	the	culling	of	the	weak	and	old? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	we	are	together.	I	mean.	It	might	be	worth	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	you	know	all	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 old	 woman	 told	 me.	 She	 was	 one	 of	 the	 original	 programmers	 on	 the Ascension	neural	network.	Before	she	was	taken	to	Ascend	herself,	she	secretly created	 a	 subroutine	 and	 buried	 it	 deep	 in	 the	 code,	 encrypted	 in	 a	 black	 box. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s	where	she	exists	now.	She	is	alive,	Liza.	And	I’ve	been	in	her	mind.	The apartment	she	took	me	to	upstairs	was	real,	as	if	everything	inside	existed,	all	of it.	 I	 smelt	 freshly	 brewed	 tea	 and	 touched	 organic	 materials.	 And	 there	 are others.	People	she	has	helped	who	have	joined	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Henry,	 that’s	 not	 living,”	 Liza's	 voice	 pleaded.	 “That’s	 a	 program, controlled	and	manipulated	by	someone	else.	It’s	like	being	buried	alive.	I	can’t</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>think	of	anything	more	terrifying.”	She	shook	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	stared	at	her	with	a	conviction	rare	for	him.	“What	other	choice	do	we have.	I	can’t	live	without	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	 met	 his	 confession	 with	 silence.	 She	 turned	 and	 stepped	 out	 of	 the shower.	 Grabbing	 a	 towel,	 she	 dried	 herself.	 Henry	 leaned	 up	 against	 the	 open glass	door,	staring	at	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	hear	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	Liza	said,	her	eyes	avoiding	him.	She	wrapped	the	towel	around	her breasts	and	tucked	it	tight	so	as	not	to	fall	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	can	you	be	so	cold.	I	thought	you	loved	me.	I	thought	we	loved	each other?”	 he	 pleaded.	 Henry	 came	 up	 directly	 behind	 her,	 his	 naked	 damp	 body pressing	 into	 her	 back.	 He	 wrapped	 his	 arms	 around	 her	 waist.	 “I	 mean	 it.	 I’m not	sticking	around.	We	either	ascend	together,	or	I	go	anyways,	right	after	you.	I take	my	own	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	spun	round.	“Don’t	say	that!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	you	will	do	it?	There’s	no	reason	to	wait.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	 pushed	 Henry	 back	 and	 made	 her	 way	 into	 her	 bedroom.	 Henry followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 is	 stopping	 you,	 Liza?”	 Henry’s	 voice	 grew	 more	 and	 more exasperated,	 and	 his	 stammer	 returned.	 “Wa…wa…we	 can	 be	 together	 forever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Isn’t	that	what	you	want	as	well?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza,	half-dressed,	turned	at	his	stutter,	feeling	responsible.	“I	do	want	to	be with	you,	Henry.	I	am	with	you.	Right	now,	right	here,	we	are	together.	Can’t	we let	this	be	enough?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry’s	 enthusiasm	 drained	 from	 his	 face.	 His	 flesh	 went	 a	 pallid	 ghostly white.	 He	 fell	 back	 onto	 the	 edge	 of	 her	 bed,	 with	 shoulders	 slumped	 forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tears	filled	his	eyes.	Liza	sat	next	to	him	in	silence.	After	a	few	minutes,	he	lay his	head	on	her	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	love	you,”	he	uttered	in	a	voice	so	mournful,	so	profound,	that	tears	came to	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liza	placed	her	hand	on	his	lap	and	turned	until	they	sat	face	to	face.	“Henry Ford,”	she	began	with	a	gentle	smile.	“I	love	you	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a><img src="index-46_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">And	there	it	was.	The	words	he	so	ached	to	hear	from	her	since	the	day	she walked	into	his	shop.	Received	with	a	joyous	rapture	of	relief	and	yet,	he	knew	it wasn’t	real. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lights	came	up	in	the	private	immersion	room	Henry	had	booked	next	to	the Sanctuary’s	 cenotaph	 for	 those	 who	 had	 ascended.	 The	 image	 of	 Liza	 and	 her apartment	faded	away	as	the	door	slid	open.	Henry’s	head	hung	low,	and	his	eyes remained	frozen	on	the	ground.	He	couldn’t	bring	himself	to	look	around	at	the empty	sterile	chamber	which	held	her	image	just	seconds	ago.	If	he	tried	hard,	he could	 still	 smell	 her.	 Rose	 and	 cedar.	 Rare	 Earth	 scents.	 Simulation	 only,	 of course.	As	soon	as	she	left	his	tea	shop,	he	would	lock	the	front	doors	and	let	the smell	linger.	Liza,	his	precious	Liza.	If	they	only	had	more	time	together,	it	could have	happened;	she	might	have	said	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 soft	 padding	 of	 feet	 moving	 in	 his	 direction	 announced	 his	 Dignity Arranger.	The	young	female,	dressed	in	a	grey	uniform	adorned	with	an	orange flame	on	her	breast,	walked	in	and	stood	before	him.	“Mr	Ford,	I	hope	that	was helpful.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	never	said	it,	though,	did	she.	Not	in	real	life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	network	is	an	accurate	version	of	Liza,	up	until	the	end.	She	made	the wish	that	you	be	able	to	add	to	her	storyline.	She	wanted	you	to	design	your	own ending.	So,	in	a	sense,	through	her	actions,	she	did	say	it.	And	now	it	is	time	for you	to	join	her.	Isn’t	that	what	you	both	want?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.”	He	said	in	a	voice	so	soft,	so	lost,	that	he	could	have	been	agreeing	to anything.	Henry	stood	to	join	her,	but	something	had	been	bugging	him.	“Why did	you	change	the	storyline?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	 was	 an	 old	 woman	 in	 Liza’s	 building	 in	 this	 version.	 That	 never happened	 in	 real	 life	 and	 I	 didn’t	 request	 the	 change.	 Liza	 found	 me	 sitting	 on the	 ground	 by	 her	 entrance	 the	 morning	 she	 returned	 from	 the	 clinic.	 I	 never visited	anyone	else’s	apartment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a><img src="index-47_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Arranger	tilted	 her	head	quizzically.	 “Wait,	let	me	 rerun	the	storyline.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	stared	off	into	space	as	the	re-enactment	played	privately	across	her	bionic lens	implant.	Blinking	twice,	she	finished	the	replay.	“No,	I’m	sorry.	I	didn’t	see any	  <i class="calibre4">old</i>	 woman	 in	 the	 re-enactment.	 Are	 you	 sure	 it	 wasn’t	 something	 you imagined?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	rubbed	his	hand	along	his	forehead.	“Strange.	She	seemed	so	real.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Arranger	pointed	to	the	door	with	an	upturned	full	hand.	“Mr	Ford,	we must	go	to	the	Oasis	now.	Your	Ascension	awaits	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	only	a	thin	blue	paper-like	gown,	Henry	climbed	aboard	the	white	plinth	bed that	 stood	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 a	 glass	 chamber	 inside	 the	 Oasis.	 The	 walls	 were opaque	 white,	 hiding	 the	 thousands	 of	 other	 Sanctuary	 citizens	 Ascending	 in their	own	private	Oasis	rooms.	He	lay	on	his	back,	staring	up	at	the	featureless ceiling.	Behind	him,	a	holographic	wall	lit	up	with	a	3D	outline	of	his	body	and internal	organs	glowing	green.	A	robot	medical	arm	descended	from	one	of	the chamber's	 corners	 and	 hovered	 next	 to	 his	 left	 arm.	 A	 voice	 from	 overhead spoke.	“Mr	Ford,	are	you	ready?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Henry	blinked	one	last	time.	“Ya…ya…yes,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 prick	 of	 the	 needle	 was	 cool	 and	 quick.	 Henry's	 mind	 slipped	 into	 a warm	 white	 light	 until	 nothing	 of	 the	 room	 was	 visible	 anymore.	 Slowly,	 the green	illuminated	organs	of	Henry	Ford	on	the	medical	screen	turned	amber. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Commencing	 brain	 scan	 and	 neural	 replication,”	 came	 the	 voice	 from	 the ceiling. </p>
