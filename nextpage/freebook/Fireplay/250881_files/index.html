<p class="calibre1"><a id="p6"></a><b class="calibre3">PROLOGUE</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">A flash	of	lightning	illuminated	the	cell	with	pale	light	for	only	a	split second,	long	enough	for	Hewad	Ghilzai	to	see	his	friend	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Positioned	unnaturally,	he	hadn’t	moved	since	the	American	soldiers</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	left	several	hours	ago.	Hewad	hadn’t	moved	either.	He	was	too	scared.	He’d been	hurt	too	many	times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hewad	 held	 his	 knees	 to	 his	 chest	 and	 kept	 his	 back	 against	 the	 wall.	 His mind	 was	 empty	 and	 his	 tear	 ducts	 were	 dry.	 Only	 his	 grief	 and	 the	 smell	 of human	 feces	 kept	 his	 attention	 in	 this	 world	 at	 all.	 He	 awaited	 the	 next.	 He’d taken	the	fight	to	the	infidel	and	ended	up	in	a	place	worse	than	hell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	done	everything	right.	Had	Allah	abandoned	him?	On	most	nights	the stars	provided	enough	light	to	see	the	outline	of	his	bed,	the	latrine	pail,	and	the grilled	steel	that	penned	him	in,	but	tonight	he	couldn’t	see	an	inch	in	front	of	his hand.	The	world	was	as	dark	as	the	heart	of	his	captors,	except	when	lightning lashed	at	the	mountains. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Footsteps	 approached	 and	 a	 faint	 light	 lit	 the	 corridor	 outside	 his	 cell.	 He instinctively	hugged	his	knees	tighter	and	his	eyes	shot	towards	the	door.	As	he waited	 the	 footsteps	 grew	 louder	 and	 the	 light	 brighter.	 He	 whimpered	 as	 the heavy	door	unlocked	with	a	clunk	and	opened	with	a	squeal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Evening,	haji.”	The	soldier’s	drawl	was	unmistakable,	even	as	the	cell	door slammed	shut.	“I	thought	you	could	use	some	company,	what	with	the	storm	and all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p7"></a>Hewad	said	nothing.	He	hadn’t	always	been	so	passive	and	afraid.	The	blows from	combat	boots	and	rifle	butts	had	started	a	conversion	that	mutilations	and degradation	had	completed.	He	was	a	broken	man,	a	spent	soul	trapped	in	a	body that	had	nearly	expired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing	to	say?”	The	soldier	sighed	as	he	held	the	flashlight	up	to	Hewad’s face.	 “You	 had	 some	 spunk,	 haji,	 but	 now	 you’re	 as	 lively	 as	 your	 friend	 over there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hewad	 lifted	 his	 hands	 to	 shield	 his	 eyes	 as	 the	 soldier	 laughed	 at	 his	 own joke.	 The	 light	 felt	 like	 another	 assault	 after	 so	 much	 darkness,	 though	 it	 was nothing	 compared	 to	 whatever	 struck	 him	 across	 the	 side	 of	 the	 head.	 It staggered	 him.	 He	 fell	 onto	 his	 side,	 curled	 into	 a	 ball,	 and	 tried	 to	 protect himself	as	best	he	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blows	rained	on	him	and	he	felt	himself	starting	to	black	out	when	he	heard an	 earsplitting	 boom	 and	 felt	 an	 enormous	 shockwave.	 He	 rolled	 onto	 his	 back and	 opened	 his	 eyes,	 confused.	 The	 flashlight	 was	 on	 the	 ground,	 illuminating the	chaos.	The	soldier	lay	still	and	half	of	the	wall	was	missing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hewad	 blinked	 several	 times	 and	 his	 senses	 slowly	 returned.	 His	 pain	 was intense,	 but	 in	 the	 depths	 of	 his	 mind	 excitement	 sparked.	 He	 looked	 at	 the soldier	 for	 several	 minutes,	 waiting	 for	 him	 to	 move.	 Finally,	 he	 inched	 closer, paused,	 and	 then	 scurried	 over	 and	 felt	 for	 a	 pulse.	 None.	 Allah	 had	 delivered him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shoved	the	man.	When	the	body	didn’t	move	Hewad’s	eyes	widened	and he	clawed	for	the	man’s	canteen,	unscrewed	the	lid,	and	drank	deeply.	Some	of the	 water	 spilled	 to	 the	 sand	 as	 he	 sucked	 at	 it,	 gulping	 and	 coughing	 as	 he fought	to	overcome	the	most	incredible	thirst. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	the	water	ran	out	he	glanced	at	the	soldier’s	sidearm.	To	take	it	would be	to	re-enter	the	fight,	to	forget	the	next	life	for	the	moment	and	take	up	arms again	in	this	world.	He	stared	at	the	weapon	for	several	long	moments	and	then looked	at	the	hole	that	had	been	blown	in	the	wall.	He	knew	the	will	of	Allah. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hewad	 took	 the	 soldier’s	 weapon	 and	 boots	 and	 then	 staggered	 to	 his	 feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	toward	the	hole	in	the	wall,	where	the	lightning	had	struck	the	steel window	 grill	 and	 fractured	 much	 of	 the	 poor-quality	 wall.	 He	 hesitated	 briefly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>To	 step	 through	 would	 mean	 death	 if	 he	 was	 captured,	 but	 to	 stay	 would	 be	 to spit	in	the	face	of	Allah’s	mercy.	He	spat	on	the	soldier	instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hewad	stepped	outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a><b class="calibre3">1</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	Emery	smiled	wryly	and	looked	up	from	his	laptop.	He’d	never</p>
<p class="calibre1">faced	 such	 an	 odd	 juxtaposition	 before:	 Aussie	 rock	 blaring	 inside	 an American	 armored	 vehicle	 driving	 through	 the	 Afghan	 desert.	 It	 left him	barely	able	to	think	or	work	as	the	squealing	guitars	threatened	to pierce	the	sound	barrier.	In	his	experience,	it	was	just	how	the	marines	liked	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sound	like	home?”	Lieutenant	Daniel	Ortiz	laughed	as	he	shouted	over	the music.	“I	told	you	bringing	that	thing	along	was	a	waste	of	time!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 set	 the	 laptop	 aside	 and	 had	 to	 raise	 his	 own	 voice	 to	 be	 heard.	 “I thought	I’d	try	to	get	some	work	done!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry	about	that,	buddy!	You	want	to	hang	with	marines	you	have	to	party with	marines!”	Ortiz	grinned	and	then	turned	his	head	to	look	out	the	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	winced	at	the	thought	of	all	the	work	he	had	to	do.	He’d	been	embedded with	the	8th	Marines	for	three	months,	sending	three	reports	a	week	to	EMCorp and	its	affiliates.	It	wasn’t	a	huge	workload,	but	after	so	long	it	was	getting	hard to	 find	 interesting	 things	 to	 write	 about,	 given	 the	 war	 was	 now	 a	 simmering insurgency.	 In	 the	 last	 week	 he’d	 filed	 two	 stories	 about	 US	 troops	 building schools. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	out	the	front	windshield	and	could	see	nothing	but	the	desert	and the	dust	kicked	up	from	the	Humvee	at	the	head	of	the	column.	He	shuffled	back into	the	seat	and	struggled	to	get	comfortable	as	the	music	switched	to	the	next track.	As	a	roaring	drum	solo	kicked	off	the	wailing	electric	guitars,	there	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>massive	explosion	and	the	lead	Humvee	burst	into	a	fireball. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fuck!”	Jack	gripped	his	laptop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“IED!”	Ortiz	had	to	shout	over	the	music. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 the	 Humvee	 ahead	 of	 them	 started	 to	 slow,	 ablaze	 and	 bleeding	 smoke, Jack	 reached	 for	 the	 overhead	 rail	 and	 the	 driver	 braked	 hard.	 The	 vehicle skidded	and	slid	sideways,	the	road	not	giving	the	tires	any	purchase.	The	sound of	 the	 locked	 wheels	 skidding	 across	 the	 dirt	 and	 gravel	 was	 one	 of	 the	 worst Jack	 had	 ever	 heard.	 He	 wasn’t	 a	 religious	 man,	 but	 he	 closed	 his	 eyes	 and prayed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 vehicle	 stopped	 as	 Jack	 opened	 his	 eyes	 and	 reached	 for	 his	 video camera.	He	glanced	right.	The	music	had	stopped	and	Ortiz	had	started	to	bark commands	to	his	unit	over	the	radio.	Jack	looked	left,	over	his	shoulder,	where flames	 licked	 at	 the	 blackened	 husk	 of	 the	 unmoving	 Humvee.	 Nobody	 could have	survived	that	explosion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Talk	to	me!	Any	movement?”	Ortiz’s	voice	was	tense	as	he	spoke	into	the radio. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack’s	 mind	 started	 to	 speed	 up	 again	 as	 the	 other	 vehicles	 in	 the	 convoy reported	no	contacts.	It	was	quite	common	for	the	insurgents	to	hit	a	convoy	with one	 roadside	 bomb,	 but	 there	 had	 also	 been	 instances	 where	 a	 single	 blast	 had been	the	prologue	to	a	greater	assault.	Jack	followed	as	the	marines	climbed	out of	their	vehicles	and	formed	a	perimeter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	felt	instinctively	for	the	‘PRESS’	lettering	that	covered	his	Kevlar	vest as	 he	 followed	 Ortiz	 to	 the	 flamed-out	 Humvee.	 He	 kept	 filming	 as	 he	 drew closer.	 Even	 though	 he	 probably	 wouldn’t	 use	 the	 video,	 he’d	 be	 able	 to	 get some	 stills	 to	 go	 with	 his	 report.	 It	 was	 hard	 to	 believe	 that	 four	 marines	 had probably	been	talking	shit	inside	the	vehicle	just	a	minute	ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fucking	hell.”	Ortiz	spat	in	disgust.	“How	can	you	fight	these	guys?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	kept	silent.	He	doubted	Ortiz	was	addressing	him.	He’d	just	lost	friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	heard	a	shout.	“Hey!	LT!	We’ve	got	a	solo	contact	about	a	mile	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ortiz	 snapped	 instantly	 from	 mourner	 to	 commander	 and	 started	 to	 jog toward	the	marines,	who	were	taking	cover	behind	the	bulk	of	a	Humvee.	Jack followed,	arriving	a	few	seconds	after	Ortiz.	He	took	a	few	deep	breaths,	trying</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>to	stay	calm.	He’d	been	in	combat	plenty,	but	had	never	been	on	the	end	of	an IED	attack.	There	was	a	particular	type	of	fear	reserved	for	an	enemy	that	you couldn’t	see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Report.”	Ortiz’s	voice	had	an	edge	that	Jack	hadn’t	heard	before.	He’d	just lost	a	quarter	of	his	convoy	in	the	blink	of	an	eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	marine	who’d	reported	the	contact	lowered	his	binoculars,	handed	them to	Ortiz	and	pointed	out	into	the	desert. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	squinted.	Though	he	thought	he	could	see	an	individual	drawing	closer, he	 knew	 the	 desert	 played	 tricks	 on	 the	 eye.	 His	 heart	 pounded.	 He	 wanted desperately	for	it	to	be	a	lone	individual	and	not	a	Taliban	or	Al	Qaeda	attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	didn’t	fancy	being	in	the	middle	of	a	firefight	this	far	from	friendly	backup. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	kept	filming	as	the	unidentified	man	drew	closer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	 guy,	 hands	 in	 the	 air	 and	 with	 no	 visible	 weaponry.”	 Ortiz	 exhaled loudly	through	his	nose.	“What’s	his	game,	I	wonder?	The	bomber?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or	a	suicide	bomber?”	Jack	spoke	before	he’d	realized	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ortiz	shook	his	head.	“Nah,	we	shoot	long	before	they	get	close	enough.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 nodded.	 As	 several	 of	 the	 marines	 kept	 their	 rifles	 trained	 on	 the approaching	 man,	 Jack	 stood	 back	 a	 few	 yards	 and	 watched.	 Ortiz	 stood	 still until	 the	 Afghani	 closed	 to	 within	 fifty	 yards.	 At	 that	 point	 he	 used	 the interpreter	to	order	the	man	to	stop,	take	off	his	outer	garments,	keep	his	hands in	the	air,	and	drop	to	his	knees.	The	man	did	it	all	without	hesitation	or	protest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something	isn’t	right	here,	LT.”	One	of	the	marines	protested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shut	the	fuck	up	and	move	in,	Hills,”	Ortiz	snarled.	“If	I	want	you	to	check your	grandmother’s	Ouija	board	to	make	sure	things	are	safe,	I’ll	be	sure	to	ask.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 followed	 Ortiz	 and	 five	 other	 marines	 as	 they	 approached	 the	 man, leaving	 the	 others	 behind	 to	 guard	 the	 vehicles.	 Despite	 having	 so	 many weapons	 trained	 on	 him,	 the	 man	 said	 nothing	 and	 stayed	 still.	 His	 body	 was covered	in	sores,	scars,	and	bruises.	Once	the	man	had	stripped	the	only	thing	he wore	was	underwear	and	a	pair	of	tan-colored	boots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	your	name?”	Ortiz	waited	for	the	translator	to	finish.	“Did	you	plant the	bomb	that	blew	up	my	vehicle?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	name	is	Hewad.”	The	man’s	voice	was	calm,	even	spiritual,	as	he	spoke</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a><img src="index-12_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">in	his	native	tongue	and	the	translator	gave	it	meaning.	“Yes.	I	did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hewad	what?”	Ortiz	took	a	step	closer.	“I	need	your	surname.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hewad	Ghilzai.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	 Ortiz	 could	 reply,	 the	 marine	 who’d	 been	 pawing	 through	 Ghilzai’s pile	of	clothing	spoke.	“There’s	a	marine	sidearm	here,	LT,	and	those	are	marine boots.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ortiz’s	 gaze	 flicked	 back	 to	 Ghilzai.	 “Where	 did	 you	 get	 the	 boots	 and weapon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Camp	 Navitas.”	 Ghilzai	 smiled.	 “God	 delivered	 them	 to	 me.	 Now	 I	 must go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	kept	filming	as	Ghilzai	tried	to	stand	with	a	smile	on	his	face.	Gunfire roared	all	around	as	the	marines	took	no	chances.	Ghilzai’s	body	slumped	to	the hot	sand,	his	blood	completing	a	horrible	scene.	Jack	filmed	closely	until	Ortiz came	close	and	put	a	hand	on	his	shoulder.	Jack	took	the	cue	and	flicked	off	the camera.	He	had	what	he	needed	and	these	men	had	been	through	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 now?”	 Jack’s	 gaze	 flicked	 back	 and	 forth	 between	 the	 body,	 Ortiz, and	the	other	marines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	go	pay	a	visit.”	The	fury	in	Ortiz’s	eyes	was	matched	by	the	edginess	of his	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly,	Jack	felt	he	might	have	something	to	write	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“AS	 YOU	 CAN	 SEE,	 Mr	 Emery,	 the	 facility	 we’re	 running	 is	 top	 notch.”	 Major Brad	 Brinson	 waved	 a	 hand	 out	 over	 the	 yard	 where,	 on	 the	 other	 side	 of	 the chain	 link	 fence,	 inmates	 were	 playing	 soccer	 or	 chatting	 in	 small	 groups.	 “I trust	your	story	will	say	as	much?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 ignored	 the	 threat	 in	 Brinson’s	 words.	 Any	 journalist	 worth	 their	 salt was	subject	to	threats,	bribes,	intimidations,	and	warnings	on	a	weekly	basis.	He couldn’t	 help	 but	 think	 that	 Brinson	 was	 feeding	 him	 horse	 shit.	 He	 shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	Press	Corps	will	have	right	of	refusal,	as	always.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brinson	 frowned	 but	 said	 nothing.	 He	 turned	 away	 and	 resumed	 the	 walk</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>along	the	path,	where	marines	armed	with	rifles	kept	watch	over	matters.	On	the surface,	 Jack	 had	 to	 admit	 that	 the	 facility	 looked	 fine:	 well	 run,	 adequately staffed,	and	with	inmates	cared	for	in	basic	but	suitable	conditions.	But	deep	in his	gut	he	felt	like	it	didn’t	stack	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 Ortiz	 had	 radioed	 the	 attack	 in,	 they’d	 waited	 for	 a	 few	 hours	 for	 a relief	convoy	to	arrive	to	take	care	of	the	cleanup.	The	delay	had	given	Ortiz	and the	 other	 marines	 some	 time	 to	 grieve	 and	 to	 think	 through	 the	 shooting	 of Hewad	 Ghilzai.	 That	 time	 hadn’t	 provided	 clarity,	 however.	 Jack	 was	 still confused	about	those	chaotic	five	minutes.	He	couldn’t	understand	it,	but	knew there	was	a	story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While	 Jack	 had	 never	 heard	 of	 Camp	 Navitas,	 Ortiz	 had	 told	 him	 it	 was	 a small	marine	outpost	in	Helmand	Province	that	doubled	as	a	small	prison.	While they	waited	for	the	cleanup	crew,	Ortiz	had	made	a	request	on	Jack’s	behalf	and approval	had	been	granted.	They’d	arrived	and	been	greeted	by	Brinson.	After	a quick	tour,	the	major	clearly	expected	them	to	leave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	one	more	question,	if	you’ll	indulge	me?”	Jack	pushed	his	luck.	He’d only	get	once	chance.	“Tell	me	about	Hewad	Ghilzai.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Major	 Brinson	 stiffened.	 “Not	 much	 to	 tell.	 The	 little	 shit	 got	 lucky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lightning	struck	the	bars	of	his	cell	a	few	weeks	back.	The	shockwave	took	out one	of	my	men	and	weakened	the	wall.	He	grabbed	a	weapon	and	made	a	run	for it.	Given	how	many	of	our	boys	he’s	responsible	for	killing,	I’m	glad	he’s	dead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 wasn’t	 satisfied	 with	 the	 explanation	 or	 the	 tour.	 He	 wanted	 to	 know more	and	to	see	more.	He	looked	at	his	watch.	“Gee,	it’s	getting	late.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brinson	smiled	like	a	mouse	that’d	triggered	the	trap	but	made	off	with	the cheese.	“You	guys	better	be	off.	Don’t	worry,	there’s	not	much	else	to	see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 hesitated.	 He	 looked	 over	 to	 Ortiz,	 who	 stood	 off	 to	 the	 side	 with	 his hands	in	his	pockets	and	his	eyes	hidden	behind	sunglasses.	A	slight	raise	of	the eyebrow	was	the	only	sign	Jack	gave	to	Ortiz	that	he	was	after	some	support.	He turned	 back	 to	 Brinson	 and	 was	 about	 to	 speak	 when	 Ortiz	 spat	 on	 the	 ground and	stepped	forward	to	join	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Too	late	to	move	out	now.”	Ortiz	looked	up	at	the	sky	and	rubbed	his	chin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	too	far	back	to	Leatherneck.	We’ll	need	to	billet	here	until	dawn,	Major.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a><img src="index-14_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 smile	 vanished	 from	 Brinson’s	 face.	 He	 glared	 at	 Jack,	 Ortiz,	 and	 the other	 two	 marines	 as	 if	 they	 were	 annoyances.	 “Impossible,	 we	 don’t	 have room.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 hear	 a	 space	 has	 just	 opened	 up,	 Major.”	 Jack	 smiled.	 “One	 of	 your prisoners	was	shot	dead	a	few	hours	from	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brinson	glared.	“I	don’t	appreciate	–	” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ortiz	 sighed.	 “Do	 I	 need	 to	 get	 the	 colonel	 on	 the	 line?	 It’s	 104	 degrees, major,	and	the	orders	were	clear:	every	possible	courtesy	and	all	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	out	of	line,	Lieutenant.”	Brinson’s	voice	had	menace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	tapped	his	tape	recorder,	which	was	still	going.	“It	would	let	me	start	on the	story	and	I	could	give	you	a	look	before	we	head	off	tomorrow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brinson’s	 eyes	 narrowed.	 He	 was	 clearly	 weighing	 up	 something	 and	 Jack wondered	again	what	he	had	to	hide.	To	have	the	chance	to	find	out,	Jack	had	to hope	 the	 potential	 to	 shape	 his	 story	 and	 the	 threat	 of	 escalation	 to	 Colonel Williams	would	overcome	Brinson’s	displeasure	at	the	idea	of	them	staying.	Jack needed	time	to	snoop	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.”	Brinson	nodded.	“But	I	hope	you	like	bunk	beds,	Mr	Emery.	One	of my	guys	will	sort	you	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ortiz	saluted	and	waited	as	Brinson	returned	it	lazily	and	then	stalked	off.	As they	waited	to	be	told	where	to	go,	Jack	and	Ortiz	leaned	against	the	chain	link fence	 and	 watched	 the	 inmates	 play.	 Jack	 looped	 his	 hands	 through	 the	 fence, and	 then	 winced	 as	 he	 cut	 himself	 on	 a	 rough	 strip.	 He	 looked	 down	 and	 saw blood	and	then	glanced	up	at	the	inmates.	It	struck	him	then	how	many	had	scars and	bruises. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	hope	you	know	what	you’re	doing,	Jack.”	Ortiz	spoke	softly.	“I’m	going to	be	in	a	shit	ton	of	trouble	with	the	colonel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	grinned.	“This	is	what	I	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">JACK	 PRESSED	 AGAINST	 THE	 WALL,	 hoping	 that	 the	 cold	 stone	 might	 somehow hide	 him	 from	 the	 beam	 of	 light	 that	 snaked	 towards	 him,	 left	 and	 right,	 ever</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>closer	as	a	marine	approached	with	a	flashlight.	After	all	of	his	effort	to	stay	at Camp	Navitas	overnight,	he’d	barely	made	it	out	of	his	room	and	now	it	looked like	the	gig	was	up.	Ortiz	wouldn’t	be	impressed	if	Jack	was	busted,	nor	would Jack’s	editor.	He	took	a	deep	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	Mike!”	a	voice	shouted.	“Major	Brinson	wants	you	posted	outside	the journalist’s	door.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 closed	 his	 eyes.	 He	 hoped	 the	 new	 voice	 was	 calling	 out	 to	 the	 guy holding	the	torch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 rostered	 on	 to	 B	 wing.”	 Another	 man,	 closer	 to	 Jack,	 called	 back	 and then	let	out	a	long	sigh.	“I	wish	he’d	make	up	his	mind.	Who’s	taking	over	from me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nobody.	Now	get	moving.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack’s	 eyes	 shot	 open	 and	 locked	 onto	 the	 beam	 of	 light.	 It	 had	 stopped moving	towards	him.	He	heard	another	sigh	and	then	watched	as	the	light	shifted direction.	 The	 marine’s	 boots	 gave	 dull	 thuds	 as	 he	 walked	 away,	 the	 sound growing	fainter	with	each	footstep.	Finally,	after	going	so	close	to	being	exposed by	the	guards,	Jack	was	alone	in	the	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 took	 a	 couple	 of	 deep	 breaths	 and	 then	 pushed	 himself	 off	 the	 wall.	 He stuck	his	head	around	the	corner	and	then	moved	down	the	hallway	as	quietly	as he	could.	At	the	end	of	the	corridor	he	turned	left	and	made	his	way	toward	one of	 the	 three	 detention	 blocks	 he’d	 been	 walked	 past	 but	 not	 allowed	 to	 enter when	 Brinson	 had	 given	 them	 the	 tour.	 Brinson	 had	 told	 him	 that	 each	 block housed	twelve	detainees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 reached	 the	 heavy	 steel	 door	 that	 barred	 the	 way	 into	 the	 cell	 block. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Luckily,	it	was	more	focused	on	keeping	inmates	in	than	snooping	reporters	out, meaning	he	could	open	it	with	the	turn	of	a	handle.	He	walked	inside	and	closed the	 door	 behind	 him.	 No	 guards	 were	 posted	 inside,	 but	 there	 was	 always	 a chance	one	would	happen	along.	Whatever	he	was	hoping	to	find,	he	had	to	find it	quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	light	on	his	cell	phone	was	all	Jack	could	use	to	search.	It	was	hard	to get	used	to	walking	around	in	the	dark,	but	many	American	firebases	and	camps on	the	fringe	of	insurgent	territory	went	dark	at	night.	Navitas	was	no	different. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>As	he	walked	deeper	into	the	cell	block,	the	smell	was	the	first	thing	he	noticed, followed	 by	 the	 cries	 and	 whimpers	 of	 broken	 men	 from	 behind	 simple	 but effective	grilled	steel	cell	doors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	hesitated	and	then	decided	that	if	he	was	going	to	trespass	he	may	as	well go	the	whole	hog.	“Hello?	Does	anyone	speak	English?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 met	 with	 silence,	 though	 the	 whimpering	 stopped.	 He	 tried	 again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	an	Australian	reporter.	I’d	like	to	talk	about	Hewad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stood	still	as	some	of	the	inmates	chatted	amongst	themselves	in	Pashto or	Dari	–	Jack	wasn’t	sure	which.	It	was	a	long	shot	that	any	of	them	would	be able	to	understand	him,	know	Ghilzai,	and	be	willing	to	speak	with	him,	but	he had	 to	 try.	 The	 alternative	 was	 to	 search	 aimlessly	 through	 the	 camp	 and	 risk getting	caught	with	no	guarantee	of	a	story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 chattering	 increased	 and,	 finally,	 one	 of	 the	 Afghans	 approached	 the door	 to	 his	 cell.	 He	 gripped	 the	 bars	 with	 his	 hands	 and	 spoke.	 “You	 know Hewad?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	flashed	the	light	towards	the	man.	“I	met	him.	He’s	dead	now.	He	blew up	an	American	vehicle	and	they	shot	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Trust	him	to	do	something	like	that.”	The	detainee’s	English	was	patchy,	but good	enough	to	understand.	“We	thought	he	was	crazy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack’s	 mind	 started	 to	 fire,	 but	 he	 kept	 calm.	 The	 surest	 way	 to	 scare	 off	 a source	was	to	jump	too	excitedly	at	a	lead.	“You	knew	him	well?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 other	 man	 laughed	 and	 then	 suppressed	 it,	 as	 if	 he’d	 momentarily forgotten	 where	 he	 was.	 The	 few	 teeth	 he	 had	 left	 were	 rotten.	 “I	 should.	 He married	my	sister.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 smiled.	 He	 shouldn’t	 take	 a	 liking	 to	 the	 man,	 but	 it	 was	 hard	 not	 to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hewad	had	American	boots	and	a	weapon.	He	told	me	if	I	came	here	I’d	find answers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	prisoner	laughed.	He	took	a	step	back,	pulled	his	tattered	shirt	over	his head,	and	turned	around.	Even	in	the	pale	light	offered	by	the	phone,	Jack	could see	fresh	wounds	alongside	scars.	He	could	see	welts	and	burns,	angry	and	red, and	 bruises	 as	 dark	 as	 the	 night.	 The	 man’s	 whole	 body	 was	 broken	 and wounded.	Jack	had	seen	combat	injuries	before,	and	these	weren’t	that.	This	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>something	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	 long	 have	 you	 been	 here?”	 Jack	 kept	 his	 voice	 low,	 feeling	 as	 if	 the man’s	revelations	made	his	snooping	even	riskier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 prisoner	 shrugged.	 “Many	 months.	 Nearly	 a	 year.	 Who	 knows?	 I’ve been	here	the	longest	though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So	the	wounds	could	only	have	been	caused	by	one	thing.	“And	they	mistreat you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	 shrug.	 “They	 do	 what	 they	 do.	 To	 me	 and	 everyone	 else	 until	 we die.	Except	Hewad.	He	was	the	most	devout.	God	freed	him	and	he	struck	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	mind	if	I	take	some	photographs?	I’ll	report	this	to	the	world.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	what	you	want.	I’m	a	dead	man	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	spent	a	few	moments	photographing	the	man’s	injuries	with	his	phone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	shots	weren’t	great,	but	they’d	suffice.	Jack	was	surprised	when	the	prisoner called	out	to	other	detainees	to	show	him	their	wounds.	He	gathered	dozens	of photographs	of	the	nine	men	before	deciding	he’d	pushed	his	luck	–	and	that	of the	prisoners	–	far	enough.	He	noted	down	the	names	of	each	prisoner	and	then moved	to	leave	the	cell	block. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On	 a	 whim	 he	 paused	 and	 turned	 back	 to	 the	 prisoner	 who	 spoke	 English, still	standing	at	the	bars	of	his	cell.	“Which	cell	belonged	to	Hewad?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	pointed.	Jack	walked	over	and	flashed	his	light	inside	the	cell.	Not surprisingly,	 it	 was	 empty,	 though	 there	 was	 an	 enormous	 bloodstain	 on	 the sandy	floor	of	the	cell.	He	looked	up	and	saw	clearly	how	Hewad	had	escaped, through	the	giant	hole	in	the	wall.	He	took	some	more	snaps	and	started	to	piece it	together	in	his	head.	Camp	Navitas	was	a	giant	torture	chamber. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	risked	enough	and	had	enough	for	a	story.	There	was	nothing	else	to	be gained,	 but	 plenty	 to	 be	 lost	 by	 sticking	 around.	 With	 one	 final	 glance	 at	 the prisoners	 he	 cut	 the	 light	 on	 his	 phone,	 left	 the	 cellblock,	 and	 then	 snuck	 back toward	 his	 room.	 No	 marines	 interrupted	 his	 journey,	 though	 Jack	 did	 pause around	the	corner	from	his	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 pulled	 the	 phone	 out	 of	 his	 pocket	 and	 undid	 the	 button	 on	 his	 brown chinos.	 Within	 a	 few	 seconds,	 he	 had	 the	 phone	 in	 between	 his	 ass	 cheeks.	 It wasn’t	the	nicest	part	of	his	job,	but	if	Brinson	was	worried	enough	about	what</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>was	hidden	in	his	facility	to	put	a	guard	on	Jack’s	door,	then	there	was	a	chance they’d	search	him.	He	turned	the	corner	and	approached	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	marine	on	the	door	nearly	had	a	kitten	when	he	saw	Jack	walking	toward him.	His	flashlight	switched	on	and	pointed	at	Jack.	“I	hope	you	can	explain	this, sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	smiled	and	raised	his	hands	in	the	air,	trying	to	lighten	the	mood.	“Just ducked	out	for	a	walk.	Sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve	been	here	for	thirty	minutes,	sir.”	The	marine	didn’t	sound	convinced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	believe	the	major	was	clear	about	the	rules	of	you	staying	here	overnight.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	 Australian,	 mate.	 Rules	 are	 optional	 for	 us.”	 Jack	 laughed	 and	 patted the	marine	on	the	shoulder.	“What	he	doesn’t	know	won’t	hurt	him,	will	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	marine	sighed.	“I’ll	need	to	search	you	quickly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	clenched	his	cheeks.	He	doubted	the	guard	would	look	too	closely. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a><b class="calibre3">2</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	departure	from	Navitas	hadn’t	gone	as	Jack	had	expected.	Major</p>
<p class="calibre1">Brinson	 hadn’t	 even	 been	 there	 when,	 early	 in	 the	 morning,	 Jack	 had climbed	into	the	Humvee	with	Ortiz	and	the	other	marines	and	set	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 Camp	 Leatherneck.	 He’d	 expected	 bluster	 from	 Brinson	 –	 threats	 about	 his story	and	chastisement	for	wandering	from	his	room.	Instead,	he’d	been	given	a sandwich. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	 did	 you	 get	 anything	 worthwhile?”	 Ortiz	 shook	 his	 head	 as	 they	 raced along	the	road.	“Those	were	some	cranky	motherfuckers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 looked	 up	 from	 his	 laptop.	 Tellingly,	 the	 other	 two	 marines	 in	 the vehicle	 were	 nodding	 at	 Ortiz’s	 words.	 They	 knew	 something	 was	 up.	 “Well, I…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ortiz	 interrupted	 and	 pointed	 to	 the	 driver	 and	 front	 seat	 passenger.	 “If you’re	worried	about	these	two,	don’t	be.	They’ve	been	through	hell	with	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 still	 hesitated.	 The	 story	 he	 was	 writing	 to	 go	 with	 the	 pictures	 he’d taken	would	rock	America	and	the	Marine	Corps.	Though	allegations	of	torture had	 surrounded	 the	 CIA	 for	 years	 following	 September	 11,	 the	 military	 had mostly	kept	its	hands	clean	with	the	exception	of	Abu	Ghraib.	From	what	Jack had	seen,	this	was	as	bad	–	systematic	and	at	scale.	It	angered	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	knew	that	the	minute	he	spoke	about	the	story	it	would	take	on	a	life	of its	 own.	 Though	 he’d	 spent	 the	 last	 few	 months	 embedded	 with	 Ortiz	 and	 his troops,	and	he	was	confident	that	most	men	and	women	in	uniform	would	be	as</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>appalled	as	he	was	by	the	torture,	there	was	no	guarantee.	Jack	closed	his	eyes, reached	 up,	 and	 scratched	 his	 forehead.	 He	 opened	 his	 eyes	 and	 Ortiz	 was staring	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,	 Jack.”	 Ortiz’s	 gaze	 didn’t	 waver.	 “Whatever	 happened	 at	 that	 camp contributed	to	the	death	of	four	of	my	men.	Shit	happens	in	war,	but	if	someone screwed	up	I	want	to	know	before	you	put	it	on	the	front	page	of	the	 <i class="calibre4">Standard. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.”	 Jack	 sighed.	 Suddenly,	 he	 felt	 bad	 for	 questioning	 these	 men. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’d	 welcomed	 him,	 protected	 him,	 and	 shown	 him	 around	 the	 country	 for months.	He	handed	the	laptop	to	Ortiz.	“Check	it	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 watched	 as	 Ortiz	 took	 the	 computer	 and	 worked	 his	 way	 through	 the story.	The	marine’s	facial	expression	shifted	from	curious	to	concerned	to	angry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	 the	 time	 he	 reached	 the	 end	 of	 the	 story	 he’d	 seen	 Jack’s	 claims	 and	 the photos	 that	 backed	 them	 up	 –	 the	 beatings,	 the	 burnings,	 the	 electrocution,	 the rectal	abuse.	The	detainees	hadn’t	held	back	and	neither	had	Jack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fuck.”	 Ortiz	 handed	 the	 laptop	 to	 the	 marine	 in	 the	 front	 seat.	 “I	 thought we’d	learned	from	Iraq.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s	an	important	story.”	Jack	shrugged.	“But	it’s	going	to	cause	a	firestorm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ll	keep	your	names	out	of	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ortiz	grunted.	He	seemed	satisfied	by	Jack’s	concession,	given	nobody	in	the Humvee	was	guilty	of	anything.	It	was	only	by	sheer	chance	that	they’d	been	the patrol	to	trigger	Ghilzai’s	bomb	and	then	been	able	to	question	the	man	enough to	get	a	lead	before	he’d	been	shot.	What	shocked	Jack	most	of	all	was	the	scale of	 the	 abuse	 at	 Navitas	 –	 at	 least	 thirty	 detainees	 and	 a	 dozen	 marines	 were involved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 driver	 interrupted	 Jack’s	 thoughts.	 “Hey,	 LT?	 We’ve	 got	 company.	 A couple	of	ANA	hummers	and	a	truck.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 was	 confused	 about	 why	 an	 Afghan	 National	 Army	 convoy	 would	 be tailing	 them.	 Ortiz	 and	 the	 driver	 shared	 a	 look	 in	 the	 rear	 vision	 mirror,	 after which	 the	 Humvee	 started	 to	 speed	 up.	 Clearly	 the	 marines	 were	 nervous	 too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever	beef	the	Afghans	had	could	be	sorted	once	they	reached	Leatherneck and	were	safely	under	the	watchful	eye	of	a	few	hundred	US	guns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ortiz	picked	up	the	radio	receiver.	“Lizard	Four	calling	Leatherneck	Actual.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>As	he	listened	in	and	waited	for	a	reply,	Jack	turned	around	in	his	seat	and peered	 out	 the	 back	 window.	 Their	 pursuers	 were	 definitely	 gunning	 their engines	to	catch	up,	leaving	a	cloud	of	dust	in	their	wake.	He	turned	back	around in	his	seat.	The	other	marines	were	tense,	readying	their	rifles	as	they	waited	for the	response	over	the	radio. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	radio	crackled.	“Lizard	Four,	this	is	Leatherneck	Actual,	report.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re	 en	 route	 from	 Camp	 Navitas	 to	 Camp	 Leatherneck	 and	 we’ve	 got ANA	vehicles	riding	our	six	pretty	hard.”	Ortiz	paused.	“Was	it	scheduled?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Standby,	Lizard	Four.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 grabbed	 his	 laptop	 from	 the	 marine	 in	 the	 front	 seat.	 He	 had	 a	 feeling that	things	were	about	to	go	south	as	he	plugged	in	the	satellite	internet	dongle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he	 waited	 for	 it	 to	 connect,	 he	 looked	 behind	 them	 again.	 The	 convoy	 was closing	even	though	the	driver	of	the	Humvee	had	stepped	on	the	gas.	He	turned to	the	front	and	saw	a	speck	in	the	distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s	that?”	Jack	pointed.	It	looked	like	a	tank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ortiz	looked	up	from	his	weapon.	His	eyes	widened.	“It’s	an	old	T-62.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	driver	laughed.	“It’s	a	museum	piece,	LT.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ortiz	wasn’t	amused.	“It’s	still	got	enough	to	split	us	open	like	a	melon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 inched	 forward	 in	 his	 seat.	 “They	 want	 us	 to	 stop.	 They	 want	 my photographs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 radio	 crackled	 again.	 “Lizard	 Four,	 ANA	 liaison	 reports	 no	 vehicle convoys	within	fifty	miles	of	you	at	this	time.	Act	at	your	discretion.	Over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ortiz’s	eyes	narrowed	and	he	cussed.	It	was	the	first	time	Jack	had	felt	scared in	 his	 marrow	 since	 being	 in	 Afghanistan.	 Through	 all	 the	 firefights,	 incidents and	even	the	explosion	of	the	IED	he’d	been	in	friendly	hands.	Being	surrounded by	 a	 whole	 lot	 of	 marines	 was	 like	 a	 condom	 for	 an	 embedded	 reporter.	 It	 felt good	to	know	you’re	covered.	This	situation	felt	a	bit	more	precarious	though. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re	getting	closer!”	The	driver	looked	back	in	the	mirror.	“What	do	you want	to	do,	LT?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pull	us	over.	Whatever	is	about	to	happen,	I’d	rather	do	it	away	from	that tank.”	Ortiz	turned	to	Jack.	“Whatever	you’re	doing,	you’ve	got	thirty	seconds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	nodded	and	looked	back	at	his	machine.	He	tried	not	to	think	about	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a><img src="index-22_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">approaching	 convoy	 and	 focused	 on	 uploading	 some	 of	 the	 more	 significant photos	to	his	Dropbox	account.	He	also	uploaded	the	story	he’d	been	writing.	As the	 Humvee	 slowed	 and	 then	 stopped	 and	 the	 convoy	 pulled	 to	 a	 stop	 behind them,	the	upload	finished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Done!”	 Jack	 cleared	 his	 browser	 cache,	 deleted	 the	 photos	 and	 documents from	 his	 hard	 drive	 and	 then	 yanked	 out	 the	 satellite	 dongle.	 He	 threw	 the camera	SD	card	and	the	dongle	underneath	the	seat.	“What	now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ortiz	 climbed	 out	 under	 the	 watchful	 guns	 of	 the	 ANA	 troops	 who’d surrounded	 the	 vehicle.	 Jack	 couldn’t	 hear	 what	 was	 being	 said,	 but	 there	 was lots	of	pointing	and	gesturing.	The	leader	of	the	Afghan	group	also	seemed	fond of	 waving	 a	 piece	 of	 paper	 in	 Ortiz’s	 face.	 The	 whole	 situation	 was	 an	 open powder	keg	with	a	match	held	over	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually,	 Ortiz	 opened	 the	 door	 with	 a	 look	 of	 fury	 etched	 onto	 his	 face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These	gentlemen	are	taking	you	into	custody.	They	also	need	your	computer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	nodded	and	unbuckled	his	seatbelt.	“What’s	the	charge?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	sorts	of	stuff.	It’s	just	to	scare	you.”	Ortiz	smiled.	“We’re	going	to	tail the	convoy	and	we’ll	be	with	you	all	the	way	to	Lashkar	Gah.	You’ll	be	fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.”	Jack	opened	the	door	and	climbed	out	of	the	vehicle.	He	let	himself be	handcuffed.	He	was	scared,	but	had	no	choice.	“Lead	the	way,	fellas.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">THERE	WASN’T	a	lot	to	be	said	about	the	room	that	Jack	found	himself	in.	He’d sat	 for	 hours	 at	 a	 small	 table,	 swinging	 on	 his	 chair	 and	 thinking	 about	 the defense	 he’d	 have	 to	 mount	 against	 the	 charges.	 Once	 that	 got	 boring,	 he’d simply	stared	at	the	wall.	He’d	been	told	through	a	translator	that	he’d	have	to wait	a	short	while,	but	Rome	had	been	built	quicker	than	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	happy	that	the	images	and	the	start	of	his	story	were	safely	stowed	in his	 Dropbox	 account.	 Whatever	 was	 to	 come,	 they’d	 be	 waiting	 for	 him whenever	he	was	freed.	He	was	also	confident	that	he’d	covered	his	tracks	with the	 computer	 and	 the	 SD	 card	 to	 a	 basic	 level.	 His	 efforts	 wouldn’t	 hold	 up	 to detailed	 forensic	 examination	 of	 his	 computer,	 but	 it	 would	 satisfy	 a	 passing</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>glance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 story	 was	 a	 bombshell	 and	 he	 was	 certain	 that	 neither	 Brinson	 nor	 the ANA	had	any	idea	what	he’d	managed	to	learn.	Short	of	such	an	examination	of his	 computer,	 or	 them	 torturing	 the	 information	 and	 the	 Dropbox	 login	 out	 of him,	it	was	hidden	like	a	dormant	virus	ready	for	him	to	trigger.	He	was	excited by	the	potential	and	was	sure	that	his	editor	would	be	as	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually,	the	steel	door	creaked	open	on	its	hinges.	Jack	turned	his	head	in time	for	the	door	to	hit	the	wall	with	a	loud	bang	as	two	Afghani	men	in	military uniforms	walked	into	the	room.	A	third	man	–	a	Westerner	–	followed	them	in, wearing	 civilian	 clothes	 and	 half-framed	 glasses.	 He	 was	 too	 small	 to	 be military,	which	meant	he	was	either	a	diplomat	or	an	intelligence	officer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without	 a	 word,	 the	 two	 officers	 sat	 in	 the	 chairs	 directly	 opposite	 Jack, while	the	Westerner	sat	to	Jack’s	left.	The	two	military	men	started	to	lay	some papers	 out	 on	 the	 table.	 Jack	 leaned	 forward	 in	 his	 chair,	 ready	 for	 his	 eyes	 to feast	on	what	was	in	front	of	him.	He	wanted	to	learn	what	they	had	and	what they	intended	to	hit	him	with.	He	was	disappointed	that	he	couldn’t	read	any	of it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr	 Emery.”	 The	 officer	 on	 the	 left	 was	 all	 business.	 “I’m	 Major	 Gholem-Ali	 Jafari,	 Afghan	 National	 Army.	 My	 colleague	 is	 Lieutenant	 Doost Mohammad.	We’re	here	to	dissuade	you	from	reporting	on	classified	material.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	said	nothing.	He	wanted	to	figure	out	who	was	the	good	cop	and	who was	 the	 bad	 cop.	 The	 major	 spoke	 excellent	 English	 with	 an	 Oxford	 accent, probably	 the	 brother	 of	 a	 local	 warlord	 parachuted	 into	 a	 position	 of	 authority. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lieutenant	kept	his	face	expressionless.	The	Westerner	was	the	real	mystery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	his	arms	crossed	and	his	eyes	locked	on	Jack.	He	was	the	threat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jafari	 continued.	 “You	 have	 no	 right	 to	 silence	 here.	 You’re	 facing	 serious charges	 and	 if	 you	 find	 yourself	 before	 a	 judge	 you’ll	 spend	 the	 rest	 of	 this decade	in	prison.	I	suggest	you	start	talking,	Mr	Emery.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 didn’t	 beat	 around	 the	 bush	 –	 accusations	 and	 the	 threat	 of	 long-term incarceration.	Jack	turned	to	the	Westerner.	“Who’re	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	name	is	Sonny	Vacaro.”	The	Westerner	spoke	with	a	southern	drawl	as he	tapped	his	thumbs	on	the	table.	“I	just	–	” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>“Where	are	you	from,	Sonny	Vacaro?”	Jack	wasn’t	sure	interrupting	was	the best	idea,	but	he	had	to	get	something	of	a	handle	on	the	situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alabama.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	persisted.	“And	your	professional	home?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Classified.”	Vacaro	smiled	like	a	shark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right.”	Jack	sighed.	‘Your	name	isn’t	Sonny	Vacaro,	either.’</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Classified.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	snorted.	“Right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,	 Jack.”	 Vacaro	 uncrossed	 his	 arms	 and	 leaned	 forward.	 “We’re	 the only	 thing	 keeping	 you	 from	 an	 Afghan	 prison	 cell	 with	 a	 dirt	 floor	 and	 pit latrine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.”	 Jack	 swallowed	 hard,	 trying	 to	 resist	 the	 urge	 to	 press	 Vacaro’s buttons	further.	“I’ve	done	nothing	wrong.	Ask	what	you	want.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	 we’re	 getting	 somewhere.”	 Vacaro	 waved	 a	 hand	 lazily	 towards	 the documents	 on	 the	 table.	 “A	 number	 of	 Taliban	 and	 Al	 Qaeda	 prisoners	 have confessed	 that	 you	 recorded	 their	 lies	 and	 took	 photos	 of	 some	 of	 the	 injuries they	suffered	prior	to	capture.	I’m	concerned	you	have	the	wrong	picture,	Jack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 scoffed.	 The	 ANA	 officers	 and	 Vacaro	 were	 throwing	 around	 threats like	candy	and	there	were	some	documents	he	couldn’t	read	on	the	table.	He’d had	tougher	shits	than	this	and	he’d	heard	more	compelling	narrative	out	of	 <i class="calibre4">New</i> <i class="calibre4">York	Standard	</i> interns.	It	was	time	to	test	what	they	knew,	what	they	suspected, and	what	they	had	no	idea	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,	this	feels	a	bit	like	amateur	hour	at	the	Comedy	Club.”	Jack	reached up	and	ran	a	hand	through	his	hair.	“I	don’t	 <i class="calibre4">have	</i> a	story,	so	you’ll	need	to	piece it	together	for	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vacaro	bit	his	lip	as	if	lost	in	thought.	After	a	moment	he	nodded	and	spoke again.	“Did	you	record	a	conversation	with	Hewad	Ghilzai	when	he	was	under guard	by	members	of	the	8th	Marines?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,	the	recording	is	on	my	computer,	which	you	have.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vacaro	 nodded,	 shared	 a	 look	 with	 the	 ANA	 officers,	 and	 then	 continued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.	Now,	did	that	conversation	lead	you	to	Camp	Navitas	where,	after	a	tour from	Major	Bradley	Brinson,	you	arranged	to	stay	the	night	on	a	thin	pretext?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>“I’d	dispute	that	–	” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jafari	cut	in.	“You	then	snuck	around	the	camp	and	spoke	to	nine	dangerous criminals	and	terrorists.	They	fed	you	lies	and	you	also	took	photographs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vacaro	didn’t	seem	thrilled	with	the	interruption.	He	glared	at	Jafari	and	then turned	 to	 Jack.	 “I	 think	 what	 my	 colleague	 here	 is	 trying	 to	 say	 is	 that,	 in	 a vacuum,	 whatever	 you	 heard	 there	 may	 sound	 damning.	 But	 you	 need	 to	 be careful	here,	Jack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 smiled.	 “I’d	 dispute	 that	 too.	 The	 only	 thing	 you’ll	 find	 in	 my possession	 is	 a	 recording	 of	 my	 discussion	 with	 Ghilzai.	 I	 have	 no	 testimony from	any	prisoners	and	I	have	no	photos.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vacaro	sighed.	“You’re	not	an	American,	Jack.	If	you	were	you’d	have	more protection	in	this	room.	I	don’t	care	if	you	trespassed.	I	don’t	care	if	you	spoke to	some	Afghans.	I	do	care	if	you’re	going	to	parlay	those	facts	into	damaging lies.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 inched	 forward	 in	 his	 seat	 and	 placed	 his	 hands,	 palms	 down,	 on	 the table.	He	glanced	in	the	direction	of	each	man	for	a	few	seconds,	using	the	time to	 collect	 his	 thoughts.	 This	 was	 the	 crossroads:	 he	 could	 deny	 everything	 or come	 clean	 and	 promise	 to	 keep	 quiet.	 Both	 options	 had	 risks,	 but	 despite	 his unease	there	was	only	one	choice	for	him	to	make.	He	was	a	news	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	smiled.	“No	comment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	sure	you	want	to	walk	down	this	path?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 shrugged,	 despite	 the	 tinge	 of	 doubt	 he	 felt.	 “I’m	 a	 pretty	 well-known reporter	 who	 works	 for	 the	 largest	 media	 conglomerate	 on	 the	 planet.	 Are	 you sure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very	well.	We’ll	see	if	a	few	days	in	that	prison	I	mentioned	changes	your mind.	I	don’t	care	about	you,	Jack,	but	I	can’t	have	you	reporting	falsehoods.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 sat	 back	 as	 Vacaro	 nodded	 at	 the	 lieutenant,	 who	 appeared	 to	 be	 little more	than	a	prop.	The	junior	officer	stood,	walked	towards	the	door,	and	bashed on	it	twice	with	his	fist.	The	heavy	sound	rang	out	like	the	death	knell	on	Jack’s freedom.	He	was	fearful	of	what	was	to	come,	but	he	couldn’t	abandon	this	story so	easily,	especially	after	the	interest	Vacaro	had	shown	in	burying	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	swung	open	and	two	uniformed	ANA	soldiers	stepped	in,	joined	by</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a><img src="index-26_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">a	pair	of	marines.	Jack’s	eyes	widened.	It	was	a	surprise	to	see	the	two	militaries working	so	closely	together	to	bust	this	story	out	of	him.	As	they	walked	closer, stood	 him	 up,	 and	 cuffed	 him,	 he	 felt	 like	 he	 was	 floating	 above	 his	 body.	 His mind	 started	 to	 recalibrate.	 This	 was	 more	 than	 Brinson	 and	 some	 dodgy marines. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	was	big. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JACK’S	 THROAT	 felt	 as	 if	 it	 was	 tearing	 open	 as	 he	 screamed	 out	 in	 agony.	 He tried	to	pull	his	hand	back,	to	protect	it,	but	the	restraints	kept	it	where	it	was	–</p>
<p class="calibre1">flat	on	the	table	and	palm	up,	an	easy	target	for	the	rod	that	had	just	come	down on	it	hard	and	sent	fire	burning	up	his	arm.	He	bucked	against	the	chair,	trying	to free	himself	and	screaming	insults	at	his	captors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	nostrils	flared	and	his	eyes	blinked	quickly	as	the	pain	receded.	His	hair was	soaked	with	sweat	and	stuck	to	his	forehead.	Rivulets	of	sweat	rolled	down his	face,	stung	his	eyes,	and	filled	his	mouth	with	salty	moisture	that	seemed	to mock	 his	 thirst.	 He	 wanted	 to	 see	 them,	 but	 a	 hood	 covered	 his	 head.	 They waited	for	the	answer.	Sure	as	death	they’d	ask	it	again	in	a	minute,	he	wouldn’t answer,	they’d	hit	him	and	ask	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Best	 he	 could	 tell,	 he’d	 been	 in	 their	 custody	 for	 nearly	 two	 days,	 and	 the attention	they’d	given	him	was	a	painful	exclamation	point	on	the	interview	with Vacaro	and	the	ANA	officers.	Their	treatment	had	been	harsh	and	had	left	him	in no	 doubt	 that	 they	 wanted	 him	 to	 give	 them	 everything	 he	 knew.	 He	 was determined	not	to	tell	them	about	the	Dropbox	dump. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	had	been	easy	to	handle	at	first	–	no	food	and	little	sleep.	Every	time	he’d started	to	doze	off,	they’d	beam	the	lights	down	on	him.	That	had	graduated	to not	being	able	to	use	the	bathroom	and,	when	that	had	failed	to	garner	answers from	him,	they’d	started	to	hurt	him.	Fists	and	boots,	followed	by	the	rod.	He’d had	 enough	 already	 and	 it	 had	 barely	 started.	 He	 wondered	 how	 any	 of	 the Afghan	prisoners	took	much	more	than	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	 American	 voice	 punctuated	 his	 thoughts	 and	 his	 pain.	 “Tell	 us	 how	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>access	the	photographs	you	took	and	this	all	ends,	Jack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 head	 slumped.	 He	 didn’t	 want	 to	 tell	 them	 about	 the	 photos,	 but	 he couldn’t	endure	this.	He	hadn’t	filed	the	story	and	he	didn’t	have	any	sources	to protect.	The	only	thing	he	had	to	lose	was	a	good	story,	but	it	wasn’t	worth	his freedom	or	his	life.	He	wanted	to	hold	out	but	they’d	break	him	eventually.	From what	he’d	seen	in	the	cells	at	Navitas,	there	was	a	lot	worse	to	come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	feel	like	you	want	to	tell	me	something,	Jack.”	The	voice	persisted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	raised	his	head.	“I	–	” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 was	 interrupted	 by	 pounding	 against	 the	 interrogation	 room	 door.	 He jerked	his	head	toward	it,	even	though	he	couldn’t	see	anything	from	underneath the	 hood.	 He	 heard	 a	 deep	 sigh	 from	 one	 of	 his	 interrogators	 and	 then	 the clicking	sound	of	boots	on	the	concrete	floor.	Jack	didn’t	think	much	of	it	until he	heard	several	low,	angry	voices	speaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 couldn’t	 hear	 what	 was	 being	 said,	 though	 the	 anger	 of	 his	 interrogator was	clear.	He	shook	his	head	and	clamped	his	teeth	together,	determined	now	to hold	out	after	his	moment	of	weakness	and	his	near	betrayal	of	the	photos	and the	story.	After	a	few	moments	of	back	and	forth	conversation	near	the	door,	the voices	grew	louder	and	several	new	footsteps	could	be	heard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 light	 burned	 Jack’s	 eyes	 and	 he	 squeezed	 them	 shut	 as	 the	 hood	 was pulled	off	his	head.	His	mind	screamed	with	confusion.	He	could	hear	voices	but couldn’t	 process	 what	 they	 were	 saying,	 until	 slowly	 everything	 returned	 to normal	 and	 he	 started	 to	 regain	 his	 senses.	 He	 opened	 his	 eyes	 and	 looked around,	confused	by	the	five	men	who	surrounded	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	only	man	not	wearing	a	military	uniform	spoke.	“Mr	Emery,	my	name	is Keith	Baird,	I’m	a	staffer	at	the	Australian	Embassy	in	Kabul.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	blinked	a	couple	of	times	and	tried	to	lift	his	hands,	but	they	were	still bound	on	the	table.	“What	do	you	want?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	want	you,	actually.”	Baird	smiled	sadly.	“I’m	just	sorry	it	took	me	so	long to	hear	about	your…	predicament.	Sorrier	still	it	took	me	so	long	to	get	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Baird	 waved	 a	 piece	 of	 paper	 at	 the	 soldiers.	 “This	 is	 an	 order	 from	 the Afghan	Justice	Minister	ordering	you	to	release	this	man	into	my	custody.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	 like	 that,	 Jack	 nearly	 cried	 as	 the	 four	 military	 men	 –	 three	 American</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>and	 one	 Afghani	 –	 worked	 to	 free	 him	 from	 his	 restraints.	 He	 didn’t	 get	 his hopes	up	until	his	hands	were	free.	He	felt	his	wrists	and	rubbed	his	raw,	abused palms	against	his	legs.	He	stood,	resisting	the	urge	to	take	a	swing	at	one	of	the soldiers	and	then	walked	to	stand	behind	Baird. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	less	than	five	minutes	he	was	out	of	the	compound	and	riding	in	a	black SUV	with	Baird	towards	Kabul.	They	sat	in	silence	in	the	back	seat,	as	if	Baird was	 waiting	 for	 him	 to	 speak.	 The	 soldiers	 had	 watched	 them	 leave,	 their expressions	 blank.	 Jack	 had	 wanted	 some	 sign	 that	 his	 departure	 meant something	to	them,	but	he	received	none. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	once	they’d	been	driving	for	a	bit,	Baird	spoke.	“Tell	me	where	you want	to	head	from	here,	Jack?	Once	we’re	back	in	Kabul,	I	mean.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 continued	 to	 stare	 out	 of	 the	 window.	 “I	 need	 to	 spend	 some	 time getting	to	the	bottom	of	a	story.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anything	 you	 need.	 You’ll	 have	 a	 room	 at	 the	 Embassy	 for	 a	 few	 days	 to tidy	up	loose	ends	and	then	we’ll	see	you	safety	to	the	airport.”	Baird	patted	him on	 the	 shoulder.	 “I	 hope	 it’s	 a	 good	 story.	 You’ve	 caused	 a	 huge	 stir.	 The Australian	Foreign	Minister	had	to	shout	a	bit	to	get	you	out	of	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 turned	 to	 face	 Baird.	 “It	 concerns	 the	 torture	 and	 abuse	 of	 Afghan prisoners	 by	 United	 States	 Marine	 Corps	 troops.	 It’s	 organized	 and	 I	 have proof.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Baird	 whistled.	 “I	 guess	 I	 better	 get	 ready	 for	 the	 flurry	 of	 diplomatic protests.	But	that’s	no	matter.	If	there’s	a	story	you	need	to	tell	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks.”	Jack	nodded	and	turned	back	to	look	out	of	the	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a><b class="calibre3">3</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	exhaled	deeply	as	he	swung	back	on	the	office	chair	and	stared	up at	 the	 ceiling.	 He	 reached	 up	 and	 rubbed	 his	 eyes,	 wishing	 again	 that the	 Embassy	 had	 some	 real	 coffee.	 He’d	 been	 burning	 the	 candle	 at both	 ends	 to	 get	 to	 the	 bottom	 of	 the	 story	 for	 three	 days	 and	 this, combined	with	the	lack	of	sleep	he’d	had	while	in	prison,	had	him	slow	on	his feet.	He	knew	he	should	stop	and	rest,	but	the	story	was	too	important. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 sighed,	 leaned	 forward,	 and	 resumed	 tapping	 away	 on	 his	 laptop.	 He’d spent	his	time	at	the	Australian	Embassy	in	Kabul	digging	as	deeply	as	he	could into	 Brinson,	 Navitas,	 and	 the	 role	 of	 the	 US	 Marine	 Corps	 in	 torture	 and prisoner	 abuse.	 Though	 Baird	 and	 the	 other	 staff	 had	 stayed	 out	 of	 his	 way,	 he hadn’t	found	much	online	and	the	few	sources	he’d	reached	out	to	hadn’t	been much	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	only	thing	of	use	had	been	some	media	coverage	about	pressure	on	the CIA	 to	 wind-down	 the	 extraordinary	 rendition	 program	 –	 the	 extrajudicial transfer	 of	 prisoners	 to	 other	 countries	 that	 had	 become	 a	 means	 of	 torture	 by proxy	 by	 the	 United	 States.	 It	 seemed	 that	 the	 high	 point	 of	 pressure	 on	 the Agency	 had	 coincided	 with	 the	 opening	 of	 Navitas,	 which	 Jack	 assumed	 had been	torturing	Afghans	from	the	day	it	opened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though	it	could	just	be	a	coincidence,	he	didn’t	feel	like	it	was.	The	attention he’d	received	–	the	detention,	the	beating,	and	the	diplomatic	pressure	that	Baird said	 was	 being	 placed	 on	 Australia	 to	 hand	 him	 over	 –	 all	 spoke	 to	 something</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>important	that	influential	people	felt	it	vital	to	cover	up.	It	was	more	than	some rogue	Marines	kicking	some	Taliban	and	Al	Qaeda	fighters	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	 called	 Josefa	 Takaloka,	 his	 editor	 at	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Standard</i>,	 who’d	 pressured Jack	to	just	write	the	story	as	it	stood.	Jo	had	thought	the	story	good	enough	to run	and	didn’t	want	to	risk	Jack’s	safety	by	digging	deeper.	Jack	had	stalled	and asked	 for	 a	 few	 more	 days	 to	 uncover	 something	 that	 proved	 his	 hunch	 –	 that this	was	a	far	deeper	cancer	than	a	single	camp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	phone	started	to	buzz	on	the	table,	breaking	his	reverie.	He	looked	down and	 was	 surprised	 by	 the	 name	 flashing	 on	 the	 screen.	 He	 answered.	 “Jack Emery.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jack,	 it’s	 Dan	 Ortiz.”	 There	 was	 a	 pause.	 “Where	 are	 you?	 I’ve	 got	 some information	to	share	with	you	but	I	can’t	talk	over	the	phone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m	at	the	Australian	Embassy.	It’s	the	only	place	I’m	safely	able	to	work	at the	moment.”	Jack	hated	saying	it	aloud.	“I’m	sorry,	Dan.	I	can’t	risk	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ortiz	 laughed.	 “And	 what	 do	 you	 think	 I’m	 risking	 even	 by	 calling	 you? </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’re	going	to	want	to	hear	this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	thought	about	it.	While	Ortiz	had	given	Jack	no	reason	to	be	suspicious of	 him,	 he	 did	 work	 for	 the	 same	 branch	 of	 the	 armed	 forces	 that	 Jack	 was investigating.	On	the	other	hand,	he	knew	he	had	barely	any	time	left	to	close	up his	story,	with	the	patience	of	his	editor,	the	Australian	Embassy,	and	the	Afghan Justice	 Minister	 growing	 thin.	 Everyone	 wanted	 him	 out	 of	 the	 country.	 Each extra	day	was	a	risk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides,	 the	 business	 of	 a	 reporter	 was	 out	 in	 the	 field,	 not	 hiding	 inside	 a government	compound.	He	lifted	the	phone	to	his	mouth.	“Okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Great.”	Ortiz	seemed	relieved.	“Where	should	we	meet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	didn’t	hesitate.	“Faisal	Market.	North	entrance.	One	hour.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 terminated	 the	 call	 and	 gathered	 his	 things.	 He	 walked	 out	 of	 the	 small office	 and	 asked	 a	 staffer	 to	 organize	 a	 car,	 ignoring	 the	 protests	 that	 he	 stay inside	the	compound.	The	location	of	the	Embassy	was	classified	and	he	was	a guest,	but	he	was	still	a	free	man.	It	was	made	clear	to	him	as	the	car	pulled	up that	once	he	left	the	building	he	was	on	his	own	until	he	returned.	If	he	returned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fifty	 minutes	 and	 some	 traffic	 later	 he	 was	 at	 Faisal	 Market.	 He	 grabbed	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>kabob	from	a	street	vendor	and	waited	slightly	away	from	where	he’d	told	Ortiz to	 meet	 him.	 He	 wanted	 to	 be	 sure	 what	 he	 was	 getting	 into	 before	 he committed.	As	he	ate,	he	kept	his	eyes	peeled	for	any	sign	of	trouble,	but	as	the minutes	ticked	by	he	felt	more	comfortable.	He	trusted	Ortiz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	 Ortiz	 came	 into	 view.	 He	 was	 disguised	 in	 chinos,	 a	 white	 cotton shirt,	 and	 dark	 sunglasses.	 Importantly,	 from	 what	 Jack	 could	 tell,	 Ortiz	 was alone.	 He	 watched	 as	 Ortiz	 stopped	 in	 place,	 raised	 his	 glasses,	 and	 looked around.	 After	 a	 few	 minutes	 Jack	 threw	 the	 remains	 of	 his	 food	 in	 a	 bin	 and walked	over	to	Ortiz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	walked	up	behind	Ortiz.	“Hi,	Dan.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ortiz	turned	around	and	flashed	a	smile.	“Your	field	craft	is	good,	Jack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	grinned	and	shrugged.	“You	spend	a	few	years	in	the	White	House	Press Corps	and	you	learn	a	thing	or	two	about	stalking	prominent	Americans.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ortiz	 gave	 a	 small	 laugh	 and	 then	 his	 expression	 darkened.	 “I	 need	 your phone,	Jack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	phone.	I	need	it.	I	can’t	talk	to	you	without	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 hesitated,	 then	 reached	 into	 his	 pocket	 and	 handed	 over	 his	 phone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	don’t	break	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ortiz	took	the	phone,	opened	the	back,	and	removed	the	battery	and	the	SIM</p>
<p class="calibre1">card.	He	then	handed	them	back	to	Jack.	“Now	you	can’t	be	listened	to,	but	they still	know	you’re	here.	We	only	have	a	couple	of	minutes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	nodded.	“I’m	in	danger	every	second	I’m	in	this	country,	Dan.	It’s	clear to	 me	 that	 I’ve	 kicked	 over	 an	 ant	 hill,	 but	 I’m	 not	 sure	 how	 deep	 below	 the ground	it	goes.	Or	how	nasty	the	ants	inside	are.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	goes	real	deep	and	they’re	nasty	fuckers,	Jack.”	Ortiz	turned	and	gestured for	Jack	to	follow.	“Walk	with	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 followed.	 They	 walked	 inside	 the	 Faisal	 Market,	 immediately overwhelmed	by	smells	and	hawkers	competing	for	their	attention.	“So?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So.”	 Ortiz	 twisted	 his	 head	 to	 face	 Jack,	 even	 as	 he	 walked.	 “You	 know about	the	CIA	rendition	program?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a><img src="index-32_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 turns	 out	 all	 that	 public	 attention	 on	 the	 Agency	 has	 forced	 them	 to shut	 down	 some	 of	 their	 more	 ambitious	 programs.”	 Ortiz	 paused	 to	 look	 at	 a wallet.	 “It’s	 expanded	 to	 include	 the	 Marine	 Corps,	 among	 other	 agencies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Smaller	scale.	Less	visible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack’s	 eyes	 widened.	 He’d	 thought	 the	 timing	 was	 strange,	 and	 now	 Ortiz was	confirming	it.	“Can	you	substantiate	this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ortiz’s	brow	furrowed	and	he	nodded.	“Sure	can.	I	made	some	inquiries	after our	 run-in	 with	 Brinson.	 A	 friend	 I	 went	 to	 Officer	 Candidate	 School	 with figured	out	what	I	was	looking	into	and	had	a	word	in	my	ear.	He	disagrees	with what’s	going	on	and	can	provide	the	proof,	but	the	kicker	is	that	you	need	to	be out	of	the	country	before	he	releases	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	–	” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ortiz	patted	Jack	on	the	back.	“No	plane,	no	proof.	It’s	that	simple,	Jack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	nodded.	He	could	deal	with	this.	Once	he	was	out	of	the	country	he’d contact	Ortiz	and	get	what	he	needed.	If	it	fell	through	for	whatever	reason,	he had	 enough	 in	 his	 pictures	 and	 the	 testimony	 of	 the	 tortured	 to	 run	 a	 story anyway.	At	worst,	it	was	a	bombshell.	At	best,	it	was	nuclear.	He	had	to	get	back to	the	Embassy	for	long	enough	to	collect	his	things	and	book	a	flight	before	he could	leave	this	desert. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ortiz	reached	into	his	pocket	and	pulled	out	a	pager.	“You’ll	get	a	message on	 this	 when	 I	 know	 you’re	 out	 of	 the	 country	 and	 my	 man	 is	 ready	 with	 the information.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.”	 Jack	 took	 the	 pager	 and	 pocketed	 it,	 struggling	 not	 to	 laugh	 at	 the low-tech	approach.	“I’ll	keep	it	close.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ortiz	 walked	 away	 and	 Jack	 watched	 him	 leave	 as	 the	 bustle	 of	 the	 market continued	 to	 move	 around	 him	 like	 a	 rising	 tide	 against	 a	 small	 island.	 Once Ortiz	 was	 out	 of	 sight,	 he	 took	 one	 final	 look	 around	 and	 exhaled	 deeply.	 He took	 his	 cell	 phone	 out	 of	 his	 pocket,	 reassembled	 it	 and	 started	 to	 dial	 his Embassy	contact.	He	stopped	dead	when	he	felt	something	press	into	his	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello,	Jack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>JACK’S	EYES	were	squeezed	shut	as	he	tried	to	move	his	head	away	from	the	cold steel	barrel	pressed	into	his	temple,	but	Brinson	simply	pushed	the	pistol	against him	harder.	He	was	afraid	of	the	lengths	Brinson	would	go	to	in	order	to	protect his	 secrets,	 even	 as	 his	 mind	 cursed	 his	 stupidity.	 He’d	 walked	 right	 into Brinson’s	grasp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	bundled	into	the	back	of	a	car	with	Brinson	in	the	back	and	two	men in	front.	As	the	black	sedan	roared	forward	and	Jack	was	pushed	back	in	his	seat, his	 eyes	 flicked	 between	 Brinson	 and	 the	 world	 outside.	 They	 were	 leaving Kabul	 and	 the	 relative	 safety	 he’d	 enjoyed.	 US	 and	 Afghani	 authorities	 alike would	do	nothing	to	help	him,	and	he	was	in	the	hands	of	a	man	who	had	every interest	in	silencing	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please,	just	let	me	go.”	Jack’s	voice	wavered	slightly	and	the	barrel	pressed ever	harder.	“I	won’t	report	the	story.	I	won’t	report	 <i class="calibre4">anything</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brinson	 laughed.	 “You	 had	 your	 chance.	 You	 didn’t	 have	 to	 snoop	 around Navitas.	You	could	have	given	up	your	story.	You	could	have	gone	home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	–	” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brinson	pressed	on.	“Instead,	you	kept	digging	and	asking	questions.	I’m	not going	to	hurt	you,	but	you	can’t	be	allowed	to	live.	Goodbye,	Jack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 cowered	 away.	 He	 clenched	 his	 muscles	 and	 gritted	 his	 teeth	 as	 the pistol	clicked	and	gave	a	slight	kick.	A	second	after	Brinson	pulled	the	trigger, however,	 he	 still	 seemed	 to	 be	 alive.	 His	 nostrils	 flared	 and	 he	 inhaled	 deeply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 swung	 his	 hands	 around	 and	 clubbed	 Brinson,	 despite	 the	 handcuffs,	 over and	 over	 again.	 The	 other	 man	 just	 laughed	 as	 he	 weathered	 the	 blows.	 His laughter	only	grew	louder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re	 a	 bastard.”	 Jack	 fumed,	 as	 he	 took	 a	 deep	 breath	 and	 placed	 his hands	 back	 on	 his	 legs.	 It	 wasn’t	 smart	 to	 antagonize	 a	 guy	 with	 a	 gun.	 “A fucking	bastard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brinson	lowered	the	pistol	and	laughed.	“That’s	what	I	like	about	you,	Jack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’ve	 got	 fire.	 I	 wish	 my	 men	 could	 have	 some	 fun	 with	 you.	 Unfortunately, your	fate	is	sealed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brinson	shrugged.	“We	were	just	a	small	outpost	amongst	the	sand	until	you</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>did	your	best	Lois	fucking	Lane	impression	and	stumbled	into	danger.	I’m	not	a bad	 guy.	 We	 tried	 to	 get	 you	 to	 back	 off,	 Jack.	 But	 you	 just	 wouldn’t	 fucking listen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	wife	accuses	me	of	that	all	the	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Brinson	 grunted	 and	 sat	 back	 in	 his	 seat.	 The	 conversation	 had	 clearly finished	for	now.	Jack	had	no	idea	where	they	were	taking	him	but	he	assumed	it was	back	to	Navitas,	where	they’d	kill	him	and	quietly	make	his	body	disappear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	figured	he	had	about	eight	hours	to	live.	What	irked	him	most	was	that	he’d told	nobody	about	the	Dropbox	account.	Josefa	knew	there	was	a	story,	but	not how	to	unlock	any	of	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 closed	 his	 eyes	 and	 settled	 into	 the	 drive,	 racking	 his	 brain	 for	 any possible	way	to	escape.	It	was	useless.	Brinson	had	frisked	him	and	taken	all	of his	gear.	His	hands	were	cuffed	and	he	had	three	marines	sitting	within	six	feet of	 him.	 While	 he	 hoped	 that	 Ortiz	 or	 the	 Embassy	 would	 help,	 Brinson	 was right.	He	was	screwed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	must	have	fallen	asleep,	because	when	he	woke	there	was	no	sign	of	the city,	just	desert	on	either	side	of	the	road.	Jack	looked	to	his	left,	where	Brinson was	 staring	 out	 the	 window	 with	 the	 pistol	 still	 in	 hand.	 Somewhere	 along	 the way	 they’d	 picked	 up	 an	 escort:	 a	 pair	 of	 ANA	 Humvees	 in	 front	 of	 them	 and another	 behind.	 He	 sighed.	 Any	 chance	 of	 escape	 had	 fallen	 from	 minimal	 to zero. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	turned	to	Brinson.	“I	need	to	use	the	bathroom.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Major	Brinson	sighed.	“Really?	You’ll	be	dead	in	two	hours,	Jack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	nodded.	Brinson	sighed	again,	told	his	men	to	pull	over,	and	then	dug around	in	the	bag	at	his	feet	for	some	toilet	paper.	He	tossed	it	to	Jack	as	the	car moved	 onto	 the	 gravel	 shoulder	 of	 the	 road	 and	 ground	 to	 a	 halt.	 The	 Marine riding	 in	 the	 front	 passenger	 seat	 climbed	 out,	 opened	 Jack’s	 door,	 and	 jerked him	roughly	out	of	the	car.	Jack	marched	a	hundred	feet	away	and	squatted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	shat,	Jack	looked	back	to	the	convoy.	Only	the	man	who’d	pulled	him out	of	the	sedan	was	watching	Jack.	The	marine	leaned	against	the	vehicle	with apparent	impatience.	He	had	a	sidearm	with	him,	but	no	rifle.	The	other	marines had	stayed	in	the	vehicle	and	the	ANA	Humvees	showed	no	sign	of	activity	as</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a><img src="index-35_1.jpg" class="calibre2"/></p>
<p class="calibre1">they	idled	with	their	troops	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	exaggerated	the	time	it	was	taking	him	to	finish	as	his	mind	raced.	This was	likely	his	one	chance	to	escape,	even	though	the	possibility	of	any	attempt succeeding	 was	 nearly	 zero.	 There	 were	 a	 dozen	 or	 so	 armed	 men	 less	 than	 a football	 field	 away,	 he	 had	 no	 weapons	 or	 supplies,	 and	 there	 was	 nothing	 but desert	ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	closed	his	eyes	and	breathed	deeply.	He	thought	of	his	wife,	Erin,	waiting back	in	New	York,	oblivious	to	the	danger	he	was	in.	She’d	be	the	most	upset	by his	death	or,	more	likely,	his	unexplained	disappearance.	He	doubted	the	marines would	be	in	a	hurry	to	release	details	about	his	fate.	He’d	be	another	anonymous body	claimed	by	the	sand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	opened	his	eyes	again.	He’d	decided.	This	was	his	only	chance.	He	kept low	as	he	wiped	his	ass	and	pulled	up	his	pants,	keeping	his	eye	on	the	convoy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nobody	was	paying	him	more	than	the	loosest	attention.	As	best	as	he	could	tell, he	 might	 get	 another	 fifty	 yards	 away	 from	 them	 before	 they	 noticed	 what	 he was	doing	and	the	bullets	started	to	fly.	But	he	had	to	try. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stood	at	his	full	height,	turned,	and	sprinted	off	into	the	desert. </p>
<p class="calibre1">JACK	GRUNTED	as	he	hit	the	ground	hard.	His	face	burned	as	it	skidded	across	the gravelly	sand,	as	if	a	hundred	little	needles	full	of	molten	lava	had	been	injected into	his	face	all	at	once.	His	hands	and	feet	flailed	as	he	struggled	to	get	to	his feet	 again.	 His	 mind	 was	 screaming	 at	 him.	 He	 had	 to	 keep	 running.	 Keep moving.	 Keep	 trying	 to	 escape.	 He’d	 gained	 more	 distance	 on	 them	 than	 he’d hoped,	but	they’d	be	closing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 climbed	 onto	 his	 hands	 and	 knees	 and	 shook	 his	 head,	 trying	 to	 clear some	of	the	fog.	He	did	a	quick	stocktake	of	his	limbs	and	everything	appeared intact.	He	struggled	to	his	feet	and	resumed	his	run,	not	knowing	where	he	was going	 but	 needing	 to	 escape.	 He	 focused	 on	 turning	 his	 legs	 over,	 clearing	 his mind,	ignoring	the	pain	and	the	threat	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 made	 it	 another	 hundred	 yards	 and	 then	 he	 turned	 around	 to	 look.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>could	 see	 a	 few	 men	 running	 three	 hundred	 yards	 back.	 One	 of	 the	 ANA Humvees	was	also	pursuing	and	would	be	on	him	in	a	few	moments.	He	turned and	 kept	 running,	 confused	 by	 the	 low	 hum	 he	 could	 hear	 in	 the	 distance.	 The hum	turned	into	a	buzz,	then	into	a	roar.	He	didn’t	dare	look	around.	He	didn’t have	the	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	amount	of	sand	the	pair	of	helicopters	kicked	up	as	they	roared	overhead was	impressive,	and	they	did	little	to	help	Jack’s	attempts	to	remain	upright.	His heart	sank	with	the	knowledge	that	Brinson	must	have	called	in	air	support.	His run	slowed	to	a	jog,	despite	his	pursuers.	With	helicopters	in	the	air	there	was	no point	running. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he	 slowed	 to	 a	 walk	 he	 realized,	 deep	 in	 the	 recesses	 of	 his	 mind,	 that there	 was	 no	 way	 helicopters	 could	 have	 arrived	 in	 the	 short	 time	 he’d	 been running.	 He	 heard	 the	 chattering	 of	 machinegun	 fire.	 He	 turned	 around	 and watched	as	tracer	rounds	spewed	from	the	side	of	one	of	the	helicopters	toward the	convoy.	The	other	helicopter	added	rocket	fire	to	the	carnage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 turned	 around	 and	 ran	 again	 as	 the	 choppers	 rained	 death	 upon	 the convoy.	They	had	US	Marine	Corps	markings,	which	confused	him	further.	He didn’t	know	what	to	think	any	more,	but	he	figured	he	couldn’t	go	wrong	with getting	 away	 from	 all	 of	 it.	 He	 started	 to	 run	 again.	 Ahead	 of	 him,	 another chopper	had	appeared	and	started	to	descend.	In	the	door,	Ortiz	waved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	 didn’t	 know	 if	 anyone	 was	 left	 on	 his	 tail	 as	 the	 choppers	 behind	 him did	their	work,	but	he	didn’t	look	back.	He	just	ran	as	hard	as	he	could	towards the	 door	 and	 hoped	 like	 hell	 that	 he	 didn’t	 take	 one	 in	 the	 back	 before	 he	 got there.	 The	 distance	 closed	 as	 the	 chopper	 touched	 down	 and	 kept	 its	 rotors spinning.	Forty	yards,	then	thirty.	His	lungs	burned	hot	as	he	pushed	himself	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	staggered	forward	another	few	inches.	He	wanted	to	live,	but	he	couldn’t run	anymore.	He	was	spent,	he	could	barely	think	straight,	and	it	was	difficult	to keep	 putting	 one	 foot	 in	 front	 of	 another.	 After	 another	 few	 steps	 toward	 the now-grounded	helicopter,	he	fell	to	his	knees	and	then	onto	his	hands.	He	sucked at	the	hot	desert	air,	struggling	to	breathe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stared	at	the	sand,	his	lungs	heaving	for	air.	He	wanted	to	slump	into	it but	he	wasn’t	sure	how	long	the	rescue	chopper	would	wait.	He	took	one	more</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>deep	breath	and	then	steeled	himself	for	one	more	try.	He	wanted	to	live.	As	he was	about	to	try	to	climb	to	his	feet,	he	felt	a	hand	grip	his	arm.	He	looked	up and	saw	Ortiz	smiling	down	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,	Jack.”	Ortiz	yanked	his	arm	and	helped	Jack	to	his	feet.	“We’ve got	thirty	seconds	before	people	start	to	notice	that	the	birds	have	stopped.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	staggered	to	his	feet	and	let	himself	be	guided	towards	the	open	door	of the	chopper.	Once	he	was	seated	safely	inside,	Ortiz	slid	the	door	shut	and	they were	 airborne	 in	 seconds.	 Jack	 slowly	 caught	 his	 breath	 and	 started	 to	 breathe normally.	Only	then	did	he	start	to	sob.	It	was	uncontrollable.	The	stress	of	the last	few	days	had	finally	overwhelmed	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	shame	in	it,	Jack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	up	at	Ortiz.	“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ortiz	smiled.	“No	shame.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	nodded.	He	wasn’t	sure	if	Ortiz	was	saying	what	he	really	believed	or was	 just	 trying	 to	 make	 him	 feel	 better,	 but	 he	 appreciated	 the	 effort.	 He	 felt	 a bond	 with	 the	 man	 like	 few	 he’d	 had	 in	 his	 life.	 He	 slowly	 calmed	 down	 and settled	back	in	his	seat.	He	watched	as	Ortiz	reached	into	his	combat	vest,	pulled out	a	packet	of	smokes,	and	started	to	hand	them	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Give	 me	 one	 of	 those.”	 Jack	 reached	 out	 and	 plucked	 a	 cigarette	 from	 the packet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Knew	 we’d	 make	 a	 deviant	 out	 of	 you.”	 Ortiz	 grinned	 as	 reached	 out	 to light	Jack’s	cigarette. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	took	a	drag	and	coughed.	“How	did	you	find	me,	Dan?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	pager	had	a	tracker.	Turns	out	some	Corps	brass	weren’t	thrilled	about being	 sucked	 into	 the	 rendition	 program	 and	 we	 thought	 it	 likely	 that	 Brinson would	make	a	move	on	you.	As	far	as	anyone	will	know,	Brinson’s	convoy	was hit	by	Taliban	and	the	helos	were	on	patrol.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack’s	 eyes	 widened.	 He	 had	 no	 idea	 that	 politics	 within	 the	 Marine	 Corps ran	so	deep.	“What	about	my	story?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ortiz	smiled.	“Once	you	get	back	to	the	States	you’ll	have	your	information, Jack.	Unfortunately	Major	Brinson,	the	brainchild	of	the	program,	was	killed	on a	patrol.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>Jack	 nodded.	 He	 understood.	 He	 was	 being	 given	 his	 life	 and	 his	 story	 in return	 for	 keeping	 his	 mouth	 shut	 about	 the	 Marine	 Corps	 cleaning	 up	 their mess.	He	didn’t	know	what	politics	were	playing	out	between	the	Marine	Corps and	the	CIA,	or	even	what	else	would	occur	in	future,	but	all	he	knew	was	that he	wanted	out	of	Afghanistan.	He’d	had	enough	of	the	country’s	hospitality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack	closed	his	eyes.	The	sound	of	the	helicopter’s	rotors	slicing	through	the air	 was	 rhythmic,	 and	 no	 further	 words	 were	 needed	 between	 the	 two	 of	 them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 took	 another	 deep	 drag	 of	 the	 cigarette,	 exhaled,	 and	 coughed	 only	 lightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’d	 never	 smoked	 before	 and	 had	 no	 intention	 of	 starting,	 but	 it	 seemed	 a fitting	way	to	end	the	week	from	hell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 soon	 as	 he	 was	 home	 he	 was	 going	 to	 have	 a	 whisky,	 sleep	 next	 to	 his wife,	and	wake	up	only	for	bacon.	The	story	could	wait	a	day	or	two. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a><b class="calibre3">SAMPLE	OF	THE	FOUNDATION	(JACK	EMERY	1)</b></p>
<p class="calibre1">Chen	Shubian	cursed	under	his	breath	at	the	old	Hewlett	Packard	as	it whirred	to	life.	He	was	seated	at	the	rear	of	a	little	internet	café	on	the outskirts	 of	 Taipei,	 watching	 the	 light	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 case occasionally	 flash	 with	 activity.	 He	 was	 losing	 patience	 and	 about	 to	 force	 a restart	when	the	Microsoft	logo	appeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chen	shook	his	head.	“Vista.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	dug	a	small	envelope	from	his	pocket	and	tore	it	open.	Inside	was	a	piece of	paper	with	an	alphanumeric	code,	meaningless	to	most	people.	It	was	Chen’s key	 to	 the	 private	 server	 set	 up	 by	 his	 employers.	 They’d	 found	 him	 on	 the Darknet,	 a	 refugee	 searching	 for	 his	 vengeance,	 and	 brought	 him	 to	 their community.	 Now,	 the	 private	 server	 allowed	 them	 to	 conduct	 business	 outside the	view	of	the	authorities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 code	 wasn’t	 all	 that	 was	 required	 to	 access	 the	 server.	 He	 plugged	 his Hello	Kitty	USB	into	the	front	slot	of	the	computer	and	tapped	his	fingers	on	the desk	 as	 the	 ancient	 machine	 whirred	 some	 more.	 He	 typed	 the	 code	 into	 the black	command	box	that	appeared	on	the	screen	and	hit	enter.	The	black	box	was replaced	by	an	ordinary-looking	web	browser. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chen	 clicked	 the	 only	 bookmark	 on	 the	 browser,	 which	 took	 him	 to	 a message	board	where	likeminded	people	connected	to	chat	about	politics,	sport and	 blowing	 up	 international	 infrastructure.	 A	 message	 at	 the	 top	 of	 the	 screen reminded	 users	 to	 ensure	 the	 security	 of	 the	 network,	 lest	 they	 end	 up	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a>residence	at	Guantanamo	Bay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chen	 searched	 his	 pockets	 again	 and	 found	 a	 small	 photo.	 He	 put	 it	 below the	 computer	 screen	 and	 stared	 at	 it	 for	 a	 few	 moments.	 His	 mother	 and	 father stared	back	at	him,	standing	on	either	side	of	a	slender	fifteen-year-old	boy	with straight,	shiny,	black	hair.	The	photo	had	been	taken	the	last	time	Chen	and	his parents	were	all	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chen’s	 life	 had	 changed	 forever	 when	 his	 father—an	 employee	 of	 a	 large American	 investment	 bank—had	 been	 arrested	 on	 a	 routine	 business	 trip	 from Taiwan	to	China.	He	had	been	charged	with	espionage	and	executed	after	a	show trial.	In	grief,	Chen’s	mother	had	taken	her	own	life	soon	after	the	death	of	her husband. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chen	blamed	China,	but	he	also	blamed	the	American	bank	that	had	left	his father	to	rot.	They’d	obviously	determined	that	their	business	interests	in	China were	 more	 important	 and	 had	 done	 nothing	 to	 help	 his	 father.	 The	 thirst	 for vengeance	 against	 China	 had	 guided	 Chen’s	 life	 ever	 since:	 from	 school,	 to university,	to	the	Taiwanese	Army	and	then	its	Special	Operations	Command.	It had	honed	his	anger	and	his	skills. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though	the	attack	he	planned	would	rock	China,	his	employers	assured	him that	 the	 act	 would	 also	 cause	 great	 heartache	 for	 the	 United	 States.	 It	 was	 a happy	coincidence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 smiled	 with	 pride	 as	 he	 browsed	 the	 thread,	 which	 connected	 him	 with others	slighted	by	China	and	united	them	all	under	one	cause.	He	left	a	message for	those	who	would	help	him	undertake	the	attack,	confirming	the	final	details. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	typed	another	to	his	employers	in	the	endeavor,	noting	that	their	funding	had been	received	and	confirming	the	details	of	their	meeting	in	a	few	days’	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 he	 was	 finished,	 he	 ejected	 the	 USB	 and	 all	 signs	 of	 the	 message board	 vanished	 from	 the	 screen.	 Chen	 left	 the	 internet	 café	 as	 anonymously	 as he’d	 entered,	 satisfied	 that	 everything	 was	 in	 place	 for	 the	 attack.	 He	 had	 no expectation	 that	 he’d	 bring	 down	 the	 Chinese	 Government,	 though	 he	 did believe	that	a	heavy	enough	blow	could	cause	a	fracture	in	the	monolith.	He	felt a	small	degree	of	guilt	for	the	innocents	who’d	die,	but	their	lives	were	the	price of	vengeance. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>Men	 of	 decisive	 action	 changed	 the	 world,	 and	 if	 it	 had	 been	 good	 enough for	Mao,	who’d	driven	Chen’s	ancestors	from	mainland	China	to	Taiwan,	then	it was	certainly	good	enough	for	him. </p>
