<p class="calibre3">“Why?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Because it pleases me.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You are fond of hogs, then, Pencroff?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I am very fond of them,” replied the sailor, “especially of their feet, and if any had eight instead of four I would like them twice as much.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">These animals were peccaries, belonging to one of the four genera, which make up that family. This particular species were the “tajassans,” known by there dark color and the absence of those long fangs which belong to the others of their race. Peccaries generally live in herds, and it was likely that these animals abounded in the woody parts of the island. At all events they were edible from head to foot, and Pencroff asked nothing more.</p>
<p class="calibre3">About the 15th of August the weather moderated suddenly by a change of wind to the northwest. The temperature rose several degrees higher, and the vapors accumulated in the air were soon resolved into snow. The whole island was covered with a white mantle, and presented a new aspect to its inhabitants. It snowed hard for several days and the ground was covered two feet deep. The wind soon rose with great violence and from the top of Granite House they could hear the sea roaring against the reefs.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At certain angles the wind made eddies in the air, and the snow, forming itself into high whirling columns, looked like those twisting waterspouts which vessels attack with cannon. The hurricane, coming steadily from the northwest, spent its force on the other side of the island, and the eastern lookout of Granite House preserved it from a direct attack.</p>
<p class="calibre3">During this snow-storm, as terrible as those of the polar regions, neither Smith nor his companions could venture outside. They were completely housed for five days, from the 20th to the 25th of August. They heard the tempest roar though Jacamar Woods, which must have suffered sadly. Doubtless numbers of trees were uprooted, but Pencroff comforted himself with the reflection that there would be fewer to cut down.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The wind will be wood-cutter; let it alone,” said he.</p>
<p class="calibre3">How fervently now the inhabitants of Granite House must have thanked Heaven for having given to them this solid and impenetrable shelter! Smith had his share of their gratitude, but after all, it was nature which had hollowed out this enormous cave, and he had only discovered it. Here all were in safety, the violence of the tempest could not reach them. If they had built a house of brick and wood on Prospect Plateau, it could not have resisted the fury of this hurricane. As for the Chimneys, they heard the billows strike them with such violence that they knew they must be uninhabitable, for the sea, having entirely covered their islet, beat upon them with all its force.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But here at Granite House, between these solid walls which neither wind nor water could effect, they had nothing to fear. During this confinement the colonists were not idle. There was plenty of wood in the storehouse cut into planks, and little by little they completed their stock of furniture. As far as tables and chairs went they were certainly solid enough, for the material was not spared. This furniture was a little too heavy to fulfil its essential purpose of being easily moved, but it was the pride of Neb and Pencroff, who would not have exchanged it for the handsomest Buhl.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then the carpenters turned basket-makers, and succeeded remarkably well at this new occupation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They had discovered at the northern part of the lake a thick growth of purple osiers. Before the rainy season, Pencroff and Herbert had gathered a good many of these useful shrubs; and their branches, being now well seasoned, could be used to advantage. Their first specimens were rough; but, thanks to the skill and intelligence of the workmen consulting together, recalling the models they had seen, and rivalling each other in their efforts, hampers and baskets of different sizes here soon added to the stock of the colony. The storehouse was filled with them, and Neb set away in special baskets his stock of pistachio nuts and roots of the dragon tree.</p>
<p class="calibre3">During the last week in August the weather changed again, the temperature fell a little, and the storm was over. The colonists at once started out. There must have been at least two feet of snow on the shore, but it was frozen over the top, which made it easy to walk over. Smith and his companions climbed up Prospect Plateau. What a change they beheld! The woods which they had left in bloom, especially the part nearest to them where the conifers were plenty, were now one uniform color.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Everything was white, from the top of Mount Franklin to the coast—forests, prairie, lake, river, beach. The waters of the Mercy ran under a vault of ice, which cracked and broke with a loud noise at every change of tide. Thousands of birds—ducks and wood-peckers—flew over the surface of the lake. The rocks between which the cascade plunged to the borders of the Plateau were blocked up with ice. One would have said that the water leaped out of a huge gargoyle, cut by some fantastic artist of the Renaissance. To calculate the damage done to the forest by this hurricane would be impossible until the snow had entirely disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Spilett, Pencroff, and Herbert took this opportunity to look after their traps and had hard work finding them under their bed of snow. There was danger of their falling in themselves; a humiliating thing to be caught in one’s own trap! They were spared this annoyance, however, and found the traps had been untouched; not an animal had been caught, although there were a great many footprints in the neighborhood, among others, very clearly impressed marks of claws.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Herbert at once classified these carnivora among the cat tribe, a circumstance which justified the engineer’s belief in the existence of dangerous beasts on Lincoln Island. Doubtless these beasts dwelt in the dense forests of the Far West; but driven by hunger, they had ventured as far as Prospect Plateau. Perhaps they scented the inhabitants of Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What, exactly, are these carnivora?” asked Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“They are tigers,” replied Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I thought those animals were only found in warm countries.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“In the New World,” replied the lad, “they are to be found from Mexico to the pampas of Buenos Ayres. Now, as Lincoln Island is in almost the same latitude as La Plata, it is not surprising that tigers are found here.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“All right, we will be on our guard,” replied Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the meantime, the temperature rising, the snow began to melt, it came on to rain, and gradually the white mantle disappeared. Notwithstanding the bad weather the colonists renewed their stock of provisions, both animal and vegetable.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This necessitated excursions into the forest, and thus they discovered how many trees had been beaten down by the hurricane. The sailor and Neb pushed forward with their wagon as far as the coal deposit in order to carry back some fuel. They saw on their way that the chimney of the pottery oven had been much damaged by the storm; at least six feet had been blown down.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They also renewed their stock of wood as well as that of coal, and the Mercy having become free once more, they employed the current to draw several loads to Granite House. It might be that the cold season was not yet over.</p>
<p class="calibre3">A visit had been made to the Chimneys also, and the colonists could not be sufficiently grateful that this had not been their home during the tempest. The sea had left undoubted signs of its ravages. Lashed by the fury of the wind from the offing, and rushing over Safety Island, it spent its full force upon these passages, leaving them half full of sand and the rocks thickly covered with seaweed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">While Neb, Herbert, and Pencroff spent their time in hunting and renewing their supply of fuel, Smith andSpilett set to work to clear out the Chimneys. They found the forge and furnaces almost unhurt, so carefully protected had they been by the banks of sand which the colonists had built around them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was a fortunate thing that they laid in a fresh supply of fuel, for the colonists had not yet seen the end of the intense cold. It is well known that in the Northern Hemisphere, the month of February is noted for its low temperature. The same rule held good in the Southern Hemisphere, and the end of August, which is the February of North America, did not escape from this climatic law.</p>
<p class="calibre3">About the 25th, after another snow and rain storm, the wind veered to the southeast, and suddenly the cold became intense. In the engineer’s opinion, a Fahrenheit thermometer would have indicated about eight degrees below zero, and the cold was rendered more severe by a cutting wind which lasted for several days.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists were completely housed again, and as they were obliged to block up all their windows, only leaving one narrow opening for ventilation, the consumption of candles was considerable. In order to economize them, the colonists often contented themselves with only the light from the fire; for fuel was plenty.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Once or twice some of them ventured to the beach, among the blocks of ice which were heaped up there by every fresh tide. But they soon climbed up to Granite House again. This ascent was very painful, as their hands were frostbitten by holding on to the frozen sides of the ladder.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There were still many leisure hours to be filled up during this long confinement, so Smith undertook another indoor occupation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The only sugar which they had had up to this time was a liquid substance which they had procured by making deep cuts in the bark of the maple tree. They collected this liquid in jars and used it in this condition for cooking purposes. It improved with age, becoming whiter and more like a syrup in consistency. But they could do better than this, and one day Cyrus Smith announced to his companions that he was going to turn them into refiners.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Refiners! I believe that’s a warm trade?” said Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Very warm!” replied the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then it will suit this season!” answered the sailor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Refining did not necessitate a stock of complicated tools or skilled workmen; it was a very simple operation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To crystallize this liquid they first clarified it, by putting it on the fire in earthenware jars, and submitting it to evaporation. Soon a scum rose to the surface, which, when it began to thicken, Neb removed carefully with a wooden ladle. This hastened the evaporation, and at the same time prevented it from scorching.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After several hours boiling over a good fire, which did as much good to the cooks as it did to the boiling liquid, it turned into a thick syrup. This syrup was poured into clay moulds which they had made beforehand, in various shapes in the same kitchen furnace.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The next day the syrup hardened, forming cakes and loaves. It was sugar of a reddish color, but almost transparent, and of a delicious taste.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The cold continued until the middle of September, and the inmates of Granite House began to find their captivity rather tedious. Almost every day they took a run out-doors, but they always soon returned. They were constantly at work over their household duties, and talked while they worked.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith instructed his companions in everything, and especially explained to them the practical applications of science.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists had no library at their disposal, but the engineer was a book, always ready, always open at the wished-for page. A book which answered their every question, and one which they often read. Thus the time passed, and these brave man had no fear for the future.</p>
<p class="calibre3">However, they were all anxious for the end of their captivity, and longed to see, if not fine weather, at least a cessation of the intense cold. If they had only had warmer clothing, they would have attempted excursions to the downs and to Tadorns’ Fens, for game would have been easy to approach, and the hunt would assuredly have been fruitful. But Smith insisted that no one should compromise his health, as he had need of every hand; and his advice was taken.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The most impatient of the prisoners, after Pencroff, was Top. The poor dog found himself in close quarters in Granite House, and ran from room to room, showing plainly the uneasiness he felt at this confinement.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith often noticed that whenever he approached the dark well communicating with the sea, which had its opening in the rear of the storehouse, Top whined in a most curious manner, and ran around and around the opening, which had been covered over with planks of wood. Sometimes he even tried to slip his paws under the planks, as if trying to raise them up, and yelped in a way which indicated at the same time anger and uneasiness.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The engineer several times noticed this strange behavior, and wondered what there could be in the abyss to have such a peculiar effect upon this intelligent dog.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This well, of course, communicated with the sea. Did it then branch off into narrow passages through the rock-work of the island? Was it in communication with other caves? Did any sea-monsters come into it from time to time from the bottom of these pits?</p>
<p class="calibre3">The engineer did not know what to think, and strange thoughts passed through his mind. Accustomed to investigate scientific truths, he could not pardon himself for being drawn into the region of the mysterious and supernatural; but how explain why Top, the most sensible of dogs, who never lost his time in barking at the moon, should insist upon exploring this abyss with nose and ear, if there was nothing there to arouse his suspicions?</p>
<p class="calibre3">Top’s conduct perplexed Smith more than he cared to own to himself. However, the engineer did not mention this to any one but Spilett, thinking it useless to worry his companions with what might be, after all, only a freak of the dog.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At last the cold spell was over. They had rain, snow-squalls, hail-storms, and gales of wind, but none of these lasted long. The ice thawed and the snow melted; the beach, plateau, banks of the Mercy, and the forest were again accessible. The return of spring rejoiced the inmates of Granite House, and they soon passed all their time in the open air, only returning to eat and sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They hunted a good deal during the latter part of September, which led Pencroff to make fresh demands for those fire-arms which he declared Smith had promised him. Smith always put him off, knowing that without a special stock of tools it would be almost impossible to make a gun which would be of any use to them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Besides, he noticed that Herbert and Spilett had become very clever archers, that all sorts of excellent game, both feathered and furred—agoutis, kangaroos, cabiais, pigeons, bustards, wild ducks, and snipe—fell under their arrows; consequently the firearms could wait. But the stubborn sailor did not see it in this light, and constantly reminded the engineer that he had not provided them with guns; and Gideon Spilett supported Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“If,” said he, “the island contains, as we suppose, wild beasts, we must consider how to encounter and exterminate them. The time may come when this will be our first duty.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">But just now it was not the question of firearms which occupied Smith’s mind, but that of clothes. Those which the colonists were wearing had lasted through the winter, but could not hold out till another. What they must have at any price was skins of the carnivora, or wool of the ruminants; and as moufflons (mountain goats), were plenty, they must consider how to collect a flock of them which they could keep for the benefit of the colony. They would also lay out a farm yard in a favorable part of the island, where they could have an enclosure for domestic animals and a poultry yard.</p>
<p class="calibre3">These important projects must be carried out during the good weather. Consequently, in view of these future arrangements, it was important to undertake a reconnoissance into the unexplored part of Lincoln Island, to wit:—the high forests which extended along the right bank of the Mercy, from its mouth to the end of Serpentine Peninsula. But they must be sure of their weather, and a month must yet elapse before it would be worth while to undertake this exploration. While they were waiting impatiently, an incident occurred which redoubled their anxiety to examine the whole island.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was now the 24th of October. On this day Pencroff went to look after his traps which he always kept duly baited. In one of them, he found three animals, of a sort welcome to the kitchen. It was a female peccary with her two little ones. Pencroff returned to Granite House, delighted with his prize, and, as usual, made a great talk about it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Now, we’ll have a good meal, Mr Smith,” cried he, “and you too, Mr. Spilett, must have some.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I shall be delighted,” said the reporter, “but what is it you want me to eat?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Sucking pig,” said Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Oh, a suckling-pig! To hear you talk one would think you had brought back a stuffed partridge!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Umph,” said Pencroff, “so you turn up your nose at my suckling pig?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No,” answered Spilett coolly, “provided one does not get too much of them—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Very well, Mr. Reporter!” returned the sailor, who did not like to hear his game disparaged. “You are getting fastidious! Seven months ago, when we were cast upon this island, you would have been only too glad to have come across such game.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, well,” said the reporter, “men are never satisfied.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And now,” continued Pencroff, “I hope Neb will distinguish himself. Let us see; these little peccaries are only three months old, they will be as tender as quail. Come, Neb, I will superintend the cooking of them myself.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The sailor, followed by Neb, hastened to the kitchen, and was soon absorbed over the oven. The two prepared a magnificent repast; the two little peccaries, kangaroo soup, smoked ham, pistachio nuts, dragon-tree wine, Oswego tea; in a word, everything of the best. But the favorite dish of all was the savory peccaries made into a stew. At 5 o’clock, dinner was served in the dining-room of Granite House. The kangaroo soup smoked upon the table. It was pronounced excellent.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After the soup came the peccaries, which Pencroff begged to be allowed to carve, and of which he gave huge pieces to every one. These suckling pigs were indeed delicious, and Pencroff plied his knife and fork with intense earnestness, when suddenly a cry and an oath escaped him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What’s the matter?” said Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The matter is that I have just lost a tooth!” replied the sailor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Are there pebbles in your peccaries, then?” said Spilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It seems so,” said the sailor, taking out of his mouth the object which had cost him a grinder.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was not a pebble, it was a leaden pellet.</p>

<p class="calibre3">CONCERNING THE LEADEN PELLET—MAKING A CANOE—HUNTING—IN THE TOP OF A KAURI—NOTHING TO INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF MAN—THE TURTLE ON ITS BACK—THE TURTLE DISAPPEARS—SMITH’S EXPLANATION.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was exactly seven months since the passengers in the balloon had been thrown upon Lincoln Island. In all this time no human being had been seen. No smoke had betrayed the presence of man upon he island. No work of man’s hands, either ancient or modern, had attested his passage. Not only did it seem uninhabited at present, but it appeared to have been so always. And now all the framework of deductions fell before a little bit of metal found in the body of a pig.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was certainly a bullet from a gun, and what but a human being would be so provided?</p>
<p class="calibre3">When Pencroff had placed it upon the table, his companions looked at it with profound astonishment. The possibilities suggested by this seemingly trivial incident flashed before them. The sudden appearance of a supernatural being could not have impressed them more.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith instantly began to reason upon the theories which this incident, as surprising as it was unexpected, suggested. Taking the bit of lead between his fingers he turned it round and about for some time before he spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You are sure, Pencroff,” he asked, at length, “that the peccary was hardly three months old?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m sure, sir,” answered the sailor. “It was sucking its mother when I found it in the ditch.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, then, that proves that within three months a gun has been fired upon Lincoln Island.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And that the bullet has wounded, though not mortally, this little animal,” added Spilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Undoubtedly,” replied Smith; “and now let us see what conclusions are to be drawn from this incident. Either the island was inhabited before our arrival, or men have landed here within three months. How these men arrived, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, whether by landing or by shipwreck, cannot be settled at present. Neither have we any means of determining whether they are Europeans or Malays, friends or enemies; nor do we know whether they are living here at present or whether they have gone. But these questions are too important to be allowed to remain undecided.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No!” cried the sailor springing from the table. “There can be no men besides ourselves on Lincoln Island. Why, the island is not large: and if it had been inhabited, we must have met some one of its people before this.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It would, indeed, be astonishing if we had not,” said Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But it would be much more astonishing, I think,” remarked the reporter, “if this little beast had been born with a bullet in his body!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Unless,” suggested Neb, seriously, “Pencroff had had it—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“How’s that, Neb?” interrupted the sailor, “I, to have had a bullet in my jaw for five or six months, without knowing it? Where would it have been?” he added, opening his mouth and displaying the thirty-two splendid teeth that ornamented it. “Look, Neb, and if you can find one broken one in the whole set you may pull out half-a-dozen!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Neb’s theory is inadmissible,” said Smith, who, in spite of the gravity of his thoughts, could not restrain a smile. “It is certain that a gun has been discharged on the island within three months. But I am bound to believe that the persons on this island have been here but a short time, or else simply landed in passing; as, had the island had inhabitants when we made the ascent of Mount Franklin, we must have seen them or been seen. It is more probable, that within the past few weeks some people have been shipwrecked somewhere upon the coast; the thing, therefore, to do is to discover this point.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I think we should act cautiously,” said the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I think so, too,” replied Smith, “as I fear that they must be Malay pirates;”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“How would it do, Mr. Smith,” said the sailor, “to build A canoe so that we could go up this river, or, if need be, round the coast? It won’t do to be taken unawares.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It’s a good idea,” answered the engineer; “but we have not the time now. It would take at least a month to build a canoe—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“A regular one, yes,” rejoined the sailor; “but we don’t want it to stand the sea. I will guarantee to make one in less than five days that will do to use on the Mercy.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Build a boat in five days,” cried Neb.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, Neb, one of Indian fashion.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Of wood?” demanded the negro, still incredulous.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Of wood, or what is better, of bark,” answered Pencroff. “Indeed, Mr. Smith, it could be done in five days!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Be it so, then,” answered the engineer. “In five days.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But we must look out for ourselves in the meantime!” said Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“With the utmost caution, my friends,” answered Smith. “And be very careful to confine your hunting expeditions to the neighborhood of Granite House.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The dinner was finished in lower spirits than Pencroff had expected. The incident of the bullet proved beyond doubt that the island had been, or was now, inhabited by others, and such a discovery awakened the liveliest anxiety in the breasts of the colonists.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith and Spilett, before retiring, had a long talk about these things. They questioned, if by chance this incident had an connection with the unexplained rescue of the engineer, and other strange events which they had encountered in so many ways. Smith, after having discussed the pros and cons of the question, ended by saying:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“In short, Spilett, do you want to know my opinion?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, Cyrus.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, this is it. No matter how minutely we examine the island, we will find nothing!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff began his work the next day. He did not mean to build a boat with ribs and planks, but simply a flat bottomed float, which would do admirably in the Mercy, especially in the shallow water and its sources. Strips of bark fastened together would be sufficient for their purpose, and in places where a portage would be necessary the affair would be neither heavy nor cumbersome. The sailor’s idea was to fasten the strips of bark together with clinched nails, and thus to make the craft staunch.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The first thing was to select trees furnishing a supple and tough bark. Now, it had happened that the last storm had blown down a number of Douglass pines, which were perfectly adapted to this purpose. Some of these lay prone upon the earth, and all the colonists had to do was to strip them of their bark, though this indeed was somewhat difficult, on account of the awkwardness of their tools.</p>
<p class="calibre3">While the sailor, assisted by the engineer was thus occupied, Herbert and Spilett, who had been made purveyors to the colony, were not idle. The reporter could not help admiring the young lad, who had acquired a remarkable proficiency in the use of the bow and arrows, and who exhibited, withal, considerable hardiness and coolness. The two hunters, remembering the caution of the engineer, never ventured more than two miles from Granite House, but the outskirts of the forest furnished a sufficient supply of agoutis, cabiais, kangaroos, peccaries, etc., and although the traps had not done so well since the cold had abated, the warren furnished a supply sufficient for the wants of the colonists.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Often, while on these excursions, Herbert conversed with Spilett about the incident of the bullet and of the engineer’s conclusions, and one day—the 26th of October—he said:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Don’t you think it strange, Mr. Spilett, that any people should have been wrecked on this island, and never have followed up the coast to Granite House?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Very strange if they are still here,” answered the reporter, “but not at all astonishing if they are not.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then you think they have gone again?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is likely, my boy, that, if they had staid any time, or were still here, something would have discovered their presence.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But if they had been able to get off again they were not really shipwrecked.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, Herbert, they were what I should call shipwrecked temporarily. That is, it is possible that they were driven by stress of weather upon the island, without having to abandon their vessel, and when the wind moderated they set out again.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“One thing is certain,” said Herbert, “and that is, that Mr. Smith has always seemed to dread, rather than to desire, the presence of human beings on our island.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The reason is, that he knows that only Malays frequent these seas, and these gentlemen are a kind of rascals that had better be avoided.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Is it not possible, sir, that some time we will discover traces of their landing and, perhaps, be able to settle this point?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is not unlikely, my boy. An abandoned camp or the remains of a fire, we would certainly notice, and these are what we will look for on our exploration.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The hunters, talking in this way, found themselves in a portion of the forest near the Mercy, remarkable for its splendid trees. Among others, were those magnificent conifera, called by the New Zealanders “kauris,” rising mere than 200 feet in height.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I have an idea, Mr. Spilett,” said Herbert, “supposing I climb to the top of one of these kauris, I could see, perhaps, for a good ways.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It’s a good idea,” answered the other, “but can you climb one of these giants?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I am going to try, anyhow,” exclaimed the boy, springing upon the lower branches of one, which grew in such a manner as to make the tree easy to mount. In a few minutes he was in its top, high above all the surrounding leafage of the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre3">From this height, the eye could take in all the southern portion of the island between Claw Cape on the southeast and Reptile Promontory on the southwest. To the northwest rose Mount Franklin, shutting out more than one-fourth of the horizon.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But Herbert, from his perch, could overlook the very portion of the island which was giving, or had given, refuge to the strangers whose presence they suspected. The lad looked about him with great attention, first towards the sea, where not a sail was visible, although it was possible that a ship, and especially one dismasted, lying close in to shore, would be concealed from view by the trees which hid the coast. In the woods of the Far West nothing could be seen. The forest formed a vast impenetrable dome many miles in extent, without an opening or glade. Even the course of the Mercy could not be seen, and it might be that there were other streams flowing westward, which were equally invisible.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But, other signs failing, could not the lad catch in the air some smoke that would indicate the presence of man? The atmosphere was pure, and the slightest vapor was sharply outlined against the sky. For an instant Herbert thought he saw a thin film rising in the west, but a more careful observation convinced him that he was mistaken. He looked again, however, with all care, and his sight was excellent. No, certainly, it was nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Herbert climbed down the tree, and he and the reporter returned to Granite House. There Smith listened to the lad’s report without comment. It was plain he would not commit himself until after the island had been explored.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Two days later—the 28th of October—another unaccountable incident happened.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In strolling along the beach, two miles from Granite House, Herbert and Neb had been lucky enough to capture a splendid specimen of the chelonia mydas (green turtle), whose carapace shone with emerald reflections. Herbert had caught sight of it moving among the rocks towards the sea.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Stop him, Neb, stop him!” he cried.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Neb ran to it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It’s a fine animal,” said Neb, “but how are we going to keep it?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s easy enough, Neb. All we have to do is to turn it on its back, and then it cannot get away. Take your spear and do as I do.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The reptile had shut itself in its shell, so that neither its head nor eyes were visible, and remained motionless as a rock. The lad and the negro placed their spears underneath it, and, after some difficulty, succeeded in turning it over. It measured three feet in length, and must have weighed at least 400 pounds.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“There, that will please Pencroff,” cried Neb.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Indeed, the sailor could not fail to be pleased, as the flesh of these turtles, which feed upon eel-grass, is very savory.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And now what can we do with our game?” asked Neb; “we can’t carry it to Granite House.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Leave it here, since it cannot turn back again,” answered Herbert, “and we will come for it with the cart.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Neb agreed, and Herbert, as an extra precaution, which the negro thought useless, propped up the reptile with large stones. Then the two returned to Granite House, following the beach, on which the tide was down. Herbert, wishing to surprise Pencroff, did not tell him of the prize which was lying on its back upon the sand; but two hours later Neb and he returned with the cart to where they had left it, and—the “splendid specimen of chelonia mydas” was not there!</p>
<p class="calibre3">The two looked about them. Certainly, this was where they had left it. Here were the stones he had used, and, therefore, the lad could not be mistaken.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Did the beast turn over, after all?” asked Neb.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It seems so,” replied Herbert, puzzled, and examining the stones scattered over the sand.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Pencroff will be disappointed.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And Mr. Smith will be troubled to explain this!” thought Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well,” said Neb, who wished to conceal their misadventure, “we won’t say anything about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Indeed, we will tell the whole story,” answered Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And taking with them the useless cart, they returned to Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At the shipyard they found the engineer and the sailor working together. Herbert related all that happened.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You foolish fellows,” cried the sailor, “to let at least fifty pounds of soup, escape!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But, Pencroff,” exclaimed Neb, “it was not our fault that the reptile got away; haven’t I told you we turned it on its back?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then you didn’t turn it enough!” calmly asserted the stubborn sailor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Not enough!” cried Herbert; and he told how he had taken care to prop the turtle up with stones.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then it was a miracle!” exclaimed Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Mr. Smith,” asked Herbert, “I thought that turtles once placed on their backs could not get over again, especially the very large ones?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That is the fact,” answered Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then how did it—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“How far off from the sea did you leave this turtle,” asked the engineer, who had stopped working and was turning this incident over in his mind.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“About fifteen feet,” answered Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And it was low water?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well,” responded the engineer, “what the turtle could not do on land, he could do in water. When the tide rose over him he turned over, and—tranquilly paddled off.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“How foolish we are,” cried Neb.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That is just what I said you were,” answered Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith had given this explanation, which was doubtless admissible; but was he himself satisfied with it? He did not venture to say that.</p>
<p class="calibre3"><a id="XXIV"></a></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00038" class="calibre2">CHAPTER XXIV.</h4>
<p class="calibre3">TRIAL OF THE CANOE—A WRECK ON THE SHORE—THE TOW—JETSAM POINT—INVENTORY OF THE BOX—WHAT PENCROFF WANTED—A BIBLE—A VERSE FROM THE BIBLE.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the 29th of October the canoe was finished. Pencroff had kept his word, and had built, in five days, a sort of bark shell, stiffened with flexible crejimba rods. A seat at either end, another midway to keep it open, a gunwale for the thole-pins of a pair of oars, and a paddle to steer with, completed this canoe, which was twelve feet in length, and did not weigh 200 pounds.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hurrah!” cried the sailor, quite ready to applaud his own success. “With this we can make the tour of—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Of the world?” suggested Spilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, but of the island. Some stones for ballast, a mast in the bow, with a sail which Mr. Smith will make some day, and away we’ll go! But now let us try our new ship, for we must see if it will carry all of us.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The experiment was made. Pencroff, by a stroke of the paddle, brought the canoe close to the shore by a narrow passage between the rocks, and he was confident that they could at once make a trial trip of the craft by following the bank as far as the lower point where the rocks ended.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As they were stepping in, Neb cried:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But your boat leaks, Pencroff.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Oh, that’s nothing, Neb,” answered the sailor. “The wood has to drink! But in two days it will not show, and there will be as little water in our canoe as in the stomach of a drunkard! Come, get in!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">They all embarked, and Pencroff pushed off. The weather was splendid, the sea was as calm as a lake, and the canoe could venture upon it with as much security as upon the tranquil current of the Mercy.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Neb and Herbert took the oars, and Pencroff sat in the stern with the paddle as steersman.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The sailor crossed the channel, and rounded the southern point of the islet. A gentle breeze was wafted from the south. There were no billows, but the canoe rose and fell with the long undulations of the sea, and they rowed out half a mile from the coast so as to get a view of the outline of Mount Franklin. Then, putting about, Pencroff returned towards the mouth of the river, and followed along the rounded shore which hid the low marshy ground of Tadorn’s Fen. The point, made longer by the bend of the coast, was three miles from the Mercy, and the colonists resolved to go past it far enough to obtain a hasty glance at the coast as far as Claw Cape.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The canoe followed along the shore, keeping off some two cables length so as to avoid the line of rocks beginning to be covered by the tide. The cliff, beginning at the mouth of the river, lowered as it approached the promontory. It was a savage-looking, unevenly-arranged heap of granite blocks, very different from the curtain of Prospect Plateau. There was not a trace of vegetation on this sharp point, which projected two miles beyond the forest, like a giant’s arm, thrust out from a green sleeve.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The canoe sped easily along. Spilett sketched the outline of the coast in his note-book, and Neb, Pencroff, and Herbert discussed the features of their new domain; and as they moved southward the two Mandible Capes seemed to shut together and enclose Union Bay. As to Smith, he regarded everything in silence, and from his distrustful expression it seemed as if he was observing some suspicious land.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The canoe had reached the end of the point and was about doubling it, when Herbert rose, and pointing out a black object, said:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What is that down there on the sand?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Every one looked in the direction indicated.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“There is something there, indeed,” said the reporter. “It looks like a wreck half buried in the sand.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Oh, I see what it is!” cried Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What?” asked Neb.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Barrels! they are barrels, and, may be, they are full!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“To shore, Pencroff!” said Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And with a few strokes the canoe was driven into a little cove, and the party went up the beach.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff was not mistaken. There were two barrels half buried in the sand; but firmly fastened to them was a large box, which, borne up by them, had been floated on to the shore.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Has there been a shipwreck here?” asked Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Evidently,” answered Spilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But what is in this box?” exclaimed Pencroff, with a natural impatience. “What is in this box? It is closed, and we have nothing with which to raise the lid. However, with a stone—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">And the sailor picked up a heavy rock, and was about to break one of the sides, when the engineer, stopping him, said:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Cannot you moderate your impatience for about an hour, Pencroff?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But, think, Mr. Smith! May be there is everything we want in it!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We will find out, Pencroff,” answered the engineer, “but do not break the box, as it will be useful. Let us transport it to Granite House, where we can readily open it without injuring it. It is all prepared for the voyage, and since it has floated here, it can float again to the river month.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You are right, sir, and I am wrong,” answered the sailor, “but one is not always his own master!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The engineer’s advice was good. It was likely that the canoe could not carry the things probably enclosed in the box, since the latter was so heavy that it had to be buoyed up by two empty barrels. It was, therefore, better to tow it in this condition to the shore at the Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And now the important question was, from whence came this jetsam? Smith and his companions searched the beach for several hundred paces, but there was nothing else to be seen. They scanned the sea, Herbert and Neb climbing up a high rock, but not a sail was visible on the horizon.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Nevertheless, there must have been a shipwreck, and perhaps this incident was connected with the incident of the bullet. Perhaps the strangers had landed upon another part of the island. Perhaps they were still there. But the natural conclusion of the colonists was that these strangers could not be Malay pirates, since the jetsam was evidently of European or American production.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They all went back to the box, which measured five feet by three. It was made of oak, covered with thick leather, studded with copper nails. The two large barrels, hermetically sealed, but which sounded empty, were fastened to its sides by means of strong ropes, tied in what Pencroff recognized to be “sailor’s knots.” That it was uninjured seemed to be accounted for by the fact of its having been thrown upon the sand instead of the rocks. And it was evident that it had not been long either in the sea or upon the beach. It seemed probable, also, that the water had not penetrated, and that its contents would be found uninjured. It therefore looked as if this box must have been thrown overboard from a disabled ship making for the island. And, in the hope that it would reach the island, where they would find it later, the passengers had taken the precaution to buoy it up.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We will tow this box to Granite House,” said the engineer, “and take an inventory of its contents; then, if we discover any of the survivors of this supposed shipwreck, we will return them what is theirs. If we find no one—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We will keep the things ourselves!” cried the sailor. “But I wish I knew what is in it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The sailor was already working at the prize, which would doubtless float at high water. One of the ropes which was fastened to the barrels was partly untwisted and served to fasten these latter to the canoe. Then, Neb and Pencroff dug out the sand with their oars, and soon the canoe, with the jetsam in tow, was rounding the promontory to which they gave the name of Jetsam Point. The box was so heavy that the barrels just sufficed to sustain it above the water; and Pencroff feared each moment that it would break loose and sink to the bottom. Fortunately his fears were groundless, and in an hour and a half the canoe touched the bank before Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The boat and the prize were drawn upon the shore, and as the tide was beginning to fall, both soon rested on dry ground. Neb brought some tools so as to open the box without injury, and the colonists forthwith proceeded to examine its contents.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff did not try to hide his anxiety. He began by unfastening the barrels, which would be useful in the future, then the fastenings were forced with pincers, and the cover taken off. A second envelope, of zinc, was enclosed within the case, in such a manner that its contents were impervious to moisture.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Oh!” cried Pencroff, “they must be preserves which are inside.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I hope for something better than that,” answered the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“If it should turn out that there was—” muttered the sailor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What?” asked Neb.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Nothing!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The zinc cover was split, lengthwise and turned back, and, little by little, many different objects were lifted out on the sand. At each new discovery Pencroff cheered, Herbert clapped his hands, and Neb danced. There were books which made the lad crazy with pleasure, and cooking implements which Neb covered with kisses.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In truth the colonists had reason to be satisfied, as the following inventory, copied from Spilett’s note-book, will show:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">TOOLS.—3 pocket-knives, with-several blades, 2 wood-chopper’s hatchets, 2 carpenter’s hatchets, 3 planes, I adzes, l axe, 6 cold chisels, 2 files, 3 hammers, 3 gimlets, 2 augers, 10 bags of nails and screws, 3 saws of different sizes, 2 boxes of needles.</p>
<p class="calibre3">ARMS.—2 flint-lock guns, 2 percussion guns, 2 central-fire carbines; 5 cutlasses, 4 boarding sabres, 2 barrels of powder, holding l5 pounds each, l2 boxes of caps.</p>
<p class="calibre3">INSTRUMENTS.—1 sextant, 1 opera-glass, 1 spyglass, 1 box compass, 1 pocket compass, 1 Fahrenheit thermometer, 1 aneroid barometer, 1 box containing a photographic apparatus, together with glasses, chemicals, etc.</p>
<p class="calibre3">CLOTHING.—2 dozen shirts of a peculiar material resembling wool, though evidently a vegetable substance; 3 dozen stockings of the same material.</p>
<p class="calibre3">UTENSILS.—1 Iron pot, 6 tinned copper stewpans, 3 iron plates, 10 aluminium knives and forks, 2 kettles, 1 small portable stove. 5 table knives.</p>
<p class="calibre3">BOOKS.-l Bible, 1 atlas, 1 dictionary of Polynesian languages, 1 dictionary of the Natural Sciences, 3 reams of blank paper, 2 blank books.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Unquestionably,” said the reporter, after the inventory had been taken, “the owner of this box was a practical man! Tools, arms, instruments, clothing, utensils, books, nothing is wanting. One would say that he had made ready for a shipwreck before-hand!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Nothing, Indeed, is wanting,” murmured Smith, thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And it is a sure thing,” added Herbert, “that the ship that brought this box was not a Malay pirate!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Unless its owner had been taken prisoner,” said Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That is not likely,” answered the reporter. “It is more probable that an American or European ship has been driven to this neighborhood, and that the passengers, wishing to save what was, at least, necessary, have prepared this box and have thrown it overboard.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And do you think so, Mr. Smith?” asked Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, my boy,” answered the engineer, “that might have been the case. It is possible, that, anticipating a ship wreck, this chest has been prepared, so that it might be found again on the coast—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But the photographic apparatus!” observed the sailor incredulously.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“As to that,” answered the engineer, “I do not see its use; what we, as well as any other ship wrecked person, would have valued more, would have been a greater assortment of clothing and more ammunition!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But have none of these things any mark by which we can tell where they came from,” askedSpilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They looked to see. Each article was examined attentively, but, contrary to custom, neither books, instruments, nor arms had any name or mark; nevertheless, they were in perfect order, and seemed never to have been used. So also with the tools and utensils; everything was new, and this went to prove that the things had not been hastily thrown together in the box, but that their selection had been made thoughtfully and with care. This, also, was evident from the zinc case which had kept everything watertight, and which could not have been soldered in a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The two dictionaries and the Bible were in English, and the latter showed that it had been often read. The Atlas was a splendid work, containing maps of every part of the world, and many charts laid out on Mercator’s Projection. The nomenclature in this book was in French, but neither in it, nor in any of the others, did the name of the editor or publisher appear.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists, therefore, were unable to even conjecture the nationality of the ship that had so recently passed near them. But no matter where it came from, this box enriched the party on Lincoln Island. Until now, in transforming the products of nature, they had created everything for themselves, and had succeeded by their own intelligence. Did it not now seem as if Providence had intended to reward them by placing these divers products of human industry in their hands? Therefore, with one accord, they all rendered thanks to Heaven.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Nevertheless, Pencroff was not entirely satisfied. It appeared that the box did not contain something to which he attached an immense importance, and as its contests lessened, his cheers had become less hearty, and when the inventory was closed, he murmured:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s all very fine, but you see there is nothing for me here!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why, what did you expect, Pencroff?” exclaimed Neb.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“A half pound of tobacco,” answered the sailor, “and then I would have been perfectly happy!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The discovery of this jetsam made the thorough exploration of the island more necessary than ever. It was, therefore, agreed that they should set out early the next morning, proceeding to the western coast via the Mercy. If anyone had been shipwrecked on that part of the island, they were doubtless without resources, and help must be given them at once.</p>
<p class="calibre3">During the day the contents of the box were carried to Granite House and arranged in order in the great hall. And that evening—the 29th of October—Herbert before retiring asked Mr. Smith to read some passages from the Bible.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Gladly,” answered the engineer, taking the sacred book in his hands; when Pencroff checking him, said:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Mr. Smith, I am superstitious. Open the book at random and read the first verse which you meet with. We will see if it applies to our situation.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith smiled at the words of the sailor, but yielding to his wishes he opened the Bible where the marker lay between the leaves. Instantly his eye fell upon a red cross made with a crayon, opposite the 8th verse of the seventh chapter of St. Matthew.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He read these words:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth.”</p>
<p class="calibre3"><a id="XXV"></a></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00039" class="calibre2">CHAPTER XXV.</h4>
<p class="calibre3">THE DEPARTURE—THE RISING TIDE—ELMS AND OTHER TREES—DIFFERENT PLANTS—THE KINGFISHER—APPEARANCE OF THE FOREST—THE GIGANTIC EUCALYPTI—WHY THEY ARE CALLED FEVER-TREES—MONKEYS—THE WATERFALL—ENCAMPMENT FOR THE NIGHT.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The next day—the 30th of October—everything was prepared for the proposed exploration, which these last events had made so necessary. Indeed, as things had turned out, the colonists could well imagine themselves in a condition to give, rather than to receive, help.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was agreed that they ascend the Mercy as far as practicable. They would thus be able to transport their arms and provisions a good part of the way without fatigue.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was also necessary to think, not only of what they now carried, but of what they might perhaps bring back to Granite House. If, as all thought, there had been a shipwreck on the coast, they would find many things they wanted on the shore, and the cart would doubtless have proved more convenient than the canoe. But the cart was so heavy and unwieldy that it would have been too hard work to drag it, which fact made Pencroff regret that the box had not only held his half-pound of tobacco, but also a pair of stout New Jersey horses, which would have been so useful to the colony.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The provisions, already packed by Neb, consisted of enough dried meat, beer, and fermented liquor to last them for the three days which Smith expected they would be absent. Moreover, they counted on being able to replenish their stock at need along the route, and Neb had taken care not to forget the portable stove.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They took the two wood-choppers’ hatchets to aid in making their way through the thick forest, and also the glass and the pocket compass.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Of the arms, they chose the two flint-lock guns in preference to the others, as the colonists could always renew the flints; whereas the caps could not be replaced. Nevertheless, they took one of the carbines and some cartridges. As for the powder, the barrels held fifty pounds, and it was necessary to take a certain amount of that; but the engineer expected to manufacture an explosive substance, by which it could be saved in the future. To the firearms they added the five cutlasses, in leather scabbards. And thus equipped, the party could venture into the forest with some chance of success.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Armed in this manner, Pencroff, Herbert, and Neb had all they could desire, although Smith made them promise not to fire a shot unnecessarily.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At 6 o’clock the party, accompanied by Top, started for the mouth of the Mercy. The tide had been rising half an hour, and there were therefore some hours yet of the flood which they could make use of. The current was strong, and they did not need to row to pass rapidly up between the high banks and the river. In a few minutes the explorers had reached the turn where, seven months before, Pencroff had made his first raft. Having passed this elbow, the river, flowing from the southwest, widened out under the shadow of the grand ever-green conifers; and Smith and his companions could not but admire the beautiful scenery. As they advanced the species of forest trees changed. On the right bank rose splendid specimens of ulmaceæ, those valuable elms so much sought after by builders, which have the property of remaining sound for a long time in water. There was, also, numerous groups belonging to the same family, among them the micocouliers, the root of which produces a useful oil. Herbert discovered some lardizabalaceæ, whose flexible branches, soaked in water, furnish excellent ropes, and two or three trunks of ebony of a beautiful black color, curiously veined.</p>
<p class="calibre3">From time to time, where a landing was easy, the canoe stopped, and Spilett, Herbert, and Pencroff, accompanied by Top, explored the bank. In addition to the game, Herbert thought that he might meet with some useful little plant which was not to be despised, and the young naturalist was rewarded by discovering a sort of wild spinach and numerous specimens of the genus cabbage, which would, doubtless, bear transplanting; they were cresses, horse-radishes, and a little, velvety, spreading plant, three-feet high, bearing brownish-colored seeds.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Do you know what this is?” asked Herbert of the sailor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Tobacco!” cried Pencroff, who had evidently never seen the plant which he fancied so much.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, Pencroff,” answered Herbert, “It is not tobacco, it is mustard.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Only mustard!” exclaimed the other. “Well if you happen to come across a tobacco plant, my boy, do not pass it by.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We will find it someday,” said Spilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“All right,” cried Pencroff, “and then I will be able to say that the island lacks nothing!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">These plants were taken up carefully and carried back to the canoe, where Cyrus Smith had remained absorbed in his own thoughts.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The reporter, Herbert, and Pencroff, made many of these excursions, sometimes on the right bank of the Mercy and sometimes upon the left. The latter was less abrupt, but more wooded. The engineer found, by reference to the pocket-compass, that the general direction of the river from its bend was southwest, and that it was nearly straight for about three miles. But it was probable that the direction would change further up, and that it would flow from the spurs of Mount Franklin, which fed its waters in the northwest.</p>
<p class="calibre3">During one of these excursions Spilett caught a couple of birds with long, slim beaks, slender necks, short wings, and no tails, which Herbert called tinamous, and which they resolved should be the first occupants of the future poultry-yard.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But the first report of a gun that echoed through the forests of the Far West, was provoked by the sight of a beautiful bird, resembling a kingfisher.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I know it,” cried Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What do you know?” asked the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That bird! It is the bird which escaped on our first exploration, the one after which we named this part of the forest!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“A jacamar!” exclaimed Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was, indeed, one of those beautiful birds, whose harsh plumage is covered with a metallic lustre. Some small shot dropped it to the earth, and Top brought it, and also some touracolories, climbing birds, the size of pigeons, to the canoe. The honor of this first shot belonged to the lad, who was pleased enough with the result. The touracolories were better game than the jacamar, the flash of the latter being tough, but it would have been hard to persuade Pencroff that they had not killed the most delicious of birds.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was 10 o’clock when the canoe reached the second bend of the river, some five miles from the mouth. Here they stopped half an hour, under the shadow of the trees, for breakfast.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The river measured from sixty to seventy feet in width, and was five or six feet deep. The engineer had remarked its several affluents, but they were simply unnavigable streams. The Forests of the Far West, or Jacamar Wood, extended farther than they could see, but no where could they detect the presence of man. If, therefore, any persons had been shipwrecked on the island, they had not yet quitted the shore, and it was not in those thick coverts that search must be made for the survivors.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The engineer began to manifest some anxiety to get to the western coast of the island, distant, as he calculated, about five miles or less. The journey was resumed, and, although the course of the Mercy, sometimes towards the shore, was oftener towards the mountain, it was thought better to follow it as long as possible, on account of the fatigue and loss of time incident to hewing a way through the wood. Soon, the tide having attained its height, Herbert and Neb took the oars, and Pencroff the paddle, wad they continued the ascent by rowing.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It seemed as if the forest of the Far West began to grow thinner. But, as the trees grew farther apart, they profited by the increased space, and attained a splendid growth.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eucalypti!” cried Herbert, descrying some of these superb plants, the loftiest giants of the extra-tropical zone, the congeners of the eucalypti of Australia and New Zealand, both of which countries were situated in the same latitude as Lincoln Island. Some rose 200 feet in height and measured twenty feet in circumference, and their bark, five fingers in thickness, exuded an aromatic resin. Equally wonderful were the enormous specimens of myrtle, their leaves extending edgewise to the sun, and permitting its rays to penetrate and fall upon the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What trees!” exclaimed Neb. “Are they good for anything?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Pshaw!” answered Pencroff. “They are like overgrown men, good for nothing but to show in fairs!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I think you’re wrong, Pencroff,” said Spilett, “the eucalyptus wood is beginning to be extensively used in cabinet work.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And I am sure,” added Herbert, “that it belongs to a most useful family,” and thereupon the young naturalist enumerated many species of the plant and their uses.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Every one listened to the lad’s lesson in botany, Smith smiling, Pencroff with an indescribable pride. “That’s all very well, Herbert,” answered the sailor, “but I dare swear that of all these useful specimens none are as large as these!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That is so.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then, that proves what I said,” replied the sailor, “that giants are good for nothing.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“There’s where you are wrong, Pencroff,” said the engineer, “these very eucalypti are good for something.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“For what?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“To render the country healthy about them. Do you know what they call them In Australia and New Zealand?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No sir.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“They call them ‘fever’ trees.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Because they give it?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No; because they prevent it!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Good. I shall make a note of that,” said the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Note then, my dear Spilett, that it has been proved that the presence of these trees neutralizes marsh miasmas. They have tried this natural remedy in certain unhealthy parts of Europe, and northern Africa, with the best results. And there are no intermittent fevers in the region of these forests, which is a fortunate thing for us colonists of Lincoln Island.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What a blessed island!” cried Pencroff. “It would lack nothing—if it was not—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That will come, Pencroff, we will find it,” answered the reporter; “but now let us attend to our work and push on as far as we can get with the canoe.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">They continued on through the woods two miles further, the river becoming more winding, shallow, and so narrow that Pencroff pushed along with a pole. The sun was setting, and, as it would be impossible to pass in the darkness through the five or six miles of unknown woods which the engineer estimated lay between them and the coast, it was determined to camp wherever the canoe was obliged to stop.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They now pushed on without delay through the forest, which grew more dense, and seemed more inhabited, because, if the sailor’s eyes did not deceive him, he perceived troops of monkeys running among the underbrush. Sometimes, two or three of these animals would halt at a distance from the canoe and regard its occupants, as if, seeing men for the first time, they had not then learned to fear them. It would have been easy to have shot some of these quadrumanes, but Smith was opposed to the useless slaughter. Pencroff, however, looked upon the monkey from a gastronomic point of view, and, indeed, as these animals are entirely herberiferous, they make excellent game; but since provisions abounded, it was useless to waste the ammunition.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Towards 4 o’clock the navigation of the Mercy became very difficult, its course being obstructed by rocks and aquatic plants. The banks rose higher and higher, and, already, the bed of the stream was confined between the outer spurs of Mount Franklin. Its sources could not be far off, since the waters were fed by the southern watershed of that mountain.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Before a quarter of an hour we will have to stop, sir,” said Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, then, we will make a camp for the night.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“How far are we from Granite House?” asked Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“About seven miles, counting the bends of the river, which have taken us to the northwest.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Shall we keep on?” asked the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, as far as we can get,” answered the engineer. “To-morrow, at daylight, we will leave the canoe, and traverse, in two hours I hope, the distance which separates us from the coast, and then we will have nearly the whole day in which to explore the shore.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Push on,” cried Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Very soon the canoe grated on the stones at the bottom of the river, which was not more than twenty feet wide. A thick mass of verdure overhung and descended the stream, and they heard the noise of a waterfall, which indicated that some little distance further on there existed a natural barrier.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And, indeed, at the last turn in the river, they saw the cascade shining through the trees. The canoe scraped over the bottom and then grounded on a rock near the right bank.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was 5 o’clock, and the level rays of the setting sun illuminated the little fall. Above, the Mercy, supplied from a secret source, was hidden by the bushes. The various streams together had made it a river, but here it was but a shallow, limpid brook.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They made camp in this lovely spot. Having disembarked, a fire was lighted under a group of micocouliers, in whose branches Smith and his companions could, if need be, find a refuge for the night.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Supper was soon finished, as they were very hungry, and then there was nothing to do but to go to sleep. But some suspicious growling being heard at nightfall, the fire was so arranged as to protect the sleepers by its flames. Neb and Pencroff kept it lit, and perhaps they were not mistaken in believing to have seen some moving shadows among the trees and bushes; but the night passed without accident, and the next day—the 31st of October—by 5 o’clock all were on foot ready for the start.</p>
<p class="calibre3"><a id="XXVI"></a></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00040" class="calibre2">CHAPTER XXVI.</h4>
<p class="calibre3">GOING TOWARD THE COAST—TROOPS OF MONKEYS—A NEW WATER-COURSE—WHY THE TIDE WAS NOT FELT—A FOREST ON THE SHORE—REPTILE PROMONTORY—SPILETT MAKES HERBERT ENVIOUS—THE BAMBOO FUSILADE.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was 6 o’clock when the colonists, after an early breakfast, started with the intention of reaching the coast by the shortest route. Smith had estimated that it would take them two hours, but it must depend largely on the nature of the obstacles in the way. This part of the Far West was covered with trees, like an immense thicket composed of many different species. It was, therefore, probable that they would have to make a way with hatchets in hand—and guns also, if they were to judge from the cries heard over night.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The exact position of the camp had been determined by the situation of Mount Franklin, and since the volcano rose less than three miles to the north, it was only necessary to go directly toward the southwest to reach the west coast.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After having seen to the mooring of the canoe, the party started, Neb and Pencroff carrying sufficient provisions to last the little troop for two days at least. They were no longer hunting, and the engineer recommended his companions to refrain from unnecessary firing, so as not to give warning of their presence on the coast. The first blows of the hatchet were given in the bushes just above the cascade, while Smith, compass in hand, indicated the route. The forest was, for the most part, composed of such trees as had already been recognized about the lake and on Prospect Plateau. The colonists could advance but slowly, and the engineer believed that in time their route would join with that of Red Creek.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Since their departure, the party had descended the low declivities which constituted the orography of the island, over a very dry district, although the luxuriant vegetation suggested either a hydrographic network permeating the ground beneath, or the proximity to some stream. Nevertheless, Smith did not remember having seen, during the excursion to the crater, any other water courses than Bed Creek and the Mercy.</p>
<p class="calibre3">During the first few hours of the march, they saw troops of monkeys, who manifested the greatest astonishment at the sight of human beings. Spilett laughingly asked if these robust quadrumanes did not look upon their party as degenerate brethren; and, in truth, the simple pedestrians, impeded at each step by the bushes, entangled in the lianas, stopped by tree trunks, did not compare favorably with these nimble animals, which bounded from branch to branch, moving about without hindrance. These monkeys were very numerous, but, fortunately, they did not manifest any hostile disposition.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They saw, also, some wild-boars, some agoutis, kangaroos, and other rodents, and two or three koulas, which latter Pencroff would have been glad to shoot.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But,” said he, “the hunt has not begun. Play now, my friends, and we will talk to you when we come back.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">At half-past 9, the route, which bore directly southwest, was suddenly interrupted by a rapid stream, rushing over rocks, and pent in between banks but thirty or forty feet apart. It was deep and clear, but absolutely unnavigable.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We are stopped!” cried Neb.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No,” replied Herbert; “we can swim such a brook as this.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why should we do that?” answered Smith. “It is certain that this creek empties into the sea. Let us keep to this bank and I will be astonished if it does not soon bring us to the coast. Come on!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“One minute,” said the reporter. “The name of this creek, my friends? We must not leave our geography incomplete.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“True enough,” said Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You name it, my boy,” said the engineer, addressing Herbert.</p>
