<p class="calibre3">“Right,” replied Smith, “let us push on.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Another minute,” exclaimed Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What more?” demanded the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“If hunting is forbidden, fishing is allowed, I suppose,” said the sailor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We haven’t the time to waste,” answered the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But just five minutes,” pleaded Pencroff; “I only want five minutes for the sake of breakfast!” And lying down on the bank he plunged his arms in the running waters and soon brought up several dozen of the fine crawfish which swarmed between the rocks.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“These will be good!” cried Neb, helping the sailor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Did not I tell you that the island had everything but tobacco?” sighed the sailor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It took but five minutes to fill a sack with these little blue crustaceæ, and then the journey was resumed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">By following the bank the colonists moved more freely. Now and then they found traces of large animals which came to the stream for water, but they found no sign of human beings, and they were not yet in that part of the Far West where the peccary had received the leaden pellet which cost Pencroff a tooth.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith and his companions judged, from the fact that the current rushed towards the sea with such rapidity, that they must be much farther from, the coast than they imagined, because at this time the tide was rising, and its’ effect would have been visible near the mouth of the creek. The engineer was greatly astonished, and often consulted his compass to be sure that the stream, was not returning towards the depths of the forest. Meantime, its waters, gradually widening, became less tumultuous. The growth of trees on the right bank was much denser than on the left, and it was impossible to see through this thicket; but these woods were certainly not inhabited, or Top would have discovered it. At half-past 10, to the extreme surprise of Smith, Herbert, who was walking some paces ahead, suddenly stopped, exclaiming, “The sea!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">And a few minutes later the colonists, standing upon the border of the forest, saw the western coast of the island spread before them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But what a contrast was this coast to the one on which chance had thrown them! No granite wall, no reef in the offing, not even a beach. The forest formed the shore, and its furthermost trees, washed by the waves, leaned over the waters. It was in no sense such a beach as is usually met with, composed of vast reaches of sand or heaps of rocks, but a fine border of beautiful trees. The bank was raised above the highest tides, and upon this rich soil, supported by a granite base, the splendid monarchs of the forest seemed to be as firmly set as were those which stood in the interior of the island.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists stood in a hollow by a tiny rivulet, which served as a neck to the other stream; but, curiously enough, these waters, instead of emptying into the sea by a gently sloping opening, fell from a height of more than forty feet—which fact explained why the rising tide did not affect the current. And, on this account, they were unanimous in giving this water-course the name of Fall River.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Beyond, towards the north, the forest shore extended for two miles; then the trees became thinner, and, still further on, a line of picturesque heights extended from north to south. On the other hand, all that part of the coast comprised between Fall River and the promontory of Reptile End was bordered by masses of magnificent trees, some upright and others leaning over the sea, whose waves lapped their roots. It was evidently, therefore, on this part of the coast that the exploration must be continued, as this shore offered to the castaways, whoever they might be, a refuge, which the other, desert and savage, had refused.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The weather was beautiful, and from the cliff where the breakfast had been prepared, the view extended far and wide. The horizon was perfectly distinct, without a sail in sight, and upon the coast, as far as could be seen, there was neither boat nor wreck, but the engineer was not willing to be satisfied in this respect, until they had explored the whole distance as far as Serpentine Peninsula.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After a hurried breakfast he gave the signal to start. Instead of traversing a beach, the colonists followed along the coast, under the trees. The distance to Reptile End was about twelve miles, and, had the way been clear, they could have accomplished it in four hours, but the party were constantly obliged to turn out from the way, or to cut branches, or to break through thickets, and these hindrances multiplied as they proceeded. But they saw no signs of a recent shipwreck on the shore; although, as Spilett observed, as the tide was up, they could not say with certainty that there had not been one.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This reasoning was just, and, moreover, the incident of the bullet proved, indubitably, that within three months a gun had been fired on the island.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At 5 o’clock the extremity of the peninsula was still two miles distant, and it was evident that the colonists would have to camp for the night on the promontory of Reptile End. Happily, game was as plenty here as on the other coast, and birds of different kinds abounded. Two hours later, the party, tired out, reached the promontory. Here the forest border ended, and the shore assumed the usual aspect of a coast. It was possible that an abandoned vessel might be here, but, as the night was falling, it was necessary to postpone the exploration until the morrow.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff and Herbert hastened to find a suitable place for a camp. The outskirts of the forest died away here, and near them the lad found a bamboo thicket.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Good,” said he, “this is a valuable discovery.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Valuable?” asked Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, indeed, I need not tell you, Pencroff, all its uses, such as for making baskets, paper, and water-pipes; that the larger ones make excellent building material and strong jars. But—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But perhaps you do not know that in India they eat bamboo as we do asparagus.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Asparagus thirty feet high?” cried, Pencroff. “And is it good?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Excellent,” answered the lad. “But they eat only the young sprouts.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Delicious!” cried Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And I am sure that the pith of young plants preserved in vinegar makes an excellent condiment.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Better and better.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And, lastly, they exude a sweet liquor which makes a pleasant drink.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Is that all?” demanded the sailor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s all.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Isn’t it good to smoke?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, my poor Pencroff, you cannot smoke it!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">They did not have to search far for a good place for the camp. The rocks, much worn by the action of the sea, had many hollows that would afford shelter from the wind. But just as they were about to enter one of these cavities they were arrested by formidable growlings.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Get back!” cried Pencroff, “we have only small shot in our guns, and these beasts would mind it no more than salt!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">And the sailor, seizing Herbert, dragged him behind some rocks, just as a huge jaguar appeared at the mouth of the cavern. Its skin was yellow, striped with black, and softened off with white under its belly. The beast advanced, and looked about. Its hair was bristling, and its eyes sparkling as if it was not scenting man for the first time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Just then Spilett appeared, coming round the high rocks, and Herbert, thinking he had not seen the jaguar, was about rushing towards him, when the reporter, motioning with his hand, continued his approach. It was not his first tiger.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Advancing within ten paces of the animal, he rested motionless, his gun at his shoulder, not a muscle quivering. The jaguar, crouching back, made a bound towards the hunter, but as it sprung a bullet struck it between the eyes, dropping it dead.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Herbert and Pencroff rushed to it, and Smith and Neb coming up at the moment, all stopped to look at the splendid animal lying at length upon the sand.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Oh, Mr. Spilett, how I envy you!” cried Herbert, in an excess of natural enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, my boy, you would have done as well,” answered the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I have been as cool as that!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Only imagine, Herbert, that a jaguar is a hare, and you will shoot him as unconcernedly as anything in the world! And now,” continued the reporter, “since the jaguar has left his retreat I don’t see, my friends, why we should not occupy the place during the night”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But some others may return!” said Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We will only have to light a fire at the entrance of the cavern,” said the reporter, “and they will not dare to cross the threshold.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“To the jaguar house, then,” cried the sailor, dragging the body of the animal after him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists went to the abandoned cave, and, while Neb was occupied in skinning the carcass, the others busied themselves with piling a great quantity of dry wood around the threshold. This done they installed themselves in the cave, whose floor was strewn with bones; the arms were loaded for an emergency; and, having eaten supper, as soon as the time for sleep was come, the fire at the entrance was lit.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Immediately a tremendous fusilade ensued! It was the bamboo which, in burning, exploded like fire-works! The noise, in itself, would have been sufficient to frighten off the bravest beasts.</p>
<p class="calibre3"><a id="XXVII"></a></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00041" class="calibre2">CHAPTER XXVII.</h4>
<p class="calibre3">PROPOSAL TO RETURN BY THE SOUTH COAST—ITS CONFIGURATION—SEARCH FOR THE SHIPWRECKED—A WAIF IN THE AIR—DISCOVERY OF A SMALL NATURAL HARBOR—MIDNIGHT ON THE MERCY—A DRIFTING CANOE.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith and his companions slept like mice in the cavern which the jaguar had so politely vacated, and, by sunrise, all were on the extremity of the promontory, and scrutinizing the horizon visible on either hand. No ship or wreck was to be seen, and not even with the spy-glass could any suspicious object be discerned. It was the same along the shore, at least on all that portion, three miles in length, which formed the south side of the promontory; as, beyond that, a slope of the land concealed the rest of the coast, and even from the extremity of Serpentine Peninsula, Claw Cape was hidden by high rocks.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The southern bank of the island remained to be explored. Had they not better attempt this at once, and give up this day to it? This procedure had not entered into their first calculations, as, when the canoe was left at the sources of the Mercy, the colonists thought that, having explored the west coast, they would return by the river; Smith having then believed that this coast sheltered either a wreck or a passing ship. But as soon as this shore disclosed no landing place, it became necessary to search the south side of the island for those whom they had failed to discover on the west.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was Spilett who proposed continuing the exploration so as to settle definitely the question of the supposed shipwreck, and he inquired how far it would be to Claw Cape.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“About thirty miles,” answered the engineer, “if we allow for the irregularity of the shore.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Thirty miles!” exclaimed Spilett, “that would be a long walk. Nevertheless, I think we should return to Granite House by the south coast.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But,” observed Herbert, “from Claw Cape to Granite House is at least ten miles further.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Call it forty miles altogether,” answered the reporter, “and do not let us hesitate to do it. At least we will have seen this unknown shore, and will not have it to explore over again.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That is so,” said Pencroff. “But how about the canoe?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The canoe can stay where it is for a day or two,” replied Spilett. “We can hardly say that the island is infested with thieves!” ‘</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Nevertheless, when I remember that affair of the turtle, I am not so confident.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The turtle! the turtle!” cried the reporter, “don’t you know that the sea turned it over?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Who can say?” murmured the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But—,” began Neb, who, it was evident, wished to say something.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What is it, Neb?” questioned the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“If we do return by the shore to Claw Cape, after having gone round it, we will be stopped—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“By the Mercy!” cried Herbert. “And we have no bridge or boat!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Oh!” answered Pencroff, “we can cross it readily enough with some logs.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Nevertheless,” said Spilett, “it would be well to build a bridge some time if we wish to have ready access to the Far West.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“A bridge!” cried Pencroff. “Well isn’t Mr. Smith State Engineer? If we shall need a bridge we will have one. As to carrying you over the Mercy to-night without getting wet, I will look out for that. We still have a day’s provision, which is all that is necessary, and, besides, the game may not give out to-day as It did yesterday. So let us go.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The proposal of the reporter, strongly seconded by the sailor, obtained general approval, as every one wished to end their doubts, and by returning by Claw Cape the exploration would be complete. But no time was to be lost, for the tramp was long, and they counted on reaching Granite House that night. So by 6 o’clock the little party was on its way, the guns loaded with ball in case of an encounter, and Top, who went ahead, ordered to search the edge of the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The first five miles of the distance was rapidly traversed, and not the slightest sign of any human being was seen. When the colonists arrived at the point where the curvature of the promontory ended, and Washington Bay began, they were able to take in at one view the whole extent of the southern coast. Twenty-five miles distant the shore was terminated by Claw Cape, which was faintly visible through the morning mists, and reproduced as a mirage in mid-air. Between the place occupied by the colonists and the upper end of the Great Bay the shore began with a flat and continuous beach, bordered in the background by tall trees; following this, it became very irregular, and thrust sharp points into the sea, and finally a heap of black rocks, thrown together in picturesque disorder, completed the distance to Claw Cape.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“A ship would surely be lost on these sands and shoals and reefs,” said Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is poor quarters!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But at least a portion of her would be left,” observed the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Some bits of wood would remain on the reefs, nothing on the sands,” answered the sailor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“How is that?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Because the sands are even more dangerous than the rocks, and swallow up everything that is thrown upon them; a few days suffice to bury out of sight the hull of a ship of many tons measurement.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then, Pencroff,” questioned the engineer, “if a vessel had been lost on these banks, it would not be surprising if there was no trace left?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, sir, that is after a time or after a tempest. Nevertheless, it would be surprising, as now, that no spars or timbers were thrown upon the shore beyond the reach of the sea.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let us continue our search,” replied Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">By 1 o’clock the party had accomplished twenty miles, having reached the upper end of Washington Bay, and they stopped to lunch.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Here began an irregular shore, oddly cut into by a long line of rocks, succeeding the sand banks, and just beginning to show themselves by long streaks of foam, above the undulations of the receding waves. From this point to Claw Cape the beach was narrow and confined between the reef of rocks and the forest, and the march would therefore be more difficult. The granite wall sunk more and more, and above it the tops of the trees, undisturbed by a breath of air, appeared in the background.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After half an hour’s rest the colonists took up the march again, on the lookout for any sign of a wreck, but without success. They found out, however, that edible mussels were plenty on this beach, although they would not gather them until means of transport between the two banks of the river should have been perfected.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Towards 3 o’clock, Smith and his companions reached a narrow inlet, unfed by any water-course. It formed a veritable little natural harbor, invisible from without, and approached by a narrow passage guarded by the reefs. At the upper end of this creek some violent convulsion had shattered the rock, and a narrow, sloping passage gave access to the upper plateau, which proved to be ten miles from Claw Cape, and therefore four miles in a direct line from Prospect Plateau.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Spilett proposed to his companions to halt here, and, as the march had sharpened their appetites, although it was not dinner time, no one objected to a bit of venison, and with this lunch they would be able to await supper at Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Soon the colonists, seated under a group of splendid pines, were eating heartily of the provisions which Neb had brought out from his haversack. The place was some fifty or sixty feet above the sea, and the view, extending beyond the furthest rock of the cape, was lost in Union Bay. But the islet and Prospect Plateau were invisible, as the high ground and the curtain of high trees shut out the horizon to the north. Neither over the extent of sea nor on that part of the coast which it was still necessary to explore could they discover even with the spyglass any suspicious object.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well” said Spilett, “we can console ourselves by thinking that no one is disputing the island with us.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But how about the pellet?” said Herbert. “It was not a dream.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Indeed it was not!” cried Pencroff, thinking of his missing tooth.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, what are we to conclude?” asked the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“This,” said Smith, “that within three months a ship, voluntarily or otherwise, has touched—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What! You will admit, Cyrus, that it has been swallowed up without leaving any trace?” cried the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, my dear Spilett; but you must remember that while it is certain that a human being has been here, it seems just as certain that he is not here now.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then, if I understand you sir,” said Herbert, “the ship has gone again?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Evidently.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And we have lost, beyond return, a chance to get home?” said Neb.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I believe without return.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well then, since the chance is lost, let us push on,” said Pencroff, already home-sick for Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But, just as they were rising, Top’s barking was heard, and the dog burst from the forest, holding in his mouth a soiled rag.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Neb took it from him. It was a bit of strong cloth. Top, still barking, seemed by his motions to invite his master to follow into the wood.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Here is something which will explain my bullet,” cried Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“A shipwrecked person!” answered Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Wounded, perhaps!” exclaimed Neb.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Or dead!” responded the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And all holding their arms in readiness, hurried after the dog through the outskirts of the forests. They advanced some distance into the wood, but, to their disappointment, they saw no tracks. The underbrush and lianas were uninjured and had to be cut away with the hatchet, as in the depths of the forest. It was hard to imagine that any human creature had passed there, and yet Top’s action showed no uncertainty, but was more like that of a human being having a fixed purpose.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In a few minutes the dog stopped. The colonists, who had arrived at a sort of glade surrounded by high trees, looked all about them, but neither in the underbrush or between the tree trunks could they discover a thing.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What is it, Top?” said Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Top, barking louder, ran to the foot of a gigantic pine.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Suddenly Pencroff exclaimed:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“This is capital!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What’s that,” asked Spilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We’ve been hunting for some waif on the sea or land—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And here it is in the air!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">And the sailor pointed out a mass of faded cloth caught on the summit of the pine, a piece of which Top had found on the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But that is no waif!” exclaimed Spilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Indeed it is,” answered Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“How is it!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is all that is left of our balloon, of our ship which is stranded on the top of this tree.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff was not mistaken, and he added, with a shout:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And there is good stuff in it which will keep us in linen for years. It will make us handkerchiefs and shirts. Aha, Mr. Spilett! what do you say of an island where shirts grow on the trees?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was, indeed, a fortunate thing for the colonists that the aerostat, after having made its last bound into the air, had fallen again on the island. They could, either keep the envelope in its present shape, in case they might desire to attempt a new flight through the air, or, after having taken off the varnish, they could make use of its hundreds of ells of good cotton cloth. At these thoughts all shared Pencroff’s joy.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was no easy task to take down this envelope from the tree top. But Neb, Herbert, and the sailor climbed up to it, and after two hours of hard work not only the envelope, with its valve, springs, and leather mountings, but the net, equivalent to a large quantity of cordage and ropes, together with the iron ring and the anchor, lay upon the ground. The envelope, excepting the rent, was in good order, and only its lower end had been torn away.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was a gift from heaven.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Nevertheless, Mr. Smith,” said the sailor, “if we ever do decide to leave the island it won’t be in a balloon, I hope. These air ships don’t always go the way you want them to, as we have found out. If you will let me have my way, we will build a ship of twenty tons, and you will allow me to cut from this cloth a foresail and jib. The rest of it will do for clothes.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We will see about it, Pencroff,” answered Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And meanwhile it must all be put away carefully,” said Neb.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In truth, they could not think of carrying all this weight of material to Granite House; and while waiting for a proper means of removing it, it was important not to leave it exposed to the weather. The colonists, uniting their efforts, succeeded in dragging it to the shore, where they discovered a cave so situated that neither wind, rain, nor sea could get at it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is a wardrobe,” said Pencroff; “but since it does not kick, it will be prudent to hide the opening, not, perhaps from two-footed, but from four-footed thieves!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">By 6 o’clock everything was stored away, and after having named the little inlet, Balloon, Harbor, they took the road for Claw Cape. Pencroff and the engineer discussed several projects, which it would be well to attend to at once. The first thing was to build a bridge across the Mercy, and, as the canoe was too small, to bring the balloon over in the cart. Then to build a decked launch, which Pencroff would make cutter-rigged, and in which they could make voyages of circumnavigation—around the island; then, etc.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the meantime the night approached, and it was already dark, when the colonists reached Jetsam Point, where they had discovered the precious box. But here, as elsewhere, there was nothing to indicate a shipwreck, and it became necessary to adopt the opinions expressed by Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The four miles from Jetsam Point to Granite House were quickly traversed, but it was midnight when the colonists arrived at the first bend above the mouth of the Mercy. There the river was eighty feet wide, and Pencroff, who had undertaken to overcome the difficulty of crossing it, set to work. It must be admitted that the colonists were fatigued. The tramp had been long, and the incident of the balloon had not rested their arms or legs. They were therefore anxious to get back to Granite House to supper and bed, and if they had only had the bridge, in a quarter of an hour they could have been at home.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The night was very dark. Pencroff and Neb, armed with the hatchets, chose two trees near the bank, and began cutting them down, in order to make a raft. Smith and Spilett, seated on the ground, waited to assist their companions, and Herbert sauntered about, doing nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre3">All at once the lad, who had gone up the stream, returned hurriedly, and, pointing back, exclaimed:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What is that drifting there?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff stopped work and perceived an object resting motionless in the gloom.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“A canoe!” he exclaimed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">All came up and saw, to their astonishment, a boat following the current.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Canoe, ahoy!” shouted Pencroff from force of habit, forgetting that it might be better to keep quiet.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There was no answer. The boat continued to drift, and it was not more than a dozen paces off, when the sailor exclaimed:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why, it’s our canoe! She has broken away and drifted down with the current. Well, we must admit that she comes in the nick of time!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Our canoe!” murmured the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff was right. It was indeed their canoe, which had doubtless broken loose and drifted all the way from the headwaters of the Mercy! It was important to seize it in passing before it should be drawn into the rapid current at the mouth of the river, and Pencroff and Neb, by the aid of a long pole, did this, and drew the canoe to the bank.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The engineer stepped in first, and, seizing the rope, assured himself that it had been really worn in two against the rocks.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“This,” said the reporter in an undertone; “this is a coincidence—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is very strange!” answered the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At least it was fortunate, and while no one could doubt that the rope had been broken by friction, the astonishing part of the affair was that the canoe had arrived at the moment when the colonists were there to seize it, for a quarter of an hour later, and it would have been carried out to sea. Had there been such things as genii, this incident would have been sufficient to make the colonists believe that the island was inhabited by a supernatural being, who placed his power at their disposal.</p>
<p class="calibre3">With a few strokes the party arrived at the mouth of the Mercy. The canoe was drawn on shore at the Chimneys, and all took their way to the ladder at Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But, just then, Top began barking furiously, and Neb, who was feeling for the lower rung, cried out:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The ladder’s gone!”</p>
<p class="calibre3"><a id="XXVIII"></a></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00042" class="calibre2">CHAPTER XXVIII</h4>
<p class="calibre3">PENCROFF’S HALLOOS—A NIGHT IN THE CHIMNEYS—HERBERT’S ARROW—SMITH’S PLAN—AN UNEXPECTED SOLUTION—WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN GRANITE HOUSE—HOW THE COLONISTS OBTAINED A NEW DOMESTIC.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith stood silent. His companions searched in the obscurity along the wall, over the ground, for the broken part of the ladder, supposing it had been torn off by the wind. But the ladder had certainly disappeared, although it was impossible to tell in the darkness whether a gust of wind had not carried it up and lodged it on the first ledge.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“If this is a joke, it’s a pretty poor one,” cried Pencroff. “To get home and not be able to find the staircase, won’t do for tired men.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Neb stood in open-mouthed amazement.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It could not have been carried away by the wind!” said Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’m beginning to think that strange things happen in Lincoln Island!” said Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Strange?” rejoined Spilett. “Why no, Pencroff, nothing is more natural. Somebody has come while we have been absent, and has taken possession of the house and drawn up the ladder!”.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Some one!” cried the sailor. “Who could it be?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why, the man who shot the bullet,” answered the reporter “How else can you explain it?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Very well, if any one is up there,” replied Pencroff, beginning to get angry, “I will hail him, and he had better answer.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">And in a voice of thunder the sailor gave a prolonged “Ohe,” which was loudly repeated by the echoes.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists listened, and thought that they heard a sort of chuckling proceed from Granite House. But there was no answering voice to the sailor, who repeated his appeal in vain.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Here was an event that would have astonished people the most indifferent, and from their situation the colonists could not be that. To them, the slightest incident was of moment, and certainly during their seven months’ residence nothing equal to this had happened.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They stood there at the foot of Granite House not knowing what to do or to say. Neb was disconsolate at not being able to get back to the kitchen, especially as the provisions taken for the journey had all been eaten, and they had no present means of renewing them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“There is but one thing to do, my friends,” said Smith, “to wait until daylight, and then to be governed by circumstances. Meanwhile let us go to the Chimneys, where we will be sheltered, and, even if we cannot eat, we can sleep.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But who is the ill-mannered fellow that has played us this trick?” asked Pencroff again, who thought it no joke.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Whoever he was, there was nothing to do but to follow the engineer’s advice. Top having been ordered to lie down under the windows of Granite House, took his place without complaint. The brave dog remained at the foot of the wall, while his master and his companions took shelter among the rocks.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists, tired as they were, slept but little. Not only were their beds uncomfortable, but it was certain that their house was occupied at present, and they were unable to get into it. Now Granite House was not only their dwelling, it was their storehouse. Everything they possessed was stored there. It would be a serious thing if this should be pillaged and they should have again to begin at the beginning. In their anxiety, one or the other went out often to see if the dog remained on watch. Smith, alone, waited with his accustomed patience, although he was exasperated at finding himself confronted by something utterly inexplicable, and his reason shrank from the thought that around him, over him, perhaps, was exercising an influence to which he could give no name. Spilett sharing his thoughts, they conversed together in an undertone of those unaccountable events which defied all their knowledge and experience. Certainly, there was a mystery about this island, but how discover it? Even Herbert did not know what to think, and often questioned Smith. As to Neb, he said that this was his master’s business and not his; and if he had not feared offending his companions, the brave fellow would have slept this night as soundly as if he had been in his bed in Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff, however, was very much put out.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It’s a joke,” he said. “It’s a joke that is played on us. Well, I don’t like such jokes, and the joker won’t like it, if I catch him!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">At dawn the colonists, well armed, followed along the shore to the reefs. By 5 o’clock the closed windows of Granite House appeared through their leafy curtain. Everything, from this side, appeared to be in order, but an exclamation escaped from the colonists when they perceived that the door which they had left closed was wide open. There could be no more doubt that some one was in Granite House, The upper ladder was in its place; but the lower had been drawn up to the threshold. It was evident that the intruders wished to guard against a surprise. As to telling who or how many they were, that was still impossible, as none had yet shown themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff shouted again, but without answer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The beggars!” he exclaimed, “to sleep as soundly as if they were at home! Halloo! pirates! bandits! corsairs! sons of John Bull!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When Pencroff, as an American, called any one a “son of John Bull,” he had reached the acme of insult.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Just then, the day broke and the facade of Granite House was illuminated by the rays of the rising sun. But inside as well as without all was still and calm. It was evident from the position of the ladder that whoever had been inside the house had not come out. But how could they get up to them?</p>
<p class="calibre3">Herbert conceived the idea of shooting an arrow attached to a cord between the lower rungs of the ladder which were hanging from the doorway: They would thus be able by means of the cord to pull this ladder down, and gain access to Granite House. There was evidently nothing else to do, and with a little skill this attempt might prove successful. Fortunately there were bows and arrows at the Chimneys, and they found there, also, some twenty fathoms of light hibiscus cord. Pencroff unrolled this, and fastened the end to a well-feathered arrow. Then Herbert having placed the arrow in his bow took careful aim at the hanging part of the ladder.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The others stationed themselves some distance in the background to observe what might happen, and the reporter covered the doorway with his carbine.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The bow bent, the arrow shot upward with the cord, and passed between the two lower rungs of the ladder. The operation had succeeded. But just as Herbert, having caught the end of the cord, was about giving it a pull to make the ladder fall, an arm thrust quickly between the door and the wall seized the ladder and drew it within Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You little beggar!” cried Pencroff. “If a ball would settle you, you would not have to wait long!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But what is it?” demanded Neb.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What! didn’t you see?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why, it’s a monkey, a macauco, a sapajo, an orang, a baboon, a gorilla, a sagoin! Our house has been invaded by monkeys, which have climbed up the ladder while we were away.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">And at the moment, as if to prove the truth of what the sailor said, three or four quadrumana threw open the window shutters and saluted the true proprietors of the place with a thousand contortions and grimaces.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I knew all the time it was a joke,” cried Pencroff, “But here’s one of the jokers that will pay for the others!” he added, covering a monkey with his gun and firing. All disappeared but, this one, which, mortally wounded, fell to the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This monkey was very large and evidently belonged to the first order of quadrumana. Whether a chimpanzee, an orang, a gorilla, or a gibbon, it ranked among these anthropomorphi, so called on account of their likeness to the human race. Herbert declared it was an orang-outang, and we all know that the lad understood zoology.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What a fine beast!” cried Neb.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“As fine as you choose!” answered the reporter, “but I don’t see yet how we are going to get in!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Herbert is a good shot,” said the reporter, “and his bow is sure! We will try again—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But these monkeys are mischievous,” cried Pencroff, “and if they don’t come to the windows, we cannot shoot them; and when I think of the damage they can do in the rooms and, in the magazine—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Have patience,” answered Smith. “These animals cannot hold us in check, very long.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I will be sure of that when they are out of there, “rejoined Pencroff, “Can you say how many dozens of these fools there may be?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">It would hare been hard to answer Pencroff, but it was harder to try again the experiment of the arrow, as the lower end of the ladder had been drawn within the doorway, and when they pulled on the cord again, it broke, and the ladder remained, as before.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was, Indeed, vexatious. Pencroff was in a fury, and, although the situation had a certain comic aspect, he did not think it funny at all. It was evident that the colonists would, eventually, get back into their house and drive out the monkeys, but when and how they could not say.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Two hours passed, during which the monkeys avoided showing themselves; but they were there, for all that, and, two or three times, a muzzle or paw slipped by the door or the windows, and was saluted by a shot.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let us conceal ourselves,” said the engineer, at length. “And then the monkeys will think we have gone off, and will show themselves again. Let Herbert and Spilett remain hidden behind the rocks and fire on any that appear.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The directions of the engineer were followed, and while the reporter and the lad, who were the best shots in the party, took their positions, the others went over the plateau to the forest to shoot some game, as it was breakfast time and they had no food.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In half an hour the hunters returned with some wild pigeons, which would be pretty good roasted. Not a monkey had shown itself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Spilett and Herbert went to their breakfast, while Top kept watch under the windows. Then they returned to their post. Two hours later the situation was unchanged. The quadrumana gave no sign of existence, and it seemed as if they must have disappeared; but it was more likely that, frightened by the death of one of their number and the detonations of the guns, they kept themselves hidden in the chambers or the store-room of Granite House. And, when the colonists thought of all that was stored in this latter room, the patience which the engineer had recommended turned into irritation, and indeed they could not be blamed for it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is too bad!” exclaimed the reporter, at length; “and is there no way we can put an end to this?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We must make these beggars give up!” cried Pencroff. “We can readily do it, even if there are twenty of them, in a hand-to hand fight! Oh, is there no way we can get at them?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes,” replied Smith, struck by an idea.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Only one?” rejoined Pencroff. “Well, that’s better than none at all. What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Try to get into Granite House by the old weir,” answered the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why in the mischief didn’t I think of that!” cried the sailor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This was, indeed, the only way to get into Granite House, in order to fight the band and drive them out. It is true that, if they tore down the cemented wall which closed the weir, the work would have all to be done over again; but, fortunately, Smith had not yet effected his design of hiding this opening by covering it again with the lake, as that operation necessitated a good deal of time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was already past noon when the colonists, well armed and furnished with picks and mattocks, left the Chimneys, passed under the windows of Granite House, and, having ordered Top to remain at his post, made ready to climb the left bank of the Mercy, so as to reach Prospect Plateau. But they had hardly gone fifty paces, when they heard the loud barkings of the dog, as if making a desperate appeal. All halted.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let us run back,” cried Pencroff. And all did as proposed as fast as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Arrived at the turn, the whole situation was changed. The monkeys, seized with a sudden fright, startled by some unknown cause, were trying to escape. Two or three were running and springing from window to window, with the agility of clowns. In their fright they seemed to have forgotten to replace the ladder, by which they could easily have descended. In a moment half a dozen were in such a position that they could be shot, and the colonists, taking aim, fired. Some fell, wounded or killed, within the chambers, uttering sharp cries. Others, falling to the ground without, were crushed by the fall, and a few moments afterwards it seemed as if there was not one living quadrumana in Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hurrah,” said Pencroff, “hurrah, hurrah!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Don’t cheer yet,” saidSpilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why not,” asked Pencroff. “Ain’t they all killed.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Doubtless: but that does not give us the means of getting in.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let us go the weir!” exclaimed Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We will have to,” said the engineer. “Nevertheless it would have been preferable—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">And at the instant, as if in answer to the observation of the engineer, they saw the ladder slide over the door-sill and roll over to the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“By the thousand pipes, but that is lucky!” cried Pencroff, looking at Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Too lucky!” muttered Smith, springing up the ladder.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Take care, Mr. Smith!” exclaimed Pencroff, “if there should be any sojourners—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We will soon see,” responded the other.</p>
<p class="calibre3">All his companions followed him and in a moment were within the doorway.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They searched everywhere. No one was in the chambers or in the storeroom, which remained undisturbed by the quadrumana.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And the ladder,” said Pencroff; “where is the gentleman who pushed it down to us?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">But just then a cry was heard, and a huge monkey, that had taken refuge in the corridor, sprang into the great hall, followed by Neb.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ah, the thief!” cried Pencroff, about to spring with his hatchet at the head of the animal, when Smith stopped him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Spare it, Pencroff.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What, spare this black ape?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, it is he that has thrown us the ladder,” said the engineer, in a voice so strange, that it was hard to say whether he was in earnest or not.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Nevertheless, all threw themselves on the monkey, which, after a brave resistance, was thrown down and tied.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ugh!” exclaimed Pencroff; “and now what will we do with it?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Make a servant of it,” answered Herbert, half in earnest, as the lad knew how great was the intelligence of this race of quadrumana.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists gathered round the monkey and examined it attentively. It appeared to belong to that species of anthropomorphi in which the facial angle is not visibly inferior to that of the Australians or Hottentots. He was an orang of the kind which has neither the ferocity of the baboon nor the macauco, nor the thoughtlessness of the sagoin, nor the impatience of the magot, nor the bad instincts of the cynocephalous. It was of a family of anthropomorphi which has traits indicating a half-human intelligence. Employed in houses, they can wait on the table, do chamber-work, brush clothes, black boots, clean the knives and forks, and—empty the bottles, as well as the best trained flunkey. Buffon possessed one of these monkeys, which served him a long time as a zealous and faithful servant.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The one at present tied in the hall of Granite House was a big fellow, six feet high, deep-chested, and finely built, a medium-sized head, with a sharp facial angle, a well-rounded skull, and a prominent nose, and a skin covered with smooth hair, soft and shining,—in short, a finished type of anthropomorphi. Its eyes, somewhat smaller than those of a human being, sparkled with intelligence; its teeth glistened beneath its moustache, and it wore a small nut-brown beard.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“He is a fine chap,” said Pencroff. “If we only understood his language, one might talk with him!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then,” said Neb, “are they in earnest, my master? Will we take it as a domestic?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, Neb,” said the engineer, smiling. “But you need not be jealous.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And I hope it will make an excellent servant. As it is young its education will be easy, and we will not have to use force to make it mind, nor to pull out its teeth as is sometimes done. It cannot fail to become attached to masters who only treat it well.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And we will do that,” said Pencroff, who having forgotten his recent wrath against the “jokers,” approached the orang and accosted him with:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hullo, my boy, how goes it?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The orang responded with a little grunt, which seemed to denote a not bad temper.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You want to join the colony, do you? Would you like to enter the service of Mr. Smith?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The monkey gave another affirmative grunt.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And you’ll be satisfied with your board as wages?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">A third affirmative grunt.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“His conversation is a little monotonous,” observed Spilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well,” replied Pencroff, “the best domestics are those that speak least. And then, no wages! Do you hear, my boy? At first we give you no wages, but we will double them later, if you suit us!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Thus the colonists added to their number one who had already done them a service. As to a name, the sailor asked that he should be called, in remembrance of another monkey, Jupiter, or by abbreviation, Jup. And thus, without more ado, Master Jup was installed in Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3"><a id="XXIX"></a></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00043" class="calibre2">CHAPTER XXIX.</h4>
<p class="calibre3">PROJECTS TO BE CARRIED OUT—A BRIDGE OVER THE MERCY—TO MAKE AN ISLAND OF PROSPECT PLATEAU—THE DRAW-BRIDGE—THE CORN HARVEST—THE STREAM—THE CAUSEWAY—THE POULTRY YARD—THE PIGEON-HOUSE—THE TWO WILD ASSES—HARNESSED TO THE WAGON—EXCURSION TO BALLOON HARBOR.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists had now reconquered their domicile without having been obliged to follow the weir. It was, indeed, fortunate, that at the moment they decided to destroy their masonry, the band of monkeys, struck by a terror not less sudden than inexplicable, had rushed from Granite House. Had these animals a presentiment that a dangerous attack was about to be made on them from another direction? This was the only way to account for their retreat.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The rest of the day was occupied in carrying the dead monkeys to the wood and burying them there, and in repairing the disorder made by the intruders,—disorder and not damage, as, though they had upset the furniture in the rooms, they had broken nothing. Neb rekindled the range, and the supply in the pantry furnished a substantial repast that was duly honored.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Jup was not forgotten, and he ate with avidity the pistachio nuts and the roots of the sumach, with which he saw himself abundantly provided. Pencroff had unfastened his arms, although he thought it best to keep the monkey’s legs bound until they could be sure he had surrendered.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Seated at the table, before going to bed, Smith and his companions discussed three projects, the execution of which was urgent. The most important and the most pressing was the establishment of a bridge across the Mercy, then the building of a corral, designed for the accommodation of moufflons or other woolly animals which they had agreed to capture. These two plans tended to solve the question of clothing, which was then the most serious question.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was Smith’s intention to establish this corral at the sources of Red Creek, where there was abundant pasturage. Already the path between there and Prospect Plateau was partially cleared, and with a better constructed cart, carriage would be easy, especially if they should capture some animal that could draw it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But while it would not be inconvenient to have the corral some distance from Granite House, it was different with the poultry-yard, to which Neb called attention. It was necessary that the “chickens” should be at the hand of the cook, and no place seemed more favorable for an establishment of this kind than that portion of the lake shore bordering on the former weir. The aquatic birds also would thrive there, and the pair of tinamons, taken in the last excursion, would serve as a beginning.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The next day—the 3d of November—work was begun on the bridge, and all hands were required on the important undertaking. Laden with tools the colonists descended to the shore.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Here Pencroff reflected as follows:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Supposing while we are away Master Jup takes the notion of hauling up the ladder, which he so gallantly unrolled for us yesterday.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We would be dependent on his tail!” answered Spilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The ladder was therefore made fast to two stakes driven firmly into the ground. The colonists ascended the river, and soon arrived at its narrow bend, where they halted to examine whether the bridge could not be thrown across at this place. The situation was suitable, as from this point to Balloon Harbor the distance was three miles and a half, and a wagon road connecting Granite House with the southern part of the island, could easily be constructed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then Smith communicated to his companions a project which he had had in view for some time. This was to completely isolate Prospect Plateau, so as to protect it from all attacks of quadrupeds or quadrumana. By this means Granite House, the Chimneys, the poultry yard, and all the upper part of the plateau destined for sowing would be protected against the depredations of animals.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Nothing could be easier than to do this, and the engineer proposed to accomplish it as follows:—The plateau was already protected on three sides by either natural or artificial water courses. On the northwest, by the bank of Lake Grant, extending from the angle against the former weir to the cut made in the east bank to draw off the water. On the north, by this new water course which had worn itself a bed both above and below the fall, which could be dug out sufficiently to render the passage impracticable to animals. And upon the east, by the sea itself, from the mouth of this new creek to the mouth of the Mercy. Therefore the only part remaining open was the western part of the plateau included between the bend in the river and the southern angle of the lake, a distance of leas than a mile. But nothing could be easier than to dig a ditch, wide and deep, which would be filled from the lake, and flow into the Mercy. Doubtless the level of the lake would be lowered somewhat by this new drain on its resources, but Smith had assured himself that the flow of Red Creek was sufficient for his purpose.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Thus,” added the engineer, “Prospect Plateau will be a veritable island, unconnected with the rest of our domain, save by the bridge which we will throw over the Mercy, by the two causeways already built above and below the fall, and by the two others which are to be constructed, one over the proposed ditch, and the other over the left bank of the Mercy. Now if this bridge and the causeways can be raised at will, Prospect Plateau will be secured from surprise.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith, in order to make his companions comprehend clearly his plans, had made a plot of the plateau, and his project was rendered perfectly plain. It met with unanimous approval; and Pencroff, brandishing his hatchet, exclaimed:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And first, for the bridge!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">This work was the most urgent. Trees were selected, felled, lopped, and cut into beams, planks, and boards. The bridge was to be stationary on the right bank of the Mercy, but on the left it was to be so constructed as to raise by means of counterweights, as in some draw-bridges.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It will be seen that this work, even if it could be easily accomplished, would take considerable time, as the Mercy was eighty feet wide at this point. It was first necessary to drive piles in the bed of the river, to sustain the flooring of the bridge, and to set up a pile-driver to drive the piles, so as to form two arches capable of supporting heavy weights.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Fortunately they lacked neither the necessary tools for preparing the timber, nor the iron work, to bind it together, nor the ingenuity of a man who was an adept at this sort of work, nor, finally, the zeal of his companions who in these seven months had necessarily acquired considerable manual skill. And it should be added that Spilett began to do nearly as well as the sailor himself “who would never have expected so much from a newspaper man!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">It took three weeks of steady work to build this bridge. And as the weather was fine they lunched on the ground, and only returned to Granite House for supper.</p>
<p class="calibre3">During this period it was observed that Master Jup took kindly to and familiarized himself with his new masters, whom he watched with the greatest curiosity. Nevertheless, Pencroff was careful not to give him complete liberty until the limits of the plateau had been rendered impassible. Top and he were the best possible friends, and got on capitally together although Jup took everything gravely.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The bridge was finished on the 20th of November. The movable part balanced perfectly with the counterpoise, and needed but little effort to raise it; between the hinge and crossbeam on which the draw rested when closed, the distance was twenty feet, a gap sufficiently wide to prevent animals from getting across.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was next proposed to go for the envelope of the balloon, which the colonists were anxious to place in safety; but in order to bring it, the cart would have to be dragged to Balloon Harbor, necessitating the breaking of a road through the dense underwood of the Far West, all of which would take time. Therefore Neb and Pencroff made an excursion to the harbor, and as they reported that the supply of cloth was well protected in the cave, it was decided that the works about the plateau should not be discontinued.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“This,” said Pencroff, “will enable us to establish the poultry-yard under the most advantageous conditions, since we need have no fear of the visits of foxes or other noxious animals.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And also,” added Neb, “we can clear the plateau, and transplant wild plants”—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And make ready our second corn-field,” continued the sailor with a triumphant air.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Indeed the first corn-field, sowed with a single grain, had prospered admirably, thanks to the care of Pencroff. It had produced the ten ears foretold by the engineer, and as each ear had eighty grains, the colonists found themselves possessed of 800 grains—in six months—which promised them a double harvest each year. These 800 grains, excepting fifty which it was prudent to reserve, were now about to be sowed in a new field with as much care as the first solitary specimen.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The field was prepared, and inclosed with high, sharp-pointed palisades, which quadrupeds would have found very difficult to surmount. As to the birds, the noisy whirligigs and astonishing scarecrows, the product of Pencroff’s genius, were enough to keep them at a distance. Then the 750 grains were buried in little hills, regularly disposed, and Nature was left to do the rest.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the 21st of November, Smith began laying out the ditch which was to enclose the plateau on the west. There were two or three feet of vegetable earth, and beneath that the granite. It was, therefore, necessary to manufacture some more nitro-glycerine, and the nitro-glycerine had its accustomed effect. In less than a fortnight a ditch, twelve feet wide and six feet deep was excavated in the plateau. A new outlet was in like manner made in the rocky border of the lake, and the waters rushed into this new channel, forming a small stream, to which they gave the name of Glycerine Creek. As the engineer had foreseen the level of the lake was lowered but very slightly. Finally, for completing the enclosure, the bed of the stream across the beach was considerably enlarged, and the sand was kept up by a double palisade.</p>
<p class="calibre3">By the middle of December all these works were completed, and Prospect Plateau, shaped something like an irregular pentagon, having a perimeter of about four miles, was encircled with a liquid belt, making it absolutely safe from all aggression.</p>
<p class="calibre3">During this month the heat was very great. Nevertheless, the colonists, not wishing to cease work, proceeded to construct the poultry-yard. Jup, who since the enclosing of the plateau had been given his liberty, never quitted his masters nor manifested the least desire to escape. He was a gentle beast, though possessing immense strength and wonderful agility. No one could go up the ladder to Granite House as he could. Already he was given employment; he was instructed to fetch wood and carry off the stones which had been taken from the bed of Glycerine Creek.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Although he’s not yet a mason, he is already a ‘monkey,’“ said Herbert, making a joking allusion to the nickname masons give their apprentices. And if ever a name was well applied, it was so in this instance!</p>
<p class="calibre3">The poultry-yard occupied an area of 200 square yards on the southeast bank of the lake. It was enclosed with a palisade, and within were separate divisions for the proposed inhabitants, and huts of branches divided into compartments awaiting their occupants.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The first was the pair of tinamons, who were not long in breeding numerous little ones. They had for companions half-a-dozen ducks, who were always by the water-side. Some of these belonged to that Chinese variety whose wings open like a fan, and whose plumage rivals in brilliance that of the golden pheasant. Some days later, Herbert caught a pair of magnificent curassows, birds of the gallinaceæ family, with long rounding tails. These soon bred others, and as to the pellicans, the kingfishers, the moorhens, they came of themselves to the poultry-yard. And soon, all this little world, after some disputing, cooing, scolding, clucking, ended by agreeing and multiplying at a rate sufficient for the future wants of the colony.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith, in order to complete his work, established a pigeon-house in the corner of the poultry-yard, and placed therein a dozen wild pigeons. These birds readily habituated themselves to their new abode, and returned there each evening, showing a greater propensity to domestication than the wood pigeons, their congeners, which do not breed except in a savage state.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And now the time was come to make use of the envelope in the manufacture of clothing, for to keep it intact in order to attempt to leave the island by risking themselves in a balloon filled with heated air over a sea, which might be called limitless, was only to be thought of by men deprived of all other resources, and Smith, being eminently practical, did not dream of such a thing.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was necessary to bring the envelope to Granite House, and the colonists busied themselves in making their heavy cart less unwieldly and lighter. But though the vehicle was provided, the motor was still to be found! Did not there exist in the island some ruminant of indiginous species which could replace the horse, ass, ox, or cow? That was the question.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Indeed,” said Pencroff, “a draught animal would be very useful to us, while we are waiting until Mr. Smith is ready to build a steam-wagon or a locomotive, though doubtless, some day we will have a railway to Balloon Harbor, with a branch road up Mount Franklin!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">And the honest sailor, in talking thus, believed what he said. Such is the power of imagination combined with faith!</p>
<p class="calibre3">But, in truth, an animal capable of being harnessed would have just suited Pencroff, and as Fortune favored him, she did not let him want.</p>
<p class="calibre3">One day, the 23d of December, the colonists, busy at the Chimneys, heard Neb crying and Top barking in such emulation, that dreading some terrible accident, they ran to them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">What did they see? Two large, beautiful animals, which had imprudently ventured upon the plateau, the causeways not having been closed. They seemed like two horses, or rather two asses, male and female, finely shaped, of a light bay color, striped with black on the head, neck, and body, and with white legs and tail. They advanced tranquilly, without showing any fear, and looked calmly on these men in whom they had not yet recognized their masters.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“They are onagers,” cried Herbert. “Quadrupeds of a kind between the zebra and the quagga.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why aren’t they asses?” asked Neb.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Because they have not long ears, and their forms are more graceful.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Asses or horses,” added Pencroff—“they are what Mr. Smith would call “motors,” and it will be well to capture them!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The sailor, without startling the animals, slid through the grass to the causeway over Glycerine Creek, raised it, and the onagers were prisoners. Should they be taken by violence, and made to submit to a forced domestication? No. It was decided that for some days they would let these animals wander at will over the plateau where the grass was abundant, and a stable was at once constructed near to the poultry-yard in which the onagers would find a good bedding, and a refuge for the night.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The fine pair were thus left entirely at liberty, and the colonists avoided approaching them. In the meantime the onagers often tried to quit the plateau, which was too confined for them, accustomed to wide ranges and deep forests. The colonists saw them following around the belt of water impossible to cross, whinnying and galloping over the grass, and then resting quietly for hours regarding the deep woods from which they were shut off.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the meantime, harness had been made from vegetable fibres, and some days after the capture of the onagers, not only was the cart ready, but a road, or rather a cut, had been made through the forest all the way from the bend in the Mercy to Balloon Harbor. They could therefore get to this latter place with the cart, and towards the end of the month the onagers were tried for the first time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff had already coaxed these animals so that they ate from his hand, and he could approach them without difficulty, but, once harnessed, they reared and kicked, and were with difficulty kept from breaking loose, although it was not long before they submitted to this new service.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This day, every one except Pencroff, who walked beside his team, rode in the cart to Balloon Harbor. They were jolted about a little over this rough road, but the cart did not break down, and they were able to load it, the same day, with the envelope and the appurtenances to the balloon.</p>
<p class="calibre3">By 8 o’clock in the evening, the cart, having recrossed the bridge, followed down the bank of the Mercy and stopped on the beach. The onagers were unharnessed, placed in the stable, and Pencroff, before sleeping, gave a sigh of satisfaction that resounded throughout Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3"><a id="XXX"></a></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00044" class="calibre2">CHAPTER XXX.</h4>
<p class="calibre3">CLOTHING—SEAL-SKIN BOOTS—MAKING PYROXYLINE—PLANTING—THE FISH—TURTLES’ EGGS—JUP’S EDUCATION—THE CORRAL-HUNTING MOUFFLONS—OTHER USEFUL ANIMALS AND VEGETABLES—HOME THOUGHTS.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The first week In January was devoted to making clothing. The needles found in the box were plied by strong, if not supple fingers, and what was sewed, was sewed strongly. Thread was plenty, as Smith had thought of using again that with which the strips of the balloon had been fastened together. These long bands had been carefully unripped by Spilett and Herbert with commendable patience, since Pencroff had thrown aside the work, which bothered him beyond measure; but when it came to sewing again the sailor was unequalled.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The varnish was then removed from the cloth by means of soda procured as before, and the cloth was afterwards bleached in the sun. Some dozens of shirts and socks—the latter, of course, not knitted, but made of sewed strips—were thus made. How happy it made the colonists to be clothed again in white linen—linen coarse enough, it is true, but they did not mind that—and to lie between sheets, which transformed the banks of Granite House into real beds! About this time they also made boots from seal leather, which were a timely substitute for those brought from America. They were long and wide enough, and never pinched the feet of the pedestrians.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the beginning of the year (1866) the hot weather was incessant, but the hunting in the woods, which fairly swarmed with birds and beasts, continued; and Spilett and Herbert were too good shots to waste powder. Smith had recommended them to save their ammunition, and that they might keep it for future use the engineer took measures to replace it by substances easily renewable. How could he tell what the future might have in store for them in case they left the island? It behooved them, therefore, to prepare for all emergencies.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As Smith had not discovered any lead in the island he substituted iron shot, which were easily made. As they were not so heavy as leaden ones they had to be made larger, and the charges contained a less number, but the skill of the hunters counterbalanced this defect. Powder he could have made, since he had all the necessary materials but as its preparation requires extreme care, and as without special apparatus it is difficult to make it of good quality, Smith proposed to manufacture pyroxyline, a kind of gun-cotton, a substance in which cotton is not necessary, except as cellulose. Now cellulose is simply the elementary tissue of vegetables, and is found in almost a pure state not only in cotton, but also in the texile fibres of hemp and flax, in paper and old rags, the pith of the elder, etc. And it happened that elder trees abounded in the island towards the mouth of Red Creek:—the colonists had already used its shoots and berries in place of coffee.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Thus they had the cellulose at hand, and the only other substance necessary for the manufacture of pyroxyline was nitric acid, which Smith could easily produce as before. The engineer, therefore, resolved to make and use this combustible, although he was aware that it had certain serious inconveniences, such as inflaming at 170° instead of 240°, and a too instantaneous deflagration for firearms. On the other hand, pyroxyline had these advantages—it was not affected by dampness, it did not foul the gun-barrels, and its explosive force was four times greater than that of gunpowder.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In order to make the pyroxyline, Smith made a mixture of three parts of nitric acid with five of concentrated sulphuric acid, and steeped the cellulose in this mixture for a quarter of an hour; afterwards it was washed in fresh water and left to dry. The operation succeeded perfectly, and the hunters had at their disposal a substance perfectly prepared, and which, used with discretion, gave excellent results.</p>
<p class="calibre3">About this time the colonists cleared three acres of Prospect Plateau, leaving the rest as pasture for the onagers. Many excursions were made into Jacamar Wood and the Far West, and they brought back a perfect harvest of wild vegetables, spinach, cresses, charlocks, and radishes, which intelligent culture would greatly change, and which would serve to modify the flesh diet which the colonists had been obliged to put up with. They also hauled large quantities of wood and coal, and each excursion helped improve the roads by grinding down its inequalities under the wheels.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The warren always furnished its contingent of rabbits, and as it was situated without Glycerine creek, its occupants could not reach nor damage the new plantations. As to the oyster-bed among the coast rocks, it furnished a daily supply of excellent mollusks. Further, fish from the lake and river were abundant, as Pencroff had made set-lines on which they often caught trout and another very savory fish marked with small yellow spots on a silver-colored body. Thus Neb, who had charge of the culinary department, was able to make an agreeable change in the menu of each repast. Bread alone was wanting at the colonists’ table, and they felt this privation exceedingly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Sometimes the little party hunted the sea-turtles, which frequented the coast at Mandible Cape. At this season the beach was covered with little mounds enclosing the round eggs, which were left to the sun to hatch; and as each turtle produces two hundred and fifty eggs annually, their number was very great.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is a true egg-field,” said Spilett, “and all we have to do is to gather them.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">But they did not content themselves with these products; they hunted also the producers, and took back to Granite House a dozen of these reptiles, which were excellent eating. Turtle soup, seasoned with herbs, and a handful of shell-fish thrown in, gained high praise for its concoctor, Neb.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Another fortunate event, which permitted them to make new provision for winter, must be mentioned. Shoals of salmon ascended the Mercy for many miles, in order to spawn. The river was full of these fish, which measured upwards of two feet in length, and it was only necessary to place some barriers in the stream in order to capture a great many. Hundreds were caught in this way, and salted down for winter, when the ice would stop the fishing.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Jup, during this time, was elevated to the position of a domestic. He had been clothed in a jacket, and short trowsers, and an apron with pockets, which were his joy, as he kept his hands in them and allowed no one to search them. The adroit orang had been wonderfully trained by Neb, and one would have said they understood each other’s conversation. Jup had, moreover, a real affection for the Negro, which was reciprocated. When the monkey was not wanted to carry wood or to climb to the top of some tree, he was passing his time in the kitchen, seeking to imitate Neb in all that he was doing. The master also showed great patience and zeal in instructing his pupil, and the pupil showed remarkable intelligence in profiting by these lessons.</p>
