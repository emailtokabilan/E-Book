<p class="calibre3">The colonists were familiar with all the eastern coast of the island between Claw Cape and the Mandibles; with Tadorn’s Fens; the neighborhood of Lake Grant; the portion of Jacamar Wood lying between the road to the corral and the Mercy; the courses of the Mercy and Red Creek, and those spurs of Mount Franklin where the corral was located.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They had partially explored the long sweep of Washington Bay from Claw Cape to Reptile End; the wooded and marshy shore of the west coast, and the interminable downs which extended to the half-open mouth of Shark Gulf.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But they were unacquainted with the vast woods of Serpentine Peninsula; all the right bank of the Mercy; the left bank of Fall River, and the confused mass of ravines and ridges which covered three-fourths of the base of Mount Franklin on the west, north, and east, and where, doubtless, there existed deep recesses. Therefore, many thousands of acres had not yet been explored.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was decided that the expedition should cross the Forest of the Far West, in such a manner as to go over all that part situated on the right of the Mercy. Perhaps it would have been better to have gone at once to the corral, where it was probable the convicts had either pillaged the place or installed themselves there. But either the pillage was a work accomplished or the convicts had purposed to entrench themselves there, and it would always be time to dislodge them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So the first plan was decided upon, and it was resolved to cut a road through these woods, placing Granite House in communication with the end of the peninsula, a distance of sixteen or seventeen miles.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The wagon was in perfect order. The onagers, well rested, were in excellent condition for a long pull. Victuals, camp utensils, and the portable stove, were loaded into the wagon, together with a careful selection of arms and ammunition.</p>
<p class="calibre3">No one was left in Granite House; even Top and Jup took part in the expedition. The inaccessible dwelling could take care of itself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Sunday, the day before the departure, was observed as a day of rest and prayer, and on the morning of the 15th Smith took the measures necessary to defend Granite House from invasion. The ladders were carried to the Chimneys and buried there, the basket of the elevator was removed, and nothing left of the apparatus. Pencroff, who remained behind in Granite House, saw to this latter, and then slid down to the ground by means of a double cord which, dropped to the ground, severed the last connection between the entrance and the shore.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The weather was superb.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is going to be a warm day,” said the reporter, joyfully.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But, Doctor Spilett,” said Pencroff, “our road is under the trees, and we will never see the sun!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Forward!” said the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The wagon was ready on the bank. The reporter insisted on Herbert taking a seat in it, at least for the first few hours. Neb walked by the onagers. Smith, the reporter, and the sailor went on ahead. Top bounded off into the grass; Jup took a seat beside Herbert, and the little party started.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The wagon went up the left bank of the Mercy, across the bridge, and there, leaving the route to Balloon Harbor to the left, the explorers began to make a way through the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre3">For the first two miles, the trees grew sufficiently apart to permit the wagon to proceed easily, without any other obstacle than here and there a stump or some bushes to arrest their progress. The thick foliage made a cool shadow over the ground. Birds and beasts were plenty, and reminded the colonists of their early excursions on the island.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Nevertheless,” remarked Smith, “I notice that the animals are more timid than formerly. These woods have been recently traversed by the convicts, and we shall certainly find their traces.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">And, indeed, in many places, they saw where a party of men had passed, or built a fire, but in no one place was there a definite camp.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The engineer had charged his companions to abstain from hunting, so as not to make the convicts aware of their presence by the sound of firearms.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the afternoon, some six miles from Granite House, the advance became very difficult, and they had to pass certain thickets, into which Top and Jup were sent as skirmishers.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The halt for the night was made, nine miles from Granite House, on the bank of a small affluent to the Mercy, of whose existence they had been unaware. They had good appetites, and all made a hearty supper, after which the camp was carefully organized, in order to guard against a surprise from the convicts. Two of the colonists kept guard together in watches of two hours, but Herbert, in spite of his wishes, was not allowed to do duty.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The night passed without incident. The silence was unbroken save by the growling of jaguars and the chattering of monkeys, which seemed particularly to annoy Jup.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The next day, they were unable to accomplish more than six miles. Like true “frontiersmen,” the colonists avoided the large trees and cut down only the smaller ones, so that their road was a winding one.</p>
<p class="calibre3">During the day Herbert discovered some specimens of the tree ferns, with vase-shaped leaves, and the algarobabeau (St. John’s bread), which the onagers eat greedily. Splendid kauris, disposed in groups, rose to a height of two hundred feet, their cylindrical trunks surmounted by a crown of verdure.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As to fauna, they discovered no new specimens, but they saw, without being able to approach them, a couple of large birds, such as are common in Australia, a sort of cassowary, called emus, which were five feet high, of brown plumage, and belonged to the order of runners. Top tried his best to catch them, but they outran him easily, so great was their speed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists again found traces of the convicts. Near a recently-extinguished fire they found footprints, which they examined with great attention. By measuring these tracks they were able to determine the presence of five men. The five convicts had evidently camped here; but—and they made minute search—they could not discover a sixth track, which would have been that of Ayrton.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ayrton is not with them!” said Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No,” replied Pencroff, “the wretches have shot him.” But they must have a den, to which we can track them.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No,” replied the reporter. “It is more likely that they intend to camp about in places, after this manner, until they become masters of the island.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Masters of the island!” cried the sailor. “Masters of the island, indeed” he repeated in a horrified voice. Then he added:——</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The ball in my gun is the one which wounded Herbert and it will do its errand!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">But this just reprisal would not restore Ayrton to life, and the only conclusion to be drawn, from the footprints was that they would never see him again!</p>
<p class="calibre3">That evening the camp was made fourteen miles front Granite House, and Smith estimated that it was still five miles to Reptile End.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The next day this point was reached, and the full length of the forest had been traversed; but nothing indicated the retreat of the convicts, nor the asylum of the mysterious unknown.</p>
<p class="calibre3"><a id="LIV"></a></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00069" class="calibre2">CHAPTER LIV.</h4>
<p class="calibre3">EXPLORATION OF REPTILE END—CAMP AT THE MOUTH OF FALL RIVER—BY THE CORRAL—THE RECONNOISSANCE—THE RETURN—FORWARD—AN OPEN DOOR—A LIGHT IN THE WINDOW—BY MOONLIGHT.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The next day, the 18th, was devoted to an exploration of the wooded shore lying between Reptile End and Fall River. The colonists were searching through the heart of the forest, whose width, bounded by the shores of the promontory, was from three to four miles. The trees, by their size and foliage, bore witness to the richness of the soil, more productive here than in any other portion of the island. It seemed as if a portion of the virgin forests of America or Central Africa had been transported here. It seemed, also, as if these superb trees found beneath the soil, moist on its surface, but heated below by volcanic fires, a warmth not belonging to a temperate climate. The principal trees, both in number and size, were the kauris and eucalypti.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But the object of the colonists was not to admire these magnificent vegetables. They knew already that, in this respect, their island merited a first place in the Canaries, called, formerly, the Fortunate Isles. But, alas! their island no longer belonged to them alone; others had taken possession, wretches whom it was necessary to destroy to the last man.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the west coast they found no further traces of any kind.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“This does not astonish me,” said Smith. “The convicts landed near Jetsam Point, and, after having crossed Tadorn’s Fens, they buried themselves in the forests of the Far West. They took nearly the same route which we have followed. That explains the traces we have seen in the woods. Arrived upon the shore, the convicts saw very clearly that it offered no convenient shelter, and it was then, on going towards the north, that they discovered the corral—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Where they may have returned,” said Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I do not think so,” answered the engineer, “as they would judge that our searches would be in that direction. The corral is only a provisional and not a permanent retreat for them.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I think so, too,” said the reporter, “and, further, that they have sought a hiding place among the spurs of Mount Franklin.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then let us push on to the corral!” cried Pencroff. “An end must be put to this thing, and we are only losing time here.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, my friend,” replied the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You forget that we are interested in determining whether the forests of the Far West do not shelter some habitation. Our exploration has a double end, Pencroff; to punish crime and to make a discovery.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That is all very well, sir,” replied the sailor, “but I have an idea that we will not discover our friend unless he chooses!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff had expressed the opinion of the others as well as his own. It was, indeed, probable that the retreat of the unknown being was no less mysterious than his personality.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This evening the wagon halted at the mouth of Fall River. The encampment was made in the usual way, with the customary precautions. Herbert had recovered his former strength by this march in the fresh salt air, and his place was no longer on the wagon, but at the head of the line.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the 19th, the colonists left the shore and followed up the left bank of Fall River. The route was already partially cleared, owing to the previous excursions made from the corral to the west coast. They reached a place six miles from Mount Franklin.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The engineer’s project was to observe with great care all the valley through which flowed the river, and to work cautiously up to the corral. If they should find it occupied, they were to secure it by main force, but if it should be empty, it was to be used as the point from which the explorations of Mount Franklin would be made.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The road was through a narrow valley, separating two of the most prominent spurs of Mount Franklin. The trees grew closely together on the banks of the river, but were more scattered on the upper slopes. The ground was very much broken, affording excellent opportunities for an ambush, so that it was necessary to advance with great caution. Top and Jup went ahead, exploring the thickets on either hand, but nothing indicated either the presence or nearness of the convicts, or that these banks had been recently visited.</p>
<p class="calibre3">About 5 o’clock the wagon halted 600 paces from the enclosure, hidden by a curtain of tall trees.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was necessary to reconnoitre the place, in order to find out whether it was occupied, but to do this in the day-time was to run the risk of being shot; nevertheless Spilett wanted to make the experiment at once, and Pencroff, out of all patience, wanted to go with him. But Smith would not permit it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, my friends,” said he, “wait until nightfall. I will not allow one of you to expose yourselves in the daylight.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But, sir,”—urged the sailor, but little disposed to obey.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Pray do not go, Pencroff,” said the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“All right,” said the sailor. But he gave vent to his anger by calling the convicts everything bad that he could think of.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists remained about the wagon, keeping a sharp lookout in the adjoining parts of the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Three hours passed in this manner. The wind fell, and absolute silence reigned over everything. The slightest sound—the snapping of a twig, a step on the dry leaves—could easily have been heard. But all was quiet. Top rested with his head between his paws, giving no sign of inquietude.</p>
<p class="calibre3">By 8 o’clock the evening was far enough advanced for the reconnoissance to be undertaken, and Spilett and Pencroff set off alone. Top and Jup remained behind with the others, as it was necessary that no bark or cry should give the alarm.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Do not do anything imprudently,” urged Smith. “Remember, you are not to take possession of the corral, but only to find out whether it is occupied or not.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“All right,” answered Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The two set out, advancing with the greatest caution. Under the trees, the darkness was such as to render objects, thirty or forty paces distant, invisible. Five minutes after having left the wagon they reached the edge of the opening, at the end of which rose the fence of the enclosure. Here they halted. Some little light still illuminated the glade. Thirty paces distant was the gate of the corral, which seemed to be closed. These thirty paces which it was necessary to cross constituted, to use a ballistic expression, the dangerous zone, as a shot from the palisade would certainly have killed any one venturing himself within this space,</p>
<p class="calibre3">Spilett and the sailor were not men to shirk danger, but they knew that any imprudence of theirs would injure their companions as well as themselves. If they were killed what would become of the others?</p>
<p class="calibre3">Nevertheless, Pencroff was so excited in finding himself again close to the corral that he would have hurried forward had not the strong hand of Spilett detained him. “In a few minutes it will be dark,” whispered the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff grasped his gun nervously, and waited unwillingly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Very soon the last rays of light disappeared. Mount Franklin loomed darkly against the western sky, and the night fell with the rapidity peculiar to these low latitudes. Now was the time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The reporter and Pencroff, ever since their arrival on the edge of the wood, had watched the corral. It seemed to be completely deserted. The upper edge of the palisade was in somewhat stronger relief than the surrounding shades, and nothing broke its outlines. Nevertheless, if the convicts were there, they must have posted one of their number as a guard.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Spilett took the hand of his companion, and crept cautiously forward to the gate of the corral. Pencroff tried to push it open, but it was, as they had supposed, fastened. But the sailor discovered that the outer bars were not in place. They, therefore, concluded that the convicts were within, and had fastened the gate so that it could only be broken open.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They listened. No sound broke the silence. The animals were doubtless sleeping in their sheds. Should they scale the fence? It was contrary to Smith’s instructions. They might be successful or they might fail. And, if there was now a chance of surprising the convicts, should they risk that chance in this way?</p>
<p class="calibre3">The reporter thought not. He decided that it would be better to wait until they were all together before making the attempt. Two things were certain, that they could reach the fence unseen, and that the place seemed unguarded.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff, probably, agreed to this, for he returned with the reporter to the wood, and a few minutes later Smith was informed of the situation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well,” said he after reflecting for a moment, “I don’t think that the convicts are here.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We will find out when we have climbed in.” cried Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“To the corral, my friends.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Shall we leave the wagon in the wood?” cried Neb.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No,” said Smith, “it may serve as a defense in case of need.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The wagon issued from the wood and rolled noiselessly over the ground. The darkness and the silence were profound. The colonists kept their guns in readiness to fire. Jup kept behind, at Pencroff’s order, and Neb held Top.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Soon the dangerous zone was crossed, and the wagon was drawn up beside the fence. Neb stood at the head of the onagers to keep them quiet, and the others went to the gate to determine if it was barricaded on the inside.</p>
<p class="calibre3">One of its doors was open!</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What did you tell us?” exclaimed the engineer, turning to the sailor and Spilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They were stupefied with amazement.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Upon my soul,” cried the sailor, “It was shut a minute ago!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists hesitated. The convicts must have been in the corral when Pencroff and the reporter had made their reconnoissance; for the gate could only have been opened by them. Were they still there?</p>
<p class="calibre3">At this moment, Herbert, who had ventured some steps within the inclosure, rushed back and seized Smith’s hand.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What have you seen?” asked the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“A light!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“In the house?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">All went forward and saw a feeble ray of light trembling through the windows of the building.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith determined what to do at once.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is a fortunate chance, finding the convicts shut up in this house not expecting anything! They are ours! Come on!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The wagon was left under charge of Top and Jup, and the colonists glided into the enclosure. In a few moments they were before the closed door of the house.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith, making a sign to his companions not to move, approached the window. He looked into the one room which formed the lower story of the building. On the table was a lighted lantern, Near by was Ayrton’s bed. On it was the body of a man.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Suddenly, Smith uttered a stiffled exclamation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ayrton!” he cried.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And, at once, the door was rather forced than opened, and all rushed into the chamber.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ayrton seemed to be sleeping. His face showed marks of long and cruel suffering. His wrists and ankles were much bruised.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith leaned over him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ayrton!” cried the engineer, seizing in his arms this man found so unexpectedly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ayrton opened his eyes, and looked first at Smith, then at the others.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You! Is it you?” he cried.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ayrton! Ayrton!” repeated the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Where am I?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“In the corral.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Am I alone?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then they will come here!” cried Ayrton. “Look out for yourselves! Defend yourselves!” and he fell back, fainting.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Spilett,” said the engineer, “We may be attacked at any minute. Bring the wagon inside the enclosure, and bar the gate, and then come back here.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff, Neb, and the reporter hastened to execute the orders of the engineer. There was not an instant to be lost. Perhaps the wagon was already in the hands of the convicts!</p>
<p class="calibre3">In a moment the reporter and his companions had gained the gate of the enclosure, behind which they heard Top growling.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The engineer, leaving Ayrton for a moment, left the house, and held his gun in readiness to fire. Herbert was beside him. Both scrutinized the outline of the mountain spur overlooking the corral. If the convicts were hidden in that place they could pick off the colonists one after the other.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Just then the moon appeared in the east above the black curtain of the forest, throwing a flood of light over the interior of the corral, and bringing into relief the trees, the little water-course, and the grassy carpet. Towards the mountain, the house and a part of the palisade shone white; opposite it, towards the gate, the fence was in shadow.</p>
<p class="calibre3">A black mass soon showed itself. It was the wagon entering within the circle of light, and Smith could hear the sound of the gate closing and being solidly barricaded by his companions.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But at that moment Top, by a violent effort, broke his fastening, and, barking furiously, rushed to the extremity of the corral to the right of the house.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Look out, my friends, be ready!” cried Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists waited, with their guns at the shoulder. Top continued to bark, and Jup, running towards the dog, uttered sharp cries.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists, following him, came to the border of the little brook, overshadowed by large trees.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And there, in the full moonlight, what did they see?</p>
<p class="calibre3">Five corpses lay extended upon the bank!</p>
<p class="calibre3">They were the bodies of the convicts, who, four months before, had landed upon Lincoln Island.</p>
<p class="calibre3"><a id="LV"></a></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00070" class="calibre2">CHAPTER LV.</h4>
<p class="calibre3">AYRTON’S RECITAL—PLANS OF HIS OLD COMRADES—TAKING POSSESSION OF THE CORRAL—THE RULES OF THE ISLAND—THE GOOD LUCK—RESEARCHES ABOUT MOUNT FRANKLIN—THE UPPER VALLEYS —SUBTERRANEAN RUMBLINGS—PENCROFF’S ANSWER—AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER-THE RETURN</p>
<p class="calibre3">How had it happened? Who had killed the convicts? Ayrton? No, since the moment before he had feared their return!</p>
<p class="calibre3">But Ayrton was now in a slumber from which it was impossible to arouse him. After he had spoken these few words, he had fallen back upon his bed, seized by a sudden torpor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists, terribly excited, preyed upon by a thousand confused thoughts, remained all night in the house. The next morning Ayrton awoke from his sleep, and his companions demonstrated to him their joy at finding him safe and sound after all these months of separation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then Ayrton related in a few words all that had happened.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The day after his return to the corral, the 10th of November, just at nightfall, he had been surprised by the convicts, who had climbed over the fence. He was tied and gagged and taken to a dark cavern at the foot of Mount Franklin, where the convicts had a retreat.</p>
<p class="calibre3">His death had been resolved upon, and he was to be killed the following day, when one of the convicts recognized him and called him by the name he had borne in Australia. These wretches, who would have massacred Ayrton, respected Ben Joyce.</p>
<p class="calibre3">From this moment Ayrton was subjected to the importunities of his old comrades. They wished to gain him over to them, and they counted upon him to take Granite House, to enter that inaccessible dwelling, and to become masters of the island, after having killed the colonists.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ayrton resisted. The former convict, repentant and pardoned, would rather die than betray his companions.</p>
<p class="calibre3">For four months, fastened, gagged, watched, he had remained in this cavern.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Meanwhile the convicts lived upon the stock in the corral, but did not inhabit the place.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the 11th of November, two of these bandits, inopportunely surprised by the arrival of the colonists, fired on Herbert, and one of them returned boasting of having killed one of the inhabitants. His companion, as we know, had fallen at Smith’s hand.</p>
<p class="calibre3">One can judge of Ayrton’s despair, when he heard of Herbert’s death! It left but four of the colonists, almost at the mercy of the convicts!</p>
<p class="calibre3">Following this event, and during all the time that the colonists, detained by Herbert’s illness, remained at the corral, the pirates did not leave their cave; indeed, after having pillaged Prospect Plateau, they did not deem it prudent to leave it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The bad treatment of Ayrton was redoubled. His hands and feet still bore the red marks of the lines with which he remained bound, day and night. Each moment he expected to be killed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This was the third week in February. The convicts, awaiting a favorable opportunity, rarely left their retreat, and then only to a point in the interior or on the west coast. Ayrton had no news of his friends, and no hopes of seeing them again.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Finally, the poor unfortunate, enfeebled by bad treatment, fell in a profound prostration in which he neither saw nor heard anything. From this moment, he could not say what had happened.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But, Mr. Smith,” he added, “since I was imprisoned in this cavern, how is it that I am here?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“How is that the convicts are lying there, dead, in the middle of the corral?” answered the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Dead!” cried Ayrton, half rising, notwithstanding his feebleness. His companions assisted him to get up, and all went to the little brook.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was broad daylight. There on the shore, in the position in which they had met their deaths, lay the five convicts.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ayrton was astounded. The others looked on without speaking. Then, at a sign from Smith, Neb and Pencroff examined the bodies. Not a wound was visible upon them. Only after minute search, Pencroff perceived on the forehead of one, on the breast of another, on this one’s back, and on the shoulder of a fourth, a small red mark, a hardly visible bruise, made by some unknown instrument.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“There is where they have been hit!” said Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But with what sort of a weapon?” cried the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“A destructive weapon enough, though unknown to us!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And who has destroyed them?” asked Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The ruler of the island,” answered Smith, “he who has brought you here, Ayrton, whose influence is again manifesting itself, who does for us what we are unable to do for ourselves, and who then hides from us.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let us search for him!” cried Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, we will search,” replied Smith; “but the being who accomplishes such prodigies will not be found until it pleases him to call us to him!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">This invisible protection, which nullified their own actions, both annoyed and affected the engineer. The relative inferiority in which it placed him wounded his pride. A generosity which so studiously eluded all mark of recognition denoted a sort of disdain for those benefited, which, in a measure, detracted from the value of the gift.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let us search,” he repeated, “and Heaven grant that some day we be permitted to prove to this haughty protector that he is not dealing with ingrates! What would I not give to be able, in our turn, to repay him, and to render him, even at the risk of our lives, some signal service!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">From this time, this search was the single endeavor of the inhabitants of Lincoln Island. All tried to discover the answer to this enigma, an answer which involved the name of a man endowed with an inexplicable, an almost superhuman power.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In a short time, the colonists entered the house again, and their efforts soon restored Ayrton to himself. Neb and Pencroff carried away the bodies of the convicts and buried them in the wood. Then, Ayrton was informed by the engineer of all that had happened during his imprisonment.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And now,” said Smith, finishing his recital, “we have one thing more to do. Half of our task is accomplished; but if the convicts are no longer to be feared, we did not restore ourselves to the mastership of the island!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Very well,” replied Spilett, “let us search all the mazes of Mount Franklin. Let us leave no cavity, no hole unexplored! Ah! if ever a reporter found himself in the presence of an exciting mystery. I am in that position!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And we will not return to Granite House,” said Herbert, “until we have found our benefactor.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes,” said Smith, “we will do everything that is possible for human beings to do—but, I repeat it, we will not find him till he wills it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Shall we stay here at the corral?” asked Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes,” replied the engineer, “let us remain here. Provisions are abundant, and we are in the centre of our circle of investigation, and, moreover, if it is necessary, the wagon can go quickly to Granite House.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“All right,” said Pencroff. “Only one thing.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What is that?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why, the fine weather is here, and we must not forget that we have a voyage to make.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“A voyage?” asked Spilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, to Tabor Island. We most put up a notice, indicating our island, in case the Scotch yacht returns. Who knows that it is not already too late?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But, Pencroff,” asked Ayrton, “how do you propose to make this voyage?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why, on the Good Luck!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The Good Luck!” cried Ayrton. “It’s gone!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Gone!” shouted Pencroff, springing to his feet.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes. The convicts discovered where the sloop lay, and, a week ago, they put out to sea in her, and—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And?” said Pencroff, his heart trembling.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And, not having Harvey to manage her, they ran her upon the rocks, and she broke all to pieces!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Oh! the wretches! the pirates! the devils!” exclaimed the sailor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Pencroff,” said Herbert, taking his hand, “we will build another, a larger Good Luck. We have all the iron, all the rigging of the brig at our disposal!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But, do you realize,” answered Pencroff, “that it will take at least five or six months to build a vessel of thirty or forty tons.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We will take our time,” replied the reporter, “and we will give up our voyage to Tabor Island for this year.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We must make the best of it, Pencroff,” said the engineer, “and I hope that this delay will not be prejudicial to us.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“My poor Good Luck! my poor boat!” exclaimed the sailor, half broken-hearted at the loss of what was so dear to him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The destruction of the sloop was a thing much to be regretted, and it was agreed that this loss must be repaired as soon as the search was ended.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This search was begun the same day, the 19th of February, and lasted throughout the week. The base of the mountain was composed of a perfect labyrinth of ravines and gorges, and it was here that the explorations must be made. No other part of the island was so well suited to hide an inhabitant who wished to remain concealed. But so great was the intricacy of these places that Smith explored them by a settled system.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the first place, the colonists visited the valley opening to the south of the volcano, in which Fall River rose. Here was where Ayrton showed them the cavern of the convicts. This place was in exactly the same condition as Ayrton had left it. They found here a quantity of food and ammunition left there as a reserve by the convicts.</p>
<p class="calibre3">All this beautiful wooded valley was explored with great care, and then, the south-western spur having been turned, the colonists searched a narrow gorge where the trees were less numerous. Here the stones took the place of grass, and the wild goats and moufflons bounded among the rocks. The arid part of the island began at this part. They saw already that, of the numerous valleys ramifying from the base of Mount Franklin, three only, bounded on the west by Fall River and on the east by Red Creek, were as rich and fertile as the valley of the corral. These two brooks, which developed into rivers as they progressed, received the whole of the mountain’s southern water-shed and fertilized that portion of it. As to the Mercy it was more directly fed by abundant springs, hidden in Jacamar Wood.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now any one of these three valleys would have answered for the retreat of some recluse, who would have found there all the necessaries of life. But the colonists had explored each of them without detecting the presence of man. Was it then at the bottom of these arid gorges, in the midst of heaps of rocks, in the rugged ravines to the north, between the streams of lava, that they would find this retreat and its occupant?</p>
<p class="calibre3">The northern part of Mount Franklin had at its base two large, arid valleys strewn with lava, sown with huge rocks, sprinkled with pieces of obsidian and labradorite. This part required long and difficult exploration. Here were a thousand cavities, not very comfortable, perhaps, but completely hidden and difficult of access. The colonists visited sombre tunnels, made in the plutonic epoch, still blackened by the fires of other days, which plunged into the heart of the mountain. They searched these dark galleries by the light of torches, peering into their least excavations and sounding their lowest depths. But everywhere was silence, obscurity. It did not seem as if any human being had ever trodden these antique corridors or an arm displaced one of these stones.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Nevertheless, if these places were absolutely deserted, if the obscurity was complete, Smith was forced to notice that absolute silence did not reign there.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Having arrived at the bottom of one of those sombre cavities, which extended several hundred feet into the interior of the mountain, he was surprised to hear deep muttering sounds which were intensified by the sonority of the rocks.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Spilett, who was with him, also heard these distant murmurs, which indicated an awakening of the subterranean fires.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Several times they listened, and they came to the conclusion that some chemical reaction was going on in the bowels of the earth.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The volcano is not entirely extinct,” said the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is possible that, since our exploration of the crater, something has happened in its lower regions. All volcanoes, even those which are said to be extinct, can, evidently, become active again.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But if Mount Franklin is preparing for another eruption, is not Lincoln Island in danger?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I don’t think so,” answered the engineer, “The crater, that is to say, the safety-valve, exists, and the overflow of vapors and lavas will escape, as heretofore, by its accustomed outlet.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Unless the lavas make a new passage towards the fertile parts of the island.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why, my dear Spilett, should they not follow their natural course?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, volcanoes are capricious.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Notice,” said Smith, “that all the slope of the mountain favors the flow of eruptive matter towards the valleys which we are traversing at present. It would take an earthquake to so change the centre of gravity of the mountain as to modify this slope.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But an earthquake is always possible under these conditions.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“True,” replied the engineer, “especially when the subterranean forces are awakening, and the bowels of the earth, after a long repose, chance to be obstructed. You are right, my dear Spilett, an eruption would be a serious thing for us, and it would be better if this volcano has not the desire to wake up; but we can do nothing. Nevertheless, in any case, I do not think Prospect Plateau could be seriously menaced. Between it and the lake there is quite a depression in the land, and even if the lavas took the road to the lake, they would be distributed over the downs and the parts adjoining Shark Gulf.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We have not yet seen any smoke from the summit, indicating a near eruption,” said Spilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No,” answered the engineer, “not the least vapor has escaped from the crater. It was but yesterday that I observed its upper part. But it is possible that rocks, cinders, and hardened lavas have accumulated in the lower part of its chimney, and, for the moment, this safety-valve is overloaded. But, at the first serious effort, all obstacles will disappear, and you may be sure, my dear Spilett, that neither the island, which is the boiler, nor the volcano, which is the valve, will burst under the pressure. Nevertheless, I repeat, it is better to wish for no eruption.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And yet we are not mistaken,” replied the reporter. “We plainly hear ominous rumblings in the depths of the volcano!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No,” replied the engineer, after listening again with the utmost attention, “that is not to be mistaken. Something is going on there the importance of which cannot be estimated nor what the result will be.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith and Spilett, on rejoining their companions, told them of these things.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“All right!” cried Pencroff. “This volcano wants to take care of us! But let it try! It will find its master!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Who’s that?” asked the negro.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Our genius, Neb, our good genius, who will put a gag in the mouth of the crater if it attempts to open it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The confidence of the sailor in the guardian of the island was absolute, and, indeed, the occult power which had so far been manifested seemed limitless; but, thus far this being had escaped all the efforts the colonists had made to discover him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">From the 19th to the 25th of February, the investigations were conducted in the western portion of Lincoln Island, where the most secret recesses were searched. They even sounded each rocky wall, as one knocks against the walls of a suspected house. The engineer went so far as to take the exact measure of the mountain, and he pushed his search to the last strata sustaining it. It was explored to the summit of the truncated cone which rose above the first rocky level, and from there to the upper edge of the enormous cap at the bottom of which opened the crater.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They did more; they visited the gulf, still extinct, but in whose depths the rumblings were distinctly heard. Nevertheless, not a smoke, not a vapor, no heat in the wall, indicated a near eruption. But neither there, nor in any other part of Mount Franklin, did the colonists find the traces of him whom they sought.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Their investigations were then directed over all the tract of downs. They carefully examined the high lava walls of Shark Gulf from base to summit, although it was very difficult to reach the water level. No one! Nothing!</p>
<p class="calibre3">These two words summed up in brief the result of all the useless fatigues Smith and his companions had been at, and they were a trifle annoyed at their ill success.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But it was necessary now to think of returning, as these researches could not be pursued indefinitely. The colonists were convinced that this mysterious being did not reside upon the surface of the island, and strange thoughts floated through their over-excited imaginations; Neb and Pencroff, particularly, went beyond the strange into the region of the supernatural. The 25th of February, the colonists returned to Granite House, and by means of the double cord, shot by an arrow to the door-landing, communication was established with their domain.</p>
<p class="calibre3">One month later, they celebrated the third anniversary of their arrival on Lincoln Island.</p>
<p class="calibre3"><a id="LVI"></a></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00071" class="calibre2">CHAPTER LVI.</h4>
<p class="calibre3">AFTER THREE YEARS—THE QUESTION OF A NEW SHIP—ITS DETERMINATION—PROSPERITY OF THE COLONY—THE SHIPYARD—THE COLD WEATHER—PENCROFF RESIGNED—WASHING—MOUNT FRANKLIN.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Three years had passed since the prisoners had fled from Richmond, and in all that time their conversation and their thoughts had been of the fatherland.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They had no doubt that the war was ended, and that the North had triumphed. But how? At what cost? What friends had fallen in the struggle? They often talked of these things, although they had no knowledge when they would be able to see that country again. To return, if only for a few days; to renew their intercourse with civilization; to establish a communication between their island and the mother country, and then to spend the greater part of their lives in this colony which they had founded and which would then be raised to a metropolis, was this a dream which could not be realized?</p>
<p class="calibre3">There were but two ways of realizing it: either a ship would some day show itself in the neighborhood of Lincoln Island, or the colonists must themselves build a vessel staunch enough to carry them to the nearest land.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Unless our genius furnishes us with the means of returning home,” said Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And, indeed, if Neb and Pencroff had been told that a 300-ton ship was waiting for them in Shark Gulf or Balloon Harbor, they would not have manifested any surprise. In their present condition they expected every thing.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But Smith, less confident, urged them to keep to realities, and to build the vessel, whose need was urgent, since a paper should be placed on Tabor Island as soon as possible, in order to indicate the new abode of Ayrton.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The Good Luck was gone. It would take at least six mouths to build another vessel, and, as winter was approaching, the voyage could not be made before the next spring.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We have time to prepare ourself for the fine weather,” said the engineer, talking of these things with Pencroff. “I think, therefore, since we have to build our own ship, it will be better to make her dimensions greater than before. The arrival of the</p>
<p class="calibre3">Scotch yacht is uncertain. It may even have happened that it has come and gone. What do you think? Would it not be better to build a vessel, that, in case of need, could carry us to the archipelagoes or New Zealand?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I think, sir, that you are as able to build a large vessel as a small one. Neither wood nor tools are wanting. It is only a question of time.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And how long would it take to build a ship of 250 or 300 tons?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Seven or eight months at least. But we must not forget that winter is at hand, and that the timber will be difficult to work during the severe cold. So, allowing for some weeks’ delay, you can be happy if you have your ship by next November.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Very well, that will be just the season to undertake a voyage of some length, be it to Tabor Island of further.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“All right, Mr. Smith, make your plans. The workmen are ready, and I guess that Ayrton will lend a helping hand.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The engineer’s project met the approval of the colonists, and indeed it was the best thing to do. It is true that it was a great undertaking, but they had that confidence in themselves, which is one of the elements of success.</p>
<p class="calibre3">While Smith was busy preparing the plans of the vessel, the others occupied themselves in felling the trees and preparing the timber. The forests of the Far West furnished the best oak and elm, which were carried over the new road through the forest to the Chimneys, where the ship-yard was established.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was important that the timber should be cut soon, as it was necessary to have it seasoning for some time. Therefore the workmen worked vigorously during April, which was not an inclement month, save for some violent wind storms. Jup helped them by his adroitness, either in climbing to the top of a tree to fasten a rope, or by carrying loads on his strong shoulders.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The timber was piled under a huge shed to await its use; and, meanwhile, the work in the fields was pushed forward, so that soon all traces of the devastation caused by the pirates had disappeared. The mill was rebuilt, and a new inclosure for the poultry yard. This had to be much larger than the former, as the number of its occupants had increased largely. The stables contained five onagas, four of them well broken, and one little colt. A plough had been added to the stock of the colony, and the onagas were employed in tillage as if they were Yorkshire or Kentucky cattle. All the colonists did their share, and there were no idle hands. And thus, with good health and spirits, they formed a thousand projects for the future.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ayrton, of course, partook of the common existence, and spoke no longer of returning to the corral. Nevertheless, he was always quiet and uncommunicative, and shared more in the work than the pleasure of his companions. He was a strong workman, vigorous, adroit, intelligent, and he could not fail to see that he was esteemed and loved by the others. But the corral was not abandoned. Every other day some one went there and brought back the supply of milk for the colony, and these occasions were also hunting excursions. So that, Herbert and Spilett, with Top in advance, oftenest made the journey, and all kinds of game abounded in the kitchen of Granite House. The products of the warren and the oyster-bed, some turtles, a haul of excellent salmon, the vegetables from the plateau, the natural fruits of the forest, were riches upon riches, and Neb, the chief cook, found it difficult to store them all away.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The telegraph had been repaired, and was used whenever one of the party remained over night at the corral. But the island was secure now from any aggression—at least from men.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Nevertheless, what had happened once might happen again, and a descent of pirates was always to be feared. And it was possible that accomplices of Harvey, still in Norfolk, might be privy to his projects and seek to imitate them. Every day the colonists searched the horizon visible from Granite House with the glass, and whenever they were at the corral they examined the west coast. Nothing appeared, but they were always on the alert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">One evening the engineer told his companions of a project to fortify the corral. It seemed prudent to heighten the palisade, and to flank it with a sort of block house, in which the colonists could defend themselves against a host of enemies. Granite House, owing to its position, was impregnable, and the corral would always be the objective point of pirates.</p>
<p class="calibre3">About the 15th of May the keel of the new vessel was laid, and the stem and stern posts raised. This keel was of oak, 110 feet long, and the breadth of beam was 25 feet. But, with the exception of putting up a couple of the frame pieces, this was all that could be done before the bad weather and the cold set in.</p>
<p class="calibre3">During the latter part of the month the weather was very inclement. Pencroff and Ayrton worked as long as they were able, but severely cold weather following the rain made the wood impossible to handle, and by the 10th of June the work was given up entirely, and the colonists were often obliged to keep in-doors.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This confinement was hard for all of them, but especially so for Spilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I’ll tell you what, Neb,” he said, “I will give you everything I own if you will get me a newspaper! All that I want to make me happy is to know what is going on in the world!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Neb laughed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Faith!” said he, “I am busy enough with my daily work.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">And, indeed, occupation was not wanting. The colony was at the summit of prosperity. The accident to the brig had been a new source of riches. Without counting a complete outfit of sails, which would answer for the new ship, utensils and tools of all sorts, ammunition, clothing, and instruments filled the store-rooms of Granite House. There was no longer a necessity to manufacture cloth in the felting mill. Linen, also, was plenty, and they took great care of it. From the chloride of sodium Smith had easily extracted soda and chlorine. The soda was easily transformed into carbonate of soda, and the chlorine was employed for various domestic purposes, but especially for cleaning the linen. Moreover, they made but four washings a year, as was the custom in old times, and Pencroff and Spilett, while waiting for the postman to bring the paper, made famous washermen!</p>
<p class="calibre3">Thus passed June, July, and August; very rigorous months, in which the thermometer measured but 8° Fahrenheit. But a good fire burned in the chimney of Granite House, and the superfluity of wood from the ship-yard enabled them to economize the coal, which required a longer carriage.</p>
<p class="calibre3">All, men and beasts, enjoyed good health. Jup, it is true, shivered a little with the cold, and they had to make him a good wadded wrapper. What servant he was! Adroit, zealous, indefatigable, not indiscreet, not talkative. He was, indeed, a model for his biped brethren in the New and the Old World!</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But, after all,” said Pencroff “when one has four hands, they cannot help doing their work well!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">During the seven months that had passed since the exploration of the mountain nothing had been seen or heard of the genius of the island. Although, it is true, that nothing had happened to the colonists requiring his assistance.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith noticed, too, that the growling of the dog and the anxiety of the orang had ceased during this time. These two friends no longer ran to the orifice of the well nor acted in that strange way which had attracted the attention of the engineer. But did this prove that everything had happened that was going to happen? That they were never to find an answer to the enigma? Could it be affirmed that no new conjunction of circumstances would make this mysterious personage appear again? Who knows what the future may bring forth?</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the 7th of September, Smith, looking towards Mount Franklin, saw a smoke rising and curling above the crater.</p>
<p class="calibre3"><a id="LVII"></a></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00072" class="calibre2">CHAPTER LVII.</h4>
<p class="calibre3">THE AWAKENING OF THE VOLCANO—THE FINE WEATHER—RESUMPTION OF WORK—THE EVENING OF THE 15TH OF OCTOBER—A TELEGRAPH—A DEMAND—AN ANSWER—DEPARTURE FOR THE CORRAL—THE NOTICE—THE EXTRA WIRE—THE BASALT WALL—AT HIGH TIDE—AT LOW TIDE—THE CAVERN—A DAZZLING LIGHT.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists, called by Smith, had left their work, and gazed in silence at the summit of Mount Franklin.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The volcano had certainly awakened, and its vapors had penetrated the mineral matter of the crater, but no one could say whether the subterranean fires would bring on a violent eruption.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But, even supposing an eruption, it was not likely that Lincoln Island would suffer in every part. The discharges of volcanic matter are not always disastrous. That the island had already been subjected to an eruption was evident from the currents of lava spread over the western slope of the mountain. Moreover, the shape of the crater was such as to vomit matter in the direction away from the fertile parts of the island.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Nevertheless, what had been was no proof of what would be. Often the old craters of volcanoes close and new ones open. An earthquake phenomenon, often accompanying volcanic action, may do this by changing the interior arrangement of the mountain and opening new passages for the incandescent lavas.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith explained these things to his companions, and without exaggerating the situation, showed them just what might happen.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After all, they could do nothing. Granite House did not seem to be menaced, unless by a severe earthquake. But all feared for the corral, if any new crater opened in the mountain.</p>
<p class="calibre3">From this time the vapor poured from the cone without cessation, and, indeed, increased in density and volume, although no flame penetrated its thick folds. The phenomenon was confined, as yet, to the lower part of the central chimney.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Meanwhile, with good weather, the work out of doors had been resumed. They hastened the construction of the ship, and Smith established a saw-mill at the waterfall, which cut the timber much more rapidly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Towards the end of September the frame of the ship, which was to be schooner-rigged, was so far completed that its shape could be recognized. The schooner, sheer forward and wide aft, was well adapted for a long voyage, in case of necessity, but the planking, lining, and decking still demanded a long time before they could be finished. Fortunately, the iron-work of the brig had been saved after the explosion, and Pencroff and Ayrton had obtained a great quantity of copper nails from the broken timber, which economized the labor for the smiths; nevertheless the carpenters had much to accomplish.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Often, however, after the day’s work was ended, the colonists sat late into the night, conversing together of the future and what might happen in a voyage in the schooner to the nearest land. But in discussing these projects they always planned to return to Lincoln Island. Never would they abandon this colony, established with so much difficulty, but so successfully, and which would receive a new development through communication with America.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff and Neb, indeed, hoped to end their days here.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Herbert,” asked the sailor, “you would never abandon Lincoln Island?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Never, Pencroff, especially if you made up your mind to remain.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then, it’s agreed, my boy. I shall expect you! You will bring your wife and children here, and I will make a jolly playmate for the babies!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Agreed,” answered Herbert, laughing and blushing at the same time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And you, Mr. Smith,” continued the sailor, enthusiastically, “you will always remain governor of the island! And, by the way, how many inhabitants can the island support? Ten thousand, at the very least!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">They chatted in this way, letting Pencroff indulge in his whims, and one thing leading to another, the reporter finished by founding the <i class="calibre5">New Lincoln Herald</i>!</p>
<p class="calibre3">Thus it is with the spirit of man. The need of doing something permanent, something which will survive him, is the sign of his superiority over everything here below. It is that which has established and justifies his domination over the whole world.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After all, who knows if Jup and Top had not their dream of the future?</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ayrton, silent, said to himself that he wanted to see Lord Glenarvan, and show him the change in himself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">One evening, the 15th of October, the conversation was prolonged longer than usual. It was 9 o’clock, and already, long, ill-concealed yawns showed that it was bed-time. Pencroff was about starting in that direction, when, suddenly, the electric bell in the hall rang.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Every one was present, so none of their party could be at the corral.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith rose. His companions looked as if they had not heard aright.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What does he want?” cried Neb. “Is it the devil that’s ringing?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">No one replied.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is stormy weather,” said Herbert; “perhaps the electric influence——”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Herbert did not finish the sentence. The engineer, towards whom all were looking, shook his head.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Wait a minute,” said Spilett. “If it is a signal, it will be repeated.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But what do you think it is?” asked Neb.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Perhaps it——”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The sailor’s words were interrupted by another ring.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith went to the apparatus, and, turning on the current, telegraphed to the corral:——</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What do you want?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">A few minutes later the needle, moving over the lettered card, gave this answer to the inmates of Granite House:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Come to the corral as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“At last!” cried Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Yes! At last! The mystery was about to be solved! Before the strong interest in what was at the corral, all fatigue and need of repose vanished. Without saying a word, in a few minutes they were out of Granite House and following the shore. Only Top and Jup remained behind.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The night was dark. The moon, new this day, had set with the sun. Heavy clouds obscured the stars, but now and then heat-lightning, the reflection of a distant storm, illuminated the horizon.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But, great as the darkness was, it could not hinder persons as familiar with the route as were the colonists. All were very much excited, and walked rapidly. There could be no doubt that they were going to find the answer to the engineer, the name of that mysterious being, who was so generous in his influence, so powerful to accomplish! It could not be doubted that this unknown had been familiar with the least detail of their daily lives, that he overheard all that was said in Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Each one, lost in his reflections, hurried onward. The darkness under the trees was such that the route was invisible. There was no sound in the forest. Not a breath of wind moved the leaves.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This silence during the first quarter of an hour was uninterrupted, save by Pencroff, who said:——</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We should have brought a lantern.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">And by the engineer’s answer:——</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We will find one at the corral.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith and his companions had left Granite House at twelve minutes past 9. In thirty-five minutes they had traversed three of the five miles between the mouth of the Mercy and the corral.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Just then, brilliant flashes of lightning threw the foliage into strong relief. The storm was evidently about to burst upon them. The flashes became more frequent and intense. Heavy thunder rolled through the heavens. The air was stifling.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists rushed on, as if impelled by some irresistible force.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At a quarter past 9, a sudden flash showed them the outline of the palisade; and scarcely had they passed the gateway when there came a terrible clap of thunder. In a moment the corral was crossed, and Smith stood before the house. It was possible that the unknown being was here, since it was from this place that the telegraph had come. Nevertheless, there was no light in the window.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The engineer knocked at the door, but without response.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He opened it, and the colonists entered the room, which was in utter darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre3">A light was struck by Neb, and in a moment the lantern was lit, and its light directed into every corner of the chamber.</p>
<p class="calibre3">No one was there, and everything remained undisturbed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Are we victims to a delusion?” murmured Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">No! that was impossible! The telegraph had certainly said:——</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Come to the corral quickly as possible.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">He went to the table on which the apparatus was arranged. Everything was in place and in order.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Who was here last?” asked the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I, sir,” answered Ayrton.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And that was——”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Four days ago.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ah! here is something!” exclaimed Herbert, pointing to a paper lying on the table.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the paper were these words, written in English:——</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Follow the new wire.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Come on!” cried Smith, who comprehended in a moment that the dispatch had not been sent from the corral, but from the mysterious abode which the new wire united directly with Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Neb took the lantern and all left the corral.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then the storm broke forth with extreme violence. Flashes of lightning and peals of thunder followed in rapid succession. The island was the centre of the storm. By the flashes of lightning they could see the summit of Mount Franklin enshrouded in smoke.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There were no telegraph poles inside the corral, but the engineer, having passed the gate, ran to the nearest post, and saw there a new wire fastened to the insulator, and reaching to the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Here it is!” he cried.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The wire lay along the ground, and was covered with some insulating substance, like the submarine cables. By its direction it seemed as if it went towards the west, across the woods, and the southern spurs of the mountain.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let us follow it,” said Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And sometimes by the light of the lantern, sometimes by the illumination of the heavens, the colonists followed the way indicated by the thread.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They crossed in the first place, the spur of the mountain between the valley of the corral and that of Fall River, which stream was crossed in its narrowest part. The wire, sometimes hanging on the lower branches of the trees, sometimes trailing along the ground, was a sure guide.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The engineer had thought that, perhaps, the wire would end at the bottom of the valley, and that the unknown retreat was there.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But not so. It extended over the southwestern spur and descended to the arid plateau which ended that fantastic wall of basalt. Every now and then one or other of the party stooped and took the direction of the wire. There could be no doubt that it ran directly to the sea. There, doubtless, in some profound chasm in the igneous rocks, was the dwelling so vainly sought for until now.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At a few minutes before 10, the colonists arrived upon the high coast overhanging the ocean. Here the wire wound among the rocks, following a steep slope down a narrow ravine.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists followed it, at the risk of bringing down upon themselves a shower of rocks or of being precipitated into the sea. The descent was extremely perilous, but they thought not of the danger; they were attracted to this mysterious place as the needle is drawn to the magnet.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At length, the wire making a sudden turn, touched the shore rocks, which were beaten by the sea. The colonists had reached the base of the granite wall.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Here there was a narrow projection running parallel and horizontal to the sea. The thread led along this point, and the colonists followed. They had not proceeded more than a hundred paces, when this projection, by a south inclination, sloped down into the water.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The engineer seized the wire and saw that it led down into the sea.</p>
<p class="calibre3">His companions stood, stupefied, beside him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then a cry of disappointment, almost of despair, escaped them! Must they throw themselves into the water and search some submarine cavern? In their present state of excitement, they would not have hesitated to have done it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">An observation made by the engineer stopped them. He led his companions to the shelter of a pile of rocks and said:——</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let as wait here. The tide is up. At low water the road will be open.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But how do you think—” began Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“He would not have called us, unless the means of reaching him had been provided.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith had spoken with an air of conviction, and, moreover, his observation was logical. It was, indeed, quite possible that an opening existed at low water which was covered at present.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was necessary to wait some hours. The colonists rested in silence under their shelter. The rain began to fall in torrents. The echoes repeated the roaring of the thunder in sonorous reverberations.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At midnight the engineer took the lantern and went down to the water’s edge. It was still two hours before low tide.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith had not been mistaken. The entrance to a vast excavation began to be visible, and the wire, turning at a right angle, entered this yawning mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith returned to his companions and said:——</p>
<p class="calibre3">“In an hour the opening will be accessible.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then there is one,” said Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Do you doubt it?” replied Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But it will be half full of water,” said Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Either it will be perfectly dry,” answered the engineer, “in which case we will walk, or it will not be dry, and some means of transport will be furnished us.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">An hour passed. All went down through the rain to the sea. In these hours the tide had fallen fifteen feet. The top of the mouth of the opening rose eight feet above the water, like the arch of a bridge.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Looking in, the engineer saw a black object floating on the surface. He drew it toward him. It was a canoe made of sheet-iron bolted together. It was tied to a projecting rock inside the cavern wall. A pair of oars were under the seats.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Get in,” said Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists entered the boat, Neb and Ayrton took the oars, Pencroff the tiller, and Smith, in the bows holding the lantern, lit the way.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The vault, at first very low, rose suddenly; but the darkness was too great for them to recognize the size of this cavern, its heighth and depth. An imposing silence reigned throughout this granite chamber. No sound, not even the pealing of the thunder penetrated its massive walls.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In certain parts of the world there are immense caves, a sort of natural crypts which date back to the geologic epoch. Some are invaded by the sea; others contain large lakes within their walls. Such is Fingal’s Cave, in the Island of Staffa; such are the caves of Morgat on the Bay of Douarnenez in Brittany; the caves of Bonifacio, in Corsica; those of Lyse-Fjord, in Norway; such is that immense cavern, the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky, which is 500 feet high and more than twenty miles long!</p>
<p class="calibre3">As to this cavern which the colonists were exploring, did it not reach to the very centre of the island? For a quarter of an hour the canoe advanced under the directions of the engineer. At a certain moment he said:——</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Go over to the right.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The canoe, taking this direction, brought up beside the wall. The engineer wished to observe whether the wire continued along this side.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was there fastened to the rock.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Forward!” said Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The canoe kept on a quarter of an hour longer, and it must have been half a mile from the entrance, when Smith’s voice was heard again.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Halt!” he exclaimed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The canoe stopped, and the colonists saw a brilliant light illuminating the enormous crypt, so profoundly hidden in the bowels of the earth.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They were now enabled to examine this cavern of whose existence they had had no suspicion.</p>
<p class="calibre3">A vault, supported on basaltic shafts, which might all have been cast in the same mould, rose to a height of 100 feet. Fantastic arches sprung at irregular intervals from these columns, which Nature had placed here by thousands. They rose to a height of forty or fifty feet, and the water, in despite of the tumult without, quietly lapped their base. The light noticed by the engineer seized upon each prismatic point and tipped it with fire; penetrated, so to speak, the walls as if they had been diaphanous, and changed into sparkling jewels the least projections of the cavern.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Following a phenomenon of reflection, the water reproduced these different lights upon its surface, so that the canoe seemed to float between two sparkling zones.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They had not yet thought of the nature of irradiation projected by the luminous centre whose rays, straight and clear, were broken on all the angles and mouldings of the crypt. The white color of this light betrayed its origin. It was electric. It was the sun of this cavern.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On a sign from Smith, the oars fell again into the water, and the canoe proceeded towards the luminous fire, which was half a cable’s length distant.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In this place, the sheet of water measured some 300 feet across, and an enormous basaltic wall, closing all that side, was visible beyond the luminous centre. The cavern had become much enlarged, and the sea here formed a little lake. But the vault, the side walls, and those of the apsis, all the prisms, cylinders, cones, were bathed in the electric fluid.</p>
