<p class="calibre3">The canoe approached softly. In the bows stood Smith. He was greatly excited. Suddenly he seized the arm of the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is he! It can be no other than he.” he cried. “He!——”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then he fell back upon the seat murmuring a name which Spilett alone heard.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Doubtless the reporter knew this name, for it affected him strangely, and he answered in a hoarse voice:——</p>
<p class="calibre3">“He! a man outlawed!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The same!” said Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Under the engineer’s direction the canoe approached this singular floating machine, and came up to it on its left side, from which escaped a gleam of light through a thick glass.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith and his companions stepped on to the platform. An open hatchway was there, down which all descended.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At the bottom of the ladder appeared the waist of the vessel lit up by electric light. At the end of the waist was a door, which Smith pushed open.</p>
<p class="calibre3">A richly ornamented library, flooded with light, was rapidly crossed by the colonists. Beyond, a large door, also closed, was pushed open by the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">A vast saloon, a sort of museum, in which were arranged all the treasures of the mineral world, works of art, marvels of industry, appeared before the eyes of the colonists, who seemed to be transported to the land of dreams.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Extended upon a rich divan they saw a man, who seemed unaware of their presence.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then Smith raised his voice, and, to the extreme surprise of his companions, pronounced these words:——</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Captain Nemo, you have called us. Here we are.’</p>
<p class="calibre3"><a id="LVIII"></a></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00073" class="calibre2">CHAPTER LVIII.</h4>
<p class="calibre3">CAPTAIN NEMO—HIS FIRST WORDS—HISTORY OF A HERO OF LIBERTY—HATRED OF THE INVADERS—HIS COMPANIONS—THE LIFE UNDER WATER—ALONE—THE LAST REFUGE OF THE NAUTILUS—THE MYSTERIOUS GENIUS OF THE ISLAND.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At these words the man arose, and the light shone full upon his face: a magnificent head, with abundance of hair thrown back from a high forehead, a white beard, and an expression of haughtiness.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This man stood, resting one hand upon the divan, from which he had risen. One could see that a slow disease had broken him down, but his voice was still powerful, when he said in English, and in a tone of extreme surprise:——</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I have no name, sir!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I know you!” answered Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Captain Nemo looked at the engineer as if he would have annihilated him. Then, falling back upon the cushions, he murmured:——</p>
<p class="calibre3">“After all, what does it matter; I am dying!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith approached Captain Nemo, and Spilett took his hand, which was hot with fever. The others stood respectfully in a corner of the superb saloon, which was flooded with light.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Captain Nemo withdrew his hand, and signed to Smith and the reporter to be seated.</p>
<p class="calibre3">All looked at him with lively emotion. Here was the being whom they had called the “genius of the island,” the being whose intervention had been so efficacious, the benefactor to whom they owed so much. Before their eyes, here where Pencroff and Neb had expected to find some godlike creature, was only a man-a dying man!</p>
<p class="calibre3">But how did Smith know Captain Nemo? Why had the latter sprung up on hearing that name pronounced?</p>
<p class="calibre3">The Captain had taken his seat upon the divan, and, leaning upon his arm, he regarded the engineer, who was seated near him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You know the name I bore?” he asked.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I know it as well as I know the name of this admirable submarine apparatus.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The Nautilus,” said the Captain, with a half smile.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The Nautilus.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But do you know-do you know, who I am?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I do.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“For thirty years I have had no communication with the inhabited world, for thirty years have I lived in the depths of the sea, the only place where I have found freedom! Who, now, has betrayed my secret?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“A man who never pledged you his word, Captain Nemo, one who, therefore, cannot be accused of betraying you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The Frenchman whom chance threw in my way?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The same.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then this man and his companions did not perish in the maelstrom into which the Nautilus had been drawn?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“They did not, and there has appeared under the title of <i class="calibre5">Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</i>, a work which contains your history.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The history of but a few months of my life, sir,” answered the Captain, quickly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“True,” replied Smith, “but a few months of that strange life sufficed to make you known—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“As a great criminal, doubtless,” said Captain Nemo, smiling disdainfully. “Yes, a revolutionist, a scourge to humanity.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The engineer did not answer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, sir?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I am unable to judge Captain Nemo,” said Smith, “at least in what concerns his past life. I, like the world at large, am ignorant of the motives for this strange existence, and I am unable to judge of the effects without knowing the causes, but what I do know is that a beneficent hand has been constantly extended to us since our arrival here, that we owe everything to a being good, generous, and powerful, and that this being, powerful, generous, and good, is you, Captain Nemo!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is I,” answered the captain, quietly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The engineer and the reporter had risen, the others had drawn near, and the gratitude which swelled their hearts would have sought expression in words and gesture, when Captain Nemo signed to them to be silent, and in a voice more moved, doubtless, than he wished:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“When you have heard me,” he said. And then, in a few short, clear sentences, he told them the history of his life.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The history was brief. Nevertheless, it took all his remaining strength to finish it. It was evident that he struggled against an extreme feebleness. Many times Smith urged him to take some rest, but he shook his head, like one who knew that for him there would be no to-morrow, and when the reporter offered his services—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“They are useless,” he answered, “my hours are numbered.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Captain Nemo was an Indian prince, the Prince Dakkar, the son of the rajah of the then independent territory of Bundelkund, and nephew of the hero of India, Tippo Saib. His father sent him, when ten years old, to Europe, where he received a complete education; and it was the secret intention of the rajah to have his son able some day to engage in equal combat with those whom he considered as the oppressors of his country.</p>
<p class="calibre3">From ten years of age until he was thirty, the Prince Dakkar, with superior endowments, of high heart and courage, instructed himself in everything; pushing his investigations in science, literature, and art to the uttermost limits.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He travelled over all Europe. His birth and fortune made his company much sought after, but the seductions of the world possessed no charm for him. Young and handsome, he remained serious, gloomy, with an insatiable thirst for knowledge, with implacable anger fixed in his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He hated. He hated the only country where he had never wished to set foot, the only nation whose advances he had refused: he hated England more and more as he admired her. This Indian summed up in his own person all the fierce hatred of the vanquished against the victor. The invader is always unable to find grace with the invaded. The son of one of those sovereigns whose submission to the United Kingdom was only nominal, the prince of the family of Tippo-Saib, educated in ideas of reclamation and vengeance, with a deep-seated love for his poetic country weighed down with the chains of England, wished never to place his foot on that land, to him accursed, that land to which India owed her subjection.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The Prince Dakkar became an artist, with a lively appreciation of the marvels of art; a savant familiar with the sciences; a statesman educated in European courts. In the eyes of a superficial observer, he passed, perhaps, for one of those cosmopolites, curious after knowledge, but disdaining to use it; for one of those opulent travellers, high-spirited and platonic, who go all over the world and are of no one country.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was not so. This artist, this savant, this man was Indian to the heart, Indian in his desire for vengeance, Indian in the hope which he cherished of being able some day to re-establish the rights of his country, of driving on the stranger, of making it independent.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He returned to Bundelkund in the year 1849. He married a noble Indian woman whose heart bled as his did at the woes of their country. He had two children whom he loved. But domestic happiness could not make him forget the servitude of India. He waited for an opportunity. At length it came.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The English yoke was pressed, perhaps, too heavily upon the Indian people. The Prince Dakkar became the mouthpiece of the malcontents. He instilled into their spirits all the hatred he felt against the strangers. He went over not only the independent portions of the Indian peninsula, but into those regions directly submitted to the English control. He recalled to them the grand days of Tippo-Saib, who died heroically at Seringapatam for the defense of his country.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In 1857 the Sepoy mutiny broke forth. Prince Dakkar was its soul. He organized that immense uprising. He placed his talents and his wealth at the service of that cause. He gave himself; he fought in the first rank; he risked his life as the humblest of those heroes who had risen to free their country; he was wounded ten times in twenty battles, and was unable to find death when the last soldiers of independence fell before the English guns.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Never had British rule in India been in such danger; and, had the Sepoys received the assistance from without which they had hoped for, Asia would not to-day, perhaps, be under the dominion of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At that time the name of Prince Dakkar was there illustrious. He never hid himself, and he fought openly. A price was put upon his head, and although he was not delivered up by any traitor, his father, mother, wife, and children suffered for him before he knew of the dangers which they ran on his account.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Once again right fell before might. Civilization never goes backwards, and her laws are like those of necessity. The Sepoys were vanquished, and the country of the ancient rajahs fell again under the strict rule of England.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Prince Dakkar, unable to die, returned again to his mountains in Bundelkund. There, thenceforward alone, he conceived an immense disgust against all who bore the name of man—a hatred and a horror of the civilized world—and wishing to fly from it, he collected the wreck of his fortune, gathered together twenty of his most faithful companions, and one day disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Where did Prince Dakkar seek for that independence which was refused him upon the inhabited earth? Under the waters, in the depths of the seas, where no one could follow him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">From a man of war he became a man of science. On a desert island of the Pacific he established his workshops, and there he constructed a submarine ship after plans of his own. By means which will some day be known, he utilized electricity, that incommensurable force, for all the necessities of his apparatus as a motor, for lighting and for heat. The sea, with its infinite treasures, its myriads of fishes, its harvests of varech and sargassum, its enormous mammifers, and not only all that nature held, but all that man had lost, amply sufficed for the needs of the Prince and his equipage;—and thus he accomplished his heart’s desire, to have no further communication with the earth. He named his submarine ship the Nautilus, he called himself Captain Nemo, and he disappeared under the seas.</p>
<p class="calibre3">During many years, the Captain visited all the oceans, from one pole to the other. Pariah of the earth, he reaped the treasures of the unknown worlds. The millions lost in Vigo Bay, in 1702, by the Spanish galleons, furnished him with an inexhaustible mine of wealth, which he gave, anonymously, to people fighting for their independence.</p>
<p class="calibre3">For years he had had no communication with his kindred, when, during the night of the 6th of November, 1866, three men were thrown upon his deck. They were a French professor, his servant, and a Canadian fisherman. These men had been thrown overboard by the shock of the collision between the Nautilus and the United States frigate Abraham Lincoln, which had given it chase.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Captain Nemo learned from the Professor that the Nautilus, sometimes taken for a gigantic mammifer of the cetacean family, sometimes for a submarine apparatus containing a gang of pirates, was hunted in every sea.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Captain Nemo could have thrown these three men, whom chance had thrown across his mysterious life, into the ocean. He did not do it, he kept them prisoners, and, during seven months, they were able to perceive all the marvels of a voyage of 20,000 leagues under the sea.</p>
<p class="calibre3">One day, the 22nd of June, 1867, these three men, who knew nothing of Captain Nemo’s past life, seized the boat belonging to the Nautilus and attempted to escape. But just then the Nautilus was upon the coast of Norway in the eddy of the Maelstrom, and the Captain believed that the fugitives, caught in its terrible vortex, had been swallowed up in the gulf. He was unaware that the Frenchman and his companions had been miraculously thrown upon the coast, that the fishermen of the Loffodin Islands had rescued them, and that the Professor, on his return to France, had published a book in which seven months of this strange and adventurous navigation was narrated.</p>
<p class="calibre3">For a long time Captain Nemo continued this mode of life, traversing the sea. One by one his companions died and found their rest in the coral cemetery at the bottom of the Pacific, and in time Captain Nemo was the last survivor of those who had sought refuge in the depths of the oceans.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He was then sixty years old. As he was alone, it was necessary to take his Nautilus to one of those submarine ports which served him in former days as a harbor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">One of these ports was under Lincoln Island, and was the present asylum of the Nautilus. For six years the Captain had remained there awaiting that death which would reunite him with his companions, when chance made him witness to the fall of the balloon which carried the prisoners. Clothed in his impermeable jacket, he was walking under the water, some cables’ lengths from the shore of the islet, when the engineer was thrown into the sea. A good impulse moved Captain Nemo—and he saved Cyrus Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the arrival of these five castaways he wished to go from them, but his port of refuge was closed. Some volcanic action had raised up the basalt so that the Nautilus could not cross the entrance to the crypt, although there was still sufficient water for a boat of light draught.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Captain Nemo, therefore, remained and watched these men, thrown without resources upon a desert island, but he did not wish to be seen. Little by little, as he saw their honest, energetic lives, how they were bound together in fraternal amity, he interested himself in their efforts. In spite of himself, he found out all the secrets of their existence. Clothed in his impermeable jacket, he could easily reach the bottom of the well in Granite House, and climbing by the projections of the rock to its mouth, he heard the colonists talk of their past and discuss their present and future. He learned from them of the struggle of America against itself, for the abolition of slavery. Yes! these men were worthy to reconcile Captain Nemo with that humanity which they represented so honestly on the island.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Captain Nemo had saved Smith. It was he who had led the dog to the Chimneys, who threw Top out of the water, who stranded the box of useful articles on Jetsam Point, who brought the canoe down the Mercy, who threw the cord from Granite House, when it was attacked by the monkeys, who made known the presence of Ayrton on Tabor Island by means of the paper inclosed in the bottle, who blew up the brig by means of a torpedo, who saved Herbert from certain death by bringing the quinine, who, finally, killed the convicts by those electric balls which he employed in his submarine hunting excursions. Thus was explained all those seemingly supernatural incidents, which, all of them, attested the generosity and the power of the Captain.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Nevertheless, this intense misanthrope thirsted to do good. He had some useful advice to give to his proteges, and moreover, feeling the approach of death, he had summoned, as we have seen, the colonists from Granite House, by means of the wire which reached from the corral to the Nautilus. Perhaps he would not have done it, had he thought that Smith knew enough of his history to call him by his name of Nemo.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The Captain finished the recital of his life, and then Smith spoke. He recalled all the instances of the salutary influences exercised over the colonists, and then, in the name of his companions, and in his own, he thanked this generous being for all that he had done.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But Captain Nemo had never dreamed of asking any return for his services. One last thought agitated his spirit, and, before taking the hand which the engineer held out to him, he said:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Now, sir, you know my life, judge of it!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">In speaking thus, the Captain evidently alluded to an incident of a serious nature which had been witnessed by the three strangers on the Nautilus—an incident which the French professor had necessarily recounted in his book, an incident whose very recital was terrible.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In brief, some days before the flight of the professor and his companions, the Nautilus, pursued by a frigate in the North Atlantic, had rushed upon her like a battering-ram, and sunk her without mercy.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith, understanding this allusion, made no answer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It was an English frigate, sir!” cried Captain Nemo, becoming for the moment Prince Dakkar, “an English frigate, you understand! She attacked me! I was shut in, in a narrow and shallow bay; I had to pass out, and—I passed!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then, speaking with more calmness:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I had right and justice on my side,” he added. “I did good when I could, and evil when I must. All justice is not in forgiveness.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Some moments of silence followed this response, and Captain Nemo asked again:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What do you think of me?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith took the hand of the Captain, and answered him in a grave voice:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Captain, your mistake has been in believing that you could bring back the old order of things, and you have struggled against necessary progress. It was one of those errors which some of us admire, others blame, but of which God alone can judge, and which the human mind exonerates. We can disagree with one who misleads himself in an intention which he believes laudable, and at the same time esteem him. Your error is of a kind which does not preclude admiration, and your name has nothing to fear from the judgment of history. She loves heroic follies, though she condemns the results which follow.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The breast of Captain Nemo heaved; he raised his hand towards heaven.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Was I wrong, or was I right?” he murmured.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith continued:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“All great actions return to God, from whom they came! Captain Nemo, the worthy men here, whom you have succored, will always weep for you!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Herbert approached him. He knelt down and took the hand of the captain, and kissed it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">A tear glistened in the eye of the dying man.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“My child,” he said, “bless you!”</p>
<p class="calibre3"><a id="LIX"></a></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00074" class="calibre2">CHAPTER LIX.</h4>
<p class="calibre3">THE LAST HOURS OF CAPTAIN NEMO—HIS DYING WISHES—A SOUVENIR FOR HIS FRIENDS—HIS TOMB—SOME COUNSEL TO THE COLONISTS—THE SUPREME MOMENT—AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was morning, though no ray of daylight penetrated the vault. The sea, at this moment high, covered the outlet. But the artificial light escaping in long rays from the sides of the Nautilus, had not diminished, and the sheet of water around the vessel glowed resplendent.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Captain Nemo, overcome by an extreme fatigue, fell back upon the divan. They did not dream of transporting him to Granite House, as he had shown a wish to remain among the priceless treasures of the Nautilus, awaiting that death which could not be long in coming.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith and Spilett observed with great attention his prostration. They saw that he was slowly sinking. His strength, formerly so great, was almost gone, and his body was but a frail envelope for the spirit about escaping. All life was concentrated at the heart and brain.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The engineer and the reporter consulted together in low tones. Could they do anything for the dying man? Could they, if not save him, at least prolong his life for a few days? He himself had said that there was no remedy, and he awaited death calmly and without fear.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We can do nothing,” said Spilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What is he dying of?” asked Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Of exhaustion,” answered the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Supposing we take him out into the open air, into the sunlight, perhaps he would revive?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, Pencroff,” responded the engineer, “there is nothing to do. Moreover, Captain Nemo would not be willing to leave here. He has lived on the Nautilus for thirty years, and on the Nautilus he wishes to die.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Doubtless Captain Nemo heard Smith’s words, for, raising himself up a little, and speaking in a feeble but intelligible voice, he said:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You are right. I wish to die here. And I have a request to make.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith and his companions had gathered round the divan, and they arranged the cushions so that the dying man was more comfortably placed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They saw that his gaze was fixed upon the marvels of the saloon, lit up by the rays of electric light sifting through the arabesques of the luminous ceiling. He looked upon the pictures, those <i class="calibre5">chefs d’œuvre</i> of Italian, Flemish, French, and Spanish masters, which hung on the tapestried walls, upon the marbles and bronzes, upon the magnificent organ at the opposite end of the saloon, upon the glasses arranged around a central vase in which were disposed the rarest products of the seas, marine plants, zoophytes, chaplets of pearls of an inappreciable value, and at length his attention was fixed upon this device, the device of the Nautilus inscribed upon the front of this museum:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">MOBILIS IN MOBILI.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It seemed as if he wished to caress with his regard, one last time, those <i class="calibre5">chefs d’oeuvre</i> of art and nature which had been ever visible to him in the years of his sojourn in the depths of the sea!</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith respected Captain Nemo’s silence. He waited for him to speak.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After some moments, during which passed before him, doubtless, his whole life, Cap-Nemo turned to the colonists and said:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You wish to do me a favor?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Captain, we would give our lives to prolong yours!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, then, promise me that you will execute my last wishes, and I will be repaid for all that I have done for you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We promise,” answered Smith, speaking for his companions and himself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“To-morrow,” said the Captain, “to-morrow I will be dead.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">He made a sign to Herbert, who was about to protest.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“To-morrow I will be dead, and I wish for no other tomb than the Nautilus. It is my coffin! All my friends rest at the bottom of the sea, and I wish to rest there also.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">A profound silence followed the words of Captain Nemo.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Attend to what I say,” he continued. “The Nautilus is imprisoned in this grotto. But if she cannot leave this prison, she can at least sink herself in the abyss, which will cover her and guard my mortal remains.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists listened religiously to the words of the dying man.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“To-morrow, after I am dead, Mr. Smith,” continued the Captain, “you and your companions will leave the Nautilus, all of whose riches are to disappear with me. One single remembrance of Prince Dakkar, whose history you now know, will remain to you. That coffer, there, encloses diamonds worth many millions, most of them souvenirs of the time when, a husband and father, I almost believed in happiness, and a collection of pearls gathered by my friends and myself from the bottom of the sea. With this treasure, you will be able, some time, to accomplish good. In your hands and those of your companions, Mr. Smith, wealth will not be dangerous. I shall be ever present with you in your works.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">After some moments of rest, necessitated by his extreme feebleness, Captain Nemo continued as follows:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“To-morrow, you will take this coffer, you will leave this saloon, and close the door; then you will ascend to the platform of the Nautilus and you will bolt down the hatchway.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We will do it, sir,” replied Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Very well. You will then embark in the boat which brought you here. But, before abandoning the Nautilus, go to the stern, and there, open two large cocks which you will find at the water-line. The water will penetrate and the Nautilus will sink beneath the waves and rest upon the bottom of the abyss.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then, upon a gesture from Smith, the Captain added:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Fear nothing! you will only be burying the dead!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Neither Smith nor his companions could say a word to Captain Nemo. These were his last wishes, and they had nothing else to do but obey them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I have your promise?” asked Captain Nemo.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You have it, sir,” answered the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The Captain made a sign thanking them, and then motioned to be left alone for a few hours. Spilett insisted on remaining with him, in case of an emergency, but the other refused, saying:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I will live till morning, sir.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">All left the salon, passing through the library, the dining-room, and reached the forward part of the vessel, where the electric apparatus, furnishing heat, light, and motive power to the Nautilus was placed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The Nautilus was a <i class="calibre5">chef-d’oeuvre</i> containing <i class="calibre5">chefs-d’oeuvre</i>, which filled the engineer with amazement.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists mounted the platform, which rose seven or eight feet above the water. Then they saw a thick lenticular glass closing up a sort of bull’s-eye, through which penetrated a ray of light. Behind this bull’s-eye was the wheel-house, where the steersman stood when directing the Nautilus under the sea, by means of the electric light.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith and his companions stood here in silence, impressed by what they saw, and what they had heard, and their hearts bled to think that he, their protector, whose arm had been so often raised to aid them, would soon be counted among the dead.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Whatever would be the judgment of posterity upon this, so to say, extra-human existence, Prince Dakkar would always remain one of those strange characters who cannot be forgotten.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What a man!” said Pencroff. “Is it credible that he has lived so at the bottom of the ocean! And to think that he has not found rest even there!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The Nautilus,” observed Ayrton, “would, perhaps, have served us to leave Lincoln Island and gain some inhabited country.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“A thousand devils!” cried Pencroff. “You couldn’t get me to steer such a craft. To sail over the seas is all very well, but under the seas,—no, sir!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I think, Pencroff,” said the reporter, “that it would be easy to manage a submarine apparatus like the Nautilus, and that we would soon get accustomed to it. No storms, no boarding to fear. At some little distance under the waves the waters are as calm as those of a lake.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s likely enough,” answered the sailor, “but give me a stiff breeze and a well rigged ship. A ship is made to go on the water and not under it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“My friends,” said the engineer, “it is useless, at least as far as the Nautilus is concerned, to discuss this question of submarine vessels. The Nautilus is not ours, and we have no right to dispose of it. It could not, moreover, serve us under any circumstances. Aside from the fact that it cannot get out of this cavern, Captain Nemo wishes it to be engulfed with him after his death. His wish is law, and we will obey it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith and his companions, after talking for a while longer, descended into the interior of the Nautilus. There they ate some food and returned to the salon.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Captain Nemo had recovered from his prostration, and his eyes had regained their brilliancy. They saw a smile upon his lips.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists approached him. “Sirs,” said the Captain, “you are brave men, and good and honest. You have given yourselves up to the common cause. I have often watched you. I have loved you. I do love you!—Give me your hand, Mr. Smith.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith gave his hand to the Captain, who pressed it affectionately.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That is well!” he murmured. Then he added:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But I have said enough about myself. I wish to speak of yourselves and of Lincoln Island, on which you have found refuge. You want to leave it?”.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“To come back again!” said Pencroff eagerly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“To return?—Oh! yes, Pencroff,” answered the Captain, smiling, “I know how much you love this island. It has been improved by your care, and it is, indeed, yours.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Our project, Captain,” added Smith, “would be to make it over to the United States, and to establish a station, which would be well situated here in this part of the Pacific.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You think of your country,” replied the Captain. “You work for her prosperity, for her glory. You are right. The Fatherland! It is there we wish to return! It is there we wish to die! And I, I die far from everything that I have loved!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Have you no last wish to have executed,” asked the engineer earnestly, “no souvenir to send to those friends you left in the mountains of India?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, Mr. Smith, I have no friends! I am the last of my race—and I die long after those whom I have known.—But to return to yourselves. Solitude, isolation are sorrowful things, beyond human endurance. I die from having believed that man could live alone!—You wish to leave Lincoln Island and to return to your country. I know that these wretches have destroyed your boat-”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We are building a ship,” said Spilett, “a ship large enough to take us to the nearest country; but if sooner or later we leave the island, we will come back again. Too many associations attach us to the place, for us ever to forget it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Here we met Captain Nemo,” said Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Here only will we find the perfect remembrance of you!” added Herbert.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is here that I will rest in an eternal sleep, if—” answered the Captain.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He hesitated, and, instead of finishing his sentence, said:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Mr. Smith, I wish to speak with you,—with you alone.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The companions of the engineer retired, and Smith remained for some time alone with Captain Nemo. He soon called back his friends, but said nothing to them of the secrets which the dying prince had confided to him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Spilett observed the Captain with extreme attention. He was evidently living by the strength of his will, which could not long hold out against his physical weakness.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The day ended without any change manifesting itself. The colonists did not leave the Nautilus. Night came, although unseen in this crypt.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Captain Nemo did not suffer pain, but sunk slowly. His noble face, pale by the approach of death, was perfectly calm. Now and then he spoke, incoherently, of events in his strange existence.—All saw that life was retreating. His feet and hands were already cold.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Once or twice, he spoke a word to the colonists who were about him, and he looked upon them with that smile which remained when he was no more.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At last, just after midnight, Captain Nemo made a supreme effort, and crossed his arms upon his breast, as if he wished to die in that attitude.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Towards 1 o’clock all the life that was left was concentrated in his expression. One last spark burned in that eye which had formerly flashed fire! Then, murmuring these words, “God and Fatherland,” he expired quietly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith, stooping down, closed the eyes of him who had been Prince Dakkar, who was no more even Captain Nemo.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Herbert and Pencroff wept. Ayrton wiped away a furtive tear. Neb was on his knees near the reporter, who was immobile as a statue.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith raising his hand above the head of the dead man:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“May God receive his soul!” he said, and then, turning towards his friends, he added:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let us pray for him whom we have lost!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">*   *   *   *   *</p>
<p class="calibre3">Some hours later, the colonists, in fulfillment of their promise, carried out the last wishes of the dead.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They left the Nautilus, taking with them the sole souvenir of their benefactor, the coffer containing a hundred fortunes.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The marvellous salon, still flooded with light, was carefully closed. The cover to the hatchway was bolted down in such a manner that not a drop of water could penetrate to the inner chambers of the Nautilus. Then the colonists entered the boat, which was moored beside the submarine ship.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The boat was taken to the stern. There, at the water-line, they opened the two large cocks which communicated with the reservoirs designed to immerse the apparatus.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The cocks were opened, the reservoirs filled, and the Nautilus, sinking slowly, disappeared beneath the sea.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But the colonists were able still to follow her coarse through the lower depths. Her strong light lit up the transparent waters, as the crypt became darkened. Then at length the vast effusion of electric effulgence was effaced, and the Nautilus, the tomb of Captain Nemo, rested upon the bottom of the sea.</p>

<h4 id="pgepubid00075" class="calibre2">CHAPTER LX.</h4>
<p class="calibre3">THE REFLECTIONS OF THE COLONISTS—RENEWAL OF WORK—THE 1ST OF JANUARY, 1869—A SMOKE FROM THE VOLCANO—SYMPTOMS OF AN ERUPTION AYRTON AND SMITH AT THE CORRAL—EXPLORATION OF THE CRYPT DAKKAR —WHAT CAPTAIN NEMO HAD SAID TO THE ENGINEER.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the early morning the colonists reached the entrance of the cavern, which they called Crypt Dakkar, in remembrance of Captain Nemo. The tide was low, and they easily passed under the archway, whose piers were washed by the waves.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The iron boat could remain in this place without danger from the sea; but as additional precaution they drew it up on a little beach on one side of the crypt.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The storm had ceased during the night. The last mutterings of the thunder were dying away in the west. It was not raining, although the sky was still clouded. In short, this month of October, the beginning of the southern spring, did not come in good fashion, and the wind had a tendency to shift from one point of the compass to another, so that it was impossible to say what the weather would be.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith and his companions, on leaving Crypt Dakkar, went towards the corral. On the way Neb and Herbert took care to take up the wire which had been stretched by Captain Nemo, as it might be useful in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre3">While walking the colonists spoke but little. The incidents of this night had made a vivid impression upon them. This unknown, whose influence had protected them so well, this man whom they imagined a genii, Captain Nemo, was no more. His Nautilus and himself were buried in the depths of the abyss. It seemed to each one of them that they were more isolated than before. They were, so to speak, accustomed to count upon this powerful intervention which to-day was wanting, and Spilett, and even Smith, did not escape this feeling. So, without speaking, they followed the road to the corral.</p>
<p class="calibre3">By 9 o’clock the colonists were in Granite House again.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It had been agreed that the construction of the ship should be pushed forward as rapidly as possible, and Smith gave the work more of his time and care than ever before. They did not know what the future might bring forth, and it would be a guarantee of safety for them to have a strong vessel, able to stand rough weather, and large enough to carry them, if need be, a long distance. If, when it was finished, the colonists decided not to leave the island they could at least make the voyage to Tabor Island and leave a notice there. This was an indispensable precaution in case the Scotch yacht returned to these seas, and it must on no account be neglected.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The work was undertaken at once. All worked at it without ceasing, except to prosecute other necessary work. It was important to have the new ship finished in five months, if they wished to make the voyage to Tabor Island before the equinoxial storms would render it impracticable. All the sails of the Speedy had been saved, so that they need not trouble themselves about making rigging.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The year ended in the midst of this work. At the end of two months and a half the ribs had been put in place and the planking began, so that they were able to see that Smith’s plans were excellent. Pencroff worked with ardor, and always grumbled when any of the others left off work to go hunting. It was, nevertheless, necessary to lay in a stock of provisions for the approaching winter. But that made no difference. The honest sailor was unhappy unless every one was at work in the ship-yard. At these times he grumbled and did—he was so put out—the work of half a dozen men.</p>
<p class="calibre3">All this summer season was bad. The heat was overpowering, and the atmosphere, charged with electricity, discharged itself in violent storms. It was seldom that the distant muttering of the thunder was unheard. It was like a dull, but permanent murmur, such as is produced in the equatorial regions of the globe.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the 1st of January, 1869, a terrific storm burst over the island, and the lightning struck in many places. Tall trees were shattered, and among them was one of the enormous micocouliers which shaded the poultry-yard. Had this meteoric storm any relation to the phenomena which were occurring In the bowels of the earth? Was there a sort of connection between the disturbances in the air and those in the interior of the globe. Smith believed it to be so, since the development of these storms was marked by a recrudescence of the volcanic symptoms.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the 3d of January, Herbert, who had gone at daybreak to Prospect Plateau to saddle one of the onagers, saw an immense black cloud rolling out from the summit of the volcano.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Herbert hastened to inform the others, who came at once to look at the mountain.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ah!” said Pencroff, “it is not vapor this time! It seems to me that the giant is not content to breathe, he must smoke!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The image employed by the sailor expressed with exactness the change which had taken place at the mouth of the volcano. For three months the crater had been emitting vapors more or less intense, but there had been no ebullition of mineral matters. This time, instead of vapors, a thick column of smoke rose, like an immense mushroom, above the summit of the mountain.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The chimney is on fire!” said Spilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And we cannot put it out!” answered Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It would be well to sweep the volcanoes,” said Neb, in good earnest.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“All right, Neb,” said Pencroff, laughing. “Will you undertake the job?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith looked attentively at the thick smoke, and at the same time he listened as if he expected to detect some distant rumbling. Then, turning towards his companions, who were at some little distance, he said:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“In truth, my friends, it cannot be denied that an important change has taken place. The volcanic matters are not only in a state of ebullition, they have taken fire, and, without doubt, we are threatened with an eruption!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Very well, sir; we will witness this eruption,” cried Pencroff, “and we will applaud it if it is a success! I don’t think that anything over there need worry us!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, Pencroff,” answered Smith, “for the old course of the lava is open, and, thanks to its position, the crater has heretofore discharged towards the north. Nevertheless—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Nevertheless, since there is nothing to be gained by an eruption, it would be better not to have it,” said the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Who knows?” replied the sailor. “There may be some useful and precious matter in the volcano, which it will be good enough to throw up, which will be advantageous for us!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith shook his head, as a man who anticipated nothing good from this phenomenon. He did not think so lightly of the consequences of an eruption. If the lava, on account of the position of the crater, did not menace the wooded and cultivated portions of the island, other complications might arise. Eruptions are often accompanied by earthquakes, and an island formed, like Lincoln Island, of such different materials: basalt on one side, granite on another, lavas to the north, a mixed soil inland, material which, therefore, could not be solidly bound together, ran the risk of being torn asunder. If, therefore, the outpouring of volcanic substances did not threaten serious results, any movement in the framework upholding the island might be followed by the gravest consequences.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It seems to me,” said Ayrton, who was kneeling down, with his ear to the ground, “it seems to me that I hear a noise, like the rattling of a wagon, loaded with iron bars.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists listened carefully, and were convinced that Ayrton was not mistaken. With the rumbling mingled subterranean roaring, making a sort of “rinfordzando,” which died away slowly, as if from some violent cleavage in the interior of the globe. But no detonation was heard, and it was fair to conclude that the smoke and vapor found a free passage through the central chimney, and, if the escape-pipe was sufficiently large, no explosion need be feared.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Come,” said Pencroff at length, “shall we not go back to work? Let Mount Franklin smoke, brawl, moan, and vomit fire and flames as much as it chooses, but that is no excuse for us to quit work! Come, Ayrton, Neb, all of you, we want all hands to-day! I want our new Good Luck—we will keep the name, will we not?—to be moored in Balloon Harbor before two months are passed! So there is not an hour to be lost!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">All the colonists went down to the shipyard and worked steadily all day without giving too much thought to the volcano, which could not be seen from the beach before Granite House. But once or twice heavy shadows obscured the sunlight, and, as the was day perfectly clear, it was evident that thick clouds of smoke were passing between the sun’s disc and the island. Smith and Spilett noticed these sombre voyagers, and talked of the progress that the volcanic phenomenon was making, but they did not cease work. It was, moreover, of great importance, in every sense, that the ship should be finished with as little delay as possible. In the presence of events which might happen, the security of the colonists would be better assured. Who could say but that this ship might not, some day, be their sole refuge?</p>
<p class="calibre3">That evening, after supper, Smith, Spilett, and Herbert climbed to the plateau. It was already dark, and they would be able to distinguish whether flames or incandescent matter was mingled with the smoke and vapor of the volcano.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The crater is on fire!” cried Herbert, who, more active than his companions, had reached the plateau the first.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Mount Franklin, six miles distant, appeared like a gigantic torch, with fuliginous flames twisting about its summit. So much smoke, such quantities of scoriæ and cinders, perhaps, were mingled with the flames, that their light did not glare upon the shades of night. But a sort of dull yellow glow spread over the island, making dimly visible the higher masses of forest. Enormous clouds obscured the heavens, between which glittered a few stars.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The progress is rapid,” said the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is not astonishing,” answered the reporter. “The volcano has been awake for some time already. You remember, Cyrus, that the first vapors appeared about the time we were searching the mountain for the retreat of Captain Nemo. That was, if I am not mistaken, about the 15th of October.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes” replied Herbert, “two months and a half ago.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The subterranean fires have been brooding for ten weeks,” continued Spilett, “and it is not astonishing that they develop now with this violence.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Do not you feel certain vibrations in the ground?” asked Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I think so,” replied Spilett, “but an earthquake—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I did not say that we were menaced by an earthquake,” said Smith, “and Heaven preserve us from one! No. These vibrations are due to the effervesence of the central fire. The crust of the earth is nothing more than the covering of a boiler, and you know how the covering of a boiler, under pressure, vibrates like a sonorous plate. That is what is happening at this moment.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What magnificent flames!” cried Herbert, as a sheaf of fire shot up, unobscured by the vapors, from the crater. From its midst luminous fragments and bright scintillations were thrown in every direction. Some of them pierced the dome of smoke, leaving behind them a perfect cloud of incandescent dust. This outpouring was accompanied by rapid detonations like the discharge of a battery of mitrailleuses.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith, the reporter, and the lad, after having passed an hour on Prospect Plateau, returned to Granite House. The engineer was pensive, and so much preoccupied that Spilett asked him if he anticipated any near danger.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes and no,” responded Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But the worst that could happen,” said the reporter, “would be an earthquake, which would overthrow the island. And I don’t think that is to be feared, since the vapors and lava have a free passage of escape.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I do not fear an earthquake,” answered Smith, “of the ordinary kind, such as are brought about by the expansion of subterranean vapors. But other causes may bring about great disaster.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“For example?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I do not know exactly—I must see—I must visit the mountain. In a few days I shall have made up my mind.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Spilett asked no further questions, and soon, notwithstanding the increased violence of the volcano, the inhabitants of Granite House slept soundly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Three days passed, the 4th 5th, and 6th of January, during which they worked on the ship, and, without explaining himself further, the engineer hastened the work as much as possible. Mount Franklin was covered with a sinister cloud, and with the flames vomited forth incandescent rocks, some of which fell back into the crater. This made Pencroff, who wished to look upon the phenomenon from an amusing side, say—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Look! The giant plays at cup and ball! He is a juggler.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">And, indeed, the matters vomited forth fell back into the abyss, and it seemed as if the lavas, swollen by the interior pressure, had not yet risen to the mouth of the crater. At least, the fracture on the northeast, which was partly visible, did not pour forth any torrent on the western side of the mountain.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Meanwhile, however pressing the ship-building, other cares required the attention of the colonists in different parts of the island. First of all, they must go to the corral, where the moufflons and goats were enclosed, and renew the provisions for these animals. It was, therefore, agreed that Ayrton should go there the next day, and, as it was customary for but one to do this work, the others were surprised to hear the engineer say to Ayrton:——</p>
<p class="calibre3">“As you are going to the corral to-morrow, I will go with you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Oh! Mr. Smith!” cried the sailor, “our time is very limited, and, if you go off in this way, we lose just that much help!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We will return the next day,” answered Smith, “but I must go to the corral—I wish to see about this eruption.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Eruption! Eruption!” answered Pencroff, with a dissatisfied air. “What is there important about this eruption? It don’t bother me!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Notwithstanding the sailor’s protest, the exploration was decided upon for the next day. Herbert wanted to go with Smith, but he did not wish to annoy Pencroff by absenting himself. So, early the next morning, Smith and Ayrton started off with the wagon and onagers.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Over the forest hung huge clouds constantly supplied from Mount Franklin with fuliginous matter. They were evidently composed of heterogeneous substances. It was not altogether the smoke from the volcano that made them so heavy and opaque. Scoriæ in a state of powder, pulverized puzzolan and grey cinder as fine as the finest fecula, were held in suspension in their thick folds. These cinders remain in air, sometimes, for months at a time. After the eruption of 1783, in Iceland, for more than a year the atmosphere was so charged with volcanic powder that the sun’s rays were scarcely visible.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Usually, however, these pulverized matters fall to the earth at once, and it was so in this instance. Smith and Ayrton had hardly reached the corral, when a sort of black cloud, like fine gunpowder, fell, and instantly modified the whole aspect of the ground. Trees, fields, everything was covered with a coating several fingers deep. But, most fortunately, the wind was from the northeast, and the greater part of the cloud was carried off to sea.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That is very curious,” said Ayrton.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is very serious,” answered Smith. This puzzolan, this pulverized pumice stone, all this mineral dust in short, shows how deep-seated is the commotion in the volcano.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But there is nothing to be done.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Nothing, but to observe the progress of the phenomenon. Employ yourself, Ayrton, at the corral, and meanwhile I will go up to the sources of Red Creek and examine the state of the mountain on its western side. Then——”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then, sir?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then we will make a visit to Crypt Dakkar—I wish to see—Well, I will come back for you in a couple of hours.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ayrton went into the corral, and while waiting for the return of the engineer occupied himself with the moufflons and goats, which showed a certain uneasiness before these first symptoms of an eruption.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Meantime Smith had ventured to climb the eastern spurs of the mountain, and he arrived at the place where his companions had discovered the sulphur spring on their first exploration.</p>
<p class="calibre3">How everything was changed! Instead of a single column of smoke, he counted thirteen escaping from the ground as if thrust upward by a piston. It was evident that the crust of earth was subjected in this place to a frightful pressure. The atmosphere was saturated with gases and aqueous vapors. Smith felt the volcanic tufa, the pulverulent cinders hardened by time, trembling beneath him, but he did not yet see any traces of fresh lava.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was the same with the western slope of the mountain. Smoke and flames escaped from the crater; a hail of scoriæ fell upon the soil; but no lava flowed from the gullet of the crater, which was another proof that the volcanic matter had not attained the upper orifice of the central chimney.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And I would be better satisfied if they had!” said Smith to himself. “At least I would be certain that the lavas had taken their accustomed route. Who knows if they may not burst forth from some new mouth? But that is not the danger! Captain Nemo has well foreseen it! No! the danger is not there!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith went forward as far as the enormous causeway, whose prolongation enframed Shark Gulf. Here he was able to examine the ancient lava marks. There could be no doubt that the last eruption had been at a far distant epoch.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then he returned, listening to the subterranean rumblings, which sounded like continuous thunder, and by 9 o’clock he was at the corral.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ayrton was waiting for him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The animals are attended to, sir,” said he.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“All right, Ayrton.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“They seem to be restless, Mr. Smith.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, it is their instinct, which does not mislead them.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“When you are ready—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Take a lantern and tinder, Ayrton, and let us go.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ayrton did as he was told. The onagers had been unharnessed and placed in the corral, and Smith, leading, took the route to the coast.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They walked over a soil covered with the pulverulent matter which had fallen from the clouds. No animal appeared. Even the birds had flown away. Sometimes a breeze passed laden with cinders, and the two colonists, caught in the cloud, were unable to see. They had to place handkerchiefs over their eyes and nostrils or they would have been blinded and suffocated.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Under these circumstances they could not march rapidly. The air was heavy, as if all the oxygen had been burned out of it, making it unfit to breathe. Every now and then they had to stop, and it was after 10 o’clock when the engineer and his companion reached the summit of the enormous heap of basaltic and porphyrytic rocks which formed the northwest coast of the island.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They began to go down this abrupt descent, following the detestable road, which, during that stormy night had led them to Crypt Dakkar. By daylight this descent was less perilous, and, moreover, the covering of cinders gave a firmer foothold to the slippery rocks.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The projection was soon attained, and, as the tide was low, Smith and Ayrton found the opening to the crypt without any difficulty.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Is the boat there?” asked the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, sir,” answered Ayrton, drawing the boat towards him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let us get in, then, Ayrton,” said the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The two embarked in the boat. Ayrton lit the lantern, and, placing it in the bow of the boat, took the oars, and Smith, taking the tiller, steered into the darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The Nautilus was no longer here to illuminate this sombre cavern. Perhaps the electric irradiation still shone under the waters, but no light came from the abyss where Captain Nemo reposed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The light of the lantern was barely sufficient to permit the engineer to advance, following the right hand wall of the crypt. A sepulchral silence reigned in this portion of the vault, but soon Smith heard distinctly the mutterings which came from the interior of the earth.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is the volcano,” he said.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Soon, with this noise, the chemical combinations betrayed themselves by a strong odor, and sulphurous vapors choked the engineer and his companion.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is as Captain Nemo feared,” murmured Smith, growing pale. “We must go on to the end.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Twenty-five minutes after having left the opening the two reached the terminal wall and stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith standing on the seat, moved the lantern about over this wall, which separated the crypt from the central chimney of the volcano. How thick was it? Whether 100 feet or but 10 could not be determined. But the subterranean noises were too plainly heard for it to be very thick.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The engineer, after having explored the wall along a horizontal line, fixed the lantern to the end of an oar and went over it again at a greater height.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There, through scarcely visible cracks, came a pungent smoke, which infected the air of the cavern. The wall was striped with these fractures, and some of the larger ones came to within a few feet of the water.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At first, Smith rested thoughtful. Then he murmured these words:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes! Captain Nemo was right! There is the danger, and it is terrible!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ayrton said nothing, but, on a sign from the engineer, he took up the oars, and, a half hour later, he and Smith came out of Crypt Dakkar.</p>

<p class="calibre3">SMITH’S RECITAL—HASTENING THE WORK—A LAST VISIT TO THE CORRAL—THE COMBAT BETWEEN THE FIRE AND THE WATER—THE ASPECT OF THE ISLAND—THEY DECIDE TO LAUNCH THE SHIP—THE NIGHT OF THE 8TH OF MARCH.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The next morning, the 8th of January, after a day and night passed at the corral, Smith and Ayrton returned to Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then the engineer assembled his companions, and told them that Lincoln Island was in fearful danger—a danger which no human power could prevent.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“My friends,” said he,—and his voice betrayed great emotion,—“Lincoln Island is doomed to destruction sooner or later; the cause is in itself and there is no means of removing it!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists looked at each other. They did not understand him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Explain yourself, Cyrus,” said Spilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I will, or rather I will give you the explanation which Captain Nemo gave me, when I was alone with him.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Captain Nemo!” cried the colonists.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes; it was the last service he rendered us before he died.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The last service!” cried Pencroff. “The last service! You think, because he is dead, that he will help us no more!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What did he say?” asked the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“This, my friends,” answered the engineer. “Lincoln Island is not like the other islands of the Pacific, and a particular event, made known to me by Captain Nemo, will cause, sooner or later, the destruction of its submarine framework.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Destruction of Lincoln Island! What an idea!” cried Pencroff, who, in spite of his respect for Smith, could not help shrugging his shoulders.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Listen to me, Pencroff,” continued the engineer. “This is what Captain Nemo ascertained and what I verified yesterday In Crypt Dakkar. The crypt extends under the island as far as the volcano, and is only separated from the central chimney by the wall. Now this wall is seamed with fractures and cracks, through which the sulphurous gas is already escaping.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well?” asked Pencroff, wrinkling his forehead.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, I have ascertained that these fractures are widening under the pressure from within, that the basalt wall la gradually bursting open, and that, sooner or later, it will give a passage to the waters of the sea.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s all right!” exclaimed Pencroff, trying still to make light of the subject. “That’s all right! The sea will put out the volcano, and that will be the end of it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, that will be the end of it!” answered Smith. “On the day that the sea rushes through the wall and penetrates by the central chimney to the bowels of the island, where the eruptive matter is boiling, on that day, Pencroff, Lincoln Island will go up, as Sicily would go up, if the Mediterranean was emptied into Aetna!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists made no reply. They understood the threatened danger.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was no longer doubtful that the island was menaced by a frightful explosion. That it would last only as long as the wall to Crypt Dakkar remained intact. This was not a question of months, nor of weeks, bat of days, of hours, perhaps!</p>
<p class="calibre3">The first sensation the colonists experienced was one of profound sorrow. They did not think of the peril which menaced them directly, but of the destruction of that land which had given them asylum, of that island which they had cultivated, which they loved, which they wished to render so prosperous some day! All their labor uselessly employed, all their work lost!</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff did not attempt to hide the tears which rolled down his cheeks.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They talked for some little time longer. The chances which they might count upon were discussed; but, in conclusion, they realized that not an hour was to be lost; that the ship must be completed as soon as possible, as, now, it was the only chance of safety left, to the inhabitants of Lincoln Island!</p>
<p class="calibre3">All hands were required. Where was the use, now, of sowing, or harvesting, of hunting or increasing the reserve at Granite House? The present contents of the magazine were sufficient to provision the ship for as long a voyage as she could make! What was necessary was that these should be at</p>
<p class="calibre3">the disposal of the colonists before the accomplishment of the inevitable catastrophe.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The work was undertaken with feverish eagerness. By the 23d of January the ship was half planked. Up to this time there had been no change in the volcano. It was always the vapors, the smoke mixed with flames and pierced by incandescent stones, which escaped from the crater. But during the night of the 23d the upper cone, which formed the cap of the volcano, was lifted off by the pressure of the lava, which had reached the level of the lower cone. A terrible noise was heard. The colonists, believing that the island was going to pieces, rushed out of Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was 2 o’clock in the morning. The heavens were on fire. The upper cone—a mass a thousand feet high, and weighing thousands of millions of pounds—had been thrown upon the island, making the earth tremble. Happily, this cone leaned to the north, and it fell upon the plain of sand and tufa which lay between the volcano and the sea. The crater, by this means greatly widened, threw towards the sky a light so intense, that, by the simple effect of reverberation, the atmosphere seemed to be incandescent. At the same time a torrent of lava swelled up over this new summit, falling in long streams, like water escaping from an overflowing vase, and a thousand fiery serpents writhed upon the talus of the volcano.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The corral! The corral!” cried Ayrton.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was, indeed, towards the corral that the lava took their way, following the slope of the new crater, and, consequently, the fertile parts of the island. The sources of Red Creek, and Jacamar Wood were threatened with immediate destruction.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At the cry of Ayrton, the colonists had rushed towards the stable of the onagers, and harnessed the animals. All had but one thought. To fly to the corral and let loose the beasts confined there.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Before 3 o’clock they were there. Frightful cries indicated the terror of the moufflons and goats. Already a torrent of incandescent matter, of liquified minerals, fell over the mountain spur upon the plain, destroying that side of the palisade. The gate was hastily opened by Ayrton, and the animals, wild with terror, escaped in every direction.</p>
<p class="calibre3">An hour later the boiling lava filled the corral, volatilizing the water of the little brook which traversed it, firing the house, which burned like a bit of stubble, devouring to the last stake the surrounding palisade. Nothing was left of the corral.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists wanted to struggle against this invasion; they had tried it, but foolishly and uselessly: man is helpless before these grand cataclysms.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The morning of the 24th arrived. Smith and his companions, before returning to Granite House, wished to observe the definite direction which this inundation of lava would take. The general slope of the ground from Mount Franklin was towards the east coast, and it was to be feared that, notwithstanding the thick Jacamar Woods, the torrent would extend to Prospect Plateau.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The lake will protect us,” said Spilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I hope so,” answered Smith. But that was all he said.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists would have liked to have advanced as far as the place on which the upper cone of Mount Franklin abutted, but their passage was barred by the lavas, which followed, on the one hand, the valley of Red Creek, and, on the other, the course of Fall River, vaporizing these two streams in their passage. There was no possible way of crossing this stream; it was necessary, on the contrary, to fly before it. The flattened volcano was no longer recognizable. A sort of smooth slab terminated it, replacing the old crater. Two outlets, broken in the south and east sides, poured forth unceasing streams of lava, which formed two distinct currents. Above the new crater, a cloud of smoke and cinders mixed with the vapors of the sky, and hung over the island. Peals of thunder mingled with the rumbling of the mountain. Burning rocks were thrown up thousands of feet, bursting in the sky and scattering like grape-shot. The heavens answered with lightning-flashes the eruption of the volcano.</p>
<p class="calibre3">By 7 o’clock the colonists were no longer able to keep their position on the edge of Jacamar Wood. Not only did the projectiles begin to fall about them, but the lavas, overflowing the bed of Red Creek, threatened to cut off the road from the corral. The first ranks of trees took fire, and their sap, vaporized, made them explode like fire-crackers; while others, less humid, remained intact in the midst of the inundation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists started back. The torrent, owing to the slope of the land, gained eastward rapidly, and as the lower layers of lava hardened, others, boiling, covered them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Meantime the principal current in the Red Creek Valley became more and more threatening. All that part of the forest was surrounded, and enormous clouds of smoke rolled above the trees, whose roots were already in the lava.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists stopped at the lake shore, half a mile from the mouth of Red Creek. A question of life or death was about to be decided for them. Smith, accustomed to think and reason in the presence of danger, and aware that he was speaking to men who could face the truth, whatever it might be, said to them:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Either the lake will arrest this current, and a part of the island will be preserved from complete devastation, or the current will invade the forests of the Far West, and not a tree, not a plant will be left upon the face of the ground. We will have, upon these rocks stripped of life, the prospect of a death which the explosion of the island may anticipate!</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then,” cried Pencroff, crossing his arms and stamping his foot on the ground, “it is useless to work on the ship! Isn’t that so?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Pencroff,” answered Smith, “it is necessary to do one’s duty to the end.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">At this moment, the flood of lava, after having eaten its way through the splendid trees of the forest, neared the lake. There was a certain depression in the ground, which, if it had been larger, might, perhaps, suffice to hold the torrent.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let us try!” cried Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The idea of the engineer was instantly understood by all. It was necessary to dam, so to speak, this torrent and force it into the lake.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists ran to the shipyard and brought back from there shovels, picks, and hatchets, and by means of earthworks and hewn trees they succeeded, in a few hours, in raising a barrier three feet high and some hundreds of feet long. It seemed to them, when they had finished, that they had not worked more than a few minutes!</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was time. The liquified matter already reached the extremity of the barrier. The flood spread like a swollen river seeking to overflow its banks and threatening to break down the only obstacle which could prevent its devastating all the Far West. But the barrier was sufficient to withstand it, and, after one terrible moment of hesitation, it precipitated itself into Lake Grant by a fall twenty feet high.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists, breathless, without a word, without a gesture, looked upon this struggle of the elements.</p>
<p class="calibre3">What a sight was this, the combat between fire and water! What pen can describe this scene of marvellous horror; what pencil can portray it? The water hissed and steamed at the contact of the boiling lavas. The steam was thrown, whirling, to an immeasurable height in the air, as if the valves of an immense boiler had been suddenly opened. But, great as was the mass of water contained in the lake, it must, finally, be absorbed, since it was not renewed, while the torrent, fed from an inexhaustible source, was ceaselessly pouring in fresh floods of incandescent matter.</p>
