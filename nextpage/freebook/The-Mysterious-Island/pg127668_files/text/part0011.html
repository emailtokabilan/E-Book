<p class="calibre3">“I agree with you, Neb,” said Spilett; “but that is no reason for not making the attempt. Whether we find this mysterious being or not, we shall have fulfilled our duty towards him.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And what is your opinion, my boy?” said the engineer, turning to Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ah,” cried Herbert, his eye brightening; “I want to thank him, the man who saved you first and now has saved us all.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It wouldn’t be unpleasant for any of us, my boy,” returned Pencroff. “I am not curious, but I would give one of my eyes to see him face to face.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And you, Ayrton?” asked the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Mr. Smith,” replied Ayrton, “I can give no advice. Whatever you do will be right, and whenever you want my help in your search, I am ready.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Thanks, Ayrton,” said Smith, “but I want a more direct answer. You are our comrade, who has offered his life more than once to save ours, and we will take no important step without consulting you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I think, Mr. Smith,” replied Ayrton, “that we ought to do everything to discover our unknown benefactor. He may be sick or suffering. I owe him a debt of gratitude which I can never forget, for he brought you to save me. I will never forget him!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is settled,” said Smith. “We will begin our search as soon as possible. We will leave no part of the island unexplored. We will pry into its most secret recesses, and may our unknown friend pardon our zeal!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">For several days the colonists were actively at work haymaking and harvesting. Before starting upon their exploring tour, they wanted to finish all their important labors. Now, too, was the time for gathering the vegetable products of Tabor Island. Everything had to be stored; and, happily, there was plenty of room in Granite House for all the riches of the island. There all was ranged in order, safe from man or beast. No dampness was to be feared in the midst of this solid mass of granite. Many of the natural excavations in the upper corridor were enlarged by the pick, or blown out by mining, and Granite House thus became a receptacle for all the goods of the colony.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The brig’s guns were pretty pieces of cast-steel, which, at Pencroff’s instance, were hoisted, by means of tackle and cranes, to the very entrance of Granite House; embrasures were constructed between the windows, and soon they could be seen stretching their shining nozzles through the granite wall. From this height these fire-breathing gentry had the range of all Union Bay. It was a little Gibraltar, to whose fire every ship off the islet would inevitably be exposed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Mr. Smith,” said Pencroff one day—it was the 8th of November—“now that we have mounted our guns, we ought to try their range.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“For what purpose?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, we ought to know how far we can send a ball.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Try, then, Pencroff,” answered the engineer; “but don’t use our powder, whose stock I do not want to diminish; use pyroxyline, whose supply will never fail.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Can these cannon support the explosive force of pyroxyline?” asked the reporter, who was as eager as Pencroff to try their new artillery.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I think so. Besides,” added the engineer, “we will be careful.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith had good reason to think that these cannon were well made. They were of cast steel, and breech-loaders, they could evidently bear a heavy charge, and consequently would have a long range, on account of the tremendous initial velocity.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Now,” said Smith, “the initial velocity being a question of the amount of powder in the charge, everything depends upon the resisting power of the metal; and steel is undeniably the best metal in this respect; so that I have great hope of our battery.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The four cannon were in perfect condition. Ever since they had been taken out of the water, Pencroff had made it his business to give them a polish. How many hours had been spent in rubbing them, oiling them, and cleaning the separate parts! By this time they shone as if they had been on board of a United States frigate.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That very day, in the presence of all the colony, including Jup and Top, the new guns were successively tried. They were charged with pyroxyline, which, as we have said, has an explosive force fourfold that of gunpowder; the projectile was cylindro-conical in shape. Pencroff, holding the fuse, stood ready to touch them off.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Upon a word from Smith, the shot was fired. The ball, directed seaward, passed over the islet and was lost in the offing, at a distance which could not be computed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The second cannon was trained upon the rocks terminating Jetsam Point, and the projectile, striking a sharp boulder nearly three miles from Granite House, made it fly into shivers. Herbert had aimed and fired the shot, and was quite proud of his success. But Pencroff was prouder of it even than he. Such a feather in his boy’s cap!</p>
<p class="calibre3">The third projectile, aimed at the downs which formed the upper coast of Union Bay, struck the sand about four miles away, then ricocheted into the water. The fourth piece was charged heavily to test its extreme range, and every one got out of the way for fear it would burst; then the fuse was touched off by means of a long string. There was a deafening report, but the gun stood the charge, and the colonists, rushing to the windows, could see the projectile graze the rocks of Mandible Cape, nearly five miles from Granite House, and disappear in Shark Gulf.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, Mr. Smith,” said Pencroff, who had cheered at every shot, “what do you say to our battery? I should like to see a pirate land now!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Better have them stay away, Pencroff,” answered the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Speaking of that,” said the sailor, “what are we going to do with the six rascals who are prowling about the island? Shall we let them roam about unmolested? They are wild beasts, and I think we should treat them as such. What do you think about it, Ayrton?” added Pencroff, turning towards his companion.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ayrton hesitated for a moment, while Smith regretted the abrupt question, and was sincerely touched when Ayrton answered humbly:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I was one of these wild beasts once, Mr. Pencroff, and I am not worthy to give counsel.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">And, with bent head, he walked slowly away. Pencroff understood him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Stupid ass that I am!” cried he. “Poor Ayrton! and yet he has as good a right to speak as any of us. I would rather have bitten off my tongue than have given him pain! But, to go back to the subject, I think these wretches have no claim to mercy, and that we should rid the island of them.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And before we hunt them down, Pencroff, shall we not wait for some fresh act of hostility?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Haven’t they done enough already?” said the sailor, who could not understand these refinements.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“They may repent,” said Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“They repent!” cried the sailor, shrugging his shoulders.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Think of Ayrton, Pencroff!” said Herbert, taking his hand. “He has become an honest man.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff looked at his companions In stupefaction. He could not admit the possibility of making terms with the accomplices of Harvey, the murderers of the Speedy’s crew.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Be it so!” he said. “You want to be magnanimous to these rascals. May we never repent of it!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What danger do we run if we are on our guard?” said Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“H’m!” said the reporter, doubtfully. “There are six of them, well armed. If each of them sighted one of us from behind a tree—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why haven’t they tried it already?” said Herbert. “Evidently it was not their cue.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Very well, then,” said the sailor, who was stubborn in his opinion, “we will let these worthy fellows attend to their innocent occupations without troubling our heads about them.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Pencroff,” said the engineer, “you have often shown respect for my opinions. Will you trust me once again?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I will do whatever you say, Mr. Smith,” said the sailor, nowise convinced.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, let us wait, and not be the first to attack.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">This was the final decision, with Pencroff in the minority. They would give the pirates a chance, which their own interest might induce them to seize upon, to come to terms. So much, humanity required of them. But they would have to be constantly on their guard, and the situation was a very serious one. They had silenced Pencroff, but, perhaps, after all, his advice would prove sound.</p>
<p class="calibre3"><a id="XLVIII"></a></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00063" class="calibre2">CHAPTER XLVIII.</h4>
<p class="calibre3">THE PROJECTED EXPEDITION—AYRTON AT THE CORRAL—VISIT TO PORT BALLOON—PENCROFF’S REMARKS—DESPATCH SENT TO THE CORRAL—NO ANSWER FROM AYRTON—SETTING OUT NEXT DAY—WHY THE WIRE DID NOT ACT—A DETONATION.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Meanwhile the thing uppermost in the colonists’ thought was to achieve the complete exploration of the island which had been decided upon, an exploration which now would have two objects: —First, to discover the mysterious being whose existence was no longer a matter of doubt; and, at the same time to find out what had become of the pirates, what hiding place they had chosen, what sort of life they were leading, and what was to be feared from them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith would have set off at once, but as the expedition would take several days, it seemed better to load the wagon with all the necessaries for camping out. Now at this time one of the onagers, wounded in the leg, could not bear harness; it must have several days’ rest, and they thought it would make little difference if they delayed the departure a week, that is, till November 20. November in this latitude corresponds to the May of the Northern Hemisphere, and the weather was fine. They were now at the longest days in the year, so that everything was favorable to the projected expedition, which, if it did not attain its principal object, might be fruitful in discoveries, especially of the products of the soil; for Smith intended to explore those thick forests of the Far West, which stretched to the end of Serpentine Peninsula.</p>
<p class="calibre3">During the nine days which would precede their setting out, it was agreed that they should finish work on Prospect Plateau. But Ayrton had to go back to the corral to take care of their domesticated animals. It was settled that he should stay there two days, and leave the beasts with plenty of fodder. Just as he was setting out, Smith asked him if he would like to have one of them with him, as the island was no longer secure. Ayrton replied that it would be useless, as he could do everything by himself, and that there was no danger to fear. If anything happened at or near the corral, he would instantly acquaint the colonists of it by a telegram sent to Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So Ayrton drove off in the twilight, about 9 o’clock, behind one onager, and two hours afterwards the electric wire gave notice that he had found everything in order at the corral.</p>
<p class="calibre3">During these two days Smith was busy at a project which would finally secure Granite House from a surprise. The point was to hide completely the upper orifice of the former weir, which had been already blocked up with stones, and half hidden under grass and plants, at the southern angle of Lake Grant. Nothing could be easier, since by raising the level of the lake two or three feet, the hole would be entirely under water.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now to raise the level, they had only to make a dam across the two trenches by which Glycerine Creek and Waterfall Creek were fed. The colonists were incited to the task, and the two dams, which were only seven or eight feet long, by three feet high, were rapidly erected of closely cemented stones. When the work had been done, no one could have suspected the existence of the subterranean conduit. The little stream which served to feed the reservoir at Granite House, and to work the elevator, had been suffered to flow in its channel, so that water might never be wanting. The elevator once raised, they might defy attack.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This work had been quickly finished, and Pencroff, Spilett, and Herbert found time for an expedition to Port Balloon. The sailor was anxious to know whether the little inlet up which the Good Luck was moored had been visited by the convicts.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“These gentry got to land on the southern shore,” he observed, “and if they followed the line of the coast they may have discovered the little harbor, in which case I wouldn’t give half a dollar for our Good Luck.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">So off the three went in the afternoon of November 10. They were well armed, and as Pencroff slipped two bullets into each barrel of his gun, he had a look which presaged no good to whoever came too near, “beast or man,” as he said. Neb went with them to the elbow of the Mercy, and lifted the bridge after them. It was agreed that they should give notice of their return by firing a shot, when Neb would come back to put down the bridge.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The little band walked straight for the south coast. The distance was only three miles and a half, but they took two hours to walk it. They searched on both sides of the way, both the forest and Tadorn’s Fens; but they found no trace of the fugitives. Arriving at Port Balloon, they saw with great satisfaction that the Good Luck was quietly moored in the narrow inlet, which was so well hidden by the rocks that it could be seen neither from sea nor shore, but only from directly above or below.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“After all,” said Pencroff, “the rascals haven’t been here. The vipers like tall grass better, and we shall find them in the Far-West.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And it’s a fortunate thing,” added Herbert, “for if they had found the Good Luck, they would have made use of her in getting away, and we could never have gone back to Tabor Island.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes,” replied the reporter, “it will be important to put a paper there stating the situation of Lincoln Island, Ayrton’s new residence, in case the Scotch yacht should come after him.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, here is our Good Luck, Mr. Spilett,” said the sailor, “ready to start with her crew at the first signal!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Talking thus, they got on board and walked about the deck. On a sudden the sailor, after examining the bit around which the cable of the anchor was wound, cried,</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hallo! this is a bad business!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What’s the matter, Pencroff?” asked the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The matter is that that knot was never tied by me——”</p>
<p class="calibre3">And Pencroff pointed to a rope which made the cable fast to the bit, so as to prevent its tripping.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“How, never tied by you?” asked Spilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, I can swear to it. I never tie a knot like that.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You are mistaken, Pencroff.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, I’m not mistaken,” insisted the sailor. “That knot of mine is second nature with me.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then have the convicts been on board?” asked Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I don’t know,” said Pencroff, “but somebody has certainly raised and dropped this anchor!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The sailor was so positive that neither Spilett nor Herbert could contest his assertion. It was evident that the beat had shifted place more or less since Pencroff had brought it back to Balloon Harbor. As for the sailor, he had no doubt that the anchor had been pulled up and cast again. Now, why had these manœuvres taken place unless the boat had been used on some expedition?</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then why did we not see the Good Luck pass the offing?” said the reporter, who wanted to raise every possible objection.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But, Mr. Spilett,” answered the sailor, “they could have set out in the night with a good wind, and in two hours have been out of sight of the island.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Agreed,” said Spilett, but I still ask with what object the convicts used the Good Luck, and why, after using her, they brought her back to port?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, Mr. Spilett,” said the sailor, “we will have to include that among our mysterious incidents, and think no more of it. One thing is certain, the Good Luck was there, and is here! If the convicts take it a second time, it may never find its way back again.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then, Pencroff,” said Herbert, “perhaps we had better take the Good Luck back and anchor her in front of Granite House.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I can hardly say,” answered the sailor, “but I think not. The mouth of the Mercy is a bad place for a ship; the sea is very heavy there.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But by hauling it over the sand to the foot of the Chimneys——”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, perhaps,” answered Pencroff. “In any case, as we have to leave Granite House for a long expedition, I believe the Good Luck will be safer here during oar absence, and he will do well to leave her here until the island is rid of these rascals.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That is my opinion, too,” said the reporter. At least in case of bad weather, she will not be exposed as she would be at the mouth of the Mercy.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But if the convicts should pay her another visit?” said Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, my boy,” said Pencroff, “if they do not find the boat here they will search until they do find her; and in our absence there is nothing to prevent their carrying her off from the front of Granite House. I agree with Mr. Spilett that we had better leave her at Balloon Harbor; but if we have not rid the island of these wretches by the time we come back it will be more prudent to take our ship back to Granite House, until we have nothing more to fear from our enemies.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“All right,” said Spilett. “Let us go back now.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">When they returned to Granite House, they told Smith what had happened, and the latter approved their present and future plans. He even promised Pencroff he would examine that part of the channel situated between the island and the coast, so as to see if it would be possible to make an artificial harbor by means of a dam. In this way the Good Luck would be always within reach, in sight of the colonists, and locked up if necessary.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the same evening they sent a telegram to Ayrton, asking him to bring back from the corral a couple of goats, which Neb wished to acclimatize on the plateau. Strange to say, Ayrton did not acknowledge the receipt of this despatch, as was his custom to do. This surprised the engineer, but he concluded that Ayrton was not at the corral at the moment, and perhaps had started on his way back to Granite House. In fact, two days had elapsed since his departure; and it had been agreed that on the evening of the 10th or the morning of the 11th, at latest, he would return.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists were now waiting to see Ayrton on Prospect Plateau. Neb and Herbert both looked after the approach by way of the bridge, so as to let it down when their companion should appear, but when 6 o’clock in the evening came, and there was no sign of Ayrton, they agreed to send another despatch, asking for an immediate answer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The wire at Granite House remained silent.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The uneasiness of the colonists was now extreme. What had happened? “Was Ayrton not at the corral? or, if there, had he not power over his own movements? Ought they to go in search of him on this dark night?</p>
<p class="calibre3">They discussed the point. Some were for going, and others for waiting.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But,” said Herbert, “perhaps some accident has happened to the wires which prevents their working.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That may be,” said the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let us wait until to-morrow,” said Smith. “It is just possible that either Ayrton has not received our despatch, or we have missed his.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">They waited, as may be imagined, with much anxiety. At daylight on the 11th of November, Smith sent a message across the wires, but received no answer. Again, with the same result.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let us set off at once for the corral,” said he.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Aid will armed,” added Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was agreed that Granite House must not be deserted, so Neb was left behind to take charge. After accompanying his companions to Glycerine Creek, he put up the bridge again, and hid behind a tree, to wait either for their return or for that of Ayrton. In case the pirates should appear, and should attempt to force the passage, he would try to defend it with his gun; and in the last resort he would take refuge in Granite House, where, the elevator once drawn up, he would be in perfect safety. The others were to go direct to the corral, and failing to find Ayrton there, were to scour the neighboring woods.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At 6 o’clock in the morning the engineer and his three companions had crossed Glycerine Creek, and Neb posted himself behind a low cliff, crowned by some large dragon trees on the left side of the brook. The colonists, after leaving Prospect Plateau, took the direct route to the corral. They carried their guns on their shoulders, ready to fire at the first sign of hostility. The two rifles and the two guns had been carefully loaded.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On either side of the path was a dense thicket, which might easily hide enemies, who, as they were armed, would be indeed formidable. The colonists walked on rapidly without a word. Top preceded them, sometimes keeping to the path, and sometimes making a detour into the wood, but not appearing to suspect anything unusual; and they might depend upon it that the faithful dog would not be taken by surprise, and would bark at the slightest appearance of danger.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Along this same path Smith and his companions followed the telegraphic wires which connected the corral with Granite House. For the first two miles they did not notice any solution of continuity. The posts were in good condition, the insulators uninjured, and the wire evenly stretched. From this point the engineer noticed that the tension was less complete, and at last, arriving at post No. 74, Herbert, who was ahead of the others, cried, “The wire is broken!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">His companions hastened forward and arrived at the spot where the boy had stopped. There the overturned post was lying across the path. They had discovered the break, and it was evident that the dispatches from Granite House could not have been received at the corral.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It can’t be the wind that has overturned this post,” said Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No,” answered the reporter, “there are marks of footsteps on the ground; it has been uprooted by the hand of man.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Besides, the wire is broken,” added Herbert, showing the two ends of the wire which had been violently torn asunder.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Is the break a fresh one?” asked Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes,” said Herbert, “it was certainly made a very short time ago.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“To the corral! to the corral!” cried the sailor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists were then midway between Granite House and the corral, and had still two miles and a half to go. They started on a run.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In fact, they might well fear that something had happened at the corral. Ayrton doubtless might have sent a telegram which had not arrived. It was not this which alarmed his companions, but a circumstance more remarkable. Ayrton, who had promised to come back the evening before, had not reappeared! The communication, between Granite House and the corral had been out with a sinister design.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They hurried on, their hearts beating quick with fear for their comrade, to whom they were sincerely attached; Were they to find him struck down by the hand of those he had formerly led?</p>
<p class="calibre3">Soon they reached the place where the road lay along by the little brook flowing from Red Creek, which watered the meadows of the corral. They had moderated their pace, so as not to be out of breath at the moment when a deadly struggle might occur. Their guns were uncocked, but loaded. Each of them watched one side of the woods. Top kept up an ill-omened growling.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At last the fenced enclosure appeared behind the trees. They saw no signs of devastation. The door was closed as usual; a profound silence reigned at the corral. Neither the accustomed bleatings of the sheep nor the voice of Ayrton was to be heard.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let us go in,” said Smith, and the engineer advanced, while his companions, keeping guard twenty feet in the rear, stood ready to fire.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith raised the inner latch, and began to push back the door, when Top barked loudly. There was a report from behind the fence, followed by a cry of pain, and Herbert, pierced by a bullet, fell to the ground!</p>
<p class="calibre3"><a id="XLIX"></a></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00064" class="calibre2">CHAPTER XLIX</h4>
<p class="calibre3">THE REPORTER AND PENCROFF IN THE CORRAL—MOVING HERBERT—DESPAIR OF THE SAILOR—CONSULTATION OF THE ENGINEER AND THE REPORTER—MODE OF TREATMENT—A GLIMMER OF HOPE—HOW TO WARN NEB—A FAITHFUL MESSENGER—NEB’S REPLY.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At Herbert’s cry, Pencroff, dropping his gun, sprang towards him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“They have killed him!” cried he. “My boy—they have killed him.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith and Spilett rushed forward. The reporter put his ear to the boy’s heart to see if it were still beating.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“He’s alive,” said he, “but he must be taken—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“To Granite House? Impossible!” said the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“To the corral, then,” cried Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“One moment,” said Smith, and he rushed to the left around the fence. There he found himself face to face with a convict, who fired at him and sent a ball through his cap. An instant later, before he had time to fire again, he fell, struck to the heart by Smith’s poniard, a surer weapon even than his gun.</p>
<p class="calibre3">While this was going on, the reporter and Pencroff hoisted themselves up to the angle of the fence, strode over the top, jumped into the enclosure, made their way into the empty house, and laid Herbert gently down on Ayrton’s bed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">A few minutes afterwards Smith was at his side. At the sight of Herbert, pale and unconscious, the grief of the sailor was intense. He sobbed and cried bitterly; neither the engineer nor the reporter could calm him. Themselves over whelmed with emotion, they could hardly speak.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They did all in their power to save the poor boy’s life. Spilett, in his life of varied experience, had acquired some knowledge of medicine. He knew a little of everything; and had had several opportunities of learning the surgery of gunshot wounds. With Smith’s assistance, he hastened to apply the remedies which Herbert’s condition demanded.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The boy lay in a complete stupor, caused either by the hemorrhage or by concussion of the brain. He was very pale, and his pulse beat only at long intervals, as if every moment about to stop. This, taken in conjunction with his utter loss of consciousness, was a grave symptom. They stripped his chest, and, staunching the blood by means of handkerchiefs, kept bathing the wounds in cold water.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The ball had entered between the third and fourth rib, and there they found the wound. Smith and Spilett turned the poor boy over. At this he uttered a moan so faint that they feared it was his last breath. There was another wound on his back, for the bullet had gone clean through.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Thank Heaven!” said the reporter, “the ball is not in his body; we shall not have to extract it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But the heart?” asked Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The heart has not been touched, or he would be dead.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Dead!” cried Pencroff, with a groan. He had only heard the reporter’s last word.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, Pencroff,” answered Smith. “No he is not dead; his pulse still beats; he has even uttered a groan. For his sake, now, you must be calm. We have need of all our self-possession; you must not be the means of our losing it, my friend.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff was silent, but large tears rolled down his cheeks.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Meanwhile, Spilett tried to recall to memory the proper treatment of the case before him. There seemed no doubt that the ball had entered in front and gone out by the back; but what injuries had it done by the way? Had it reached any vital spot? This was a question which even a professional surgeon could not have answered at once.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There was something, however, which Spilett knew must be done, and that was to keep down the inflammation, and to fight against the fever which ensues upon a wound. The wound must be dressed without delay. It was not necessary to bring on a fresh flow of blood by the use of tepid water and compresses, for Herbert was already too weak. The wounds, therefore, were bathed with cold water.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Herbert was placed upon his left side and held in that position.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“He must not be moved,” said Spilett; “he is in the position most favorable to an easy suppuration, and absolute repose is necessary.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Cannot we take him to Granite House?” asked Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, Pencroff,” said the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Spilett was examining the boy’s wounds again with close attention. Herbert was so frightfully pale that he became alarmed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Cyrus,” said he, “I am no doctor. I am in a terrible strait; you must help me with your advice and assistance.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Calm yourself, my friend,” answered the engineer, pressing his hand. “Try to judge coolly. Think only of saving Herbert.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Spilett’s self-possession, which in a moment of discouragement his keen sense of responsibility had caused him to lose, returned again at these words. He seated himself upon the bed; Smith remained standing, Pencroff had torn up his shirt and began mechanically to make lint.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Spilett explained that the first thing to do was to check the hemorrhage, but not to close the wounds or bring on immediate cicatrization—for there had been internal perforation, and they must not let the suppurated matter collect within. It was decided therefore to dress the two wounds, but not to press them together. The colonists possessed a most powerful agent for quelling inflamation, and one which nature supplies in the greatest abundance; to-wit, cold water, which is now used by all doctors. It has, moreover, the advantage of allowing the wound perfect rest, and dispensing with the frequent dressing, which by exposing the wound to the air in the early stages, is so often attended with lamentable results.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Thus did Smith and Spilett reason, with clear, native good sense, and acted as the best surgeon would have done. The wounds were bandaged with linen and constantly soaked with fresh water. The sailor had lighted a fire in the chimney, and the house fortunately contained all the necessaries of life. They had maple-sugar and the medicinal plants which the boy had gathered on the shores of Lake Grant. From these they made a refreshing drink for the sick boy. His fever was very high, and he lay all that day and night without a sign of consciousness. His life was hanging on a thread.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the next day, November 12, they began to have some hopes of his recovery. His consciousness returned, he opened his eyes and recognized them all. He even said two or three words, and wanted to know what had happened. Spilett told him, and begged him to keep perfectly quiet; that his life was not in danger, and his wounds would heal in a few days. Herbert suffered very little, for the inflammation was successfully kept down by the plentiful use of cold water. A regular suppuration had set in, the fever did not increase, and they began to hope that this terrible accident would not end in a worse catastrophe.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff took heart again; he was the best of nurses, like a Sister of Charity, or a tender mother watching over her child. Herbert had fallen into another stupor, but this time the sleep appeared more natural.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Tell me again that you have hope, Mr. Spilett,” said Pencroff; “tell me again that you will save my boy!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We shall save him,” said the reporter. “The wound is a serious one, and perhaps the ball has touched the lung; but a wound in that organ is not mortal.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“May God grant it!” answered the sailor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As may be imagined, the care of Herbert had occupied all their time and thoughts for the first twenty-four hours at the corral. They had not considered the urgent danger of a return of the convicts, nor taken any precautions for the future. But on this day while Pencroff was watching over the invalid, Smith and the reporter took counsel together as to their plans.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They first searched the corral. There was no trace of Ayrton, and it seemed probable that he had resisted his former companions, and fallen by their hands. The corral had not been pillaged, and as its gates had remained shut, the domestic animals had not been able to wander away into the woods. They could see no traces of the pirates either in the dwelling or the palisade. The only thing gone was the stock of ammunition.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The poor fellow was taken by surprise,” said Smith, “and as he was a man to show fight, no doubt they made an end of him.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes,” replied the reporter, “and then, no doubt, they took possession here, where they found everything in great plenty, and took to flight only when they saw us coming.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We must beat the woods,” said the engineer, and rid the island of these wretches. But we will have to wait some time in the corral, till the day comes when we can safely carry Herbert to Granite House.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But Neb?” asked the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Neb’s safe enough.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Suppose he becomes anxious and risks coming here?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“He must not come,” said Smith sharply. “He would be murdered on the way!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It’s very likely he will try.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ah! if the telegraph was only in working order, we could warn him! But now it’s impossible. We can’t leave Pencroff and Herbert here alone. Well, I’ll go by myself to Granite House!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, no, Cyrus,” said the reporter, “you must not expose yourself. These wretches are watching the corral from their ambush, and there would be two mishaps instead of one!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But Neb has been without news of us for twenty-four hours,” repeated the engineer. “He will want to come.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">While he reflected, his gaze fell upon Top, who, by running to and fro, seemed to say, “Have you forgotten me?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Top!” cried Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The dog sprang up at this master’s call.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, Top shall go!” cried the reporter, who understood in a flash. Top will make his way where we could not pass, will take our message and bring us back an answer.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Quick!” said Smith, “quick!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Spilett tore out a page of his note-book and wrote these lines:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Herbert wounded. We are at the corral. Be on your guard. Do not leave Granite House. Have the convicts shown themselves near you? Answer by Top!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">This laconic note was folded and tied in a conspicuous way to Top’s collar.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Top, my dog,” said the engineer, caressing the animal, “Neb, Top, Neb! Away! away!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Top sprang high at the words. He understood what was wanted, and the road was familiar to him. The engineer went to the door of the corral and opened one of the leaves.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Neb, Top, Neb!” he cried again, pointing towards Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Top rushed out and disappeared almost instantly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“He’ll get there!” said the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, and come back, the faithful brute!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What time is it?” asked Spilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ten o’clock.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“In an hour he may be here. We will watch for him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The door of the corral was closed again. The engineer and the reporter re-entered the house. Herbert lay in a profound sleep. Pencroff kept his compresses constantly wet with cold water. Spilett, seeing that just then there was nothing else to do, set to work to prepare some food, all the time keeping his eye on that part of the inclosure which backed up against the spur, from which an attack might be made.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists awaited Top’s return with much anxiety. A little before 11 o’clock Smith andSpilett stood with their carbines behind the door, ready to open it at the dog’s first bark. They knew that if Top got safely to Granite House, Neb would send him back at once.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They had waited about ten minutes, when they heard a loud report, followed instantly by continuous barking. The engineer opened the door, and, seeing smoke still curling up among the trees a hundred paces off, he fired in that direction. Just then Top bounded into the corral, whose door was quickly shut.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Top, Top!” cried the engineer, caressing the dog’s large, noble head. A note was fastened to his collar, containing these words in Neb’s sprawling handwriting:——</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No pirates near Granite House. I will not stir. Poor Mr. Herbert!”</p>
<p class="calibre3"><a id="L"></a></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00065" class="calibre2">CHAPTER L.</h4>
<p class="calibre3">THE CONVICTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE CORRAL—PROVISIONAL OCCUPATION—CONTINUATION OF HERBERT’S TREATMENT—PENCROFF’S JUBILATION—REVIEW OF THE PAST—FUTURE PROSPECTS—SMITH’S IDEAS.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So, then, the convicts were close by, watching the corral, and waiting to kill the colonists one after another. They must be attacked like wild beasts, but with the greatest precaution, for the wretches had the advantage of position, seeing and not being seen, able to make a sudden attack, yet not themselves to be surprised.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So Smith made his arrangements to live at the corral, which was fully provisioned. Ayrton’s house was furnished with all the necessaries of life, and the convicts, frightened away by the colonists’ arrival, had not had time to pillage. It was most likely, as Spilett suggested, that the course of events had been this:—The convicts had followed the southern coast, and after getting over into Serpentine Peninsula, and being in no humor to risk themselves in the woods of the Far West, they had reached the month of Fall River. Then, walking up the right bank of the stream, they had come to the spur of Mount Franklin; here was their most natural place of refuge. And they had soon discovered the corral. They had probably installed themselves there, had been surprised by Ayrton, had overcome the unfortunate man, and—the rest was easily divined!</p>
<p class="calibre3">Meanwhile the convicts, reduced to five, but well armed, were prowling in the woods, and to pursue them was to be exposed to their fire without the power either of avoiding or of anticipating them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“There is nothing else to do but wait,” repeated Smith. “When Herbert is well again, we will beat the island, and have a shot at these rascals; while at the same time——”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We search for our mysterious protector,” added Spilett, finishing the sentence. “Ah! we must confess, dear Cyrus, that, for once, his protection has failed us.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We don’t know about that,” answered the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What do you mean?” asked the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We are not at the end of our troubles, my dear Spilett, and his powerful interference may still be exercised. But now we must think of Herbert.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Several days passed, and the poor boy’s condition was happily no worse; and to gain time was a great thing. The cold water, always kept at the proper temperature, had absolutely prevented the inflammation of the wounds. Nay, it seemed to the reporter that this water, which contained a little sulphur, due to the neighborhood of the volcano, had a direct tendency towards cicatrization. The suppuration was much less copious, and, thanks to excellent nursing, Herbert had returned to consciousness, and his fever had abated. He was, moreover, strictly dieted, and, of course, was very weak; but he had plenty of broths and gruels, and absolute rest was doing him great good.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith, Spilett, and Pencroff had become very skilful in tending him. All the linen in the house had been sacrificed. The wounded parts, covered with lint and compresses, were subjected to just enough pressure to cicatrize them without bringing on a reaction of inflammation. The reporter dressed the wounds with the greatest care, repeating to his companions the medical axiom that good dressing is as rare as a good operation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At the end of ten days, by the 22d of November, Herbert was decidedly better. He had begun to take some nourishment. The color came back to his cheeks, and he smiled at his nurse. He talked a little, in spite of Pencroff, who chattered away all the time to keep the boy from saying a word, and told the most remarkable stories. Herbert inquired about Ayrton, and was surprised not to see him at the bedside; but the sailor, who would not distress his patient, answered merely that Ayrton had gone to be with Neb at Granite House in case the convicts attacked it. “Nice fellows they are,” said he. “To think that Mr. Smith wanted to appeal to their feelings! I’ll send them my compliments in a good heavy bullet!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And nobody has seen them?” asked Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, my boy,” answered the sailor, “but we will find them, and when you are well we shall see whether these cowards, who strike from behind, will dare to meet us face to face.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I am still very weak, dear Pencroff.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Oh! your strength will come back little by little. What’s a ball through the chest? Nothing to speak of. I have seen several of them, and feel no worse for it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">In fine, things were growing better, and it no unlucky complication occurred, Herbert’s cure might be regarded as certain. But what would have been the colonists’ situation if the ball had remained in his body, if his arm or leg had had to be amputated? They could not think of it without a shudder.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It seemed to Smith that he and his companions, until now so fortunate, had entered upon an ill-omened time. For the two and a half years which had elapsed since their escape from Richmond they had succeeded in everything. But now luck seemed to be turning against them. Ayrton, doubtless, was dead, and Herbert severely wounded; and that strange but powerful intervention, which had done them such mighty services, seemed now to be withdrawn. Had the mysterious being abandoned the island, or himself been overcome?</p>
<p class="calibre3">They could give no answer to these questions; but though they talked together about them, they were not men to despair. They looked the situation in the face; they analyzed the chances; they prepared themselves for every contingency; they stood firm and undaunted before the future; and if adversity should continue to oppress them, she would find them men prepared to do their utmost.</p>
<p class="calibre3"><a id="LI"></a></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00066" class="calibre2">CHAPTER LI.</h4>
<p class="calibre3">NO NEWS OF NEB—A PROPOSAL FROM PENCROFF AND SPILETT—THE REPORTER’S SORTIES—A FRAGMENT OF CLOTH—A MESSAGE—HURRIED DEPARTURE—ARRIVAL AT PROSPECT PLATEAU.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Herbert’s convalescence progressed steadily. Only one thing was left to wish for, to wit, that he would get well enough to be taken to Granite House. However well arranged and provisioned might be the dwelling in the corral, there was nothing like the solid comfort of their abode in the rock. Besides, they were not safe here, and, in spite of their watchfulness, they were always in dread of a shot from the woods. Whereas there in the midst of that unassailable and inaccessible mass of rock there would be nothing to fear. They waited, therefore, with impatience for the moment when Herbert could be carried, without danger to his wound, across the difficult route through Jacamar Woods.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Though without news of Neb, they had no fear for him. The brave negro, occupying a position of such strength, would not let himself be surprised. Top had not been sent back to him, for it seemed useless to expose the faithful dog to some shot which might deprive the colonists of their most useful helper. The engineer regretted to see his forces divided, and thus to play into the hands of the pirates. Since Ayrton’s disappearance, they were only four against five, for Herbert could not be counted. The poor boy knew and lamented the danger of which he was the cause.</p>
<p class="calibre3">One day, November 29, when he was asleep, they discussed their plans of action against the convicts.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“My friends,” said the reporter, after they had talked over the impossibility of communicating with Neb, “I agree with you that to risk ourselves on the path leading from the corral would be a useless exposure. But why should we not beat the woods for these wretches?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That’s what I was thinking,” replied Pencroff. “We’re not afraid of a bullet, and for my part, if Mr. Smith approves, I am ready to take to the woods. Surely one man is as good as another!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But is he as good as five?” asked the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I will go with Pencroff,’ answered the reporter, “and the two of us, well armed, and Top with us—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“My dear Spilett, and you, Pencroff, let us discuss the matter coolly. If the convicts were in hiding in some place known to us, from which we could drive them by an attack, it would be a different affair. But have we not every reason to fear that they will get the first shot?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, sir,” cried Pencroff, “a bullet doesn’t always hit its mark!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That which pierced Herbert did not go astray,” answered the engineer. “Besides, remember that if you both leave the corral, I shall be left alone to defend it. Can you answer that the convicts will not see you go off, that they will not wait till you are deep in the woods, and then make their attack in your absence upon a man and a sick boy?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">There was nothing to say in answer to this reasoning, which went home to the minds of all.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“If only Ayrton was yet one of the party!” said Spilett. “Poor fellow! his return to a life with his kind was not for long!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“If he is dead!” added Pencroff, in a peculiar tone.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Have you any hope that those rascals have spared him, Pencroff?” asked Spilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, if their interest led them to do so.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What! do you suppose that Ayrton, among his former companions in guilt, would forget all he owed to us—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Nobody can tell,” answered the sailor, with some hesitation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Pencroff,” said Smith, laying his hand on the sailor’s arm, “that was an unworthy thought. I will guarantee Ayrton’s fidelity!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And I too,” added the reporter, decidedly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, yes, Mr. Smith, I am wrong,” answered Pencroff. “But really I am a little out of my mind. This imprisonment in the corral is driving me to distraction.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Be patient, Pencroff,” answered the engineer. “How soon, my dear Spilett, do you suppose Herbert can be carried to Granite House?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That is hard to say, Cyrus,” answered the reporter, “for a little imprudence might be fatal. But if he goes on as well as he is doing now for another week, why then we will see.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">At that season the spring was two months advanced. The weather was good, and the heat began to be oppressive. The woods were in fall leaf, and it was almost time to reap the accustomed harvest. It can easily be understood how this siege in the corral upset the plans of the colonists.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Once or twice the reporter risked himself outside, and walked around the palisade. Top was with him, and his carbine was loaded.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He met no one and saw nothing suspicious. Top would have warned him of any danger, and so long as the dog did not bark, there was nothing to fear.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But on his second sortie, on the 27th of November, Spilett, who had ventured into the woods for a quarter of a mile to the south of the mountain, noticed that Top smelt something. The dog’s motions were no longer careless; he ran to and fro, ferreting about in the grass and thistles, as if his keen nose had put him on the track of an enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Spilett followed the dog, encouraging and exciting him by his voice; his eye on the alert, his carbine on his shoulder, and availing himself of the shelter of the trees. It was not likely that Top had recognized the presence of a man, for in that case he would have announced it by a half-stifled but angry bark. Since not even a growl was to be heard, the danger was evidently neither near nor approaching.</p>
<p class="calibre3">About five minutes had passed in this way, Top ferreting about and the reporter cautiously following him, when the dog suddenly rushed towards a thicket and tore from it a strip of cloth. It was a piece from a garment, dirty and torn. Spilett went back with it to the corral. There the colonists examined it and recognized it as a piece of Ayrton’s waistcoat, which was made of the felt prepared only in the workshop at Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You see, Pencroff,” observed Smith, “Ayrton resisted manfully, and the convicts dragged him off in spite of his efforts. Do you still doubt his good faith?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, Mr. Smith,” replied the sailor; “I have long ago given up that momentary suspicion. But I think we may draw one conclusion from this fact.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What is that?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That Ayrton was not killed at the corral. They must have dragged him out alive, and perhaps he is still alive.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It may be so,” said the engineer, thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The most impatient of them all to get back to Granite House was Herbert. He knew how necessary it was for them all to be there, and felt that it was he who was keeping them at the corral. The one thought which had taken possession of his mind was to leave the corral, and to leave it as soon as possible. He believed that he could bear the journey to Granite House. He was sure that his strength would come back to him sooner in his own room, with the sight and the smell of the sea.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was now November 29. The colonists were talking together in Herbert’s room, about 7 o’clock in the morning, when they heard Top barking loudly. They seized their guns, always loaded and cocked, and went out of the house.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Top ran to the bottom of the palisade, jumping and barking with joy.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Some one is coming!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And not an enemy.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Neb, perhaps?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Or Ayrton?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">These words had scarcely been exchanged between the engineer and his comrade, when something leaped the palisade and fell on the ground inside. It was Jup. Master Jup himself, who was frantically welcomed by Top.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Neb has sent him!” said the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then he must have some note on him,” said the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff rushed to the orang. Neb could not have chosen a better messenger, who could get through obstacles which none of the others could have surmounted. Smith was right. Around Jup’s neck was hung a little bag, and in it was a note in Neb’s handwriting. The dismay of the colonists may be imagined when they read these words:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“FRIDAY, 6 A. M.”—The convicts are on the plateau. NEB.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">They looked at each other without saying a word, then walked back to the house. What was there to do? The convicts on Prospect Plateau meant disaster, devastation and ruin! Herbert knew at once from their faces that the situation had become grave, and when he saw Jup, he had no more doubt that misfortune was threatening Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Mr. Smith,” said he, “I want to go. I can bear the journey. I want to start.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Spilett came up to Herbert and looked at him intently.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let us start then,” said he.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The question of Herbert’s transportation was quickly decided. A litter would be the most comfortable way of travelling, but it would necessitate two porters; that is, two guns would be subtracted from their means of defense. On the other hand, by placing the mattresses on which Herbert lay in the wagon, so as to deaden the motion, and by walking carefully they could escape jolting him, and would leave their arms free.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The wagon was brought out and the onagga harnessed to it; Smith and the reporter lifted the mattresses with Herbert on them, and laid them in the bottom of the wagon between the rails. The weather was fine, and the sun shone brightly between the trees.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Are the arms ready?” asked Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They were. The engineer and Pencroff, each armed with a double-barrelled gun, and Spilett with his carbine, stood ready to set out.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“How do you feel, Herbert?” asked the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Don’t be troubled, Mr. Smith,” answered the boy, “I shall not die on the way.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">They could see that the poor fellow was making a tremendous effort. The engineer felt a grievous pang. He hesitated to give the signal for departure. But to stay would have thrown Herbert into despair.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let us start,” said Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The corral door was opened. Jup and Top, who knew how to be quiet on emergency, rushed on ahead. The wagon went out, the gate was shut, and the onagga, under Pencroff’s guidance, walked on with a slow pace.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was necessary, on account of the wagon, to keep to the direct road from the corral to Granite House, although it was known to the convicts. Smith and Spilett walked on either side of the chariot, ready to meet any attack. Still it was not likely that the convicts had yet abandoned Prospect Plateau. Neb’s note had evidently been sent as soon as they made their appearance. Now this note was dated at 6 o’clock in the morning, and the active orang, who was accustomed to the way, would have got over the five miles from Granite House in three-quarters of an hour. Probably they would have no danger to fear till they approached Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But they kept on the alert. Top and Jup, the latter armed with his stick, sometimes in front, and sometimes beating the woods on either side, gave no signal of approaching danger. The wagon moved on slowly, and an hour after leaving the corral, they had passed over four of the five miles without any incident.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They drew near the plateau another mile, and they saw the causeway over Glycerine Creek. At last, through an opening in the wood, they saw the horizon of the sea. But the wagon went on slowly, and none of its defenders could leave it for a moment. Just then Pencroff stopped the wagon and cried, fiercely,</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ah, the wretches!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">And he pointed to a thick smoke which curled up from the mill, the stables, and the buildings of the poultry-yard. In the midst of this smoke a man was running about. It was Neb.</p>
<p class="calibre3">His companions uttered a cry. He heard them and rushed to meet them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The convicts had abandoned the plateau half an hour before, after having done all the mischief they could.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And Mr. Herbert?” cried Neb.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Spilett went back to the wagon. Herbert had fainted.</p>

<p class="calibre3">HERBERT CARRIED TO GRANITE HOUSE—NEB RELATES WHAT HAD HAPPENED—VISIT OF SMITH TO THE PLATEAU—RUIN AND DEVASTATION—THE COLONISTS HELPLESS—WILLOW BARK—A MORTAL FEVER—TOP BARKS AGAIN.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The convicts, the dangers threatening Granite House, the ruin on the plateau, none of these were thought of, in the present condition of Herbert. It was impossible to say whether the transportation had occasioned some internal rupture, but his companions were almost hopeless.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The wagon had been taken to the bend of the river, and there the mattress, on which lay the unconscious lad, was placed on a litter of branches, and within a few minutes Herbert was lying on his bed in Granite House. He smiled for a moment on finding himself again in his chamber, and a few words escaped feebly from his lips. Spilett looked at his wounds, fearing that they might have opened, but the cicatrices were unbroken. What, then, was the cause of this prostration, or why had his condition grown worse?</p>
<p class="calibre3">Soon the lad fell into a feverish sleep, and the reporter and Pencroff watched beside him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Meantime, Smith told Neb of all that had happened at the corral, and Neb told his master of what had passed at the plateau.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was not until the previous night that the convicts had shown themselves beyond the edge of the forest, near Glycerine Creek. Neb, keeping watch near the poultry-yard, had not hesitated to fire at one of them who was crossing the bridge; but he could not say with what result. At least, it did not disperse the band, and Neb had but just time to climb up into Granite House, where he, at least, would be safe.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But what was the next thing to do? How prevent the threatened devastation to the plateau? How could he inform his master? And, moreover, in what situation were the occupants of the corral?</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith and his companions had gone away on the 11th inst., and here it was the 29th. In that time all the information that Neb had received was the disastrous news brought by Top. Ayrton gone, Herbert badly wounded, the engineer, the reporter, and the sailor imprisoned in the corral.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The poor negro asked himself what was to be done. Personally, he had nothing to fear, as the convicts could not get into Granite House. But the works, the fields, all the improvements, were at the mercy of the pirates. Was it not best to let Smith know of the threatened danger?</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then Neb thought of employing Jup on this errand. He knew the intelligence of the orang. Jup knew the word “corral.” It was not yet daylight. The agile brute could slip through the woods unperceived. So the negro wrote a note, which he fastened round Jup’s neck, and taking the monkey to the door and unrolling a long cord, he repeated the words:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Jup! Jup! To the corral! the corral!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The animal understood him, and, seizing the cord, slid down to the ground, and disappeared in the darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You did well, Neb, although In not forewarning us perhaps you would have done better!” said Smith, thinking of Herbert, and how the carrying him back had been attended with such serious results.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Neb finished his recital. The convicts had not shown themselves upon the beach, doubtless fearing the inhabitants of Granite House, whose number they did not know. But the plateau was open and unprotected by Granite House. Here, therefore, they gave loose reins to their instinct of depredation and destruction, and they had left but half-an-hour before the colonists returned.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Neb had rushed from his retreat, and at the risk of being shot, he had climbed to the plateau and had tried to put out the fire which was destroying the inclosure to the poultry-yard. Ho was engaged in this work when the others returned.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Thus the presence of the convicts was a constant menace to the colonists, heretofore so happy, and they might expect the most disastrous results from them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith, accompanied by Neb, went to see for himself, the extent of the injury done. He walked along by the Mercy and up the left bank without seeing any trace of the convicts. It was likely that the latter had either witnessed the return of the colonists, and had gone back to the corral, now undefended, or that they had gone back to their camp to await an occasion to renew the attack.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At present, however, all attempts to rid the island of these pests were subject to the condition of Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The engineer and Neb reached the place. It was a scene of desolation. Fields trampled; the harvest scattered; the stables and other buildings burned; the frightened animals roaming at large over the plateau. The fowls, which had sought refuge on the lake, were returning to their accustomed place on its banks. Everything here would have to be done over again.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The succeeding days were the saddest which the colonists had passed on the island. Herbert became more and more feeble. He was in a sort of stupor, and symptoms of delirium began to manifest themselves. Cooling draughts were all the remedies at the disposition of the colonists. Meantime, the fever became intermittent, and it was necessary to check, it before it developed greater strength.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“To do this,” said Spilett, “we must have a febrifuge.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And we have neither cinchonia nor quinine,” answered the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, but we can make a substitute from the bark of the willow trees at the lake.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let us try it immediately,” replied Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Indeed, willow bark has been partly considered succedaneous to cinchonia, but since they had no means of extracting the salicin, the bark must be used in its natural state.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith, therefore, cut some pieces of bark from a species of black willow, and, reducing them to powder, this powder was given to Herbert the same evening.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The night passed without incident. Herbert was somewhat delirious, but the fever did not manifest itself. Pencroff became more hopeful, but Spilett, who knew that the fever was intermittent, looked forward to the next day with anxiety.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They noticed that during the apyrexy, Herbert seemed completely prostrated, his head heavy, and subject to dizziness. Another alarming symptom was a congestion of the liver, and soon a more marked delirium manifested itself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Spilett was overwhelmed by this new complication. He drew the engineer aside and said to him:——</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is a pernicious fever!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“A pernicious fever!” cried Smith. “You must be mistaken, Spilett. A pernicious fever never declares itself spontaneously; it must have a germ.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I am not mistaken,” replied the reporter. “Herbert may have caught the germ in the marshes. He has already had one attack; if another follows, and we cannot prevent a third—he is lost!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But the willow bark?——”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Is insufficient. And a third attack of pernicious fever, when one cannot break it by means of quinine, is always mortal!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Happily Pencroff had not heard this conversation. It would have driven him wild.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Towards noon of the 7th, the second attack manifested itself. The crisis was terrible. Herbert felt that he was lost! He stretched out his arms towards Smith, towards Spilett, towards Pencroff! He did not want to die! The scene was heartrending, and it became necessary to take Pencroff away.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The attack lasted five hours. It was plain that the lad could not support a third. The night was full of torture. In his delirium, Herbert wrestled with the convicts; he called Ayrton; he supplicated that mysterious being, that protector, who had disappeared but whose image haunted him—then he fell into a profound prostration, and Spilett, more than once, thought the poor boy was dead!</p>
<p class="calibre3">The next day passed with only a continuation of the lad’s feebleness. His emaciated hands clutched the bed clothing. They continued giving him doses of the willow powder, but the reporter anticipated no result from it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“If,” said he, “before to-morrow morning we cannot give him a more powerful febrifuge than this, Herbert will die!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The night came—doubtless the last night for this brave lad, so good, so clever, whom all loved as their own child! The sole remedy against this pernicious fever, the sole specific which could vanquish it, was not to be found on Lincoln Island!</p>
<p class="calibre3">During the night Herbert became frightfully delirious. He recognized no one. It was not even probable that he would live till morning. His strength was exhausted. Towards 3 o’clock he uttered a frightful cry. He was seized by a terrible convulsion. Neb, who was beside him, rushed, frightened, into the adjoining chamber, where his companions were watching.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At the same moment Top gave one of his strange barks.</p>
<p class="calibre3">All returned to the chamber and gathered round the dying lad, who struggled to throw himself from the bed. Spilett, who held his arms, felt his pulse slowly rising.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Five o’clock came. The sun’s rays shone into the chambers of Granite House. A beautiful day, the last on earth for poor Herbert, dawned over Lincoln Island.</p>
<p class="calibre3">A sunbeam crept on to the table beside the bed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Suddenly Pencroff, uttering an exclamation, pointed to something on that table.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was a small oblong box, bearing these words:——</p>
<p class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">Sulphate of quinine.</i></p>
<p class="calibre3"><a id="LIII"></a></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00068" class="calibre2">CHAPTER LIII.</h4>
<p class="calibre3">AN INEXPLICABLE MYSTERY—HERBERT’S CONVALESCENCE—THE UNEXPLORED PARTS OF THE ISLAND—PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE—THE FIRST DAY—NIGHT—SECOND DAY—THE KAURIS—CASSOWARIES—FOOTPRINTS IN THE SAND—ARRIVAL AT REPTILE END.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Spilett took the box and opened it. It contained a white powder, which he tasted. Its extreme bitterness was unmistakable. It was indeed that precious alkaloid, the true anti-periodic.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was necessary to administer it to Herbert without delay. How it came there could be discussed later.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Spilett called for some coffee, and Neb brought a lukewarm infusion, in which the reporter placed eighteen grains of quinine and gave the mixture to Herbert to drink.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There was still time, as the third attack of the fever had not yet manifested itself. And, indeed, it did not return. Moreover, every one became hopeful. The mysterious influence was again about them, and that too in a moment when they had despaired of its aid.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After a few hours, Herbert rested more quietly, and the colonists could talk of the incident. The intervention of this unknown being was more evident than ever, but how had he succeeded in getting in to Granite House during the night? It was perfectly inexplicable, and, indeed, the movements of this “genius of the island” were as mysterious as the genius himself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The quinine was administered to Herbert every three hours, and the next day the lad was certainly better. It is true he was not out of danger, since these fevers are often followed by dangerous relapses; but, then, here was the specific, and, doubtless, not far off, the one who had brought it. In two days more Herbert became convalescent. He was still feeble, but there had been no relapse, and he cheerfully submitted to the rigorous diet imposed upon, him. He was so anxious to get well.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff was beside himself with joy. After the critical period had been safely passed he seized the reporter in his arms, and called him nothing but Doctor Spilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But the true physician was still to be found.</p>
<p class="calibre3">““We will find him!” said the sailor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The year 1867, during which the colonists had been so hardly beset, came to an end, and the new year began with superb weather. A fine warmth, a tropical temperature, moderated by the sea breeze. Herbert’s bed was drawn close to the window, where he could inhale long draughts of the salt, salubrious air. His appetite began to return, and what tempting savory morsels Neb prepared for him!</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It made one wish to be ill,” said Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">During this time the convicts had not shown themselves, neither was there any news of Ayrton. The engineer and Herbert still hoped to get him back, but the others thought that the unhappy man had succumbed. In a month’s time, when the lad should have regained his strength, the important search would be undertaken, and all these questions set at rest.</p>
<p class="calibre3">During January the work on the plateau consisted simply in collecting the grain and vegetables undestroyed in the work of devastation, and planting some for a late crop during the next season. Smith preferred to wait till the island was rid of the convicts before he repaired the damage to the mill, poultry-yard, and stable.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the latter part of the month Herbert began to take some exercise. He was eighteen years old, his constitution was splendid, and from this moment the improvement in his condition was visible daily.</p>
<p class="calibre3">By the end of the month he walked on the shore and over the plateau, and strengthened himself with sea-baths. Smith felt that the day for the exploration could be set, and the 15th of February was chosen. The nights at this season were very clear, and would, therefore, be advantageous to the search.</p>
