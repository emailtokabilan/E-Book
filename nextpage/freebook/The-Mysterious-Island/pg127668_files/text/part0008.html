<p class="calibre3">“How beautiful it is!” exclaimed Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, she is a pretty creature,” responded Pencroff. “I love her as a mother. She received us poor and needy, and what has she denied to these five children who tumbled upon her out of the sky?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Nothing, captain, nothing,” answered Neb. And the two honest fellows gave three hearty cheers in honor of their island.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Meantime, Spilett, seated by the mast, sketched the panorama before him, while Smith looked on in silence.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What do you say of our boat, now, sir?” demanded Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It acts very well,” replied the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Good. And now don’t you think it could undertake a voyage of some length?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Where, Pencroff?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“To Tabor Island, for instance.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“My friend,” replied the engineer, “I believe that in a case of necessity there need be no hesitancy in trusting to the Good Luck even for a longer journey; but, you know, I would be sorry to see you leave for Tabor Island, because nothing obliges you to go.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“One likes to know one’s neighbors,” answered Pencroff, whose mind was made up. “Tabor Island is our neighbor, and is all alone. Politeness requires that at least we make her a visit.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The mischief!” exclaimed Spilett, “our friend Pencroff is a stickler for propriety.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I am not a stickler at all,” retorted the sailor, who was a little vexed by the engineer’s opposition.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Remember, Pencroff,” said Smith, “that you could not go the island alone.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“One other would be all I would want.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Supposing so,” replied the engineer, “would you risk depriving our colony of five, of two of its colonists?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“There are six,” rejoined Pencroff. “You forget Jup.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“There are seven,” added Neb. “Top is as good as another.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“There is no risk in it, Mr. Smith,” said Pencroff again.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Possibly not, Pencroff; but, I repeat, that it is exposing oneself without necessity.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The obstinate sailor did not answer, but let the conversation drop for the present. He little thought that an incident was about to aid him, and change to a work of humanity what had been merely a caprice open to discussion.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The Good Luck, after having stood out to sea, was returning towards the coast and making for Balloon Harbor, as it was important to locate the channel-way between the shoals and reefs so as to buoy them, for this little inlet was to be resting place of the sloop.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They were half a mile off shore, beating up to windward and moving somewhat slowly, as the boat was under the lee of the land. The sea was as smooth as glass. Herbert was standing in the bows indicating the channel-way. Suddenly he cried:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Luff, Pencroff, luff.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What is it?” cried the sailor, springing to his feet. “A rock?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No—hold on, I cannot see very well—luff again—steady—bear away a little—” and while thus speaking, the lad lay down along the deck, plunged his arm quickly into the water, and then rising up again with something in his hand, exclaimed:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is a bottle!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith took it, and without saying a word, withdrew the cork and took out a wet paper, on which was written these words:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“A shipwrecked man—Tabor Island:—l53° W. lon.—37° 11’ S. lat.”</p>
<p class="calibre3"><a id="XXXV"></a></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00049" class="calibre2">CHAPTER XXXV.</h4>
<p class="calibre3">DEPARTURE DECIDED UPON—PREPARATIONS—THE THREE PASSENGERS—THE FIRST NIGHT—THE SECOND NIGHT—TABOR ISLAND—SEARCH ON THE SHORE—SEARCH IN THE WOODS—NO ONE—ANIMALS—PLANTS—A HOUSE—DESERTED.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Some one shipwrecked!” cried Pencroff, “abandoned some hundred miles from us upon Tabor Island! Oh! Mr. Smith, you will no longer oppose my project!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, Pencroff, and you must leave as soon as possible.”.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“To-morrow?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“To-morrow.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The engineer held the paper which he had taken from the bottle in his hand. He considered for a few moments, and then spoke:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“From this paper, my friends,” said he, “and from the manner in which it is worded, we must conclude that, in the first place, the person cast away upon Tabor Island is a man well informed, since he gives the latitude and longitude of his island exactly; secondly, that he is English or American, since the paper is written in English.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That is a logical conclusion,” answered Spilett, “and the presence of this person explains the arrival of the box on our coast. There has been a shipwreck, since some one has been shipwrecked. And he is fortunate in that Pencroff had the idea of building this boat and even of trying it to-day, for in twenty-four hours the bottle would have been broken on the rocks.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Indeed,!’ said Herbert, “it is a happy chance that the Good Luck passed by the very spot where this bottle was floating.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Don’t it seem to you odd?” asked Smith of Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It seems fortunate, that’s all,” replied the sailor. “Do you see anything extraordinary in it, sir? This bottle must have gone somewhere, and why not here as well as anywhere else?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Perhaps you are right, Pencroff,” responded the engineer, “and nevertheless—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But,” interrupted Herbert, “nothing proves that this bottle has floated in the water for a long time.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Nothing,” responded Spilett, “and moreover the paper seems to have been recently written. What do you think, Cyrus?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is hard to decide.” answered Smith..</p>
<p class="calibre3">Meanwhile Pencroff had not been idle. He had gone about, and the Good Luck, with a free wind, all her sails drawing, was speeding toward Claw Cape. Each one thought of the castaway on Tabor Island. Was there still time to save him? This was a great event in the lives of the colonists. They too were but castaways, but it was not probable that another had been as favored as they had been, and it was their duty to hasten at once to this one’s relief. By 2 o’clock Claw Cape was doubled, and the Good Luck anchored at the mouth of the Mercy.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That evening all the details of the expedition were arranged. It was agreed that Herbert and Pencroff, who understood the management of a boat, were to undertake the voyage alone. By leaving the next day, the 11th of October, they would reach the island, supposing the wind continued, in forty-eight hours. Allowing for one day there, and three or four days to return in, they could calculate on being at Lincoln Island again on the 17th. The weather was good, the barometer rose steadily, the wind seemed as if it would continue, everything favored these brave men, who were going so far to do a humane act.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Thus, Smith, Neb, and Spilett was to remain at Granite House; but at the last moment, the latter, remembering his duty as reporter to the New York <i class="calibre5">Herald</i>, having declared that he would swim rather than lose such an opportunity, was allowed to take part in the voyage.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The evening was employed in putting bedding, arms, munitions, provisions, etc., on board, and the next morning, by 5 o’clock, the good-byes were spoken, and Pencroff, hoisting the sails, headed for Claw Cape, which had to be doubled before taking the route to the southeast. The Good Luck was already a quarter of a mile from shore when her passengers saw upon the heights of Granite House two men signalling farewells. They were Smith and Neb, from whom they were separating for the first time in fifteen months.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff, Herbert, and the reporter returned the signal, and soon Granite House disappeared behind the rocks of the Cape.</p>
<p class="calibre3">During the morning, the Good Luck remained in view of the southern coast of the island, which appeared like a green clump of trees, above which rose Mount Franklin. The heights, lessened by distance, gave it an appearance little calculated to attract ships on its coasts. At 1 o’clock Reptile Promontory was passed ten miles distant. It was therefore impossible to distinguish the western coast, which extended to the spurs of the mountain, and three hours later, Lincoln Island had disappeared behind the horizon.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The Good Luck behaved admirably. She rode lightly over the seas and sailed rapidly. Pencroff had set his topsail, and with a fair wind he followed a straight course by the compass. Occasionally Herbert took the tiller, and the hand of the young lad was so sure, that the sailor had nothing to correct.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Spilett chatted with one and the other, and lent a hand when necessary in manœuvring the sloop. Captain Pencroff was perfectly satisfied with his crew, and was constantly promising them an extra allowance of grog.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the evening the slender crescent of the moon glimmered in the twilight. The night came on dark but starlit, with the promise of a fine day on the morrow. Pencroff thought it prudent to take in the topsail, which was perhaps an excess of caution in so still a night, but he was a careful sailor, and was not to be blamed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The reporter slept during half the night, Herbert and Pencroff taking two-hour turns at the helm. The sailor had as much confidence in his pupil as he had in himself, and his trust was justified by the coolness and judgment of the lad. Pencroff set the course as a captain to his helmsman, and Herbert did not allow the Good Luck to deviate a point from her direction.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The night and the next day passed quietly and safely. The Good Luck held her southeast course, and, unless she was drawn aside by some unknown current, she would make Tabor Island exactly. The sea was completely deserted, save that sometimes an albatross or frigate-bird passed within gun-shot distance.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And yet,” said Herbert, “this is the season when the whalers usually come towards the southern part of the Pacific. I don’t believe that there is a sea more deserted than this.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is not altogether deserted,” responded Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What do you mean?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why we are here. Do you take us for porpoises or our sloop for driftwood?” And Pencroff laughed at his pleasantry.</p>
<p class="calibre3">By evening they calculated the distance traversed at 130 miles, or three and a third miles an hour. The breeze was dying away, but they had reason to hope, supposing their course to have been correct, that they would sight Tabor Island at daylight.</p>
<p class="calibre3">No one of the three slept during this night. While waiting for morning they experienced the liveliest emotions. There was so much uncertainty in their enterprise. Were they near the island? Was the shipwrecked man still there? Who was he? Might not his presence disturb the unity of the colony? Would he, indeed, consent to exchange one prison for another? All these questions, which would doubtless be answered the next day, kept them alert, and at the earliest dawn they began to scan the western horizon.</p>
<p class="calibre3">What was the joy of the little crew when towards 6 o’clock Pencroff shouted—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Land!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">In a few hours they would be upon its shore.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The island was a low coast, raised but a little above the waves, not more than fifteen miles away. The sloop, which had been heading south of it, was put about, and, as the sun rose, a few elevations became visible here and there.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is not as large as Lincoln Island,” said Herbert, “and probably owes its origin to like submarine convulsions.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">By 11 o’clock the Good Luck was only two miles distant from shore, and Pencroff, while seeking some place to land, sailed with extreme caution through these unknown waters. They could see the whole extent of this island, on which were visible groups of gum and other large trees of the same species as those on Lincoln Island. But, it was astonishing, that no rising smoke indicated that the place was inhabited, nor was any signal visible upon the shore. Nevertheless the paper had been precise: it stated that there was a shipwrecked man here; and he should have been upon the watch.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Meanwhile the Good Luck went in through the tortuous passages between the reefs, Herbert steering, and the sailor stationed forward, keeping a sharp lookout, with the halliards in his hand, ready to run down the sail. Spilett, with the spy-glass, examined all the shore without perceiving anything. By noon the sloop touched the beach, the anchor was let go, the sails furled, and the crew stepped on shore.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There could be no doubt that that was Tabor Island, since the most recent maps gave no other land in all this part of the Pacific.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After having securely moored the sloop, Pencroff and his companion, well armed, ascended the coast towards a round hill, some 250 feet high, which was distant about half a mile, from the summit of which they expected to have a good view of the island.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The explorers followed the edge of grassy plain which ended at the foot of the hill. Rock-pigeons and sea-swallows circled about them, and in the woods bordering the plain to the left they heard rustlings in the bushes and saw movements in the grass indicating the presence of very timid animals, but nothing, so far, indicated that the island was inhabited.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Having reached the hill the party soon climbed to its summit, and their gaze traversed the whole horizon. They were certainly upon an island, not more than six miles in circumference, in shape a long oval, and but little broken by inlets or promontories. All around it, the sea, absolutely deserted, stretched away to the horizon.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This islet differed greatly from Lincoln Island in that it was covered over its entire surface with woods, and the uniform mass of verdure clothed two or three less elevated hills. Obliquely to the oval of the island a small stream crossed a large grassy plain and emptied into the sea on the western side by a narrowed mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The place is small,” said Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes,” replied the sailor. “It would have been too small for us.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And,” added the reporter, “it seems uninhabited.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Nevertheless,” said Pencroff, “let us go down and search.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The party returned to the sloop, and they decided to walk round the entire island before venturing into its interior, so that no place could escape their investigation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The shore was easily followed, and the explorers proceeded towards the south, starting up flocks of aquatic birds and numbers of seals, which latter threw themselves into the sea as soon as they caught sight of the party.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Those beasts are not looking on man for the first time. They fear what they know,” said the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">An hour after their departure the three had reached the southern point of the islet, which terminated in a sharp cape, and they turned towards the north, following the western shore, which was sandy, like the other, and bounded by a thick wood.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In four hours after they had set out the party had made the circuit of the island, without having seen any trace of a habitation, and not even a footprint. It was most extraordinary, to say the least, and it seemed necessary to believe that the place was not and had not been inhabited. Perhaps, after all, the paper had been in the water for many months, or even years, and it was possible, in that case, that the shipwrecked one had been rescued or that he had died from suffering.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The little party, discussing all sorts of possibilities, made a hasty dinner on board the sloop, and at 5 o’clock started to explore the woods.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Numerous animals fled before their approach, principally, indeed solely, goats and pigs, which it was easy to see were of European origin. Doubtless some whaler had left them here, and they had rapidly multiplied. Herbert made up his mind to catch two or three pairs to take back to Lincoln Island.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There was no longer any doubt that the island had previously been visited. This was the more evident as in passing through the forest they saw the traces of pathways, and the trunks of trees felled by the hatchet, and all about, marks of human handiwork; but these trees had been felled years before; the hatchet marks were velvetted with moss, and the pathways were so overgrown with grass that it was difficult to discover them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But,” observed Spilett, “this proves that men not only landed here, but that they lived here. Now who and how many were these men, and how many remain?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The paper speaks of but one,” replied Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well,” said Pencroff, “if he is still here we cannot help finding him.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The exploration was continued, following diagonally across the island, and by this means the sailor and his companions reached the little stream which flowed towards the sea.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If animals of European origin, if works of human hands proved conclusively that man had once been here, many specimens of the vegetable kingdom also evidenced the fact. In certain clear places it was plain that kitchen vegetables had formerly been planted. And Herbert was overjoyed when he discovered potatoes, succory, sorrel, carrots, cabbage, and turnips, the seeds of which would enrich the garden at Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Indeed,” exclaimed Pencroff, “this will rejoice Neb. Even if we don’t find the man, our voyage will not have been useless, and Heaven will have rewarded us.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Doubtless,” replied Spilett, “but from the conditions of these fields, it looks as if the place had not been inhabited for a long time.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“An inhabitant, whoever he was, would not neglect anything so important as this.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, this man has gone. It must be—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That the paper had been written a long time ago?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Undoubtedly.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And that the bottle had been floating in the sea a good while before it arrived at Lincoln Island?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why not?” said Pencroff. “But, see, it is getting dark,” he added, “and I think we had better give over the search.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We will go aboard, and to-morrow we will begin again,” replied the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They were about adopting this counsel, when Herbert, pointing to something dimly visible, through the trees, exclaimed:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“There’s a house!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">All three directed their steps towards the place indicated, and they made out in the twilight that it was built of planks, covered with heavy tarpaulin. The door, half closed, was pushed back by Pencroff, who entered quickly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The place was empty!</p>
<p class="calibre3"><a id="XXXVI"></a></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00050" class="calibre2">CHAPTER XXXVI.</h4>
<p class="calibre3">THE INVENTORY—THE NIGHT—SOME LETTERS—THE SEARCH CONTINUED—PLANTS AND ANIMALS—HERBERT IN DANGER—ABOARD—THE DEPARTURE—BAD WEATHER—A GLIMMER OF INTELLIGENCE —LOST AT SEA—A TIMELY LIGHT.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff, Spilett and Herbert stood silent In darkness. Then the former gave a loud call. There was no answer. He lit a twig, and the light illuminated for a moment a small room, seemingly deserted. At one end was a large chimney, containing some cold cinders and an armful of dry wood. Pencroff threw the lighted twig into it, and the wood caught fire and gave out a bright light.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The sailor and his companions thereupon discovered a bed in disorder, its damp and mildewed covers proving that it had been long unused; in the corner of the fireplace were two rusty kettles and an overturned pot; a clothes-press with some sailors’ clothing, partially moulded; on the table a tin plate, and a Bible, injured by the dampness; in a corner some tools, a shovel, a mattock, a pick, two shot guns, one of which was broken; on a shelf was a barrel full of powder, a barrel of lead, and a number of boxes of caps. All were covered with a thick coating of dust.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“There is no one here,” said the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Not a soul.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“This room has not been occupied in a long time.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Since a very long time.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Mr. Spilett,” said Pencroff, “I think that instead of going on board we had better stay here all night.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You are right, Pencroff, and if the proprietor returns he will not be sorry, perhaps, to find the place occupied.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“He won’t come back, though,” said the sailor, shaking his head.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Do you think he has left the island?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“If he had left the island he would have taken these things with him. You know how much a shipwrecked person would be attached to these objects. No, no,” repeated the sailor, in the tone of a man perfectly convinced; “no, he has not left the island. He is surely here.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Alive?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Alive or dead. But if he is dead he could not have buried himself, I am sure, and we will at least find his remains.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was therefore agreed to pass the night in this house, and a supply of wood in the corner gave them the means of heating it. The door having been closed, the three explorers, seated upon a bench, spoke little, but remained deep in thought. They were in the mood to accept anything that might happen, and they listened eagerly for any sound from without. If the door had suddenly opened and a man had stood before them, they would not have been much surprised, in spite of all the evidence of desolation throughout the house; and their hands were ready to clasp the hands of this man, of this shipwrecked one, of this unknown friend whose friends awaited him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But no sound was heard, the door did not open, and the hours passed by.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The night seemed interminable to the sailor and his companions. Herbert, alone, slept for two hours, as at his age, sleep is a necessity. All were anxious to renew the search of the day before, and to explore the innermost recesses of the islet. Pencroff’s conclusions were certainly just, since the house and its contents had been abandoned. They determined, therefore, to search for the remains of its inhabitant, and to give them Christian burial.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As soon as it was daylight they began to examine the house. It was prettily situated under a small hill, on which grew several fine gum trees. Before it a large space had been cleared, giving a view over the sea. A small lawn, surrounded by a dilapidated fence, extended to the bank of the little stream. The house had evidently been built from planks taken from a ship. It seemed likely that a ship had been thrown upon the island, that all or at least one of the crew had been saved, and that this house had been built from the wreck. This was the more probable, as Spilett, in going round the dwelling, saw on one of the planks these half-effaced letters:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">BR ... TAN ... A.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Britannia,” exclaimed Pencroff, who had been called by the reporter to look at it; “that is a common name among ships, and I cannot say whether it is English or American. However, it don’t matter to what country the man belongs, we will save him, if he is alive. But before we begin our search let us go back to the Good Luck.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff had been seized with a sort of anxiety about his sloop. Supposing the island was inhabited, and some one had taken it—but he shrugged his shoulders at this unlikely thought. Nevertheless the sailor was not unwilling to go on board to breakfast. The route already marked was not more than a mile in length, and they started on their walk, looking carefully about them in the woods and underbrush, through which ran hundreds of pigs and goats.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In twenty minutes the party reached the place where the Good Luck rode quietly at anchor. Pencroff gave a sigh of satisfaction.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After all, this boat was his baby, and it is a father’s right to be often anxious without reason.</p>
<p class="calibre3">All went on board and ate a hearty breakfast, so as not to want anything before a late dinner; then the exploration was renewed, and conducted with the utmost carefulness. As it was likely that the solitary inhabitant of this island was dead, the party sought rather to find his remains than any traces of him living. But during all the morning they were unable to find anything; if he was dead, some animal must have devoured his body.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We will leave to-morrow at daylight,” said Pencroff to his companions, who towards 2 o’clock were resting for a few moments under a group of trees.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I think we need not hesitate to take those things which belonged to him?” queried Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I think not,” answered Spilett; “and these arms and tools will add materially to the stock at Granite House. If I am not mistaken, what is left of the lead and powder is worth a good deal.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And we must not forget to capture a couple of these pigs,” said Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Nor to gather some seed,” added Herbert, “which will give us some of our own vegetables.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Perhaps it would be better to spend another day here, in order to get together everything that we want,” suggested the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, sir;” replied the sailor. “I want to get away to-morrow morning. The wind seems to be shifting to the west, and will be in our favor going back.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then don’t let us lose any time,” said Herbert, rising.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We will not,” replied Pencroff. “Herbert, you get the seed, and Spilett and I will chase the pigs, and although we haven’t Top, I think we will catch some.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Herbert, therefore, followed the path which led to the cultivated part of the island, while the others plunged at once into the forest. Although the pigs were plenty they were singularly agile, and not in the humor to be captured. However, after half an hour’s chasing the hunters had captured a couple in their lair, when cries mingled with horrible hoarse sounds, having nothing human in them, were heard. Pencroff and Spilett sprang to their feet, regardless of the pigs, which escaped.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is Herbert!” cried the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hurry!” cried the sailor, as the two ran with their utmost speed towards the place from whence the cries came.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They had need to hasten, for at a turn in the path they saw the lad prostrate beneath a savage, or perhaps a gigantic ape, who was throttling him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To throw themselves on this monster and pinion him to the ground, dragging Herbert away, was the work of a moment. The sailor had herculean strength. Spilett, too, was muscular, and, in spite of the resistance of the monster, it was bound so that it could not move.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You are not wounded, Herbert?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, oh no.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ah! if it had hurt you, this ape-”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But he is not an ape!” cried Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At these words Pencroff and Spilett looked again at the object lying on the ground. In fact, it was not an ape, but a human being—a man! But what a man! He was a savage, in all the horrible acceptation of the word; and, what was more frightful, he seemed to have fallen to the last degree of brutishness.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Matted hair, tangled beard descending to his waist, his body naked, save for a rag about his loins, wild eyes, long nails, mahogany-colored skin, feet as hard as if they had been made of horn; such was the miserable creature which it was, nevertheless, necessary to call a man. But one might well question whether this body still contained a soul, or whether the low, brutish instinct alone survived.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Are you perfectly sure that this is what has been a man?” questioned Pencroff of the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Alas! there can be no doubt of it,” replied Spilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Can he be the person shipwrecked?” asked Herbert</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes,” responded the reporter, “but the poor creature is no longer human.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Spilett was right. Evidently, if the castaway had ever been civilized, isolation had made him a savage, a real creature of the woods. He gave utterance to hoarse sounds, from between teeth which were as sharp as those of animals living on raw flesh. Memory had doubtless long ago left him, and he had long since forgotten the use of arms and tools, and even how to make a fire. One could see that he was active and supple, but that his physical qualities had developed to the exclusion of his moral perception.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Spilett spoke to him, but he neither understood nor listened, and, looking him in the eye, the reporter could see that all intelligence had forsaken him. Nevertheless, the prisoner did not struggle or strive to break his bonds. Was he cowed by the presence of these men, whom he had once resembled? Was there in some corner of his brain a flitting remembrance which drew him towards humanity? Free, would he have fled or would he have remained? They did not know, and they did not put him to the proof. After having looked attentively at the miserable creature, Spilett said:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What he is, what he has been, and what he will be; it is still our duty to take him to Lincoln Island.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Oh yes, yes,” exclaimed Herbert, “and perhaps we can, with care, restore to him some degree of intelligence.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The soul never dies,” answered the reporter, “and it would be a great thing to bring back this creature of God’s making from his brutishness.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff shook his head doubtfully.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is necessary to try at all events,” said the reporter, “humanity requires it of us.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It was, indeed, their duty as civilized and Christian beings, and they well knew that Smith would approve of their course.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Shall we leave him bound?” inquired the sailor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Perhaps if we unfasten his feet he will walk,” said Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, let us try,” replied the sailor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And the cords binding the creature’s legs were loosened, although his arms were kept firmly bound. He rose without manifesting any desire to escape. His tearless eyes darted sharp glances upon the three men who marched beside him, and nothing denoted that he remembered being or having been like them. A wheezing sound escaped from his lips, and his aspect was wild, but he made no resistance.</p>
<p class="calibre3">By the advice of the reporter, the poor wretch was taken to the house, where, perhaps, the sight of the objects in it might make some impression upon him. Perhaps a single gleam would awaken his sleeping consciousness, illuminate his darkened mind.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The house was near by, and in a few minutes they were there; but the prisoner recognized nothing—he seemed to have lost consciousness of everything. Could it be that this brutish state was due to his long imprisonment on the island? That, having come here a reasoning being, his isolation had reduced him to this state?</p>
<p class="calibre3">The reporter thought that perhaps the sight of fire might affect him, and in a moment one of those lovely flames which attract even animals lit up the fireplace. The sight of this flame seemed at first to attract the attention of the unfortunate man, but very soon he ceased regarding it. Evidently, for the present at least, there was nothing to do but take him aboard the Good Luck, which was accordingly done. He was left in charge of Pencroff, while the two others returned to the island and brought over the arms and implements, a lot of seeds, some game, and two pairs of pigs which they had caught. Everything was put on board, and the sloop rode ready to hoist anchor as soon as the next morning’s tide would permit.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The prisoner had been placed in the forward hold, where he lay calm, quiet, insensible, and mute. Pencroff offering him some cooked meat to eat, he pushed it away; but, on being shown one of the ducks which Herbert had killed, he pounced on it with bestial avidity and devoured it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You think he’ll be himself again?” asked the sailor, shaking his head.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Perhaps,” replied the reporter. “It is not impossible that our attentions will react on him, since it is the isolation that has done this; and he will be alone no longer.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The poor fellow has doubtless been this way for a long time.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Perhaps so.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“How old do you think he is?” asked the lad.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That is hard to say,” replied the reporter, “as his matted beard obscures his face; but he is no longer young, and I should say he was at least fifty years old.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Have you noticed how his eyes are set deep in his head?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, but I think that they are more human than one would suspect from his general appearance.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, we will see,” said Pencroff; “and I am curious to have Mr. Smith’s opinion of our savage. We went to find a human being, and we are bringing back a monster. Any how, one takes what he can get.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The night passed, and whether the prisoner slept or not he did not move, although he had been unbound. He was like one of those beasts that in the first moments of their capture submit, and to whom the rage returns later.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At daybreak the next day, the 17th, the change in the weather was as Pencroff had predicted. The wind hauled round to the northwest and favored the return of the Good Luck; but at the same time it had freshened, so as to make the sailing more difficult. At 5 o’clock the anchor was raised, Pencroff took a reef in the mainsail and headed directly towards home.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The first day passed without incident. The prisoner rested quietly in the forward cabin, and, as he had once been a sailor, the motion of the sloop produced upon him a sort of salutary reaction. Did it recall to him some remembrance of his former occupation? At least he rested tranquil, more astonished than frightened.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the 16th the wind freshened considerably, coming round more to the north, and therefore in a direction less favorable to the course of the Good Luck, which bounded over the waves. Pencroff was soon obliged to hold her nearer to the wind, and without saying so, he began to be anxious at the lookout ahead. Certainly, unless the—wind moderated, it would take much longer to go back than it had taken to come.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the 17th they had been forty-eight hours out, and yet nothing indicated they were in the neighborhood of Lincoln Island. It was, moreover, impossible to reckon their course, or even to estimate the distance traversed, as the direction and the speed had been too irregular. Twenty-four hours later there was still no land in view. The wind was dead ahead, and an ugly sea running. On the 18th a huge wave struck the sloop, and had not the crew been lashed to the deck, they would have been swept overboard.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On this occasion Pencroff and his companions, busy in clearing things away, received an unhoped-for assistance from the prisoner, who sprang from the hatchway as if his sailor instinct had returned to him, and breaking the rail by a, vigorous blow—with a spar, enabled the water on the deck to flow off more freely. Then, the boat cleared, without having said a word, he returned to his cabin.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Nevertheless, the situation was bad, and the sailor had cause to believe himself lost upon this vast sea, without the possibility of regaining his course. The night of the 18th was dark and cold. But about 11 o’clock the wind lulled, the sea fell, and the sloop, less tossed about, moved more rapidly. None of the crew thought of sleep. They kept an eager lookout, as either Lincoln Island must be near at hand and they would discover it at daybreak, or the sloop had been drifted from her course by the currents, and it would be next to impossible to rectify the direction.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff, anxious to the last degree, did not, however, despair; but, seated at the helm, he tried to see through the thick darkness around him. Towards 2 o’clock he suddenly started up, crying:—“A light! a light!” It was indeed a bright light appearing twenty miles to—the northeast. Lincoln Island was there, and this light, evidently lit by Smith, indicated the direction to be followed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff, who had been heading much too far towards the north, changed his course, and steered directly towards the light, which gleamed above the horizon like a star of the first magnitude.</p>

<h4 id="pgepubid00051" class="calibre2">CHAPTER XXXVII.</h4>
<p class="calibre3">THE RETURN-DISCUSSION—SMITH AND THE UNKNOWN—BALLOON HARBOR-THE DEVOTION OF THE ENGINEER-A TOUCHING EXPERIENCE-TEARS.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At 7 o’clock the next morning the boat touched the shore at the mouth of the Mercy. Smith and Neb, who had become very anxious at the stormy weather and the prolonged absence of their companions, had climbed, at daylight, to Prospect Plateau, and had at length perceived the sloop in the distance.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Thank Heaven! There they are,” exclaimed Smith; while Neb, dancing with pleasure, turned towards his master, and, striking his hands together, cried, “Oh, my master!”-a more touching expression than, the first polished phrase.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The engineer’s first thought, on counting the number of persons on the deck of the Good Luck, was that Pencroff had found no one on Tabor Island, or that the unfortunate man had refused to exchange one prison for another.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The engineer and Neb were on the beach at the moment the sloop arrived, and before the party had leaped ashore, Smith said:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We have been very anxious about you, my friends. Did anything happen to you?” “No, indeed; everything went finely,” replied Spilett. “We will tell you all about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Nevertheless, you have failed in your search, since you are all alone.”, “But, sir, there are four of us,” said the sailor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Have you found this person?”. “Yes.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And brought him back?” “Yes.” “Living?” “Where is he, and what is he, then?” “He is, or rather, he was a human being; and that is all, Cyrus, that we can say.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The engineer was thereupon, informed of everything that had happened; of the search, of the long-abandoned house, of the capture of the scarcely human inhabitant.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And,” added Pencroff,” I don’t know whether we have done right in bringing him here.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Most certainly you have done right,” replied the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But the poor fellow has no sense at all.” “Not now, perhaps; in a few months, he will be as much a man as any of us. “Who knows what might happen to the last one of us, after living for a long time alone on this island? It is terrible to be all alone, my friends, and it is probable that solitude quickly overthrows reason, since you have found this poor being in such a condition.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But, Mr. Smith,” asked Herbert, “what makes you think that the brutishness of this man has come on within a little while?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Because the paper we found had been recently written, and no one but this shipwrecked man could have written it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Unless,” suggested Spilett, “it had been written by a companion of this man who has since died.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That is impossible, Spilett.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why so?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Because, then, the paper would have mentioned two persons instead of one.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Herbert briefly related the incident of the sea striking the sloop, and insisted that the prisoner must then have had a glimmer of his sailor instinct.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You are perfectly right, Herbert,” said the engineer, “to attach great importance to this fact. This poor man will not be incurable; despair has made him what he is. But here he will find his kindred, and if he still has any reason, we will save it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then, to Smith’s great pity and Neb’s wonderment, the man was brought up from the cabin of the sloop, and as soon as he was on land, he manifested a desire to escape. But Smith, approaching him, laid his hand authoritatively upon his shoulder and looked at him with infinite tenderness. Thereupon the poor wretch, submitting to a sort of instantaneous power, became quiet, his eyes fell, his head dropped forward, and he made no further resistance.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Poor shipwrecked sailor,” murmured the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith regarded him attentively. To judge from his appearance, this miserable creature had little of the human left in him; but Smith caught in his glance, as the reporter had done, an almost imperceptible gleam of intelligence.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was decided that the Unknown, as his new companions called him, should stay in one of the rooms of Granite House, from which he could not escape. He made no resistance to being conducted there, and with good care they might, perhaps, hope that some day he would prove a companion to them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Neb hastened to prepare breakfast, for the voyagers were very hungry, and during the meal Smith made them relate in detail every incident of the cruise. He agreed with them in thinking that the name of the Britannia gave them reason to believe that the Unknown was either English or American; and, moreover, under all the growth of hair covering the man’s face, the engineer thought he recognized the features characteristic of an Anglo-Saxon.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But, by the way, Herbert,” said the reporter, “you have never told us how you met this savage, and we know nothing, except that he would have strangled you, had we not arrived so opportunely.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Indeed, I am not sure that I can tell just what happened,” replied Herbert. “I was, I think, gathering seeds, when I heard a tremendous noise in a high tree near by. I had hardly time to turn, when this unhappy creature, who had, doubtless, been hidden crouching in the tree, threw himself upon me; and, unless Mr. Spilett and Pencroff—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You were in great danger, indeed, my boy,” said Smith; “but perhaps, if this had not happened, this poor being would have escaped your search, and we would have been without another companion.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You expect, then, to make him a man again?” asked the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes,” replied Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Breakfast ended, all returned to the shore and began unloading the sloop; and the engineer examined the arms and tools, but found nothing to establish the identity of the Unknown.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The pigs were taken to the stables, to which they would soon become accustomed. The two barrels of powder and shot and the caps were a great acquisition, and it was determined to make a small powder magazine in the upper cavern of Granite House, where there would be no danger of an explosion. Meantime, since the pyroxyline answered very well, there was no present need to use this powder.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When the sloop was unloaded Pencroff said:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I think, Mr. Smith, that it would be better to put the Good Luck in a safe place.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Is it not safe enough at the mouth of the Mercy?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, sir,” replied the sailor. “Most of the time she is aground on the sand, which strains her.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Could not she be moored out in the stream?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“She could, but the place is unsheltered, and in an easterly wind I am afraid she would suffer from the seas.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Very well; where do you want to put her?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“In Balloon Harbor,” replied the sailor. “It seems to me that that little inlet, hidden by the rocks, is just the place for her.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Isn’t it too far off?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, it is only three miles from Granite House, and we have a good straight road there.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Have your way, Pencroff,” replied the engineer. “Nevertheless, I should prefer to have the sloop under our sight. We must, when we have time, make a small harbor.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Capital!” cried Pencroff. “A harbor with a light house, a breakwater, and a dry dock! Oh, indeed, sir, everything will be easy enough with you!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Always provided, my good man, that you assist me, as you do three fourths of the work.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Herbert and the sailor went aboard the Good Luck, and set sail, and in a couple of hours the sloop rode quietly at anchor in the tranquil water of Balloon Harbor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">During the first few days that the Unknown was at Granite House, had he given any indication of a change in his savage nature? Did not a brighter light illumine the depths of his intelligence? Was not, in short, his reason returning to him? Undoubtedly, yes; and Smith and Spilett questioned whether this reason had ever entirely forsaken him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At first this man, accustomed to the air and liberty which he had had in Tabor Island, was seized with fits of passion, and there was danger of his throwing himself out of one of the windows of Granite House. But little by little he grew more quiet, and he was allowed to move about without restraint.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Already forgetting his carnivorous instincts, he accepted a less bestial nourishment, and cooked food did not produce in him the sentiment of disgust which he had shown on board the Good Luck.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith had taken advantage of a time when the man was asleep to cut the hair and beard which had grown like a mane about his face, and had given him such a savage aspect. He had also been clothed more decently, and the result was that the Unknown appeared more like a human being, and it seemed as if the expression of his eyes was softened. Certainly, sometimes, when intelligence was visible, the expression of this man had a sort of beauty.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Every day, Smith made a point of passing some hours in his company. He worked beside him, and occupied himself in various ways to attract his attention. It would suffice, if a single ray of light illuminated his reason, if a single remembrance crossed his mind. Neither did the engineer neglect to speak in a loud voice, so as to penetrate by both sound and sight to the depths of this torpid intelligence. Sometimes one or another of the party joined the engineer, and they usually talked of such matters pertaining to the sea as would be likely to interest the man. At times the Unknown gave a sort of vague attention to what was said, and soon the colonists began to think that he partly understood them. Again his expression would be dolorous, proving that he suffered inwardly. Nevertheless, he did not speak, although they thought, at times, from his actions, that words were about to pass his lips.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The poor creature was very calm and sad. But was not the calmness only on the surface, and the sadness the result of his confinement? They could not yet say. Seeing only certain objects and in a limited space, always with the colonists, to whom he had become accustomed, having no desire to satisfy, better clothed and better fed, it was natural that his physical nature should soften little by little; but was he imbued with the new life, or, to use an expression justly applicable to the case, was he only tamed, as an animal in the presence of its master? This was the important question Smith was anxious to determine, and meantime he did not wish to be too abrupt with his patient. For to him, the unknown was but a sick person. Would he ever be a convalescent?</p>
<p class="calibre3">Therefore, the engineer watched him unceasingly. How he laid in wait for his reason, so to speak, that he might lay hold of it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists followed with strong interest all the phases of this cure undertaken by Smith. All aided him in it, and all, save perhaps the incredulous Pencroff, came to share in his belief and hope.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The submission of the Unknown was entire, and it seemed as if he showed for the engineer, whose influence over him was apparent, a sort of attachment, and Smith resolved now to test it by transporting him to another scene, to that ocean which he had been accustomed to look upon, to the forest border, which would recall those woods where he had lived such a life!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But,” said Spilett, “can we hope that once at liberty, he will not escape?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We must make the experiment,” replied the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“All right,” said Pencroff. “You will see, when this fellow snuffs the fresh air and sees the coast clear, if he don’t make his legs spin!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I don’t think it,” replied the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We will try, any how,” said Spilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was the 30th of October, and the Unknown had been a prisoner for nine days. It was a beautiful, warm, sunshiny day. Smith and Pencroff went to the room of the Unknown, whom they found at the window gazing out at the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Come, my friend,” said the engineer to him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The Unknown rose immediately. His eye was fixed on Smith, whom he followed; and the sailor, little confident in the results of the experiment, walked with him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Having reached the door, they made him get into the elevator, at the foot of which the rest of the party were waiting. The basket descended, and in a few seconds all were standing together on the shore.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists moved off a little distance from the Unknown, so as to leave him quite at liberty. He made some steps forward towards the sea, and his face lit up with pleasure, but he made no effort to escape. He looked curiously at the little waves, which, broken by the islet, died away on the shore.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is not, indeed, the ocean,” remarked Spilett, “and it is possible that this does not give him the idea of escaping.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes,” replied Smith, “we must take him to the plateau on the edge of the forest. There the experiment will be more conclusive.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“There he cannot get away, since the bridges are all raised,” said Neb.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Oh, he is not the man to be troubled by such a brook as Glycerine Creek; he could leap it at a bound,” returned Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We will see presently,” said Smith, who kept his eye fixed on his patient.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And thereupon all proceeded towards Prospect Plateau. Having reached the place they encountered the outskirts of the forest, with its leaves trembling in the wind, The Unknown seemed to drink in with eagerness the perfume in the air, and a long sigh escaped from his breast.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists stood some paces back, ready to seize him if he attempted to escape.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The poor creature was upon the point of plunging in the creek that separated him from the forest; he placed himself ready to spring—then all at once he turned about, dropping his arms beside him, and tears coursed down his cheeks.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ah!” cried Smith, “you will be a man again, since you weep!”</p>
<p class="calibre3"><a id="XXXVIII"></a></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00052" class="calibre2">CHAPTER XXXVIII</h4>
<p class="calibre3">A MYSTERY TO BE SOLVED—THE FIRST WORDS OF THE UNKNOWN—TWELVE YEARS ON THE ISLAND—CONFESSIONS—DISAPPEARANCE—SMITH’S CONFIDENCE —BUILDING A WIND-MILL—THE FIRST BREAD—AN ACT OF DEVOTION—HONEST HANDS.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Yes, the poor creature had wept. Some remembrance had flashed across his spirit, and, as Smith had said, he would be made a man through his tears.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists left him for some time, withdrawing themselves, so that he could feel perfectly at liberty; but he showed no inclination to avail himself of this freedom, and Smith soon decided to take him back to Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Two days after this occurrence, the Unknown showed a disposition to enter little by little into the common life. It was evident that he heard, that he understood, but it was equally evident that he manifested a strange disinclination to speak to them. Pencroff, listening at his room, heard these words escape him:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No! here! I! never!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The sailor reported this to his companions, and Smith said:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“There must be some sad mystery here.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The Unknown had begun to do some little chores, and to work in the garden. When he rested, which was frequent, he seemed entirely self-absorbed; but, on the advice of the engineer, the others respected the silence, which he seemed desirous of keeping. If one of the colonists approached him he recoiled, sobbing as if overcome. Could it be by remorse? or, was it, as Spilett once suggested:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“If he does not speak I believe it is because he has something on his mind too terrible to mention.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Some days later the Unknown was working on the plantation, when, of a sudden, he stopped and let his spade fall, and Smith, who was watching him from a distance, saw that he was weeping again. An irresistible pity drew the engineer to the poor fellow’s side; and, touching his arm lightly,</p>
<p class="calibre3">“My friend,” said he.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The Unknown tried to look away, and when Smith sought to take his hand he drew back quickly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“My friend,” said Smith, with decision, “I wish you to look at me.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The Unknown obeyed, raising his eyes and regarding the other as one does who is under the influence of magnetism. At first he wished to break away, then his whole expression changed; his eyes flashed, and, unable longer to contain himself, he muttered some incoherent words. Suddenly he crossed his arms, and in a hollow voice:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Who are you?” he demanded.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Men shipwrecked as you have been,” replied the engineer, greatly moved. “We have brought you here among your kindred.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“My kindred! I have none!</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You are among friends—,”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Friends! I! Friends!” cried the Unknown, hiding his face in his hands. “Oh, no! never! Leave me! leave me!” and he rushed to the brink of the plateau overlooking the sea, and stood there, motionless, for a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith had rejoined his companions and had related to them what had happened.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“There certainly is a mystery in this man’s life,” said Spilett, “and it seems as if his first human sensation was remorse.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I don’t understand what kind of a man we have brought back,” says the sailor. “He has secrets—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Which we will respect,” answered the engineer, quickly. “If he has committed some fault he has cruelly expiated it, and in our sight it is absolved.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">For two hours the Unknown remained upon the shore, evidently under the influence of remembrances which brought back to him all his past, a past which, doubtless, was hateful enough, and the colonists, though keeping watch upon him, respected his desire to be alone.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Suddenly he seemed to have taken a resolution, and he returned to the engineer. His eyes were red with the traces of tears, and his face wore an expression of deep humility. He seemed apprehensive, ashamed, humiliated, and his looks were fixed on the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Sir,” said he, “are you and your companions English?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No,” replied Smith, “we are Americans.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ah!” murmured the Unknown, “I am glad of that.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And what are you, my friend?” asked the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“English,” he responded, as if these few words had cost him a great effort. He rushed to the shore, and traversed its length to the mouth of the Mercy, in a state of extreme agitation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Having, at one place, met Herbert, he stopped, and in a choking voice, accosted him:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What month is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“November,” replied the lad.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And what year?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“1866.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Twelve years! Twelve years!” he cried, and then turned quickly away.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Herbert related this incident to the others.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The poor creature knew neither the month nor the year,” remarked Spilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And he had been twelve years on the island, when we found him.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Twelve years,” said Smith. “Twelve years of isolation, after a wicked life, perhaps; that would indeed affect a man’s reason.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I cannot help thinking,” observed Pencroff, “that this man was not wrecked on that island, but that he has been left there for some crime.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You may be right, Pencroff,” replied the reporter, “and if that is the case, it is not impossible that whoever left him there may return for him some day.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And they would not find him,” said Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But, then,” exclaimed Pencroff, “he would want to go back, and—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“My friends,” interrupted Smith, “do not let us discuss this question till we know what we are talking about. I believe that this unhappy man has suffered, and that he has paid bitterly for his faults, whatever they may have been, and that he is struggling with the need of opening his heart to someone. Do not provoke him to speak; he will tell us of his own accord some day, and when we have learned all, we will see what course it will be necessary to follow. He alone can tell us if he has more than the hope, the certainty of some day being restored to his country, but I doubt it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why?” asked the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Because, had he been sure of being delivered after a fixed time, he would have awaited the hour of his deliverance, and not have thrown that paper in the sea. No, it is more likely that be was condemned to die upon this island, to never look upon his kind again.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But there still is something which I cannot understand,” said the sailor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What is that?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why, if this man had been left on Tabor Island twelve years ago, it seems probable that he must have been in this savage condition for a long time.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That is probable,” replied the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And, therefore, it is a long time since he wrote that paper.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Doubtless—and yet that paper seemed to have been written recently—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, and how account for the bottle taking so many years in coming from Tabor Island here?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is not absolutely impossible,” responded the reporter. “Could not it have been in the neighborhood of the island for a long time?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And have remained floating? No,” answered the sailor, “for sooner or later it would have been dashed to pieces on the rocks.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It would, indeed,” said Smith, thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And, moreover,” continued the sailor, if the paper had been enclosed in the bottle for a long time, it would have been injured by the moisture, whereas, it was not damaged in the least.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The sailor’s remark was just, and, moreover, this paper, recently written, gave the situation of the island with an exactness which implied a knowledge of hydrography, such as a simple sailor could not have.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“There is, as I said before, something inexplicable in all this,” said the engineer, “but do not let us urge our new companion to speak, When he wishes it we will be ready to listen.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">For several days after this the Unknown neither spoke nor left the plateau. He worked incessantly, digging in the garden apart from the colonists, and at meal times, although he was often asked to join them, he remained alone, eating but a few uncooked vegetables. At night, instead of returning to his room in Granite House, he slept under the trees, or hid himself, if the weather was bad, in some hollow of the rocks. Thus he returned again to that manner of life in which he had lived when he had no other shelter than the forests of Tabor Island, and all endeavor to make him modify this life having proved fruitless, the colonists waited patiently. But the moment came when, irresistibly and as if involuntarily forced from him by his conscience, the terrible avowals were made.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At dusk on the evening of the 10th of November, as the colonists were seated in the arbor, the Unknown stood suddenly before them. His eyes glowed, and his whole appearance wore again the savage aspect of former days. He stood there, swayed by some terrible emotion, his teeth chattering like those of a person in a fever. The colonists were astounded. “What was the matter with him? Was the sight of his fellow-creatures unendurable? Had he had enough of this honest life? Was he homesick for his brutish life? One would have thought so, hearing him give utterance to these incoherent phrases:-</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why am I here? By what right did you drag me from my island? Is there any bond between you and me? Do you know who I am—what I have done—why I was there—alone? And who has told you that I was not abandoned—that I was not condemned to die there? Do you know my past? Do you know whether I have not robbed, murdered—if I am not a miserable—a wicked being—fit to live like a wild beast—far from all—say—do you know?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists listened silently to the unhappy creature, from whom these half avowals came in spite of himself. Smith, wishing to soothe him, would have gone to him, but the Unknown drew back quickly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No! no!” he cried. “One word only—am I free?”.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You are free,” replied the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then, good-bye!” he cried, rushing off.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Neb, Pencroff, and Herbert ran to the border of the wood, but they returned alone.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We must let him have his own way,” said the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“He will never come back,” exclaimed Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“He will return,” replied the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And after that conversation many days passed, but Smith—was it a presentiment—persisted in the fixed idea that the unhappy man would return sooner or later.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is the last struggle of this rude nature, which is touched by remorse, and which would be terrified by a new isolation.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the meantime, work of all kinds was continued, both on Prospect Plateau and at the corral, where Smith proposed to make a farm. It is needless to say that the seeds brought from Tabor Island had been carefully sown. The plateau was a great kitchen-garden, well laid out and enclosed, which kept the colonists always busy. As the plants multiplied, it was necessary to increase the size of the beds, which threatened to become fields, and to take the place of the grass land. But as forage abounded in other parts of the island, there was no fear of the onagers having to be placed on rations; and it was also better to make Prospect Plateau, defended by its belt of creeks, a garden of this kind, and to extend the fields, which required no protection, beyond the belt.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the 15th of November they made their third harvest. Here was a field which had indeed increased in the eighteen months since the first grain of corn had been sown. The second crop of 600,000 grains produced this time 4,000 bushels or more than 500,000,000 grains. The colonists were, therefore, rich in corn; as it was only necessary to sow a dozen bushels each year in order to have a supply sufficient for the nourishment of man and beast.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After harvesting they, gave up the last fortnight in the month to bread-making. They had the grain but not the flour, and a mill was therefore necessary. Smith could have used the other waterfall which fell into the Mercy, but, after discussing the question, it was decided to build a simple wind-mill on the summit of the plateau. Its construction would be no more difficult than a water-mill, and they would be sure of always having a breeze on this open elevation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Without counting,” said Pencroff, “the fine aspect a wind-mill will give to the landscape.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">They began the work by selecting timber for the cage and machinery for the mill. Some large sand-stones, which the colonists found to the north of the lake, were readily made into mill-stones, and the inexhaustible envelope of the balloon furnished the cloth necessary for the sails.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith made his drawings, and the site for the mill was chosen a little to the right of the poultry-yard, and close to the lake shore. The whole cage rested upon a pivot, held in position by heavy timbers, in such a manner that it could turn, with all the mechanism within it, towards any quarter of the wind.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The work progressed rapidly. Neb and Herbert had become expert carpenters, and had only to follow the plans furnished by the engineer, so that in a very short time a sort of round watch-house, a regular pepper-box, surmounted by a sharp roof, rose upon the site selected. The four wings had been firmly fastened by iron tenons to the main shaft, in such a manner as to make a certain angle with it. As for the various parts of the interior mechanism—the two mill-stones, the runner and the feeder; the hopper, a sort of huge square trough, large above and small below, permitting the grains to fall upon the mill-stones; the oscillating bucket, designed to regulate the passage of the grain; and, finally, the bolter, which, by the operation of the sieve, separated the bran from the flour—all these were easily made. And as their tools were good, the work simple, and everybody took part in it, the mill was finished by the 1st of December.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As usual, Pencroff was overjoyed by his work, and he was sure that the machine was perfection.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Now, with a good wind, we will merrily grind our corn.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let it be a good wind, Pencroff, but not too strong,” said the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Bah! our mill will turn the faster.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is not necessary to turn rapidly,” replied the engineer. “Experience has demonstrated that the best results are obtained by a mill whose wings make six times the number of turns in a minute that the wind travels feet in a second. Thus, an ordinary wind, which travels twenty-four feet in a second, will turn the wings of the mill sixteen times in a minute, which is fast enough.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Already!” exclaimed Herbert, “there is a fine breeze from the northeast, which will be just the thing!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">There was no reason to delay using the mill, and the colonists were anxious to taste the bread of Lincoln Island; so this very morning two or three bushels of corn were ground, and the next day, at breakfast, a splendid loaf, rather heavy perhaps, which had been raised with the barm of beer, was displayed upon the table of Granite House. Each munched his portion with a pleasure perfectly inexpressible.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Meantime the Unknown had not come back again. Often Spilett and Herbert had searched the forest in the neighborhood of Granite House without finding any trace of him, and all began to be seriously alarmed at his prolonged absence. Undoubtedly the former savage of Tabor Island would not find it difficult to live in the forests of the Far West, which were so rich in game; but was it not to be feared that he would resume his former habits, and that his independence would revive in him his brutish instincts? Smith alone, by a sort of presentiment, persisted in saying that the fugitive would return.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, he will come back,” he repeated with a confidence in which his companions could not share. “When this poor creature was on Tabor Island, he knew he was alone, but here, he knows that his kindred await him. Since he half-spoke of his past life, he will return to tell us everything, and on that day he will be ours.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The event proved the correctness of Cyrus Smith’s reasoning.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the 3d of December, Herbert had gone to the southern shore of the lake, to fish, and, since the dangerous animals never showed themselves in this part of the island, he had gone unarmed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff and Neb were working in the poultry-yard, while Smith and the reporter were occupied at the Chimneys making soda, the supply of soap being low.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Suddenly sharp cries of help were heard by Neb and Pencroff, who summoned the others, and all rushed towards the lake.</p>
