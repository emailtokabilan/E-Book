<p class="calibre3">There, Herbert stood facing a powerful jaguar, like the one which had been killed at Reptile End. Taken by surprise, he stood with his back against a tree, and the animal, crouching on his haunches, was about to spring upon him, when the Unknown, with no other arm than his knife, threw himself on the brute, which turned upon its new adversary.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The struggle was short. This man, whose strength and agility was prodigious, seized the jaguar by the throat in a vice-like grip, and, not heeding the claws of the beast tearing his flesh, he thrust his knife into its heart.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The jaguar fell, and the Unknown was about turning to go away, when the colonists came up, and Herbert, catching hold of him, exclaimed:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, no, you must not leave us!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith walked towards the man, who frowned at his approach. The blood was flowing from a wound in his shoulder, but he did not heed it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“My friend,” said Smith, “we are in your debt. You have risked your life to save our boy.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“My life,” murmured the Unknown; “what is it worth? less than nothing.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You are wounded?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That does not matter.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Will you not shake hands with me?” asked Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But on the lad’s seeking to take his hand, the Unknown folded his arms, his chest heaved, and he looked about as if he wished to escape; but, making a violent effort at self-control, and in a gruff voice:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Who are you?” he asked, “and what are you going to do with me?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was their history that he thus asked for, for the first time. Perhaps, if that was related, he would tell his own. So Smith, in a few words, recounted all that had happened since their departure from Richmond; how they had succeeded, and the resources now at their disposal.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The Unknown listened with the utmost attention.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then Smith told him who they all were, Spilett, Herbert, Pencroff, Neb, himself, and he added that the greatest happiness that had come to them since their arrival on Lincoln Island was on their return from the islet, when they could count one more companion.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At these words the other colored up, and bowing his head, seemed greatly agitated.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And now that you know us,” asked Smith, “will you give us your hand?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No,” answered the Unknown in a hoarse voice; “no! You are honest men. But I—”</p>
<p class="calibre3"><a id="XXXIX"></a></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00053" class="calibre2">CHAPTER XXXIX</h4>
<p class="calibre3">ALWAYS APART—A BEQUEST OF THE UNKNOWN’S—THE FARM ESTABLISHED AT THE CORRAL—TWELVE YEARS—THE BOATSWAIN’S MATE OF THE BRITANNIA —LEFT ON TABOR ISLAND—THE HAND OF SMITH—THE MYSTERIOUS PAPER</p>
<p class="calibre3">These last events justified the presentiments of the colonists. There was some terrible past in the life of this man, expiated, perhaps, in the eyes of men, but which his conscience still held unabsolved. At any rate, he felt remorse; he had repented, and his new friends would have cordially grasped that hand, but he did not feel himself worthy to offer it to honest men. Nevertheless, after the struggle with the jaguar, he did not go back to the forest, but remained within the bounds of Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">What was the mystery of this life? Would he speak of it some day? The colonists thought so, but they agreed that, under no circumstances, would they ask him for his secret; and, in the meantime, to associate with him as if they suspected nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre3">For some days everything went on as usual. Smith and Spilett worked together, sometimes as chemists, sometimes as physicists, the reporter never leaving the engineer, except to hunt with Herbert, as it was not prudent to allow the young lad to traverse the forest alone. As to Neb and Pencroff, the work in the stables and poultry-yard, or at the corral, besides the chores about Granite House, kept them busy.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The Unknown worked apart from the others. He had gone back to his former habit of taking no share in the meals, of sleeping under the trees, of having nothing to do with his companions. It seemed, indeed, as if the society of those who had saved him was intolerable.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But why, then,” asked Pencroff, “did he seek succor from his fellow-creatures; why did he throw this paper in the sea?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“He will tell us everything,” was Smith’s invariable answer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But when?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Perhaps sooner than you think, Pencroff.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">And, indeed, on the 10th of December, a week after his return to Granite House, the Unknown accosted the engineer and in a quiet humble voice said:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Sir, I have a request to make.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Speak,” replied the engineer, “but, first, let me ask you a question?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">At these words the Unknown colored and drew back. Smith saw what was passing in the mind of the culprit, who feared, doubtless, that the engineer would question him upon his past.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith took him by the hand.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Comrade,” said he, “we are not only companions, we are friends. I wanted to say this to you first, now I will listen.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The Unknown covered his eyes with his hand; a sort of tremor seized him, and for some moments he was unable to articulate a word.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Sir,” said he, at length, “I came to implore a favor from you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You have, four or five miles from here, at the foot of the mountain, a corral for your animals. These require looking after. Will you permit me to live over there with them?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith regarded the unhappy man for some time, with deep commiseration. Then:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“My friend,” said he, “the corral has nothing but sheds, only fit for the animals—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It will be good enough, for me, sir.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“My friend,” replied Smith, “we will never thwart you in anything. If you wish to live in the corral, you may; nevertheless, you will always be welcome at Granite House. But since you desire to stay at the corral, we will do what is necessary to make you comfortable.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Never mind about that, I will get along well enough.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“My friend,” responded Smith, who persisted in the use of this cordial title, “you must let us be the judges in that matter.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The Unknown thanked the engineer and went away. And Smith, having told his companions of the proposition that had been made, they decided to build a log house at the corral, and to make it as comfortable as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The same day the colonists went, with the necessary tools, to the place, and before the week was out the house was ready for its guest. It was built twenty feet from the sheds, at a place where the herd of moufflons, now numbering twenty-four animals, could be easily overlooked. Some furniture, including a bed, table, bench, clothes-press, and chest was made, and some arms, ammunition, and tools, were carried there.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The Unknown, meanwhile, had not seen his new home, letting the colonists work without him, while he remained at the plateau, wishing, doubtless, to finish up his work there. And, indeed, by his exertion the ground was completely tilled, and ready for the sowing when the time should arrive.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the 20th everything was prepared at the corral, aid the engineer told the Unknown that his house was ready for him, to which the other replied that he would sleep there that night.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The same evening, the colonists were all together in the great hall of Granite House. It was 8 o’clock, the time of their companion’s departure; and not wishing by their presence to impose on him the leave-taking, which would, perhaps, have cost him an effort, they had left him alone and gone up into Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They had been conversing together in the hall for some minutes, when there was a light knock on the door, the Unknown entered, and without further introduction:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Before I leave you, sirs,” said he, “it is well that you should know my history. This is it.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">These simple words greatly affected Smith and companions. The engineer started up.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We ask to hear nothing, my friend,” he said. “It is your right to be silent—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is my duty to speak.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then sit down.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I will stand where I am.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We are ready to hear what you have to say,” said Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The Unknown stood in a shadowed corner of the hall, bare-headed, his arms crossed on his breast. In this position, in a hoarse voice, speaking as one who forces himself to speak, he made the following recital, uninterrupted by any word from his auditors:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“On the 20th of December, 1854, a steam pleasure-yacht, the Duncan, belonging to a Scotch nobleman, Lord Glenarvan, cast anchor at Cape Bernoulli, on the western coast of Australia, near the thirty-seventh parallel. On board the yacht were Lord Glenarvan, his wife, a major in the English army, a French geographer, a little boy, and a little girl. These two last were the children of Captain Grant, of the ship Britannia, which, with its cargo, had been lost the year before. The Duncan was commanded by Captain John Mangles, and was manned by a crew of fifteen men.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“This is the reason why the yacht was on the Australian coast at that season:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Six months before, a bottle containing a paper written in English, German, and French, had been picked up by the Duncan in the Irish Sea. This paper said, in substance, that three persons still survived from the wreck of the Britannia; that they were the captain and two of the men; that they had found refuge on a land of which the latitude and longitude was given, but the longitude, blotted by the sea water, was no longer legible.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The latitude was 37° 11’ south. Now, as the longitude was unknown, if they followed the latitude across continents and seas, they were certain to arrive at the land inhabited by Captain Grant and his companions.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The English Admiralty, having hesitated to undertake the search, Lord Glenarvan had resolved to do everything in his power to recover the captain. Mary and Robert Grant had been in correspondence with him, and the yacht Duncan was made ready for a long voyage, in which the family of Lord Glenarvan and the children of the captain intended to participate. The Duncan, leaving Glasgow, crossed the Atlantic, passed the Straits of Magellan, and proceeded up the Pacific to Patagonia, where, according to the first theory suggested by the paper, they might believe that Captain Grant was a prisoner to the natives.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The Duncan left its passengers on the western coast of Patagonia, and sailed for Cape Corrientes on the eastern coast, there to wait for them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Lord Glenarvan crossed Patagonia, following the 37th parallel, and, not having found any trace of the captain, he reembarked on the 13th of November, in order to continue his search across the ocean.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“After having visited without success the islands of Tristan d’Acunha and of Amsterdam, lying in the course, the Duncan, as I have stated, arrived at Cape Bernouilli on the 20th of December, 1854.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It was Lord Glenarvan’s intention to cross Australia, as he had crossed Patagonia, and he disembarked. Some miles from the coast was a farm belonging to an Irishman, who offered hospitality to the travellers. Lord Glenarvan told the Irishman the object which had brought him to that region, and asked if he had heard of an English three-master, the Britannia, having been lost, within two years, on the west coast of Australia.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The Irishman had never heard of this disaster, but, to the great surprise of everybody, one of his servants, intervening, said:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“‘Heaven be praised, my lord. If Captain Grant is still alive he is in Australia.’</p>
<p class="calibre3">“‘Who are you?’ demanded Lord Glenarvan.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“‘A Scotchman, like yourself, my lord,’ answered this man, ‘and one of the companions of Captain Grant, one of the survivors of the Britannia.’</p>
<p class="calibre3">“This man called himself Ayrton. He had been, in short, boatswain’s mate of the Britannia, as his papers proved. But, separated from Captain Grant at the moment when the ship went to pieces on the rocks, he had believed until this moment that every one had perished but himself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“‘Only,’ he added, ‘it was not on the western but on the eastern coast of Australia that the Britannia was lost; and if the Captain is still living he is a prisoner to the natives, and he must be searched for there.’</p>
<p class="calibre3">“This man said these things frankly and with a confident expression. No one would have doubted what he said. The Irishman, in whose service he had been for more than a year, spoke in his favor. Lord Glenarvan believed in his loyalty, and, following his advice, he resolved to cross Australia, following the 37th parallel. Lord Glenarvan, his wife, the children, the major, the Frenchman, Captain Mangles and some sailors formed the little party under the guidance of Ayrton, while the Duncan, under the command of the mate, Tom Austin, went to Melbourne, to await further instructions.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“They left on the 23d of December, 1861.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is time to say that this Ayrton was a traitor. He was, indeed, the boatswain’s mate of the Britannia; but, after some dispute with his captain, he had tried to excite the crew to mutiny and seize the ship, and Captain Grant had put him ashore, the 8th of April, 1832, on the west coast of Australia, and had gone off, leaving him there, which was no more than right.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Thus this wretch knew nothing of the shipwreck of the Britannia. He had just learned it from Lord Glenarvan’s recital! Since his abandonment, he had become, under the name of Ben Joyce, the leader of some escaped convicts; and, if he impudently asserted the ship had been lost on the east coast, if he urged Lord Glenarvan to go in that direction, it was in the hope of separating him from his ship, of seizing the Duncan, and of making this yacht a pirate of the Pacific.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Here the Unknown stopped for a moment. His voice trembled, but he began again in these words:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The expedition across Australia set out. It was naturally unfortunate, since Ayrton, or Ben Joyce, whichever you wish, led it, sometimes preceded, sometimes followed by the band of convicts, who had been informed of the plot.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Meanwhile, the Duncan had been taken to Melbourne to await instructions. It was therefore necessary to persuade Lord Glenarvan to order her to leave Melbourne and to proceed to the east coast of Australia, where it would be easy to seize her. After having led the expedition sufficiently near this coast, into the midst of vast forests, where all resources were wanting, Ayrton obtained a letter which he was ordered to deliver to the mate of the Duncan; a letter which gave the order directing the yacht to proceed immediately to the east coast, to Twofold Bay, a place some days journey from the spot where the expedition had halted. It was at this place that Ayrton had given the rendezvous to his accomplices.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“At the moment when this letter was to have been sent, the traitor was unmasked and was obliged to flee. But this letter, giving him the Duncan, must be had at any cost. Ayrton succeeded in getting hold of it, and, in two days afterwards, he was in Melbourne.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So far, the criminal had succeeded in his odious projects. He could take the Duncan to this Twofold Bay, where it would be easy for the convicts to seize her; and, her crew massacred, Ben Joyce would be master of the sea. Heaven stopped him in the consummation of these dark designs.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ayrton, having reached Melbourne, gave the letter to the mate, Tom Austin, who made ready to execute the order; but one can judge of the disappointment and the rage of Ayrton, when, the second day out, he learned that the mate was taking the ship, not to Twofold Bay on the east coast of Australia, but to the east coast of New Zealand. He wished to oppose this, but the mate showed him his order. And, in truth, by a providential error of the French geographer who had written this letter, the eastern coast of New Zealand had been named as their place of destination.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“All the plans of Ayrton had miscarried. He tried to mutiny. They put him in irons; and he was taken to the coast of New Zealand, unaware of what had become of his accomplices, or of Lord Glenarvan.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The Duncan remained on this coast until the 3d of March. On that day, Ayrton heard firing. It was a salute from the Duncan, and, very soon, Lord Glenarvan and all his party came on board.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“This is what had happened:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“After innumerable fatigues and dangers, Lord Glenarvan had been able to accomplish his journey and arrived at Twofold Bay. The Duncan was not there! He telegraphed to Melbourne, and received a reply:—’Duncan sailed on the 18th. Destination unknown.’</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Lord Glenarvan could think of but one explanation, that was that the good yacht had fallen into the hands of Ben Joyce, and had become a pirate ship.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Nevertheless, Lord Glenarvan did not wish to give up his undertaking. He was an intrepid and a generous man. He embarked on a merchant vessel, which took him to the west coast of New Zealand, and he crossed the country, following the 37th parallel without finding any trace of Captain Grant; but on the other coast, to his great surprise, and by the bounty of Heaven, he found the Duncan, commanded by the mate, which had been waiting for him for five weeks!</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It was the 3d of March, 1855. Lord Glenarvan was again on the Duncan, but Ayrton was there also. He was brought before his lordship, who wished to get from this bandit all that he knew concerning Captain Grant. Ayrton refused to speak. Lord Glenarvan told him, then, that at the first port, he would be given over to the English authorities. Ayrton remained silent.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The Duncan continued along the thirty-seventh parallel. Meanwhile, Lady Glenarvan undertook to overcome the obstinacy of the bandit, and, finally, her influence conquered him. Ayrton, in exchange for what he would tell, proposed to Lord Glenarvan to leave him upon one of the islands in the Pacific, instead of giving him up to the English authorities. Lord Glenarvan, ready to do anything to gain information concerning Captain Grant, consented.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then Ayrton told the history of his life, and declared that he knew nothing about Captain Grant since the day when the latter had left him on the Australian coast.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Nevertheless, Lord Glenarvan kept the promise he had made. The Duncan, continuing her route, arrived at Tabor Island. It was there that Ayrton was to be left, and it was there, too, that, by a miracle, they found Captain Grant and his two companions. The convict was put upon the island in their stead, and when he left the yacht, Lord Glenarvan spoke to him in these words:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“‘Here, Ayrton, you will be far from any country, and without any possible means of communicating with your fellow-men. You will not be able to leave this island. You will be alone, under the eye of a God who looks into the depths of our hearts, but you will neither be lost nor neglected, like Captain Grant. Unworthy as you are of the remembrance of men, you will be remembered. I know where you are, Ayrton, and I know where to find you. I will never forget it.’</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And the Duncan, setting sail, soon disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“This was the 18th of March, 1855.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ayrton was alone; but he lacked neither ammunition nor arms nor seeds. He, the convict, had at his disposal the house built by the honest Captain Grant. He had only to live and to expiate in solitude the crimes which he had committed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Sirs, he repented; he was ashamed of his crimes, and he was very unhappy. He said to himself that, as some day men would come to seek him on this islet, he must make himself worthy to go back with them. How he suffered, the miserable man! How he labored to benefit himself by labor! How he prayed to regenerate himself by prayer!</p>
<p class="calibre3">“For two years, for three years, it was thus. Ayrton, crushed by this isolation, ever on the watch for a ship to appear upon the horizon of his island, asking himself if the time of expiation was nearly ended, suffered as one has rarely suffered. Oh! but solitude is hard, for a soul gnawed by remorse!</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But, doubtless, Heaven found this unhappy wretch insufficiently punished, for he fell, little by little, till he became a savage! He felt, little by little, the brute nature taking possession of him. He cannot say whether this was after two or four years of</p>
<p class="calibre3">abandonment, but at last he became the miserable being whom you found.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I need not tell you, sirs, that Ayrton and Ben Joyce and I are one!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith and his companions rose as this recital was finished. It is hard to say how deeply they were affected! Such misery, such grief, and such despair, had been shown to them!</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ayrton,” said Smith, “you have been a great criminal, but Heaven has, doubtless, witnessed the expiation of your crimes. This is proved, in that you have been restored to your fellow-men. Ayrton, you are pardoned! And now, will you be our companion?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The man drew back.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Here is my hand,” said the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ayrton darted forward and seized it, great tears streaming from his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Do you desire to live with us?” asked Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Oh, Mr. Smith, let me have yet a little time,” he answered, “let me remain alone in the house at the corral!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Do as you wish, Ayrton,” responded Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The unhappy man was about retiring, when Smith asked him a last question.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“One word more, my friend. Since it is your wish to live in solitude, why did you throw that paper, which put us in the way of finding you, into the sea?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“A paper?” answered Ayrton, who seemed not to understand what was said.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, that paper, which we found enclosed in a bottle, and which gave the exact situation of Tabor Island?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The man put his hand to his forehead, and, after some reflection, said:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I never threw any paper into the sea!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Never!” cried Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Never!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">And then, inclining his head, Ayrton left the room.</p>
<p class="calibre3"><a id="XL"></a></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00054" class="calibre2">CHAPTER XL.</h4>
<p class="calibre3">A TALK—SMITH AND SPILETT—THE ENGINEER’S IDEA—THE ELECTRIC TELEGRAPH—THE WIRES—THE BATTER-THE ALPHABET—FINE WEATHER—THE PROSPERITY OF THE COLONY—PHOTOGRAPHY—A SNOW EFFECT—TWO YEARS ON LINCOLN ISLAND.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The poor man!” said Herbert, returning from the door, after having watched Ayrton slide down the rope of the elevator and disappear in the darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“He will come back,” said Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What does it mean?” exclaimed Pencroff. “That he had not thrown this bottle into the sea? Then who did it?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Certainly, if there was a reasonable question this was.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“He did it,” replied Neb; “only the poor fellow was half out of his senses at the time.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes,” said Herbert, “and he had no knowledge of what he was doing.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It can be explained in no other way, my friends,” responded Smith, hurriedly, “and I understand, now, how Ayrton was able to give the exact situation of the island, since the events prior to his abandonment gave him that knowledge.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Nevertheless,” observed Pencroff, “he was not a brute when he wrote that paper, and if it is seven or eight years since it was thrown into the sea, how is it that the paper has not been injured by moisture?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It proves,” said Smith, “that Ayrton retained possession of his faculties to a period much more recent than he imagines.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That must be it,” replied Pencroff, “for otherwise the thing would be inexplicable.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Inexplicable, indeed,” answered the engineer, who seemed not to wish to prolong this talk.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Has Ayrton told the truth?” questioned the sailor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes,” answered the reporter, “the history he has related is true in every particular. I remember, perfectly well, that the papers reported Lord Glenarvan’s undertaking and its result.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ayrton has told the truth,” added Smith, “without any doubt, Pencroff, since it was trying enough for him to do so. A man does not lie when he accuses himself in this way.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The next day—the 21st—the colonists went down to the beach, and then clambered up to the plateau, but they saw nothing of Ayrton. The man had gone to his house the night before, and they judged it best not to intrude upon him. Time would, doubtless, effect what sympathy would fail to accomplish.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Herbert, Pencroff, and Neb resumed their accustomed occupations; and it happened that their work brought Smith and Spilett together at the Chimneys.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Do you know, Cyrus, that your explanation of yesterday about the bottle does not satisfy me at all? It is impossible to suppose that this unhappy creature could have written that paper, and thrown the bottle into the sea, without remembering anything about it!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Consequently, it is not he who threw it there, my dear Spilett!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then you believe—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I believe nothing, I know nothing!” replied Smith, interrupting the reporter. “I place this incident with those others which I have not been able to explain!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“In truth, Cyrus,” said Spilett, “these things are incredible. Your rescue, the box thrown up on the beach, Top’s adventures, and now this bottle. Will we never have an answer to these enigmas?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes,” answered the engineer, earnestly, “yes, when I shall have penetrated the bowels of this island!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Chance will, perhaps, give us the key to this mystery.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Chance, Spilett! I do not believe in chance any more than I believe in mystery in this world. There is a cause for everything, however inexplicable, which has happened here, and I will discover it. But, while waiting, let us watch and work.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">January arrived, and the year 1867 began. The works had been pushed forward vigorously. One day Herbert and Spilett, passing the corral, ascertained that Ayrton had taken possession of his abode. He occupied himself with the large herd confided to his care, and thus saved his companions the necessity of visiting it two or three times a week. Nevertheless, in order not to leave Ayrton too much alone, they frequently went there.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was just as well—owing to certain suspicions shared by Smith and Spilett—that this part of the island should be under a certain supervision, and Ayrton, if anything happened, would not fail to let the inhabitants of Granite House know of it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Possibly, some sudden event might happen, which it would be important to communicate to the engineer without delay. And, aside from whatever might be connected with the mystery of the island, other things, requiring the prompt intervention of the colonists, might occur, as, for example, the discovering of a ship in the offing and in sight of the west coast, a wreck on that shore, the possible arrival of pirates, etc.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So Smith determined to place the corral in instant communication with Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was the 10th of January when he told his project to his companions.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“How are you going to do such a thing as that, Mr. Smith?” asked Pencroff. “Maybe you propose to erect a telegraph!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That is precisely what I propose to do.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Electric?” exclaimed Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Electric,” responded Smith. “We have everything necessary for making a battery, and the most difficult part will be to make the wires, but I think we can succeed.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Well, after this,” replied the sailor, “I expect some day to see us riding along on a railway!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">They entered upon the work at once, beginning with the most difficult part, that is to say, the manufacture of the wires, since, if that failed, it would be useless to make the battery and other accessories.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The iron of Lincoln Island was, as we know, of excellent quality, and, therefore, well adapted to the purpose. Smith began by making a steel plate, pierced with conical holes of different sizes, which would bring the wire to the desired size. This piece of steel, after having been tempered “through and through,” was fixed firmly to a solid frame-work sunk in the ground, only a few feet distant from the waterfall—the motive power which the engineer intended to use.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And, indeed, there was the fulling-mill, not then in use, the main shaft of which turned with great force, and would serve to draw out the wire and roll it around itself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The operation was delicate and required great care. The iron, previously made into long and thin bars, with tapering ends, having been introduced into the largest hole of the drawing-plate, was drawn out by the main shaft of the mill, rolled out to a length of 25 or 30 feet, then unrolled, and pulled, in turn, through the smaller holes; and at length, the engineer obtained wires 30 or 40 feet long, which it was easy to join together and place along the five miles between the corral and Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It took but a little while to get this work under way, and then, Smith, making his companions the wire-drawers, busied himself in the construction of his battery.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It was necessary to make a battery with a constant circuit. We know that modern batteries are usually made of a certain kind of coke, zinc, and copper. Copper the engineer was without, since, in spite of all his efforts, he had been unable to find a trace of it on the island. The coke, which is that hard deposit obtained from gas retorts could be procured, but it would be necessary to arrange a special apparatus—a difficult thing to do. As to the zinc, it will be remembered that the box found on Jetsam Point, was lined with a sheet of that metal, which could not be better utilized than at present.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith, after deep reflection, resolved to make a very simple battery, something like that which Becquerel invented in 1820, in which zinc alone is used. The other substances, nitric-acid and potash, he had at hand.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The manner in which he made this battery, in which the current was produced by the action of the acid and the potash on each other, was as follows:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">A certain number of glass vessels were made and filled with nitric-acid. They were corked with perforated corks, containing glass tubes reaching into the acid, and stopped: with clay plugs, connected with threads. Into these tubes the engineer poured a solution of potash—obtained from burnt plants—and thus the acid and the potash reacted on each other through the clay.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Then Smith plunged two plates of zinc, the one in the nitric acid, the other in the solution, and thus produced a circuit between the tube and jar, and as these plates had been connected by a bit of wire, the one in the tube became the positive and the other the negative pole of the apparatus. Each jar produced its currents, which, together, were sufficient to cause all the phenomena of the electric telegraph.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the 6th of February they began to erect the poles, furnished with glass insulators, and some days later the wire was stretched, ready to produce the electric current, which travels with the speed of 100,000 kilometres a second.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Two batteries had been made, one for Granite House, and the other for the corral, as, if the corral had to communicate with Granite House, it might, also, be needful for Granite House to communicate with the corral.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As to the indicator and manipulator, they were very simple. At both stations the wire was wrapped around an electro-magnet of soft iron. Communication was established between the two poles; the current, leaving the positive pole, traversed the wire, passed into the electro-magnet, and returned under ground to the negative pole. The current closed, the attraction of the electro-magnet ceased. It was, therefore, sufficient to place a plate of soft iron before the electro-magnet which, attracted while the current is passing, falls, when it is interrupted. The movement of the plate thus obtained, Smith easily fastened to it a needle, pointing to a dial, which bore the letters of the alphabet upon its face.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Everything was finished by the 12th of February. On that day Smith, having turned on the current, asked if everything was all right at the corral, and received, in a few moments, a satisfactory reply from Ayrton.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff was beside himself with delight, and every morning and evening he sent a telegraph to the corral, which never remained unanswered.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This method of communication presented evident advantages, both in informing the colonists of Ayrton’s presence at the corral, and in preventing his complete isolation. Moreover, Smith never allowed a week to pass without visiting him, and Ayrton came occasionally to Granite House, where he always found a kind reception.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Continuing their accustomed work, the fine weather passed away, and the resources of the colony, particularly in vegetables and cereals, increased from day to day, and the plants brought from Tabor Island had been perfectly acclimated. The plateau presented a most attractive appearance. The fourth crop of corn had been excellent, and no one undertook to count the 400,000,000,000 grains produced in the harvest; although Pencroff had had some such idea, until Smith informed him that, supposing he could count 300 grains a minute, or 18,000 an hour, it would take him 5,500 years to accomplish his undertaking.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The weather was superb, though somewhat warm during the day; but, in the evening, the sea-breeze sprung up, tempering the air and giving refreshing nights to the inhabitants of Granite House. Still there were some storms, which, although not long continued, fell upon Lincoln Island with extraordinary violence. For several hours at a time the lightning never ceased illuminating the heavens, and the thunder roared without cessation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This was a season of great prosperity to the little colony. The denizens of the poultry-yard increased rapidly, and the colonists lived on this increase, as it was necessary to keep the population within certain limits. The pigs had littered, and Pencroff and Neb’s attention to these animals absorbed a great part of their time. There were too young onagers, and their parents were often ridden by Spilett and Herbert, or hitched to the cart to drag wood or bring the minerals which the engineer made use of.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Many explorations were made about this time into the depths of the Far West. The explorers did not suffer from the heat, as the sun’s rays could not penetrate the leafy roof above them. Thus, they visited all that part to the left of the Mercy, bordering on the route from the corral to the mouth of Fall River.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But during these excursions the colonists took care to be well armed, as they often encountered exceedingly savage and ferocious wild boars. They also waged war against the jaguars, for which animals Spilett had a special hatred, and his pupil, Herbert, seconded him well. Armed as they were, the hunters never shunned an encounter with these beasts, and the courage of Herbert was superb, while the coolness of the reporter was astonishing. Twenty magnificent skins already ornamented the hall at Granite House, and at this rate the jaguars would soon be exterminated.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Sometimes the engineer took part in explorations of the unknown portions of the island, which he observed with minute attention. There were other traces than those of animals which he sought for in the thickest places in the forests, but not once did anything suspicions appear. Top and Jup, who accompanied him, showed by their action that there was nothing there, and yet the dog had growled more than once again above that pit which the engineer had explored without result.</p>
<p class="calibre3">During this season Spilett, assisted by Herbert, took numerous views of the most picturesque portions of the island, by means of the photographic apparatus, which had not been used until now.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This apparatus, furnished with a powerful lens, was very complete. All the substances necessary in photographic work were there; the nitrate of silver, the hyposulphata of soda, the chloride of ammonium, the acetate of soda, and the chloride of gold. Even the paper was there, all prepared, so that all that was necessary, in order to use it, was to steep it for a few moments in diluted nitrate of silver.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The reporter and his assistant soon became expert operators, and they obtained fine views of the neighborhood, such as a comprehensive view of the island taken from Prospect Plateau, with Mount Franklin on the horizon, the mouth of the Mercy so picturesquely framed between its high rocks, the glade and the corral, with the lower spurs of the mountain in the background, the curious outline of Claw Cape, Jetsam Point, etc. Neither did the photographers forget to take portraits of all the inhabitants of the island, without exception.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Its people,” as Pencroff expressed it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And the sailor was charmed to see his likeness, faithfully reproduced, ornamenting the walls of Granite House, and he stood before this display as pleased as if he had been gazing in one of the richest show-windows on Broadway.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It must be confessed, however, that the portrait, showing the finest execution, was that of master Jup. Master Jup has posed with a gravity impossible to describe, and his picture was a speaking likeness!</p>
<p class="calibre3">“One would say he was laughing!” exclaimed Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And if Jup had not been satisfied, he must have been hard to please. But there it was, and he contemplated his image with such a sentimental air, that it was evident he was a little conceited.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The heat of the summer ended with March. The season was rainy, but the air was still warm, and the month was not as pleasant as they had expected. Perhaps it foreboded an early and a rigorous winter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">One morning, the 21st, Herbert had risen early, and, looking from the window, exclaimed:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Hullo, the islet is covered with snow!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Snow at this season!” cried the reporter, joining the lad.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Their companions were soon beside them, and every one saw that not only the islet, but that the entire beach below Granite House, was covered with the white mantle.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is, indeed, snow,” said Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Or something very much like it,” replied Neb.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But the thermometer stands at 58°,” said Spilett.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith looked at the white covering without speaking, for he was, indeed, at a loss how to explain such a phenomenon in this season and in this temperature.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The deuce!” cried the sailor; “our crops will have been frost-bitten.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">And he was about descending when Jup sprang before him and slid down the rope to the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The orang had scarcely touched the earth before the immense body of snow rose and scattered itself through the air in such innumerable flocks as to darken all the heavens for a time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“They are birds!” cried Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The effect had, indeed, been produced by myriads of sea-birds, with plumage of brilliant whiteness. They had come from hundreds of miles around on to the islet and the coast, and they now disappeared in the horizon, leaving the colonists as amazed as if they had witnessed a transformation scene, from winter to summer, in some fancy spectacle. Unfortunately, the change had been so sudden that neither the reporter nor the lad had had an opportunity of knocking over some of these birds, whose species they did not recognize.</p>
<p class="calibre3">A few days later, and it was the 26th of March. Two years had passed since the balloon had been thrown upon Lincoln Island.</p>
<p class="calibre3"><a id="XLI"></a></p>
<h4 id="pgepubid00055" class="calibre2">CHAPTER XLI.</h4>
<p class="calibre3">THOUGHTS OF HOME—CHANCES OF RETURN —PLAN TO EXPLORE THE COAST—THE DEPARTURE OF THE 16TH OF APRIL—SERPENTINE PENINSULA SEEN FROM SEA—THE BASALTIC CLIFFS OF THE WESTERN COAST—BAD WEATHER—NIGHT—A NEW INCIDENT.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Two years already! For two years the colonists had had no communication with their fellows! They knew no more of what was happening in the world, lost upon this island, than if they had been upon the most distant asteroid of the solar system.</p>
<p class="calibre3">What was going on in their country? Their fatherland was always present to their eyes, that land which, when they left it, was torn by civil strife, which perhaps was still red with rebellious blood. It was a great grief to them, this war, and they often talked about it, never doubting, however, that the cause of the North would triumph for the honor of the American confederation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">During these two years not a ship had been seen. It was evident that Lincoln Island was out of the route of vessels; that it was unknown—the maps proved this—was evident, because, although it had no harbor, yet its streams would have drawn thither vessels desiring to renew their supply of water. But the surrounding sea was always desert, and the colonists could count on no outside help to bring them to their home.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Nevertheless, one chance of rescue existed, which was discussed one day in the first week of April, when the colonists were gathered in the hall of Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">They had been talking of America and of the small hope of ever seeing it again.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Undoubtedly, there is but one way of leaving the island,” said Spilett, “which is, to build a vessel large enough to make a voyage of some hundreds of miles. It seems to me, that, when one can build a shallop, they can readily build a ship.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And that they can as easily go to the Low Archipelago as to Tabor Island,” added Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I do not say we cannot,” replied Pencroff, who always had the most to say on questions of a maritime nature; “I do not say we cannot, although it is very different whether one goes far or near! If our sloop had been threatened with bad weather when we went to Tabor Island, we knew that a shelter was not far off in either direction; but 1,200 miles to travel is a long bit of road, and the nearest land is at least that distance!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Do you mean, supposing the case to occur, Pencroff, that you would not risk it?” questioned the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I would undertake whatever you wished, sir,” replied the sailor, “and you know I am not the man to draw back.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Remember, moreover, that we have another sailor with us, now,” said Neb.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Who do you mean,” asked Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ayrton.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That is true,” responded Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“If he would join us,” remarked Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why,” said the reporter, “do you think that if Lord Glenarvan’s yacht had arrived at Tabor Island while Ayrton was living there, that he would have refused to leave?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You forget, my friends,” said Smith, “that Ayrton was not himself during the last few years there. But that is not the question. It is important to know whether we can count on the return of this Scotch vessel as among our chances for rescue. Now, Lord Glenarvan promised Ayrton that he would return to Tabor Island, when he judged his crimes sufficiently punished, and I believe that he will return.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes,” said the reporter, “and, moreover, I think he will return soon, as already Ayrton has been here twelve years!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I, also, think this lord will come back, and, probably, very soon. But where will he come to? Not here, but to Tabor Island.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That is as sure as that Lincoln Island is not on the maps,” said Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Therefore, my friends,” replied Smith, “we must take the necessary precautions to have Ayrton’s and our presence on Lincoln Island advertised on Tabor Island.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Evidently,” said the reporter, “and nothing can be easier than to place in Captain Grant’s cabin a notice, giving the situation of our island.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is, nevertheless, annoying,” rejoined the sailor, “that we forgot to do that on our first voyage to the place.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why should we have done so?” replied Herbert. “We knew nothing about Ayrton at that time, and when we learned his history, the season was too far advanced to allow of our going back there.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes,” answered Smith, “it was too late then, and we had to postpone the voyage until spring.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But supposing the yacht comes in the meantime?” asked Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is not likely,” replied the engineer, “as Lord Glenarvan would not choose the winter season to adventure into these distant seas. Either it has already been to the island, in the five months that Ayrton has been with us, or it will come later, and it will be time enough, in the first fine weather of October, to go to Tabor Island and leave a notice there.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It would, indeed, be unfortunate,” said Neb, “if the Duncan has been to and left these seas within a few months.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I hope that it is not so,” answered Smith, “and that Heaven has not deprived us of this last remaining chance.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I think,” observed the reporter, “that, at least, we will know what our chances are, when we have visited the island; for those Stockmen would, necessarily, leave some trace of their visit, had they been there.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Doubtless,” answered the engineer. “And, my friends, since we have this chance of rescue, let us wait patiently, and if we find it has been taken from us, we will see then what to do.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“At any rate,” said Pencroff, “it is agreed that if we do leave the inland by some way or another, it will not be on account of ill-treatment!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No indeed, Pencroff,” replied the reporter, “it will be because we are far from everything which a man loves in this world, his family, his friends, his country!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Everything having been thus arranged there was no longer any question of building a ship, and the colonists occupied themselves in preparing for their third winter in Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">But they determined, before the bad weather set in, to make a voyage in the sloop around the island. The exploration of the coast had never been completed, and the colonists had only an imperfect idea of its western and northern portions from the mouth of Fall River to the Mandible Capes, and of the narrow bay between them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff had proposed this excursion, and Smith had gladly agreed to it, as he wished to see for himself all that part of his domain.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The weather was still unsettled, but the barometer made no rapid changes, and they might expect fair days. So, in the first week of April, after a very low barometer, its rise was followed by a strong west wind, which lasted for five or six weeks; then the needle of the instrument became stationary at a high figure, and everything seemed propitious for the exploration.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The day of departure was set for the 16th, and the Good Luck, moored in Balloon Harbor, was provisioned for a long cruise.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith told Ayrton of the excursion, and proposed to him to take part in it; but as Ayrton preferred to remain on shore, it was decided that he should come to Granite House while his companions were absent. Jup was left to keep him company, and made no objection.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the morning of the 16th all the colonists, including Top, went on board the Good Luck. The breeze blew fresh from the south-west, so that from Balloon Harbor they had to beat up against the wind in order to make Reptile End. The distance between these two points, following the coast, was twenty miles. As the wind was dead ahead, and they had had on starting but two hours of the ebb, it took all day to reach the promontory, and it was night before the point was doubled.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff proposed to the engineer that they should keep on slowly, sailing under a double-reef, but Smith preferred mooring some cable lengths from shore, in order to survey this part of the coast by daylight.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And it was agreed that henceforth, as a minute exploration of the island was to be made, they would not sail at night, but cast anchor every evening at the most available point.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The wind fell as night approached, and the silence was unbroken. The little party, excepting Pencroff, slept less comfortably than in their beds at Granite House, but still they slept; and at daylight the next morning the sailor raised anchor, and, with a free wind, skirted the shore.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists knew this magnificently wooded border, as they had traversed it formerly, on foot; but its appearance excited renewed admiration. They ran as close in as possible, and moderated their speed in order to observe it carefully. Often, they would cast anchor that Spilett might take photographic views of the superb scenery.</p>
<p class="calibre3">About noon the Good Luck arrived at the mouth of the Fall River. Above, upon the right bank, the trees were less numerous, and three miles further on they grew in mere isolated groups between the western spurs of the mountain, whose arid declivities extended to the very edge of the ocean.</p>
<p class="calibre3">How great was the contrast between the southern and the northern portions of this coast! The one wooded and verdant, the other harsh and savage! It was what they call in certain countries, an “iron-bound coast,” and its tempestuous aspect seemed to indicate a sudden crystallization of the boiling basalt in the geologic epochs. How appalling would this hideous mass have been to the colonists if they had chanced to have been thrown on this part of the island! When they were on Mount Franklin, their position had been too elevated for them to recognize the awfully forbidding aspect of this shore; but, viewed from the sea, it presented an appearance, the like of which cannot be seen, perhaps, in any portion of the globe.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The sloop passed for half a mile before this coast. It was composed of blocks of all dimensions from twenty to thirty feet high, and of all sorts of shapes, towers, steeples, pyramids, obelisks, and cones. The ice-bergs of the polar seas could not have been thrown together in more frightful confusion! Here, the rocks formed bridges, there, nave-like arches, of indistinguishable depth; in one place, were excavations resembling monumental vaults, in another a crowd of points outnumbering the pinnacles of a Gothic cathedral. All the caprices of nature, more varied than those of the imagination, were here displayed over a distance of eight or nine miles.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith and companions gazed with a surprise approaching stupefaction. But, though they rested mute, Top kept up an incessant barking, which awoke a thousand echoes. The engineer noticed the same strangeness in the dog’s action as he showed at the month of the well in Granite House.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Go alongside,” said Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And the Good Luck ran in as close to the rocks as possible. Perhaps there was some cavern here which it would be well to explore. But Smith saw nothing, not even a hollow which could serve as a retreat for any living thing, and the base of the rocks was washed by the surf of the sea. After a time the dog stopped barking, and the sloop kept off again at some cable lengths from the shore.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the northwest portion of the island the shore became flat and sandy. A few trees rose above the low and swampy ground, the home of myriads of aquatic birds.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the evening the sloop moored in a slight hollow of the shore, to the north of the island. She was close into the bank, as the water here was of great depth. The breeze died away with nightfall, and the night passed without incident.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The next morning Spilett and Herbert went ashore for a couple of hours and brought back many bunches of ducks and snipe, and by 8 o’clock the Good Luck, with a fair, freshening breeze, was speeding on her way to North Mandible Cape.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I should not be surprised,” said Pencroff, “if we had a squall. Yesterday the sun set red, and, this morning, the cats-tails foreboded no good.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">These “cats-tails”—were slender cyrrhi, scattered high above, in the zenith. These feathery messengers usually announce the near disturbance of the elements.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Very well, then,” said Smith, “crowd on all sail and make for Shark Gulf. There, I think the sloop will be safe.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Perfectly,” replied the sailor, “and, moreover, the north coast is nothing but uninteresting downs.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I shall not regret,” added the engineer, “passing, not only the night, but also tomorrow in that bay, which deserves to be explored with care.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I guess we’ll have to, whether we want to or no,” replied Pencroff, “as it is beginning to be threatening in the west. See how dirty it looks!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Any how, we have a good wind to make Mandible Cape,” observed the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“First rate; but, we will have to tack to get into the gulf, and I would rather have clear weather in those parts which I know nothing about.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Parts which are sown with reefs,” added Herbert, “if I may judge from what we have seen of the coast to the south of the gulf.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Pencroff,” said Smith, “do whatever you think best, we leave everything to you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Rest assured, sir,” responded the sailor, “I will not run any unnecessary risk. I would rather have a knife in my vitals, than that my Good Luck should run on a rock!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What time is it?” asked Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“10 o’clock.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And how far is it to the cape?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“About fifteen miles.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That will take two hours and a half. Unfortunately, the tide then will be going down, and it will be a hard matter to enter the gulf with wind and tide against us.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Moreover,” said Herbert, “it is full moon to-day, and these April tides are very strong.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But, Pencroff,” asked Smith, “cannot you anchor at the cape?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Anchor close to land, with bad weather coming on!” cried the sailor. “That would be to run ourselves ashore.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Then what will you do?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Keep off, if possible, until the tide turns, which will be about 1 o’clock, and if there is any daylight left try to enter the gulf; if not, we will beat on and off until daylight.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I have said, Pencroff, that we will leave everything to your judgment.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Ah,” said Pencroff, “if only there was a light-house on this coast it would be easier for sailors.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes,” answered Herbert, “and this time we have no thoughtful engineer to light a fire to guide us into harbor.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“By the way, Cyrus,” said Spilett, “we have never thanked you for that; but indeed, without that fire we would not have reached—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“A fire?” demanded Smith, astounded by the words of the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We wish to say, sir,” said Pencroff, “that we would have been in a bad fix on board the Good Luck, when we were nearly back, and that we would have passed to windward of the island unless you had taken the precaution to light a fire, on the night of the 19th of October, upon the plateau above Granite House.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Oh, yes, yes! It was a happy thought!” replied Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And now,” added Pencroff, “unless Ayrton thinks of it, there is not a soul to do us this little service.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No—no one!” replied Smith.</p>
<p class="calibre3">And a moment or two later, being alone with Spilett, the engineer whispered to him:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“If there is anything sure in this world, Spilett, it is that I never lit a fire on that night, either on the plateau or anywhere else!”</p>

<p class="calibre3">NIGHT AT SEA—SHARK GULF—CONFIDENCES—PREPARATIONS FOR WINTER—EARLY ADVENT OF BAD WEATHER—COLD—IN-DOOR WORK—SIX MONTHS LATER—A SPECK ON THE PHOTOGRAPH—AN UNEXPECTED EVENT.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The sailor’s predictions were well founded. The breeze changed to a strong blow such as would hare caused a ship in the open sea to have lowered her topmasts and sailed under close reefs. The sloop was opposite the gulf at 6 o’clock, but the tide was running out, so all that Pencroff could do was to bend the jib down to the mainmast as a stay-sail and lie to with the bows of the Good Luck pointing on shore.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Fortunately, although the wind was strong, the ocean, protected by the coast, was not very rough, and there was no danger from heavy seas, which would have tried the staunchness of the little craft. Pencroff, although he had every confidence in his boat, waited anxiously for daylight.</p>
<p class="calibre3">During the night Smith and Spilett had not another opportunity to talk alone, although the whispered words of the engineer made the reporter anxious to discuss with him again the mysterious influence which seemed to pervade Lincoln Island. Spilett could not rid himself of the thought of this new and inexplicable incident. He and his companions also had certainly seen this light, and yet Smith declared that he knew nothing about it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">He determined to return to this subject as soon as they returned home, and to urge Smith to inform their companions of these strange events. Perhaps, then, they would decide to make, altogether, a thorough search into every part of the island.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Whatever it was, no light appeared upon these unknown shores during this night, and at daylight the wind, which had moderated somewhat, shifted a couple of points, and permitted Pencroff to enter the gulf without difficulty. About 7 o’clock the Good Luck passed into these waters enclosed in a grotesque frame of lava.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Here,” said Pencroff, “is a fine roadstead, where fleets could ride at ease.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is curious,” remarked Smith, “that this gulf has been formed by two successive streams of lava, completely enclosing its waters; and it is probable that, in the worst weather, the sea here is perfectly calm.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“It is a little too large for the Good Luck,” remarked the reporter.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I admit that,” replied the sailor, “but if the navy of the United States needed a shelter in the Pacific, I don’t think they could find a better roadstead than this!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We are in the shark’s jaws,” said Neb, alluding to the form of the gulf.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We are, indeed,” replied Herbert; “but, Neb, you are not afraid that they will close on us?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, sir, not that; and yet I don’t like the looks of the place. It has a wicked aspect.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“So Neb begins running down my roadstead just as I was thinking to offer it to the United States!” cried Pencroff.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But are its waters deep enough?” asked the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That is easily seen,” answered the sailor, taking the sounding line, which measured fifty fathoms, and letting it down. It unrolled to the end without touching bottom.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“There,” said Pencroff, “our iron-clads could come here without running aground!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“In truth,” said Smith, “this gulf is an abyss; but when we remember the plutonic origin of the island, that is not extraordinary.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“One might think,” said Herbert, “that these walls had been cut with an instrument, and I believe that at their very base, even with a line six times as long, we could not reach the bottom.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“All this is very well,” said the reporter, “but I would suggest that Pencroff’s roadstead lacks one important element.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What is that?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“A cut, or pathway of some kind, by which one could go inland. I do not see a place where there is even a foothold.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">And, indeed, these steep lava walls afforded no landing place on all their circumference. The Good Luck, skirting within touching distance of the lava, found no place where the passengers could disembark.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Pencroff consoled himself by saying that they could blow up the wall, if they wanted to, and then, as there was certainly nothing to be done here, he turned towards the narrow opening, which was passed at 2 o’clock.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Neb gave a long sigh of relief. It was evident that the brave negro had not been comfortable in those enormous jaws!</p>
<p class="calibre3">The sloop was now headed for Granite House, eight miles distant, and, with a fair wind, coasted along within a mile of the shore. The enormous lava rocks were soon succeeded by the oddly-disposed downs, among which the engineer had been so singularly discovered, and the place was covered with sea-birds.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Towards 4 o’clock, Pencroff, leaving the islet to the left, entered the channel separating it from the island, and an hour later cast anchor in the Mercy.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The colonists had been absent three days. Ayrton was waiting for them on the shore, and Jup came joyously to welcome them, grinning with satisfaction.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The entire exploration of the coast had been made, and nothing suspicious had been seen. So that if any mysterious being resided on the island, it must be under cover of the impenetrable woods on Serpentine Peninsula, which the colonists had not, as yet, investigated.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Spilett talked the matter over with the engineer, and it was agreed that they should call their comrades’ attention to these strange events, the last one of which was the most inexplicable of all.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Are you sure you saw it, Spilett?” asked Smith, for the twentieth time. “Was it not a partial eruption of the volcano, or some meteor?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, Cyrus, it wag certainly a fire lit by the hand of man. For that matter, question Pencroff and Herbert. They saw it also, and they will confirm my words.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">So, some evenings later, on the 26th of April, when all the colonists were gathered together on Prospect Plateau, Smith began:—</p>
<p class="calibre3">“My friends, I want to call your attention to certain things which are happening in our island, and to a subject on which I am anxious to have your advice. These things are almost supernatural—”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Supernatural!” exclaimed the sailor, puffing his pipe. “Can anything be supernatural?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No, Pencroff, but certainly mysterious; unless, indeed, you can explain what Spilett and I have been unable to account for up to this time.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let us hear it, Mr. Smith,” replied the sailor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Very well. Have you understood, then, how, after being thrown into the sea, I was found a quarter of a mile inland, without my having been conscious of getting there?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Possibly, having fainted,”—began the sailor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“That is not admissible,” answered the engineer; “but, letting that go, have you understood how Top discovered your retreat five miles from the place where I lay?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“The dog’s instinct,” replied Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“A singular instinct,” remarked the reporter, “since, in spite of the storm that was raging, Top arrived at the Chimneys dry and clean!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let that pass,” continued the engineer; “have you understood how our dog was so strangely thrown up from the lake, after his struggle with the dugong?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No! that I avow,” replied Pencroff, “and the wound in the dugong which seemed to have been made by some sharp instrument, I don’t understand that at all.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Let us pass on again,” replied Smith. “Have you understood, my friends, how that leaden bullet was in the body of the peccary; how that box was so fortunately thrown ashore, without any trace of a shipwreck; how that bottle, enclosing the paper, was found so opportunely; how our canoe, having broken its rope, floated down the Mercy to us at the very moment when we needed it; how, after the invasion of the monkeys, the ladder was let down from Granite House; how, finally, the document, which Ayrton pretends not to have written, came into our hands?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith had thus enumerated, without forgetting one, the strange events that had happened on the island. Herbert, Pencroff, and Neb looked at each other, not knowing what to say, as this succession of events, thus grouped together, gave them the greatest surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Upon my faith,” said Pencroff, at length, “you are right, Mr. Smith, and it is hard to explain those things.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Very well, my friends,” continued the engineer, “one thing more is to be added, not less incomprehensible than the others!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“What is that?” demanded Herbert, eagerly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“When you returned from Tabor Island, Pencroff, you say that you saw a light on Lincoln Island?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Certainly I did.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And you are perfectly sure that you saw it?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“As sure as that I see you.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“And you, Herbert?”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Why, Mr. Smith,” cried Herbert, “it shone like a star of the first magnitude!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“But was it not a star?” insisted the engineer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“No,” replied Pencroff, “because the sky was covered with heavy clouds, and, under any circumstances, a star would not have been so low on the horizon. But Mr. Spilett saw it, and he can confirm what we say.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“I would add,” said the reporter, “that it was as bright as an electric light.”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Yes, and it was certainly placed above Granite House!” exclaimed Herbert.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“Very well, my friends,” replied Smith, “during all that night neither Neb nor I lit any fire at all!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">“You did not!—” cried Pencroff, so overcome with astonishment that he could not finish the sentence.</p>
<p class="calibre3">“We did not leave Granite House, and if any fire appeared upon the coast, it was lit by another hand!”</p>
<p class="calibre3">The others were stupefied with amazement. Undoubtedly a mystery existed! Some inexplicable influence, evidently favorable to the colonists, but exciting their curiosity, made itself felt upon Lincoln Island. Was there then some being hidden in its innermost retreats? They wished to know this, cost what it might!</p>
<p class="calibre3">Smith also recalled to his companions the singular actions of Top and Jup, about the mouth of the well, and he told them that he had explored its depths without discovering anything. And the conversation ended by a determination, on the part of the colonists, to make a thorough search of the island as soon as the spring opened.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After this Pencroff became moody. This island, which he had looked upon as his own, did not belong to him alone, but was shared by another, to whom, whether he would or not, the sailor felt himself inferior. Neb and he often discussed these inexplicable circumstances, and readily concluded that Lincoln Island was subject to some supernatural influence.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The bad weather began early, coming in with May; and the winter occupations were undertaken without delay. The colonists were well protected from the rigor of the season. They had plenty of felt clothing, and the moufflons had furnished a quantity of wool for its further manufacture.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ayrton had been comfortably clothed, and when the bad weather began, he had returned to Granite House; but he remained humble and sad, never joining in the amusements of his companions.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The most of this third winter was passed by the colonists indoors at Granite House. The storms were frequent and terrible, the sea broke over the islet, and any ship driven upon the coast would have been lost without any chance of rescue. Twice the Mercy rose to such a height that the bridge and causeways were in danger of destruction. Often the gusts of wind, mingled with snow and rain, damaged the fields and the poultry-yard, and made constant repairs necessary.</p>
