<h1 id="id_Toc3017546" class="block_18">Chapter 7</h1>
	<p class="block_15">After breakfast, M. Hoyvil took Antaska to the gym for her first workout. It was located between their quarters and the dining hall. An open archway led into an immense room the size of an Earth football field. Its tan-colored walls curved inward and upward to a domed ceiling about thirty feet above its deep-cushioned tan flooring. On the side of the room nearest to the door, Verdantes close to the size of M. Hoyvil exercised in two separate groups with two of the larger and heavier aliens as instructors. Males were in one group, and females were in another. </p>
	<p class="block_19">M. Hoyvil led Antaska to the back of the gym. A group of about twenty humans dressed as she was in tan t-shirts and exercise shorts stood facing their instructors. Antaska was shocked to see that the trainers were the attractive couple she had seen in the dining hall.</p>
	<p class="block_19">Up close, their defined muscles rippled underneath tight, form-revealing gym clothes. At about seven feet tall, they towered over the Earth humans in the class. Both appeared to have north European ancient Earth genes—high cheekbones, light skin, pale eyes, and blonde hair—and something else Antaska couldn’t identify.</p>
	<p class="block_19">They both turned to stare at Antaska as she approached. Long gold-toned hair flowed to the waist of the female. Her light-blue eyes shot ice fire at Antaska. The male stared with undisguised interest in his light gray-green eyes. He ran a hand through his straight platinum blonde hair. </p>
	<p class="block_19">M. Hoyvil spoke to Antaska. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“This is your class,” he said in a scratchy voice. </p>
	<p class="block_19">Then he walked back toward the front of the room. </p>
	<p class="block_19">For a moment, Antaska was frozen in her tracks, but she made an effort to stir herself. She joined the other students and stood among them looking at the trainers for instructions. </p>
	<p class="block_19">The two tall humans stared back unsmiling for a minute or two, looking over all their new students. Antaska felt grateful for the looseness of her clothes when she felt the eyes of first one, then the other, raking her body from top to bottom. </p>
	<p class="block_19">The stares of each of them made her uncomfortable but in different ways. A powerful thrill that somehow combined desire with fear twisted through her when the man’s eyes moved slowly up her body. His face wore a slight, somewhat lecherous smile. The woman’s cold, hard stare followed soon after, with her mouth set firm in a tight line. Finally, they finished their visual inspection, and the female spoke. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“Welcome new students. I am Tilde, and my partner is Eegor. I see that most of you aren’t used to a regular, intense exercise program. Starting now, that’s going to change. In the three months you’ll be in this class, we will work you hard. You will sweat, and you will strain. We will push and push you until you are in the best shape of your life. Do not even think about resisting; we are experts in what we do.” </p>
	<p class="block_19">Antaska was trying to pay attention, but Tilde’s first words distracted her. </p>
	<p class="block_19"><i class="calibre4">She just called him her partner. Does that mean teaching partner or something else?</i> Antaska wondered.</p>
	<p class="block_19">“You will do intense cardio to burn off your extra fat and train your body to run fast if you need to,” Tilde was saying. “You’ll lift heavy weights to build up your puny muscles, and you’ll learn martial arts for self-defense. You’re about to go on a trip into unknown space where unexpected things can happen. You can count on your Verdantes to keep you safe. But they want you to be in top physical condition and to be able to defend yourself in case of an unlikely emergency. Now we’ll get started.”</p>
	<p class="block_19">For the first hour, the instructors had the students alternate ten minutes of running around the gym or jumping in place with ten minutes of lifting weights. The two trainers circulated among them. They corrected their form and demanded that they work faster or harder. Anyone who slowed down in their running or lifting got embarrassing personal attention. Either the male or the female trainer would stand directly in front of the slacking exercisers shouting into their faces. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“Why are you stopping, you weak, pitiful excuse for a human? Keep moving, or I’ll throw you on the floor and knock the wind from your body, and your Verdante will thank me for it.” </p>
	<p class="block_19">This motivation was effective, and Antaska was relieved to see that, so far, no one had ended up on the floor gasping for breath. She exercised as hard as she could to avoid personal attention. But she still found the male instructor standing in front of her when she was doing shoulder presses—lifting a heavy bar above her head twelve times without stopping.</p>
	<p class="block_19">“Your form is all wrong. I, Eegor, will show you how it’s done,” he said in a thick, rough voice. </p>
	<p class="block_19">He struck a pose to display his muscular arms and chest, and Antaska’s mouth dropped open. Then he took the bar from her hands and easily lifted it above his head. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“Now you try,” he said.</p>
	<p class="block_19">He walked behind her and stood inches away from her back. </p>
	<p class="block_19">Antaska was stunned by his overwhelming attractiveness and flustered by this sudden unaccustomed, uninvited physical closeness, but she obediently raised up the bar. Her mind seemed to go completely blank as she lifted and Eegor pressed up next to her. He placed his large, firm chest against her back while grasping her forearms in his hands. </p>
	<p class="block_19">Eegor guided her arms up, saying, “Yes, this is the way.” </p>
	<p class="block_19">It didn’t seem much different from what she’d been doing, but Antaska didn’t say anything. She was both relived and disappointed when finally he moved away from her. Looking to the front of the class, Antaska met the narrowed, angry eyes of Tilde. She looked down in guilty confusion.</p>
	<p class="block_19">The second half of the class began. The trainers demonstrated basic kicking and punching moves and made the class repeat them many times each. Anyone who got tired or winded and stopped to rest was subjected to the intimidation of the trainers. Antaska was exhausted, but she kept going with the right-foot kick the class was practicing. In spite of her best efforts, she looked up to see seven-foot-tall muscular Tilde glaring down at her. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“You are wrong, I will show you,” said Tilde in a hostile, clipped tone. </p>
	<p class="block_19">Displaying perfect form, Tilde bent one knee to support the weight of her body as she leaned to that side. Then she swung and kicked her powerful opposite leg hard into Antaska’s rib cage. Antaska fell backward to the cushioned floor and curled up into a fetal position, clutching her stomach. She lay there momentarily unable to move from the painful blow. The instructor looked down at Antaska with a satisfied expression. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“That was my warning shot,” said Tilde.</p>
	<p class="block_19">Then she turned and walked away. </p>
	<p class="block_19">Antaska groaned. She felt her sore ribs. Were any broken? She had no idea how to tell that.</p>
	<p class="block_19">The woman who had been exercising next to Antaska stepped close to her and looked down at her with concern. She was short and slightly plump with bright red hair, pale skin, and freckles. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“Are you okay?” she asked in a soft, concerned voice. </p>
	<p class="block_19">Tilde spun around and faced her. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“Do not talk in class, or you will join her on the floor,” she said gruffly.</p>
	<p class="block_19">The small red-haired woman returned to her place. </p>
	<p class="block_19">Antaska wanted to stay down on the floor, but she pushed herself to sit up. </p>
	<p class="block_19"><i class="calibre4">What is her problem?</i> she thought about Tilde. <i class="calibre4">That female has some real jealousy and anger issues! Obviously this relationship isn’t healthy for her. Or that poor guy. I would be doing them both a favor to break them up, right?</i> </p>
	<p class="block_19">“Wrong! Wrong!” a tiny female voice spoke in her mind, accompanied by the image of Potat.</p>
	<p class="block_19">Antaska felt her head. </p>
	<p class="block_19"><i class="calibre4">I must have banged my head when I fell down</i>, she decided. <i class="calibre4">Anyway, back on Earth, people were always grateful to get broken up. Because we were taught not to get attached. Because we would all have to go our separate ways with the Verdantes. It’s kind of like that now, right?</i> she asked herself.</p>
	<p class="block_19">“No! No!” said the unwelcome voice in her head. </p>
	<p class="block_19">Ignoring the voice, Antaska stood back up and got back to kicking and punching, feeling the painful burn in her ribs with every movement. </p>
	<h2 class="block_20"><img src="images/alien-300px.png" alt="Image" class="calibre5"/></h2>
	<p class="block_15">During the workout, M. Hoyvil had been anxiously watching Antaska, and he saw when Tilde kicked her. Then he kept watching after that to make sure she was OK.</p>
	<p class="block_19"><i class="calibre4">Should I go over there?</i> he kept asking himself.</p>
	<p class="block_19">“I know you students are distracted on your first day in the gym with your new pets,” the gigantic adult trainer Master Mytaar addressed M. Hoyvil’s class. “But I warn you that distraction is a weakness that will be exploited by your opponents. And to prove my point and teach you this lesson, I will take advantage of that weakness right now.”</p>
	<p class="block_19">Master Mytaar looked around at the class. But M. Hoyvil wasn’t paying attention to the master. The big adult was more heavily muscled but shorter than most adult Verdantes, and he moved surprisingly fast for a being of his enormous size and bulk. He attacked M. Hoyvil in a blur of motion. He dropped M. Hoyvil to the floor with a kick to the legs, similar to Tilde’s kick to Antaska’s ribs but less painful.  </p>
	<p class="block_19">That got M. Hoyvil’s attention. He looked up almost ten feet at Master Mytaar. The master was staring down at him with a stern expression. But the lifted corners of the huge green eyes in his broad-featured dark green face indicated some amount of amusement. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“Of all the students today, you are the most distracted by worry for your new pet,” said the master telepathically. “Your concern is a sign of great strength of character, but it can also become your greatest weakness if you let it.” </p>
	<p class="block_19">M. Hoyvil stood up to face Master Mytaar, decreasing their height difference to less than two feet. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“I understand that, but I can’t help being worried about her. It looks like her instructors have singled her out for their personal attention. In fact, I would call it bullying. I think you should talk to them about that. And also, I would prefer if you call her my companion, not my ‘pet,’ if you don’t mind,” M. Hoyvil asked with some courage. </p>
	<p class="block_19">It was not the place of the student to instruct the master in what he should do.</p>
	<p class="block_19">The gigantic Master Mytaar chuckled. Then he spoke in the prophetic manner that was often used by the adults and that M. Hoyvil found so annoying. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“You are a brave and passionate one. I see that you are destined for greatness. Whether that will be great success or great suffering will depend on your actions and your reactions. Looking at the smaller picture, I don’t have a problem with calling her your <i class="calibre4">companion</i>,” he answered, pronouncing the word with extra emphasis.”</p>
	<p class="block_19">“Thank you, master,” M. Hoyvil replied with a nod of his head. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“I don’t really care what she is called,” the master continued. “But those two fitness instructors are my personal pets—my most perfect creations—and I won’t interfere with their classes. They are the product of genes I carefully selected from the most athletic of the human pets I’ve had for over a thousand years. During that time, I chose only Earth’s top athletes to join me as my pets and as physical trainers for the Earth humans who travel to deep space.</p>
	<p class="block_19">“My life partner wanted beautiful pets, so I allowed her to design their physical attractiveness chromosome mixtures using DNA she selected from the most beautiful of Earth humans. The final result is what I believe to be the two most physically powerful and beautiful humans who have ever lived,” said the master.</p>
	<p class="block_19">M. Hoyvil rolled his large green eyes, but Master Mytaar didn’t seem to notice. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“Over the hundred years Tilde and Eegor have been working with me as trainers, their unorthodox methods have proven successful and beneficial to the human pets they have trained. I designed them as the world’s two most attractive humans with the intention that they would become a romantic couple. And they are truly fond of each other, although their relationship has its rough spots,” said Master Mytaar. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“Oh. Rough spots,” said M. Hoyvil.</p>
	<p class="block_19">“That’s only to be expected from humans. As you know, they don’t have our ability to form deep bonds between life partners. Still, there are a few human couples who have stayed constant to each other while living among us as pets. Perhaps the influence of our positive example is what has made this possible for them,” said the master.</p>
	<p class="block_19">M. Hoyvil shuffled his feet. He felt like this explanation was more information than he needed, but the student did not interrupt the master.</p>
	<p class="block_19">“In any case,” said Master Mytaar, “I don’t think you realize that your<i class="calibre4"> companion </i>also played a part in this drama. In your excessive observance of her today, didn’t you notice that she encouraged the advances of my pet Eegor. Or at the least she didn’t discourage him? If she hadn’t shown such a weakness, Tilde wouldn’t have become jealous and felt the need to defend her territory.” </p>
	<p class="block_19">“Huh!” At a loss for words, M. Hoyvil let out an exclamation of offended indignation. “Are you saying that Antaska is responsible for the bad behavior of your pets?” </p>
	<p class="block_19">M. Hoyvil’s resentment of Tilde and Eegor overcame any objections he had about calling them pets.</p>
	<p class="block_19">“I’m not trying to blame or criticize Antaska. After all, she’s no more flawed than any other Earth human, and even among the Verdantes, we have our faults. Can any humanoid ever be perfect?” the master asked. “What I’m trying to say is that if my pets have singled out Antaska for their special attention, it’s a sign that she needs that attention. The universe always provides us with what we need, but we must be willing to accept that help in whatever form it is given.”</p>
	<p class="block_19">“Huh?” said M. Hoyvil again.</p>
	<p class="block_19">“Yes,” said Master Mytaar. “Be warned that your <i class="calibre4">companion</i> will have even greater challenges to face in the future. Be grateful that she’s being forced to learn to defend herself against much stronger forces that may threaten her. And the universe is not providing this lesson for her benefit alone. It’s clear that there’s something you also need to learn from this experience in order to face what lies ahead of you.” </p>
	<p class="block_19">M. Hoyvil wasn’t pleased by this explanation, but he bowed appropriately and answered, “Yes, instructor.” </p>
	<p class="block_19">As Master Mytaar walked away, M. Hoyvil’s thoughts about him were less than appropriate. </p>
	<p class="block_19"><i class="calibre4">I wonder if he’s just making excuses because he doesn’t want to upset his precious pets. The adults always claim to have superior knowledge because they talk to the trees. I guess the trees are experts on this situation</i>, M. Hoyvil thought sarcastically. </p>
	<p class="block_19">The large instructor turned back and looked at M. Hoyvil with the corners of his eyes lifted in a smug smile. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“Do not ever assume that I don’t know what you’re thinking,” he said. </p>
	<h2 class="block_20"><img src="images/alien-300px.png" alt="Image" class="calibre5"/></h2>
	<p class="block_15">A loud but melodious gong sounded throughout the gym. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“Time for exercise is over!” Tall, beautiful Tilde shouted at the class of Earth humans.</p>
	<p class="block_19">Antaska was relieved. The room darkened, and the occupants of the gym, both Earth human and Verdante, all sat down for a final stretch and cool down. After ten minutes, the gong sounded again, and the light in the room brightened. They all stretched and rose to their feet, and the Verdantes came to collect their human companions. Antaska slowly stood back up, pushing against her body’s aches and stiffness.</p>
	<p class="block_19">She was still in the painful process of straightening back up to a standing position when M. Hoyvil reached her side. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“Are you OK? Do you need a hand getting up?” he asked her. </p>
	<p class="block_19">His enormous eyes were wide with what she recognized as concern. </p>
	<p class="block_19">Antaska was touched, and she wanted to grab onto the big green hand. But she looked over and saw the two fitness instructors watching her. </p>
	<p class="block_19"><i class="calibre4">If he helps me up, they’ll see that as a sign of weakness</i>, she thought. <i class="calibre4">And Tilde will think she’s beaten me down.</i></p>
	<p class="block_19">“Thank you, but I’m fine. I can get up by myself,” said Antaska.</p>
	<p class="block_19">“OK. If you’re sure,” said M. Hoyvil. </p>
	<p class="block_19">He dropped his hand back to his side and waited. Then they walked together out of the gym.</p>
	<p class="block_19">As each of the students exited, a blue light filled the entranceway. M. Hoyvil paused to let Antaska go through first, then he followed. </p>
	<p class="block_19">Just outside the door, a disembodied voice spoke out loud. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“Four of the left ribs of this human are badly bruised but not broken. Place a cold pack on the ribs for twenty minutes.” </p>
	<p class="block_19">A small compartment opened up in the wall on the side of the doorway. Inside was a round, soft-looking liquid-filled object. M. Hoyvil reached in and removed the cold pack. He handed it to Antaska, and the opening in the wall closed again.</p>
	<p class="block_19">“I’m relieved to hear that nothing is broken. Hold this on your ribs, and it should help you feel better,” M. Hoyvil told her.</p>
	<p class="block_19">Antaska placed the pack on her sore ribs, and it did seem to help. She walked slowly, distracted more by thoughts of Eegor than by the pain. </p>
	<p class="block_19"><i class="calibre4">I guess this is proof that he really is interested in me</i>, she thought giddily. </p>
	<p class="block_19">Similar thoughts about Eegor swirled uncontrollably through her mind, accompanied by visual images of his physical perfections. </p>
	<p class="block_19"><i class="calibre4">Up close, he was even more beautiful than I imagined, almost like a work of art. Perfectly sculpted cheekbones and straight nose—not too small, not too big. The power of his intense gray-green eyes was irresistible. He really is the most handsome and physically fit man I’ve ever seen. How could he even notice me when it seems like the world’s most beautiful woman is his partner?</i> Antaska asked herself with a pleasurable surge of vanity. </p>
	<p class="block_19">M. Hoyvil was walking at a slow pace that was easy for Antaska to keep up with. He didn’t speak until they were inside their main room. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“Are you OK?” he asked again looking down at her. “Do you want to see Dr. Daji? Those trainers were much too rough on you.”</p>
	<p class="block_19">Antaska could sense some emotion in his facial expression and his words, and she was touched by his concern. At this moment, the beginning of a small but very real bond between them began to form. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“I’m sore, but I don’t need to see the doctor. The voice at the gym door said nothing is broken. Thank you for asking,” she answered.</p>
	<p class="block_19">In Antaska’s mind, the thrill of Eegor’s interest far outweighed the price of pain she had paid. She felt a strong urge to tell someone about what had happened but definitely not her new employer, M. Hoyvil. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“OK, but tell me if they get too rough, and I’ll do something about it,” M. Hoyvil promised. “Would you rather stay in the rooms and rest now instead of going to the meeting with me?” </p>
	<p class="block_19">“No, I want to go to the meeting,” Antaska answered. </p>
	<p class="block_19">He nodded, and they both went into their separate rooms to shower and change into their ship suits. </p>
	<p class="block_19">In Antaska’s room, Potat was still asleep on the round pillow on the round bed in the exact position she had been in when they left. Antaska sat next to her on the bed, and Potat opened her tiny golden eyes to stare up at her. Then Potat got up and rubbed softly against Antaska’s bruised side, purring loudly. Antaska petted her lightly but felt too sore to pick her up. </p>
	<p class="block_19">Bursting with the need to talk about her experience in the gym, she spoke to Potat. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“Something really interesting has happened. The most gorgeous, most buff man you’ve ever seen was looking at me in the dining hall, and today he came right over to me in gym class. I think he’s interested in me. Even though he might already have a partner, who is amazingly beautiful. Well, sometimes people change partners. That happens all the time. That’s how it was on Earth. Maybe their relationship is ending, and he’s looking for a new partner. What do you think?” </p>
	<p class="block_19">Of course, Potat didn’t answer. She didn’t seem to be interested in the story at all. </p>
	<p class="block_19"><i class="calibre4">I must have been crazy to think this cat was talking to me before</i>, Antaska thought. <i class="calibre4">She doesn’t care about my love life!</i></p>
	<p class="block_19">“I care, but you don’t listen,” Antaska imagined that Potat was answering her.</p>
	<p class="block_19">“Yeah, I must have hit my head too,” Antaska said.</p>
	<p class="block_19">Potat looked up at her and meowed.</p>
	<p class="block_19">“Hello!” Antaska imagined the cat voice was saying.</p>
	<p class="block_19">She bent over painfully to give Potat a small hug. Then she sat back up with a groan. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“I have to shower and get ready for the meeting now,” Antaska told her. “I’d like to take you, but I don’t know if that would be allowed. I’ll ask M. Hoyvil about it, and maybe you can go next time.” </p>
	<p class="block_19">Potat continued to circle around her, purring and pressing against her sides. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“I’m fine,” Antaska insisted. </p>
	<p class="block_19">She stood up slowly, still feeling the pain in her ribs, and got ready for the meeting.</p>
	<h2 class="block_20"><img src="images/alien-300px.png" alt="Image" class="calibre5"/></h2>
	<p class="block_15">M. Hoyvil waited for Antaska in the main room. He carried his backpack and computer. They were really going to one of his classes, but he had told Antaska it was a meeting. He wasn’t sure if she was ready to find out yet that he wasn’t really an adult, and this wasn’t really a job.</p>
	<p class="block_19">Antaska came out with Potat right behind her. But instead of standing next to the door and meowing like she did the last time they went out, Potat stopped in the middle of the room.</p>
	<p class="block_19"><i class="calibre4">She must not want to go with us this time</i>, M. Hoyvil thought.</p>
	<p class="block_19">Potat looked up at him and blinked. A low female voice seemed to echo in his mind, but he couldn’t make out the words.</p>
	<p class="block_19">“I’m sorry, but I can’t hear you very well,” M. Hoyvil apologized to her telepathically.</p>
	<p class="block_19">Potat blinked at him again. Then circled around the main room and headed into his room through his open door. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“That’s not your room!” Antaska called after her. </p>
	<p class="block_19">M. Hoyvil’s eyes curved up in a smile. </p>
	<p class="block_19">“It’s fine,” he told Antaska. “She can’t break anything in there.” </p>
	<p class="block_19">“Knowing Potat, she might try. She loves to rip up couches and chairs,” said Antaska.</p>
	<p class="block_19">“Oh, that’s OK,” said M. Hoyvil. “All the furniture is self-repairing.” </p>
	<p class="block_19">He palmed the door opener, and they went out and on their way.</p>
	<p class="block_19">On the way to class, M. Hoyvil thought about what had happened to Antaska in the gym. It didn’t escape his notice that she was probably interested in the un-Earthly attractive male trainer, but she was an adult of her species. The rules for the treatment of humans didn’t allow him to interfere with their mating behavior. He could give her advice, but he was sure that she would resent it. In any case, he really didn’t want to talk about it. </p>
	<p class="block_19">Still, he was worried. What if something worse happened next time? He didn’t know what he could actually do, but he was determined to protect her.</p>
