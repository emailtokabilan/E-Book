<h2 id="calibre_toc_11" class="calibre3">Chapter 5: Router</h2><p class="calibre1">Some years later, two men and a cat are tying one on in a bar that</p>
<p class="calibre1">doesn’t exist.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The air in the bar is filled with a billowing relativistic smoke cloud</p>
<p class="calibre1">- it’s a stellarium, accurately depicting the view beyond the</p>
<p class="calibre1">imaginary walls. Aberration of starlight skews the color toward violet</p>
<p class="calibre1">around the doorway, brightening in a rainbow mist over the tables,</p>
<p class="calibre1">then dimming to a hazy red glow in front of the raised platform at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">back. The Doppler effect has slowly emerged over the past few months</p>
<p class="calibre1">as the ship gathers momentum. In the absence of visible stellar motion</p>
<p class="calibre1">- or a hard link to the ship’s control module - it’s the easiest way</p>
<p class="calibre1">for a drunken passenger to get a feeling for how frighteningly fast</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Field Circus is moving. Some time ago, the ship’s momentum</p>
<p class="calibre1">exceeded half its rest mass, at which point a single kilogram packs</p>
<p class="calibre1">the punch of a multimegaton hydrogen bomb.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">A ginger-and-brown cat - who has chosen to be female, just to mess</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the heads of those people who think all ginger cats are male -</p>
<p class="calibre1">sprawls indolently across the wooden floorboards in front of the bar,</p>
<p class="calibre1">directly beneath the bridge of the starbow. Predictably, it has</p>
<p class="calibre1">captured the only ray of sunlight to be had within the starship. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">the shadows at the back of the bar, two men slump at a table, lost in</p>
<p class="calibre1">their respective morose thoughts: One nurses a bottle of Czech beer,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the other a half-empty cocktail glass.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It wouldn’t be so bad if she is giving me some sign,” says one of</p>
<p class="calibre1">them, tilting his beer bottle to inspect the bottom for sediment. “No;</p>
<p class="calibre1">that not right. It’s the correct kind of attention. Am not knowing</p>
<p class="calibre1">where I stand with her.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The other one leans back in his chair, squints at the faded brown</p>
<p class="calibre1">paint of the ceiling. “Take it from one who knows,” he says: “If you</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew, you’d have nothing to dream about. Anyway, what she wants and</p>
<p class="calibre1">what you want may not be the same thing.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first man runs a hand through his hair. Tight-curled black</p>
<p class="calibre1">ringlets briefly turn silver beneath his aging touch. “Pierre, if</p>
<p class="calibre1">talent for making patronizing statements is what you get from tupping</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre glares at him with all the venom an augmented nineteen-year-old</p>
<p class="calibre1">can muster. “Be glad she has no ears in here,” he hisses. His hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">tightens around his glass reflexively, but the physics model in force</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the bar refuses to let him break it. “You’ve had too fucking much</p>
<p class="calibre1">to drink, Boris.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">A tinkle of icy laughter comes from the direction of the cat. “Shut</p>
<p class="calibre1">up, you,” says Boris, glancing at the animal. He tips the bottle back,</p>
<p class="calibre1">lets the dregs trickle down his throat. “Maybe you’re right. Am sorry.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Do not mean to be rude about the queen.” He shrugs, puts the bottle</p>
<p class="calibre1">down. Shrugs again, heavily. “Am just getting depressed.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re good at that,” Pierre observes.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boris sighs again. “Evidently. If our positions are reversed -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know, I know, you’d be telling me the fun is in the chase and it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">not the same when she kicks you out after a fight, and I wouldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe a word of it, being sad and single and all that.” Pierre</p>
<p class="calibre1">snorts. “Life isn’t fair, Boris - live with it.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d better go - ” Boris stands.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stay away from Ang,” says Pierre, still annoyed with him. “At least</p>
<p class="calibre1">until you’re sober.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay already, stay cool; Am consciously running a watchdog thread.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Boris blinks irritably. “Enforcing social behavior. It doesn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">normally allow this drunk. Not where reputation damage are possible in</p>
<p class="calibre1">public.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He does a slow dissolve into thin air, leaving Pierre alone in the bar</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the cat.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How much longer do we have to put up with this shit?” he asks aloud.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tempers are frayed, and arguments proliferate indefinitely in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pocket universe of the ship.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat doesn’t look round. “In our current reference frame, we drop</p>
<p class="calibre1">the primary reflector and start decelerating in another two million</p>
<p class="calibre1">seconds,” she says. “Back home, five or six megaseconds.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s a big gap. What’s the cultural delta up to now?” Pierre asks</p>
<p class="calibre1">idly. He snaps his fingers: “Waiter, another cocktail. The same, if</p>
<p class="calibre1">you please.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, probably about ten to twenty times our departure reference,” says</p>
<p class="calibre1">the cat. “If you’d been following the news from back home, you’d have</p>
<p class="calibre1">noted a significant speed-up in the deployment of switched</p>
<p class="calibre1">entanglement routers. They’re having another networking revolution,</p>
<p class="calibre1">only this one will run to completion inside a month because they’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">using dark fiber that’s already in the ground.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Switched … entanglement?” Pierre shakes his head, bemused. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">waiter, a faceless body in black tie and a long, starched apron, walks</p>
<p class="calibre1">around the bar and offers him a glass. “That almost sounds as if it</p>
<p class="calibre1">makes sense. What else?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat rolls over on her flank, stretches, claws extended. “Stroke</p>
<p class="calibre1">me, and I might tell you,” she suggests.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fuck you, and the dog you rode in on,” Pierre replies. He lifts his</p>
<p class="calibre1">glass, removes a glac� cherry on a cocktail stick, throws it toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">the spiral staircase that leads down to the toilets, and chugs back</p>
<p class="calibre1">half of the drink in one go - freezing pink slush with an afterbite of</p>
<p class="calibre1">caramelized hexose sugars and ethanol. The near spillage as he thumps</p>
<p class="calibre1">the glass down serves to demonstrate that he’s teetering on the edge</p>
<p class="calibre1">of drunkenness. “Mercenary!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lovesick drug-using human,” the cat replies without rancor, and rolls</p>
<p class="calibre1">to her feet. She arches her back and yawns, baring ivory fangs at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world. “You apes - if I cared about you, I’d have to kick sand over</p>
<p class="calibre1">you.” For a moment she looks faintly confused. “I mean, I would bury</p>
<p class="calibre1">you.” She stretches again and glances round the otherwise-empty bar.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“By the way, when are you going to apologize to Amber?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not going to fucking apologize to her!” Pierre shouts. In the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ensuing silence and confusion, he raises his glass and tries to drain</p>
<p class="calibre1">it, but the ice has all sunk to the bottom, and the resulting coughing</p>
<p class="calibre1">fit makes him spray half of the cocktail across the table. “No way,”</p>
<p class="calibre1">he rasps quietly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Too much pride, huh?” The cat stalks toward the edge of the bar, tail</p>
<p class="calibre1">held high with tip bent over in a feline question mark. “Like Boris</p>
<p class="calibre1">with his adolescent woman trouble, too? You primates are so</p>
<p class="calibre1">predictable. Whoever thought of sending a starship crewed by posthuman</p>
<p class="calibre1">adolescents -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go ‘way,” says Pierre: “I’ve got serious drinking to do.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To the Macx, I suppose,” puns the cat, turning away. But the moody</p>
<p class="calibre1">youth has no answer for her, other than to conjure a refill from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">vasty deeps.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, in another partition of the Field Circus’s reticulated</p>
<p class="calibre1">reality, a different instance of the selfsame cat - Aineko by name,</p>
<p class="calibre1">sarcastic by disposition - is talking to its former owner’s daughter,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Queen of the Ring Imperium. Amber’s avatar looks about sixteen,</p>
<p class="calibre1">with disheveled blonde hair and enhanced cheekbones. It’s a lie, of</p>
<p class="calibre1">course, because in subjective life experience, she’s in her</p>
<p class="calibre1">mid-twenties, but apparent age signifies little in a simulation space</p>
<p class="calibre1">populated by upload minds, or in real space, where posthumans age at</p>
<p class="calibre1">different rates.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber wears a tattered black dress over iridescent purple leggings,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and sprawls lazily across the arms of her informal throne - an</p>
<p class="calibre1">ostentatious lump of nonsense manufactured from a single carbon</p>
<p class="calibre1">crystal doped with semiconductors. (Unlike the real thing back home in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jupiter orbit, this one is merely a piece of furniture for a virtual</p>
<p class="calibre1">environment.) The scene is very much the morning after the evening</p>
<p class="calibre1">before, like a goth nightclub gone to seed: all stale smoke and</p>
<p class="calibre1">crumpled velvet, wooden church pews, burned-out candles, and gloomy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Polish avant-garde paintings. Any hint of a regal statement the queen</p>
<p class="calibre1">might be making is spoiled by the way she’s hooked one knee over the</p>
<p class="calibre1">left arm of the throne and is fiddling with a six-axis pointing</p>
<p class="calibre1">device. But these are her private quarters, and she’s off duty: The</p>
<p class="calibre1">regal person of the Queen is strictly for formal, corporate occasions.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Colorless green ideas sleep furiously,” she suggests.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope,” replies the cat. “It was more like: ‘Greetings, earthlings,</p>
<p class="calibre1">compile me on your leader.’”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, you got me there,” Amber admits. She taps her heel on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">throne and fidgets with her signet ring. “No damn way I’m loading some</p>
<p class="calibre1">buggy alien wetware on my sweet gray stuff. Weird semiotics, too. What</p>
<p class="calibre1">does Dr. Khurasani say?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko sits down in the middle of the crimson carpet at the foot of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the dais and idly twists round to sniff her crotch. “Sadeq is immersed</p>
<p class="calibre1">in scriptural interpretations. He refused to be drawn.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh.” Amber stares at the cat. “So. You’ve been carrying this lump of</p>
<p class="calibre1">source code since when …?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At the signal, for precisely two hundred and sixteen million, four</p>
<p class="calibre1">hundred and twenty-nine thousand, and fifty-two seconds,” Aineko</p>
<p class="calibre1">supplies, then beeps smugly. “Call it just under six years.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right.” Amber squeezes her eyes shut. Uneasy possibilities whisper in</p>
<p class="calibre1">her mind’s ears. “And it began talking to you -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“- About three million seconds after I picked it up and ran it on a</p>
<p class="calibre1">basic environment hosted on a neural network emulator modeled on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">components found in the stomatogastric ganglion of a spiny lobster.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Clear?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber sighs. “I wish you’d told Dad about it. Or Annette. Things could</p>
<p class="calibre1">have been so different!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How?” The cat stops licking her arse and looks up at the queen with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">peculiarly opaque stare. “It took the specialists a decade to figure</p>
<p class="calibre1">out the first message was a map of the pulsar neighborhood with</p>
<p class="calibre1">directions to the nearest router on the interstellar network. Knowing</p>
<p class="calibre1">how to plug into the router wouldn’t help while it was three</p>
<p class="calibre1">light-years away, would it? Besides, it was fun watching the idiots</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying to ‘crack the alien code’ without ever wondering if it might be</p>
<p class="calibre1">a reply in a language we already know to a message we sent out years</p>
<p class="calibre1">ago. Fuckwits. And, too, Manfred pissed me off once too often. He kept</p>
<p class="calibre1">treating me like a goddamn house pet.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you -” Amber bites her lip. But you were, when he bought you, she</p>
<p class="calibre1">had been about to say. Engineered consciousness is still relatively</p>
<p class="calibre1">new: It didn’t exist when Manfred and Pamela first hacked on Aineko’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">cognitive network, and according to the flat-earth wing of the AI</p>
<p class="calibre1">community, it still doesn’t. Even she hadn’t really believed Aineko’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">claims to self-awareness until a couple of years ago, finding it</p>
<p class="calibre1">easier to think of the cat as a zimboe - a zombie with no</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-awareness, but programmed to claim to be aware in an attempt to</p>
<p class="calibre1">deceive the truly conscious beings around it. “I know you’re conscious</p>
<p class="calibre1">now, but Manfred didn’t know back then. Did he?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko glares at her, then slowly narrows her eyes to slits - either</p>
<p class="calibre1">feline affection, or a more subtle gesture. Sometimes Amber finds it</p>
<p class="calibre1">hard to believe that, twenty five years ago, Aineko started out as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">crude neural network driven toy from a Far Eastern amusement factory -</p>
<p class="calibre1">upgradeable, but still basically a mechanical animal emulator.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry. Let me start again. You actually figured out what the</p>
<p class="calibre1">second alien packet was, you, yourself, and nobody else. Despite the</p>
<p class="calibre1">combined efforts of the entire CETI analysis team who spent Gaia knows</p>
<p class="calibre1">how many human-equivalent years of processing power trying to crack</p>
<p class="calibre1">its semantics. I hope you’ll pardon me for saying I find that hard to</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat yawns. “I could have told Pierre instead.” Aineko glances at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber, sees her thunderous expression, and hastily changes the</p>
<p class="calibre1">subject: “The solution was intuitively obvious, just not to humans.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You’re so verbal.” Lifting a hind paw, she scratches behind her left</p>
<p class="calibre1">ear for a moment then pauses, foot waving absentmindedly. “Besides,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the CETI team was searching under the street lights while I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">sniffing around in the grass. They kept trying to find primes; when</p>
<p class="calibre1">that didn’t work, they started trying to breed a Turing machine that</p>
<p class="calibre1">would run it without immediately halting.” Aineko lowers her paw</p>
<p class="calibre1">daintily. “None of them tried treating it as a map of a connectionist</p>
<p class="calibre1">system based on the only terrestrial components anyone had ever beamed</p>
<p class="calibre1">out into deep space. Except me. But then, your mother had a hand in my</p>
<p class="calibre1">wetware, too.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Treating it as a map -” Amber stops. “You were meant to penetrate</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad’s corporate network?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s right,” says the cat. “I was supposed to fork repeatedly and</p>
<p class="calibre1">gang-rape his web of trust. But I didn’t.” Aineko yawns. “Pam pissed</p>
<p class="calibre1">me off, too. I don’t like people who try to use me.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t care. Taking that thing on board was still a really stupid</p>
<p class="calibre1">risk you took,” Amber accuses.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So?” The cat looks at her insolently. “I kept it in my sandbox. And I</p>
<p class="calibre1">got it working, on the seven hundred and forty-first attempt. It’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">have worked for Pamela’s bounty-hunter friends, too, if I’d tried it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But it’s here, now, when you need it. Would you like to swallow the</p>
<p class="calibre1">packet?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber straightens out, sits up in her throne: “I just told you, if you</p>
<p class="calibre1">think I’m going to link some flaky chunk of alien neural programming</p>
<p class="calibre1">into my core dialogue, or even my exocortex, you’re crazy!” Her eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">narrow. “Can it use your grammar model?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure.” If the cat was human, it would be shrugging nonchalantly at</p>
<p class="calibre1">this point. “It’s safe, Amber, really and truly. I found out what it</p>
<p class="calibre1">is.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I want to talk to it,” she says impetuously - and before the cat can</p>
<p class="calibre1">reply, adds, “So what is it?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s a protocol stack. Basically it allows new nodes to connect to a</p>
<p class="calibre1">network, by providing high-level protocol conversion services. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">needs to learn how to think like a human so it can translate for us</p>
<p class="calibre1">when we arrive at the router, which is why they bolted a lobster’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">neural network on top of it - they wanted to make it architecturally</p>
<p class="calibre1">compatible with us. But there are no buried time bombs, I assure you:</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve had plenty of time to check. Now, are you sure you don’t want to</p>
<p class="calibre1">let it into your head?”</p>

<p class="calibre1">Greetings from the fifth decade of the century of wonders.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The solar system that lies roughly twenty-eight trillion kilometers</p>
<p class="calibre1">- just short of three light-years - behind the speeding starwhisp</p>
<p class="calibre1">Field Circus is seething with change. There have been more</p>
<p class="calibre1">technological advances in the past ten years than in the entire</p>
<p class="calibre1">previous expanse of human history - and more unforeseen accidents.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lots of hard problems have proven to be tractable. The planetary</p>
<p class="calibre1">genome and proteome have been mapped so exhaustively that the</p>
<p class="calibre1">biosciences are now focusing on the challenge of the phenome:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Plotting the phase-space defined by the intersection of genes and</p>
<p class="calibre1">biochemical structures, understanding how extended phenotypic</p>
<p class="calibre1">traits are generated and contribute to evolutionary fitness. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">biosphere has become surreal: small dragons have been sighted</p>
<p class="calibre1">nesting in the Scottish highlands, and in the American midwest,</p>
<p class="calibre1">raccoons have been caught programming microwave ovens.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The computing power of the solar system is now around one thousand</p>
<p class="calibre1">MIPS per gram, and is unlikely to increase in the near term - all</p>
<p class="calibre1">but a fraction of one percent of the dumb matter is still locked up</p>
<p class="calibre1">below the accessible planetary crusts, and the sapience/mass ratio</p>
<p class="calibre1">has hit a glass ceiling that will only be broken when people,</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporations, or other posthumans get around to dismantling the</p>
<p class="calibre1">larger planets. A start has already been made in Jupiter orbit and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the asteroid belt. Greenpeace has sent squatters to occupy Eros and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Juno, but the average asteroid is now surrounded by a reef of</p>
<p class="calibre1">specialized nanomachinery and debris, victims of a cosmic land grab</p>
<p class="calibre1">unmatched since the days of the wild west. The best brains flourish</p>
<p class="calibre1">in free fall, minds surrounded by a sapient aether of extensions</p>
<p class="calibre1">that outthink their meaty cortices by many orders of magnitude -</p>
<p class="calibre1">minds like Amber, Queen of the Inner Ring Imperium, the first</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-extending power center in Jupiter orbit.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Down at the bottom of the terrestrial gravity well, there has been</p>
<p class="calibre1">a major economic catastrophe. Cheap immortagens, out-of-control</p>
<p class="calibre1">personality adjuvants, and a new formal theory of uncertainty have</p>

<p class="calibre1">previous generations had envisaged, the starship is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Coke-can-sized slab of nanocomputers, running a neural simulation</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ouch.” Pierre winces. The daily news from Earth, modulated onto a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lower-powered communication laser, is increasingly bad. On the plus</p>
<p class="calibre1">side, Amber is incredibly rich: The goodwill futures leveraged off her</p>
<p class="calibre1">dad’s trust metric means people will bend over backward to do things</p>
<p class="calibre1">for her. And she owns a lot of real estate too, a hundred gigatonnes</p>
<p class="calibre1">of rock in low-Jupiter orbit with enough KE to power Northern Europe</p>
<p class="calibre1">for a century. But her interstellar venture burns through money - both</p>
<p class="calibre1">the traditional barter-indirection type and the more creative modern</p>
<p class="calibre1">varieties - about the way you would if you heaped up the green pieces</p>
<p class="calibre1">of paper and shoveled them onto a conveyor belt leading to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">business end of a running rocket motor. Just holding off the</p>
<p class="calibre1">environmental protests over deorbiting a small Jovian moon is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">grinding job. Moreover, a whole bunch of national governments have</p>
<p class="calibre1">woken up and are trying to legislate themselves a slice of the cake.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nobody’s tried to forcibly take over yet (there are two hundred</p>
<p class="calibre1">gigawatts of lasers anchored to the Ring Imperium, and Amber takes her</p>
<p class="calibre1">sovereign status seriously, has even applied for a seat at the UN and</p>
<p class="calibre1">membership in the EC), but the nuisance lawsuits are mounting up into</p>
<p class="calibre1">a comprehensive denial of service attack, or maybe economic sanctions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And Uncle Gianni’s retirement hasn’t helped any, either. “Anything to</p>
<p class="calibre1">say about it?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mmph.” Ang looks irritated for some reason. “Wait your turn, they’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">be out of the buffer in another couple of days. Maybe a bit longer in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the case of the lawyer, he’s got a huge infodump packaged on his</p>

<p class="softbreak"> </p>

<p class="calibre1">“What, about the legal system here?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yup.” Pierre nods. “One of Amber’s smarter ideas, reviving</p>
<p class="calibre1">eleventh-century Scots law and updating it with new options on</p>
<p class="calibre1">barratry, trial by combat, and compurgation.” He pulls a face and</p>
<p class="calibre1">detaches a couple of ghosts to go look out for the new arrivals; then</p>
<p class="calibre1">he goes back to repairing sails. The interstellar medium is abrasive,</p>
<p class="calibre1">full of dust - each grain of which carries the energy of an artillery</p>
<p class="calibre1">shell at this speed - and the laser sail is in a constant state of</p>
<p class="calibre1">disintegration. A large chunk of the drive system’s mass is silvery</p>
<p class="calibre1">utility flakes for patching and replacing the soap-bubble-thin</p>
<p class="calibre1">membrane as it ablates away. The skill is in knowing how best to</p>
<p class="calibre1">funnel repair resources to where they’re needed, while minimizing</p>
<p class="calibre1">tension in the suspension lines and avoiding resonance and thrust</p>
<p class="calibre1">imbalance. As he trains the patch ‘bots, he broods about the hate mail</p>
<p class="calibre1">from his elder brother (who still blames him for their father’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">accident), and about Sadeq’s religious injunctions - Superstitious</p>
<p class="calibre1">nonsense, he thinks - and the fickleness of powerful women, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">endless depths of his own nineteen-year-old soul.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">While he’s brooding, Ang evidently finishes whatever she was doing and</p>
<p class="calibre1">bangs out - not even bothering to use the polished mahogany door at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the rear of the bridge, just discorporating and rematerializing</p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhere else. Wondering if she’s annoyed, he glances up just as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">first of his ghosts patches into his memory map, and he remembers what</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened when it met the new arrival. His eyes widen: “Oh shit!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s not the film producer but the lawyer who’s just uploaded into the</p>

<p class="calibre1">you’ve been distracted. Is there anything I can do to help?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen.” Pierre puts his hands on her shoulders. She doesn’t move,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but looks up into his eyes - Su Ang is only one-sixty tall - and he</p>
<p class="calibre1">feels a pang of something odd: teenage male uncertainty about the</p>
<p class="calibre1">friendship of women. What does she want? “I know, and I’m sorry, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ll try to keep my eyes on the ball some more, but I’ve been in my</p>
<p class="calibre1">own headspace a lot lately. We ought to go back into the audience</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you want to talk about the problem first?” she asks, inviting his</p>
<p class="calibre1">confidence.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I -” Pierre shakes his head. I could tell her everything, he realizes</p>
<p class="calibre1">shakily as his metaconscience prods him urgently. He’s got a couple of</p>
<p class="calibre1">agony-aunt agents, but Ang is a real person and a friend. She won’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">pass judgment, and her model of human social behavior is a hell of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lot better than any expert system’s. But time is in danger of</p>
<p class="calibre1">slipping, and besides, Pierre feels dirty. “Not now,” he says. “Let’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">go back.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.” She nods, then turns away, steps behind him with a swish of</p>

<p class="calibre1">conventional telescopes would have found it by direct observation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Only an infrared survey in the early years of the current century gave</p>
<p class="calibre1">it a name.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">A bunch of passengers and crew have gathered on the bridge (now</p>
<p class="calibre1">running at one-tenth of real time) to watch the arrival. Amber sits</p>
<p class="calibre1">curled up in the captain’s chair, moodily watching the gathered</p>
<p class="calibre1">avatars. Pierre is still avoiding her at every opportunity, formal</p>
<p class="calibre1">audiences excepted, and the damned shark and his pet hydra aren’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">invited, but apart from that, most of the gang is here. There are</p>
<p class="calibre1">sixty-three uploads running on the Field Circus’s virtualization</p>
<p class="calibre1">stack, software copied out of meatbodies who are mostly still walking</p>
<p class="calibre1">around back home. It’s a crowd, but it’s possible to feel lonely in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">crowd, even when it’s your party. And especially when you’re worried</p>
<p class="calibre1">about debt, even though you’re a billionairess, beneficiary of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">human species’ biggest reputations-rating trust fund. Amber’s clothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">- black leggings, black sweater - is as dark as her mood.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something troubles you.” A hand descends on the back of the chair</p>
<p class="calibre1">next to her.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She glances round momentarily, nods in recognition. “Yeah. Have a</p>
<p class="calibre1">seat. You missed the audience?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The thin, brown-skinned man with a neatly cropped beard and deeply</p>
<p class="calibre1">lined forehead slips into the seat next to her. “It was not part of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">heritage,” he explains carefully, “although the situation is not</p>
<p class="calibre1">unfamiliar.” A momentary smile threatens to crack his stony face. “I</p>
<p class="calibre1">found the casting a trifle disturbing.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m no Marguerite de Valois, but the vacant role … let’s just say,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the cap fits.” Amber leans back in her chair. “Mind you, Marguerite</p>
<p class="calibre1">had an interesting life,” she muses.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t you mean depraved and debauched?” her neighbor counters.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sadeq.” She closes her eyes. “Let’s not pick a fight over absolute</p>
<p class="calibre1">morality just right now, please? We have an orbital insertion to carry</p>
<p class="calibre1">out, then an artifact to locate, and a dialogue to open, and I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">feeling very tired. Drained.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah - I apologize.” He inclines his head carefully. “Is it your young</p>
<p class="calibre1">man’s fault? Has he slighted you?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not exactly -” Amber pauses. Sadeq, whom she basically invited along</p>
<p class="calibre1">as ship’s theologian in case they ran into any gods, has taken up her</p>
<p class="calibre1">pastoral well-being as some kind of hobby. She finds it mildly</p>
<p class="calibre1">oppressive at times, flattering at others, surreal always. Using the</p>
<p class="calibre1">quantum search resources available to a citizen of the Ring Imperium,</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’s outpublished his peers, been elected a hojetolislam at an</p>
<p class="calibre1">unprecedentedly young age: His original will probably be an ayatollah</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the time they get home. He’s circumspect in dealing with cultural</p>
<p class="calibre1">differences, reasons with impeccable logic, carefully avoids</p>
<p class="calibre1">antagonizing her - and constantly seeks to guide her moral</p>
<p class="calibre1">development. “It’s a personal misunderstanding,” she says. “I’d rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">not talk about it until we’ve sorted it out.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very well.” He looks unsatisfied, but that’s normal. Sadeq still has</p>
<p class="calibre1">the dusty soil of a childhood in the industrial city of Yazd stuck to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his boots. Sometimes she wonders if their disagreements don’t mirror</p>
<p class="calibre1">in miniature the gap between the early twentieth and early</p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty-first centuries. “But back to the here and now. Do you know</p>
<p class="calibre1">where this router is?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I will, in a few minutes or hours.” Amber raises her voice,</p>
<p class="calibre1">simultaneously spawning a number of search-ghosts. “Boris! You got any</p>
<p class="calibre1">idea where we’re going?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boris lumbers round in place to face her; today he’s wearing a</p>
<p class="calibre1">velociraptor, and they don’t turn easily in confined spaces. He snarls</p>
<p class="calibre1">irritably: “Give me some space!” He coughs, a threatening noise from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the back of his wattled throat, “Searching the sail’s memory now.” The</p>
<p class="calibre1">back of the soap-bubble-thin laser sail is saturated with tiny</p>
<p class="calibre1">nanocomputers spaced micrometers apart. Equipped with light receptors</p>
<p class="calibre1">and configured as cellular automata, they form a gigantic phased-array</p>
<p class="calibre1">detector, a retina more than a hundred meters in diameter. Boris is</p>
<p class="calibre1">feeding them patterns describing anything that differs from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">unchanging starscape. Soon the memories will condense and return as</p>
<p class="calibre1">visions of darkness in motion - the cold, dead attendants of an</p>
<p class="calibre1">aborted sun.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But where is it going to be?” asks Sadeq. “Do you know what you are</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking for?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. We should have no trouble finding it,” says Amber. “It looks</p>
<p class="calibre1">like this.” She flicks an index finger at the row of glass windows</p>
<p class="calibre1">that front the bridge. Her signet ring flashes ruby light, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">something indescribably weird shimmers into view in place of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">seascape. Clusters of pearly beads that form helical chains, disks and</p>
<p class="calibre1">whorls of color that interlace and knot through one another, hang in</p>
<p class="calibre1">space above a darkling planet. “Looks like a William Latham sculpture</p>
<p class="calibre1">made out of strange matter, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very abstract,” Sadeq says approvingly.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s alive,” she adds. “And when it gets close enough to see us,</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’ll try to eat us.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” Sadeq sits up uneasily.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You mean nobody told you?” asks Amber: “I thought we’d briefed</p>
<p class="calibre1">everybody.” She throws a glistening golden pomegranate at him, and he</p>
<p class="calibre1">catches it. The apple of knowledge dissolves in his hand, and he sits</p>
<p class="calibre1">in a haze of ghosts absorbing information on his behalf. “Damn,” she</p>
<p class="calibre1">adds mildly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sadeq freezes in place. Glyphs of crumbling stonework overgrown with</p>
<p class="calibre1">ivy texture his skin and his dark suit, warning that he’s busy in</p>
<p class="calibre1">another private universe.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hrrrr! Boss! Found something,” calls Boris, drooling on the bridge</p>
<p class="calibre1">floor.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber glances up. Please, let it be the router, she thinks. “Put it on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the main screen.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you sure this is safe?” Su Ang asks nervously.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing is safe,” Boris snaps, clattering his huge claws on the deck.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here. Look.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The view beyond the windows flips to a perspective on a dusty bluish</p>
<p class="calibre1">horizon: swirls of hydrogen brushed with a high cirrus of white</p>
<p class="calibre1">methane crystals, stirred above the freezing point of oxygen by</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hyundai +4904/[-56]‘s residual rotation. The image-intensification</p>
<p class="calibre1">level is huge - a naked human eyeball would see nothing but blackness.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rising above the limb of the gigantic planet is a small pale disk:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Callidice, largest moon of the brown dwarf - or second-innermost</p>
<p class="calibre1">planet - a barren rock slightly larger than Mercury. The screen zooms</p>
<p class="calibre1">in on the moon, surging across a landscape battered by craters and</p>
<p class="calibre1">dusted with the spume of ice volcanoes. Finally, just above the far</p>
<p class="calibre1">horizon, something turquoise shimmers and spins against a backdrop of</p>
<p class="calibre1">frigid darkness.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s it,” Amber whispers, her stomach turning to jelly as all the</p>
<p class="calibre1">terrible might-have-beens dissolve like phantoms of the night around</p>
<p class="calibre1">her; “That’s it!” Elated, she stands up, wanting to share the moment</p>
<p class="calibre1">with everybody she values. “Wake up, Sadeq! Someone get that damned</p>
<p class="calibre1">cat in here! Where’s Pierre? He’s got to see this!”</p>

<p class="calibre1">Night and revelry rule outside the castle. The crowds are drunken and</p>
<p class="calibre1">rowdy on the eve of the St. Bartholomew’s Day massacre. Fireworks</p>
<p class="calibre1">burst overhead, and the open windows admit a warm breeze redolent of</p>
<p class="calibre1">cooked meats, woodsmoke, open sewers. Meanwhile a lover steals up a</p>
<p class="calibre1">tightly-spiraling stone staircase in the near dark; his goal, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">prarranged rendezvous. He’s been drinking, and his best linen shirt</p>
<p class="calibre1">shows the stains of sweat and food. He pauses at the third window to</p>
<p class="calibre1">breathe in the outside air and run both hands through his mane of</p>
<p class="calibre1">hair, which is long, unkempt, and grimy. Why am I doing this? he</p>
<p class="calibre1">wonders. This is so unlike him, this messing around -</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He carries on up the spiral. At the top, an oak door gapes on a</p>
<p class="calibre1">vestibule lit by a lantern hanging from a hook. He ventures inside</p>
<p class="calibre1">into a reception room paneled in oak blackened by age. Crossing the</p>
<p class="calibre1">threshold makes another crossover kick in by prior arrangement.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Something other than his own volition steers his feet, and he feels an</p>
<p class="calibre1">unfamiliar throb in his chest, anticipation and a warmth and looseness</p>
<p class="calibre1">lower down that makes him cry out, “where are you?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Over here.” He sees her waiting for him in the doorway. She’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">partially undressed, wearing layered underskirts and a flat-chested</p>
<p class="calibre1">corset that makes the tops of her breasts swell like lustrous domes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her tight sleeves are half-unraveled, her hair disheveled. He’s full</p>
<p class="calibre1">of her brilliant eyes, the constriction holding her spine straight,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the taste in her mouth. She’s the magnet for his reality, impossibly</p>
<p class="calibre1">alluring, so tense she could burst. “Is it working for you?” she asks.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” he feels tight, breathless, squeezed between impossibility and</p>
<p class="calibre1">desire as he walks toward her. They’ve experimented with gender play,</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying on the extreme dimorphism of this period as a game, but this is</p>
<p class="calibre1">the first time they’ve done it this way. She opens her mouth: He</p>
<p class="calibre1">kisses her, feels the warmth of his tongue thrust between her lips,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the strength of his arms enclosing her waist.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She leans against him, feeling his erection. “So this is how it feels</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be you,” she says wonderingly. The door to her chamber is ajar, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">she doesn’t have the self-restraint to wait: The flood of new</p>
<p class="calibre1">sensations - rerouted from her physiology model to his proprioceptive</p>
<p class="calibre1">sensorium - has taken hold. She grinds her hips against him, pushing</p>
<p class="calibre1">deeper into his arms, whining softly at the back of her throat as she</p>
<p class="calibre1">feels the fullness in his balls, the tension of his penis. He nearly</p>
<p class="calibre1">faints with the rich sensations of her body - it’s as if he’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">dissolving, feeling the throbbing hardness against his groin, turning</p>
<p class="calibre1">to water and running away. Somehow he gets his arms around her waist -</p>
<p class="calibre1">so tight, so breathless - and stumbles forward into the bedroom. She’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">whimpering as he drops her on the over-stuffed mattress: “Do it to</p>
<p class="calibre1">me!” she demands, “Do it now!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow he ends up on top of her, hose down around his ankles, skirts</p>
<p class="calibre1">bundled up around her waist; she kisses him, grinding her hips against</p>
<p class="calibre1">him and murmuring urgent nothings. Then his heart is in his mouth, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">there’s a sensation like the universe pushing into his private parts,</p>
<p class="calibre1">so inside out it takes his breath away. It’s hot and as hard as rock,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and he wants it inside so badly, but at the same time it’s an</p>
<p class="calibre1">intrusion, frightening and unexpected. He feels the lightning touch of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his tongue on her nipples as he leans closer, feels exposed and</p>
<p class="calibre1">terrified and ecstatic as her private places take in his member. As he</p>
<p class="calibre1">begins to dissolve into the universe he screams in the privacy of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">own head, I didn’t know it felt like this -</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Afterward, she turns to him with a lazy smile, and asks, “How was it</p>
<p class="calibre1">for you?” Obviously assuming that, if she enjoyed it, he must have,</p>
<p class="calibre1">too.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But all he can think of is the sensation of the universe thrusting</p>
<p class="calibre1">into him, and of how good it felt. All he can hear is his father</p>
<p class="calibre1">yelling (“What are you, some kind of queer?”) - and he feels dirty.</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boris, in human drag, for once, glares at Pierre, and grips the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pitcher with both hands. The contents of the jug swirl their tentacles</p>
<p class="calibre1">lazily: One of them flips almost out of solution, dislodging an</p>
<p class="calibre1">impaled cocktail cherry. “Will get you for this,” Boris threatens. The</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Su Ang stares intently at Pierre who is watching Boris as he raises</p>
<p class="calibre1">the jug to his lips and begins to drink. The baby jellyfish - small,</p>
<p class="calibre1">pale blue, with cuboid bells and four clusters of tentacles trailing</p>
<p class="calibre1">from each corner - slips down easily. Boris winces momentarily as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">nematocysts let rip inside his mouth, but in a moment or so, the</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fuck the trial,” Pierre says shortly. And fuck Amber, too, for naming</p>
<p class="calibre1">me her public defender -</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Since when do lawsuits come with an invisible man?” asks Donna the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Journalist, blitting into the bar along with a patchy historical trail</p>
<p class="calibre1">hinting that she’s just come from the back room.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Since -” Pierre blinks. “Hell.” When Donna entered, so did Aineko; or</p>
<p class="calibre1">maybe the cat’s been there all the time, curled up loaf-of-bread</p>
<p class="calibre1">fashion on the table in front of the wicker man. “You’re damaging the</p>
<p class="calibre1">continuity,” Pierre complains. “This universe is broken.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fix it yourself,” Boris tells him. “Everybody else is coping.” He</p>
<p class="calibre1">snaps his fingers. “Waiter!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse me.” Donna shakes her head. “I didn’t mean to harm anything.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ang, as always, is more accommodating. “How are you?” she asks</p>
<p class="calibre1">politely: “Would you like to try this most excellent poison cocktail?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am well,” says Donna. A heavily built German woman - blonde and</p>
<p class="calibre1">solidly muscular, according to the avatar she’s presenting to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">public - she’s surrounded by a haze of viewpoints. They’re camera</p>
<p class="calibre1">angles on her society of mind, busily integrating and splicing her</p>
<p class="calibre1">viewpoint threads together in an endless journal of the journey. A</p>
<p class="calibre1">stringer for the CIA media consortium, she uploaded to the ship in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same packet stream as the lawsuit. “Danke, Ang.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you recording right now?” asks Boris.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Donna sniffs. “When am I not?” A momentary smile: “I am only a</p>
<p class="calibre1">scanner, no? Five hours, until arrival, to go. I may stop after then.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre glances across the table at Su Ang’s hands; her knuckles are</p>
<p class="calibre1">white and tense. “I am to avoid missing anything if possible,” Donna</p>
<p class="calibre1">continues, oblivious to Ang’s disquiet. “There are eight of me at</p>
<p class="calibre1">present! All recording away.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s all?” Ang asks, raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, that is all, and I have a job to do! Don’t tell me you do not</p>
<p class="calibre1">enjoy what it is that you do here?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right.” Pierre glances in the corner again, avoiding eye contact with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the hearty Girl Friday wannabe. He has a feeling, that if there were</p>
<p class="calibre1">any hills hereabouts to animate, she’d be belting out the music.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Amber told you about the privacy code here?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There is a privacy code?” asks Donna, swinging at least three</p>
<p class="calibre1">subjective ghosts to bear on him for some reason - evidently he’s hit</p>
<p class="calibre1">an issue she has mixed feelings about.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A privacy code,” Pierre confirms. “No recording in private, no</p>
<p class="calibre1">recording where people withhold permission in public, and no sandboxes</p>
<p class="calibre1">and cutups.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Donna looks offended. “I would never do such a thing! Trapping a copy</p>
<p class="calibre1">of someone in a virtual space to record their responses would be</p>
<p class="calibre1">assault under Ring legal code, not true?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your mother,” Boris says snidely, brandishing a fresh jug of iced</p>
<p class="calibre1">killer jellyfish in her direction.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As long as we all agree,” Ang interrupts, searching for accord. “It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">all going to be settled soon, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Except for the lawsuit,” mutters Pierre, glancing at the corner</p>
<p class="calibre1">again.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t see the problem,” says Donna, “that’s just between Amber and</p>
<p class="calibre1">her downlink adversaries!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, it’s a problem all right,” says Boris, his tone light. “What are</p>
<p class="calibre1">your options worth?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My -” Donna shakes her head. “I’m not vested.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Plausible.” Boris doesn’t crack a smile. “Even so, when we go home,</p>
<p class="calibre1">your credibility metric will bulge. Assuming people still use</p>
<p class="calibre1">distributed trust markets to evaluate the stability of their business</p>
<p class="calibre1">partners.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not vested. Pierre turns it over in his mind, slightly surprised. He’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">assumed that everybody aboard the ship - except, perhaps, the lawyer,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Glashwiecz - was a fully vested member of the expeditionary company.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am not vested,” Donna insists. “I’m listed independently.” For a</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment, an almost-smile tugs at her face, a charmingly reticent</p>
<p class="calibre1">expression that has nothing to do with her bluff exterior. “Like the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cat.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The -” Pierre turns round in a hurry. Yes, Aineko appears to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">sitting silently at the table with the wicker man; but who knows</p>
<p class="calibre1">what’s going through that furry head right now? I’ll have to bring</p>
<p class="calibre1">this up with Amber, he realizes uneasily. I ought to bring this up</p>
<p class="calibre1">with Amber … “but your reputation won’t suffer for being on this</p>
<p class="calibre1">craft, will it?” he asks aloud.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I will be all right,” Donna declares. The waiter comes over: “Mine</p>
<p class="calibre1">will be a bottle of schneiderweisse,” she adds. And then, without</p>
<p class="calibre1">breaking step: “Do you believe in the singularity?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Am I a singularitarian, do you mean?” asks Pierre, a fixed grin</p>
<p class="calibre1">coming to his face.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, no, no, no!” Donna waves him down, grins broadly, nods at Su Ang:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I do not mean it like that! Attend: What I meant to ask was whether</p>
<p class="calibre1">you in the concept of a singularity believe, and if so, where it is?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is this intended for a public interview?” asks Ang.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I cannot into a simulation drag you off and expose you to an</p>
<p class="calibre1">imitative reality excursion, can I?” Donna leans back as the bartender</p>
<p class="calibre1">places a ceramic stein in front of her.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh. Well.” Ang glances warningly at Pierre and dispatches a very</p>
<p class="calibre1">private memo to scroll across his vision: Don’t play with her, this is</p>
<p class="calibre1">serious. Boris is watching Ang with an expression of hopeless longing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre tries to ignore it all, taking the journalist’s question</p>
<p class="calibre1">seriously. “The singularity is a bit like that old-time American</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christian rapture nonsense, isn’t it?” he says. “When we all go</p>
<p class="calibre1">a-flying up to heaven, leaving our bodies behind.” He snorts, reaches</p>
<p class="calibre1">into thin air and gratuitously violates causality by summoning a jug</p>
<p class="calibre1">of ice-cold sangria into existence. “The rapture of the nerds. I’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">drink to that.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But when did it take place?” asks Donna. “My audience, they will to</p>
<p class="calibre1">know your opinion be needing.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Four years ago, when we instantiated this ship,” Pierre says</p>
<p class="calibre1">promptly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Back in the teens,” says Ang. “When Amber’s father liberated the</p>
<p class="calibre1">uploaded lobsters.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is not happening yet,” contributes Boris. “Singularity implies</p>
<p class="calibre1">infinite rate of change achieved momentarily. Future not amenable</p>
<p class="calibre1">thereafter to prediction by presingularity beings, right? So has not</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Au contraire. It happened on June 6th, 1969, at eleven hundred hours,</p>
<p class="calibre1">eastern seaboard time,” Pierre counters. “That was when the first</p>
<p class="calibre1">network control protocol packets were sent from the data port of one</p>
<p class="calibre1">IMP to another - the first ever Internet connection. That’s the</p>
<p class="calibre1">singularity. Since then we’ve all been living in a universe that was</p>
<p class="calibre1">impossible to predict from events prior to that time.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s rubbish,” counters Boris. “Singularity is load of religious</p>
<p class="calibre1">junk. Christian mystic rapture recycled for atheist nerds.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not so.” Su Ang glances at him, hurt. “Here we are, sixty something</p>
<p class="calibre1">human minds. We’ve been migrated - while still awake - right out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">our own heads using an amazing combination of nanotechnology and</p>
<p class="calibre1">electron spin resonance mapping, and we’re now running as software in</p>
<p class="calibre1">an operating system designed to virtualize multiple physics models and</p>
<p class="calibre1">provide a simulation of reality that doesn’t let us go mad from</p>
<p class="calibre1">sensory deprivation! And this whole package is about the size of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fingertip, crammed into a starship the size of your grandmother’s old</p>
<p class="calibre1">Walkman, in orbit around a brown dwarf just over three light-years</p>
<p class="calibre1">from home, on its way to plug into a network router created by</p>
<p class="calibre1">incredibly ancient alien intelligences, and you can tell me that the</p>
<p class="calibre1">idea of a fundamental change in the human condition is nonsense?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mmph.” Boris looks perplexed. “Would not put it that way. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">singularity is nonsense, not uploading or -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yah, right.” Ang smiles winningly at Boris. After a moment, he wilts.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Donna beams at them enthusiastically. “Fascinating!” she enthuses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell me, what are these lobsters you think are important?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re Amber’s friends,” Ang explains. “Years ago, Amber’s father</p>
<p class="calibre1">did a deal with them. They were the first uploads, you know?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hybridized spiny lobster neural tissue and a heuristic API and some</p>
<p class="calibre1">random mess of backward-chaining expert systems. They got out of their</p>
<p class="calibre1">lab and into the Net and Manfred brokered a deal to set them free, in</p>
<p class="calibre1">return for their help running a Franklin orbital factory. This was way</p>
<p class="calibre1">back in the early days before they figured out how to do self-assembly</p>
<p class="calibre1">properly. Anyway, the lobsters insisted - part of their contract -</p>
<p class="calibre1">that Bob Franklin pay to have the deep-space tracking network beam</p>
<p class="calibre1">them out into interstellar space. They wanted to emigrate, and looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">at what’s happened to the solar system since then, who can blame</p>
<p class="calibre1">them?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre takes a big mouthful of sangria. “The cat,” he says.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The cat -” Donna’s head swivels round, but Aineko has banged out</p>
<p class="calibre1">again, retroactively editing her presence out of the event history of</p>
<p class="calibre1">this public space. “What about the cat?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The family cat,” explains Ang. She reaches over for Boris’s pitcher</p>
<p class="calibre1">of jellyfish juice, but frowns as she does so: “Aineko wasn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">conscious back then, but later … when SETI@home finally received</p>
<p class="calibre1">that message back, oh, however many years ago, Aineko remembered the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lobsters. And cracked it wide open while all the CETI teams were still</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking in terms of von Neumann architectures and concept-oriented</p>
<p class="calibre1">programming. The message was a semantic net designed to mesh perfectly</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the lobster broadcast all those years ago, and provide a</p>
<p class="calibre1">high-level interface to a communications network we’re going to</p>
<p class="calibre1">visit.” She squeezes Boris’s fingertips. “SETI@home logged these</p>
<p class="calibre1">coordinates as the origin of the transmission, even though the public</p>
<p class="calibre1">word was that the message came from a whole lot farther away - they</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t want to risk a panic if people knew there were aliens on our</p>
<p class="calibre1">cosmic doorstep. Anyway, once Amber got established, she decided to</p>
<p class="calibre1">come visiting. Hence this expedition. Aineko created a virtual lobster</p>
<p class="calibre1">and interrogated the ET packet, hence the communications channel we’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">about to open.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, this is all a bit clearer now,” says Donna. “But the lawsuit - “</p>
<p class="calibre1">She glances at the hollow wicker man in the corner.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, there we have a problem,” Ang says diplomatically.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” says Pierre. “I have a problem. And it’s all Amber’s fault.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm?” Donna stares at him. “Why blame the Queen?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because she’s the one who picked the lunar month to be the reporting</p>
<p class="calibre1">time period for companies in her domain, and specified trial by combat</p>
<p class="calibre1">for resolving corporate conflicts,” he grumbles. “And compurgation,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but that’s not applicable to this case because there isn’t a</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognized reputation server within three light-years. Trial by</p>
<p class="calibre1">combat, for civil suits in this day and age! And she appointed me her</p>
<p class="calibre1">champion.” In the most traditional way imaginable, he remembers with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">warm frisson of nostalgia. He’d been hers in body and soul before that</p>
<p class="calibre1">disastrous experiment. He isn’t sure whether it still applies, but -</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve got to take on this lawsuit on her behalf, in adversarial</p>
<p class="calibre1">stance.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He glances over his shoulder. The wicker man sits there placidly,</p>
<p class="calibre1">pouring beer down his invisible throat like a tired farm laborer.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Trial by combat,” Su Ang explains to Donna’s perplexed ghost-swarm,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which is crawling all over the new concept in a haze of confusion.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not physical combat, but a competition of ability. It seemed like a</p>
<p class="calibre1">good idea at the time, to keep junk litigants out of the Ring</p>
<p class="calibre1">Imperium, but the Queen Mother’s lawyers are very persistent. Probably</p>
<p class="calibre1">because it’s taken on something of a grudge match quality over the</p>
<p class="calibre1">years. I don’t think Pamela cares much anymore, but this ass-hat</p>
<p class="calibre1">lawyer has turned it into a personal crusade. I don’t think he liked</p>
<p class="calibre1">what happened when the music Mafiya caught up with him. But there’s a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bit more to it, because if he wins, he gets to own everything. And I</p>
<p class="calibre1">mean everything.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ten million kilometers out and Hyundai +4904/[-56] looms beyond the</p>
<p class="calibre1">parachute-shaped sail of the Field Circus like a rind of darkness</p>
<p class="calibre1">bitten out of the edge of the universe. Heat from the gravitational</p>
<p class="calibre1">contraction of its core keeps it warm, radiating at six hundred</p>
<p class="calibre1">degrees absolute, but the paltry emission does nothing to break the</p>
<p class="calibre1">eternal ice that grips Callidice, Iambe, Celeus, and Metaneira, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">stillborn planets locked in orbit around the brown dwarf.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Planets aren’t the only structures that orbit the massive sphere of</p>
<p class="calibre1">hydrogen. Close in, skimming the cloud tops by only twenty thousand</p>
<p class="calibre1">kilometers, Boris’s phased-array eye has blinked at something metallic</p>
<p class="calibre1">and hot. Whatever it is, it orbits out of the ecliptic plane traced by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the icy moons, and in the wrong direction. Farther out, a speckle of</p>
<p class="calibre1">reflected emerald laser light picks out a gaudy gem against the</p>
<p class="calibre1">starscape: their destination, the router.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s it,” says Boris. His body shimmers into humanity, retconning</p>
<p class="calibre1">the pocket universe of the bridge into agreeing that he’s been present</p>
<p class="calibre1">in primate form all along. Amber glances sideways. Sadeq is still</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrapped in ivy, his skin the texture of weathered limestone. “Closest</p>
<p class="calibre1">approach is sixty-three light-seconds, due in eight hundred thousand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Can give you closer contact if we maneuver, but will take time to</p>
<p class="calibre1">achieve a stable orbit.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber nods thoughtfully, sending copies of herself out to work the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mechanics. The big light sail is unwieldy, but can take advantage of</p>
<p class="calibre1">two power sources: the original laser beam from Jupiter, and its</p>
<p class="calibre1">reflection bouncing off the now-distant primary light sail. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">temptation is to rely on the laser for constant acceleration, to just</p>
<p class="calibre1">motor on in and squat on the router’s cosmic doorstep. But the risk of</p>
<p class="calibre1">beam interruption is too dangerous. It’s happened before, for seconds</p>
<p class="calibre1">to minutes at a time, on six occasions during the voyage so far. She’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">not sure what causes the beam downtime (Pierre has a theory about Oort</p>
<p class="calibre1">cloud objects occulting the laser, but she figures it’s more likely to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be power cuts back at the Ring), but the consequences of losing power</p>
<p class="calibre1">while maneuvering deep in a quasi-stellar gravity well are much more</p>
<p class="calibre1">serious than a transient loss of thrust during free interstellar</p>
<p class="calibre1">flight. “Let’s just play it safe,” she says. “We’ll go for a straight</p>
<p class="calibre1">orbital insertion and steady cranking after that. We’ve got enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">gravity wells to play pinball with. I don’t want us on a free-flight</p>
<p class="calibre1">trajectory that entails lithobraking if we lose power and can’t get</p>
<p class="calibre1">the sail back.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very prudent,” Boris agrees. “Marta, work on it.” A buzzing presence</p>
<p class="calibre1">of not-insects indicates that the heteromorphic helmswoman is on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">job. “I think we should be able to take our first close-in look in</p>
<p class="calibre1">about two million seconds, but if you want, I can ping it now …?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No need for protocol analysis,” Amber says casually. “Where’s - ah,</p>
<p class="calibre1">there you are.” She reaches down and picks up Aineko, who twists round</p>
<p class="calibre1">sinuously and licks her arm with a tongue like sandpaper. “What do you</p>
<p class="calibre1">think?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you want fries with that?” asks the cat, focusing on the artifact</p>
<p class="calibre1">at the center of the main screen in front of the bridge.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I just want a conversation,” says Amber.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, okay.” The cat dims, moves jerkily, sucking up local processing</p>
<p class="calibre1">power so fast that it disturbs the local physics model. “Opening port</p>
<p class="calibre1">now.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">A subjective minute or two passes. “Where’s Pierre?” Amber asks</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself quietly. Some of the maintenance metrics she can read from her</p>
<p class="calibre1">privileged viewpoint are worrying. The Field Circus is running at</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost eighty percent of utilization. Whatever Aineko is doing in</p>
<p class="calibre1">order to establish the interface to the router, it’s taking up an</p>
<p class="calibre1">awful lot of processing power and bandwidth. “And where’s the bloody</p>
<p class="calibre1">lawyer?” she adds, almost as an afterthought.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Field Circus is small, but its light sail is highly controllable.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko takes over a cluster of cells in its surface, turning them from</p>
<p class="calibre1">straight reflectors into phase-conjugate mirrors: A small laser on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ship’s hull begins to flicker thousands of times a second, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">beam bounces off the modified segment of mirror, focusing to a</p>
<p class="calibre1">coherent point right in front of the distant blue dot of the router.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko ramps up the modulation frequency, adds a bundle of channels</p>
<p class="calibre1">using different wavelengths, and starts feeding out a complex set of</p>
<p class="calibre1">preplanned signals that provide an encoding format for high-level</p>
<p class="calibre1">data.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Leave the lawyer to me.” She starts, glancing sideways to see Sadeq</p>
<p class="calibre1">watching her. He smiles without showing his teeth. “Lawyers do not mix</p>
<p class="calibre1">with diplomacy,” he explains.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh.” Ahead of them, the router is expanding. Strings of nacreous</p>
<p class="calibre1">spheres curl in strange loops around a hidden core, expanding and</p>
<p class="calibre1">turning inside out in systolic pulses that spawn waves of</p>
<p class="calibre1">recomplication through the structure. A loose red speckle of laser</p>
<p class="calibre1">light stains one arm of beads; suddenly it flares up brilliantly,</p>
<p class="calibre1">reflecting data back at the ship. “Ah!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Contact,” purrs the cat. Amber’s fingertips turn white where she</p>
<p class="calibre1">grips the arms of her chair.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What does it say?” she asks, quietly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do they say,” corrects Aineko. “It’s a trade delegation, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’re uploading right now. I can use that negotiation network they</p>
<p class="calibre1">sent us to give them an interface to our systems if you want.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait!” Amber half stands in sudden nervousness. “Don’t give them free</p>
<p class="calibre1">access! What are you thinking of? Stick them in the throne room, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">we’ll give them a formal audience in a couple of hours.” She pauses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“That network layer they sent through. Can you make it accessible to</p>
<p class="calibre1">us, use it to give us a translation layer into their grammar-mapping</p>
<p class="calibre1">system?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat looks round, thumps her tail irritably: “You’d do better</p>
<p class="calibre1">loading the network yourself -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t want anybody on this ship running alien code before we’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">vetted it thoroughly,” she says urgently. “In fact, I want them</p>
<p class="calibre1">bottled up in the Louvre grounds, just as thoroughly as we can, and I</p>
<p class="calibre1">want them to come to us through our own linguistic bottleneck. Got</p>
<p class="calibre1">that?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Clear,” Aineko grumbles.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A trade delegation,” Amber thinks aloud. “What would Dad make of</p>
<p class="calibre1">that?”</p>

<p class="calibre1">One moment he’s in the bar, shooting bull with Su Ang and Donna the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Journalist’s ghost and a copy of Boris; the next he’s abruptly</p>
<p class="calibre1">precipitated into a very different space.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre’s heart seems to tumble within his rib cage, but he forces</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself to stay calm as he glances around the dim, oak-paneled</p>
<p class="calibre1">chamber. This is wrong, so wrong that it signifies either a major</p>
<p class="calibre1">systems crash or the application of frightening privilege levels to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his realm. The only person aboard who’s entitled to those privileges</p>
<p class="calibre1">is -</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pierre?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’s behind him. He turns angrily. “Why did you drag me in here?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Don’t you know it’s rude to -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pierre.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He stops and looks at Amber. He can’t stay angry at her for long, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">to her face. She’s not dumb enough to bat her eyelashes at him, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">she’s disarmingly cute for all that. Nevertheless, something inside</p>
<p class="calibre1">him feels shriveled and wrong in her presence. “What is it?” he says,</p>
<p class="calibre1">curtly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know why you’ve been avoiding me.” She starts to take a step</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward, then stops and bites her lip. Don’t do this to me! he thinks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know it hurts?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” That much of an admission hurts him, too. He can hear his</p>
<p class="calibre1">father yelling over his shoulder, the time he found him with Laurent,</p>
<p class="calibre1">elder brother: It’s a choice between p�re or Amber, but it’s not a</p>
<p class="calibre1">choice he wants to make. The shame. “I didn’t - I have some issues.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was the other night?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He nods. Now she takes a step forwards. “We can talk about it, if you</p>
<p class="calibre1">want. Whatever you want,” she says. And she leans toward him, and he</p>
<p class="calibre1">feels his resistance crumbling. He reaches out and hugs her, and she</p>
<p class="calibre1">wraps her arms around him and leans her chin on his shoulder, and this</p>
<p class="calibre1">doesn’t feel wrong: How can anything this good be bad?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It made me uncomfortable,” he mumbles into her hair. “Need to sort</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself out.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, Pierre.” She strokes the down at the back of his neck. “You</p>
<p class="calibre1">should have said. We don’t have to do it that way if you don’t want</p>
<p class="calibre1">to.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">How to tell her how hard it is to admit that anything’s wrong? Ever?</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You didn’t drag me here to tell me that,” he says, implicitly</p>
<p class="calibre1">changing the subject.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber lets go of him, backs away almost warily. “What is it?” she</p>
<p class="calibre1">asks.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something’s wrong?” he half asks, half asserts. “Have we made contact</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” she says, pulling a face. “There’s an alien trade delegation</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the Louvre. That’s the problem.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An alien trade delegation.” He rolls the words around the inside of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his mouth, tasting them. They feel paradoxical, cold and slow after</p>
<p class="calibre1">the hot words of passion he’s been trying to avoid uttering. It’s his</p>
<p class="calibre1">fault for changing the subject.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A trade delegation,” says Amber. “I should have anticipated. I mean,</p>
<p class="calibre1">we were going to go through the router ourselves, weren’t we?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He sighs. “We thought we were going to do that.” A quick prod at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">universe’s controls determines that he has certain capabilities: He</p>
<p class="calibre1">invokes an armchair, sprawls across it. “A network of point-to-point</p>
<p class="calibre1">wormholes linking routers, self-replicating communication hubs, in</p>
<p class="calibre1">orbit around most of the brown dwarfs of the galaxy. That’s what the</p>
<p class="calibre1">brochure said, right? That’s what we expected. Limited bandwidth, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">a lot of use to a mature superintelligence that has converted the free</p>
<p class="calibre1">mass of its birth solar system into computronium, but sufficient to</p>
<p class="calibre1">allow it to hold conversations with its neighbors. Conversations</p>
<p class="calibre1">carried out via a packet-switched network in real time, not limited by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the speed of light, but bound together by a common reference frame and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the latency between network hops.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s about the size of it,” she agrees from the carved-ruby throne</p>
<p class="calibre1">beside him. “Except there’s a trade delegation waiting for us. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">fact, they’re coming aboard already. And I don’t buy it - something</p>
<p class="calibre1">about the whole setup stinks.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre’s brow wrinkles. “You’re right, it doesn’t make sense,” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">says, finally. “Doesn’t make sense at all.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber nods. “I carry a ghost of Dad around. He’s really upset about</p>
<p class="calibre1">it.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen to your old man.” Pierre’s lips quirk humorlessly. “We were</p>
<p class="calibre1">going to jump through the looking glass, but it seems someone has</p>
<p class="calibre1">beaten us to the punch. Question is why?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t like it.” Amber reaches out sideways, and he catches her</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand. “And then there’s the lawsuit. We have to hold the trial sooner</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather than later.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He lets go of her fingers. “I’d really be much happier if you hadn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">named me as your champion.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hush.” The scenery changes; her throne is gone, and instead she’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">sitting on the arm of his chair, almost on top of him. “Listen. I had</p>
<p class="calibre1">a good reason.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Reason?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You have choice of weapons. In fact, you have the choice of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">field. This isn’t just ‘hit ‘em with a sword until they die’ time.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">She grins, impishly. “The whole point of a legal system that mandates</p>
<p class="calibre1">trial by combat for commercial lawsuits, as opposed to an adjudication</p>
<p class="calibre1">system, is to work out who’s a fitter servant of society and hence</p>
<p class="calibre1">deserving of preferential treatment. It’s crazy to apply the same</p>
<p class="calibre1">legal model to resolving corporate disputes that we use for arguments</p>
<p class="calibre1">among people, especially as most companies are now software</p>
<p class="calibre1">abstractions of business models; the interests of society are better</p>
<p class="calibre1">served by a system that encourages efficient trade activity than by</p>
<p class="calibre1">one that encourages litigation. It cuts down on corporate bullshit</p>
<p class="calibre1">while encouraging the toughest ones to survive, which is why I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">going to set up the trial as a contest to achieve maximum competitive</p>
<p class="calibre1">advantage in a xenocommerce scenario. Assuming they really are</p>
<p class="calibre1">traders, I figure we have more to trade with them than some damn</p>
<p class="calibre1">lawyer from the depths of earth’s light cone.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre blinks. “Um.” Blinks again. “I thought you wanted me to</p>
<p class="calibre1">sideload some kind of fencing kinematics program and skewer the guy?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Knowing how well I know you, why did you ever think that?” She slides</p>
<p class="calibre1">down the arm of his chair and lands on his lap. She twists round to</p>
<p class="calibre1">face him in point-blank close-up. “Shit, Pierre, I know you’re not</p>
<p class="calibre1">some kind of macho psychopath!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But your mother’s lawyers -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She shrugs dismissively. “They’re lawyers. Used to dealing with</p>
<p class="calibre1">precedents. Best way to fuck with their heads is to change the way the</p>
<p class="calibre1">universe works.” She leans against his chest. “You’ll make mincemeat</p>
<p class="calibre1">of them. Profit-to-earnings ratio through the roof, blood on the stock</p>
<p class="calibre1">exchange floor.” His hands meet around the small of her back. “My</p>

<p class="calibre1">The Tuileries are full of confused lobsters.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko has warped this virtual realm, implanting a symbolic gateway in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the carefully manicured gardens outside. The gateway is about two</p>
<p class="calibre1">meters in diameter, a verdigris-coated orouborous loop of bronze that</p>
<p class="calibre1">sits like an incongruous archway astride a gravel path in the grounds.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Giant black lobsters - each the size of a small pony - shuffle out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the loop’s baby blue buffer field, antennae twitching. They wouldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">be able to exist in the real world, but the physics model here has</p>
<p class="calibre1">been amended to permit them to breathe and move, by special</p>
<p class="calibre1">dispensation.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber sniffs derisively as she enters the great reception room of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sully wing. “Can’t trust that cat with anything,” she mutters.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was your idea, wasn’t it?” asks Su Ang, trying to duck past the</p>
<p class="calibre1">zombie ladies-in-waiting who carry Amber’s train. Soldiers line the</p>
<p class="calibre1">passage to either side, forming rows of steel to let the Queen pass</p>
<p class="calibre1">unhindered.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To let the cat have its way, yes,” Amber is annoyed. “But I didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">mean to let it wreck the continuity! I won’t have it!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I never saw the point of all this medievalism, before,” Ang observes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not as if you can avoid the singularity by hiding in the past.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre, following the Queen at a distance, shakes his head, knowing</p>
<p class="calibre1">better than to pick a fight with Amber over her idea of stage scenery.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It looks good,” Amber says tightly, standing before her throne and</p>
<p class="calibre1">waiting for the ladies-in-waiting to arrange themselves before her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She sits down carefully, her back straight as a ruler, voluminous</p>
<p class="calibre1">skirts belling up. Her dress is an intricate piece of sculpture that</p>
<p class="calibre1">uses the human body within as a support. “It impresses the yokels and</p>
<p class="calibre1">looks convincing on narrowcast media. It provides a prefabricated</p>
<p class="calibre1">sense of tradition. It hints at the political depths of fear and</p>
<p class="calibre1">loathing intrinsic to my court’s activities, and tells people not to</p>
<p class="calibre1">fuck with me. It reminds us where we’ve come from … and it doesn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">give away anything about where we’re going.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But that doesn’t make any difference to a bunch of alien lobsters,”</p>
<p class="calibre1">points out Su Ang. “They lack the reference points to understand it.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">She moves to stand behind the throne. Amber glances at Pierre, waves</p>
<p class="calibre1">him over.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre glances around, seeking real people, not the vacant eigenfaces</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the zombies that give this scenery added biological texture. There</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the red gown, isn’t that Donna the Journalist? And over there, too,</p>
<p class="calibre1">with shorter hair and wearing male drag; she gets everywhere. That’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">Boris, sitting behind the bishop.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You tell her,” Ang implores him.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t,” he admits. “We’re trying to establish communication, aren’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">we? But we don’t want to give too much away about what we are, how we</p>
<p class="calibre1">think. A historical distancing act will keep them from learning too</p>
<p class="calibre1">much about us: The phase-space of technological cultures that could</p>
<p class="calibre1">have descended from these roots is too wide to analyse easily. So</p>
<p class="calibre1">we’re leaving them with the lobster translators and not giving</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything away. Try to stay in character as a fifteenth-century duchess</p>
<p class="calibre1">from Alb� - it’s a matter of national security.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Humph.” Ang frowns as a flunky hustles forward to place a folding</p>
<p class="calibre1">chair behind her. She turns to face the expanse of red-and-gold carpet</p>
<p class="calibre1">that stretches to the doorway as trumpets blat and the doors swing</p>
<p class="calibre1">open to admit the deputation of lobsters.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lobsters are as large as wolves, black and spiny and ominous.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Their monochrome carapaces are at odds with the brightly colored garb</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the human crowd. Their antennae are large and sharp as swords. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">for all that, they advance hesitantly, eye turrets swiveling from side</p>
<p class="calibre1">to side as they take the scene in. Their tails drag ponderously on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">carpet, but they have no trouble standing.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first of the lobsters halts short of the throne and angles itself</p>
<p class="calibre1">to train an eye on Amber. “Am inconsistent,” it complains. “There is</p>
<p class="calibre1">no liquid hydrogen monoxide here, and you-species am misrepresented by</p>
<p class="calibre1">initial contact. Inconsistency, explain?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome to the human physical space-traveling interface unit Field</p>
<p class="calibre1">Circus,” Amber replies calmly. “I am pleased to see your translator is</p>
<p class="calibre1">working adequately. You are correct, there is no water here. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">lobsters don’t normally need it when they visit us. And we humans are</p>
<p class="calibre1">not water-dwellers. May I ask who you are when you’re not wearing</p>
<p class="calibre1">borrowed lobster bodies?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Confusion. The second lobster rears up and clatters its long, armored</p>
<p class="calibre1">antennae together. Soldiers to either side tighten their grips on</p>
<p class="calibre1">their spears, but it drops back down again soon enough.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We are the Wunch,” announces the first lobster, speaking clearly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is a body-compliant translation layer. Based on map received</p>
<p class="calibre1">from yourspace, units forty thousand trillion light-kilometers ago?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He means twenty years,” Pierre whispers on a private channel Amber</p>
<p class="calibre1">has multicast for the other real humans in the audience chamber</p>
<p class="calibre1">reality. “They’ve confused space and time for measurement purposes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Does this tell us something?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Relatively little,” comments someone else - Chandra? A round of</p>
<p class="calibre1">polite laughter greets the joke, and the tension in the room eases</p>
<p class="calibre1">slightly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We are the Wunch,” the lobster repeats. “We come to exchange</p>
<p class="calibre1">interest. What have you got that we want?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Faint frown lines appear on Amber’s forehead. Pierre can see her</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking very rapidly. “We consider it impolite to ask,” she says</p>
<p class="calibre1">quietly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clatter of claws on underlying stone floor. Chatter of clicking</p>
<p class="calibre1">mandibles. “You accept our translation?” asks the leader.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you referring to the transmission you sent us, uh, thirty</p>
<p class="calibre1">thousand trillion light-kilometers behind?” asks Amber.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lobster bobs up and down on its legs. “True. We send.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We cannot integrate that network,” Amber replies blandly, and Pierre</p>
<p class="calibre1">forces himself to keep a straight face. (Not that the lobsters can</p>
<p class="calibre1">read human body language yet, but they’ll undoubtedly be recording</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything that happens here for future analysis.) “They come from a</p>
<p class="calibre1">radically different species. Our goal in coming here is to connect our</p>
<p class="calibre1">species to the network. We wish to exchange advantageous information</p>
<p class="calibre1">with many other species.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Concern, alarm, agitation. “You cannot do that! You are not</p>
<p class="calibre1">untranslatable entity signifier.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber raises a hand. “You said untranslatable entity signifier. I did</p>
<p class="calibre1">not understand that. Can you paraphrase?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We, like you, are not untranslatable entity signifier. The network is</p>
<p class="calibre1">for untranslatable entity signifier. We are to the untranslatable</p>
<p class="calibre1">concept #1 as a single-celled organism is to ourselves. You and we</p>
<p class="calibre1">cannot untranslatable concept #2. To attempt trade with untranslatable</p>
<p class="calibre1">entity signifier is to invite death or transition to untranslatable</p>
<p class="calibre1">concept #1.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber snaps her fingers: time freezes. She glances round at Su Ang,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre, the other members of her primary team. “Opinions, anyone?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko, hitherto invisible, sits up on the carpet at the foot of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dais. “I’m not sure. The reason those macros are tagged is that</p>
<p class="calibre1">there’s something wrong with their semantics.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wrong with - how?” asks Su Ang.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat grins, cavernously, and begins to fade. “Wait!” snaps Amber.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko continues her fade, but leaves a shimmering presence behind:</p>
<p class="calibre1">not a grin, but a neural network weighting map, three-dimensional and</p>
<p class="calibre1">incomprehensibly complicated. “The untranslatable entity concept #1</p>
<p class="calibre1">when mapped onto the lobster’s grammar network has elements of ‘god’</p>
<p class="calibre1">overloaded with attributes of mysticism and zenlike</p>
<p class="calibre1">incomprehensibility. But I’m pretty sure that what it really means is</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘optimized conscious upload that runs much faster than realtime’. A</p>
<p class="calibre1">type-one weakly superhuman entity, like, um, the folks back home. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">implication is that this Wunch wants us to view them as gods.” The cat</p>
<p class="calibre1">fades back in. “Any takers?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Small-town hustlers,” mutters Amber. “Talking big - or using a dodgy</p>
<p class="calibre1">metagrammar that makes them sound bigger than they are - to bilk the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hayseeds new to the big city.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Most likely.” Aineko turns and begins to wash her flank.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are we going to do?” asks Su Ang.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do?” Amber raises a pencil-lined eyebrow, then flashes a grin that</p>
<p class="calibre1">chops a decade off her apparent age: “We’re going to mess with their</p>
<p class="calibre1">heads!” She snaps her fingers again and time unfreezes. There’s no</p>
<p class="calibre1">change in continuity except that Aineko is still present, at the foot</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the throne. The cat looks up and gives the queen a dirty look. “We</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand your concern,” Amber says smoothly, “but we have already</p>
<p class="calibre1">given you the physiology models and neural architecture of the bodies</p>
<p class="calibre1">that you are wearing. We want to communicate. Why won’t you show us</p>
<p class="calibre1">your real selves or your real language?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is trade language!” protests Lobster Number One. “Wunch am/are</p>

<p class="calibre1">front panel, but another instance turns round, crosses his arms, waits</p>
<p class="calibre1">for her to speak.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know you’re busy -” she begins, then stops. “Is it that important?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">she asks.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is.” Pierre blurs, resynchronizing his instances. “The router -</p>
<p class="calibre1">there are four wormholes leading off from it, did you know that? Each</p>
<p class="calibre1">of them is radiating at about 1011 Kelvins, and every wavelength is</p>
<p class="calibre1">carrying data connections, multiplexed, with a protocol stack that’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">at least eleven layers deep but maybe more - they show signs of</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-similarity in the framing headers. You know how much data that</p>
<p class="calibre1">is? It’s about 1012 times as much as our high-bandwidth uplink from</p>
<p class="calibre1">home. But compared to what’s on the other side of the ‘holes -” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">shakes his head.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s big?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s unimaginably big! These wormholes, they’re a low-bandwidth link</p>
<p class="calibre1">compared to the minds they’re hooking up to.” He blurs in front of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her, unable to stay still and unable to look away from the front</p>
<p class="calibre1">panel. Excitement or agitation? Su Ang can’t tell. With Pierre,</p>
<p class="calibre1">sometimes the two states are indistinguishable. He gets emotional</p>
<p class="calibre1">easily. “I think we have the outline of the answer to the Fermi</p>
<p class="calibre1">paradox. Transcendents don’t go traveling because they can’t get</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough bandwidth - trying to migrate through one of these wormholes</p>
<p class="calibre1">would be like trying to download your mind into a fruit fly, if they</p>
<p class="calibre1">are what I think they are - and the slower-than-light route is out,</p>
<p class="calibre1">too, because they couldn’t take enough computronium along. Unless -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s off again. But before he can blur out, Su Ang steps across and</p>
<p class="calibre1">lays hands on him. “Pierre. Calm down. Disengage. Empty yourself.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t!” He really is agitated, she sees. “I’ve got to figure out</p>
<p class="calibre1">the best trading strategy to get Amber off the hook with that lawsuit,</p>
<p class="calibre1">then tell her to get us out of here; being this close to the router is</p>
<p class="calibre1">seriously dangerous! The Wunch are the least of it.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He pauses his multiplicity of presences, converges on a single</p>
<p class="calibre1">identity focused on the here and now. “Yes?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s better.” She walks round him, slowly. “You’ve got to learn to</p>
<p class="calibre1">deal with stress more appropriately.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stress!” Pierre snorts. He shrugs, an impressive gesture with three</p>
<p class="calibre1">sets of shoulder blades. “That’s something I can turn off whenever I</p>
<p class="calibre1">need to. Side effect of this existence; we’re pigs in cyberspace,</p>
<p class="calibre1">wallowing in fleshy simulations, but unable to experience the new</p>
<p class="calibre1">environment in the raw. What did you want from me, Ang? Honestly? I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">a busy man, I’ve got a trading network to set up.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve got a problem with the Wunch right now, even if you think</p>
<p class="calibre1">something worse is out there,” Ang says patiently. “Boris thinks</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’re parasites, negative-sum gamers who stalk newbies like us.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Glashwiecz is apparently talking about cutting a deal with them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber’s suggestion is that you ignore them completely, cut them out,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and talk to anyone else who’ll listen.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyone else who’ll listen, right,” Pierre says heavily. “Any other</p>
<p class="calibre1">gems of wisdom to pass on from the throne?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ang takes a deep breath. He’s infuriating, she realizes. And worst of</p>
<p class="calibre1">all, he doesn’t realize. Infuriating but cute. “You’re setting up a</p>
<p class="calibre1">trading network, yes?” she asks.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. A standard network of independent companies, instantiated as</p>
<p class="calibre1">cellular automata within the Ring Imperium switched legal service</p>
<p class="calibre1">environment.” He relaxes slightly. “Each one has access to a</p>
<p class="calibre1">compartmentalized chunk of intellectual property and can call on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">corrected parser we got from that cat. They’re set up to communicate</p>
<p class="calibre1">with a blackboard system - a souk - and I’m bringing up a link to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">router, a multicast link that’ll broadcast the souk’s existence to</p>
<p class="calibre1">anyone who’s listening. Trade …” his eyebrows furrow. “There are at</p>
<p class="calibre1">least two different currency standards in this network, used to buy</p>
<p class="calibre1">quality-of-service precedence and bandwidth. They depreciate with</p>
<p class="calibre1">distance, as if the whole concept of money was invented to promote the</p>
<p class="calibre1">development of long-range network links. If I can get in first, when</p>
<p class="calibre1">Glashwiecz tries to cut in on the dealing by offering IP at discounted</p>
<p class="calibre1">rates -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s not going to, Pierre,” she says as gently as possible. “Listen</p>
<p class="calibre1">to what I said: Glashwiecz is going to focus on the Wunch. He’s going</p>
<p class="calibre1">to offer them a deal. Amber wants you to ignore them. Got that?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got it.” There’s a hollow bong! from one of the communication bells.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey, that’s interesting.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is?” She stretches, neck extending snakelike so that she can see</p>
<p class="calibre1">the window on underlying reality that’s flickered into existence in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the air before him.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An ack from …” he pauses, then plucks a neatly reified concept from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the screen in front of him and presents it to her in a silvery caul of</p>
<p class="calibre1">light. “… about two hundred light-years away! Someone wants to</p>
<p class="calibre1">talk.” He smiles. Then the front panel workstation bong’s again. “Hey</p>
<p class="calibre1">again. I wonder what that says.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s the work of a moment to pipe the second message through the</p>
<p class="calibre1">translator. Oddly, it doesn’t translate at first. Pierre has to</p>
<p class="calibre1">correct for some weird destructive interference in the fake lobster</p>
<p class="calibre1">network before it’ll spill its guts. “That’s interesting,” he says.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll say.” Ang lets her neck collapse back to normal. “I’d better go</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell Amber.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You do that,” Pierre says worriedly. He makes eye contact with her,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but what she’s hoping to see in his face just isn’t there. He’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">wearing his emotions entirely on the surface. “I’m not surprised their</p>
<p class="calibre1">translator didn’t want to pass that message along.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s a deliberately corrupted grammar,” Ang murmurs, and bangs out in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the direction of Amber’s audience chamber; “and they’re actually</p>
<p class="calibre1">making threats.” The Wunch, it seems, have acquired a very bad</p>
<p class="calibre1">reputation somewhere along the line - and Amber needs to know.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Glashwiecz leans toward Lobster Number One, stomach churning. It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">only a realtime kilosecond since his bar-room interview, but in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">intervening subjective time, he’s abolished a hangover, honed his</p>
<p class="calibre1">brief, and decided to act. In the Tuileries. “You’ve been lied to,” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">confides quietly, trusting the privacy ackles that he browbeat Amber’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother into giving him - access lists that give him a degree of</p>
<p class="calibre1">control over the regime within this virtual universe that the cat</p>
<p class="calibre1">dragged in.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lied? Context rendered horizontal in past, or subjected to</p>
<p class="calibre1">grammatical corruption? Linguistic evil?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The latter.” Glashwiecz enjoys this, even though it forces him to get</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather closer to the two-meter-long virtual crustacean than he’d like.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Showing a mark how they’ve been scammed is always good, especially</p>
<p class="calibre1">when you hold the keys to the door of the cage they’re locked inside.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“They are not telling you the truth about this system.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We received assurances,” Lobster Number One says clearly. Its</p>
<p class="calibre1">mouthparts move ceaselessly - the noise comes from somewhere inside</p>
<p class="calibre1">its head. “You do not share this phenotype. Why?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That information will cost you,” says Glashwiecz. “I am willing to</p>
<p class="calibre1">provide it on credit.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">They haggle briefly. An exchange rate in questions is agreed, as is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">trust metric to grade the answers by. “Disclose all,” insists the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wunch negotiator.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There are multiple sentient species on the world we come from,” says</p>
<p class="calibre1">the lawyer. “The form you wear belongs to only one - one that wanted</p>
<p class="calibre1">to get away from the form I wear, the original conscious tool-creating</p>
<p class="calibre1">species. Some of the species today are artificial, but all of us trade</p>
<p class="calibre1">information for self-advantage.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is good to know,” the lobster assures him. “We like to buy</p>
<p class="calibre1">species.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You buy species?” Glashwiecz cocks his head.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We have the unbearable yearning to be not-what-we-are,” says the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lobster. “Novelty, surprise! Flesh rots and wood decays. We seek the</p>
<p class="calibre1">new being-ness of aliens. Give us your somatotype, give us all your</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughts, and we will dream you over.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think something might be arranged,” Glashwiecz concedes. “So you</p>
<p class="calibre1">want to be - no, to lease the rights to temporarily be human? Why is</p>
<p class="calibre1">that?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Untranslatable concept #3 means untranslatable concept #4. God told</p>
<p class="calibre1">us to.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay, I think I’ll just have to take that on trust for now. What is</p>
<p class="calibre1">your true form?” he asks.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait and I show you,” says the lobster. It begins to shudder.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you doing -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait.” The lobster twitches, writhing slightly, like a portly</p>
<p class="calibre1">businessman adjusting his underwear after a heavy business lunch.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Disturbing shapes move, barely visible through the thick chitinous</p>
<p class="calibre1">armor. “We want your help,” the lobster explains, voice curiously</p>
<p class="calibre1">muffled. “Want to establish direct trade links. Physical emissaries,</p>
<p class="calibre1">yes?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, that’s very good,” Glashwiecz agrees excitedly: It’s exactly</p>
<p class="calibre1">what he’s hoped for, the sought-after competitive advantage that will</p>
<p class="calibre1">prove his fitness in Amber’s designated trial by corporate combat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re going to deal with us directly without using that shell</p>
<p class="calibre1">interface?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Agreed.” The lobster trails off into muffled silence; little</p>
<p class="calibre1">crunching noises trickle out of its carapace. Then Glashwiecz hears</p>
<p class="calibre1">footsteps behind him on the gravel path.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you doing here?” he demands, looking round. It’s Pierre,</p>
<p class="calibre1">back in standard human form - a sword hangs from his belt, and there’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">a big wheel-lock pistol in his hands. “Hey!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Step away from the alien, lawyer,” Pierre warns, raising the gun.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Glashwiecz glances back at Lobster Number One. It’s pulled its front</p>
<p class="calibre1">inside the protective shell, and it’s writhing now, rocking from side</p>
<p class="calibre1">to side alarmingly. Something inside the shell is turning black,</p>
<p class="calibre1">acquiring depth and texture. “I stand on counsel’s privilege,”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Glashwiecz insists. “Speaking as this alien’s attorney, I must protest</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the strongest terms -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without warning, the lobster lurches forward and rises up on its rear</p>
<p class="calibre1">legs. It reaches out with huge claws, chellipeds coated with spiny</p>
<p class="calibre1">hairs, and grabs Glashwiecz by his arms. “Hey!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Glashwiecz tries to turn away, but the lobster is already looming over</p>
<p class="calibre1">him, maxillipeds and maxillae reaching out from its head. There’s a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sickening crunch as one of his elbow joints crumbles, humerus</p>
<p class="calibre1">shattered by the closing jaws of a chelliped. He draws breath to</p>
<p class="calibre1">scream, then the four small maxillae grip his head and draw it down</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward the churning mandibles.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre scurries sideways, trying to find a line of fire on the lobster</p>
<p class="calibre1">that doesn’t pass through the lawyer’s body. The lobster isn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">cooperating. It turns on the spot, clutching Glashwiecz’s convulsing</p>
<p class="calibre1">body to itself. There’s a stench of shit, and blood is squirting from</p>
<p class="calibre1">its mouthparts. Something is very wrong with the biophysics model</p>
<p class="calibre1">here, the realism turned up way higher than normal.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Merde,” whispers Pierre. He fumbles with the bulky trigger, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">there’s a faint whirring sound but no explosion.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">More wet crunching sounds follow as the lobster demolishes the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lawyer’s face and swallows convulsively, sucking his head and</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulders all the way into its gastric mill.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre glances at the heavy handgun. “Shit!” he screams. He glances</p>
<p class="calibre1">back at the lobster, then turns and runs for the nearest wall. There</p>
<p class="calibre1">are other lobsters loose in the formal garden. “Amber, emergency!” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">sends over their private channel. “Hostiles in the Louvre!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lobster that’s taken Glashwiecz hunkers down over the body and</p>
<p class="calibre1">quivers. Pierre desperately winds the spring on his gun, too rattled</p>
<p class="calibre1">to check that it’s loaded. He glances back at the alien intruder.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They’ve sprung the biophysics model, he sends. I could die in here, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">realizes, momentarily shocked. This instance of me could die forever.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lobster shell sitting in the pool of blood and human wreckage</p>
<p class="calibre1">splits in two. A humanoid form begins to uncurl from within it,</p>
<p class="calibre1">pale-skinned and glistening wet: vacant blue eyes flicker from side to</p>
<p class="calibre1">side as it stretches and stands upright, wobbling uncertainty on its</p>
<p class="calibre1">two unstable legs. Its mouth opens and a strange gobbling hiss comes</p>
<p class="calibre1">forth.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre recognizes her. “What are you doing here?” he yells.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The nude woman turns toward him. She’s the spitting image of Amber’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother, except for the chellipeds she has in place of hands. She</p>
<p class="calibre1">hisses “Equity!” and takes a wobbly step toward him, pincers clacking.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre winds the firing handle again. There’s a crash of gunpowder and</p>
<p class="calibre1">smoke, a blow that nearly sprains his elbow, and the nude woman’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">chest erupts in a spray of blood. She snarls at him wordlessly and</p>
<p class="calibre1">staggers - then ragged flaps of bloody meat close together, knitting</p>
<p class="calibre1">shut with improbable speed. She resumes her advance.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I told Amber the Matrix would be more defensible,” Pierre snarls,</p>
<p class="calibre1">dropping the firearm and drawing his sword as the alien turns in his</p>
<p class="calibre1">direction and raises arms that end in pincers. “We need guns, damit!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Lots of guns!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Waaant equity,” hisses the alien intruder.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can’t be Pamela Macx,” says Pierre, his back to the wall, keeping</p>
<p class="calibre1">the sword point before the lobster-woman-thing. “She’s in a nunnery in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Armenia or something. You pulled that out of Glashwiecz’s memories -</p>
<p class="calibre1">he worked for her, didn’t he?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Claws go snicker-snack before his face. “Investment partnership!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">screeches the harridan. “Seat on the board! Eat brains for breakfast!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">It lurches sideways, trying to get past his guard.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t fucking believe this,” Pierre snarls. The Wunch-creature</p>
<p class="calibre1">jumps at just the wrong moment and slides onto the point of his blade,</p>
<p class="calibre1">claws clacking hungrily. Pierre slides away, nearly leaving his skin</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the rough bricks of the wall - and what’s good for one is good for</p>
<p class="calibre1">all, as the hacked model in force in this reality compels the attacker</p>
<p class="calibre1">to groan and collapse.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre pulls the sword out then, nervously glancing over his shoulder,</p>
<p class="calibre1">whacks at her neck. The impact jars his arm, but he keeps hacking</p>
<p class="calibre1">until there’s blood spraying everywhere, blood on his shirt, blood on</p>
<p class="calibre1">his sword, and a round thing sitting on a stump of savaged neck</p>
<p class="calibre1">nearby, jaw working soundlessly in undeath.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looks at it for a moment, then his stomach rebels and tries to</p>
<p class="calibre1">empty itself into the mess. “Where the hell is everybody?” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">broadcasts on the private channel. “Hostiles in the Louvre!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He straightens up, gasping for breath. He feels alive, frightened and</p>
<p class="calibre1">appalled and exhilarated simultaneously. The crackle of bursting</p>
<p class="calibre1">shells on all sides drowns out the birdsong as the Wunch’s emissaries</p>
<p class="calibre1">adopt a variety of new and supposedly more lethal forms. “They don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">seem to be very clear on how to take over a simulation space,” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">adds. “Maybe we already are untranslatable concept number #1 as far as</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’re concerned.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t worry, I’ve cut off the incoming connection,” sends Su Ang.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is just a bridgehead force; the invasion packets are being</p>
<p class="calibre1">filtered out.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blank-eyed men and women in dusty black uniforms are hatching from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lobster shells, stumbling and running around the grounds of the royal</p>
<p class="calibre1">palace like confused Huguenot invaders.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boris winks into reality behind Pierre. “Which way?” he demands,</p>
<p class="calibre1">pulling out an anachronistic but lethal katana.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Over here. Let’s work this together.” Pierre jacks his emotional</p>
<p class="calibre1">damper up to a dangerously high setting, suppressing natural aversion</p>
<p class="calibre1">reflexes and temporarily turning himself into a sociopathic killer. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">stalks toward an infant lobster-thing with big black eyes and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">covering of white hair that mewls at him from a rose bed, and Boris</p>
<p class="calibre1">looks away while he kills it. Then one of the larger ones makes the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mistake of lunging at Boris, and he chops at it reflexively.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of the Wunch try to fight back when Pierre and Boris try to kill</p>
<p class="calibre1">them, but they’re handicapped by their anatomy, a curious mixture of</p>
<p class="calibre1">crustacean and human, claw and mandible against sword and dagger. When</p>
<p class="calibre1">they bleed the ground soaks with the cuprous hue of lobster juice.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s fork,” suggests Boris. “Get this over with.” Pierre nods, dully</p>
<p class="calibre1">- everything around him is wrapped in a layer of don’t-care, except</p>
<p class="calibre1">for a glowing dot of artificial hatred - and they fork, multiplying</p>
<p class="calibre1">their state vectors to take full advantage of the virtualization</p>
<p class="calibre1">facilities of this universe. There’s no need for reinforcements; the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wunch focused on attacking the biophysics model of the universe,</p>
<p class="calibre1">making it mimic a physical reality as closely as possible, and paid no</p>
<p class="calibre1">attention to learning the more intricate tactics that war in a virtual</p>
<p class="calibre1">space permits.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Presently Pierre finds himself in the audience chamber, face and hands</p>
<p class="calibre1">and clothing caked in hideous gore, leaning on the back of Amber’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">throne. There’s only one of him now. One of Boris - the only one? - is</p>
<p class="calibre1">standing near the doorway. He can barely remember what has happened,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the horrors of parallel instances of mass murder blocked from his</p>
<p class="calibre1">long-term memory by a high-pass trauma filter. “It looks clear,” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">calls aloud. “What shall we do now?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait for Catherine de M�dicis to show up,” says the cat, its grin</p>
<p class="calibre1">materializing before him like a numinous threat. “Amber always finds a</p>
<p class="calibre1">way to blame her mother. Or didn’t you already know that?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre glances at the bloody mess on the footpath outside where the</p>
<p class="calibre1">first lobster-woman attacked Glashwiecz. “I already did for her, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">think.” He remembers the action in the third person, all subjectivity</p>
<p class="calibre1">edited out. “The family resemblance was striking,” the thread that</p>
<p class="calibre1">still remembers her in working memory murmurs: “I just hope it’s only</p>
<p class="calibre1">skin-deep.” Then he forgets the act of apparent murder forever. “Tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Queen I’m ready to talk.”</p>

<p class="calibre1">Welcome to the downslope on the far side of the curve of</p>
<p class="calibre1">accelerating progress.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back in the solar system, Earth orbits through a dusty tunnel in</p>
<p class="calibre1">space. Sunlight still reaches the birth world, but much of the rest</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the star’s output has been trapped by the growing concentric</p>
<p class="calibre1">shells of computronium built from the wreckage of the innermost</p>
<p class="calibre1">planets.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two billion or so mostly unmodified humans scramble in the wreckage</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the phase transition, not understanding why the vasty</p>
<p class="calibre1">superculture they so resented has fallen quiet. Little information</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaks through their fundamentalist firewalls, but what there is</p>
<p class="calibre1">shows a disquieting picture of a society where there are no bodies</p>
<p class="calibre1">anymore. Utility foglets blown on the wind form aerogel towers</p>
<p class="calibre1">larger than cyclones, removing the last traces of physical human</p>
<p class="calibre1">civilization from most of Europe and the North American coastlines.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Enclaves huddle behind their walls and wonder at the monsters and</p>
<p class="calibre1">portents roaming the desert of postindustrial civilization,</p>
<p class="calibre1">mistaking acceleration for collapse.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The hazy shells of computronium that ring the sun - concentric</p>
<p class="calibre1">clouds of nanocomputers the size of rice grains, powered by</p>
<p class="calibre1">sunlight, orbiting in shells like the packed layers of a Matrioshka</p>
<p class="calibre1">doll - are still immature, holding barely a thousandth of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">physical planetary mass of the system, but they already support a</p>
<p class="calibre1">classical computational density of 10^42 MIPS; enough to support a</p>
<p class="calibre1">billion civilizations as complex as the one that existed</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediately before the great disassembly. The conversion hasn’t yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">reached the gas giants, and some scant outer-system enclaves remain</p>
<p class="calibre1">independent - Amber’s Ring Imperium still exists as a separate</p>
<p class="calibre1">entity, and will do so for some years to come - but the inner solar</p>
<p class="calibre1">system planets, with the exception of Earth, have been colonized</p>
<p class="calibre1">more thoroughly than any dusty NASA proposal from the dawn of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">space age could have envisaged.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">From outside the Accelerated civilization, it isn’t really possible</p>
<p class="calibre1">to know what’s going on inside. The problem is bandwidth: While</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s possible to send data in and get data out, the sheer amount of</p>
<p class="calibre1">computation going on in the virtual spaces of the Acceleration</p>
<p class="calibre1">dwarfs any external observer. Inside that swarm, minds a trillion</p>
<p class="calibre1">or more times as complex as humanity think thoughts as far beyond</p>
<p class="calibre1">human imagination as a microprocessor is beyond a nematode worm. A</p>
<p class="calibre1">million random human civilizations flourish in worldscapes tucked</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the corner of this world-mind. Death is abolished, life is</p>
<p class="calibre1">triumphant. A thousand ideologies flower, human nature adapted</p>
<p class="calibre1">where necessary to make this possible. Ecologies of thought are</p>
<p class="calibre1">forming in a Cambrian explosion of ideas: For the solar system is</p>
<p class="calibre1">finally rising to consciousness, and mind is no longer restricted</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the mere kilotons of gray fatty meat harbored in fragile human</p>
<p class="calibre1">skulls.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somewhere in the Acceleration, colorless green ideas adrift in</p>
<p class="calibre1">furious sleep remember a tiny starship launched years ago, and pay</p>
<p class="calibre1">attention. Soon, they realize, the starship will be in position to</p>
<p class="calibre1">act as their proxy in an ages-long conversation. Negotiations for</p>
<p class="calibre1">access to Amber’s extrasolar asset commence; the Ring Imperium</p>
<p class="calibre1">prospers, at least for a while.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But first, the operating software on the human side of the network</p>
<p class="calibre1">link will require an upgrade.</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The audience chamber in the Field Circus is crammed. Everybody aboard</p>
<p class="calibre1">the ship - except the still-frozen lawyer and the alien barbarian</p>
<p class="calibre1">intruders - is present. They’ve just finished reviewing the recordings</p>
<p class="calibre1">of what happened in the Tuileries, of Glashwiecz’s fatal last</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversation with the Wunch, the resulting fight for survival. And now</p>
<p class="calibre1">the time has come for decisions.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not saying you have to follow me,” says Amber, addressing her</p>
<p class="calibre1">court; “just, it’s what we came here for. We’ve established that</p>
<p class="calibre1">there’s enough bandwidth to transmit people and their necessary</p>
<p class="calibre1">support VMs; we’ve got some basic expectancy of goodwill at the other</p>
<p class="calibre1">end, or at least an agalmic willingness to gift us with advice about</p>
<p class="calibre1">the untrustworthiness of the Wunch. I propose to copy myself through</p>
<p class="calibre1">and see what’s at the other side of the wormhole. What’s more, I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">going to suspend myself on this side and hand over to whichever</p>
<p class="calibre1">instance of me comes back, unless there’s a long hiatus. How long, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">haven’t decided yet. Are you guys happy to join me?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre stands behind her throne, hands on the back. Looking down over</p>
<p class="calibre1">her head, at the cat in her lap, he’s sure he sees it narrow its eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">at him. Funny, he thinks, we’re talking about jumping down a rabbit</p>
<p class="calibre1">hole and trusting whoever lives at the other end with our</p>
<p class="calibre1">personalities. After seeing the Wunch. Does this make sense?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Forgive, please, but am not stupid,” says Boris. “This is Fermi</p>
<p class="calibre1">paradox territory, no? Instantaneous network exists, is traversable,</p>
<p class="calibre1">with bandwidth adequate for human-equivalent minds. Where are alien</p>
<p class="calibre1">visitors, in history? Must be overriding reason for absence. Think</p>
<p class="calibre1">will wait here and see what comes back. Then make up mind to drink the</p>
<p class="calibre1">poison kool-aid.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve got half a mind to transmit myself through without a back-up,”</p>
<p class="calibre1">says someone else - “but that’s okay; half a mind is all we’ve got the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bandwidth for.” Halfhearted laughter shores up his wisecrack, supports</p>
<p class="calibre1">a flagging determination to press through.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m with Boris,” says Su Ang. She glances at Pierre, catches his eye:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly a number of things become clear to him. He shakes his head</p>
<p class="calibre1">minutely. You never had a chance - I belong to Amber, he thinks, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">deletes the thought before he can send it to her. Maybe in another</p>
<p class="calibre1">instantiation his issues with the Queen’s droit de seigneur would have</p>
<p class="calibre1">bulked up larger, splintered his determination; maybe in another world</p>
<p class="calibre1">it has already happened? “I think this is very rash,” she says in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">hurry. “We don’t know enough about postsingularity civilizations.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not a singularity,” Amber says waspishly. “It’s just a brief</p>
<p class="calibre1">burst of acceleration. Like cosmological inflation.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Smooths out inhomogeneities in the initial structure of</p>
<p class="calibre1">consciousness,” purrs the cat. “Don’t I get a vote?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You do.” Amber sighs. She glances round. “Pierre?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heart in his mouth: “I’m with you.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She smiles, brilliantly. “Well then. Will the nay sayers please leave</p>
<p class="calibre1">the universe?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly, the audience chamber is half-empty.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m setting a watchdog timer for a billion seconds into the future,</p>
<p class="calibre1">to restart us from this point if the router doesn’t send anyone back</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the intervening time,” she announces gravely, taking in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">serious-faced avatars of those who remain. Surprised: “Sadeq! I didn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">think this was your type of -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He doesn’t smile: “Would I be true to my faith if I wasn’t prepared to</p>
<p class="calibre1">bring the words of Mohammed, peace be unto him, to those who may never</p>
<p class="calibre1">have heard his name?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber nods. “I guess.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do it,” Pierre says urgently. “You can’t keep putting it off</p>
<p class="calibre1">forever.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko raises her head: “Spoilsport!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.” Amber nods. “Let’s do -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She punches an imaginary switch, and time stops.</p>

<p class="calibre1">At the far end of a wormhole, two hundred light-years distant in real</p>
