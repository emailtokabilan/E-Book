<h2 id="calibre_toc_10" class="calibre3">Chapter 4: Halo</h2><p class="calibre1">The asteroid is running Barney: it sings of love on the high frontier,</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the passion of matter for replicators, and its friendship for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">needy billions of the Pacific Rim. “I love you,” it croons in Amber’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">ears as she seeks a precise fix on it: “Let me give you a big hug …”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">A fraction of a light-second away, Amber locks a cluster of cursors</p>
<p class="calibre1">together on the signal, trains them to track its Doppler shift, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">reads off the orbital elements. “Locked and loaded,” she mutters. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">animated purple dinosaur pirouettes and prances in the middle of her</p>
<p class="calibre1">viewport, throwing a diamond-tipped swizzle stick overhead.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sarcastically: “Big hug time! I got asteroid!” Cold gas thrusters bang</p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhere behind her in the interstage docking ring, prodding the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cumbersome farm ship round to orient on the Barney rock. She damps her</p>
<p class="calibre1">enthusiasm self-consciously, her implants hungrily sequestrating</p>
<p class="calibre1">surplus neurotransmitter molecules floating around her synapses before</p>
<p class="calibre1">reuptake sets in. It doesn’t do to get too excited in free flight. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">the impulse to spin handstands, jump and sing is still there: It’s her</p>
<p class="calibre1">rock, and it loves her, and she’s going to bring it to life.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The workspace of Amber’s room is a mass of stuff that probably doesn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">belong on a spaceship. Posters of the latest Lebanese boy band bump</p>
<p class="calibre1">and grind through their glam routines: Tentacular restraining straps</p>
<p class="calibre1">wave from the corners of her sleeping bag, somehow accumulating a</p>
<p class="calibre1">crust of dirty clothing from the air like a giant inanimate hydra.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(Cleaning robots seldom dare to venture inside the teenager’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">bedroom.) One wall is repeatedly cycling through a simulation of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">projected construction cycle of Habitat One, a big fuzzy sphere with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">glowing core (that Amber is doing her bit to help create). Three or</p>
<p class="calibre1">four small pastel-colored plastic kawaii dolls stalk each other across</p>
<p class="calibre1">its circumference with million-kilometer strides. And her father’s cat</p>
<p class="calibre1">is curled up between the aircon duct and her costume locker, snoring</p>
<p class="calibre1">in a high-pitched tone.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber yanks open the faded velour curtain that shuts her room off from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the rest of the hive: “I’ve got it!” she shouts. “It’s all mine! I</p>
<p class="calibre1">rule!” It’s the sixteenth rock tagged by the orphanage so far, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s the first that she’s tagged by herself, and that makes it</p>
<p class="calibre1">special. She bounces off the other side of the commons, surprising one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Oscar’s cane toads - which should be locked down in the farm, it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">not clear how it got here - and the audio repeaters copy the incoming</p>
<p class="calibre1">signal, noise-fuzzed echoes of a thousand fossilized infants’ video</p>

<p class="calibre1">“You’re so prompt, Amber,” Pierre whines when she corners him in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">canteen.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, yeah!” She tosses her head, barely concealing a smirk of</p>
<p class="calibre1">delight at her own brilliance. She knows it isn’t nice, but Mom is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">long way away, and Dad and Stepmom don’t care about that kind of</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing. “I’m brilliant, me,” she announces. “Now what about our bet?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aww.” Pierre thrusts his hands deep into his pockets. “But I don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">have two million on me in change right now. Next cycle?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh?” She’s outraged. “But we had a bet!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh, Dr. Bayes said you weren’t going to make it this time, either, so</p>
<p class="calibre1">I stuck my smart money in an options trade. If I take it out now, I’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">take a big hit. Can you give me until cycle’s end?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You should know better than to trust a sim, Pee.” Her avatar blazes</p>
<p class="calibre1">at him with early-teen contempt: Pierre hunches his shoulders under</p>
<p class="calibre1">her gaze. He’s only twelve, freckled, hasn’t yet learned that you</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t welsh on a deal. “I’ll let you do it this time,” she announces,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“but you’ll have to pay for it. I want interest.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He sighs. “What base rate are you -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, your interest! Slave for a cycle!” She grins malevolently.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And his face shifts abruptly into apprehension: “As long as you don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">make me clean the litter tray again. You aren’t planning on doing</p>

<p class="calibre1">Welcome to the fourth decade. The thinking mass of the solar system</p>
<p class="calibre1">now exceeds one MIPS per gram; it’s still pretty dumb, but it’s not</p>
<p class="calibre1">dumb all over. The human population is near maximum overshoot,</p>
<p class="calibre1">pushing nine billion, but its growth rate is tipping toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">negative numbers, and bits of what used to be the first world are</p>
<p class="calibre1">now facing a middle-aged average. Human cogitation provides about</p>
<p class="calibre1">10^28 MIPS of the solar system’s brainpower. The real thinking is</p>
<p class="calibre1">mostly done by the halo of a thousand trillion processors that</p>
<p class="calibre1">surround the meat machines with a haze of computation -</p>
<p class="calibre1">individually a tenth as powerful as a human brain, collectively</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’re ten thousand times more powerful, and their numbers are</p>
<p class="calibre1">doubling every twenty million seconds. They’re up to 10^33 MIPS and</p>
<p class="calibre1">rising, although there’s a long way to go before the solar system</p>
<p class="calibre1">is fully awake.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Technologies come, technologies go, but nobody even five years ago</p>
<p class="calibre1">predicted that there’d be tinned primates in orbit around Jupiter</p>
<p class="calibre1">by now: A synergy of emergent industries and strange business</p>
<p class="calibre1">models have kick-started the space age again, aided and abetted by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the discovery of (so far undecrypted) signals from ETs. Unexpected</p>
<p class="calibre1">fringe riders are developing new ecological niches on the edge of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the human information space, light-minutes and light-hours from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">core, as an expansion that has hung fire since the 1970s gets under</p>
<p class="calibre1">way.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber, like most of the postindustrialists aboard the orphanage</p>
<p class="calibre1">ship Ernst Sanger, is in her early teens: While their natural</p>
<p class="calibre1">abilities are in many cases enhanced by germ-line genetic</p>
<p class="calibre1">recombination, thanks to her mother’s early ideals she has to rely</p>
<p class="calibre1">on brute computational enhancements. She doesn’t have a posterior</p>
<p class="calibre1">parietal cortex hacked for extra short-term memory, or an anterior</p>
<p class="calibre1">superior temporal gyrus tweaked for superior verbal insight, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">she’s grown up with neural implants that feel as natural to her as</p>
<p class="calibre1">lungs or fingers. Half her wetware is running outside her skull on</p>
<p class="calibre1">an array of processor nodes hooked into her brain by</p>
<p class="calibre1">quantum-entangled communication channels - her own personal</p>
<p class="calibre1">metacortex. These kids are mutant youth, burning bright: Not quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">incomprehensible to their parents, but profoundly alien - the</p>
<p class="calibre1">generation gap is as wide as the 1960s and as deep as the solar</p>
<p class="calibre1">system. Their parents, born in the gutter years of the twenty-first</p>
<p class="calibre1">century, grew up with white elephant shuttles and a space station</p>
<p class="calibre1">that just went round and round, and computers that went beep when</p>
<p class="calibre1">you pushed their buttons. The idea that Jupiter orbit was somewhere</p>
<p class="calibre1">you could go was as profoundly counterintuitive as the Internet to</p>
<p class="calibre1">a baby boomer.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of the passengers on the can have run away from parents who</p>
<p class="calibre1">think that teenagers belong in school, unable to come to terms with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a generation so heavily augmented that they are fundamentally</p>
<p class="calibre1">brighter than the adults around them. Amber was fluent in nine</p>
<p class="calibre1">languages by the age of six, only two of them human and six of them</p>
<p class="calibre1">serializable; when she was seven, her mother took her to the school</p>
<p class="calibre1">psychiatrist for speaking in synthetic tongues. That was the final</p>
<p class="calibre1">straw for Amber: using an illicit anonymous phone, she called her</p>
<p class="calibre1">father. Her mother had him under a restraining order, but it hadn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">occurred to her to apply for an order against his partner …</p>

<p class="calibre1">Vast whorls of cloud ripple beneath the ship’s drive stinger: Orange</p>
<p class="calibre1">and brown and muddy gray streaks slowly crawl across the bloated</p>
<p class="calibre1">horizon of Jupiter. Sanger is nearing perijove, deep within the gas</p>
<p class="calibre1">giant’s lethal magnetic field; static discharges flicker along the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tube, arcing over near the deep violet exhaust cloud emerging from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">magnetic mirrors of the ship’s VASIMR motor. The plasma rocket is</p>
<p class="calibre1">cranked up to high mass flow, its specific impulse almost as low as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fission rocket but producing maximum thrust as the assembly creaks and</p>
<p class="calibre1">groans through the gravitational assist maneuver. In another hour, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">drive will flicker off, and the orphanage will fall up and out toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ganymede, before dropping back in toward orbit around Amalthea,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jupiter’s fourth moon (and source of much of the material in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gossamer ring). They’re not the first canned primates to make it to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jupiter subsystem, but they’re one of the first wholly private</p>
<p class="calibre1">ventures. The bandwidth out here sucks dead slugs through a straw,</p>
<p class="calibre1">with millions of kilometers of vacuum separating them from scant</p>
<p class="calibre1">hundreds of mouse-brained microprobes and a few dinosaurs left behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">by NASA or ESA. They’re so far from the inner system that a good chunk</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the ship’s communications array is given over to caching: The news</p>
<p class="calibre1">is whole kiloseconds old by the time it gets out here.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber, along with about half the waking passengers, watches in</p>
<p class="calibre1">fascination from the common room. The commons are a long axial</p>
<p class="calibre1">cylinder, a double-hulled inflatable at the center of the ship with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">large part of their liquid water supply stored in its wall tubes. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">far end is video-enabled, showing them a realtime 3D view of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">planet as it rolls beneath them: in reality, there’s as much mass as</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible between them and the trapped particles in the Jovian magnetic</p>
<p class="calibre1">envelope. “I could go swimming in that,” sighs Lilly. “Just imagine,</p>
<p class="calibre1">diving into that sea …” Her avatar appears in the window, riding a</p>
<p class="calibre1">silver surfboard down the kilometers of vacuum.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nice case of wind-burn you’ve got there,” someone jeers - Kas.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly Lilly’s avatar, hitherto clad in a shimmering metallic</p>
<p class="calibre1">swimsuit, turns to the texture of baked meat and waggles sausage</p>
<p class="calibre1">fingers up at them in warning.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Same to you and the window you climbed in through!” Abruptly the</p>
<p class="calibre1">virtual vacuum outside the window is full of bodies, most of them</p>
<p class="calibre1">human, contorting and writhing and morphing in mock-combat as half the</p>
<p class="calibre1">kids pitch into the virtual death match. It’s a gesture in the face of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the sharp fear that outside the thin walls of the orphanage lies an</p>
<p class="calibre1">environment that really is as hostile as Lilly’s toasted avatar would</p>
<p class="calibre1">indicate.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber turns back to her slate: She’s working through a complex mess of</p>
<p class="calibre1">forms, necessary before the expedition can start work. Facts and</p>
<p class="calibre1">figures that are never far away crowd around her, intimidating.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jupiter weighs 1.9 x 1027 kilograms. There are twenty-nine Jovian</p>
<p class="calibre1">moons and an estimated two hundred thousand minor bodies, lumps of</p>
<p class="calibre1">rock, and bits of debris crowded around them - debris above the size</p>
<p class="calibre1">of ring fragments, for Jupiter (like Saturn) has rings, albeit not as</p>
<p class="calibre1">prominent. A total of six major national orbiter platforms have made</p>
<p class="calibre1">it out here - and another two hundred and seventeen microprobes, all</p>
<p class="calibre1">but six of them private entertainment platforms. The first human</p>
<p class="calibre1">expedition was put together by ESA Studios six years ago, followed by</p>
<p class="calibre1">a couple of wildcat mining prospectors and a M-commerce bus that</p>
<p class="calibre1">scattered half a million picoprobes throughout Jupiter subsystem. Now</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Sanger has arrived, along with another three monkey cans (one from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars, two more from LEO) and it looks as if colonization is about to</p>
<p class="calibre1">explode, except that there are at least four mutually exclusive Grand</p>
<p class="calibre1">Plans for what to do with old Jove’s mass.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone prods her. “Hey, Amber, what are you up to?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She opens her eyes. “Doing my homework.” It’s Su Ang. “Look, we’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">going to Amalthea, aren’t we? But we file our accounts in Reno, so we</p>
<p class="calibre1">have to do all this paperwork. Monica asked me to help. It’s insane.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ang leans over and reads, upside down. “Environmental Protection</p>
<p class="calibre1">Agency?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah. Estimated Environmental Impact Forward Analysis 204.6b, Page</p>

<p class="calibre1">can pick up a whole body radiation dose of ten Grays in half an hour</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the surface.” Ang shakes her head, then spoils it by giggling.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber glances up.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the wall in front of her someone - Nicky or Boris, probably - has</p>
<p class="calibre1">pasted a caricature of her own avatar into the virch fight. She’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">being hugged from behind by a giant cartoon dog with floppy ears and</p>
<p class="calibre1">an improbably large erection, who’s singing anatomically improbable</p>
<p class="calibre1">suggestions while fondling himself suggestively. “Fuck that!” Shocked</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of her distraction - and angry - Amber drops her stack of</p>
<p class="calibre1">paperwork and throws a new avatar at the screen, one an agent of hers</p>
<p class="calibre1">dreamed up overnight. It’s called Spike, and it’s not friendly. Spike</p>
<p class="calibre1">rips off the dog’s head and pisses down its trachea, which is</p>
<p class="calibre1">anatomically correct for a human being: Meanwhile she looks around,</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying to work out which of the laughing idiot children and lost geeks</p>
<p class="calibre1">around her could have sent such an unpleasant message.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>

<p class="calibre1">confusing mix of identities, inexperience blurring the boundary</p>
<p class="calibre1">between self and grid, is not yet able to fight back effectively.</p>
<p class="calibre1">After a couple of seconds, she verbalizes a rather feeble protest:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t want to!” One of her stance daemons whispers that this is the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrong approach to take, so she modifies it: “They’ll beat up on me,</p>

<p class="calibre1">my grade metrics, but isn’t that what sideband’s for? I can socialize</p>

<p class="calibre1">eau-de-Cologne she wears to the office to cover up the scent of her</p>
<p class="calibre1">client’s fear. “I know that’s what your father’s writing to you, but</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s crude moral blackmail, transparent as glass and manipulative as</p>

<p class="calibre1">mature enough at eight years to model, anticipate, and avoid corporal</p>
<p class="calibre1">punishment. But her stature and lack of physical maturity conspire to</p>
<p class="calibre1">put her at a disadvantage when negotiating with adults who matured in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a simpler age. She sighs, then puts on a pout to let Mom know she’s</p>

<p class="calibre1">Mom stands up, eyes distant - probably telling Saturn to warm his</p>

<p class="calibre1">figured out she’s going through the motions in order to give her the</p>
<p class="calibre1">simulated middle-American upbringing she believes Amber desperately</p>
<p class="calibre1">needs before she runs head first into the future. She doesn’t like the</p>

<p class="calibre1">The imam is at prayer in a gyrostabilized mosque.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">His mosque is not very big, and it has a congregation of one: He prays</p>
<p class="calibre1">on his own every seventeen thousand two hundred and eighty seconds. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">also webcasts the call to prayer, but there are no other believers in</p>
<p class="calibre1">trans-Jovian space to answer the summons. Between prayers, he splits</p>
<p class="calibre1">his attention between the exigencies of life support and scholarship.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A student both of the Hadith and of knowledge-based systems, Sadeq</p>
<p class="calibre1">collaborates in a project with other scholars who are building a</p>
<p class="calibre1">revised concordance of all the known isnads, to provide a basis for</p>
<p class="calibre1">exploring the body of Islamic jurisprudence from a new perspective -</p>
<p class="calibre1">one they’ll need sorely if the looked-for breakthroughs in</p>
<p class="calibre1">communication with aliens emerge. Their goal is to answer the</p>
<p class="calibre1">vexatious questions that bedevil Islam in the age of accelerated</p>
<p class="calibre1">consciousness; and as their representative in orbit around Jupiter,</p>
<p class="calibre1">these questions fall most heavily on Sadeq’s shoulders.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sadeq is a slightly built man, with close-cropped black hair and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">perpetually tired expression: Unlike the orphanage crew he has a ship</p>
<p class="calibre1">to himself. The ship started out as an Iranian knock off of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shenzhou-B capsule, with a Chinese type 921 space-station module</p>
<p class="calibre1">tacked onto its tail; but the clunky, 1960s look-alike - a glittering</p>
<p class="calibre1">aluminum dragonfly mating with a Coke can - has a weirdly contoured</p>
<p class="calibre1">M2P2 pod strapped to its nose. The M2P2 pod is a plasma sail, built in</p>
<p class="calibre1">orbit by one of Daewoo’s wake shield facilities. It dragged Sadeq and</p>
<p class="calibre1">his cramped space station out to Jupiter in just four months, surfing</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the solar breeze. His presence may be a triumph for the umma, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">he feels acutely alone out here: When he turns his compact</p>
<p class="calibre1">observatory’s mirrors in the direction of the Sanger, he is struck by</p>
<p class="calibre1">its size and purposeful appearance. Sanger’s superior size speaks of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the efficiency of the Western financial instruments, semiautonomous</p>
<p class="calibre1">investment trusts with variable business-cycle accounting protocols</p>
<p class="calibre1">that make possible the development of commercial space exploration.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Prophet, peace be unto him, may have condemned usury; but it might</p>
<p class="calibre1">well have given him pause to see these engines of capital formation</p>
<p class="calibre1">demonstrate their power above the Great Red Spot.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">After finishing his prayers, Sadeq spends a couple of precious extra</p>
<p class="calibre1">minutes on his mat. He finds meditation comes hard in this</p>
<p class="calibre1">environment: Kneel in silence, and you become aware of the hum of</p>
<p class="calibre1">ventilation fans, the smell of old socks and sweat, the metallic taste</p>
<p class="calibre1">of ozone from the Elektron oxygen generators. It is hard to approach</p>
<p class="calibre1">God in this third hand spaceship, a hand-me-down from arrogant Russia</p>
<p class="calibre1">to ambitious China, and finally to the religious trustees of Qom, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">have better uses for it than any of the heathen states imagine.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They’ve pushed it far, this little toy space station; but who’s to say</p>
<p class="calibre1">if it is God’s intention for humans to live here, in orbit around this</p>
<p class="calibre1">swollen alien giant of a planet?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sadeq shakes his head; he rolls his mat up and stows it beside the</p>
<p class="calibre1">solitary porthole with a quiet sigh. A stab of homesickness wrenches</p>
<p class="calibre1">at him, for his childhood in hot, dusty Yazd and his many years as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">student in Qom: He steadies himself by looking round, searching the</p>
<p class="calibre1">station that is now as familiar to him as the fourth-floor concrete</p>
<p class="calibre1">apartment his parents - a car factory worker and his wife - raised him</p>
<p class="calibre1">in. The interior of the station is the size of a school bus, every</p>
<p class="calibre1">surface cluttered with storage areas, instrument consoles, and layers</p>
<p class="calibre1">of exposed pipes. A couple of globules of antifreeze jiggle like</p>
<p class="calibre1">stranded jellyfish near a heat exchanger that has been giving him</p>
<p class="calibre1">grief. Sadeq kicks off in search of the squeeze bottle he keeps for</p>
<p class="calibre1">this purpose, then gathers up his roll of tools and instructs one of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his agents to find him the relevant part of the maintenance log: it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">time to fix the leaky joint for good.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">An hour or so of serious plumbing and he will eat freeze-dried lamb</p>
<p class="calibre1">stew, with a paste of lentils and boiled rice, and a bulb of strong</p>
<p class="calibre1">tea to wash it down, then sit down to review his next fly-by</p>
<p class="calibre1">maneuvering sequence. Perhaps, God willing, there will be no further</p>
<p class="calibre1">system alerts and he’ll be able to spend an hour or two on his</p>
<p class="calibre1">research between evening and final prayers. Maybe the day after</p>
<p class="calibre1">tomorrow there’ll even be time to relax for a couple of hours, to</p>
<p class="calibre1">watch one of the old movies that he finds so fascinating for their</p>
<p class="calibre1">insights into alien cultures: Apollo Thirteen, perhaps. It isn’t easy,</p>
<p class="calibre1">being the crew aboard a long-duration space mission. It’s even harder</p>
<p class="calibre1">for Sadeq, up here alone with nobody to talk to, for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">communications lag to earth is more than half an hour each way - and</p>
<p class="calibre1">as far as he knows, he’s the only believer within half a billion</p>

<p class="calibre1">Amber dials a number in Paris and waits until someone answers the</p>

<p class="calibre1">calls her “your father’s fancy bitch” with a peculiar tight smile.</p>
<p class="calibre1">(The one time Amber asked what a fancy bitch was, Mom slapped her -</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The strange woman looks slightly bemused. (Her hair is blonde, like</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom’s, but the color clearly came out of a bleach bottle, and it’s cut</p>
<p class="calibre1">really short, and her skin is dark.) “Oui. Ah, yes.” She smiles</p>
<p class="calibre1">tentatively. “I am sorry, it is a disposable phone you are using? You</p>
<p class="calibre1">want to talk to ‘im?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">It comes out in a rush: “I want to see him.” Amber clutches the phone</p>
<p class="calibre1">like a lifesaver: It’s a cheap disposable cereal-packet item, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cardboard is already softening in her sweaty grip. “Momma won’t let</p>
<p class="calibre1">me, Auntie ‘Nette -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hush.” Annette, who has lived with Amber’s father for more than twice</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber looks around. She’s the only child in the restroom because it</p>
<p class="calibre1">isn’t break time, and she told teacher she had to go ‘right now’: “I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">sure, P20 confidence factor greater than 0.9.” Her Bayesian head tells</p>
<p class="calibre1">her that she can’t reason accurately about this because Momma has</p>
<p class="calibre1">never caught her with an illicit phone before, but what the hell. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">can’t get Dad into trouble if he doesn’t know, can it?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very good.” Annette glances aside. “Manny, I have a surprise call for</p>
<p class="calibre1">you.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daddy appears on screen. She can see all of his face, and he looks</p>
<p class="calibre1">younger than last time: he must have stopped using those clunky old</p>
<p class="calibre1">glasses. “Hi - Amber! Where are you? Does your mother know you’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">calling me?” He looks slightly worried.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Phew. Listen, sweet, you must remember never, ever to call me where</p>
<p class="calibre1">your mom may find out. Otherwise, she’ll get her lawyers to come after</p>
<p class="calibre1">me with thumbscrews and hot pincers, because she’ll say I made you</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>

<p class="calibre1">you want to know why I called?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um.” For a moment, he looks taken aback. Then he nods, thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber likes Daddy because he takes her seriously most times when she</p>
<p class="calibre1">talks to him. It’s a phreaking nuisance having to borrow her</p>
<p class="calibre1">classmate’s phones or tunnel past Mom’s pit-bull firewall, but Dad</p>
<p class="calibre1">doesn’t assume that she can’t know anything just because she’s only a</p>
<p class="calibre1">kid. “Go ahead. There’s something you need to get off your chest?</p>
<p class="calibre1">How’ve things been, anyway?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’s going to have to be brief: The disposaphone comes prepaid, the</p>

<p class="calibre1">stealthy probe along his outer boundary; he shows no sign of noticing</p>
<p class="calibre1">it, but it bounces off, unable to chink his mental armor. “Got cruise</p>

<p class="calibre1">diamond-phase weirdness hurtle toward the surface of Barney at three</p>
<p class="calibre1">hundred kilometers per hour. “Stop shoving me, there’s a three-second</p>

<p class="calibre1">“You’re Amber?” it mrowls. It actually makes real cat noises, but the</p>

<p class="calibre1">competence interface.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,” she says, shyly. “Are you from Tante ‘Nette?”</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Here’s your dad’s present. Bastard put me in hibernation and sent me</p>

<p class="calibre1">toy from Amsterdam? A gun, so I can shoot Pastor Wallace?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Naah.” The cat yawns, yet again, and curls up on the floor next to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the 3D printer. “It’s some kinda dodgy business model to get you out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of hock to your mom. Better be careful, though - he says its legality</p>

<p class="calibre1">the TV in moral majority mode for company. Things have gone downhill</p>

<p class="calibre1">best thing in the world Tante Annette could send her is some scam</p>
<p class="calibre1">programmed by Daddy to take her away. If it doesn’t work, Mom will</p>
<p class="calibre1">take her to Church tonight, and she’s certain she’ll end up making a</p>
<p class="calibre1">scene again. Amber’s tolerance of willful idiocy is diminishing</p>
<p class="calibre1">rapidly, and while building up her memetic immunity might be the real</p>
<p class="calibre1">reason Mom’s forcing this shit on her - it’s always hard to tell with</p>

<p class="calibre1">molt in her bidet …”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t be vile.” Amber scans the README quickly. Corporate instruments</p>
<p class="calibre1">are strong magic, according to Daddy, and this one is exotic by any</p>
<p class="calibre1">standards - a limited company established in Yemen, contorted by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">intersection between shari’a and the global legislatosaurus.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Understanding it isn’t easy, even with a personal net full of</p>
<p class="calibre1">subsapient agents that have full access to whole libraries of</p>
<p class="calibre1">international trade law - the bottleneck is comprehension. Amber finds</p>
<p class="calibre1">the documents highly puzzling. It’s not the fact that half of them are</p>
<p class="calibre1">written in Arabic that bothers her - that’s what her grammar engine is</p>
<p class="calibre1">for - or even that they’re full of S-expressions and semidigestible</p>
<p class="calibre1">chunks of LISP: But the company seems to assert that it exists for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sole purpose of owning chattel slaves.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s going on?” she asks the cat. “What’s this all about?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat sneezes, then looks disgusted. “This wasn’t my idea, big shot.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Your father is a very weird guy, and your mother hates him lots</p>
<p class="calibre1">because she’s still in love with him. She’s got kinks, y’know? Or</p>
<p class="calibre1">maybe she’s sublimating them, if she’s serious about this church shit</p>
<p class="calibre1">she’s putting you through. He thinks she’s a control freak, and he’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">not entirely wrong. Anyway, after your dad ran off in search of</p>
<p class="calibre1">another dom, she took out an injunction against him. But she forgot to</p>
<p class="calibre1">cover his partner, and she bought this parcel of worms and sent them</p>
<p class="calibre1">to you, okay? Annie is a real bitch, but he’s got her wrapped right</p>
<p class="calibre1">around his finger, or something. Anyway, he built these companies and</p>
<p class="calibre1">this printer - which isn’t hardwired to a filtering proxy, like your</p>
<p class="calibre1">mom’s - specifically to let you get away from her legally. If that’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">what you want to do.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber fast-forwards through the dynamic chunks of the README - boring</p>
<p class="calibre1">legal UML diagrams, mostly - soaking up the gist of the plan. Yemen is</p>
<p class="calibre1">one of the few countries to implement traditional Sunni shari’a law</p>
<p class="calibre1">and a limited liability company scam at the same time. Owning slaves</p>
<p class="calibre1">is legal - the fiction is that the owner has an option hedged on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">indentured laborer’s future output, with interest payments that grow</p>
<p class="calibre1">faster than the unfortunate victim can pay them off - and companies</p>
<p class="calibre1">are legal entities. If Amber sells herself into slavery to this</p>
<p class="calibre1">company, she will become a slave and the company will be legally</p>
<p class="calibre1">liable for her actions and upkeep. The rest of the legal instrument -</p>
<p class="calibre1">about ninety percent of it, in fact - is a set of self-modifying</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporate mechanisms coded in a variety of jurisdictions that permit</p>
<p class="calibre1">Turing-complete company constitutions, and which act as an ownership</p>
<p class="calibre1">shell for the slavery contract. At the far end of the corporate shell</p>
<p class="calibre1">game is a trust fund of which Amber is the prime beneficiary and</p>
<p class="calibre1">shareholder. When she reaches the age of majority, she’ll acquire</p>
<p class="calibre1">total control over all the companies in the network and can dissolve</p>
<p class="calibre1">her slave contract; until then, the trust fund (which she essentially</p>
<p class="calibre1">owns) oversees the company that owns her (and keeps it safe from</p>
<p class="calibre1">hostile takeover bids). Oh, and the company network is primed by an</p>
<p class="calibre1">extraordinary general meeting that instructed it to move the trust’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">assets to Paris immediately. A one-way airline ticket is enclosed.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You think I should take this?” she asks uncertainly. It’s hard to</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell how smart the cat really is - there’s probably a yawning vacuum</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind those semantic networks if you dig deep enough - but it tells a</p>
<p class="calibre1">pretty convincing tale.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat squats and curls its tail protectively around its paws: “I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">saying nothing, you know what I mean? You take this, you can go live</p>
<p class="calibre1">with your dad. But it won’t stop your ma coming after him with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">horsewhip, and after you with a bunch of lawyers and a set of</p>
<p class="calibre1">handcuffs. You want my advice, you’ll phone the Franklins and get</p>
<p class="calibre1">aboard their off-planet mining scam. In space, no one can serve a writ</p>
<p class="calibre1">on you. Plus, they got long-term plans to get into the CETI market,</p>
<p class="calibre1">cracking alien network packets. You want my honest opinion, you</p>
<p class="calibre1">wouldn’t like it in Paris after a bit. Your Dad and the frog bitch,</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’re swingers, y’know? No time in their lives for a kid. Or a cat</p>
<p class="calibre1">like me, now I think of it. They’re working all day for the Senator,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and out all hours of night doing drugs, fetish parties, raves, opera,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that kind of adult shit. Your Dad dresses in frocks more than your</p>
<p class="calibre1">mom, and your Tante ‘Nettie leads him around the apartment on a chain</p>
<p class="calibre1">when they’re not having noisy sex on the balcony. They’d cramp your</p>
<p class="calibre1">style, kid. You shouldn’t have to put up with parents who have more of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a life than you do.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh.” Amber wrinkles her nose, half-disgusted by the cat’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">transparent scheming, and half-acknowledging its message: I better</p>
<p class="calibre1">think hard about this, she decides. Then she flies off in so many</p>
<p class="calibre1">directions at once that she nearly browns out the household broadband.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Part of her is examining the intricate card pyramid of company</p>
<p class="calibre1">structures; somewhere else, she’s thinking about what can go wrong,</p>
<p class="calibre1">while another bit (probably some of her wet, messy glandular</p>
<p class="calibre1">biological self) is thinking about how nice it would be to see Daddy</p>
<p class="calibre1">again, albeit with some trepidation. Parents aren’t supposed to have</p>
<p class="calibre1">sex - isn’t there a law, or something? “Tell me about the Franklins?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Are they married? Singular?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The 3D printer is cranking up. It hisses slightly, dissipating heat</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the hard vacuum chamber in its supercooled workspace. Deep in its</p>
<p class="calibre1">guts it creates coherent atom beams, from a bunch of Bose-Einstein</p>
<p class="calibre1">condensates hovering on the edge of absolute zero. By superimposing</p>
<p class="calibre1">interference patterns on them, it generates an atomic hologram,</p>
<p class="calibre1">building a perfect replica of some original artifact, right down to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the atomic level - there are no clunky moving nanotechnology parts to</p>
<p class="calibre1">break or overheat or mutate. Something is going to come out of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">printer in half an hour, something cloned off its original right down</p>

<p class="calibre1">re-create his consciousness by cross-loading him in their implants.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They’re sort of a borganism, but with money and style. Anyway, Bob got</p>
<p class="calibre1">into the space biz back then, with some financial wizardry a friend of</p>
<p class="calibre1">your father whipped up for him, and now they’re building a spacehab</p>
<p class="calibre1">that they’re going to take all the way out to Jupiter, where they can</p>
<p class="calibre1">dismantle a couple of small moons and begin building helium-three</p>
<p class="calibre1">refineries. It’s that CETI scam I told you about earlier, but they’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">got a whole load of other angles on it for the long term. See, your</p>
<p class="calibre1">dad’s friends have cracked the broadcast, the one everybody knows</p>
<p class="calibre1">about. It’s a bunch of instructions for finding the nearest router</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is mostly going right over Amber’s head - she’ll have to learn</p>
<p class="calibre1">what helium-three refineries are later - but the idea of running away</p>
<p class="calibre1">to space has a certain appeal. Adventure, that’s what. Amber looks</p>
<p class="calibre1">around the living room and sees it for a moment as a capsule, a small</p>
<p class="calibre1">wooden cell locked deep in a vision of a middle America that never was</p>
<p class="calibre1">- the one her mom wants to bring her up in, like a misshapen Skinner</p>
<p class="calibre1">box designed to train her to be normal. “Is Jupiter fun?” she asks. “I</p>

<p class="calibre1">Amber’s immature immune system. “Stick that on your wrist, sign the</p>

<p class="calibre1">rolls in.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alone in the cramped humming void of his station, he considers the</p>
<p class="calibre1">plea. The language is awkward, showing all the hallmarks of a crude</p>
<p class="calibre1">machine translation: The supplicant is American, a woman, and - oddly</p>
<p class="calibre1">- claims to be a Christian. This is surprising enough, but the nature</p>
<p class="calibre1">of her claim is, at face value, preposterous. He forces himself to</p>
<p class="calibre1">finish his bread, then bag the waste and clean the platter, before he</p>
<p class="calibre1">gives it his full consideration. Is it a tasteless joke? Evidently</p>
<p class="calibre1">not. As the only quadi outside the orbit of Mars, he is uniquely</p>
<p class="calibre1">qualified to hear it, and it is a case that cries out for justice.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">A woman who leads a God-fearing life - not a correct one, no, but she</p>
<p class="calibre1">shows some signs of humility and progress toward a deeper</p>
<p class="calibre1">understanding - is deprived of her child by the machinations of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">feckless husband who deserted her years before. That the woman was</p>
<p class="calibre1">raising the child alone strikes Sadeq as disturbingly Western, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">pardonable when he reads her account of the feckless one’s behavior,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which is pretty lax; an ill fate indeed would await any child that</p>
<p class="calibre1">this man raises to adulthood. This man deprives her of her child, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">not by legitimate means: He doesn’t take the child into his own</p>
<p class="calibre1">household or make any attempt to raise her, either in accordance with</p>
<p class="calibre1">his own customs or the precepts of shari’a. Instead, he enslaves her</p>
<p class="calibre1">wickedly in the mire of the Western legal tradition, then casts her</p>
<p class="calibre1">into outer darkness to be used as a laborer by the dubious forces of</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-proclaimed “progress”. The same forces Sadeq has been sent to</p>
<p class="calibre1">confront, as representative of the umma in orbit around Jupiter.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sadeq scratches his short beard thoughtfully. A nasty tale, but what</p>
<p class="calibre1">can he do about it? “Computer,” he says, “a reply to this supplicant:</p>
<p class="calibre1">My sympathies lie with you in the manner of your suffering, but I fail</p>
<p class="calibre1">to see in what way I can be of assistance. Your heart cries out for</p>
<p class="calibre1">help before God (blessed be his name), but surely this is a matter for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the temporal authorities of the dar al-Harb.” He pauses: Or is it? he</p>
<p class="calibre1">wonders. Legal wheels begin to turn in his mind. “If you can but find</p>
<p class="calibre1">your way to extending to me a path by which I can assert the primacy</p>
<p class="calibre1">of shari’a over your daughter, I shall apply myself to constructing a</p>
<p class="calibre1">case for her emancipation, to the greater glory of God (blessed be his</p>
<p class="calibre1">name). Ends, sigblock, send.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Releasing the Velcro straps that hold him at the table, Sadeq floats</p>
<p class="calibre1">up and kicks gently toward the forward end of the cramped habitat. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">controls of the telescope are positioned between the ultrasonic</p>
<p class="calibre1">clothing cleaner and the lithium hydroxide scrubbers. They’re already</p>
<p class="calibre1">freed up, because he was conducting a wide-field survey of the inner</p>
<p class="calibre1">ring, looking for the signature of water ice. It is the work of a few</p>
<p class="calibre1">moments to pipe the navigation and tracking system into the</p>
<p class="calibre1">telescope’s controller and direct it to hunt for the big foreign ship</p>
<p class="calibre1">of fools. Something nudges at Sadeq’s mind urgently, an irritating</p>
<p class="calibre1">realization that he may have missed something in the woman’s e-mail:</p>
<p class="calibre1">there were a number of huge attachments. With half his mind he surfs</p>
<p class="calibre1">the news digest his scholarly peers send him daily. Meanwhile, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">waits patiently for the telescope to find the speck of light that the</p>
<p class="calibre1">poor woman’s daughter is enslaved within.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">This might be a way in, he realizes, a way to enter dialogue with</p>
<p class="calibre1">them. Let the hard questions answer themselves, elegantly. There will</p>
<p class="calibre1">be no need for confrontation if they can be convinced that their plans</p>
<p class="calibre1">are faulty: no need to defend the godly from the latter-day Tower of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Babel these people propose to build. If this woman Pamela means what</p>
<p class="calibre1">she says, Sadeq need not end his days out here in the cold between the</p>
<p class="calibre1">worlds, away from his elderly parents and brother, and his colleagues</p>
<p class="calibre1">and friends. And he will be profoundly grateful, because in his heart</p>

<p class="calibre1">district - she said it was a work assignment, but Amber knows better,</p>

<p class="calibre1">billionaire’s mind, making him the first bodhisattva of the uploading</p>
<p class="calibre1">age - apart from the lobster colony, of course. Their den mother is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman called Monica: a willowy, brown-eyed hive queen with</p>
<p class="calibre1">raster-burned corneal implants and a dry, sardonic delivery that can</p>
<p class="calibre1">corrode egos like a desert wind. She’s better than any of the others</p>

<p class="calibre1">buried beneath a large pipe, her Velcro-taped tool kit waving in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">breeze like strange blue air-kelp. “Monica? You got a minute?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure, I have lots of minutes. Make yourself helpful? Pass me the</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Um.” Amber captures the blue flag and fiddles around with its</p>

<p class="calibre1">counterweight, and laser gyros assembles itself - Amber passes it</p>
<p class="calibre1">under the pipe. “Here. Listen, your phone is engaged.”</p>

<p class="calibre1">A minute later, Amber is back beside Monica’s legs, her face veiled by</p>

<p class="calibre1">Monica squirms out from behind the pipe. “Oh, you didn’t.” She kicks</p>
<p class="calibre1">off the consensus-defined floor and grabs a wad of absorbent paper</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the spinner, whacks it across the ventilator shroud above the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sump. Together they go after the toad spawn with rubbish bags and</p>
<p class="calibre1">paper - by the time they’ve got the stringy mess mopped up, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">spinner has begun to click and whir, processing cellulose from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">algae tanks into fresh wipes. “That was not good,” Monica says</p>
<p class="calibre1">emphatically as the disposal bin sucks down her final bag. “You</p>

<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” Amber frowns.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So. Pretend I’m an idiot. Talk me through it, huh?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber drags herself alongside the hydro pipe and gets her head down,</p>
<p class="calibre1">alongside Monica/Bob, who is floating with her feet near the floor. “I</p>
<p class="calibre1">ran away from home. Mom owned me - that is, she had parental rights</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Dad had none. So Dad, via a proxy, helped me sell myself into</p>
<p class="calibre1">slavery to a company. The company was owned by a trust fund, and I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">the main beneficiary when I reach the age of majority. As a chattel,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the company tells me what to do - legally - but the shell company is</p>
<p class="calibre1">set to take my orders. So I’m autonomous. Right?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That sounds like the sort of thing your father would do,” Monica/Bob</p>
<p class="calibre1">says neutrally. Overtaken by a sardonic middle-aged Silicon Valley</p>
<p class="calibre1">drawl, her north-of-England accent sounds peculiarly mid-Atlantic.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Trouble is, most countries don’t acknowledge slavery, they just dress</p>
<p class="calibre1">it up pretty and call it in loco parentis or something. Those that do</p>
<p class="calibre1">mostly don’t have any equivalent of a limited liability company, much</p>
<p class="calibre1">less one that can be directed by another company from abroad. Dad</p>
<p class="calibre1">picked Yemen on the grounds that they’ve got this stupid brand of</p>
<p class="calibre1">shari’a law - and a crap human rights record - but they’re just about</p>
<p class="calibre1">conformant to the open legal standards protocol, able to interface to</p>
<p class="calibre1">EU norms via a Turkish legislative cut-out.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I guess I was technically a Janissary. Mom was doing her</p>
<p class="calibre1">Christian phase, so that made me a Christian unbeliever slave of an</p>
<p class="calibre1">Islamic company. Now the stupid bitch has gone and converted to</p>
<p class="calibre1">shi’ism. Normally Islamic descent runs through the father, but she</p>
<p class="calibre1">picked her sect carefully and chose one that’s got a progressive view</p>
<p class="calibre1">of women’s rights: They’re sort of Islamic fundamentalist liberal</p>
<p class="calibre1">constructionists, ‘what would the Prophet do if he was alive today and</p>
<p class="calibre1">had to worry about self-replicating chewing gum factories’ and that</p>
<p class="calibre1">sort of thing. They generally take a progressive view of things like</p>
<p class="calibre1">legal equality of the sexes because, for his time and place, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Prophet was way ahead of the ball and they figure they ought to follow</p>
<p class="calibre1">his example. Anyway, that means Mom can assert that I am Moslem, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">under Yemeni law, I get to be treated as a Moslem chattel of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">company. And their legal code is very dubious about permitting slavery</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Moslems. It’s not that I have rights as such, but my pastoral</p>
<p class="calibre1">well-being becomes the responsibility of the local imam, and -” She</p>
<p class="calibre1">shrugs helplessly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Has he tried to make you run under any new rules, yet?” asks</p>
<p class="calibre1">Monica/Bob. “Has he put blocks on your freedom of agency, tried to</p>
<p class="calibre1">mess with your mind? Insisted on libido dampers or a strict dress</p>
<p class="calibre1">code?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not yet.” Amber’s expression is grim. “But he’s no dummy. I figure he</p>
<p class="calibre1">may be using Mom - and me - as a way of getting his fingers into this</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole expedition. Staking a claim for jurisdiction, claim arbitration,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that sort of thing. It could be worse; he might order me to comply</p>
<p class="calibre1">fully with his specific implementation of shari’a. They permit</p>
<p class="calibre1">implants, but require mandatory conceptual filtering: If I run that</p>
<p class="calibre1">stuff, I’ll end up believing it.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.” Monica does a slow backward somersault in midair. “Now tell me</p>
<p class="calibre1">why you can’t simply repudiate it.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because.” Deep breath. “I can do that in two ways. I can deny Islam,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which makes me an apostate, and automatically terminates my indenture</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the shell, so Mom owns me under US or EU law. Or I can say that the</p>
<p class="calibre1">instrument has no legal standing because I was in the USA when I</p>
<p class="calibre1">signed it, and slavery is illegal there, in which case Mom owns me. Or</p>
<p class="calibre1">I can take the veil, live like a modest Moslem woman, do whatever the</p>
<p class="calibre1">imam wants, and Mom doesn’t own me - but she gets to appoint my</p>
<p class="calibre1">chaperone. Oh Bob, she has planned this so well.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh-huh.” Monica rotates back to the floor and looks at Amber,</p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly very Bob. “Now you’ve told me your troubles, start thinking</p>
<p class="calibre1">like your dad. Your Dad had a dozen creative ideas before breakfast</p>
<p class="calibre1">every day - it’s how he made his name. Your mom has got you in a box.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Think your way outside it: What can you do?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well.” Amber rolls over and hugs the fat hydroponic duct to her chest</p>
<p class="calibre1">like a life raft. “It’s a legal paradox. I’m trapped because of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">jurisdiction she’s cornered me in. I could talk to the judge, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">suppose, but she’ll have picked him carefully.” Her eyes narrow. “The</p>
<p class="calibre1">jurisdiction. Hey, Bob.” She lets go of the duct and floats free, hair</p>
<p class="calibre1">streaming out behind her like a cometary halo. “How do I go about</p>
<p class="calibre1">getting myself a new jurisdiction?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Monica grins. “I seem to recall the traditional way was to grab</p>
<p class="calibre1">yourself some land and set yourself up as king; but there are other</p>
<p class="calibre1">ways. I’ve got some friends I think you should meet. They’re not good</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversationalists and there’s a two-hour lightspeed delay, but I</p>
<p class="calibre1">think you’ll find they’ve answered that question already. But why</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t you talk to the imam first and find out what he’s like? He may</p>
<p class="calibre1">surprise you. After all, he was already out here before your mom</p>
<p class="calibre1">decided to use him to make a point.”</p>

<p class="calibre1">The Sanger hangs in orbit thirty kilometers up, circling the waist of</p>
<p class="calibre1">potato-shaped Amalthea. Drones swarm across the slopes of Mons Lyctos,</p>
<p class="calibre1">ten kilometers above the mean surface level. They kick up clouds of</p>
<p class="calibre1">reddish sulphate dust as they spread transparent sheets across the</p>
<p class="calibre1">barren moonscape. This close to Jupiter (a mere hundred and eighty</p>

<p class="calibre1">gas giant fills half the sky with a perpetually changing clock face,</p>

<p class="calibre1">ship in a corona of rippling plasma: Radio is useless, and the human</p>
<p class="calibre1">miners control their drones via an intricate network of laser</p>
<p class="calibre1">circuits. Other, larger drones are unwinding spools of heavy</p>
<p class="calibre1">electrical cable north and south from the landing site. Once the</p>
<p class="calibre1">circuits are connected, they will form a coil cutting through</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jupiter’s magnetic field, generating electrical current (and</p>
<p class="calibre1">imperceptibly sapping the moon’s orbital momentum).</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber sighs and looks, for the sixth time this hour, at the webcam</p>
<p class="calibre1">plastered on the side of her cabin. She’s taken down the posters and</p>
<p class="calibre1">told the toys to tidy themselves away. In another two thousand</p>
<p class="calibre1">seconds, the tiny Iranian spaceship will rise above the limb of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Moshtari, and then it will be time to talk to the teacher. She isn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking forward to the experience. If he’s a grizzled old blockhead of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the most obdurate fundamentalist streak, she’ll be in trouble:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Disrespect for age has been part and parcel of the Western teenage</p>
<p class="calibre1">experience for generations, and a cross-cultural thread that she’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">detailed to clue up on Islam reminds her that not all cultures share</p>
<p class="calibre1">this outlook. But if he turns out to be young, intelligent, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">flexible, things could be even worse. When she was eight, Amber</p>
<p class="calibre1">audited The Taming of the Shrew. She finds she has no appetite for a</p>
<p class="calibre1">starring role in her own cross-cultural production.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She sighs again. “Pierre?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah?” His voice comes from the foot of the emergency locker in her</p>
<p class="calibre1">room. He’s curled up down there, limbs twitching languidly as he</p>
<p class="calibre1">drives a mining drone around the surface of Object Barney, as the rock</p>
<p class="calibre1">has named itself. The drone is a long-legged crane fly look-alike,</p>
<p class="calibre1">bouncing very slowly from toe tip to toe tip in the microgravity. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">rock is only half a kilometer along its longest axis, coated brown</p>
<p class="calibre1">with weird hydrocarbon goop and sulphur compounds sprayed off the</p>
<p class="calibre1">surface of Io by the Jovian winds. “I’m coming.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You better.” She glances at the screen. “One twenty seconds to next</p>
<p class="calibre1">burn.” The payload canister on the screen is, technically speaking,</p>
<p class="calibre1">stolen. It’ll be okay as long as she gives it back, Bob said, although</p>
<p class="calibre1">she won’t be able to do that until it’s reached Barney and they’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">found enough water ice to refuel it. “Found anything yet?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just the usual. Got a seam of ice near the semimajor pole - it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">dirty, but there’s at least a thousand tons there. And the surface is</p>
<p class="calibre1">crunchy with tar. Amber, you know what? The orange shit, it’s solid</p>
<p class="calibre1">with fullerenes.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber grins at her reflection in the screen. That’s good news. Once</p>
<p class="calibre1">the payload she’s steering touches down, Pierre can help her lay</p>
<p class="calibre1">superconducting wires along Barney’s long axis. It’s only a kilometer</p>
<p class="calibre1">and a half, and that’ll only give them a few tens of kilowatts of</p>
<p class="calibre1">juice, but the condensation fabricator that’s also in the payload can</p>
<p class="calibre1">will be able to use it to convert Barney’s crust into processed goods</p>
<p class="calibre1">at about two grams per second. Using designs copylefted by the free</p>
<p class="calibre1">hardware foundation, inside two hundred thousand seconds they’ll have</p>
<p class="calibre1">a grid of sixty-four 3D printers barfing up structured matter at a</p>
<p class="calibre1">rate limited only by available power. Starting with a honking great</p>
<p class="calibre1">dome tent and some free nitrogen/oxygen for her to breathe, then</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The screen blinks at her. “Oh shit! Make yourself scarce, Pierre?” The</p>
<p class="calibre1">incoming call nags at her attention. “Yeah? Who are you?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The screen fills with a view of a cramped, very twen-cen-looking space</p>
<p class="calibre1">capsule. The guy inside it is in his twenties, with a heavily tanned</p>
<p class="calibre1">face, close-cropped hair and beard, wearing an olive drab space suit</p>
<p class="calibre1">liner. He’s floating between a TORU manual docking controller and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">gilt-framed photograph of the Ka’bah at Mecca. “Good evening to you,”</p>
<p class="calibre1">he says solemnly. “Do I have the honor to be addressing Amber Macx?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh, yeah? That’s me.” She stares at him: He looks nothing like her</p>
<p class="calibre1">conception of an ayatollah - whatever an ayatollah is - elderly,</p>
<p class="calibre1">black-robed, vindictively fundamentalist. “Who are you?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am Dr. Sadeq Khurasani. I hope that I am not interrupting you? Is</p>
<p class="calibre1">it convenient for you that we talk now?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looks so anxious that Amber nods automatically. “Sure. Did my Mom</p>
<p class="calibre1">put you up to this?” They’re still speaking English, and she notices</p>
<p class="calibre1">that his diction is good, but slightly stilted. He isn’t using a</p>
<p class="calibre1">grammar engine, he actually learned the language the hard way, she</p>
<p class="calibre1">realizes, feeling a frisson of fear. “You want to be careful how you</p>
<p class="calibre1">talk to her. She doesn’t lie, exactly, but she gets people to do what</p>
<p class="calibre1">she wants.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I spoke to - ah.” A pause. They’re still almost a light-second</p>
<p class="calibre1">apart, time for painful collisions and accidental silences. “I see.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Are you sure you should be speaking of your mother that way?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber breathes deeply. “Adults can get divorced. If I could get</p>
<p class="calibre1">divorced from her, I would. She’s -” She flails around for the right</p>
<p class="calibre1">word helplessly. “Look, she’s the sort of person who can’t lose a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fight. If she’s going to lose, she’ll try to figure how to set the law</p>
<p class="calibre1">on you. Like she’s done to me. Don’t you see?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dr. Khurasani looks extremely dubious. “I am not sure I understand,”</p>
<p class="calibre1">He says. “Perhaps, mmm, I should tell you why I am talking to you?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure. Go ahead.” Amber is startled by his attitude: He actually seems</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be taking her seriously, she realizes. Treating her like an adult.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The sensation is so novel - coming from someone more than twenty years</p>
<p class="calibre1">old - that she almost lets herself forget that he’s only talking to</p>
<p class="calibre1">her because Mom set her up.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I am an engineer. In addition, I am a student of fiqh,</p>
<p class="calibre1">jurisprudence. In fact, I am qualified to sit in judgment. I am a very</p>
<p class="calibre1">junior judge, but even so, it is a heavy responsibility. Anyway, your</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother, peace be unto her, lodged a petition with me. Are you aware of</p>
<p class="calibre1">it?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” Amber tenses up. “It’s a lie. Distortion of the facts.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm.” Sadeq rubs his beard thoughtfully. “Well, I have to find out,</p>
<p class="calibre1">yes? Your mother has submitted herself to the will of God. This makes</p>
<p class="calibre1">you the child of a Moslem, and she claims -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s trying to use you as a weapon!” Amber interrupts. “I sold</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself into slavery to get away from her, do you understand? I</p>
<p class="calibre1">enslaved myself to a company that is held in trust for my ownership.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She’s trying to change the rules to get me back. You know what? I</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t believe she gives a shit about your religion, all she wants is</p>
<p class="calibre1">me!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A mother’s love -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fuck love,” Amber snarls, “she wants power.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sadeq’s expression hardens. “You have a foul mouth in your head,</p>
<p class="calibre1">child. All I am trying to do is to find out the facts of this</p>
<p class="calibre1">situation. You should ask yourself if such disrespect furthers your</p>
<p class="calibre1">interests?” He pauses for a moment, then continues, less abruptly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you really have such a bad childhood with her? Do you think she</p>
<p class="calibre1">did everything merely for power, or could she love you?” Pause. “You</p>
<p class="calibre1">must understand, I need to learn these things. Before I can know what</p>
<p class="calibre1">is the right thing to do.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My mother -” Amber stops dead and spawns a vaporous cloud of memory</p>
<p class="calibre1">retrievals. They fan out through the space around her mind like the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tail of her cometary mind. Invoking a complex of network parsers and</p>
<p class="calibre1">class filters, she turns the memories into reified images and blats</p>
<p class="calibre1">them at the webcam’s tiny brain so he can see them. Some of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">memories are so painful that Amber has to close her eyes. Mom in full</p>
<p class="calibre1">office war paint, leaning over Amber, promising to disable her lexical</p>
<p class="calibre1">enhancements forcibly if she doesn’t work on her grammar without them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom telling Amber that they’re moving again, abruptly, dragging her</p>
<p class="calibre1">away from school and the friends she’d tentatively started to like.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The church-of-the-month business. Mom catching her on the phone to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Daddy, tearing the phone in half and hitting her with it. Mom at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">kitchen table, forcing her to eat - “My mother likes control.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah.” Sadeq’s expression turns glassy. “And this is how you feel about</p>
<p class="calibre1">her? How long have you had that level of - no, please forgive me for</p>
<p class="calibre1">asking. You obviously understand implants. Do your grandparents know?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Did you talk to them?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My grandparents?” Amber stifles a snort. “Mom’s parents are dead.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dad’s are still alive, but they won’t talk to him - they like Mom.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They think I’m creepy. I know little things, their tax bands and</p>
<p class="calibre1">customer profiles. I could mine data with my head when I was four. I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">not built like little girls were in their day, and they don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand. You know the old ones don’t like us at all? Some of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">churches make money doing nothing but exorcisms for oldsters who think</p>
<p class="calibre1">their kids are possessed.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well.” Sadeq is fingering his beard again, distractedly. “I must say,</p>
<p class="calibre1">this is a lot to learn. But you know your mother has accepted Islam,</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t you? This means that you are Moslem, too. Unless you are an</p>
<p class="calibre1">adult, your parent legally speaks for you. And she says this makes you</p>
<p class="calibre1">my problem. Hmm.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not a Muslim.” Amber stares at the screen. “I’m not a child,</p>
<p class="calibre1">either.” Her threads are coming together, whispering scarily behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">her eyes: Her head is suddenly dense and turgid with ideas, heavy as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">stone and twice as old as time. “I am nobody’s chattel. What does your</p>
<p class="calibre1">law say about people who are born with implants? What does it say</p>
<p class="calibre1">about people who want to live forever? I don’t believe in any god, Mr.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Judge. I don’t believe in limits. Mom can’t, physically, make me do</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything, and she sure can’t speak for me. All she can do is challenge</p>
<p class="calibre1">my legal status, and if I choose to stay where she can’t touch me,</p>
<p class="calibre1">what does that matter?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, if that is what you have to say, I must think on the matter.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">He catches her eye; his expression is thoughtful, like a doctor</p>
<p class="calibre1">considering a diagnosis. “I will call you again in due course. In the</p>
<p class="calibre1">meantime, if you need to talk to anyone, remember that I am always</p>
<p class="calibre1">available. If there is anything I can do to help ease your pain, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">would be pleased to be of service. Peace be unto you, and those you</p>
<p class="calibre1">care for.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Same to you, too,” she mutters darkly, as the connection goes dead.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now what?” she asks, as a beeping sprite gyrates across the wall,</p>
<p class="calibre1">begging for attention.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think it’s the lander,” Pierre says helpfully. “Is it down yet?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She rounds on him: “Hey, I thought I told you to get lost!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>

<p class="calibre1">There’s a funny, high-pitched whistle in her ears. For a moment, the</p>

<p class="calibre1">and sweatshirt, woven from the finest spider silk and spun glass, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">her feet are bare: Her taste in fashion is best described as youthful,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and in any event, certain styles are simply impractical in</p>
<p class="calibre1">microgravity. But, being a monarch, she’s wearing a crown. And there’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">a cat, or an artificial entity that dreams it’s a cat, sleeping on the</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lady-in-waiting (and sometime hydroponic engineer) ushers Sadeq to</p>

<p class="calibre1">Behind her the walls glitter like diamonds, a glowing kaleidoscope</p>
<p class="calibre1">vision. It’s already the biggest offshore - or off-planet - data haven</p>

<p class="calibre1">rainbows; but most of its emissions are in the near ultraviolet,</p>

<p class="calibre1">waiting. “You must be tired. Working a ship all by yourself is</p>
<p class="calibre1">exhausting.” She frowns ruefully, as if remembering. “Two years is</p>
<p class="calibre1">nearly unprecedented.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your Majesty is too kind.” Sadeq wraps the cradle arms around himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">and faces her. “Your labors have been fruitful, I trust.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She shrugs. “I sell the biggest commodity in short supply on any</p>

<p class="softbreak"> </p>

<p class="calibre1">“My apologies, I mean no insult. I merely believe that, while you say</p>
<p class="calibre1">your goal is to provide the rule of law, what you sell is and must be</p>
<p class="calibre1">something different. Justice without God, sold to the highest bidder,</p>
<p class="calibre1">is not justice.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The queen nods. “Leaving aside the mention of God, I agree - I can’t</p>

<p class="calibre1">arguments take seconds or minutes. As long as everybody agrees to</p>
<p class="calibre1">abide by my arbitration, physical enforcement can wait until they’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">close enough to touch. And everybody does agree that my legal</p>
<p class="calibre1">framework is easier to comply with, better adjusted to trans-Jovian</p>
<p class="calibre1">space, than any earthbound one.” A note of steel creeps into her</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice, challenging: Her halo brightens, tickling a reactive glow from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the walls of the throne room.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five billion inputs or more, Sadeq marvels. The crown is an</p>
<p class="calibre1">engineering marvel, even though most of its mass is buried in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">walls and floor of this huge construct. “There is law revealed by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Prophet, peace be unto him, and there is law that we can establish by</p>
<p class="calibre1">analysing his intentions. There are other forms of law by which humans</p>
<p class="calibre1">live, and various interpretations of the law of God even among those</p>
<p class="calibre1">who study His works. How, in the absence of the word of the Prophet,</p>
<p class="calibre1">can you provide a moral compass?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm.” She taps her fingers on the arm of her throne, and Sadeq’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart freezes. He’s heard the stories from the claim jumpers and</p>
<p class="calibre1">boardroom bandits, from the greenmail experts with their roots in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">earthbound jurisdictions that have made such a hash of arbitration</p>
<p class="calibre1">here. How she can experience a year in a minute, rip your memories out</p>
<p class="calibre1">through your cortical implants, and make you relive your worst</p>
<p class="calibre1">mistakes in her nightmarishly powerful simulation space. She is the</p>
<p class="calibre1">queen - the first individual to get her hands on so much mass and</p>
<p class="calibre1">energy that she could pull ahead of the curve of binding technology,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the first to set up her own jurisdiction and rule certain</p>
<p class="calibre1">experiments to be legal so that she could make use of the mass/energy</p>
<p class="calibre1">intersection. She has force majeure - even the Pentagon’s infowarriors</p>
<p class="calibre1">respect the Ring Imperium’s autonomy for now. In fact, the body</p>
<p class="calibre1">sitting in the throne opposite him probably contains only a fraction</p>
<p class="calibre1">of her identity. She’s by no means the first upload or partial, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">she’s the first gust front of the storm of power that will arrive when</p>
<p class="calibre1">the arrogant ones achieve their goal of dismantling the planets and</p>
<p class="calibre1">turning dumb and uninhabited mass into brainpower throughout the</p>
<p class="calibre1">observable reaches of the universe. And he’s just questioned the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rectitude of her vision, in her presence.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The queen’s lips twitch. Then they curl into a wide, carnivorous grin.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind her, the cat sits up and stretches, then stares at Sadeq</p>
<p class="calibre1">through narrowed eyes.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know, that’s the first time in weeks that anyone has told me I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">full of shit. You haven’t been talking to my mother again, have you?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s Sadeq’s turn to shrug, uncomfortably. “I have prepared a</p>
<p class="calibre1">judgment,” he says slowly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah.” Amber rotates the huge diamond ring around her finger. Then she</p>
<p class="calibre1">looks him in the eye, a trifle nervously. Although what he could</p>
<p class="calibre1">possibly do to make her comply with any decree -</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To summarize: Her motive is polluted,” Sadeq says shortly.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does that mean what I think it does?” she asks.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sadeq breathes deeply again: “Yes, I think so.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her smile returns. “And is that the end of it?” she asks.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He raises a dark eyebrow: “Only if you can prove to me that you can</p>
<p class="calibre1">have a conscience in the absence of divine revelation.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her reaction catches him by surprise. “Oh, sure. That’s the next part</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the program. Obtaining divine revelations.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What! From the alien?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat, claws extended, delicately picks its way down to her lap and</p>
<p class="calibre1">waits to be held and stroked. It never once takes its eyes off him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where else?” she asks. “Doctor, I didn’t get the Franklin Trust to</p>
<p class="calibre1">loan me the wherewithal to build this castle just in return for some</p>
<p class="calibre1">legal paperwork, and some, ah, interesting legal waivers from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Brussels. We’ve known for years there’s a whole alien packet-switching</p>
<p class="calibre1">network out there, and we’re just getting spillover from some of their</p>
<p class="calibre1">routers. It turns out there’s a node not far away from here, in real</p>
<p class="calibre1">space. Helium-three, separate jurisdictions, heavy industrialization</p>
<p class="calibre1">on Io - there is a purpose to all this activity.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sadeq licks his suddenly dry lips. “You’re going to narrowcast a</p>
<p class="calibre1">reply?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, much better than that: we’re going to visit them. Cut the delay</p>
<p class="calibre1">cycle down to realtime. We came here to build a ship and recruit a</p>
<p class="calibre1">crew, even if we have to cannibalize the whole of Jupiter system to</p>
<p class="calibre1">pay for the exercise.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat yawns then fixes him with a thousand-yard stare. “This stupid</p>
<p class="calibre1">girl wants to bring her conscience along to a meeting with something</p>
<p class="calibre1">so smart it might as well be a god,” it says. “And she needs to</p>
<p class="calibre1">convince the peanut gallery back home that she’s got one, being a</p>
<p class="calibre1">born-again atheist and all. Which means, you’re it, monkey boy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s a slot open for the post of ship’s theologian on the first</p>
<p class="calibre1">starship out of Jupiter system. I don’t suppose I can convince you to</p>
<p class="calibre1">turn the offer down?”</p>
