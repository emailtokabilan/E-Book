<h2 id="calibre_toc_6" class="calibre3">Chapter 1: Lobsters</h2><p class="calibre1">Manfred’s on the road again, making strangers rich.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s a hot summer Tuesday, and he’s standing in the plaza in front of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Centraal Station with his eyeballs powered up and the sunlight</p>
<p class="calibre1">jangling off the canal, motor scooters and kamikaze cyclists whizzing</p>
<p class="calibre1">past and tourists chattering on every side. The square smells of water</p>
<p class="calibre1">and dirt and hot metal and the fart-laden exhaust fumes of cold</p>
<p class="calibre1">catalytic converters; the bells of trams ding in the background, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">birds flock overhead. He glances up and grabs a pigeon, crops the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shot, and squirts it at his weblog to show he’s arrived. The bandwidth</p>
<p class="calibre1">is good here, he realizes; and it’s not just the bandwidth, it’s the</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole scene. Amsterdam is making him feel wanted already, even though</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’s fresh off the train from Schiphol: He’s infected with the dynamic</p>
<p class="calibre1">optimism of another time zone, another city. If the mood holds,</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone out there is going to become very rich indeed.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He wonders who it’s going to be.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred sits on a stool out in the car park at the Brouwerij ‘t IJ,</p>
<p class="calibre1">watching the articulated buses go by and drinking a third of a liter</p>
<p class="calibre1">of lip-curlingly sour gueuze. His channels are jabbering away in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">corner of his head-up display, throwing compressed infobursts of</p>
<p class="calibre1">filtered press releases at him. They compete for his attention,</p>
<p class="calibre1">bickering and rudely waving in front of the scenery. A couple of punks</p>
<p class="calibre1">- maybe local, but more likely drifters lured to Amsterdam by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">magnetic field of tolerance the Dutch beam across Europe like a pulsar</p>
<p class="calibre1">- are laughing and chatting by a couple of battered mopeds in the far</p>
<p class="calibre1">corner. A tourist boat putters by in the canal; the sails of the huge</p>
<p class="calibre1">windmill overhead cast long, cool shadows across the road. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">windmill is a machine for lifting water, turning wind power into dry</p>
<p class="calibre1">land: trading energy for space, sixteenth-century style. Manfred is</p>
<p class="calibre1">waiting for an invite to a party where he’s going to meet a man he can</p>
<p class="calibre1">talk to about trading energy for space, twenty-first-century style,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and forget about his personal problems.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s ignoring the instant messenger boxes, enjoying some</p>
<p class="calibre1">low-bandwidth, high-sensation time with his beer and the pigeons, when</p>
<p class="calibre1">a woman walks up to him, and says his name: “Manfred Macx?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He glances up. The courier is an Effective Cyclist, all wind-burned</p>
<p class="calibre1">smooth-running muscles clad in a paean to polymer technology: electric</p>
<p class="calibre1">blue lycra and wasp yellow carbonate with a light speckling of anti</p>
<p class="calibre1">collision LEDs and tight-packed air bags. She holds out a box for him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He pauses a moment, struck by the degree to which she resembles Pam,</p>
<p class="calibre1">his ex-fiance.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m Macx,” he says, waving the back of his left wrist under her</p>
<p class="calibre1">bar-code reader. “Who’s it from?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“FedEx.” The voice isn’t Pam’s. She dumps the box in his lap, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">she’s back over the low wall and onto her bicycle with her phone</p>
<p class="calibre1">already chirping, disappearing in a cloud of spread-spectrum</p>
<p class="calibre1">emissions.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred turns the box over in his hands: it’s a disposable supermarket</p>
<p class="calibre1">phone, paid for in cash - cheap, untraceable, and efficient. It can</p>
<p class="calibre1">even do conference calls, which makes it the tool of choice for spooks</p>
<p class="calibre1">and grifters everywhere.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The box rings. Manfred rips the cover open and pulls out the phone,</p>
<p class="calibre1">mildly annoyed. “Yes? Who is this?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The voice at the other end has a heavy Russian accent, almost a parody</p>
<p class="calibre1">in this decade of cheap on-line translation services. “Manfred. Am</p>
<p class="calibre1">please to meet you. Wish to personalize interface, make friends, no?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Have much to offer.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who are you?” Manfred repeats suspiciously.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Am organization formerly known as KGB dot RU.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think your translator’s broken.” He holds the phone to his ear</p>
<p class="calibre1">carefully, as if it’s made of smoke-thin aerogel, tenuous as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sanity of the being on the other end of the line.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nyet - no, sorry. Am apologize for we not use commercial translation</p>
<p class="calibre1">software. Interpreters are ideologically suspect, mostly have</p>
<p class="calibre1">capitalist semiotics and pay-per-use APIs. Must implement English more</p>
<p class="calibre1">better, yes?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred drains his beer glass, sets it down, stands up, and begins to</p>
<p class="calibre1">walk along the main road, phone glued to the side of his head. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">wraps his throat mike around the cheap black plastic casing, pipes the</p>
<p class="calibre1">input to a simple listener process. “Are you saying you taught</p>
<p class="calibre1">yourself the language just so you could talk to me?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Da, was easy: Spawn billion-node neural network, and download</p>
<p class="calibre1">Teletubbies and Sesame Street at maximum speed. Pardon excuse entropy</p>
<p class="calibre1">overlay of bad grammar: Am afraid of digital fingerprints</p>
<p class="calibre1">steganographically masked into my-our tutorials.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred pauses in mid stride, narrowly avoids being mown down by a</p>
<p class="calibre1">GPS-guided roller blader. This is getting weird enough to trip his</p>
<p class="calibre1">weird-out meter, and that takes some doing. Manfred’s whole life is</p>
<p class="calibre1">lived on the bleeding edge of strangeness, fifteen minutes into</p>
<p class="calibre1">everyone else’s future, and he’s normally in complete control - but at</p>
<p class="calibre1">times like this he gets a frisson of fear, a sense that he might just</p>
<p class="calibre1">have missed the correct turn on reality’s approach road. “Uh, I’m not</p>
<p class="calibre1">sure I got that. Let me get this straight, you claim to be some kind</p>
<p class="calibre1">of AI, working for KGB dot RU, and you’re afraid of a copyright</p>
<p class="calibre1">infringement lawsuit over your translator semiotics?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Am have been badly burned by viral end-user license agreements. Have</p>
<p class="calibre1">no desire to experiment with patent shell companies held by Chechen</p>
<p class="calibre1">infoterrorists. You are human, you must not worry cereal company</p>
<p class="calibre1">repossess your small intestine because digest unlicensed food with it,</p>
<p class="calibre1">right? Manfred, you must help me-we. Am wishing to defect.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred stops dead in the street. “Oh man, you’ve got the wrong free</p>
<p class="calibre1">enterprise broker here. I don’t work for the government. I’m strictly</p>
<p class="calibre1">private.” A rogue advertisement sneaks through his junkbuster proxy</p>
<p class="calibre1">and spams glowing fifties kitsch across his navigation window - which</p>
<p class="calibre1">is blinking - for a moment before a phage process kills it and spawns</p>
<p class="calibre1">a new filter. He leans against a shop front, massaging his forehead</p>
<p class="calibre1">and eyeballing a display of antique brass doorknockers. “Have you</p>
<p class="calibre1">tried the State Department?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why bother? State Department am enemy of Novy-SSR. State Department</p>
<p class="calibre1">is not help us.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is getting just too bizarre. Manfred’s never been too clear on</p>
<p class="calibre1">new-old old-new European metapolitics: Just dodging the crumbling</p>
<p class="calibre1">bureaucracy of his old-old American heritage gives him headaches.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, if you hadn’t shafted them during the late noughties … “</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred taps his left heel on the pavement, looking round for a way</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of this conversation. A camera winks at him from atop a</p>
<p class="calibre1">streetlight; he waves, wondering idly if it’s the KGB or the traffic</p>
<p class="calibre1">police. He is waiting for directions to the party, which should arrive</p>
<p class="calibre1">within the next half hour, and this Cold War retread Eliza-bot is</p>
<p class="calibre1">bumming him out. “Look, I don’t deal with the G-men. I hate the</p>
<p class="calibre1">military-industrial complex. I hate traditional politics. They’re all</p>
<p class="calibre1">zero-sum cannibals.” A thought occurs to him. “If survival is what</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re after, you could post your state vector on one of the p2p nets:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then nobody could delete you -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nyet!” The artificial intelligence sounds as alarmed as it’s possible</p>
<p class="calibre1">to sound over a VoiP link. “Am not open source! Not want lose</p>
<p class="calibre1">autonomy!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then we probably have nothing to talk about.” Manfred punches the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hang-up button and throws the mobile phone out into a canal. It hits</p>
<p class="calibre1">the water, and there’s a pop of deflagrating lithium cells. “Fucking</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cold War hangover losers,” he swears under his breath, quite angry,</p>
<p class="calibre1">partly at himself for losing his cool and partly at the harassing</p>
<p class="calibre1">entity behind the anonymous phone call. “Fucking capitalist spooks.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Russia has been back under the thumb of the apparatchiks for fifteen</p>
<p class="calibre1">years now, its brief flirtation with anarchocapitalism replaced by</p>
<p class="calibre1">Brezhnevite dirigisme and Putinesque puritanism, and it’s no surprise</p>
<p class="calibre1">that the wall’s crumbling - but it looks like they haven’t learned</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything from the current woes afflicting the United States. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">neocommies still think in terms of dollars and paranoia. Manfred is so</p>
<p class="calibre1">angry that he wants to make someone rich, just to thumb his nose at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the would-be defector: See! You get ahead by giving! Get with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">program! Only the generous survive! But the KGB won’t get the message.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s dealt with old-time commie weak-AIs before, minds raised on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Marxist dialectic and Austrian School economics: They’re so thoroughly</p>
<p class="calibre1">hypnotized by the short-term victory of global capitalism that they</p>
<p class="calibre1">can’t surf the new paradigm, look to the longer term.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred walks on, hands in pockets, brooding. He wonders what he’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">going to patent next.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred has a suite at the Hotel Jan Luyken paid for by a grateful</p>
<p class="calibre1">multinational consumer protection group, and an unlimited public</p>
<p class="calibre1">transport pass paid for by a Scottish sambapunk band in return for</p>
<p class="calibre1">services rendered. He has airline employee’s travel rights with six</p>
<p class="calibre1">flag carriers despite never having worked for an airline. His bush</p>
<p class="calibre1">jacket has sixty-four compact supercomputing clusters sewn into it,</p>
<p class="calibre1">four per pocket, courtesy of an invisible college that wants to</p>
<p class="calibre1">grow up to be the next Media Lab. His dumb clothing comes made to</p>
<p class="calibre1">measure from an e-tailor in the Philippines he’s never met. Law</p>
<p class="calibre1">firms handle his patent applications on a pro bono basis, and boy,</p>
<p class="calibre1">does he patent a lot - although he always signs the rights over to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Free Intellect Foundation, as contributions to their</p>
<p class="calibre1">obligation-free infrastructure project.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">In IP geek circles, Manfred is legendary; he’s the guy who patented</p>
<p class="calibre1">the business practice of moving your ebusiness somewhere with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">slack intellectual property regime in order to evade licensing</p>
<p class="calibre1">encumbrances. He’s the guy who patented using genetic algorithms to</p>
<p class="calibre1">patent everything they can permutate from an initial description of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a problem domain - not just a better mousetrap, but the set of all</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible better mousetraps. Roughly a third of his inventions are</p>
<p class="calibre1">legal, a third are illegal, and the remainder are legal but will</p>
<p class="calibre1">become illegal as soon as the legislatosaurus wakes up, smells the</p>
<p class="calibre1">coffee, and panics. There are patent attorneys in Reno who swear</p>
<p class="calibre1">that Manfred Macx is a pseudo, a net alias fronting for a bunch of</p>
<p class="calibre1">crazed anonymous hackers armed with the Genetic Algorithm That Ate</p>
<p class="calibre1">Calcutta: a kind of Serdar Argic of intellectual property, or maybe</p>
<p class="calibre1">another Bourbaki math borg. There are lawyers in San Diego and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Redmond who swear blind that Macx is an economic saboteur bent on</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrecking the underpinning of capitalism, and there are communists</p>
<p class="calibre1">in Prague who think he’s the bastard spawn of Bill Gates by way of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Pope.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred is at the peak of his profession, which is essentially</p>
<p class="calibre1">coming up with whacky but workable ideas and giving them to people</p>
<p class="calibre1">who will make fortunes with them. He does this for free, gratis. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">return, he has virtual immunity from the tyranny of cash; money is</p>
<p class="calibre1">a symptom of poverty, after all, and Manfred never has to pay for</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are drawbacks, however. Being a pronoiac meme-broker is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">constant burn of future shock - he has to assimilate more than a</p>
<p class="calibre1">megabyte of text and several gigs of AV content every day just to</p>
<p class="calibre1">stay current. The Internal Revenue Service is investigating him</p>
<p class="calibre1">continuously because it doesn’t believe his lifestyle can exist</p>
<p class="calibre1">without racketeering. And then there are the items that no money</p>
<p class="calibre1">can’t buy: like the respect of his parents. He hasn’t spoken to</p>
<p class="calibre1">them for three years, his father thinks he’s a hippy scrounger, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">his mother still hasn’t forgiven him for dropping out of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">downmarket Harvard emulation course. (They’re still locked in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">boringly bourgeois twen-cen paradigm of college-career-kids.) His</p>
<p class="calibre1">fiance and sometime dominatrix Pamela threw him over six months</p>
<p class="calibre1">ago, for reasons he has never been quite clear on. (Ironically,</p>
<p class="calibre1">she’s a headhunter for the IRS, jetting all over the place at</p>
<p class="calibre1">public expense, trying to persuade entrepreneurs who’ve gone global</p>
<p class="calibre1">to pay taxes for the good of the Treasury Department.) To cap it</p>
<p class="calibre1">all, the Southern Baptist Conventions have denounced him as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">minion of Satan on all their websites. Which would be funny</p>
<p class="calibre1">because, as a born-again atheist Manfred doesn’t believe in Satan,</p>
<p class="calibre1">if it wasn’t for the dead kittens that someone keeps mailing him.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred drops in at his hotel suite, unpacks his Aineko, plugs in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fresh set of cells to charge, and sticks most of his private keys in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the safe. Then he heads straight for the party, which is currently</p>
<p class="calibre1">happening at De Wildemann’s; it’s a twenty-minute walk, and the only</p>
<p class="calibre1">real hazard is dodging the trams that sneak up on him behind the cover</p>
<p class="calibre1">of his moving map display.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Along the way, his glasses bring him up to date on the news. Europe</p>
<p class="calibre1">has achieved peaceful political union for the first time ever: They’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">using this unprecedented state of affairs to harmonize the curvature</p>
<p class="calibre1">of bananas. The Middle East is, well, it’s just as bad as ever, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">the war on fundamentalism doesn’t hold much interest for Manfred. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">San Diego, researchers are uploading lobsters into cyberspace,</p>
<p class="calibre1">starting with the stomatogastric ganglion, one neuron at a time.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They’re burning GM cocoa in Belize and books in Georgia. NASA still</p>
<p class="calibre1">can’t put a man on the moon. Russia has reelected the communist</p>
<p class="calibre1">government with an increased majority in the Duma; meanwhile, in</p>
<p class="calibre1">China, fevered rumors circulate about an imminent rehabilitation, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">second coming of Mao, who will save them from the consequences of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Three Gorges disaster. In business news, the US Justice Department is</p>
<p class="calibre1">- ironically - outraged at the Baby Bills. The divested Microsoft</p>
<p class="calibre1">divisions have automated their legal processes and are spawning</p>
<p class="calibre1">subsidiaries, IPOing them, and exchanging title in a bizarre parody of</p>
<p class="calibre1">bacterial plasmid exchange, so fast that, by the time the windfall tax</p>
<p class="calibre1">demands are served, the targets don’t exist anymore, even though the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same staff are working on the same software in the same Mumbai cubicle</p>
<p class="calibre1">farms.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Welcome to the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The permanent floating meatspace party Manfred is hooking up with is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">strange attractor for some of the American exiles cluttering up the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cities of Europe this decade - not trustafarians, but honest-to-God</p>
<p class="calibre1">political dissidents, draft dodgers, and terminal outsourcing victims.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s the kind of place where weird connections are made and crossed</p>
<p class="calibre1">lines make new short circuits into the future, like the street cafes</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Switzerland where the pre Great War Russian exiles gathered. Right</p>
<p class="calibre1">now it’s located in the back of De Wildemann’s, a three-hundred-year</p>
<p class="calibre1">old brown cafe with a list of brews that runs to sixteen pages and</p>
<p class="calibre1">wooden walls stained the color of stale beer. The air is thick with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the smells of tobacco, brewer’s yeast, and melatonin spray: Half the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dotters are nursing monster jet lag hangovers, and the other half are</p>
<p class="calibre1">babbling a Eurotrash creole at each other while they work on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hangover. “Man did you see that? He looks like a Democrat!” exclaims</p>
<p class="calibre1">one whitebread hanger-on who’s currently propping up the bar. Manfred</p>
<p class="calibre1">slides in next to him, catches the bartender’s eye.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Glass of the Berlinerweisse, please,” he says.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You drink that stuff?” asks the hanger-on, curling a hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">protectively around his Coke. “Man, you don’t want to do that! It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">full of alcohol!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred grins at him toothily. “Ya gotta keep your yeast intake up:</p>
<p class="calibre1">There are lots of neurotransmitter precursors in this shit,</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenylalanine and glutamate.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I thought that was a beer you were ordering …”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred’s away, one hand resting on the smooth brass pipe that funnels</p>
<p class="calibre1">the more popular draught items in from the cask storage in back; one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the hipper floaters has planted a contact bug on it, and the vCards</p>
<p class="calibre1">of all the personal network owners who’ve have visited the bar in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">past three hours are queuing up for attention. The air is full of</p>
<p class="calibre1">ultrawideband chatter, WiMAX and ‘tooth both, as he speed-scrolls</p>
<p class="calibre1">through the dizzying list of cached keys in search of one particular</p>
<p class="calibre1">name.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your drink.” The barman holds out an improbable-looking goblet full</p>
<p class="calibre1">of blue liquid with a cap of melting foam and a felching straw stuck</p>
<p class="calibre1">out at some crazy angle. Manfred takes it and heads for the back of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the split-level bar, up the steps to a table where some guy with</p>
<p class="calibre1">greasy dreadlocks is talking to a suit from Paris. The hanger-on at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the bar notices him for the first time, staring with suddenly wide</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes: He nearly spills his Coke in a mad rush for the door.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh shit, thinks Manfred, better buy some more server time. He can</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognize the signs: He’s about to be slashdotted. He gestures at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">table. “This one taken?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be my guest,” says the guy with the dreads. Manfred slides the chair</p>
<p class="calibre1">open then realizes that the other guy - immaculate double-breasted</p>
<p class="calibre1">Suit, sober tie, crew cut - is a girl. She nods at him, half-smiling</p>
<p class="calibre1">at his transparent double take. Mr. Dreadlock nods. “You’re Macx? I</p>
<p class="calibre1">figured it was about time we met.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure.” Manfred holds out a hand, and they shake. His PDA discreetly</p>
<p class="calibre1">swaps digital fingerprints, confirming that the hand belongs to Bob</p>
<p class="calibre1">Franklin, a Research Triangle startup monkey with a VC track record,</p>
<p class="calibre1">lately moving into micromachining and space technology. Franklin made</p>
<p class="calibre1">his first million two decades ago, and now he’s a specialist in</p>
<p class="calibre1">extropian investment fields. Operating exclusively overseas these past</p>
<p class="calibre1">five years, ever since the IRS got medieval about trying to suture the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sucking chest wound of the federal budget deficit. Manfred has known</p>
<p class="calibre1">him for nearly a decade via a closed mailing list, but this is the</p>
<p class="calibre1">first time they’ve ever met face-to-face. The Suit silently slides a</p>
<p class="calibre1">business card across the table; a little red devil brandishes a</p>
<p class="calibre1">trident at him, flames jetting up around its feet. He takes the card,</p>
<p class="calibre1">raises an eyebrow: “Annette Dimarcos? I’m pleased to meet you. Can’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">say I’ve ever met anyone from Arianespace marketing before.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She smiles warmly; “That is all right. I have not the pleasure of</p>
<p class="calibre1">meeting the famous venture altruist either.” Her accent is noticeably</p>
<p class="calibre1">Parisian, a pointed reminder that she’s making a concession to him</p>
<p class="calibre1">just by talking. Her camera earrings watch him curiously, encoding</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything for the company memory. She’s a genuine new European,</p>
<p class="calibre1">unlike most of the American exiles cluttering up the bar.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, well.” He nods cautiously, unsure how to deal with her. “Bob. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">assume you’re in on this ball?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Franklin nods; beads clatter. “Yeah, man. Ever since the Teledesic</p>
<p class="calibre1">smash it’s been, well, waiting. If you’ve got something for us, we’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">game.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm.” The Teledesic satellite cluster was killed by cheap balloons</p>
<p class="calibre1">and slightly less cheap high-altitude, solar-powered drones with</p>
<p class="calibre1">spread-spectrum laser relays: It marked the beginning of a serious</p>
<p class="calibre1">recession in the satellite biz. “The depression’s got to end sometime:</p>
<p class="calibre1">But” - a nod to Annette from Paris - “with all due respect, I don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">think the break will involve one of the existing club carriers.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She shrugs. “Arianespace is forward-looking. We face reality. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">launch cartel cannot stand. Bandwidth is not the only market force in</p>
<p class="calibre1">space. We must explore new opportunities. I personally have helped us</p>
<p class="calibre1">diversify into submarine reactor engineering, microgravity</p>
<p class="calibre1">nanotechnology fabrication, and hotel management.” Her face is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">well-polished mask as she recites the company line, but he can sense</p>
<p class="calibre1">the sardonic amusement behind it as she adds: “We are more flexible</p>
<p class="calibre1">than the American space industry …”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred shrugs. “That’s as may be.” He sips his Berlinerweisse slowly</p>
<p class="calibre1">as she launches into a long, stilted explanation of how Arianespace is</p>
<p class="calibre1">a diversified dot-com with orbital aspirations, a full range of</p>
<p class="calibre1">merchandising spin-offs, Bond movie sets, and a promising hotel chain</p>
<p class="calibre1">in LEO. She obviously didn’t come up with these talking points</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself. Her face is much more expressive than her voice as she mimes</p>
<p class="calibre1">boredom and disbelief at appropriate moments - an out-of-band signal</p>
<p class="calibre1">invisible to her corporate earrings. Manfred plays along, nodding</p>
<p class="calibre1">occasionally, trying to look as if he’s taking it seriously: Her droll</p>
<p class="calibre1">subversion has got his attention far more effectively than the content</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the marketing pitch. Franklin is nose down in his beer, shoulders</p>
<p class="calibre1">shaking as he tries not to guffaw at the hand gestures she uses to</p>
<p class="calibre1">express her opinion of her employer’s thrusting, entrepreneurial</p>
<p class="calibre1">executives. Actually, the talking points bullshit is right about one</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing: Arianespace is still profitable, due to those hotels and</p>
<p class="calibre1">orbital holiday hops. Unlike LockMartBoeing, who’d go Chapter Eleven</p>
<p class="calibre1">in a split second if their Pentagon drip-feed ran dry.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone else sidles up to the table; a pudgy guy in outrageously loud</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawaiian shirt with pens leaking in a breast pocket and the worst case</p>
<p class="calibre1">of ozone-hole burn Manfred’s seen in ages. “Hi, Bob,” says the new</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrival. “How’s life?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘S good.” Franklin nodes at Manfred; “Manfred, meet Ivan MacDonald.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ivan, Manfred. Have a seat?” He leans over. “Ivan’s a public arts guy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s heavily into extreme concrete.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rubberized concrete,” Ivan says, slightly too loudly. “Pink</p>
<p class="calibre1">rubberized concrete.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah!” He’s somehow triggered a priority interrupt: Annette from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Arianespace drops out of marketing zombiehood with a shudder of relief</p>
<p class="calibre1">and, duty discharged, reverts to her non corporate identity: “You are</p>
<p class="calibre1">he who rubberized the Reichstag, yes? With the supercritical</p>
<p class="calibre1">carbon-dioxide carrier and the dissolved polymethoxysilanes?” She</p>
<p class="calibre1">claps her hands, eyes alight with enthusiasm: “Wonderful!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He rubberized what?” Manfred mutters in Bob’s ear.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Franklin shrugs. “Don’t ask me, I’m just an engineer.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He works with limestone and sandstones as well as concrete; he’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">brilliant!” Annette smiles at Manfred. “Rubberizing the symbol of the,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the autocracy, is it not wonderful?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought I was thirty seconds ahead of the curve,” Manfred says</p>
<p class="calibre1">ruefully. He adds to Bob: “Buy me another drink?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m going to rubberize Three Gorges!” Ivan explains loudly. “When the</p>
<p class="calibre1">floodwaters subside.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just then, a bandwidth load as heavy as a pregnant elephant sits down</p>
<p class="calibre1">on Manfred’s head and sends clumps of humongous pixilation flickering</p>
<p class="calibre1">across his sensorium: Around the world, five million or so geeks are</p>
<p class="calibre1">bouncing on his home site, a digital flash crowd alerted by a posting</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the other side of the bar. Manfred winces. “I really came here to</p>
<p class="calibre1">talk about the economic exploitation of space travel, but I’ve just</p>
<p class="calibre1">been slashdotted. Mind if I just sit and drink until it wears off?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure, man.” Bob waves at the bar. “More of the same all round!” At</p>
<p class="calibre1">the next table, a person with makeup and long hair who’s wearing a</p>
<p class="calibre1">dress - Manfred doesn’t want to speculate about the gender of these</p>
<p class="calibre1">crazy mixed-up Euros - is reminiscing about wiring the fleshpots of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tehran for cybersex. Two collegiate-looking dudes are arguing</p>
<p class="calibre1">intensely in German: The translation stream in his glasses tell him</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’re arguing over whether the Turing Test is a Jim Crow law that</p>
<p class="calibre1">violates European corpus juris standards on human rights. The beer</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrives, and Bob slides the wrong one across to Manfred: “Here, try</p>
<p class="calibre1">this. You’ll like it.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.” It’s some kind of smoked doppelbock, chock-full of yummy</p>
<p class="calibre1">superoxides: Just inhaling over it makes Manfred feel like there’s a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fire alarm in his nose screaming danger, Will Robinson! Cancer!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cancer!. “Yeah, right. Did I say I nearly got mugged on my way here?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mugged? Hey, that’s heavy. I thought the police hereabouts had</p>
<p class="calibre1">stopped - did they sell you anything?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, but they weren’t your usual marketing type. You know anyone who</p>
<p class="calibre1">can use a Warpac surplus espionage bot? Recent model, one careful</p>
<p class="calibre1">owner, slightly paranoid but basically sound - I mean, claims to be a</p>
<p class="calibre1">general-purpose AI?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No. Oh boy! The NSA wouldn’t like that.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What I thought. Poor thing’s probably unemployable, anyway.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The space biz.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, yeah. The space biz. Depressing, isn’t it? Hasn’t been the same</p>
<p class="calibre1">since Rotary Rocket went bust for the second time. And NASA, mustn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">forget NASA.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To NASA.” Annette grins broadly for her own reasons, raises a glass</p>
<p class="calibre1">in toast. Ivan the extreme concrete geek has an arm round her</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulders, and she leans against him; he raises his glass, too. “Lots</p>
<p class="calibre1">more launchpads to rubberize!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To NASA,” Bob echoes. They drink. “Hey, Manfred. To NASA?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“NASA are idiots. They want to send canned primates to Mars!” Manfred</p>
<p class="calibre1">swallows a mouthful of beer, aggressively plonks his glass on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">table: “Mars is just dumb mass at the bottom of a gravity well; there</p>
<p class="calibre1">isn’t even a biosphere there. They should be working on uploading and</p>
<p class="calibre1">solving the nanoassembly conformational problem instead. Then we could</p>
<p class="calibre1">turn all the available dumb matter into computronium and use it for</p>
<p class="calibre1">processing our thoughts. Long-term, it’s the only way to go. The solar</p>
<p class="calibre1">system is a dead loss right now - dumb all over! Just measure the MIPS</p>
<p class="calibre1">per milligram. If it isn’t thinking, it isn’t working. We need to</p>
<p class="calibre1">start with the low-mass bodies, reconfigure them for our own use.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dismantle the moon! Dismantle Mars! Build masses of free-flying</p>
<p class="calibre1">nanocomputing processor nodes exchanging data via laser link, each</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette is watching him with interest, but Bob looks wary. “Sounds</p>
<p class="calibre1">kind of long-term to me. Just how far ahead do you think?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very long-term - at least twenty, thirty years. And you can forget</p>
<p class="calibre1">governments for this market, Bob; if they can’t tax it, they won’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand it. But see, there’s an angle on the self-replicating</p>
<p class="calibre1">robotics market coming up, that’s going to set the cheap launch market</p>
<p class="calibre1">doubling every fifteen months for the foreseeable future, starting in,</p>
<p class="calibre1">oh, about two years. It’s your leg up, and my keystone for the Dyson</p>

<p class="calibre1">It’s night in Amsterdam, morning in Silicon Valley. Today, fifty</p>

<p class="calibre1">automated factories in Indonesia and Mexico have produced another</p>
<p class="calibre1">quarter of a million motherboards with processors rated at more than</p>
<p class="calibre1">ten petaflops - about an order of magnitude below the lower bound on</p>

<p class="calibre1">Manfred stumbles back to his hotel, bone-weary and jet-lagged; his</p>
<p class="calibre1">glasses are still jerking, slashdotted to hell and back by geeks</p>
<p class="calibre1">piggybacking on his call to dismantle the moon. They stutter quiet</p>
<p class="calibre1">suggestions at his peripheral vision. Fractal cloud-witches ghost</p>
<p class="calibre1">across the face of the moon as the last huge Airbuses of the night</p>
<p class="calibre1">rumble past overhead. Manfred’s skin crawls, grime embedded in his</p>
<p class="calibre1">clothing from three days of continuous wear.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back in his room, the Aineko mewls for attention and strops her head</p>
<p class="calibre1">against his ankle. She’s a late-model Sony, thoroughly upgradeable:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred’s been working on her in his spare minutes, using an open</p>
<p class="calibre1">source development kit to extend her suite of neural networks. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">bends down and pets her, then sheds his clothing and heads for the en</p>
<p class="calibre1">suite bathroom. When he’s down to the glasses and nothing more, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">steps into the shower and dials up a hot, steamy spray. The shower</p>
<p class="calibre1">tries to strike up a friendly conversation about football, but he</p>
<p class="calibre1">isn’t even awake enough to mess with its silly little associative</p>
<p class="calibre1">personalization network. Something that happened earlier in the day is</p>
<p class="calibre1">bugging him, but he can’t quite put his finger on what’s wrong.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Toweling himself off, Manfred yawns. Jet lag has finally overtaken</p>
<p class="calibre1">him, a velvet hammerblow between the eyes. He reaches for the bottle</p>
<p class="calibre1">beside the bed, dry-swallows two melatonin tablets, a capsule full of</p>
<p class="calibre1">antioxidants, and a multivitamin bullet: Then he lies down on the bed,</p>
<p class="calibre1">on his back, legs together, arms slightly spread. The suite lights dim</p>
<p class="calibre1">in response to commands from the thousand petaflops of distributed</p>
<p class="calibre1">processing power running the neural networks that interface with his</p>
<p class="calibre1">meatbrain through the glasses.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred drops into a deep ocean of unconsciousness populated by gentle</p>
<p class="calibre1">voices. He isn’t aware of it, but he talks in his sleep - disjointed</p>
<p class="calibre1">mumblings that would mean little to another human but everything to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the metacortex lurking beyond his glasses. The young posthuman</p>
<p class="calibre1">intelligence over whose Cartesian theatre he presides sings urgently</p>

<p class="calibre1">Manfred is always at his most vulnerable shortly after waking.</p>

<p class="calibre1">He screams into wakefulness as artificial light floods the room: For a</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment he is unsure whether he has slept. He forgot to pull the covers</p>
<p class="calibre1">up last night, and his feet feel like lumps of frozen cardboard.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shuddering with inexplicable tension, he pulls a fresh set of</p>
<p class="calibre1">underwear from his overnight bag, then drags on soiled jeans and tank</p>
<p class="calibre1">top. Sometime today he’ll have to spare time to hunt the feral T-shirt</p>
<p class="calibre1">in Amsterdam’s markets, or find a Renfield and send it forth to buy</p>
<p class="calibre1">clothing. He really ought to find a gym and work out, but he doesn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">have time - his glasses remind him that he’s six hours behind the</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment and urgently needs to catch up. His teeth ache in his gums, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">his tongue feels like a forest floor that’s been visited with Agent</p>
<p class="calibre1">Orange. He has a sense that something went bad yesterday; if only he</p>

<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He speed reads a new pop-philosophy tome while he brushes his teeth,</p>

<p class="calibre1">still too enervated to finish his pre-breakfast routine by posting a</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning rant on his storyboard site. His brain is still fuzzy, like a</p>
<p class="calibre1">scalpel blade clogged with too much blood: He needs stimulus,</p>
<p class="calibre1">excitement, the burn of the new. Whatever, it can wait on breakfast.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He opens his bedroom door and nearly steps on a small, damp cardboard</p>
<p class="calibre1">box that lies on the carpet.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The box - he’s seen a couple of its kin before. But there are no</p>
<p class="calibre1">stamps on this one, no address: just his name, in big, childish</p>
<p class="calibre1">handwriting. He kneels and gently picks it up. It’s about the right</p>
<p class="calibre1">weight. Something shifts inside it when he tips it back and forth. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">smells. He carries it into his room carefully, angrily: Then he opens</p>
<p class="calibre1">it to confirm his worst suspicion. It’s been surgically decerebrated,</p>
<p class="calibre1">brains scooped out like a boiled egg.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fuck!”</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred pauses for a moment, triggering agents to go hunt down arrest</p>
<p class="calibre1">statistics, police relations, information on corpus juris, Dutch</p>
<p class="calibre1">animal-cruelty laws. He isn’t sure whether to dial two-one-one on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">archaic voice phone or let it ride. Aineko, picking up his angst,</p>
<p class="calibre1">hides under the dresser mewling pathetically. Normally he’d pause a</p>
<p class="calibre1">minute to reassure the creature, but not now: Its’ mere presence is</p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly acutely embarrassing, a confession of deep inadequacy. It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">too realistic, as if somehow the dead kitten’s neural maps — stolen,</p>
<p class="calibre1">no doubt, for some dubious uploading experiment — have ended up</p>
<p class="calibre1">padding out its plastic skull. He swears again, looks around, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">takes the easy option: Down the stairs two steps at a time, stumbling</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the second floor landing, down to the breakfast room in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">basement, where he will perform the stable rituals of morning.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Breakfast is unchanging, an island of deep geological time standing</p>
<p class="calibre1">still amidst the continental upheaval of new technologies. While</p>
<p class="calibre1">reading a paper on public key steganography and parasite network</p>
<p class="calibre1">identity spoofing he mechanically assimilates a bowl of cornflakes and</p>
<p class="calibre1">skimmed milk, then brings a platter of whole grain bread and slices of</p>
<p class="calibre1">some weird seed-infested Dutch cheese back to his place. There is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cup of strong black coffee in front of his setting, and he picks it up</p>
<p class="calibre1">and slurps half of it down before he realizes he’s not alone at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">table. Someone is sitting opposite him. He glances up incuriously and</p>
<p class="calibre1">freezes inside.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Morning, Manfred. How does it feel to owe the government twelve</p>
<p class="calibre1">million, three hundred and sixty-two thousand, nine hundred and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sixteen dollars and fifty-one cents?” She smiles a Mona Lisa smile, at</p>
<p class="calibre1">once affectionate and challenging.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred puts everything in his sensorium on indefinite hold and stares</p>
<p class="calibre1">at her. She’s immaculately turned out in a formal gray business suit:</p>
<p class="calibre1">brown hair tightly drawn back, blue eyes quizzical. And as beautiful</p>
<p class="calibre1">as ever: tall, ash blonde, with features that speak of an unexplored</p>
<p class="calibre1">modeling career. The chaperone badge clipped to her lapel - a due</p>
<p class="calibre1">diligence guarantee of businesslike conduct - is switched off. He’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">feeling ripped because of the dead kitten and residual jet lag, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">more than a little messy, so he snarls back at her; “That’s a bogus</p>
<p class="calibre1">estimate! Did they send you here because they think I’ll listen to</p>
<p class="calibre1">you?” He bites and swallows a slice of cheese-laden crispbread: “Or</p>
<p class="calibre1">did you decide to deliver the message in person just so you could ruin</p>
<p class="calibre1">my breakfast?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Manny.” She frowns, pained. “If you’re going to be confrontational, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">might as well go now.” She pauses, and after a moment he nods</p>
<p class="calibre1">apologetically. “I didn’t come all this way just because of an overdue</p>
<p class="calibre1">tax estimate.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So.” He puts his coffee cup down warily and thinks for a moment,</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying to conceal his unease and turmoil. “Then what brings you here?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Help yourself to coffee. Don’t tell me you came all this way just to</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell me you can’t live without me.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She fixes him with a riding-crop stare: “Don’t flatter yourself. There</p>
<p class="calibre1">are many leaves in the forest, there are ten thousand hopeful subs in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the chat room, et cetera. If I choose a man to contribute to my family</p>
<p class="calibre1">tree, the one thing you can be certain of is he won’t be a cheapskate</p>
<p class="calibre1">when it comes to providing for his children.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Last I heard, you were spending a lot of time with Brian,” he says</p>
<p class="calibre1">carefully. Brian: a name without a face. Too much money, too little</p>
<p class="calibre1">sense. Something to do with a blue-chip accountancy partnership.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Brian?” She snorts. “That ended ages ago. He turned weird on me -</p>

<p class="calibre1">mail.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s a lot of it about these days.” Manfred nods, almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">sympathetically, although an edgy little corner of his mind is</p>
<p class="calibre1">gloating. “Good riddance, then. I suppose this means you’re still</p>
<p class="calibre1">playing the scene? But looking around for the, er -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Traditional family thing? Yes. Your trouble, Manny? You were born</p>
<p class="calibre1">forty years too late: You still believe in rutting before marriage but</p>
<p class="calibre1">find the idea of coping with the after-effects disturbing.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred drinks the rest of his coffee, unable to reply effectively to</p>
<p class="calibre1">her non sequitur. It’s a generational thing. This generation is happy</p>
<p class="calibre1">with latex and leather, whips and butt plugs and electrostim, but find</p>
<p class="calibre1">the idea of exchanging bodily fluids shocking: a social side effect of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the last century’s antibiotic abuse. Despite being engaged for two</p>
<p class="calibre1">years, he and Pamela never had intromissive intercourse.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I just don’t feel positive about having children,” he says</p>
<p class="calibre1">eventually. “And I’m not planning on changing my mind anytime soon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Things are changing so fast that even a twenty-year commitment is too</p>
<p class="calibre1">far to plan - you might as well be talking about the next ice age. As</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the money thing, I am reproductively fit - just not within the</p>
<p class="calibre1">parameters of the outgoing paradigm. Would you be happy about the</p>
<p class="calibre1">future if it was 1901 and you’d just married a buggy-whip mogul?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her fingers twitch, and his ears flush red; but she doesn’t follow up</p>
<p class="calibre1">the double entendre. “You don’t feel any responsibility, do you? Not</p>
<p class="calibre1">to your country, not to me. That’s what this is about: None of your</p>
<p class="calibre1">relationships count, all this nonsense about giving intellectual</p>
<p class="calibre1">property away notwithstanding. You’re actively harming people you</p>
<p class="calibre1">know. That twelve mil isn’t just some figure I pulled out of a hat,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred; they don’t actually expect you to pay it. But it’s almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">exactly how much you’d owe in income tax if you’d only come home,</p>
<p class="calibre1">start up a corporation, and be a self-made -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t agree. You’re confusing two wholly different issues and</p>
<p class="calibre1">calling them both ‘responsibility.’ And I refuse to start charging</p>
<p class="calibre1">now, just to balance the IRS’s spreadsheet. It’s their fucking fault,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and they know it. If they hadn’t gone after me under suspicion of</p>
<p class="calibre1">running a massively ramified microbilling fraud when I was sixteen -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bygones.” She waves a hand dismissively. Her fingers are long and</p>
<p class="calibre1">slim, sheathed in black glossy gloves - electrically earthed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">prevent embarrassing emissions. “With a bit of the right advice we can</p>
<p class="calibre1">get all that set aside. You’ll have to stop bumming around the world</p>
<p class="calibre1">sooner or later, anyway. Grow up, get responsible, and do the right</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing. This is hurting Joe and Sue; they don’t understand what you’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">about.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred bites his tongue to stifle his first response, then refills</p>
<p class="calibre1">his coffee cup and takes another mouthful. His heart does a flip-flop:</p>
<p class="calibre1">She’s challenging him again, always trying to own him. “I work for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">betterment of everybody, not just some narrowly defined national</p>
<p class="calibre1">interest, Pam. It’s the agalmic future. You’re still locked into a</p>
<p class="calibre1">presingularity economic model that thinks in terms of scarcity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Resource allocation isn’t a problem anymore - it’s going to be over</p>
<p class="calibre1">within a decade. The cosmos is flat in all directions, and we can</p>
<p class="calibre1">borrow as much bandwidth as we need from the first universal bank of</p>
<p class="calibre1">entropy! They even found signs of smart matter - MACHOs, big brown</p>
<p class="calibre1">dwarfs in the galactic halo, leaking radiation in the long infrared -</p>
<p class="calibre1">suspiciously high entropy leakage. The latest figures say something</p>
<p class="calibre1">like seventy percent of the baryonic mass of the M31 galaxy was in</p>
<p class="calibre1">computronium, two-point-nine million years ago, when the photons we’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeing now set out. The intelligence gap between us and the aliens is</p>
<p class="calibre1">a probably about a trillion times bigger than the gap between us and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">nematode worm. Do you have any idea what that means?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pamela nibbles at a slice of crispbread, then graces him with a slow,</p>
<p class="calibre1">carnivorous stare. “I don’t care: It’s too far away to have any</p>
<p class="calibre1">influence on us, isn’t it? It doesn’t matter whether I believe in that</p>
<p class="calibre1">singularity you keep chasing, or your aliens a thousand light-years</p>
<p class="calibre1">away. It’s a chimera, like Y2K, and while you’re running after it, you</p>
<p class="calibre1">aren’t helping reduce the budget deficit or sire a family, and that’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">what I care about. And before you say I only care about it because</p>
<p class="calibre1">that’s the way I’m programmed, I want you to ask just how dumb you</p>
<p class="calibre1">think I am. Bayes’ Theorem says I’m right, and you know it.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What you -” He stops dead, baffled, the mad flow of his enthusiasm</p>
<p class="calibre1">running up against the coffer dam of her certainty. “Why? I mean, why?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Why on earth should what I do matter to you?” Since you canceled our</p>
<p class="calibre1">engagement, he doesn’t add.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She sighs. “Manny, the Internal Revenue cares about far more than you</p>
<p class="calibre1">can possibly imagine. Every tax dollar raised east of the Mississippi</p>
<p class="calibre1">goes on servicing the debt, did you know that? We’ve got the biggest</p>
<p class="calibre1">generation in history hitting retirement and the cupboard is bare. We</p>
<p class="calibre1">- our generation - isn’t producing enough skilled workers to replace</p>
<p class="calibre1">the taxpayer base, either, not since our parents screwed the public</p>
<p class="calibre1">education system and outsourced the white-collar jobs. In ten years,</p>
<p class="calibre1">something like thirty percent of our population are going to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">retirees or silicon rust belt victims. You want to see seventy year</p>
<p class="calibre1">olds freezing on street corners in New Jersey? That’s what your</p>
<p class="calibre1">attitude says to me: You’re not helping to support them, you’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">running away from your responsibilities right now, when we’ve got huge</p>
<p class="calibre1">problems to face. If we can just defuse the debt bomb, we could do so</p>
<p class="calibre1">much - fight the aging problem, fix the environment, heal society’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">ills. Instead you just piss away your talents handing no-hoper</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eurotrash get-rich-quick schemes that work, telling Vietnamese</p>
<p class="calibre1">zaibatsus what to build next to take jobs away from our taxpayers. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">mean, why? Why do you keep doing this? Why can’t you simply come home</p>

<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">They share a long look of mutual incomprehension.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,” she says awkwardly, “I’m around for a couple of days. I really</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She extends a fingertip. After a moment’s hesitation, Manfred extends</p>
<p class="calibre1">a fingertip of his own. They touch, exchanging vCards and</p>
<p class="calibre1">instant-messaging handles. She stands and stalks from the breakfast</p>
<p class="calibre1">room, and Manfred’s breath catches at a flash of ankle through the</p>
<p class="calibre1">slit in her skirt, which is long enough to comply with workplace</p>
<p class="calibre1">sexual harassment codes back home. Her presence conjures up memories</p>
<p class="calibre1">of her tethered passion, the red afterglow of a sound thrashing. She’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying to drag him into her orbit again, he thinks dizzily. She knows</p>
<p class="calibre1">she can have this effect on him any time she wants: She’s got the</p>
<p class="calibre1">private keys to his hypothalamus, and sod the metacortex. Three</p>
<p class="calibre1">billion years of reproductive determinism have given her</p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty-first-century ideology teeth: If she’s finally decided to</p>
<p class="calibre1">conscript his gametes into the war against impending population crash,</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’ll find it hard to fight back. The only question: Is it business or</p>

<p class="calibre1">She looks perplexed. “What kittens?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s not talk about that. Why this bar?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She frowns. “I had to find you as soon as possible. I keep hearing</p>
<p class="calibre1">rumors about some KGB plot you’re mixed up in, how you’re some sort of</p>
<p class="calibre1">communist spy. It isn’t true, is it?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“True?” He shakes his head, bemused. “The KGB hasn’t existed for more</p>
<p class="calibre1">than twenty years.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be careful, Manny. I don’t want to lose you. That’s an order.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Please.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The floor creaks, and he looks round. Dreadlocks and dark glasses with</p>
<p class="calibre1">flickering lights behind them: Bob Franklin. Manfred vaguely remembers</p>
<p class="calibre1">with a twinge that he left with Miss Arianespace leaning on his arm,</p>
<p class="calibre1">shortly before things got seriously inebriated. She was hot, but in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">different direction from Pamela, he decides: Bob looks none the worse</p>
<p class="calibre1">for wear. Manfred makes introductions. “Bob, meet Pam, my fianc�e.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pam? Meet Bob.” Bob puts a full glass down in front of him; he has no</p>
<p class="calibre1">idea what’s in it, but it would be rude not to drink.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure thing. Uh, Manfred, can I have a word? About your idea last</p>
<p class="calibre1">night?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Feel free. Present company is trustworthy.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bob raises an eyebrow at that, but continues anyway. “It’s about the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fab concept. I’ve got a team of my guys doing some prototyping using</p>
<p class="calibre1">FabLab hardware, and I think we can probably build it. The cargo-cult</p>
<p class="calibre1">aspect puts a new spin on the old Lunar von Neumann factory idea, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bingo and Marek say they think it should work until we can bootstrap</p>
<p class="calibre1">all the way to a native nanolithography ecology: we run the whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing from Earth as a training lab and ship up the parts that are too</p>
<p class="calibre1">difficult to make on-site as we learn how to do it properly. We use</p>
<p class="calibre1">FPGAs for all critical electronics and keep it parsimonious - you’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">right about it buying us the self-replicating factory a few years</p>
<p class="calibre1">ahead of the robotics curve. But I’m wondering about on-site</p>
<p class="calibre1">intelligence. Once the comet gets more than a couple of light-minutes</p>
<p class="calibre1">away -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can’t control it. Feedback lag. So you want a crew, right?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah. But we can’t send humans - way too expensive, besides it’s a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fifty-year run even if we build the factory on a chunk of short-period</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kuiper belt ejecta. And I don’t think we’re up to coding the kind of</p>
<p class="calibre1">AI that could control such a factory any time this decade. So what do</p>
<p class="calibre1">you have in mind?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let me think.” Pamela glares at Manfred for a while before he notices</p>
<p class="calibre1">her: “Yeah?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s going on? What’s this all about?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Franklin shrugs expansively, dreadlocks clattering: “Manfred’s helping</p>
<p class="calibre1">me explore the solution space to a manufacturing problem.” He grins.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t know Manny had a fiance. Drink’s on me.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She glances at Manfred, who is gazing into whatever weirdly colored</p>
<p class="calibre1">space his metacortex is projecting on his glasses, fingers twitching.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Coolly: “Our engagement was on hold while he thought about his</p>
<p class="calibre1">future.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, right. We didn’t bother with that sort of thing in my day; like,</p>
<p class="calibre1">too formal, man.” Franklin looks uncomfortable. “He’s been very</p>
<p class="calibre1">helpful. Pointed us at a whole new line of research we hadn’t thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">of. It’s long-term and a bit speculative, but if it works, it’ll put</p>
<p class="calibre1">us a whole generation ahead in the off-planet infrastructure field.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will it help reduce the budget deficit, though?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Reduce the -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred stretches and yawns: The visionary is returning from planet</p>
<p class="calibre1">Macx. “Bob, if I can solve your crew problem, can you book me a slot</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the deep-space tracking network? Like, enough to transmit a couple</p>
<p class="calibre1">of gigabytes? That’s going to take some serious bandwidth, I know, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">if you can do it, I think I can get you exactly the kind of crew</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re looking for.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Franklin looks dubious. “Gigabytes? The DSN isn’t built for that!</p>
<p class="calibre1">You’re talking days. And what do you mean about a crew? What kind of</p>
<p class="calibre1">deal do you think I’m putting together? We can’t afford to add a whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">new tracking network or life-support system just to run -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Relax.” Pamela glances at Manfred. “Manny, why don’t you tell him why</p>
<p class="calibre1">you want the bandwidth? Maybe then he could tell you if it’s possible,</p>
<p class="calibre1">or if there’s some other way to do it.” She smiles at Franklin: “I’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">found that he usually makes more sense if you can get him to explain</p>
<p class="calibre1">his reasoning. Usually.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If I -” Manfred stops. “Okay, Pam. Bob, it’s those KGB lobsters. They</p>
<p class="calibre1">want somewhere to go that’s insulated from human space. I figure I can</p>
<p class="calibre1">get them to sign on as crew for your cargo-cult self-replicating</p>
<p class="calibre1">factories, but they’ll want an insurance policy: hence the deep-space</p>
<p class="calibre1">tracking network. I figured we could beam a copy of them at the alien</p>
<p class="calibre1">Matrioshka brains around M31 -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“KGB?” Pam’s voice is rising: “You said you weren’t mixed up in spy</p>
<p class="calibre1">stuff!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Relax, it’s just the Moscow Windows NT user group, not the FSB. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">uploaded crusties hacked in and -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bob is watching him oddly. “Lobsters?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.” Manfred stares right back. “Panulirus interruptus uploads.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Something tells me you might have heard of it?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Moscow.” Bob leans back against the wall: “how did you hear about</p>
<p class="calibre1">it?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They phoned me.” With heavy irony: “It’s hard for an upload to stay</p>
<p class="calibre1">subsentient these days, even if it’s just a crustacean. Bezier labs</p>
<p class="calibre1">have a lot to answer for.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pamela’s face is unreadable. “Bezier labs?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They escaped.” Manfred shrugs. “It’s not their fault. This Bezier</p>
<p class="calibre1">dude. Is he by any chance ill?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I -” Pamela stops. “I shouldn’t be talking about work.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re not wearing your chaperone now,” he nudges quietly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She inclines her head. “Yes, he’s ill. Some sort of brain tumor they</p>
<p class="calibre1">can’t hack.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Franklin nods. “That’s the trouble with cancer - the ones that are</p>
<p class="calibre1">left to worry about are the rare ones. No cure.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, then.” Manfred chugs the remains of his glass of beer. “That</p>
<p class="calibre1">explains his interest in uploading. Judging by the crusties, he’s on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the right track. I wonder if he’s moved on to vertebrates yet?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cats,” says Pamela. “He was hoping to trade their uploads to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pentagon as a new smart bomb guidance system in lieu of income tax</p>
<p class="calibre1">payments. Something about remapping enemy targets to look like mice or</p>
<p class="calibre1">birds or something before feeding it to their sensorium. The old</p>
<p class="calibre1">kitten and laser pointer trick.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred stares at her, hard. “That’s not very nice. Uploaded cats are</p>
<p class="calibre1">a bad idea.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thirty-million-dollar tax bills aren’t nice either, Manfred. That’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">lifetime nursing-home care for a hundred blameless pensioners.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Franklin leans back, sourly amused, keeping out of the crossfire.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The lobsters are sentient,” Manfred persists. “What about those poor</p>
<p class="calibre1">kittens? Don’t they deserve minimal rights? How about you? How would</p>
<p class="calibre1">you like to wake up a thousand times inside a smart bomb, fooled into</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking that some Cheyenne Mountain battle computer’s target of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hour is your heart’s desire? How would you like to wake up a thousand</p>
<p class="calibre1">times, only to die again? Worse: The kittens are probably not going to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be allowed to run. They’re too fucking dangerous - they grow up into</p>
<p class="calibre1">cats, solitary and highly efficient killing machines. With</p>
<p class="calibre1">intelligence and no socialization they’ll be too dangerous to have</p>
<p class="calibre1">around. They’re prisoners, Pam, raised to sentience only to discover</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’re under a permanent death sentence. How fair is that?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But they’re only uploads.” Pamela stares at him. “Software, right?</p>
<p class="calibre1">You could reinstantiate them on another hardware platform, like, say,</p>
<p class="calibre1">your Aineko. So the argument about killing them doesn’t really apply,</p>
<p class="calibre1">does it?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So? We’re going to be uploading humans in a couple of years. I think</p>
<p class="calibre1">we need to take a rain check on the utilitarian philosophy, before it</p>
<p class="calibre1">bites us on the cerebral cortex. Lobsters, kittens, humans — it’s a</p>
<p class="calibre1">slippery slope.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Franklin clears his throat. “I’ll be needing an NDA and various</p>
<p class="calibre1">due-diligence statements off you for the crusty pilot idea,” he says</p>
<p class="calibre1">to Manfred. “Then I’ll have to approach Jim about buying the IP.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No can do.” Manfred leans back and smiles lazily. “I’m not going to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be a party to depriving them of their civil rights. Far as I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">concerned, they’re free citizens. Oh, and I patented the whole idea of</p>
<p class="calibre1">using lobster-derived AI autopilots for spacecraft this morning - it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">logged all over the place, all rights assigned to the FIF. Either you</p>
<p class="calibre1">give them a contract of employment, or the whole thing’s off.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But they’re just software! Software based on fucking lobsters, for</p>
<p class="calibre1">God’s sake! I’m not even sure they are sentient - I mean, they’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">what, a ten-million-neuron network hooked up to a syntax engine and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">crappy knowledge base? What kind of basis for intelligence is that?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred’s finger jabs out: “That’s what they’ll say about you, Bob. Do</p>
<p class="calibre1">it. Do it or don’t even think about uploading out of meatspace when</p>
<p class="calibre1">your body packs in, because your life won’t be worth living. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">precedent you set here determines how things are done tomorrow. Oh,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and feel free to use this argument on Jim Bezier. He’ll get the point</p>
<p class="calibre1">eventually, after you beat him over the head with it. Some kinds of</p>
<p class="calibre1">intellectual land grab just shouldn’t be allowed.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lobsters - ” Franklin shakes his head. “Lobsters, cats. You’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">serious, aren’t you? You think they should be treated as</p>
<p class="calibre1">human-equivalent?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not so much that they should be treated as human-equivalent, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">that, if they aren’t treated as people, it’s quite possible that other</p>
<p class="calibre1">uploaded beings won’t be treated as people either. You’re setting a</p>
<p class="calibre1">legal precedent, Bob. I know of six other companies doing uploading</p>
<p class="calibre1">work right now, and not one of ‘em’s thinking about the legal status</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the uploaded. If you don’t start thinking about it now, where are</p>
<p class="calibre1">you going to be in three to five years’ time?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pam is looking back and forth between Franklin and Manfred like a bot</p>
<p class="calibre1">stuck in a loop, unable to quite grasp what she’s seeing. “How much is</p>
<p class="calibre1">this worth?” she asks plaintively.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, quite a few million, I guess.” Bob stares at his empty glass.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay. I’ll talk to them. If they bite, you’re dining out on me for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the next century. You really think they’ll be able to run the mining</p>
<p class="calibre1">complex?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re pretty resourceful for invertebrates.” Manfred grins</p>
<p class="calibre1">innocently, enthusiastically. “They may be prisoners of their</p>
<p class="calibre1">evolutionary background, but they can still adapt to a new</p>
<p class="calibre1">environment. And just think, you’ll be winning civil rights for a</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole new minority group - one that won’t be a minority for much</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">That evening, Pamela turns up at Manfred’s hotel room wearing a</p>
<p class="calibre1">strapless black dress, concealing spike-heeled boots and most of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">items he bought for her that afternoon. Manfred has opened up his</p>
<p class="calibre1">private diary to her agents. She abuses the privilege, zaps him with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">stunner on his way out of the shower, and has him gagged,</p>
<p class="calibre1">spread-eagled, and trussed to the bed frame before he has a chance to</p>
<p class="calibre1">speak. She wraps a large rubber pouch full of mildly anesthetic lube</p>
<p class="calibre1">around his tumescent genitals - no point in letting him climax - clips</p>
<p class="calibre1">electrodes to his nipples, lubes a rubber plug up his rectum and</p>
<p class="calibre1">straps it in place. Before the shower, he removed his goggles. She</p>
<p class="calibre1">resets them, plugs them into her handheld, and gently eases them on</p>
<p class="calibre1">over his eyes. There’s other apparatus, stuff she ran up on the hotel</p>
<p class="calibre1">room’s 3D printer.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Setup completed, she walks round the bed, inspecting him critically</p>
<p class="calibre1">from all angles, figuring out where to begin. This isn’t just sex,</p>
<p class="calibre1">after all: It’s a work of art.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a moment’s thought, she rolls socks onto his exposed feet, then,</p>
<p class="calibre1">expertly wielding a tiny tube of cyanoacrylate, glues his fingertips</p>
<p class="calibre1">together. Then she switches off the air conditioning. He’s twisting</p>
<p class="calibre1">and straining, testing the cuffs. Tough, it’s about the nearest thing</p>
<p class="calibre1">to sensory deprivation she can arrange without a flotation tank and</p>
<p class="calibre1">suxamethonium injection. She controls all his senses, only his ears</p>
<p class="calibre1">unstoppered. The glasses give her a high-bandwidth channel right into</p>
<p class="calibre1">his brain, a fake metacortex to whisper lies at her command. The idea</p>
<p class="calibre1">of what she’s about to do excites her, puts a tremor in her thighs:</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s the first time she’s been able to get inside his mind as well as</p>
<p class="calibre1">his body. She leans forward and whispers in his ear, “Manfred, can you</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear me?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He twitches. Mouth gagged, fingers glued. Good. No back channels. He’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">powerless.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is what it’s like to be tetraplegic, Manfred. Bedridden with</p>
<p class="calibre1">motor neuron disease. Locked inside your own body by nv-CJD from</p>
<p class="calibre1">eating too many contaminated burgers. I could spike you with MPTP, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’d stay in this position for the rest of your life, shitting in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bag, pissing through a tube. Unable to talk and with nobody to look</p>
<p class="calibre1">after you. Do you think you’d like that?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s trying to grunt or whimper around the ball gag. She hikes her</p>
<p class="calibre1">skirt up around her waist and climbs onto the bed, straddling him. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">goggles are replaying scenes she picked up around Cambridge the</p>
<p class="calibre1">previous winter - soup kitchen scenes, hospice scenes. She kneels atop</p>
<p class="calibre1">him, whispering in his ear.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Twelve million in tax, baby, that’s what they think you owe them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What do you think you owe me? That’s six million in net income, Manny,</p>
<p class="calibre1">six million that isn’t going into your virtual children’s mouths.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s rolling his head from side to side, as if trying to argue. That</p>
<p class="calibre1">won’t do; she slaps him hard, thrills to his frightened expression.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Today I watched you give uncounted millions away, Manny. Millions, to</p>
<p class="calibre1">a bunch of crusties and a MassPike pirate! You bastard. Do you know</p>
<p class="calibre1">what I should do with you?” He’s cringing, unsure whether she’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">serious or doing this just to get him turned on. Good.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s no point trying to hold a conversation. She leans forward</p>
<p class="calibre1">until she can feel his breath in her ear. “Meat and mind, Manny. Meat,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and mind. You’re not interested in meat, are you? Just mind. You could</p>
<p class="calibre1">be boiled alive before you noticed what was happening in the meatspace</p>
<p class="calibre1">around you. Just another lobster in a pot. The only thing keeping you</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of it is how much I love you.” She reaches down and tears away the</p>
<p class="calibre1">gel pouch, exposing his penis: it’s stiff as a post from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">vasodilators, dripping with gel, numb. Straightening up, she eases</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself slowly down on it. It doesn’t hurt as much as she expected,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the sensation is utterly different from what she’s used to. She</p>
<p class="calibre1">begins to lean forward, grabs hold of his straining arms, feels his</p>
<p class="calibre1">thrilling helplessness. She can’t control herself: She almost bites</p>
<p class="calibre1">through her lip with the intensity of the sensation. Afterward, she</p>
<p class="calibre1">reaches down and massages him until he begins to spasm, shuddering</p>
<p class="calibre1">uncontrollably, emptying the Darwinian river of his source code into</p>
<p class="calibre1">her, communicating via his only output device.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She rolls off his hips and carefully uses the last of the superglue to</p>
<p class="calibre1">gum her labia together. Humans don’t produce seminiferous plugs, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">although she’s fertile, she wants to be absolutely sure. The glue will</p>
<p class="calibre1">last for a day or two. She feels hot and flushed, almost out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">control. Boiling to death with febrile expectancy, she’s nailed him</p>
<p class="calibre1">down at last.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">When she removes his glasses, his eyes are naked and vulnerable,</p>
<p class="calibre1">stripped down to the human kernel of his nearly transcendent mind.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can come and sign the marriage license tomorrow morning after</p>
<p class="calibre1">breakfast,” she whispers in his ear: “Otherwise, my lawyers will be in</p>
<p class="calibre1">touch. Your parents will want a ceremony, but we can arrange that</p>
<p class="calibre1">later.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looks as if he has something to say, so she finally relents and</p>
<p class="calibre1">loosens the gag, then kisses him tenderly on one cheek. He swallows,</p>
<p class="calibre1">coughs, and looks away. “Why? Why do it this way?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She taps him on the chest. “It’s all about property rights.” She</p>
<p class="calibre1">pauses for a moment’s thought: There’s a huge ideological chasm to</p>
<p class="calibre1">bridge, after all. “You finally convinced me about this agalmic thing</p>
<p class="calibre1">of yours, this giving everything away for brownie points. I wasn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">going to lose you to a bunch of lobsters or uploaded kittens, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatever else is going to inherit this smart-matter singularity you’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">busy creating. So I decided to take what’s mine first. Who knows? In a</p>
<p class="calibre1">few months, I’ll give you back a new intelligence, and you can look</p>
<p class="calibre1">after it to your heart’s content.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you didn’t need to do it this way -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Didn’t I?” She slides off the bed and pulls down her dress. “You give</p>
<p class="calibre1">too much away too easily, Manny! Slow down, or there won’t be anything</p>
<p class="calibre1">left.” Leaning over the bed she dribbles acetone onto the fingers of</p>
