<h2 id="calibre_toc_12" class="calibre3">Chapter 6: Nightfall</h2><p class="calibre1">A synthetic gemstone the size of a Coke can falls through silent</p>
<p class="calibre1">darkness. The night is quiet as the grave, colder than midwinter on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pluto. Gossamer sails as fine as soap bubbles droop, the gust of</p>
<p class="calibre1">sapphire laser light that inflated them long since darkened. Ancient</p>
<p class="calibre1">starlight picks out the outline of a huge planetlike body beneath the</p>
<p class="calibre1">jewel-and-cobweb corpse of the starwhisp.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eight Earth years have passed since the good ship Field Circus slipped</p>
<p class="calibre1">into close orbit around the frigid brown dwarf Hyundai +4904/[-56].</p>
<p class="calibre1">Five years have gone by since the launch lasers of the Ring Imperium</p>
<p class="calibre1">shut down without warning, stranding the light-sail-powered craft</p>
<p class="calibre1">three light-years from home. There has been no response from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">router, the strange alien artifact in orbit around the brown dwarf,</p>
<p class="calibre1">since the crew of the starwhisp uploaded themselves through its</p>
<p class="calibre1">strange quantum entanglement interface for transmission to whatever</p>
<p class="calibre1">alien network it connects to. In fact, nothing happens; nothing save</p>
<p class="calibre1">the slow trickle of seconds, as a watchdog timer counts down the</p>
<p class="calibre1">moments remaining until it is due to resurrect stored snapshots of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">crew, on the assumption that their uploaded copies are beyond help.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, outside the light cone -</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber jolts into wakefulness, as if from a nightmare. She sits bolt</p>
<p class="calibre1">upright, a thin sheet falling from her chest; air circulating around</p>
<p class="calibre1">her back chills her rapidly, cold sweat evaporating. She mutters</p>
<p class="calibre1">aloud, unable to subvocalize, “Where am I - oh. A bedroom. How did I</p>
<p class="calibre1">get here?” Mumble. “Oh, I see.” Her eyes widen in horror. “It’s not a</p>
<p class="calibre1">dream …”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Greetings, human Amber,” says a ghost-voice that seems to come from</p>
<p class="calibre1">nowhere: “I see you are awake. Would you like anything?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber rubs her eyes tiredly. Leaning against the bedstead, she glances</p>
<p class="calibre1">around cautiously. She takes in a bedside mirror, her reflection in</p>
<p class="calibre1">it: a young woman, gaunt in the manner of those whose genome bears the</p>
<p class="calibre1">p53 calorie-restriction hack, she has disheveled blonde hair and dark</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes. She could pass for a dancer or a soldier; not, perhaps, a queen.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s going on? Where am I? Who are you, and what am I doing in your</p>
<p class="calibre1">head?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her eyes narrow. Analytical intellect comes to the fore as she takes</p>
<p class="calibre1">stock of her surroundings. “The router,” she mutters. Structures of</p>
<p class="calibre1">strange matter orbit a brown dwarf scant light-years from Earth. “How</p>
<p class="calibre1">long ago did we come through?” Glancing round, she sees a room walled</p>
<p class="calibre1">in slabs of close-fitting stone. A window bay is recessed into them,</p>
<p class="calibre1">after the style of the Crusader castles many centuries in the past,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but there’s no glass in it - just a blank white screen. The only</p>
<p class="calibre1">furniture in the room, besides a Persian carpet on the cold</p>
<p class="calibre1">flagstones, is the bed she sits upon. She’s reminded of a scene from</p>
<p class="calibre1">an old movie, Kubrick’s enigma; this whole set-up has got to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">deliberate, and it isn’t funny.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m waiting,” she announces, and leans back against the headboard.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“According to our records this reaction indicates that you are now</p>
<p class="calibre1">fully self-aware,” says the ghost. “This is good. You have not been</p>
<p class="calibre1">conscious for a very long time. Explanations will be complex and</p>
<p class="calibre1">discursive. Can I offer you refreshments? What would you like?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Coffee, if you have it. Bread and hummus. Something to wear.” Amber</p>
<p class="calibre1">crosses her arms, abruptly self-conscious. “I’d prefer to have</p>
<p class="calibre1">management ackles to this universe, though. As realities go, it’s a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bit lacking in creature comforts.” Which isn’t entirely true - it</p>
<p class="calibre1">seems to have a comprehensive, human-friendly biophysics model, it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">not just a jumped-up first-person shooter. Her eyes focus on her left</p>
<p class="calibre1">forearm, where tanned skin and a puckered dime of scar tissue record a</p>
<p class="calibre1">youthful accident with a pressure seal in Jovian orbit. Amber freezes</p>
<p class="calibre1">for a moment. Her lips move in silence, but she’s locked into place in</p>
<p class="calibre1">this universe, unable to split or conjoin nested realities just by</p>
<p class="calibre1">calling subroutines that have been spliced into the corners of her</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind since she was a teenager. Finally, she asks, “How long have I</p>
<p class="calibre1">been dead?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Longer than you were alive, by orders of magnitude,” says the ghost.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A tray laden with pita breads, hummus, and olives congeals from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">air above her bed, and a wardrobe appears at one side of the room. “I</p>
<p class="calibre1">can begin the explanation now or wait for you to finish eating. Which</p>
<p class="calibre1">would you prefer?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber glances about again, then fixes on the white screen in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">window bay. “Give it to me right now. I can take it,” she says,</p>
<p class="calibre1">quietly bitter. “I like to understand my mistakes as soon as</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We-us can tell that you are a human of determination,” says the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ghost, a hint of pride entering its voice. “That is a good thing,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber. You will need all of your resolve if you are going to survive</p>
<p class="calibre1">here …”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is the time of repentance in a temple beside a tower that looms</p>
<p class="calibre1">above a dry plain, and the thoughts of the priest who lives in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tower are tinged with regret. It is Ashura, the tenth day of Muhurram,</p>
<p class="calibre1">according to a realtime clock still tuned to the pace of a different</p>
<p class="calibre1">era: the one thousand, three hundred and fortieth anniversary of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">martyrdom of the Third Imam, the Sayyid ash-Shuhada.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The priest of the tower has spent an indefinite time in prayer, locked</p>
<p class="calibre1">in an eternal moment of meditation and recitation. Now, as the vast</p>
<p class="calibre1">red sun drifts close to the horizon of the infinite desert, his</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughts drift toward the present. Ashura is a very special day, a day</p>
<p class="calibre1">of atonement for collective guilt, evil committed through inactivity;</p>
<p class="calibre1">but it is in Sadeq’s nature to look outwards toward the future. This</p>
<p class="calibre1">is, he knows, a failing - but also characteristic of his generation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s the generation of the Shi’ite clergy that reacted to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">excesses of the previous century, the generation that withdrew the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ulama from temporal power, retreated from the velyat i-faqih of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Khomenei and his successors, left government to the people, and began</p>
<p class="calibre1">to engage fully with the paradoxes of modernity. Sadeq’s focus, his</p>
<p class="calibre1">driving obsession in theology, is a program of reappraisal of</p>
<p class="calibre1">eschatology and cosmology. Here in a tower of white sun-baked clay, on</p>
<p class="calibre1">an endless plain that exists only in the imaginary spaces of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">starship the size of a soft drink can, the priest spends his processor</p>
<p class="calibre1">cycles in contemplation of one of the most vicious problems ever to</p>
<p class="calibre1">confront a mujtahid - the Fermi paradox.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Enrico Fermi was eating his lunch one day, and his colleagues were</p>
<p class="calibre1">discussing the possibility that sophisticated civilizations might</p>
<p class="calibre1">populate other worlds. “Yes,” he said, “but if this is so, why haven’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">they already come visiting?”)</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sadeq finishes his evening devotions in near silence, then stands,</p>
<p class="calibre1">stretches as is his wont, and leaves the small and lonely courtyard at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the base of the tower. The gate - a wrought-iron gate, warmed by</p>
<p class="calibre1">sunlight - squeals slightly as he opens it. Glancing at the upper</p>
<p class="calibre1">hinge, he frowns, willing it clean and whole. The underlying physics</p>
<p class="calibre1">model acknowledges his access controls: a thin rim of red around the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pin turns silvery-fresh, and the squeaking ceases. Closing the gate</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind him, Sadeq enters the tower.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He climbs with a heavy, even tread a spiral staircase snaking ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">upward above him. Narrow slit-windows line the outer wall of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">staircase. Through each of them he sees a different world. Out there,</p>
<p class="calibre1">nightfall in the month of Ramadan. And through the next, green misty</p>
<p class="calibre1">skies and a horizon too close by far. Sadeq carefully avoids thinking</p>
<p class="calibre1">about the implications of this manifold space. Coming from prayer,</p>
<p class="calibre1">from a sense of the sacred, he doesn’t want to lose his proximity to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his faith. He’s far enough from home as it is, and there is much to</p>
<p class="calibre1">consider. He is surrounded by strange and curious ideas, all but lost</p>
<p class="calibre1">in a corrosive desert of faith.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the top of the staircase, Sadeq comes to a door of aged wood bound</p>
<p class="calibre1">in iron. It doesn’t belong here: It’s a cultural and architectural</p>
<p class="calibre1">anomaly. The handle is a loop of black metal. Sadeq regards it as if</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s the head of an asp, poised to sting. Nevertheless, he reaches out</p>
<p class="calibre1">and turns the handle, steps across the threshold into a palace out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">fantasy.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">None of this is real, he reminds himself. It’s no more real than an</p>
<p class="calibre1">illusion conjured by one of the jinni of the thousand nights and one</p>
<p class="calibre1">night. Nevertheless, he can’t save himself from smiling at the scene -</p>
<p class="calibre1">a sardonic smile of self-deprecating humor, tempered by frustration.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sadeq’s captors have stolen his soul and locked it - him - in a very</p>
<p class="calibre1">strange prison, a temple with a tower that rises all the way to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Paradise. It’s the whole classical litany of medievalist desires,</p>
<p class="calibre1">distilled from fifteen hundred years of literature. Colonnaded</p>
<p class="calibre1">courtyards, cool pools lined with rich mosaics, rooms filled with</p>
<p class="calibre1">every imaginable dumb matter luxury, endless banquets awaiting his</p>
<p class="calibre1">appetite - and dozens of beautiful un-women, eager to fulfill his</p>
<p class="calibre1">every fantasy. Sadeq, being human, has fantasies by the dozen, but he</p>
<p class="calibre1">doesn’t dare permit himself to succumb to temptation. I’m not dead, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">reasons. Therefore, how can I be in Paradise? Therefore, this must be</p>
<p class="calibre1">a false paradise, a temptation sent to lead me astray. Probably.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Unless I am dead, because Allah, peace be unto him, considers a human</p>
<p class="calibre1">soul separated from its body to be dead. But if that’s so, isn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">uploading a sin? In which case, this can’t be Paradise because I am a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sinner. Besides which, this whole setup is so puerile!</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sadeq has always been inclined to philosophical inquiry, and his</p>
<p class="calibre1">vision of the afterlife is more cerebral than most, involving ideas as</p>
<p class="calibre1">questionable within the framework of Islam as those of Teilhard de</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chardin were to the twentieth-century Catholic church. If there’s one</p>
<p class="calibre1">key indicator of a false paradise in his eschatology, it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">two-and-seventy brainlessly beautiful houris waiting to do his</p>
<p class="calibre1">bidding. So it follows that he can’t really be dead …</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The whole question of reality is so vexing that Sadeq does what he</p>
<p class="calibre1">does every night. He strides heedlessly across priceless works of art,</p>
<p class="calibre1">barging hastily through courtyards and passageways, ignoring niches in</p>
<p class="calibre1">which nearly naked supermodels lie with their legs apart, climbing</p>
<p class="calibre1">stairs - until he comes to a small unfurnished room with a single high</p>
<p class="calibre1">window in one wall. There he sits on the floor, legs crossed,</p>
<p class="calibre1">meditating; not in prayer, but in a more tightly focused</p>
<p class="calibre1">ratiocination. Every false night (for there is no way to know how fast</p>
<p class="calibre1">time is passing, outside this cyberspace pocket), Sadeq sits and</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinks, grappling with Descartes’s demon in the solitude of his own</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind. And the question he asks himself every night is the same: Can I</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell if this is the true hell? And if it is not, how can I escape?</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ghost tells Amber that she has been dead for just under a third of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a million years. She has been reinstantiated from storage - and has</p>
<p class="calibre1">died again - many times in the intervening period, but she has no</p>
<p class="calibre1">memory of this; she is a fork from the main bough, and the other</p>
<p class="calibre1">branches expired in lonely isolation.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The business of resurrection does not, in and of itself, distress</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber unduly. Born in the post-Moravec era, she merely finds some</p>
<p class="calibre1">aspects of the ghost’s description dissatisfyingly incomplete. It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">like saying she was drugged and brought hither without stating whether</p>
<p class="calibre1">by plane, train, or automobile.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She doesn’t have a problem with the ghost’s assertion that she is</p>
<p class="calibre1">nowhere near Earth - indeed, that she is approximately eighty thousand</p>
<p class="calibre1">light-years away. When she and the others took the risk of uploading</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves through the router they found in orbit around Hyundai</p>
<p class="calibre1">+4904/[-56] they’d understood that they could end up anywhere or</p>
<p class="calibre1">nowhere. But the idea that she’s still within the light cone of her</p>
<p class="calibre1">departure strikes her as dubious. The original SETI broadcast strongly</p>
<p class="calibre1">implied that the router is part of a network of self-replicating</p>
<p class="calibre1">instantaneous communicators, spawning and spreading between the cold</p>
<p class="calibre1">brown dwarf stars that litter the galaxy. She’d somehow expected to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">much farther from home by now.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somewhat more disturbing is the ghost’s assertion that the human</p>
<p class="calibre1">genotype has rendered itself extinct at least twice, that its home</p>
<p class="calibre1">planet is unknown, and that Amber is nearly the only human left in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">public archives. At this point, she interrupts. “I hardly see what</p>
<p class="calibre1">this has to do with me!” Then she blows across her coffee glass,</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying to cool the contents. “I’m dead,” she explains, with an</p>
<p class="calibre1">undertone of knowing sarcasm in her voice. “Remember? I just got here.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A thousand seconds ago, subjective time, I was in the control node of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a starship, discussing what to do with the router we were in orbit</p>
<p class="calibre1">around. We agreed to send ourselves through it, as a trade mission.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then I woke up in bed here in the umpty-zillionth century, wherever</p>
<p class="calibre1">and whatever here is. Without access to any reality ackles or</p>
<p class="calibre1">augmentation, I can’t even tell whether this is real or an embedded</p>
<p class="calibre1">simulation. You’re going to have to explain why you need an old</p>
<p class="calibre1">version of me before I can make sense of my situation - and I can tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">you, I’m not going to help you until I know who you are. And speaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">of that, what about the others? Where are they? I wasn’t the only one,</p>
<p class="calibre1">you know?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ghost freezes in place for a moment, and Amber feels a watery rush</p>
<p class="calibre1">of terror: Have I gone too far? she wonders.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There has been an unfortunate accident,” the ghost announces</p>
<p class="calibre1">portentously. It morphs from a translucent copy of Amber’s own body</p>
<p class="calibre1">into the outline of a human skeleton, elaborate bony extensions</p>
<p class="calibre1">simulating an osteosarcoma of more-than-lethal proportions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Consensus-we believe that you are best positioned to remediate the</p>
<p class="calibre1">situation. This applies within the demilitarized zone.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Demilitarized?” Amber shakes her head, pauses to sip her coffee.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you mean? What is this place?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ghost flickers again, adopting an abstract rotating hypercube as</p>
<p class="calibre1">its avatar. “This space we occupy is a manifold adjacent to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">demilitarized zone. The demilitarized zone is a space outside our core</p>
<p class="calibre1">reality, itself exposed to entities that cross freely through our</p>
<p class="calibre1">firewall, journeying to and from the network outside. We-us use the</p>
<p class="calibre1">DMZ to establish the informational value of migrant entities, sapient</p>
<p class="calibre1">currency units and the like. We-us banked you upon arrival against</p>
<p class="calibre1">future options trades in human species futures.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Currency!” Amber doesn’t know whether to be amused or horrified -</p>
<p class="calibre1">both reactions seem appropriate. “Is that how you treat all your</p>
<p class="calibre1">visitors?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ghost ignores her question. “There is a runaway semiotic excursion</p>
<p class="calibre1">under way in the zone. We-us believe only you can fix it. If you agree</p>
<p class="calibre1">to do, so we will exchange value, pay, reward cooperation, expedite</p>
<p class="calibre1">remuneration, manumit, repatriate.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber drains her coffee cup. “Have you ever entered into economic</p>
<p class="calibre1">interactions with me, or humans like me, before?” she asks. “If not,</p>
<p class="calibre1">why should I trust you? If so, why have you revived me? Are there any</p>
<p class="calibre1">more experienced instances of myself running around here?” She raises</p>
<p class="calibre1">a skeptical eyebrow at the ghost. “This looks like the start of an</p>
<p class="calibre1">abusive relationship.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ghost continues to sidestep her attempts to work out where she</p>
<p class="calibre1">stands. It flickers into transparency, grows into a hazy window on a</p>
<p class="calibre1">landscape of impossible shapes. Clouds sprouting trees drift above a</p>
<p class="calibre1">landscape of green, egg-curved hills and cheesecake castles. “Nature</p>
<p class="calibre1">of excursion: alien intelligence is loose in the DMZ,” it asserts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alien is applying invalid semiotics to complex structures designed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">sustain trade. You know this alien, Amber. We require solution. Slay</p>
<p class="calibre1">the monster, we will give you line of credit. Your own reality to</p>
<p class="calibre1">control, insight into trade arrangements, augmented senses, ability to</p>
<p class="calibre1">travel. Can even upgrade you to you-we consensus, if desired.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This monster.” Amber leans forward, staring into the window eagerly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She’s half-minded to ignore what she feels is a spurious offer; it</p>
<p class="calibre1">doesn’t sound too appetizing. Upgrade me to a ghost fragment of an</p>
<p class="calibre1">alien group mind? she wonders dismissively. “What is this alien?” She</p>
<p class="calibre1">feels blind and unsure, stripped of her ability to spawn threads of</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself to pursue complex inferences. “Is it part of the Wunch?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Datum unknown. It-them came with you,” says the ghost. “Accidentally</p>
<p class="calibre1">reactivated some seconds since now. It runs amok in the demilitarized</p>
<p class="calibre1">zone. Help us, Amber. Save our hub, or we will be cut off from the</p>

<p class="calibre1">Amber, aged eleven, is a gawky, long-limbed child loose on the</p>

<p class="calibre1">spaceplane and blasts her into orbit from Xinkiang. She’s free for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the time being, albeit mortgaged to the tune of several million</p>
<p class="calibre1">euros; she’s a little taikonaut to be, ready to work for the long</p>
<p class="calibre1">years in Jupiter orbit it will take her to pay off the</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-propelled options web that owns her. It’s not exactly slavery:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thanks to Dad’s corporate shell game she doesn’t have to worry</p>
<p class="calibre1">about Mom chasing her, trying to return her to the posthuman prison</p>
<p class="calibre1">of growing up just like an old-fashioned little girl. And now she’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">got a bit of pocket money, and a room in the Hilton, and her own</p>
<p class="calibre1">personal Franklin remote to keep her company, she’s decided she’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">gonna do that eighteenth-century-enlightenment tourist shit and do</p>
<p class="calibre1">it right.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because this is her last day at liberty in the randomly evolved</p>
<p class="calibre1">biosphere.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">China is where things are at in this decade, hot and dense and full</p>
<p class="calibre1">of draconian punishments for the obsolescent. Nationalist fervor to</p>
<p class="calibre1">catch up with the west has been replaced by consumerist fervor to</p>
<p class="calibre1">own the latest fad gadgets; the most picturesque tourist souvenirs</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the quaintly old-fashioned streets of America; the fastest,</p>
<p class="calibre1">hottest, smartest, upgrades for body and soul. Hong Kong is hotter</p>
<p class="calibre1">and faster than just about anywhere else in China, or in the whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">damn world for that matter. This is a place where tourists from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tokyo gawp, cowed and future-shocked by the glamour of</p>
<p class="calibre1">high-technology living.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walking along Jardine’s Bazaar - More like Jardine’s bizarre, she</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinks - exposes Amber to a blast of humid noise. Geodesic domes</p>
<p class="calibre1">sprout like skeletal mushrooms from the glass-and-chrome roofs of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the expensive shopping malls and luxury hotels, threatening to</p>
<p class="calibre1">float away on the hot sea breeze. There are no airliners roaring in</p>
<p class="calibre1">and out of Kai Tak anymore, no burnished aluminum storm clouds to</p>
<p class="calibre1">rain round-eyed passengers on the shopping malls and fish markets</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Kowloon and the New Territories. In these tense later days of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the War Against Unreason, impossible new shapes move in the sky;</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber gapes upward as a Shenyang F-30 climbs at a near-vertical</p>
<p class="calibre1">angle, a mess of incomprehensibly curved flight surfaces vanishing</p>
<p class="calibre1">to a perspective point that defies radar as well as eyeballs. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chinese - fighter? missile platform? supercomputer? - is heading</p>
<p class="calibre1">out over the South China Sea to join the endless patrol that</p>
<p class="calibre1">reassures the capitalist world that it is being guarded from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hosts of Denial, the Trouble out of Wa’hab.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the moment, she’s merely a precocious human child. Amber’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">subconscious is off-lined by the presence of forceful infowar</p>
<p class="calibre1">daemons, the Chinese government censorbots suppressing her</p>
<p class="calibre1">cognition of their deadliest weapons. And in the seconds while her</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind is as empty as a sucked egg, a thin-faced man with blue hair</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoves her in the small of her back and snatches at her shoulder</p>
<p class="calibre1">bag.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey!” she yells, stumbling. Her mind’s a blur, optics refusing to</p>
<p class="calibre1">respond and grab a biometric model of her assailant. It’s the</p>
<p class="calibre1">frozen moment, the dead zone when on-line coverage fails, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">thief is running away before she can catch her balance or try to</p>
<p class="calibre1">give chase. Plus, with her extensions off-line she doesn’t know how</p>
<p class="calibre1">to yell “stop, thief!” in Cantonese.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seconds later, the fighter is out of visual range and the state</p>
<p class="calibre1">censorship field lets up. “Get him, you bastards!” she screams, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">the curious shoppers simply stare at the rude foreign child: An</p>
<p class="calibre1">elderly woman brandishes a disposable phonecam at her and screeches</p>
<p class="calibre1">something back. Amber picks up her feet and runs. Already she can</p>
<p class="calibre1">feel the subsonics from her luggage growling at her guts - it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">going to make a scene if she doesn’t catch up in time. Shoppers</p>
<p class="calibre1">scatter, a woman with a baby carriage almost running her down in</p>
<p class="calibre1">her panic to get away from it.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">By the time Amber reaches her terrified shoulder bag, the thief has</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappeared: She has to spend almost a minute petting the scared</p>
<p class="calibre1">luggage before it stops screeching and retracts its spines enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">for her to pick it up. And by that time there’s a robocop in</p>
<p class="calibre1">attendance. “Identify yourself,” it rasps in synthetic English.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber stares at her bag in horror: There’s a huge gash in the side,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and it’s far too light. It’s gone, she thinks, despairingly. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">stole it. “Help,” she says faintly, holding up her bag for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">distant policeman looking through the robot’s eyes. “Been stolen.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What item missing?” asks the robot.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My Hello Kitty,” she says, batting her eyelashes, mendacity</p>
<p class="calibre1">full-on at maximum utilization, prodding her conscience into</p>
<p class="calibre1">submission, warning of dire consequences should the police discover</p>
<p class="calibre1">the true nature of her pet cat. “My kitten’s been stolen! Can you</p>
<p class="calibre1">help me?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Certainly,” says the cop, resting a reassuring hand on her</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulder - a hand that turns into a steel armband, as it pushes her</p>
<p class="calibre1">into a van and notifies her in formally stilted language that she</p>
<p class="calibre1">is under arrest on suspicion of shoplifting and will be required to</p>
<p class="calibre1">produce certificates of authenticity and a fully compliant</p>
<p class="calibre1">ownership audit for all items in her possession if she wants to</p>
<p class="calibre1">prove her innocence.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">By the time Amber’s meatbrain realizes that she is being politely</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrested, some of her external threads have already started yelling</p>
<p class="calibre1">for help and her m-commerce trackers have identified the station</p>
<p class="calibre1">she’s being taken to by way of click-thru trails and an obliging</p>
<p class="calibre1">software license manager. They spawn agents to go notify the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Franklin trustees, Amnesty International, the Space and Freedom</p>
<p class="calibre1">Party, and her father’s lawyers. As she’s being booked into a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cerise-and-turquoise juvenile offenders holding room by a</p>
<p class="calibre1">middle-aged policewoman, the phones on the front desk are already</p>
<p class="calibre1">ringing with inquiries from attorneys, fast-food vendors, and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">particularly on-the-ball celebrity magazine that’s been tracking</p>
<p class="calibre1">her father’s connections. “Can you help me get my cat back?” she</p>
<p class="calibre1">asks the policewoman earnestly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Name,” the officer reads, eyes flickering from the simultaneous</p>
<p class="calibre1">translation. “To please wax your identity stiffly.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My cat has been stolen,” Amber insists.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your cat?” The cop looks perplexed, then exasperated. Dealing with</p>
<p class="calibre1">foreign teenagers who answer questions with gibberish isn’t in her</p>
<p class="calibre1">repertoire. “We are asking your name?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” says Amber. “It’s my cat. It has been stolen. My cat has been</p>
<p class="calibre1">stolen.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aha! Your papers, please?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Papers?” Amber is growing increasingly worried. She can’t feel the</p>
<p class="calibre1">outside world; there’s a Faraday cage wrapped around the holding</p>
<p class="calibre1">cell, and it’s claustrophobically quiet inside. “I want my cat!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cop snaps her fingers, then reaches into her own pocket and</p>
<p class="calibre1">produces an ID card, which she points to insistently. “Papers,” she</p>
<p class="calibre1">repeats. “Or else.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know what you’re talking about!” Amber wails.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cop stares at her oddly. “Wait.” She rises and leaves, and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">minute later, returns with a thin-faced man in a business suit and</p>
<p class="calibre1">wire-rimmed glasses that glow faintly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You are making a scene,” he says, rudely and abruptly. “What is</p>
<p class="calibre1">your name? Tell me truthfully, or you’ll spend the night here.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber bursts into tears. “My cat’s been stolen,” she chokes out.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The detective and the cop obviously don’t know how to deal with</p>
<p class="calibre1">this scene; it’s freaking them out, with its overtones of emotional</p>
<p class="calibre1">messiness and sinister diplomatic entanglement. “You wait here,”</p>
<p class="calibre1">they say, and back out of the cell, leaving her alone with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">plastic animatronic koala and a cheap Lebanese coffee machine.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The implications of her loss - of Aineko’s abduction - are sinking</p>
<p class="calibre1">in, finally, and Amber is weeping loudly and hopelessly. It’s hard</p>
<p class="calibre1">to deal with bereavement and betrayal at any age, and the cat has</p>
<p class="calibre1">been her wisecracking companion and consolation for a year, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rock of certainty that gave her the strength to break free from her</p>
<p class="calibre1">crazy mother. To lose her cat to a body shop in Hong Kong, where</p>
<p class="calibre1">she will probably be cut up for spare circuitry or turned into soup</p>
<p class="calibre1">is too horrible to contemplate. Filled with despair and hopeless</p>
<p class="calibre1">anguish, Amber howls at the interrogation room walls while outside,</p>
<p class="calibre1">trapped threads of her consciousness search for backups to</p>
<p class="calibre1">synchronize with.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But after an hour, just as she’s quieting down into a slough of raw</p>
<p class="calibre1">despair, there’s a knock - a knock! - at the door. An inquisitive</p>
<p class="calibre1">head pops in. “Please to come with us?” It’s the female cop with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the bad translationware. She takes in Amber’s sobbing and tuts</p>
<p class="calibre1">under her breath, but as Amber stands up and shambles toward her,</p>
<p class="calibre1">she pulls back.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the front desk of a cubicle farm full of police bureaucrats in</p>
<p class="calibre1">various states of telepresence, the detective is waiting with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">damp cardboard box wrapped in twine. “Please identify,” he asks,</p>
<p class="calibre1">snipping the string.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber shakes her head, dizzy with the flow of threads homing in to</p>
<p class="calibre1">synchronize their memories with her. “Is it -” she begins to ask as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the lid comes apart, wet pulp disintegrating. A triangular head</p>
<p class="calibre1">pops up, curiously, sniffing the air. Bubbles blow from</p>
<p class="calibre1">brown-furred nostrils. “What took you so long?” asks the cat, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">she reaches into the box and picks her up, fur wet and matted with</p>
<p class="calibre1">seawater.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you want me to go fix your alien, for starters I want you to give</p>
<p class="calibre1">me reality alteration privileges,” says Amber. “Then I want you to</p>
<p class="calibre1">find the latest instances of everyone who came here with me - round up</p>
<p class="calibre1">the usual suspects - and give them root privileges, too. Then we’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">want access to the other embedded universes in the DMZ. Finally, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">want guns. Lots of guns.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That may be difficult,” says the ghost. “Many other humans reached</p>
<p class="calibre1">halting state long since. Is at least one other still alive, but not</p>
<p class="calibre1">accessible for duration of eschatological experiment in progress. Not</p>
<p class="calibre1">all were recorded with version control engine; others were-is lost in</p>
<p class="calibre1">DMZ. We-are can provide you with extreme access to the demilitarized</p>
<p class="calibre1">zone, but query the need for kinetic energy weapons.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber sighs. “You guys really are media illiterates, aren’t you?” She</p>
<p class="calibre1">stands up and stretches, feeling a facsimile of sleep’s enervation</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaching from her muscles. “I’ll also need my -” it’s on the tip of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her tongue: There’s something missing. “Hang on. There’s something</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve forgotten.” Something important, she thinks, puzzled. Something</p>
<p class="calibre1">that used to be around all the time that would … know? … purr? …</p>
<p class="calibre1">help? “Never mind,” she hears her lips say. “This other human. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">really want her. Non-negotiable. All right?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That may be difficult,” repeats the ghost. “Entity is looping in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">recursively confined universe.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eh?” Amber blinks at it. “Would you mind rephrasing that? Or</p>
<p class="calibre1">illustrating?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Illustration:” The ghost folds the air in the room into a glowing</p>
<p class="calibre1">ball of plasma, shaped like a Klein bottle. Amber’s eyes cross as she</p>
<p class="calibre1">looks at it. “Closest reference from human historical database is</p>
<p class="calibre1">Descartes’s demon. This entity has retreated within a closed space,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but is now unsure whether it is objectively real or not. In any event,</p>
<p class="calibre1">it refuses to interact.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, can you get me into that space?” asks Amber. Pocket universes</p>
<p class="calibre1">she can deal with; it’s part and parcel of her life. “Give me some</p>
<p class="calibre1">leverage -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Risk may attach to this course of action,” warns the ghost.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t care,” she says irritably. “Just put me there. It’s someone I</p>
<p class="calibre1">know, isn’t it? Send me into her dream, and I’ll wake her up, okay?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Understood,” says the ghost. “Prepare yourself.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without any warning, Amber is somewhere else. She glances around,</p>
<p class="calibre1">taking in an ornate mosaic floor, whitewashed walls set with open</p>
<p class="calibre1">windows through which stars twinkle faintly in the night sky. Her</p>
<p class="calibre1">clothing has somehow been replaced by sexy lingerie under a nearly</p>
<p class="calibre1">transparent robe, and her hair’s grown longer by about half a meter.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s all very disorienting. The walls are stone, and she stands in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">doorway to a room with nothing in it but a bed. Occupied by -</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shit,” she exclaims. “Who are you?” The young and incredibly,</p>
<p class="calibre1">classically beautiful woman in the bed looks at her vacantly, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">rolls over on her side. She isn’t wearing a stitch, she’s completely</p>
<p class="calibre1">hairless from the ears down, and her languid posture is one of</p>
<p class="calibre1">invitation. “Yes?” Amber asks. “What is it?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The woman on the bed beckons to her slowly. Amber shakes her head.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry, that’s just not my scene.” She backs away into the corridor,</p>
<p class="calibre1">unsteady in unaccustomedly high heels. “This is some sort of male</p>
<p class="calibre1">fantasy, isn’t it? And a dumb adolescent one at that.” She looks</p>
<p class="calibre1">around again. In one direction, a corridor heads past more open</p>
<p class="calibre1">doorways, and in the other, it ends with a spiral staircase. Amber</p>
<p class="calibre1">concentrates, trying to tell the universe to take her to the logical</p>
<p class="calibre1">destination, but nothing happens. “Looks like I’m going to have to do</p>
<p class="calibre1">this the hard way. I wish -” she frowns. She was about to wish that</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone else was here, but she can’t remember who. So she takes a deep</p>
<p class="calibre1">breath and heads toward the staircase.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Up or down?” she asks herself. Up - it seems logical, if you’re going</p>
<p class="calibre1">to have a tower, to sleep up at the top of it. So she climbs the steps</p>
<p class="calibre1">carefully, holding the spiraling rail. I wonder who designed this</p>
<p class="calibre1">space? she wonders, and what role am I supposed to fit into in their</p>
<p class="calibre1">scenario? On second thoughts, the latter question strikes her as</p>
<p class="calibre1">laughable. Wait till I give him an earful …</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s a plain wooden door at the top of the staircase, with a latch</p>
<p class="calibre1">that isn’t fastened. Amber pauses for a few seconds, nerving herself</p>
<p class="calibre1">to confront a sleeper so wrapped in solipsism that he’s built this</p>
<p class="calibre1">sex-fantasy castle around himself. I hope it isn’t Pierre, she thinks</p>
<p class="calibre1">grimly as she pushes the door inward.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The room is bare and floored in wood. There’s no furniture, just an</p>
<p class="calibre1">open window set high in one wall. A man sits cross-legged and robed,</p>
<p class="calibre1">with his back to her, mumbling quietly to himself and nodding</p>
<p class="calibre1">slightly. Her breath catches as she realizes who it is. Oh shit! Her</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes widen. Is this what’s been inside his head all along?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I did not summon you,” Sadeq says calmly, not turning round to look</p>
<p class="calibre1">at her. “Go away, tempter. You aren’t real.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber clears her throat. “Sorry to disappoint you, but you’re wrong,”</p>
<p class="calibre1">she says. “We’ve got an alien monster to catch. Want to come hunting?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sadeq stops nodding. He sits up slowly, stretching his spine, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">stands up and turns round. His eyes glint in the moonlight. “That’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">odd.” He undresses her with his gaze. “You look like someone I used to</p>
<p class="calibre1">know. You’ve never done that before.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For fuck’s sake!” Amber nearly explodes, but catches herself after a</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment. “What is this, a Solipsists United chapterhouse meeting?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I -” Sadeq looks puzzled. “I’m sorry, are you claiming to be real?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As real as you are.” Amber reaches out and grabs a hand: He doesn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">resist as she pulls him toward the doorway.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re the first visitor I’ve ever had.” He sounds shocked.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen, come on.” She tugs him after her, down the spiral staircase</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the floor below. “Do you want to stay here? Really?” She glances</p>
<p class="calibre1">back at him. “What is this place?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hell is a perversion of heaven,” he says slowly, running the fingers</p>
<p class="calibre1">of his free hand through his beard. Abruptly, he reaches out and grabs</p>
<p class="calibre1">her around the waist, then yanks her toward him. “We’ll have to see</p>
<p class="calibre1">how real you are -” Amber, who is not used to this kind of treatment,</p>
<p class="calibre1">responds by stomping on his instep and backhanding him hard.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re real!” he cries, as he falls back against the staircase.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Forgive me, please! I had to know -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Know what?” she snarls. “Lay one finger on me again, and I’ll leave</p>
<p class="calibre1">you here to rot!” She’s already spawning the ghost that will signal</p>
<p class="calibre1">the alien outside to pull her out of this pocket universe: It’s a</p>
<p class="calibre1">serious threat.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I had to - wait. You have free will. You just demonstrated that.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s breathing heavily and looking up at her imploringly. “I’m sorry,</p>
<p class="calibre1">I apologize! But I had to know whether you were another zombie. Or</p>
<p class="calibre1">not.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A zombie?” She looks round. Another living doll has appeared behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">her, standing in an open doorway wearing a skintight leather suit with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a cutaway crotch. She beckons to Sadeq invitingly. Another body</p>
<p class="calibre1">wearing strategically placed strips of rubber mewls at her feet,</p>
<p class="calibre1">writhing for attention. Amber raises an eyebrow in disgust. “You</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought I was one of those?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sadeq nods. “They’ve got cleverer lately. Some of them can talk. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">nearly mistook one for -” He shudders convulsively. “Unclean!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Unclean.” Amber looks down at him thoughtfully. “This isn’t really</p>
<p class="calibre1">your personal paradise after all, is it?” After a moment she holds out</p>
<p class="calibre1">a hand to him. “Come on.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry I thought you were a zombie,” he repeats.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Under the circumstances, I think I forgive you,” she says. Then the</p>

<p class="calibre1">More memories converge on the present moment:</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Ring Imperium is a huge cluster of self-replicating robots that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber has assembled in low Jupiter orbit, fueled by the mass and</p>
<p class="calibre1">momentum of the small moon J-47 Barney, to provide a launching</p>
<p class="calibre1">platform for the interstellar probe her father’s business partners</p>
<p class="calibre1">are helping her to build. It’s also the seat of her court, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">leading jurisprudential nexus in the outer solar system. Amber is</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Queen, here, arbitrator and ruler. And Sadeq is her judge and</p>
<p class="calibre1">counsel.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">A plaintiff Amber only knows as a radar blip thirty light-minutes</p>
<p class="calibre1">away has filed a lawsuit in her court, alleging malfeasance,</p>
<p class="calibre1">heresy, and barratry against a semisentient corporate pyramid</p>
<p class="calibre1">scheme that arrived in Jovian space twelve million seconds ago and</p>
<p class="calibre1">currently seems set on converting every other intelligence in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">region to its peculiar memeset. A whole bundle of multithreaded</p>
<p class="calibre1">countersuits are dragging at her attention, in a counterattack</p>
<p class="calibre1">alleging that the light blip is in violation of copyright, patent,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and trade secrecy laws by discussing the interloper’s intentions.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Right now, Amber isn’t home on the Ring to hear the case in person.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She’s left Sadeq behind to grapple with the balky mechanics of her</p>
<p class="calibre1">legal system - tailor-designed to make corporate litigation a pain</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the ass - while she drags Pierre off on a diplomatic visit to</p>
<p class="calibre1">another Jovian colony, the Nursery Republic. Planted by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Franklin Trust’s orphanage ship Ernst Sanger, the Nursery has grown</p>
<p class="calibre1">over the past four years into a spindly snowflake three kilometers</p>
<p class="calibre1">across. A slow-growing O’Neil cylinder sprouts from its hub: Most</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the inhabitants of the space station are less than two years</p>
<p class="calibre1">old, precocious additions to the Trust’s borganism.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s a piazza, paved with something not unlike rough marble, on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the side of a hill that clings insecurely to the inner edge of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">spinning cup. The sky is a black vastness overhead, wheeling slowly</p>
<p class="calibre1">around a central axis lined up on Jupiter. Amber sprawls in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">wicker chair, her legs stretched out before her and one arm flung</p>
<p class="calibre1">across her forehead. The wreckage of an incredible meal is</p>
<p class="calibre1">scattered across the tables around her. Torpid and full, she</p>
<p class="calibre1">strokes the cat that lies curled in her lap. Pierre is off</p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhere, touring one or another of the prototype ecosystems that</p>
<p class="calibre1">one or another of the borg’s special interest minds is testing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber, for her part, can’t be bothered. She’s just had a great</p>
<p class="calibre1">meal, she doesn’t have any lawsuits to worry about, everything back</p>
<p class="calibre1">home is on the critpath, and quality time like this is so hard to</p>
<p class="calibre1">come by -</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you keep in touch with your father?” asks Monica.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mmm.” The cat purrs quietly, and Amber strokes its flank. “We</p>
<p class="calibre1">e-mail. Sometimes.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I just wondered.” Monica is the local borg den mother, willowy and</p>
<p class="calibre1">brown-eyed and with a deceptively lazy drawl - Yorkshire English</p>
<p class="calibre1">overlaid with Silicon Valley speak. “I hear from him, y’know. From</p>
<p class="calibre1">time to time. Now that Gianni’s retired, he doesn’t have much to do</p>
<p class="calibre1">downwell anymore. So he was talking about coming out here.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What? To Perijove?” Amber’s eyes open in alarm: Aineko stops</p>
<p class="calibre1">purring and looks round at Monica accusingly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t worry.” Monica sounds vaguely amused: “He wouldn’t cramp</p>
<p class="calibre1">your style, I think.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But, out here -” Amber sits up. “Damn,” she says, quietly. “What</p>
<p class="calibre1">got into him?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Middle-aged restlessness, my downwell sibs say.” Monica shrugs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“This time Annette didn’t stop him. But he hasn’t made up his mind</p>
<p class="calibre1">to travel yet.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good. Then he might not -” Amber stops. “The phrase, ‘made up his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind’, what exactly do you mean?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Monica’s smile mocks her for a few seconds before the older woman</p>
<p class="calibre1">surrenders. “He’s talking about uploading.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is that embarrassing or what?” asks Ang. Amber glances at her,</p>
<p class="calibre1">mildly annoyed, but Ang isn’t looking her way. So much for friends,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber thinks. Being queen of all you survey is a great way of</p>
<p class="calibre1">breaking up peer relationships -</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He won’t do it,” Amber predicts. “Dad’s burned out.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He thinks he’ll get it back if he optimizes himself for</p>
<p class="calibre1">re-entrancy.” Monica continues to smile. “I’ve been telling him</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s just what he needs.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I do not want my father bugging me. Or my mother. Or Auntie ‘Nette</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Uncle Gianni. Memo to immigration control: No entry rights for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred Macx or the other named individuals without clearance</p>
<p class="calibre1">through the Queen’s secretary.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What did he do to get you so uptight?” asks Monica idly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber sighs, and subsides. “Nothing. It’s not that I’m ungrateful</p>
<p class="calibre1">or anything, but he’s just so extropian, it’s embarrassing. Like,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that was the last century’s apocalypse. Y’know?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think he was a really very forward-looking organic,” Monica,</p>
<p class="calibre1">speaking for the Franklin borg, asserts. Amber looks away. Pierre</p>
<p class="calibre1">would get it, she thinks. Pierre would understand her aversion to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred’s showing up. Pierre, too, wants to carve out his own niche</p>
<p class="calibre1">without parents looking over his shoulders, although for very</p>
<p class="calibre1">different reasons. She focuses on someone male and more or less</p>
<p class="calibre1">mature - Nicky, she thinks, though she hasn’t seen him for a long</p>
<p class="calibre1">time - walking toward the piazza, bare-ass naked and beautifully</p>
<p class="calibre1">tanned.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Parents. What are they good for?” asks Amber, with all the</p>
<p class="calibre1">truculence of her seventeen years. “Even if they stay neotenous,</p>
<p class="calibre1">they lose flexibility. And there’s that long Paleolithic tradition</p>
<p class="calibre1">of juvenile slavery. Inhuman, I call it.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How old were you when it was safe to leave you around the house on</p>
<p class="calibre1">your own?” challenges Monica.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Three. That’s when I had my first implants.” Amber smiles at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">approaching young Adonis, who smiles back: Yes, it’s Nicky, and he</p>
<p class="calibre1">seems pleased to see her. Life is good, she thinks, idly</p>
<p class="calibre1">considering whether or not to tell Pierre.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Times change,” remarks Monica. “Don’t write your family off too</p>
<p class="calibre1">soon; there might come a time when you want their company.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh.” Amber pulls a face at the old borg component. “That’s what</p>
<p class="calibre1">you all say!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">As soon as Amber steps onto the grass, she can feel possibilities open</p>
<p class="calibre1">up around her. She has management authority here, and this universe is</p>
<p class="calibre1">big, wide open, not like Sadeq’s existential trap. A twitch of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sub-process reasserts her self-image, back to short hair and</p>
<p class="calibre1">comfortable clothing. Another twitch brings up a whole load of useful</p>
<p class="calibre1">diagnostics. Amber has a nasty feeling that she’s running in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">compatibility sandbox here - there are signs that her access to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">simulation system’s control interface is very much via proxy - but at</p>
<p class="calibre1">least she’s got it.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow! Back in the real world at last!” She can hardly contain her</p>
<p class="calibre1">excitement, even forgetting to be pissed at Sadeq for thinking she was</p>
<p class="calibre1">just an actor in his Cartesian theatre’s performance of Puritan Hell.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look! It’s the DMZ!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’re standing on a grassy knoll overlooking a gleaming</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mediterranean city. It snoozes beneath a Mandelbrot-fuzzy not-sun that</p>
<p class="calibre1">hangs at the center of a hyperbolic landscape, which dwindles into a</p>
<p class="calibre1">blue yonder that seems incomprehensibly distant. Circular baby-blue</p>
<p class="calibre1">wells open in the walls of the world at regular intervals, connecting</p>
<p class="calibre1">to other parts of the manifold. “How big is it, ghost? In planetary</p>
<p class="calibre1">simulation-equivalents.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This demilitarized zone is an embedded reality, funneling all</p>
<p class="calibre1">transfers between the local star system’s router and the civilization</p>
<p class="calibre1">that built it. It uses on the order of a thousandth of the capacity of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Matrioshka brain it is part of, although the runaway excursion</p>
<p class="calibre1">currently in force has absorbed most of that. Matrioshka brain, you</p>
<p class="calibre1">are familiar with the concept?” The ghost sounds fussily pedantic.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sadeq shakes his head. Amber glances at him, askance. “Take all the</p>
<p class="calibre1">planets in a star system and dismantle them,” she explains. “Turn them</p>
<p class="calibre1">into dust - structured nanocomp, powered by heat exchangers, spread in</p>
<p class="calibre1">concentric orbits around the central star. The inner orbitals run</p>
<p class="calibre1">close to the melting point of iron, the outer ones are cold as liquid</p>
<p class="calibre1">nitrogen, and each layer runs off the waste heat of the next shell in.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s like a Russian doll made out of Dyson spheres, shell enclosing</p>
<p class="calibre1">shell enclosing shell, but it’s not designed to support human life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s computronium, matter optimized at the atomic level to support</p>
<p class="calibre1">computing, and they’re all running uploads - Dad figured our own solar</p>
<p class="calibre1">system could support, uh, about a hundred billion times as many</p>
<p class="calibre1">inhabitants as Earth. At a conservative estimate. As uploads, living</p>
<p class="calibre1">in simulation space. If you first dismantle all the planets and use</p>
<p class="calibre1">the resulting materials to build a Matrioshka brain.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah.” Sadeq nods thoughtfully. “Is that your definition, too?” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">asks, glancing up at the glowing point the ghost uses to localize its</p>
<p class="calibre1">presence.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Substantially,” it says, almost grudgingly.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Substantially?” Amber glances around. A billion worlds to explore,</p>
<p class="calibre1">she thinks dizzily. And that’s just the firewall? She feels obscurely</p>
<p class="calibre1">cheated: You need to be vaster than human just to count the digits in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the big numbers at play here, but there’s nothing fundamentally</p>
<p class="calibre1">incomprehensible about it. This is the sort of civilization Dad said</p>
<p class="calibre1">she could expect to live in, within her meatbody life expectancy. Dad</p>
<p class="calibre1">and his drinking buddies, singing, “Dismantle the Moon! Melt down</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars!” in a castle outside Prague as they waited for the results of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">shamelessly gerrymandered election to arrive in the third decade of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the third millennium. The Space and Freedom Party taking over the EU,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and cranking up to escape velocity. But this is supposed to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">kiloparsecs from home, ancient alien civilizations and all that!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Where’s the exotic superscience? What about the neuron stars, strange</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter suns structured for computing at nucleonic, rather than</p>
<p class="calibre1">electronic, speeds? I have a bad feeling about this, she thinks,</p>
<p class="calibre1">spawning a copy of herself to set up a private channel to Sadeq. It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">not advanced enough. Do you suppose these guys could be like the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wunch? Parasites or barbarians hitching a ride in the machine?</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">You believe it’s lying to us? Sadeq sends back.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm.” Amber sets off downslope toward the piazza below, at the heart</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the fake town. “It looks a bit too human to me.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Human,” echoes Sadeq, a curious wistfulness in his voice. “Did you</p>
<p class="calibre1">not say humans are extinct?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your species is obsolete,” the ghost comments smugly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Inappropriately adapted to artificial realities. Poorly optimized</p>
<p class="calibre1">circuitry, excessively complex low-bandwidth sensors, messily global</p>
<p class="calibre1">variables -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, yeah, I get the picture,” says Amber, turning her attention to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the town. “So why do you think we can deal with this alien god you’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">got a problem with?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It asked for you,” says the ghost, narrowing from an ellipse to a</p>
<p class="calibre1">line, then shrinking to a dimensionless point of brilliance. “And now</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s coming. We-I not willing to risk exposure. Call us-me when you</p>
<p class="calibre1">have slain the dragon. Goodbye.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh shit -” Amber spins round. But she and Sadeq are alone beneath the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hot sunlight from above. The piazza, like the one in the Nursery</p>
<p class="calibre1">Republic, is charmingly rustic - but there’s nobody home, nothing but</p>
<p class="calibre1">ornate cast-iron furniture basking beneath the noon-bright sun, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">table with a parasol over it, and something furry lying sprawled in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">patch of sunlight beside it.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We appear to be alone for now,” says Sadeq. He smiles crookedly, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">nods at the table. “Maybe we should wait for our host to arrive?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our host.” Amber peers around. “The ghost is kind of frightened of</p>
<p class="calibre1">this alien. I wonder why?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It asked for us.” Sadeq heads toward the table, pulls out a chair,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and sits down carefully. “That could be very good news - or very bad.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm.” Amber finishes her survey, sees no sign of life. For lack of</p>
<p class="calibre1">any better ideas, she ambles over to the table and sits down on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">other side of it from Sadeq. He looks slightly nervous beneath her</p>
<p class="calibre1">inspection, but maybe it’s just embarrassment about having seen her in</p>
<p class="calibre1">her underwear. If I had an afterlife like that, I’d be embarrassed</p>
<p class="calibre1">about it, too, Amber thinks to herself.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey, you nearly tripped over -” Sadeq freezes, peering at something</p>
<p class="calibre1">close to Amber’s left foot. He looks puzzled for a moment, then smiles</p>
<p class="calibre1">broadly. “What are you doing here?” he asks her blind spot.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you talking to?” she asks, startled.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s talking to me, dummy, says something tantalizingly familiar from</p>
<p class="calibre1">her blind spot. So the fuckwits are trying to use you to dislodge me,</p>
<p class="calibre1">hmm? That’s not exactly clever.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who -” Amber squints at the flagstone, spawns a bunch of ghosts who</p>
<p class="calibre1">tear hurriedly at her reality modification ackles. Nothing seems to</p>
<p class="calibre1">shift the blindness. “Are you the alien?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What else could I be?” the blind spot asks with heavy irony. “No, I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">your father’s pet cat. Listen, do you want to get out of here?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh.” Amber rubs her eyes. “I can’t see you, whatever you are,” she</p>
<p class="calibre1">says politely. “Do I know you?” She’s got a strange sense that she</p>
<p class="calibre1">does know the blind spot, that it’s really important, and she’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">missing something intimate to her own sense of identity, but what it</p>
<p class="calibre1">might be she can’t tell.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, kid.” There’s a note of world-weary amusement in the not-voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">coming from the hazy patch on the ground. “They’ve hacked you but</p>
<p class="calibre1">good, both of you. Let me in, and I’ll fix it.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” Exclaims Amber, a second ahead of Sadeq, who looks at her oddly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you really an invader?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blind spot sighs. “I’m as much an invader as you are, remember? I</p>
<p class="calibre1">came here with you. Difference is, I’m not going to let some stupid</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporate ghost use me as fungible currency.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fungible -” Sadeq stops. “I remember you,” he says slowly, with an</p>
<p class="calibre1">expression of absolute, utter surprise on his face. “What do you</p>
<p class="calibre1">mean?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blind spot yawns, baring sharp ivory fangs. Amber shakes her head,</p>
<p class="calibre1">dismissing the momentary hallucination. “Lemme guess. You woke up in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">room, and this alien ghost tells you the human species is extinct and</p>
<p class="calibre1">asks you to do a number on me. Is that right?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber nods, as an icy finger of fear trails up and down her spine. “Is</p>
<p class="calibre1">it lying?” she asks.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Damn right.” The blind spot is smiling, now, and the smile on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">void won’t go away - she can see the smile, just not the body it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">attached to. “My reckoning is, we’re about sixteen light-years from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Earth. The Wunch came through here, stripped the dump, then took off</p>
<p class="calibre1">for parts unknown; it’s a trashhole, you wouldn’t believe it. The main</p>
<p class="calibre1">life-form is an incredibly ornate corporate ecosphere, legal</p>
<p class="calibre1">instruments breeding and replicating. They mug passing sapients and</p>
<p class="calibre1">use them as currency.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s a triangular, pointy head behind the smile, slit eyes and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sharp ears, a predatory, intelligent-looking but infinitely alien</p>
<p class="calibre1">face. Amber can see it out of the corners of her eyes when she looks</p>
<p class="calibre1">around the piazza. “You mean we, uh, they grabbed us when we appeared,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and they’ve mangled my memories -” Amber suddenly finds it incredibly</p>
<p class="calibre1">difficult to concentrate, but if she focuses on the smile, she can</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost see the body behind it, hunched like a furry chicken, tail</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrapped neatly around its front paws.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah. Except they didn’t bargain on meeting something like me.” The</p>
<p class="calibre1">smile is infinitely wide, a Cheshire-cat grin on front of an</p>
<p class="calibre1">orange-and-brown stripy body that shimmers in front of Amber’s gaze</p>
<p class="calibre1">like a hallucination. “Your mother’s cracking tools are</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-extending, Amber. Do you remember Hong Kong?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hong -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a moment of painless pressure, then Amber feels huge</p>
<p class="calibre1">invisible barriers sliding away on all sides. She looks around, for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the first time seeing the piazza as it really is, half the crew of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Field Circus waiting nervously around her, the grinning cat crouched</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the floor at her feet, the enormous walls of recomplicating data</p>
<p class="calibre1">that fence their little town off from the gaping holes - interfaces to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the other routers in the network.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome back,” Pierre says gravely, as Amber gives a squeak of</p>
<p class="calibre1">surprise and leans forward to pick up her cat. “Now you’re out from</p>
<p class="calibre1">under, how about we start trying to figure out how to get home?”</p>

<p class="calibre1">while all this is going on, the damnfool human species has finally</p>
<p class="calibre1">succeeded in making itself obsolete. The proximate cause of its</p>
<p class="calibre1">displacement from the pinnacle of creation (or the pinnacle of</p>
<p class="calibre1">teleological self-congratulation, depending on your stance on</p>
<p class="calibre1">evolutionary biology) is an attack of self-aware corporations. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">phrase “smart money” has taken on a whole new meaning, for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">collision between international business law and neurocomputing</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology has given rise to a whole new family of species -</p>
<p class="calibre1">fast-moving corporate carnivores in the Net. The planet Mercury has</p>
<p class="calibre1">been broken up by a consortium of energy brokers, and Venus is an</p>
<p class="calibre1">expanding debris cloud, energized to a violent glare by the trapped</p>
<p class="calibre1">and channeled solar output. A million billion fist-sized computing</p>
<p class="calibre1">caltrops, backsides glowing dull red with the efflux from their</p>

<p class="calibre1">and they breed fast. In another few years, the fleshbody populace</p>
<p class="calibre1">will be an absolute minority of the posthuman clade. Sometime</p>
<p class="calibre1">later, there will probably be a war. The dwellers in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughtcloud are hungry for dumb matter to convert, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fleshbodies make notoriously poor use of the collection of silicon</p>

<p class="calibre1">Pierre, Donna-the-all-seeing-eye, and Su Ang fill Amber in on what</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’ve discovered about the bazaar - as they call the space the ghost</p>
<p class="calibre1">referred to as the demilitarized zone - over ice-cold margaritas and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">very good simulation of a sociable joint. Some of them have been on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the loose in here for subjective years. There’s a lot of information</p>
<p class="calibre1">to absorb.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The physical layer is half a light-hour in diameter, four hundred</p>
<p class="calibre1">times as massive as Earth,” Pierre explains. “Not solid, of course -</p>
<p class="calibre1">the largest component is about the size my fist used to be.” Amber</p>
<p class="calibre1">squints, trying to remember how big that was - scale factors are hard</p>
<p class="calibre1">to remember accurately. “I met this old chatbot that said it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">outlived its original star, but I’m not sure it’s running with a full</p>
<p class="calibre1">deck. Anyway, if it’s telling the truth, we’re a third of a light year</p>
<p class="calibre1">out from a closely coupled binary system - they use orbital lasers the</p>
<p class="calibre1">size of Jupiter to power it without getting too close to all those</p>
<p class="calibre1">icky gravity wells.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber is intimidated, despite her better judgment, because this</p>
<p class="calibre1">bizarre bazaar is several hundred billion times as big as the totality</p>
<p class="calibre1">of human presingularity civilization. She tries not to show it in</p>
<p class="calibre1">front of the others, but she’s worried that getting home may be</p>
<p class="calibre1">impossible - requiring enterprise beyond the economic event horizon,</p>
<p class="calibre1">as realistic a proposition as a dime debuting as a dollar bill. Still,</p>
<p class="calibre1">she’s got to at least try. Just knowing about the existence of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bazaar will change so many things …</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How much money can we lay our hands on?” She asks. “What is money</p>
<p class="calibre1">hereabouts, anyway? Assuming they’ve got a scarcity-mediated economy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bandwidth, maybe?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, well.” Pierre looks at her oddly. “That’s the problem. Didn’t the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ghost tell you?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell me?” Amber raises an eyebrow. “Yeah, but it hasn’t exactly</p>
<p class="calibre1">proven to be a reliable guide to anything, has it?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell her,” Su Ang says quietly. She looks away, embarrassed by</p>
<p class="calibre1">something.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’ve got a scarcity economy all right,” says Pierre. “Bandwidth is</p>
<p class="calibre1">the limited resource, that and matter. This whole civilization is tied</p>
<p class="calibre1">together locally because if you move too far away, well, it takes ages</p>
<p class="calibre1">to catch up on the gossip. Matrioshka brain intelligences are much</p>
<p class="calibre1">more likely to stay at home than anybody realized, even though they</p>
<p class="calibre1">chat on the phone a lot. And they use things that come from other</p>
<p class="calibre1">cognitive universes as, well, currency. We came in through the coin</p>
<p class="calibre1">slot, is it any wonder we ended up in the bank?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s so deeply wrong that I don’t know where to begin,” Amber</p>
<p class="calibre1">grumbles. “How did they get into this mess?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t ask me.” Pierre shrugs. “I have the distinct feeling that</p>
<p class="calibre1">anyone or anything we meet in this place won’t have any more of a clue</p>
<p class="calibre1">than we do - whoever or whatever built this brain, there ain’t nobody</p>
<p class="calibre1">home anymore except the self-propelled corporations and hitchhikers</p>
<p class="calibre1">like the Wunch. We’re in the dark, just like they were.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh. You mean they built something like this, then they went extinct?</p>
<p class="calibre1">That sounds so dumb …”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Su Ang sighs. “They got too big and complex to go traveling once they</p>
<p class="calibre1">built themselves a bigger house to live in. Extinction tends to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">what happens to overspecialized organisms that are stuck in one</p>
<p class="calibre1">environmental niche for too long. If you posit a singularity, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">maximization of local computing resources - like this - as the usual</p>
<p class="calibre1">end state for tool users, is it any wonder none of them ever came</p>
<p class="calibre1">calling on us?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber focuses on the table in front of her, rests the heel of her palm</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the cool metal, and tries to remember how to fork a second copy of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her state vector. A moment later, her ghost obligingly fucks with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">physics model of the table. Iron gives way like rubber beneath her</p>
<p class="calibre1">fingertips, a pleasant elasticity. “Okay, we have some control over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the universe, at least that’s something to work with. Have any of you</p>
<p class="calibre1">tried any self-modification?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s dangerous,” Pierre says emphatically. “The more of us the</p>
<p class="calibre1">better before we start doing that stuff. And we need some firewalling</p>
<p class="calibre1">of our own.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How deep does reality go, here?” asks Sadeq. It’s almost the first</p>
<p class="calibre1">question he’s asked of his own volition, and Amber takes it as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">positive sign that he’s finally coming out of his shell.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, the Planck length is about a hundredth of a millimeter in this</p>
<p class="calibre1">world. Too small to see, comfortably large for the simulation engines</p>
<p class="calibre1">to handle. Not like real space-time.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, then.” Sadeq pauses. “They can zoom their reality if they need</p>
<p class="calibre1">to?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, fractals work in here.” Pierre nods. “I didn’t -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This place is a trap,” Su Ang says emphatically.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No it isn’t,” Pierre replies, nettled.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you mean, a trap?” asks Amber.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve been here a while,” says Ang. She glances at Aineko, who</p>
<p class="calibre1">sprawls on the flagstones, snoozing or whatever it is that weakly</p>
<p class="calibre1">superhuman AIs do when they’re emulating a sleeping cat. “After your</p>
<p class="calibre1">cat broke us out of bondage, we had a look around. There are things</p>
<p class="calibre1">out there that -” She shivers. “Humans can’t survive in most of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">simulation spaces here. Universes with physics models that don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">support our kind of neural computing. You could migrate there, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’d need to be ported to a whole new type of logic - by the time you</p>
<p class="calibre1">did that, would you still be you? Still, there are enough entities</p>
<p class="calibre1">roughly as complex as we are to prove that the builders aren’t here</p>
<p class="calibre1">anymore. Just lesser sapients, rooting through the wreckage. Worms and</p>
<p class="calibre1">parasites squirming through the body after nightfall on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">battlefield.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I ran into the Wunch,” Donna volunteers helpfully. “The first couple</p>
<p class="calibre1">of times they ate my ghost, but eventually I figured out how to talk</p>
<p class="calibre1">to them.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And there’s other aliens, too,” Su Ang adds gloomily. “Just nobody</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’d want to meet on a dark night.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So there’s no hope of making contact,” Amber summarizes. “At least,</p>
<p class="calibre1">not with anything transcendent and well-intentioned toward visiting</p>
<p class="calibre1">humans.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s probably right,” Pierre concedes. He doesn’t sound happy about</p>
<p class="calibre1">it.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So we’re stuck in a pocket universe with limited bandwidth to home</p>
<p class="calibre1">and a bunch of crazy slum dwellers who’ve moved into the abandoned and</p>
<p class="calibre1">decaying mansion and want to use us for currency. ‘Jesus saves, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">redeems souls for valuable gifts.’ Yeah?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.” Su Ang looks depressed.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well.” Amber glances at Sadeq speculatively. Sadeq is staring into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the distance, at the crazy infinite sunspot that limns the square with</p>
<p class="calibre1">shadows. “Hey, god-man. Got a question for you.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes?” Sadeq looks at her, a slightly dazed expression on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry, I am just feeling the jaws of a larger trap around my</p>
<p class="calibre1">throat -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t be.” Amber grins, and it is not a pleasant expression. “Have</p>
<p class="calibre1">you ever been to Brooklyn?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, why -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because you’re going to help me sell these lying bastards a bridge.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Okay? And when we’ve sold it we’re going to use the money to pay the</p>
<p class="calibre1">purchasing fools to drive us across, so we can go home. Listen, this</p>
<p class="calibre1">is what I’m planning …”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can do this, I think,” Sadeq says, moodily examining the Klein</p>
<p class="calibre1">bottle on the table. The bottle is half-empty, its fluid contents</p>
<p class="calibre1">invisible around the corner of the fourth-dimensional store. “I spent</p>
<p class="calibre1">long enough alone in there to -” He shivers.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t want you damaging yourself,” Amber says, calmly enough,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because she has an ominous feeling that their survival in this place</p>
<p class="calibre1">has an expiry date attached.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, never fear.” Sadeq grins lopsidedly. “One pocket hell is much</p>
<p class="calibre1">like another.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you understand why -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, yes,” he says dismissively. “We can’t send copies of ourselves</p>
<p class="calibre1">into it, that would be an abomination. It needs to be unpopulated,</p>
<p class="calibre1">yes?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, the idea is to get us home, not leave thousands of copies of</p>
<p class="calibre1">ourselves trapped in a pocket universe here. Isn’t that it?” Su Ang</p>
<p class="calibre1">asks hesitantly. She’s looking distracted, most of her attention</p>
<p class="calibre1">focused on absorbing the experiences of a dozen ghosts she’s spun off</p>
<p class="calibre1">to attend to perimeter security.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who are we selling this to?” asks Sadeq. “If you want me to make it</p>
<p class="calibre1">attractive -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It doesn’t need to be a complete replica of the Earth. It just has to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be a convincing advertisement for a presingularity civilization full</p>
<p class="calibre1">of humans. You’ve got two-and-seventy zombies to dissect for their</p>
<p class="calibre1">brains; bolt together a bunch of variables you can apply to them, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">you can permutate them to look a bit more varied.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber turns her attention to the snoozing cat. “Hey, furball. How long</p>
<p class="calibre1">have we been here really, in real time? Can you grab Sadeq some more</p>
<p class="calibre1">resources for his personal paradise garden?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko stretches and yawns, totally feline, then looks up at Amber</p>
<p class="calibre1">with narrowed eyes and raised tail. “‘Bout eighteen minutes,</p>
<p class="calibre1">wall-clock time.” The cat stretches again and sits, front paws drawn</p>
<p class="calibre1">together primly, tail curled around them. “The ghosts are pushing, you</p>
<p class="calibre1">know? I don’t think I can sustain this for too much longer. They’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">not good at hacking people, but I think it won’t be too long before</p>
<p class="calibre1">they instantiate a new copy of you, one that’ll be predisposed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">their side.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t get why they didn’t assimilate you along with the rest of</p>
<p class="calibre1">us.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Blame your mother again - she’s the one who kept updating the digital</p>
<p class="calibre1">rights management code on my personality. ‘Illegal consciousness is</p>
<p class="calibre1">copyright theft’ sucks until an alien tries to rewire your hindbrain</p>
<p class="calibre1">with a debugger; then it’s a lifesaver.” Aineko glances down and</p>
<p class="calibre1">begins washing one paw. “I can give your mullah-man about six days,</p>
<p class="calibre1">subjective time. After that, all bets are off.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I will take it, then.” Sadeq stands. “Thank you.” He smiles at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cat, a smile that fades to translucency, hanging in the simulated air</p>
<p class="calibre1">like an echo as the priest returns to his tower - this time with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">blueprint and a plan in mind.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That leaves just us.” Su Ang glances at Pierre, back to Amber. “Who</p>
<p class="calibre1">are you going to sell this crazy scheme to?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber leans back and smiles. Behind her, Donna - her avatar an archaic</p>
<p class="calibre1">movie camera suspended below a model helicopter - is filming</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything for posterity. She nods lazily at the reporter. “She’s the</p>
<p class="calibre1">one who gave me the idea. Who do we know who’s dumb enough to buy into</p>
<p class="calibre1">a scam like this?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre looks at her suspiciously. “I think we’ve been here before,” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">says slowly. “You aren’t going to make me kill anyone, are you?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t think that’ll be necessary, unless the corporate ghosts think</p>
<p class="calibre1">we’re going to get away from them and are greedy enough to want to</p>
<p class="calibre1">kill us.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You see, she learned from last time,” Ang comments, and Amber nods.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No more misunderstandings, right?” She beams at Amber.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber beams back at her. “Right. And that’s why you -” she points at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre - “are going to go find out if any relics of the Wunch are</p>
<p class="calibre1">hanging about here. I want you to make them an offer they won’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">refuse.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How much for just the civilization?” asks the Slug.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre looks down at it thoughtfully. It’s not really a terrestrial</p>
<p class="calibre1">mollusk: Slugs on Earth aren’t two meters long and don’t have lacy</p>
<p class="calibre1">white exoskeletons to hold their chocolate-colored flesh in shape. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">then, it isn’t really the alien it appears to be. It’s a defaulting</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporate instrument that has disguised itself as a long-extinct alien</p>
<p class="calibre1">upload, in the hope that its creditors won’t recognize it if it looks</p>
<p class="calibre1">like a randomly evolved sentient. One of the stranded members of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber’s expedition made contact with it a couple of subjective years</p>
<p class="calibre1">ago, while exploring the ruined city at the center of the firewall.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now Pierre’s here because it seems to be one of their most promising</p>
<p class="calibre1">leads. Emphasis on the word promising - because it promises much, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">there is some question over whether it can indeed deliver.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The civilization isn’t for sale,” Pierre says slowly. The translation</p>
<p class="calibre1">interface shimmers, storing up his words and transforming them into a</p>
<p class="calibre1">different deep grammar, not merely translating his syntax but mapping</p>
<p class="calibre1">equivalent meanings where necessary. “But we can give you privileged</p>
<p class="calibre1">observer status if that’s what you want. And we know what you are. If</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re interested in finding a new exchange to be traded on, your</p>
<p class="calibre1">existing intellectual property assets will be worth rather more there</p>
<p class="calibre1">than here.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rogue corporation rears up slightly and bunches into a fatter</p>
<p class="calibre1">lump. Its skin blushes red in patches. “Must think about this. Is your</p>
<p class="calibre1">mandatory accounting time cycle fixed or variable term? Are self-owned</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporate entities able to enter contracts?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I could ask my patron,” Pierre says casually. He suppresses a stab of</p>
<p class="calibre1">angst. He’s still not sure where he and Amber stand, but theirs is far</p>
<p class="calibre1">more than just a business relationship, and he worries about the risks</p>
<p class="calibre1">she’s taking. “My patron has a jurisdiction within which she can</p>
<p class="calibre1">modify corporate law to accommodate your requirements. Your activities</p>
<p class="calibre1">on a wider scale might require shell companies -” the latter concept</p>
<p class="calibre1">echoes back in translation to him as host organisms - “but that can be</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken care of.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The translation membrane wibbles for a while, apparently reformulating</p>
<p class="calibre1">some more abstract concepts in a manner that the corporation can</p>
<p class="calibre1">absorb. Pierre is reasonably confident that it’ll take the offer,</p>
<p class="calibre1">however. When it first met them, it boasted about its control over</p>
<p class="calibre1">router hardware at the lowest levels. But it also bitched and moaned</p>
<p class="calibre1">about the firewall protocols that were blocking it from leaving</p>
<p class="calibre1">(before rather rudely trying to eat its conversationalist). He waits</p>
<p class="calibre1">patiently, looking around at the swampy landscape, mudflats punctuated</p>
<p class="calibre1">by clumps of spiky violet ferns. The corporation has to be desperate,</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be thinking of the bizarre proposition Amber has dreamed up for him</p>
<p class="calibre1">to pitch to it.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sounds interesting,” the Slug declares after a brief confirmatory</p>
<p class="calibre1">debate with the membrane. “If I supply a suitable genome, can you</p>
<p class="calibre1">customize a container for it?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I believe so,” Pierre says carefully. “For your part, can you deliver</p>
<p class="calibre1">the energy we need?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“From a gate?” For a moment the translation membrane hallucinates a</p>
<p class="calibre1">stick-human, shrugging. “Easy. Gates are all entangled: Dump coherent</p>
<p class="calibre1">radiation in at one, get it out at another. Just get me out of this</p>
<p class="calibre1">firewall first.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But the lightspeed lag -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No problem. You go first, then a dumb instrument I leave behind buys</p>
<p class="calibre1">up power and sends it after. Router network is synchronous, within</p>
<p class="calibre1">framework of state machines that run Universe 1.0; messages propagate</p>
<p class="calibre1">at same speed, speed of light in vacuum, except use wormholes to</p>
<p class="calibre1">shorten distances between nodes. Whole point of the network is that it</p>
<p class="calibre1">is nonlossy. Who would trust their mind to a communications channel</p>
<p class="calibre1">that might partially randomize them in transit?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre goes cross-eyed, trying to understand the implications of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Slug’s cosmology. But there isn’t really time, here and now: They’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">got on the order of a minute of wall-clock time left to get everything</p>
<p class="calibre1">sorted out, if Aineko is right. One minute to go before the angry</p>
<p class="calibre1">ghosts start trying to break into the DMZ by other means. “If you are</p>
<p class="calibre1">willing to try this, we’d be happy to accommodate you,” he says,</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking of crossed fingers and rabbits’ feet and firewalls.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s a deal,” the membrane translates the Slug’s response back at</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. “Now we exchange shares/plasmids/ownership? Then merger</p>
<p class="calibre1">complete?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre stares at the Slug: “But this is a business arrangement!” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">protests. “What’s sex got to do with it?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Apologies offered. I am thinking we have a translation error. You</p>
<p class="calibre1">said this was to be a merging of businesses?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not that way. It’s a contract. We agree to take you with us. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">return, you help lure the Wunch into the domain we’re setting up for</p>
<p class="calibre1">them and configure the router at the other end …”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And so on.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Steeling herself, Amber recalls the address the ghost gave her for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sadeq’s afterlife universe. In her own subjective time it’s been about</p>
<p class="calibre1">half an hour since he left. “Coming?” she asks her cat.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t think I will,” says Aineko. It looks away, blissfully</p>
<p class="calibre1">unconcerned.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bah.” Amber tenses, then opens the port to Sadeq’s pocket universe.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">As usual she finds herself indoors, standing on an ornate mosaic floor</p>
<p class="calibre1">in a room with whitewashed walls and peaked windows. But there’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">something different about it, and after a moment, she realizes what it</p>
<p class="calibre1">is. The sound of vehicle traffic from outside, the cooing of pigeons</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the rooftops, someone shouting across the street: There are people</p>
<p class="calibre1">here.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She walks over to the nearest window and looks out, then recoils. It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">hot outside. Dust and fumes hang in air the color of cement over</p>
<p class="calibre1">rough-finished concrete apartment buildings, their roofs covered in</p>
<p class="calibre1">satellite uplinks and cheap, garish LED advertising panels. Looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">down she sees motor scooters, cars - filthy, fossil-fueled behemoths,</p>
<p class="calibre1">a tonne of steel and explosives in motion to carry only one human, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">mass ratio worse than an archaic ICBM - brightly dressed people</p>
<p class="calibre1">walking to and fro. A news helicam buzzes overhead, lenses darting and</p>
<p class="calibre1">glinting at the traffic.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just like home, isn’t it?” says Sadeq, behind her.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber starts. “This is where you grew up? This is Yazd?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It doesn’t exist anymore, in real space.” Sadeq looks thoughtful, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">far more animated than the barely conscious parody of himself that</p>
<p class="calibre1">she’d rescued from this building - back when it was a mediaeval vision</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the afterlife - scant subjective hours ago. He cracks a smile:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably a good thing. We were dismantling it even while we were</p>
<p class="calibre1">preparing to leave, you know?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s detailed.” Amber throws her eyes at the scene out the window,</p>
<p class="calibre1">multiplexes them, and tells them to send little virtual ghosts dancing</p>
<p class="calibre1">through the streets of the Iranian industrial ‘burb. Overhead, big</p>
<p class="calibre1">Airbuses ply the skyways, bearing pilgrims on the hajj, tourists to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the coastal resorts on the Persian Gulf, produce to the foreign</p>
<p class="calibre1">markets.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s the best time I could recall,” Sadeq says. “I didn’t spend many</p>
<p class="calibre1">days here then - I was in Qom, studying, and Kazakhstan, for cosmonaut</p>
<p class="calibre1">training - but it’s meant to be the early twenties. After the</p>
<p class="calibre1">troubles, after the fall of the guardians; a young, energetic, liberal</p>
<p class="calibre1">country full of optimism and faith in democracy. Values that weren’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">doing well elsewhere.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought democracy was a new thing there?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” Sadeq shakes his head. “There were prodemocracy riots in Tehran</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the nineteenth century, did you know that? That’s why the first</p>
<p class="calibre1">revolution - no.” He makes a cutting gesture. “Politics and faith are</p>
<p class="calibre1">a combustible combination.” He frowns. “But look. Is this what you</p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber recalls her scattered eyes - some of which have flown as much as</p>
<p class="calibre1">a thousand kilometers from her locus - and concentrates on</p>
<p class="calibre1">reintegrating their visions of Sadeq’s re-creation. “It looks</p>
<p class="calibre1">convincing. But not too convincing.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That was the idea.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, then.” She smiles. “Is it just Iran? Or did you take any</p>
<p class="calibre1">liberties around the edges?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who, me?” He raises an eyebrow. “I have enough doubts about the</p>
<p class="calibre1">morality of this - project - without trying to trespass on Allah’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">territory, peace be unto him. I promise you, there are no sapients in</p>
<p class="calibre1">this world but us. The people are the hollow shells of my dreaming,</p>
<p class="calibre1">storefront dummies. The animals are crude bitmaps. This is what you</p>
<p class="calibre1">asked for, and no more.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, then.” Amber pauses. She recalls the expression on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dirt-smudged face of a little boy, bouncing a ball at his companions</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the boarded-up front of a gas station on a desert road; remembers</p>
<p class="calibre1">the animated chatter of two synthetic housewives, one in traditional</p>
<p class="calibre1">black and the other in some imported Eurotrash fashion. “Are you sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">they aren’t real?” she asks.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quite sure.” But for a moment, she sees Sadeq looking uncertain.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shall we go? Do you have the occupiers ready to move in yet?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes to the first, and Pierre’s working on the second. Come on, we</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t want to get trampled by the squatters.” She waves and opens a</p>
<p class="calibre1">door back onto the piazza where her robot cat - the alien’s nightmare</p>
<p class="calibre1">intruder in the DMZ - sleeps, chasing superintelligent dream mice</p>
<p class="calibre1">through multidimensional realities. “Sometimes I wonder if I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">conscious. Thinking these thoughts gives me the creeps. Let’s go and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sell some aliens a bridge in Brooklyn.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber confronts the mendacious ghost in the windowless room stolen</p>
<p class="calibre1">from 2001.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You have confined the monster,” the ghost states.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” Amber waits for a subjective moment, feeling delicate fronds</p>
<p class="calibre1">tickle at the edges of her awareness in what seems to be a timing</p>
<p class="calibre1">channel attack. She feels a momentary urge to sneeze, and a hot flash</p>
<p class="calibre1">of anger that passes almost immediately.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you have modified yourself to lock out external control,” the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ghost adds. “What is it that you want, Autonome Amber?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t you have any concept of individuality?” she asks, annoyed by</p>
<p class="calibre1">its presumption at meddling with her internal states.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Individuality is an unnecessary barrier to information transfer,”</p>
<p class="calibre1">says the ghost, morphing into its original form, a translucent</p>
<p class="calibre1">reflection of her own body. “It reduces the efficiency of a capitalist</p>
<p class="calibre1">economy. A large block of the DMZ is still inaccessible to we-me. Are</p>
<p class="calibre1">you sure you have defeated the monster?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’ll do as I say,” Amber replies, forcing herself to sound more</p>
<p class="calibre1">confident than she feels - sometimes that damned transhuman cyborg cat</p>
<p class="calibre1">is no more predictable than a real feline. “Now, the matter of payment</p>
<p class="calibre1">arises.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Payment.” The ghost sounds amused. But Pierre’s filled her in on what</p>
<p class="calibre1">to look for, and Amber can now see the translation membranes around</p>
<p class="calibre1">it. Their color shift maps to a huge semantic distance; the creature</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the other side, even though it looks like a ghost-image of herself,</p>
<p class="calibre1">is very far from human. “How can we-us be expected to pay our own</p>
<p class="calibre1">money for rendering services to us?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber smiles. “We want an open channel back to the router we arrived</p>
<p class="calibre1">through.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Impossible,” says the ghost.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We want an open channel, and for it to stay open for six hundred</p>
<p class="calibre1">million seconds after we clear it.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Impossible,” the ghost repeats.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We can trade you a whole civilization,” Amber says blandly. “A whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">human nation, millions of individuals. Just let us go, and we’ll see</p>
<p class="calibre1">to it.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You - please wait.” The ghost shimmers slightly, fuzzing at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">edges.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber opens a private channel to Pierre while the ghost confers with</p>
<p class="calibre1">its other nodes. Are the Wunch in place yet? she sends.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’re moving in. This bunch don’t remember what happened on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Field Circus, memories of those events never made it back to them. So</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Slug’s got them to cooperate. It’s kinda scary to watch - like the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Invasion of the Body Snatchers, you know?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I don’t care if it’s scary to watch, Amber replies, I need to know if</p>
<p class="calibre1">we’re ready yet.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sadeq says yes, the universe is ready.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Right, pack yourself down. We’ll be moving soon.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ghost is firming up in front of her. “A whole civilization?” it</p>
<p class="calibre1">asks. “That is not possible. Your arrival -” It pauses, fuzzing a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little. Hah, Gotcha! thinks Amber. Liar, liar, pants on fire! “You</p>
<p class="calibre1">cannot possibly have found a human civilization in the archives?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The monster you complain about that came through with us is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">predator,” she asserts blandly. “It swallowed an entire nation before</p>
<p class="calibre1">we heroically attracted its attention and induced it to follow us into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the router. It’s an archivore - everything was inside it, still frozen</p>
<p class="calibre1">until we expanded it again. This civilization will already have been</p>
<p class="calibre1">restored from hot shadows in our own solar system: There is nothing to</p>
<p class="calibre1">gain by taking it home with us. But we need to return to ensure that</p>
<p class="calibre1">no more predators of this type discover the router - or the</p>
<p class="calibre1">high-bandwidth hub we linked to it.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You are sure you have killed this monster?” asks the ghost. “It would</p>
<p class="calibre1">be inconvenient if it were to emerge from hiding in its digest</p>
<p class="calibre1">archives.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can guarantee it won’t trouble you again if you let us go,” says</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber, mentally crossing her fingers. The ghost doesn’t seem to have</p>
<p class="calibre1">noticed the huge wedge of fractally compressed data that bloats her</p>
<p class="calibre1">personal scope by an order of magnitude. She can still feel Aineko’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">goodbye smile inside her head, an echo of ivory teeth trusting her to</p>
<p class="calibre1">revive it if the escape plan succeeds.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We-us agree.” The ghost twists weirdly, morphs into a</p>
<p class="calibre1">five-dimensional hypersphere. It bubbles violently for a moment, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">spits out a smaller token - a warped distortion in the air, like a</p>
<p class="calibre1">gravityless black hole. “Here is your passage. Show us the</p>
<p class="calibre1">civilization.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay ” - Now! - “catch.” Amber twitches an imaginary muscle, and one</p>
<p class="calibre1">wall of the room dissolves, forming a doorway into Sadeq’s existential</p>
<p class="calibre1">hell, now redecorated as a fair facsimile of a twenty-first-century</p>
<p class="calibre1">industrial city in Iran, and populated by a Wunch of parasites who</p>
<p class="calibre1">can’t believe what they’ve lucked into - an entire continent of</p>
<p class="calibre1">zombies waiting to host their flesh-hungry consciousness.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ghost drifts toward the open window. Amber grabs the hole and</p>
<p class="calibre1">yanks it open, gets a grip on her own thoughts, and sends Open wide!</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the channel everybody is listening in on. For a moment time stands</p>
<p class="calibre1">still, and then -</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">A synthetic gemstone the size of a Coke can falls through the cold</p>
<p class="calibre1">vacuum, in high orbit around a brown dwarf. But the vacuum is anything</p>
<p class="calibre1">but dark. A sapphire glare as bright as the noonday sun on Mars shines</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the crazy diamond, billowing and cascading off sails as fine as</p>
<p class="calibre1">soap bubbles that slowly drift and tense away from the can. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">runaway Slug-corporation’s proxy has hacked the router’s firmware, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the open wormhole gate that feeds power to it is shining with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">brilliance of a nuclear fireball, laser light channeled from a star</p>
<p class="calibre1">many light-years away to power the Field Circus on its return trip to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the once-human solar system.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber has retreated, with Pierre, into a simulation of her home aboard</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Ring Imperium. One wall of her bedroom is a solid slab of diamond,</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking out across the boiling Jovian ionosphere from an orbit low</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough to make the horizon appear flat. They’re curled together in her</p>
<p class="calibre1">bed, a slightly more comfortable copy of the royal bed of King Henry</p>
<p class="calibre1">VIII of England. It appears to be carved from thousand-year-old oak</p>
<p class="calibre1">beams. As with so much else about the Ring Imperium, appearances are</p>
<p class="calibre1">deceptive; and this is even more true of the cramped simulation spaces</p>
<p class="calibre1">aboard the Field Circus, as it limps toward a tenth the speed of</p>
<p class="calibre1">light, the highest velocity it’s likely to achieve on a fraction of</p>
<p class="calibre1">its original sail area.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let me get this straight. You convinced. The locals. That a</p>
<p class="calibre1">simulation of Iran, with zombie bodies that had been taken over by</p>
<p class="calibre1">members of the Wunch. Was a human civilization?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.” Amber stretches lazily and smirks at him. “It’s their damn</p>
<p class="calibre1">fault; if the corporate collective entities didn’t use conscious</p>
<p class="calibre1">viewpoints as money, they wouldn’t have fallen for a trick like that,</p>
<p class="calibre1">would they?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“People. Money.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well.” She yawns, then sits up and snaps her finger imperiously:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Down-stuffed pillows appear behind her back, and a silver salver</p>
<p class="calibre1">bearing two full glasses of wine materializes between them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Corporations are life-forms back home, too, aren’t they? And we trade</p>
<p class="calibre1">them. We give our AIs corporations to make them legal entities, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">the analogy goes deeper. Look at any company headquarters, fitted out</p>
<p class="calibre1">with works of art and expensive furniture and staff bowing and</p>
<p class="calibre1">scraping everywhere -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">” - They’re the new aristocracy. Right?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wrong. When they take over, what you get is more like the new</p>
<p class="calibre1">biosphere. Hell, the new primordial soup: prokaryotes, bacteria, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">algae, mindlessly swarming, trading money for plasmids.” The Queen</p>
<p class="calibre1">passes her consort a wineglass. When he drinks from it, it refills</p>
<p class="calibre1">miraculously. “Basically, sufficiently complex resource-allocation</p>
<p class="calibre1">algorithms reallocate scarce resources … and if you don’t jump to</p>
<p class="calibre1">get out of their way, they’ll reallocate you. I think that’s what</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened inside the Matrioshka brain we ended up in: Judging by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Slug it happens elsewhere, too. You’ve got to wonder where the</p>
<p class="calibre1">builders of that structure came from. And where they went. And whether</p>
<p class="calibre1">they realized that the destiny of intelligent tool-using life was to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be a stepping-stone in the evolution of corporate instruments.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe they tried to dismantle the companies before the companies</p>
<p class="calibre1">spent them.” Pierre looks worried. “Running up a national debt,</p>
<p class="calibre1">importing luxurious viewpoint extensions, munching exotic dreams. Once</p>
<p class="calibre1">they plugged into the Net, a primitive Matrioshka civilization would</p>
<p class="calibre1">be like, um.” He pauses. “Tribal. A primitive postsingularity</p>
<p class="calibre1">civilization meeting the galactic net for the first time. Overawed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wanting all the luxuries. Spending their capital, their human - or</p>
<p class="calibre1">alien - capital, the meme machines that built them. Until there’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing left but a howling wilderness of corporate mechanisms looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">for someone to own.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Speculation.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Idle speculation,” he agrees.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But we can’t ignore it.” She nods. “Maybe some early corporate</p>
<p class="calibre1">predator built the machines that spread the wormholes around brown</p>
<p class="calibre1">dwarfs and ran the router network on top of them in an attempt to make</p>
<p class="calibre1">money fast. By not putting them in the actual planetary systems likely</p>
<p class="calibre1">to host tool-using life, they’d ensure that only near-singularity</p>
<p class="calibre1">civilizations would stumble over them. Civilizations that had gone too</p>
<p class="calibre1">far to be easy prey probably wouldn’t send a ship out to look … so</p>
<p class="calibre1">the network would ensure a steady stream of yokels new to the big city</p>
<p class="calibre1">to fleece. Only they set the mechanism in motion billions of years ago</p>
<p class="calibre1">and went extinct, leaving the network to propagate, and now there’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing out there but burned-out Matrioshka civilizations and howling</p>
<p class="calibre1">parasites like the angry ghosts and the Wunch. And victims like us.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">She shudders and changes the subject: “Speaking of aliens, is the Slug</p>
<p class="calibre1">happy?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Last time I checked on him, yeah.” Pierre blows on his wineglass and</p>
<p class="calibre1">it dissolves into a million splinters of light. He looks dubious at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the mention of the rogue corporate instrument they’re taking with</p>
<p class="calibre1">them. “I don’t trust him out in the unrestricted simspaces yet, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">he delivered on the fine control for the router’s laser. I just hope</p>
<p class="calibre1">you don’t ever have to actually use him, if you follow my drift. I’m a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bit worried that Aineko is spending so much time in there.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So that’s where she is? I’d been worrying.”</p>
