<h2 id="calibre_toc_7" class="calibre3">Chapter 2: Troubadour</h2><p class="calibre1">Three years later, Manfred is on the run. His gray-eyed fate is in hot</p>
<p class="calibre1">pursuit, blundering after him through divorce court, chat room, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">meetings of the International Monetary Emergency Fund. It’s a merry</p>
<p class="calibre1">dance he leads her. But Manfred isn’t running away, he’s discovered a</p>
<p class="calibre1">mission. He’s going to make a stand against the laws of economics in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the ancient city of Rome. He’s going to mount a concert for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">spiritual machines. He’s going to set the companies free, and break</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Italian state government.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">In his shadow, his monster runs, keeping him company, never halting.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred re-enters Europe through an airport that’s all</p>
<p class="calibre1">twentieth-century chrome and ductwork, barbaric in its decaying</p>
<p class="calibre1">nuclear-age splendor. He breezes through customs and walks down a</p>
<p class="calibre1">long, echoing arrival hall, sampling the local media feeds. It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">November, and in a misplaced corporate search for seasonal cheer, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">proprietors have come up with a final solution to the Christmas</p>
<p class="calibre1">problem, a mass execution of plush Santas and elves. Bodies hang</p>
<p class="calibre1">limply overhead every few meters, feet occasionally twitching in</p>
<p class="calibre1">animatronic death, like a war crime perpetrated in a toy shop. Today’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">increasingly automated corporations don’t understand mortality,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred thinks, as he passes a mother herding along her upset</p>
<p class="calibre1">children. Their immortality is a drawback when dealing with the humans</p>
<p class="calibre1">they graze on: They lack insight into one of the main factors that</p>
<p class="calibre1">motivates the meat machines who feed them. Well, sooner or later we’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">have to do something about that, he tells himself.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The free media channels here are denser and more richly</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-referential than anything he’s seen in President Santorum’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">America. The accent’s different, though. Luton, London’s fourth</p>
<p class="calibre1">satellite airport, speaks with an annoyingly bumptious twang, like</p>
<p class="calibre1">Australian with a plum in its mouth. Hello, stranger! Is that a brain</p>
<p class="calibre1">in your pocket or are you just pleased to think me? Ping Watford</p>
<p class="calibre1">Informatics for the latest in cognitive modules and cheesy</p>
<p class="calibre1">motion-picture references. He turns the corner and finds himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">squeezed up against the wall between the baggage reclaim office and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">crowd of drunken Belgian tractor-drag fans, while his left goggle is</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying to urgently tell him something about the railway infrastructure</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Columbia. The fans wear blue face paint and chant something that</p>
<p class="calibre1">sounds ominously like the ancient British war cry, Wemberrrly,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wemberrrly, and they’re dragging a gigantic virtual tractor totem</p>
<p class="calibre1">through the webspace analogue of the arrivals hall. He takes the</p>
<p class="calibre1">reclaim office instead.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">As he enters the baggage reclaim zone, his jacket stiffens, and his</p>
<p class="calibre1">glasses dim: He can hear the lost souls of suitcases crying for their</p>
<p class="calibre1">owners. The eerie keening sets his own accessories on edge with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sense of loss, and for a moment, he’s so spooked that he nearly shuts</p>
<p class="calibre1">down the thalamic-limbic shunt interface that lets him feel their</p>
<p class="calibre1">emotions. He’s not in favor of emotions right now, not with the messy</p>
<p class="calibre1">divorce proceedings and the blood sacrifice Pam is trying to extract</p>
<p class="calibre1">from him; he’d much rather love and loss and hate had never been</p>
<p class="calibre1">invented. But he needs the maximum possible sensory bandwidth to keep</p>
<p class="calibre1">in touch with the world, so he feels it in his guts every time his</p>
<p class="calibre1">footwear takes a shine to some Moldovan pyramid scheme. Shut up, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">glyphs at his unruly herd of agents; I can’t even hear myself think!</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello, sir, have a nice day, how may I be of service?” the yellow</p>
<p class="calibre1">plastic suitcase on the counter says chirpily. It doesn’t fool</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred: He can see the Stalinist lines of control chaining it to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sinister, faceless cash register that lurks below the desk, agent of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the British Airport Authority corporate bureaucracy. But that’s okay.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Only bags need fear for their freedom in here.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just looking,” he mumbles. And it’s true. Because of a not entirely</p>
<p class="calibre1">accidental cryptographic routing feature embedded in an airline</p>
<p class="calibre1">reservations server, his suitcase is on its way to Mombasa, where it</p>
<p class="calibre1">will probably be pithed and resurrected in the service of some African</p>
<p class="calibre1">cyber-Fagin. That’s okay by Manfred - it only contains a statistically</p>
<p class="calibre1">normal mixture of second hand clothes and toiletries, and he only</p>
<p class="calibre1">carries it to convince the airline passenger-profiling expert systems</p>
<p class="calibre1">that he isn’t some sort of deviant or terrorist - but it leaves him</p>
<p class="calibre1">with a gap in his inventory that he must fill before he leaves the EU</p>
<p class="calibre1">zone. He needs to pick up a replacement suitcase so that he has as</p>
<p class="calibre1">much luggage leaving the superpower as he had when he entered it: He</p>
<p class="calibre1">doesn’t want to be accused of trafficking in physical goods in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">midst of the transatlantic trade war between new world protectionists</p>
<p class="calibre1">and old world globalists. At least, that’s his cover story - and he’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">sticking to it.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s a row of unclaimed bags in front of the counter, up for sale</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the absence of their owners. Some of them are very battered, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">among them is a rather good-quality suitcase with integral</p>
<p class="calibre1">induction-charged rollers and a keen sense of loyalty: exactly the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same model as his old one. He polls it and sees not just GPS, but a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Galileo tracker, a gazetteer the size of an old-time storage area</p>
<p class="calibre1">network, and an iron determination to follow its owner as far as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">gates of hell if necessary. Plus the right distinctive scratch on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lower left side of the case. “How much for just this one?” he asks the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bellwether on the desk.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ninety euros,” it says placidly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred sighs. “You can do better than that.” In the time it takes</p>
<p class="calibre1">them to settle on seventy-five, the Hang Sen Index is down</p>
<p class="calibre1">fourteen-point-one-six points, and what’s left of NASDAQ climbs</p>
<p class="calibre1">another two-point-one. “Deal.” Manfred spits some virtual cash at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">brutal face of the cash register, and it unfetters the suitcase,</p>
<p class="calibre1">unaware that Macx has paid a good bit more than seventy-five euros for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the privilege of collecting this piece of baggage. Manfred bends down</p>
<p class="calibre1">and faces the camera in its handle. “Manfred Macx,” he says quietly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Follow me.” He feels the handle heat up as it imprints on his</p>
<p class="calibre1">fingerprints, digital and phenotypic. Then he turns and walks out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the slave market, his new luggage rolling at his heels.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">A short train journey later, Manfred checks into a hotel in Milton</p>
<p class="calibre1">Keynes. He watches the sun set from his bedroom window, an occlusion</p>
<p class="calibre1">of concrete cows blocking the horizon. The room is functional in an</p>
<p class="calibre1">overly naturalistic kind of way, rattan and force-grown hardwood and</p>
<p class="calibre1">hemp rugs concealing the support systems and concrete walls behind. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">sits in a chair, gin and tonic at hand, absorbing the latest market</p>
<p class="calibre1">news and grazing his multichannel feeds in parallel. His reputation is</p>
<p class="calibre1">up two percent for no obvious reason today, he notices: Odd, that.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When he pokes at it he discovers that everybody’s reputation -</p>
<p class="calibre1">everybody, that is, who has a publicly traded reputation - is up a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bit. It’s as if the distributed Internet reputation servers are</p>
<p class="calibre1">feeling bullish about integrity. Maybe there’s a global honesty bubble</p>
<p class="calibre1">forming.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred frowns, then snaps his fingers. The suitcase rolls toward him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who do you belong to?” he asks.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Manfred Macx,” it replies, slightly bashfully.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, before me.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t understand that question.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He sighs. “Open up.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Latches whir and retract: The hard-shell lid rises toward him, and he</p>
<p class="calibre1">looks inside to confirm the contents.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The suitcase is full of noise.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Welcome to the early twenty-first century, human.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s night in Milton Keynes, sunrise in Hong Kong. Moore’s Law</p>
<p class="calibre1">rolls inexorably on, dragging humanity toward the uncertain future.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The planets of the solar system have a combined mass of</p>
<p class="calibre1">approximately 2 x 10^27 kilograms. Around the world, laboring women</p>

<p class="calibre1">of processing power. Also around the world, fab lines casually</p>
<p class="calibre1">churn out thirty million microprocessors a day, representing 10^23</p>
<p class="calibre1">MIPS. In another ten months, most of the MIPS being added to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">solar system will be machine-hosted for the first time. About ten</p>
<p class="calibre1">years after that, the solar system’s installed processing power</p>
<p class="calibre1">will nudge the critical 1 MIPS per gram threshold - one million</p>
<p class="calibre1">instructions per second per gram of matter. After that, singularity</p>
<p class="calibre1">- a vanishing point beyond which extrapolating progress becomes</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko curls on the pillow beside Manfred’s head, purring softly as</p>
<p class="calibre1">his owner dreams uneasily. The night outside is dark: Vehicles operate</p>
<p class="calibre1">on autopilot, running lights dipped to let the Milky Way shine down</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon the sleeping city. Their quiet, fuel-cell-powered engines do not</p>
<p class="calibre1">trouble Manfred’s sleep. The robot cat keeps sleepless watch, alert</p>
<p class="calibre1">for intruders, but there are none, save the whispering ghosts of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred’s metacortex, feeding his dreams with their state vectors.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The metacortex - a distributed cloud of software agents that surrounds</p>
<p class="calibre1">him in netspace, borrowing CPU cycles from convenient processors (such</p>
<p class="calibre1">as his robot pet) - is as much a part of Manfred as the society of</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind that occupies his skull; his thoughts migrate into it, spawning</p>
<p class="calibre1">new agents to research new experiences, and at night, they return to</p>
<p class="calibre1">roost and share their knowledge.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Manfred sleeps, he dreams of an alchemical marriage. She waits</p>
<p class="calibre1">for him at the altar in a strapless black gown, the surgical</p>
<p class="calibre1">instruments gleaming in her gloved hands. “This won’t hurt a bit,” she</p>
<p class="calibre1">explains as she adjusts the straps. “I only want your genome - the</p>
<p class="calibre1">extended phenotype can wait until … later.” Blood-red lips, licked:</p>
<p class="calibre1">a kiss of steel, then she presents the income tax bill.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s nothing accidental about this dream. As he experiences it,</p>
<p class="calibre1">microelectrodes in his hypothalamus trigger sensitive neurons.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Revulsion and shame flood him at the sight of her face, the sense of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his vulnerability. Manfred’s metacortex, in order to facilitate his</p>
<p class="calibre1">divorce, is trying to decondition his strange love. It has been</p>
<p class="calibre1">working on him for weeks, but still he craves her whiplash touch, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">humiliation of his wife’s control, the sense of helpless rage at her</p>
<p class="calibre1">unpayable taxes, demanded with interest.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko watches him from the pillow, purring continuously. Retractable</p>
<p class="calibre1">claws knead the bedding, first one paw, then the next. Aineko is full</p>
<p class="calibre1">of ancient feline wisdom that Pamela installed back when mistress and</p>
<p class="calibre1">master were exchanging data and bodily fluids rather than legal</p>
<p class="calibre1">documents. Aineko is more cat than robot, these days, thanks in part</p>
<p class="calibre1">to her hobbyist’s interest in feline neuroanatomy. Aineko knows that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred is experiencing nameless neurasthenic agonies, but really</p>
<p class="calibre1">doesn’t give a shit about that as long as the power supply is clean</p>
<p class="calibre1">and there are no intruders.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko curls up and joins Manfred in sleep, dreaming of laser-guided</p>
<p class="calibre1">mice.</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred is jolted awake by the hotel room phone shrilling for</p>
<p class="calibre1">attention.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello?” he asks, fuzzily.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Manfred Macx?” It’s a human voice, with a gravelly east coast accent.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah?” Manfred struggles to sit up. His mouth feels like the inside</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a tomb, and his eyes don’t want to open.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My name is Alan Glashwiecz, of Smoot, Sedgwick Associates. Am I</p>
<p class="calibre1">correct in thinking that you are the Manfred Macx who is a director of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a company called, uh, agalmic dot holdings dot root dot one-eight-four</p>
<p class="calibre1">dot ninety-seven dot A-for-able dot B-for-baker dot five,</p>
<p class="calibre1">incorporated?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh.” Manfred blinks and rubs his eyes. “Hold on a moment.” When the</p>
<p class="calibre1">retinal patterns fade, he pulls on his glasses and powers them up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just a second now.” Browsers and menus ricochet through his</p>
<p class="calibre1">sleep-laden eyes. “Can you repeat the company name?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure.” Glashwiecz repeats himself patiently. He sounds as tired as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred feels.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um.” Manfred finds it, floating three tiers down an elaborate object</p>
<p class="calibre1">hierarchy. It’s flashing for attention. There’s a priority interrupt,</p>
<p class="calibre1">an incoming lawsuit that hasn’t propagated up the inheritance tree</p>
<p class="calibre1">yet. He prods at the object with a property browser. “I’m afraid I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">not a director of that company, Mr. Glashwiecz. I appear to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">retained by it as a technical contractor with non-executive power,</p>
<p class="calibre1">reporting to the president, but frankly, this is the first time I’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever heard of the company. However, I can tell you who’s in charge if</p>
<p class="calibre1">you want.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes?” The attorney sounds almost interested. Manfred figures it out;</p>
<p class="calibre1">the guy’s in New Jersey, it must be about three in the morning over</p>
<p class="calibre1">there.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Malice - revenge for waking him up - sharpens Manfred’s voice. “The</p>
<p class="calibre1">president of agalmic.holdings.root.184.97.AB5 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">agalmic.holdings.root.184.97.201. The secretary is</p>
<p class="calibre1">agalmic.holdings.root.184.D5, and the chair is</p>
<p class="calibre1">agalmic.holdings.root.184.E8.FF. All the shares are owned by those</p>
<p class="calibre1">companies in equal measure, and I can tell you that their regulations</p>
<p class="calibre1">are written in Python. Have a nice day, now!” He thumps the bedside</p>
<p class="calibre1">phone control and sits up, yawning, then pushes the do-not-disturb</p>
<p class="calibre1">button before it can interrupt again. After a moment he stands up and</p>
<p class="calibre1">stretches, then heads to the bathroom to brush his teeth, comb his</p>
<p class="calibre1">hair, and figure out where the lawsuit originated and how a human</p>
<p class="calibre1">being managed to get far enough through his web of robot companies to</p>
<p class="calibre1">bug him.</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">While he’s having breakfast in the hotel restaurant, Manfred decides</p>
<p class="calibre1">that he’s going to do something unusual for a change: He’s going to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make himself temporarily rich. This is a change because Manfred’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">normal profession is making other people rich. Manfred doesn’t believe</p>
<p class="calibre1">in scarcity or zero-sum games or competition - his world is too fast</p>
<p class="calibre1">and information-dense to accommodate primate hierarchy games. However,</p>
<p class="calibre1">his current situation calls for him to do something radical: something</p>
<p class="calibre1">like making himself a temporary billionaire so he can blow off his</p>
<p class="calibre1">divorce settlement in an instant, like a wily accountancy octopus</p>
<p class="calibre1">escaping a predator by vanishing in a cloud of his own black ink.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pam is chasing him partially for ideological reasons - she still</p>
<p class="calibre1">hasn’t given up on the idea of government as the dominant</p>
<p class="calibre1">superorganism of the age - but also because she loves him in her own</p>
<p class="calibre1">peculiar way, and the last thing any self-respecting dom can tolerate</p>
<p class="calibre1">is rejection by her slave. Pam is a born-again postconservative, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">member of the first generation to grow up after the end of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">American century. Driven by the need to fix the decaying federal</p>
<p class="calibre1">system before it collapses under a mound of Medicare bills, overseas</p>
<p class="calibre1">adventurism, and decaying infrastructure, she’s willing to use</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-denial, entrapment, predatory mercantilism, dirty tricks, and any</p>
<p class="calibre1">other tool that boosts the bottom line. She doesn’t approve of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred’s jetting around the world on free airline passes, making</p>
<p class="calibre1">strangers rich, somehow never needing money. She can see his listing</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the reputation servers, hovering about thirty points above IBM: All</p>
<p class="calibre1">the metrics of integrity, effectiveness and goodwill value him above</p>
<p class="calibre1">even that most fundamentalist of open-source computer companies. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">she knows he craves her tough love, wants to give himself to her</p>
<p class="calibre1">completely. So why is he running away?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The reason he’s running away is entirely more ordinary. Their unborn</p>
<p class="calibre1">daughter, frozen in liquid nitrogen, is an unimplanted 96-hour-old</p>
<p class="calibre1">blastula. Pam’s bought into the whole Parents for Traditional Children</p>
<p class="calibre1">parasite meme. PTC are germ-line recombination refuseniks: They refuse</p>
<p class="calibre1">to have their children screened for fixable errors. If there’s one</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing that Manfred really can’t cope with, it’s the idea that nature</p>
<p class="calibre1">knows best - even though that isn’t the point she’s making. One</p>
<p class="calibre1">steaming row too many, and he kicked back, off to traveling fast and</p>
<p class="calibre1">footloose again, spinning off new ideas like a memetic dynamo and</p>
<p class="calibre1">living on the largesse of the new paradigm. File for divorce on</p>
<p class="calibre1">grounds of irreconcilable ideological differences. No more</p>

<p class="calibre1">for events like this. Its emptiness is a sign of the times, ubiquitous</p>
<p class="calibre1">broadband and expensive gas. (The robotized warehouse next door is, in</p>
<p class="calibre1">contrast, frenetically busy, packing parcels for home delivery.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether they telecommute or herd in meatspace offices, people still</p>
<p class="calibre1">need to eat.)</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today, the food hall is full of people. Eldritch ersatz insects buzz</p>
<p class="calibre1">menacingly along the shining empty meat counters without fear of</p>
<p class="calibre1">electrocution. Big monitors unfurled above the deli display cabinets</p>
<p class="calibre1">show a weird, jerky view of a three-dimensional nightmare, painted all</p>
<p class="calibre1">the synthetic colors of radar. The feminine-hygiene galley has been</p>
<p class="calibre1">wheeled back to make room for a gigantic plastic-shrouded tampon five</p>
<p class="calibre1">meters long and sixty centimeters in diameter - a microsat launcher</p>
<p class="calibre1">and conference display, plonked there by the show’s sponsors in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">transparent attempt to talent-spot the up-and-coming engineering</p>
<p class="calibre1">geeks.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred’s glasses zoom in and grab a particularly fetching Fokker</p>
<p class="calibre1">triplane that buzzes at face height through the crowd: He pipes the</p>
<p class="calibre1">image stream up to one of his websites in real time. The Fokker pulls</p>
<p class="calibre1">up in a tight Immelman turn beneath the dust-shrouded pneumatic cash</p>
<p class="calibre1">tubes that line the ceiling, then picks up the trail of an F-104G.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cold War Luftwaffe and Great War Luftwaffe dart across the sky in an</p>
<p class="calibre1">intricate game of tag. Manfred’s so busy tracking the warbirds that he</p>
<p class="calibre1">nearly trips over the fat white tube’s launcher-erector.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eh, Manfred! More care, s’il vous plait!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He wipes the planes and glances round. “Do I know you?” he asks</p>
<p class="calibre1">politely, even as he feels a shock of recognition.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Amsterdam, three years ago.” The woman in the double-breasted suit</p>
<p class="calibre1">raises an eyebrow at him, and his social secretary remembers her for</p>
<p class="calibre1">him, whispers in his ear.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Annette from Arianespace marketing?” She nods, and he focuses on her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Still dressing in the last-century retro mode that confused him the</p>
<p class="calibre1">first time they met, she looks like a Kennedy-era Secret Service man:</p>
<p class="calibre1">cropped bleached crew cut like an angry albino hedgehog, pale blue</p>
<p class="calibre1">contact lenses, black tie, narrow lapels. Only her skin color hints at</p>
<p class="calibre1">her Berber ancestry. Her earrings are cameras, endlessly watching. Her</p>
<p class="calibre1">raised eyebrow turns into a lopsided smile as she sees his reaction.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I remember. That cafe in Amsterdam. What brings you here?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why “- her wave takes in the entirety of the show - “this talent</p>
<p class="calibre1">show, of course.” An elegant shrug and a wave at the orbit-capable</p>
<p class="calibre1">tampon. “It’s good talent. We’re hiring this year. If we re-enter the</p>
<p class="calibre1">launcher market, we must employ only the best. Amateurs, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">time-servers, engineers who can match the very best Singapore can</p>
<p class="calibre1">offer.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the first time, Manfred notices the discreet corporate logo on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">flank of the booster. “You outsourced your launch-vehicle</p>
<p class="calibre1">fabrication?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette pulls a face as she explains with forced casualness: “Space</p>
<p class="calibre1">hotels were more profitable, this past decade. The high-ups, they</p>
<p class="calibre1">cannot be bothered with the rocketry, no? Things that go fast and</p>
<p class="calibre1">explode, they are pass�, they say. Diversify, they say. Until -” She</p>
<p class="calibre1">gives a very Gallic shrug. Manfred nods; her earrings are recording</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything she says, for the purposes of due diligence.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m glad to see Europe re-entering the launcher business,” he says</p>
<p class="calibre1">seriously. “It’s going to be very important when the nanosystems</p>
<p class="calibre1">conformational replication business gets going for real. A major</p>
<p class="calibre1">strategic asset to any corporate entity in the field, even a hotel</p>
<p class="calibre1">chain.” Especially now they’ve wound up NASA and the moon race is down</p>
<p class="calibre1">to China and India, he thinks sourly.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her laugh sounds like glass bells chiming. “And yourself, mon cher?</p>
<p class="calibre1">What brings you to the Confedera�ion? You must have a deal in mind.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well., it’s Manfred’s turn to shrug, “I was hoping to find a CIA</p>
<p class="calibre1">agent, but there don’t seem to be any here today.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That is not surprising,” Annette says resentfully. “The CIA thinks</p>
<p class="calibre1">the space industry, she is dead. Fools!” She continues for a minute,</p>
<p class="calibre1">enumerating the many shortcomings of the Central Intelligence Agency</p>
<p class="calibre1">with vigor and a distinctly Parisian rudeness. “They are become almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">as bad as AP and Reuters since they go public,” she adds. “All these</p>
<p class="calibre1">wire services! And they are, ah, stingy. The CIA does not understand</p>
<p class="calibre1">that good news must be paid for at market rates if freelance stringers</p>
<p class="calibre1">are to survive. They are to be laughed at. It is so easy to plant</p>
<p class="calibre1">disinformation on them, almost as easy as the Office of Special</p>
<p class="calibre1">Plans…” She makes a banknote-riffling gesture between fingers and</p>
<p class="calibre1">thumb. By way of punctuation, a remarkably maneuverable miniature</p>
<p class="calibre1">ornithopter swoops around her head, does a double-back flip, and dives</p>
<p class="calibre1">off in the direction of the liquor display.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">An Iranian woman wearing a backless leather minidress and a nearly</p>
<p class="calibre1">transparent scarf barges up and demands to know how much the</p>
<p class="calibre1">microbooster costs to buy: She is dissatisfied with Annette’s attempt</p>
<p class="calibre1">to direct her to the manufacturer’s website, and Annette looks</p>
<p class="calibre1">distinctly flustered by the time the woman’s boyfriend - a dashing</p>
<p class="calibre1">young air force pilot - shows up to escort her away. “Tourists,” she</p>
<p class="calibre1">mutters, before noticing Manfred, who is staring off into space with</p>
<p class="calibre1">fingers twitching. “Manfred?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh - what?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have been on this shop floor for six hours, and my feet, they kill</p>
<p class="calibre1">me.” She takes hold of his left arm and very deliberately unhooks her</p>
<p class="calibre1">earrings, turning them off. “If I say to you I can write for the CIA</p>
<p class="calibre1">wire service, will you take me to a restaurant and buy me dinner and</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell me what it is you want to say?”</p>

<p class="calibre1">Manfred and Annette eat on the top deck of the buffet car, chatting as</p>
<p class="calibre1">their TGV barrels through a tunnel under the English Channel. Annette,</p>
<p class="calibre1">it transpires, has been commuting daily from Paris; which was, in any</p>
<p class="calibre1">case, Manfred’s next destination. From the show, he messaged Aineko to</p>
<p class="calibre1">round up his baggage and meet him at St. Pancras Station, in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">terminal like the shell of a giant steel woodlouse. Annette left her</p>
<p class="calibre1">space launcher in the supermarket overnight: an unfueled test article,</p>
<p class="calibre1">it is of no security significance.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The railway buffet car is run by a Nepalese fast-food franchise. “I</p>
<p class="calibre1">sometimes wish for to stay on the train,” Annette says as she waits</p>
<p class="calibre1">for her mismas bhat. “Past Paris! Think. Settle back in your</p>
<p class="calibre1">couchette, to awaken in Moscow and change trains. All the way to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Vladivostok in two days.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If they let you through the border,” Manfred mutters. Russia is one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of those places that still requires passports and asks if you are now</p>
<p class="calibre1">or ever have been an anti-anticommunist: It’s still trapped by its</p>
<p class="calibre1">bloody-handed history. (Rewind the video stream to Stolypin’s necktie</p>
<p class="calibre1">party and start out fresh.) Besides, they have enemies: White Russian</p>
<p class="calibre1">oligarchs, protection racketeers in the intellectual property</p>
<p class="calibre1">business. Psychotic relics of the last decade’s experiment with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Marxism-Objectivism. “Are you really a CIA stringer?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette grins, her lips disconcertingly red: “I file dispatches from</p>
<p class="calibre1">time to time. Nothing that could get me fired.”</p>

<p class="calibre1">Manfred nods. “My wife has access to their unfiltered stream.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your -” Annette pauses. “It was she who I, I met? In De Wildemann’s?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">She sees his expression. “Oh, my poor fool!” She raises her glass to</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. “It is, has, not gone well?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred sighs and raises a toast toward Annette. “You know your</p>

<p class="calibre1">CIA, and she communicates using the IRS.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In only five years.” Annette winces. “You will pardon me for saying</p>
<p class="calibre1">this - she did not look like your type.” There’s a question hidden</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind that statement, and he notices again how good she is at</p>
<p class="calibre1">overloading her statements with subtexts.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not sure what my type is,” he says, half-truthfully. He can’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">elude the sense that something not of either of their doing went wrong</p>
<p class="calibre1">between him and Pamela, a subtle intrusion that levered them apart by</p>
<p class="calibre1">stealth. Maybe it was me, he thinks. Sometimes he isn’t certain he’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">still human; too many threads of his consciousness seem to live</p>
<p class="calibre1">outside his head, reporting back whenever they find something</p>
<p class="calibre1">interesting. Sometimes he feels like a puppet, and that frightens him</p>
<p class="calibre1">because it’s one of the early-warning signs of schizophrenia. And it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">too early for anyone out there to be trying to hack exocortices …</p>
<p class="calibre1">isn’t it? Right now, the external threads of his consciousness are</p>
<p class="calibre1">telling him that they like Annette, when she’s being herself instead</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a cog in the meatspace ensemble of Arianespace management. But the</p>
<p class="calibre1">part of him that’s still human isn’t sure just how far to trust</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself. “I want to be me. What do you want to be?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She shrugs, as a waiter slides a plate in front of her. “I’m just a, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Parisian babe, no? An ing�nue raised in the lilac age of le</p>
<p class="calibre1">Confedera�ion Europ�, the self-deconstructed ruins of the gilded</p>
<p class="calibre1">European Union.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, right.” A plate appears in front of Manfred. “And I’m a good</p>
<p class="calibre1">old microboomer from the MassPike corridor.” He peels back a corner of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the omelet topping and inspects the food underneath it. “Born in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sunset years of the American century.” He pokes at one of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">unidentifiable meaty lumps in the fried rice with his fork, and it</p>
<p class="calibre1">pokes right back. There’s a limit to how much his agents can tell him</p>
<p class="calibre1">about her - European privacy laws are draconian by American standards</p>
<p class="calibre1">- but he knows the essentials. Two parents who are still together,</p>
<p class="calibre1">father a petty politician in some town council down in the vicinity of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Toulouse. Went to the right �cole. The obligatory year spent bumming</p>
<p class="calibre1">around the Confedera�ion at government expense, learning how other</p>
<p class="calibre1">people live - a new kind of empire building, in place of the 20th</p>
<p class="calibre1">century’s conscription and jackboot wanderjahr. No weblog or personal</p>
<p class="calibre1">site that his agents can find. She joined Arianespace right out of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Polytechnique and has been management track ever since: Korou,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manhattan Island, Paris. “You’ve never been married, I take it.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She chuckles. “Time is too short! I am still young.” She picks up a</p>
<p class="calibre1">forkful of food, and adds quietly. “Besides, the government would</p>
<p class="calibre1">insist on paying.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah.” Manfred tucks into his bowl thoughtfully. With the birth rate</p>
<p class="calibre1">declining across Europe, the EC bureaucracy is worried; the old EU</p>
<p class="calibre1">started subsidizing babies, a new generation of carers, a decade ago,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and it still hasn’t dented the problem. All it’s done is alienate the</p>
<p class="calibre1">brightest women of childbearing age. Soon they’ll have to look to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">east for a solution, importing a new generation of citizens - unless</p>
<p class="calibre1">the long-promised aging hacks prove workable, or cheap AI comes along.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you have a hotel?” Annette asks suddenly.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In Paris?” Manfred is startled: “Not yet.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You must come home with me, then.” She looks at him quizzically.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Traditional Children and the dimensionality of confidence variation on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the reputation exchanges - then head for Rome. Instead, Annette drags</p>
<p class="calibre1">him back to her apartment, a large studio flat tucked away behind an</p>
<p class="calibre1">alley in the Marais. She sits him at the breakfast bar while she</p>
<p class="calibre1">tidies away his luggage, then makes him close his eyes and swallow two</p>
<p class="calibre1">dubious-tasting capsules. Next, she pours them each a tall glass of</p>
<p class="calibre1">freezing-cold Aqvavit that tastes exactly like Polish rye bread. When</p>
<p class="calibre1">they finish it, she just about rips his clothes off. Manfred is</p>
<p class="calibre1">startled to discover that he has a crowbar-stiff erection; since the</p>
<p class="calibre1">last blazing row with Pamela, he’d vaguely assumed he was no longer</p>
<p class="calibre1">interested in sex. Instead, they end up naked on the sofa, surrounded</p>
<p class="calibre1">by discarded clothing - Annette is very conservative, preferring the</p>
<p class="calibre1">naked penetrative fuck of the last century to the more sophisticated</p>
<p class="calibre1">fetishes of the present day.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Afterward, he’s even more surprised to discover that he’s still</p>
<p class="calibre1">tumescent. “The capsules?” he asks.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She sprawls a well-muscled but thin thigh across him, then reaches</p>
<p class="calibre1">down to grab his penis. Squeezes it. “Yes,” she admits. “You need much</p>
<p class="calibre1">special help to unwind, I think.” Another squeeze. “Crystal meth and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">traditional phosphodiesterase inhibitor.” He grabs one of her small</p>
<p class="calibre1">breasts, feeling very brutish and primitive. Naked. He’s not sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pamela ever let him see her fully naked: She thought skin was more</p>
<p class="calibre1">sexy when it was covered. Annette squeezes him again, and he stiffens.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“More!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">By the time they finish, he’s aching, and she shows him how to use the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bidet. Everything is crystal clear, and her touch is electrifying.</p>
<p class="calibre1">While she showers, he sits on the toilet seat lid and rants about</p>
<p class="calibre1">Turing-completeness as an attribute of company law, about cellular</p>
<p class="calibre1">automata and the blind knapsack problem, about his work on solving the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Communist Central Planning problem using a network of interlocking</p>
<p class="calibre1">unmanned companies. About the impending market adjustment in</p>
<p class="calibre1">integrity, the sinister resurrection of the recording music industry,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the still-pressing need to dismantle Mars.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">When she steps out of the shower, he tells her that he loves her. She</p>
<p class="calibre1">kisses him and slides his glasses and earpieces off his head so that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’s really naked, sits on his lap, and fucks his brains out again,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and whispers in his ear that she loves him and wants to be his</p>
<p class="calibre1">manager. Then she leads him into her bedroom and tells him exactly</p>
<p class="calibre1">what she wants him to wear, and she puts on her own clothes, and she</p>
<p class="calibre1">gives him a mirror with some white powder on it to sniff. When she’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">got him dolled up they go out for a night of really serious clubbing,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette in a tuxedo and Manfred in a blond wig, red silk</p>

<p class="calibre1">meows urgently. He sits up, feeling unaccustomed silk underwear</p>
<p class="calibre1">rubbing against incredibly sore skin - he’s fully dressed, just</p>
<p class="calibre1">sprawled out on the sofa. Snores emanate from the bedroom; the banging</p>

<p class="calibre1">his head, stands up, and nearly falls flat on his face: He hasn’t even</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken those ridiculous high heels off. How much did I drink last</p>
<p class="calibre1">night? he wonders. His glasses are on the breakfast bar; he pulls them</p>
<p class="calibre1">on and is besieged by an urgent flurry of ideas demanding attention.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He straightens his wig, picks up his skirts, and trips across to the</p>

<p class="calibre1">routed his old suitcase to Mombasa and in return sent this new one to</p>

<p class="calibre1">to supplant. The forensics dude and dudette, a pair of cute, tanned</p>

<p class="calibre1">into various corners and agree that there’s something not unlike gun</p>

<p class="calibre1">they focused on copy prevention technologies, the Mafiya were the only</p>
<p class="calibre1">people who would buy the old business model. These guys add a whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">new meaning to copy protection: This was just a polite cease and</p>

<p class="calibre1">try to block any music distribution channel they don’t own. Not very</p>

<p class="calibre1">part of six hours and is getting a panicky butterfly stomach at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">idea of not being in touch with everything that’s happened in the last</p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty kiloseconds. “I need to know more. Something in that report</p>

<p class="calibre1">invisible keypads and eyeballs jiggling as his glasses funnel deep</p>

<p class="calibre1">these companies - and there are currently more than sixteen thousand</p>
<p class="calibre1">of them, although the herd is growing day by day - has three directors</p>
<p class="calibre1">and is the director of three other companies. Each of them executes a</p>
<p class="calibre1">script in a functional language Manfred invented; the directors tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">the company what to do, and the instructions include orders to pass</p>
<p class="calibre1">instructions on to their children. In effect, they are a flock of</p>
<p class="calibre1">cellular automata, like the cells in Conway’s Game of Life, only far</p>
<p class="calibre1">more complex and powerful.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred’s companies form a programmable grid. Some of them are armed</p>
<p class="calibre1">with capital in the form of patents Manfred filed, then delegated</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather than passing on to one of the Free Foundations. Some of them</p>
<p class="calibre1">are effectively nontrading, but occupy directorial roles. Their</p>
<p class="calibre1">corporate functions (such as filing of accounts and voting in new</p>
<p class="calibre1">directors) are all handled centrally through his company-operating</p>
<p class="calibre1">framework, and their trading is carried out via several of the more</p>
<p class="calibre1">popular B2B enabler dot-coms. Internally, the companies do other, more</p>
<p class="calibre1">obscure load-balancing computations, processing resource-allocation</p>
<p class="calibre1">problems like a classic state central planning system. None of which</p>
<p class="calibre1">explains why fully half of them have been hit by lawsuits in the past</p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty-two hours.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lawsuits are … random. That’s the only pattern Manfred can</p>
<p class="calibre1">detect. Some of them allege patent infringements; these he might take</p>
<p class="calibre1">seriously, except that about a third of the targets are director</p>
<p class="calibre1">companies that don’t actually do anything visible to the public. A few</p>
<p class="calibre1">lawsuits allege mismanagement, but then there’s a whole bizarre raft</p>
<p class="calibre1">of spurious nonsense: suits for wrongful dismissal or age</p>
<p class="calibre1">discrimination - against companies with no employees - complaints</p>
<p class="calibre1">about reckless trading, and one action alleging that the defendant (in</p>
<p class="calibre1">conspiracy with the prime minister of Japan, the government of Canada,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the Emir of Kuwait) is using orbital mind-control lasers to make</p>
<p class="calibre1">the plaintiff’s pet chihuahua bark at all hours of day and night.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred groans and does a quick calculation. At the current rate,</p>
<p class="calibre1">lawsuits are hitting his corporate grid at a rate of one every sixteen</p>
<p class="calibre1">seconds - up from none in the preceding six months. In another day,</p>
<p class="calibre1">this is going to saturate him. If it keeps up for a week, it’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">saturate every court in the United States. Someone has found a means</p>
<p class="calibre1">to do for lawsuits what he’s doing for companies - and they’ve chosen</p>
<p class="calibre1">him as their target.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">To say that Manfred is unamused is an understatement. If he wasn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">already preoccupied with Annette’s emotional state and edgy from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">intrusion, he’d be livid - but he’s still human enough that he</p>
<p class="calibre1">responds to human stimuli first. So he determines to do something</p>
<p class="calibre1">about it, but he’s still flashing on the floating gun, her</p>
<p class="calibre1">cross-dressing cool.</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Macx! The elusive Mr. Macx!” Glashwiecz sounds positively overjoyed</p>

<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred winces. “Who is this?” he asks.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I called you yesterday,” says the lawyer; “You should have listened.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">He chortles horribly. “Now I have you!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred holds the phone away from his face, like something poisonous.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m recording this,” he warns. “Who the hell are you and what do you</p>
<p class="calibre1">want?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your wife has retained my partnership’s services to pursue her</p>

<p class="calibre1">point out without prejudice that your options are running out. I have</p>
<p class="calibre1">an order, signed in court three days ago, to have all your assets</p>
<p class="calibre1">frozen. These ridiculous shell companies notwithstanding, she’s going</p>
<p class="calibre1">to take you for exactly what you owe her. After tax, of course. She’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">very insistent on that point.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred glances round, puts his phone on hold for a moment: “Where’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">my suitcase?” he asks Aineko. The cat sidles away, ignoring him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shit.” He can’t see the new luggage anywhere. Quite possibly it’s on</p>
<p class="calibre1">its way to Morocco, complete with its priceless cargo of high-density</p>
<p class="calibre1">noise. He returns his attention to the phone. Glashwiecz is droning on</p>
<p class="calibre1">about equitable settlements, cumulative IRS tax demands - that seem to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have materialized out of fantasy with Pam’s imprimatur on them - and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the need to make a clean breast of things in court and confess to his</p>
<p class="calibre1">sins. “Where’s the fucking suitcase?” He takes the phone off hold.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shut the fuck up, please, I’m trying to think.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not going to shut up! You’re on the court docket already, Macx.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You can’t evade your responsibilities forever. You’ve got a wife and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">helpless daughter to care for -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A daughter?” That cuts right through Manfred’s preoccupation with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">suitcase.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Didn’t you know?” Glashwiecz sounds pleasantly surprised. “She was</p>
<p class="calibre1">decanted last Thursday. Perfectly healthy, I’m told. I thought you</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew; you have viewing rights via the clinic webcam. Anyway, I’ll just</p>
<p class="calibre1">leave you with this thought - the sooner you come to a settlement, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sooner I can unfreeze your companies. Goodbye.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The suitcase rolls into view, peeping coyly out from behind Annette’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">dressing table. Manfred breathes a sigh of relief and beckons to it;</p>
<p class="calibre1">at the moment, it’s easier to deal with his Plan B than dawn raids by</p>
<p class="calibre1">objectivist gangsters, Annette’s sulk, his wife’s incessant legal</p>

<p class="calibre1">Manfred emerges from the Stazione Termini into dusty sunlight,</p>
<p class="calibre1">blinking like an owl. His glasses keep up a rolling monologue about</p>
<p class="calibre1">who lived where in the days of the late Republic. They’re stuck on a</p>
<p class="calibre1">tourist channel and won’t come unglued from that much history without</p>
<p class="calibre1">a struggle. Manfred doesn’t feel like a struggle right now. He feels</p>
<p class="calibre1">like he’s been sucked dry over the weekend: a light, hollow husk that</p>
<p class="calibre1">might blow away in a stiff breeze. He hasn’t had a patentable idea all</p>
<p class="calibre1">day. This is not a good state to be in on a Monday morning when he’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">due to meet the former Minister for Economic Affairs, in order to give</p>
<p class="calibre1">him a gift that will probably get the minister a shot at higher office</p>
<p class="calibre1">and get Pam’s lawyer off his back. But somehow he can’t bring himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">to worry too much: Annette has been good for him.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ex-minister’s private persona isn’t what Manfred was expecting.</p>
<p class="calibre1">All Manfred has seen so far is a polished public avatar in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">traditionally cut suit, addressing the Chamber of Deputies in</p>
<p class="calibre1">cyberspace; which is why, when he rings the doorbell set in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">whitewashed doorframe of Gianni’s front door, he isn’t expecting a</p>
<p class="calibre1">piece of Tom of Finland beefcake, complete with breechclout and peaked</p>
<p class="calibre1">leather cap, to answer.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello, I am here to see the minister,” Manfred says carefully.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko, perched on his left shoulder, attempts to translate: It trills</p>
<p class="calibre1">something that sounds extremely urgent. Everything sounds urgent in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Italian.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s okay, I’m from Iowa,” says the guy in the doorway. He tucks a</p>
<p class="calibre1">thumb under one leather strap and grins over his moustache: “What’s it</p>
<p class="calibre1">about?” Over his shoulder: “Gianni! Visitor!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s about the economy,” Manfred says carefully. “I’m here to make it</p>
<p class="calibre1">obsolete.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The beefcake backs away from the door cautiously - then the minister</p>
<p class="calibre1">appears behind him. “Ah, signore Macx! It’s okay, Johnny, I have been</p>
<p class="calibre1">expecting him.” Gianni extends a rapid welcome, like a hyperactive</p>
<p class="calibre1">gnome buried in a white toweling bathrobe: “Please come in, my friend!</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m sure you must be tired from your journey. A refreshment for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">guest if you please, Johnny. Would you prefer coffee or something</p>
<p class="calibre1">stronger?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five minutes later, Manfred is buried up to his ears in a sofa covered</p>
<p class="calibre1">in buttery white cowhide, a cup of virulently strong espresso balanced</p>
<p class="calibre1">precariously on his knee, while Gianni Vittoria himself holds forth on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the problems of implementing a postindustrial ecosystem on top of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bureaucratic system with its roots in the bullheadedly modernist era</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the 1920s. Gianni is a visionary of the left, a strange attractor</p>
<p class="calibre1">within the chaotic phase-space of Italian politics. A former professor</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Marxist economics, his ideas are informed by a painfully honest</p>
<p class="calibre1">humanism, and everyone - even his enemies - agrees that he is one of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the greatest theoreticians of the post-EU era. But his intellectual</p>
<p class="calibre1">integrity prevents him from rising to the very top, and his fellow</p>
<p class="calibre1">travelers are much ruder about him than his ideological enemies,</p>
<p class="calibre1">accusing him of the ultimate political crime \emdash valuing truth</p>
<p class="calibre1">over power.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred had met Gianni a couple of years earlier via a hosted politics</p>
<p class="calibre1">chat room; at the beginning of last week, he sent him a paper</p>
<p class="calibre1">detailing his embeddable planned economy and a proposal for using it</p>
<p class="calibre1">to turbocharge the endless Italian attempt to re-engineer its</p>
<p class="calibre1">government systems. This is the thin end of the wedge: If Manfred is</p>
<p class="calibre1">right, it could catalyse a whole new wave of communist expansion,</p>
<p class="calibre1">driven by humanitarian ideals and demonstrably superior performance,</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather than wishful thinking and ideology.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is impossible, I fear. This is Italy, my friend. Everybody has to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have their say. Not everybody even understands what it is we are</p>
<p class="calibre1">talking about, but that won’t stop them talking about it. Since 1945,</p>
<p class="calibre1">our government requires consensus - a reaction to what came before. Do</p>
<p class="calibre1">you know, we have five different routes to putting forward a new law,</p>
<p class="calibre1">two of them added as emergency measures to break the gridlock? And</p>
<p class="calibre1">none of them work on their own unless you can get everybody to agree.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Your plan is daring and radical, but if it works, we must understand</p>
<p class="calibre1">why we work - and that digs right to the root of being human, and not</p>
<p class="calibre1">everybody will agree.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">At this point Manfred realizes that he’s lost. “I don’t understand,”</p>
<p class="calibre1">he says, genuinely puzzled. “What has the human condition got to do</p>
<p class="calibre1">with economics?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The minister sighs abruptly. “You are very unusual. You earn no money,</p>
<p class="calibre1">do you? But you are rich, because grateful people who have benefited</p>
<p class="calibre1">from your work give you everything you need. You are like a medieval</p>
<p class="calibre1">troubadour who has found favor with the aristocracy. Your labor is not</p>
<p class="calibre1">alienated - it is given freely, and your means of production is with</p>
<p class="calibre1">you always, inside your head.” Manfred blinks; the jargon is weirdly</p>
<p class="calibre1">technical-sounding but orthogonal to his experience, offering him a</p>
<p class="calibre1">disquieting glimpse into the world of the terminally future-shocked.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He is surprised to find that not understanding itches.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gianni taps his balding temple with a knuckle like a walnut. “Most</p>
<p class="calibre1">people spend little time inside their heads. They don’t understand how</p>
<p class="calibre1">you live. They’re like medieval peasants looking in puzzlement at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">troubadour. This system you invent, for running a planned economy, is</p>
<p class="calibre1">delightful and elegant: Lenin’s heirs would have been awestruck. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">it is not a system for the new century. It is not human.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred scratches his head. “It seems to me that there’s nothing human</p>
<p class="calibre1">about the economics of scarcity,” he says. “Anyway, humans will be</p>
<p class="calibre1">obsolete as economic units within a couple more decades. All I want to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do is make everybody rich beyond their wildest dreams before that</p>
<p class="calibre1">happens.” A pause for a sip of coffee, and to think, one honest</p>
<p class="calibre1">statement deserves another: “And to pay off a divorce settlement.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ye-es? Well, let me show you my library, my friend,” he says,</p>
<p class="calibre1">standing up. “This way.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gianni ambles out of the white living room with its carnivorous</p>
<p class="calibre1">leather sofas, and up a cast-iron spiral staircase that nails some</p>
<p class="calibre1">kind of upper level to the underside of the roof. “Human beings aren’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">rational,” he calls over his shoulder. “That was the big mistake of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Chicago School economists, neoliberals to a man, and of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">predecessors, too. If human behavior was logical, there would be no</p>
<p class="calibre1">gambling, hmm? The house always wins, after all.” The staircase</p>
<p class="calibre1">debouches into another airy whitewashed room, where one wall is</p>
<p class="calibre1">occupied by a wooden bench supporting a number of ancient,</p>
<p class="calibre1">promiscuously cabled servers and a very new, eye-wateringly expensive</p>
<p class="calibre1">solid volume renderer. Opposite the bench is a wall occupied from</p>
<p class="calibre1">floor to ceiling by bookcases: Manfred looks at the ancient,</p>
<p class="calibre1">low-density medium and sneezes, momentarily bemused by the sight of</p>
<p class="calibre1">data density measured in kilograms per megabyte rather than vice</p>
<p class="calibre1">versa.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s it fabbing?” Manfred asks, pointing at the renderer, which is</p>
<p class="calibre1">whining to itself and slowly sintering together something that</p>
<p class="calibre1">resembles a carriage clockmaker’s fever dream of a spring-powered hard</p>
<p class="calibre1">disk drive.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, one of Johnny’s toys - a micromechanical digital phonograph</p>
<p class="calibre1">player,” Gianni says dismissively. “He used to design Babbage engines</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the Pentagon - stealth computers. (No van Eck radiation, you</p>
<p class="calibre1">know.) Look.” He carefully pulls a fabric-bound document out of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">obsolescent data wall and shows the spine to Manfred: “On the Theory</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Games, by John von Neumann. Signed first edition.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko meeps and dumps a slew of confusing purple finite state</p>
<p class="calibre1">automata into Manfred’s left eye. The hardback is dusty and dry</p>
<p class="calibre1">beneath his fingertips as he remembers to turn the pages gently. “This</p>
<p class="calibre1">copy belonged to the personal library of Oleg Kordiovsky. A lucky man</p>
<p class="calibre1">is Oleg: He bought it in 1952, while on a visit to New York, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">MVD let him to keep it.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He must be -” Manfred pauses. More data, historical time lines. “Part</p>
<p class="calibre1">of GosPlan?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Correct.” Gianni smiles thinly. “Two years before the central</p>
<p class="calibre1">committee denounced computers as bourgeois deviationist pseudoscience</p>
<p class="calibre1">intended to dehumanize the proletarian. They recognized the power of</p>
<p class="calibre1">robots even then. A shame they did not anticipate the compiler or the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Net.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t understand the significance. Nobody back then could expect</p>
<p class="calibre1">that the main obstacle to doing away with market capitalism would be</p>
<p class="calibre1">overcome within half a century, surely?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indeed not. But it’s true: Since the 1980s, it has been possible - in</p>
<p class="calibre1">principle - to resolve resource allocation problems algorithmically,</p>
<p class="calibre1">by computer, instead of needing a market. Markets are wasteful: They</p>
<p class="calibre1">allow competition, much of which is thrown on the scrap heap. So why</p>
<p class="calibre1">do they persist?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred shrugs. “You tell me. Conservativism?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gianni closes the book and puts it back on the shelf. “Markets afford</p>
<p class="calibre1">their participants the illusion of free will, my friend. You will find</p>
<p class="calibre1">that human beings do not like being forced into doing something, even</p>
<p class="calibre1">if it is in their best interests. Of necessity, a command economy must</p>
<p class="calibre1">be coercive - it does, after all, command.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But my system doesn’t! It mediates where supplies go, not who has to</p>
<p class="calibre1">produce what -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gianni is shaking his head. “Backward chaining or forward chaining, it</p>
<p class="calibre1">is still an expert system, my friend. Your companies need no human</p>
<p class="calibre1">beings, and this is a good thing, but they must not direct the</p>
<p class="calibre1">activities of human beings, either. If they do, you have just enslaved</p>
<p class="calibre1">people to an abstract machine, as dictators have throughout history.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred’s eyes scan along the bookshelf. “But the market itself is an</p>
<p class="calibre1">abstract machine! A lousy one, too. I’m mostly free of it - but how</p>
<p class="calibre1">long is it going to continue oppressing people?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe not as long as you fear.” Gianni sits down next to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">renderer, which is currently extruding the inference mill of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">analytical engine. “The marginal value of money decreases, after all:</p>
<p class="calibre1">The more you have, the less it means to you. We are on the edge of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">period of prolonged economic growth, with annual averages in excess of</p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty percent, if the Council of Europe’s predictor metrics are</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything to go by. The last of the flaccid industrial economy has</p>
<p class="calibre1">withered away, and this era’s muscle of economic growth, what used to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be the high-technology sector, is now everything. We can afford a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little wastage, my friend, if that is the price of keeping people</p>
<p class="calibre1">happy until the marginal value of money withers away completely.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Realization dawns. “You want to abolish scarcity, not just money!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indeed.” Gianni grins. “There’s more to that than mere economic</p>
<p class="calibre1">performance; you have to consider abundance as a factor. Don’t plan</p>
<p class="calibre1">the economy; take things out of the economy. Do you pay for the air</p>
<p class="calibre1">you breathe? Should uploaded minds - who will be the backbone of our</p>
<p class="calibre1">economy, by and by - have to pay for processor cycles? No and no. Now,</p>
<p class="calibre1">do you want to know how you can pay for your divorce settlement? And</p>
<p class="calibre1">can I interest you, and your interestingly accredited new manager, in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a little project of mine?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The shutters are thrown back, the curtains tied out of the way, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette’s huge living room windows are drawn open in the morning</p>
<p class="calibre1">breeze.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred sits on a leather-topped piano stool, his suitcase open at his</p>
<p class="calibre1">feet. He’s running a link from the case to Annette’s stereo, an</p>
<p class="calibre1">antique stand-alone unit with a satellite Internet uplink. Someone has</p>
<p class="calibre1">chipped it, crudely revoking its copy protection algorithm: The back</p>
<p class="calibre1">of its case bears scars from the soldering iron. Annette is curled up</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the huge sofa, wrapped in a kaftan and a pair of high-bandwidth</p>
<p class="calibre1">goggles, thrashing out an internal Arianespace scheduling problem with</p>
<p class="calibre1">some colleagues in Iran and Guyana.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">His suitcase is full of noise, but what’s coming out of the stereo is</p>
<p class="calibre1">ragtime. Subtract entropy from a data stream - coincidentally</p>
<p class="calibre1">uncompressing it - and what’s left is information. With a capacity of</p>
<p class="calibre1">about a trillion terabytes, the suitcase’s holographic storage</p>
<p class="calibre1">reservoir has enough capacity to hold every music, film, and video</p>
<p class="calibre1">production of the twentieth century with room to spare. This is all</p>
<p class="calibre1">stuff that is effectively out of copyright control, work-for-hire</p>
<p class="calibre1">owned by bankrupt companies, released before the CCAA could make their</p>
<p class="calibre1">media clampdown stick. Manfred is streaming the music through</p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette’s stereo - but keeping the noise it was convoluted with.</p>
<p class="calibre1">High-grade entropy is valuable, too …</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Presently, Manfred sighs and pushes his glasses up his forehead,</p>
<p class="calibre1">killing the displays. He’s thought his way around every permutation of</p>
<p class="calibre1">what’s going on, and it looks like Gianni was right: There’s nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">left to do but wait for everyone to show up.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For a moment, he feels old and desolate, as slow as an unassisted</p>
<p class="calibre1">human mind. Agencies have been swapping in and out of his head for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">past day, ever since he got back from Rome. He’s developed a butterfly</p>
<p class="calibre1">attention span, irritable and unable to focus on anything while the</p>
<p class="calibre1">information streams fight it out for control of his cortex, arguing</p>
<p class="calibre1">about a solution to his predicament. Annette is putting up with his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mood swings surprisingly calmly. He’s not sure why, but he glances her</p>
<p class="calibre1">way fondly. Her obsessions run surprisingly deep, and she’s quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">clearly using him for her own purposes. So why does he feel more</p>
<p class="calibre1">comfortable around her than he did with Pam?</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She stretches and pushes her goggles up. “Oui?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was just thinking.” He smiles. “Three days and you haven’t told me</p>
<p class="calibre1">what I should be doing with myself, yet.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She pulls a face. “Why would I do that?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, no reason. I’m just not over - ” He shrugs uncomfortably. There</p>
<p class="calibre1">it is, an inexplicable absence in his life, but not one he feels he</p>
<p class="calibre1">urgently needs to fill yet. Is this what a relationship between equals</p>
<p class="calibre1">feels like? He’s not sure: Starting with the occlusive cocooning of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his upbringing and continuing through all his adult relationships,</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’s been effectively - voluntarily - dominated by his partners. Maybe</p>
<p class="calibre1">the antisubmissive conditioning is working, after all. But if so, why</p>
<p class="calibre1">the creative malaise? Why isn’t he coming up with original new ideas</p>
<p class="calibre1">this week? Could it be that his peculiar brand of creativity is an</p>
<p class="calibre1">outlet, that he needs the pressure of being lovingly enslaved to make</p>
<p class="calibre1">him burst out into a great flowering of imaginative brilliance? Or</p>
<p class="calibre1">could it be that he really is missing Pam?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette stands up and walks over, slowly. He looks at her and feels</p>
<p class="calibre1">lust and affection, and isn’t sure whether or not this is love. “When</p>
<p class="calibre1">are they due?” she asks, leaning over him.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Any -” The doorbell chimes.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah. I will get that.” She stalks away, opens the door.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred’s head snaps round as if he’s on a leash. Her leash: But he</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t expecting her to come in person.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, me,” Annette says easily. “Come in. Be my guest.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pam enters the apartment living room with flashing eyes, her tame</p>
<p class="calibre1">lawyer in tow. “Well, look what the robot kitty dragged in,” she</p>
<p class="calibre1">drawls, fixing Manfred with an expression that owes more to anger than</p>
<p class="calibre1">to humor. It’s not like her, this blunt hostility, and he wonders</p>
<p class="calibre1">where it came from.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred rises. For a moment he’s transfixed by the sight of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">dominatrix wife, and his - mistress? conspirator? lover? - side by</p>
<p class="calibre1">side. The contrast is marked: Annette’s expression of ironic amusement</p>
<p class="calibre1">a foil for Pamela’s angry sincerity. Somewhere behind them stands a</p>
<p class="calibre1">balding middle-aged man in a suit, carrying a folio: just the kind of</p>
<p class="calibre1">diligent serf Pam might have turned him into, given time. Manfred</p>
<p class="calibre1">musters up a smile. “Can I offer you some coffee?” he asks. “The party</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the third part seems to be late.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Coffee would be great, mine’s dark, no sugar,” twitters the lawyer.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He puts his briefcase down on a side table and fiddles with his</p>
<p class="calibre1">wearable until a light begins to blink from his spectacle frames: “I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">recording this, I’m sure you understand.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette sniffs and heads for the kitchen, which is charmingly manual</p>
<p class="calibre1">but not very efficient; Pam is pretending she doesn’t exist. “Well,</p>
<p class="calibre1">well, well.” She shakes her head. “I’d expected better of you than a</p>
<p class="calibre1">French tart’s boudoir, Manny. And before the ink’s dry on the divorce</p>
<p class="calibre1">- these days that’ll cost you, didn’t you think of that?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m surprised you’re not in the hospital,” he says, changing the</p>
<p class="calibre1">subject. “Is postnatal recovery outsourced these days?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The employers.” She slips her coat off her shoulders and hangs it</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind the broad wooden door. “They subsidize everything when you</p>
<p class="calibre1">reach my grade.” Pamela is wearing a very short, very expensive dress,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the kind of weapon in the war between the sexes that ought to come</p>
<p class="calibre1">with an end-user certificate: But to his surprise it has no effect on</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. He realizes that he’s completely unable to evaluate her gender,</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost as if she’s become a member of another species. “As you’d be</p>
<p class="calibre1">aware if you’d been paying attention.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I always pay attention, Pam. It’s the only currency I carry.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very droll, ha-ha,” interrupts Glashwiecz. “You do realize that</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re paying me while I stand here listening to this fascinating</p>
<p class="calibre1">byplay?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred stares at him. “You know I don’t have any money.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,” Glashwiecz smiles, “but you must be mistaken. Certainly the</p>
<p class="calibre1">judge will agree with me that you must be mistaken - all a lack of</p>
<p class="calibre1">paper documentation means is that you’ve covered your trail. There’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">the small matter of the several thousand corporations you own,</p>
<p class="calibre1">indirectly. Somewhere at the bottom of that pile there has got to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">something, hasn’t there?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">A hissing, burbling noise like a sackful of large lizards being</p>
<p class="calibre1">drowned in mud emanates from the kitchen, suggesting that Annette’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">percolator is nearly ready. Manfred’s left hand twitches, playing</p>
<p class="calibre1">chords on an air keyboard. Without being at all obvious, he’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">releasing a bulletin about his current activities that should soon</p>
<p class="calibre1">have an effect on the reputation marketplace. “Your attack was rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">elegant,” he comments, sitting down on the sofa as Pam disappears into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the kitchen.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Glashwiecz nods. “The idea was one of my interns’,” he says. “I don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand this distributed denial of service stuff, but Lisa grew up</p>
<p class="calibre1">on it. Something about it being a legal travesty, but workable all the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh-huh.” Manfred’s opinion of the lawyer drops a notch. He notices</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pam reappearing from the kitchen, her expression icy. A moment later</p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette surfaces carrying a jug and some cups, beaming innocently.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Something’s going on, but at that moment, one of his agents nudges him</p>
<p class="calibre1">urgently in the left ear, his suitcase keens mournfully and beams a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sense of utter despair at him, and the doorbell rings again.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So what’s the scam?” Glashwiecz sits down uncomfortably close to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred and murmurs out of one side of his mouth. “Where’s the money?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred looks at him irritably. “There is no money,” he says. “The</p>
<p class="calibre1">idea is to make money obsolete. Hasn’t she explained that?” His eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">wander, taking in the lawyer’s Patek Philippe watch, his Java-enabled</p>
<p class="calibre1">signet ring.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“C’mon. Don’t give me that line. Look, all it takes is a couple of</p>
<p class="calibre1">million, and you can buy your way free for all I care. All I’m here</p>
<p class="calibre1">for is to see that your wife and daughter don’t get left penniless and</p>
<p class="calibre1">starving. You know and I know that you’ve got bags of it stuffed away</p>
<p class="calibre1">- just look at your reputation! You didn’t get that by standing at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">roadside with a begging bowl, did you?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred snorts. “You’re talking about an elite IRS auditor here. She</p>
<p class="calibre1">isn’t penniless; she gets a commission on every poor bastard she takes</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the cleaners, and she was born with a trust fund. Me, I -” The</p>
<p class="calibre1">stereo bleeps. Manfred pulls his glasses on. Whispering ghosts of dead</p>
<p class="calibre1">artists hum through his earlobes, urgently demanding their freedom.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone knocks at the door again, and he glances around to see Annette</p>
<p class="calibre1">walking toward it.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re making it hard on yourself,” Glashwiecz warns.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Expecting company?” Pam asks, one brittle eyebrow raised in Manfred’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">direction.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not exactly -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette opens the door and a couple of guards in full SWAT gear march</p>
<p class="calibre1">in. They’re clutching gadgets that look like crosses between digital</p>
<p class="calibre1">sewing machines and grenade launchers, and their helmets are studded</p>
<p class="calibre1">with so many sensors that they resemble 1950s space probes. “That’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">them,” Annette says clearly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mais Oui.” The door closes itself and the guards stand to either</p>
<p class="calibre1">side. Annette stalks toward Pam.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You think to walk in here, to my pied-a-terre, and take from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred?” she sniffs.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re making a big mistake, lady,” Pam says, her voice steady and</p>
<p class="calibre1">cold enough to liquefy helium.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">A burst of static from one of the troopers. “No,” Annette says</p>
<p class="calibre1">distantly. “No mistake.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She points at Glashwiecz. “Are you aware of the takeover?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Takeover?” The lawyer looks puzzled, but not alarmed by the presence</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the guards.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As of three hours ago,” Manfred says quietly, “I sold a controlling</p>
<p class="calibre1">interest in agalmic.holdings.root.1.1.1 to Athene Accelerants BV, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">venture capital outfit from Maastricht. One dot one dot one is the</p>
<p class="calibre1">root node of the central planning tree. Athene aren’t your usual VC,</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’re accelerants - they take explosive business plans and detonate</p>
<p class="calibre1">them.” Glashwiecz is looking pale - whether with anger or fear of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lost commission is impossible to tell. “Actually, Athene Accelerants</p>
<p class="calibre1">is owned by a shell company owned by the Italian Communist Party’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">pension trust. The point is, you’re in the presence of one dot one dot</p>
<p class="calibre1">one’s chief operations officer.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pam looks annoyed. “Puerile attempts to dodge responsibility -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette clears her throat. “Exactly who do you think you are trying to</p>
<p class="calibre1">sue?” she asks Glashwiecz sweetly. “Here we have laws about unfair</p>
<p class="calibre1">restraint of trade. Also about foreign political interference,</p>
<p class="calibre1">specifically in the financial affairs of an Italian party of</p>
<p class="calibre1">government.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You wouldn’t -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I would.” Manfred brushes his hands on his knees and stands up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Done, yet?” he asks the suitcase.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Muffled beeps, then a gravelly synthesized voice speaks. “Uploads</p>
<p class="calibre1">completed.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, good.” He grins at Annette. “Time for our next guests?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">On cue, the doorbell rings again. The guards sidle to either side of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the door. Annette snaps her fingers, and it opens to admit a pair of</p>
<p class="calibre1">smartly dressed thugs. It’s beginning to get crowded in the living</p>
<p class="calibre1">room.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which one of you is Macx?” snaps the older one of the two thugs,</p>
<p class="calibre1">staring at Glashwiecz for no obvious reason. He hefts an aluminum</p>
<p class="calibre1">briefcase. “Got a writ to serve.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’d be the CCAA?” asks Manfred.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You bet. If you’re Macx, I have a restraining order -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred raises a hand. “It’s not me you want,” he says. “It’s this</p>
<p class="calibre1">lady.” He points at Pam, whose mouth opens in silent protest. “Y’see,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the intellectual property you’re chasing wants to be free. It’s so</p>
<p class="calibre1">free that it’s now administered by a complex set of corporate</p>
<p class="calibre1">instruments lodged in the Netherlands, and the prime shareholder as of</p>
<p class="calibre1">approximately four minutes ago is my soon-to-be-ex-wife Pamela, here.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">He winks at Glashwiecz. “Except she doesn’t control anything.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just what do you think you’re playing at, Manfred?” Pamela snarls,</p>
<p class="calibre1">unable to contain herself any longer. The guards shuffle: The larger,</p>
<p class="calibre1">junior CCAA enforcer tugs at his boss’s jacket nervously.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well.” Manfred picks up his coffee and takes a sip. Grimaces. “Pam</p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted a divorce settlement, didn’t she? The most valuable assets I</p>
<p class="calibre1">own are the rights to a whole bunch of recategorized work-for-hire</p>
<p class="calibre1">that slipped through the CCAA’s fingers a few years back. Part of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">twentieth century’s cultural heritage that got locked away by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">music industry in the last decade - Janis Joplin, the Doors, that sort</p>
<p class="calibre1">of thing. Artists who weren’t around to defend themselves anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When the music cartels went bust, the rights went for a walk. I took</p>
<p class="calibre1">them over originally with the idea of setting the music free. Giving</p>
<p class="calibre1">it back to the public domain, as it were.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette nods at the guards, one of whom nods back and starts muttering</p>
<p class="calibre1">and buzzing into a throat mike. Manfred continues. “I was working on a</p>
<p class="calibre1">solution to the central planning paradox - how to interface a</p>
<p class="calibre1">centrally planned enclave to a market economy. My good friend Gianni</p>
<p class="calibre1">Vittoria suggested that such a shell game could have alternative uses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So I’ve not freed the music. Instead, I signed the rights over to</p>
<p class="calibre1">various actors and threads running inside the agalmic holdings network</p>
<p class="calibre1">- currently one million, forty-eight thousand, five hundred and</p>
<p class="calibre1">seventy-five companies. They swap rights rapidly - the rights to any</p>
<p class="calibre1">given song are resident in a given company for, oh, all of fifty</p>
<p class="calibre1">milliseconds at a time. Now understand, I don’t own these companies. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t even have a financial interest in them anymore. I’ve deeded my</p>
<p class="calibre1">share of the profits to Pam, here. I’m getting out of the biz,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gianni’s suggested something rather more challenging for me to do</p>
<p class="calibre1">instead.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He takes another mouthful of coffee. The recording Mafiya goon glares</p>
<p class="calibre1">at him. Pam glares at him. Annette stands against one wall, looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">amused. “Perhaps you’d like to sort it out between you?” he asks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aside, to Glashwiecz: “I trust you’ll drop your denial of service</p>
<p class="calibre1">attack before I set the Italian parliament on you? By the way, you’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">find the book value of the intellectual property assets I deeded to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pamela - by the value these gentlemen place on them - is somewhere in</p>
<p class="calibre1">excess of a billion dollars. As that’s rather more than</p>
<p class="calibre1">ninety-nine-point-nine percent of my assets, you’ll probably want to</p>
<p class="calibre1">look elsewhere for your fees.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Glashwiecz stands up carefully. The lead goon stares at Pamela. “Is</p>
<p class="calibre1">this true?” he demands. “This little squirt give you IP assets of Sony</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bertelsmann Microsoft Music? We have claim! You come to us for</p>
<p class="calibre1">distribution or you get in deep trouble.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The second goon rumbles agreement: “Remember, dose MP3s, dey bad for</p>
<p class="calibre1">you health!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette claps her hands. “If you would to leave my apartment, please?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">The door, attentive as ever, swings open: “You are no longer welcome</p>
<p class="calibre1">here!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This means you,” Manfred advises Pam helpfully.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You bastard,” she spits at him.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred forces a smile, bemused by his inability to respond to her the</p>
<p class="calibre1">way she wants. Something’s wrong, missing, between them. “I thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">you wanted my assets. Are the encumbrances too much for you?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know what I mean! You and that two-bit Euro-whore! I’ll nail you</p>
<p class="calibre1">for child neglect!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">His smile freezes. “Try it, and I’ll sue you for breach of patent</p>
<p class="calibre1">rights. My genome, you understand.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pam is taken aback by this. “You patented your own genome? What</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened to the brave new communist, sharing information freely?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred stops smiling. “Divorce happened. And the Italian Communist</p>
<p class="calibre1">Party happened.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She turns on her heel and stalks out of the apartment bravely, tame</p>
<p class="calibre1">attorney in tow behind her, muttering about class action lawsuits and</p>
<p class="calibre1">violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The CCAA lawyer’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">tame gorilla makes a grab for Glashwiecz’s shoulder, and the guards</p>
<p class="calibre1">move in, hustling the whole movable feast out into the stairwell. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">door slams shut on a chaos of impending recursive lawsuits, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred breathes a huge wheeze of relief.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette walks over to him and leans her chin on the top of his head.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Think it will work?” she asks.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, the CCAA will sue the hell out of the company network for a</p>
<p class="calibre1">while if they try to distribute by any channel that isn’t controlled</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the Mafiya. Pam gets rights to all the music, her settlement, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">she can’t sell it without going through the mob. And I got to serve</p>
<p class="calibre1">notice on that legal shark: If he tries to take me on he’s got to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">politically bullet-proof. Hmm. Maybe I ought not to plan on going back</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the USA this side of the singularity.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Profits,” Annette sighs, “I do not easily understand this way of</p>
<p class="calibre1">yours. Or this apocalyptic obsession with singularity.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Remember the old aphorism, if you love something, set it free? I</p>
<p class="calibre1">freed the music.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you didn’t! You signed rights over -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But first I uploaded the entire stash to several cryptographically</p>
<p class="calibre1">anonymized public network filesystems over the past few hours, so</p>
<p class="calibre1">there’ll be rampant piracy. And the robot companies are all set to</p>
<p class="calibre1">automagically grant any and every copyright request they receive,</p>
<p class="calibre1">royalty-free, until the goons figure out how to hack them. But that’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">not the point. The point is abundance. The Mafiya can’t stop it being</p>
<p class="calibre1">distributed. Pam is welcome to her cut if she can figure an angle -</p>
<p class="calibre1">but I bet she can’t. She still believes in classical economics, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">allocation of resources under conditions of scarcity. Information</p>
<p class="calibre1">doesn’t work that way. What matters is that people will be able to</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear the music - instead of a Soviet central planning system, I’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned the network into a firewall to protect freed intellectual</p>
<p class="calibre1">property.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, Manfred, you hopeless idealist.” She strokes his shoulder.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whatever for?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not just the music. When we develop a working AI or upload minds</p>
<p class="calibre1">we’ll need a way of defending it against legal threats. That’s what</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gianni pointed out to me …”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s still explaining to her how he’s laying the foundations for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">transhuman explosion due early in the next decade when she picks him</p>
<p class="calibre1">up in both arms, carries him to her bedroom, and commits outrageous</p>
<p class="calibre1">acts of tender intimacy with him. But that’s okay. He’s still human,</p>
<p class="calibre1">this decade.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">This, too, will pass, thinks the bulk of his metacortex. And it drifts</p>
<p class="calibre1">off into the net to think deep thoughts elsewhere, leaving his</p>
<p class="calibre1">meatbody to experience the ancient pleasures of the flesh set free.</p>
