<h2 id="calibre_toc_14" class="calibre3">Chapter 7: Curator</h2><p class="calibre1">Sirhan stands on the edge of an abyss, looking down at a churning</p>
<p class="calibre1">orange-and-gray cloudscape far below. The air this close to the edge</p>
<p class="calibre1">is chilly and smells slightly of ammonia, although that might be his</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagination at work - there’s little chance of any gas exchange taking</p>
<p class="calibre1">place across the transparent pressure wall of the flying city. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">feels as if he could reach out and touch the swirling vaporscape.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s nobody else around, this close to the edge - it’s an icy</p>
<p class="calibre1">sensation to look out across the roiling depths, at an ocean of gas so</p>
<p class="calibre1">cold human flesh would freeze within seconds of exposure, knowing that</p>
<p class="calibre1">there’s nothing solid out there for tens of thousands of kilometers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The sense of isolation is aggravated by the paucity of bandwidth, this</p>
<p class="calibre1">far out of the system. Most people huddle close to the hub, for</p>
<p class="calibre1">comfort and warmth and low latency: posthumans are gregarious.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beneath Sirhan’s feet, the lily-pad city is extending itself, mumbling</p>
<p class="calibre1">and churning in endless self-similar loops like a cubist blastoma</p>
<p class="calibre1">growing in the upper atmosphere of Saturn. Great ducts suck in methane</p>
<p class="calibre1">and other atmospheric gases, apply energy, polymerize and diamondize,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and crack off hydrogen to fill the lift cells high above. Beyond the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sapphire dome of the city’s gasbag, an azure star glares with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">speckle of laser light; humanity’s first - and so far, last -</p>
<p class="calibre1">starship, braking into orbit on the last shredded remnant of its light</p>
<p class="calibre1">sail.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s wondering maliciously how his mother will react to discovering</p>
<p class="calibre1">her bankruptcy when the light above him flickers. Something gray and</p>
<p class="calibre1">unpleasant splatters against the curve of nearly invisible wall in</p>
<p class="calibre1">front of him, leaving a smear. He takes a step back and looks up</p>
<p class="calibre1">angrily. “Fuck you!” he yells. Raucous cooing laughter follows him</p>
<p class="calibre1">away from the boundary, feral pigeon voices mocking. “I mean it,” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">warns, flicking a gesture at the air above his head. Wings scatter in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a burst of thunder as a slab of wind solidifies, thistledown-shaped</p>
<p class="calibre1">nanomachines suspended on the breeze locking edge to edge to form an</p>
<p class="calibre1">umbrella over his head. He walks away from the perimeter, fuming,</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaving the pigeons to look for another victim.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annoyed, Sirhan finds a grassy knoll a couple of hundred meters from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the rim and around the curve of the lily-pad from the museum</p>
<p class="calibre1">buildings. It’s far enough from other humans that he can sit</p>
<p class="calibre1">undisturbed with his thoughts, far enough out to see over the edge</p>
<p class="calibre1">without being toilet-bombed by flocking flying rats. (The flying city,</p>
<p class="calibre1">despite being the product of an advanced technology almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">unimaginable two decades before, is full of bugs - software complexity</p>
<p class="calibre1">and scaling laws ensured that the preceding decades of change acted as</p>
<p class="calibre1">a kind of cosmological inflationary period for design glitches, and an</p>
<p class="calibre1">infestation of passenger pigeons is by no means the most inexplicable</p>
<p class="calibre1">problem this biosphere harbors.)</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">In an attempt to shut the more unwelcome manifestations of cybernature</p>
<p class="calibre1">out, he sits under the shade of an apple tree and marshals his worlds</p>
<p class="calibre1">around him. “When is my grandmother arriving?” he asks one of them,</p>
<p class="calibre1">speaking into an antique telephone in the world of servants, where</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything is obedient and knows its place. The city humors him, for</p>
<p class="calibre1">its own reasons.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She is still containerized, but aerobraking is nearly over. Her body</p>
<p class="calibre1">will be arriving downwell in less than two megaseconds.” The city’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">avatar in this machinima is a discreet Victorian butler, stony-faced</p>
<p class="calibre1">and respectful. Sirhan eschews intrusive memory interfaces; for an</p>
<p class="calibre1">eighteen-year-old, he’s conservative to the point of affectation,</p>
<p class="calibre1">favoring voice commands and anthropomorphic agents over the invisible</p>
<p class="calibre1">splicing of virtual neural nets.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re certain she’s transferred successfully?” Sirhan asks</p>
<p class="calibre1">anxiously. He heard a lot about his grandmama when he was young, very</p>
<p class="calibre1">little of it complimentary. Nevertheless, the old bat must be a lot</p>
<p class="calibre1">more flexible than his mother ever gave her credit for, to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">subjecting herself to this kind of treatment for the first time at her</p>
<p class="calibre1">current age.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m as certain as I can be, young master, for anyone who insists on</p>
<p class="calibre1">sticking to their original phenotype without benefit of off-line</p>
<p class="calibre1">backup or medical implants. I regret that omniscience is not within my</p>
<p class="calibre1">remit. Would you like me to make further specific inquiries?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” Sirhan peers up at the bright flare of laser light, visible even</p>
<p class="calibre1">through the soap-bubble membrane that holds in the breathable gas mix,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the trillions of liters of hot hydrogen in the canopy above it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“As long as you’re sure she’ll arrive before the ship?” Tuning his</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes to ultraviolet, he watches the emission spikes, sees the slow</p>
<p class="calibre1">strobing of the low-bandwidth AM modulation that’s all the starship</p>
<p class="calibre1">can manage by way of downlink communication until it comes within</p>
<p class="calibre1">range of the system manifold. It’s sending the same tiresomely</p>
<p class="calibre1">repetitive question about why it’s being redirected to Saturn that</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s been putting out for the past week, querying the refusal to</p>
<p class="calibre1">supply terawatts of propulsion energy on credit.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Unless there’s a spike in their power beam, you can be certain of</p>
<p class="calibre1">that,” City replies reassuringly. “And you can be certain also that</p>
<p class="calibre1">your grandmother will revive comfortably.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One may hope so.” To undertake the interplanetary voyage in corporeal</p>
<p class="calibre1">person, at her age, without any upgrades or augmentation, must take</p>
<p class="calibre1">courage, he decides. “When she wakes up, if I’m not around, ask her</p>
<p class="calibre1">for an interview slot on my behalf. For the archives, of course.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It will be my pleasure.” City bobs his head politely.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That will be all,” Sirhan says dismissively, and the window into</p>
<p class="calibre1">servantspace closes. Then he looks back up at the pinprick of glaring</p>
<p class="calibre1">blue laser light near the zenith. Tough luck, Mom, he subvocalizes for</p>
<p class="calibre1">his journal cache. Most of his attention is forked at present, focused</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the rich historical windfall from the depths of the singularity</p>
<p class="calibre1">that is coming his way, in the form of the thirty-year-old starwhisp’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cartesian theatre. But he can still spare some schadenfreude for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">family fortunes. All your assets belong to me, now. He smiles,</p>
<p class="calibre1">inwardly. I’ll just have to make sure they’re put to a sensible use</p>
<p class="calibre1">this time.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t see why they’re diverting us toward Saturn. It’s not as if</p>
<p class="calibre1">they can possibly have dismantled Jupiter already, is it?” asks</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre, rolling the chilled beer bottle thoughtfully between fingers</p>
<p class="calibre1">and thumb.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why not you ask Amber?” replies the velociraptor squatting beside the</p>
<p class="calibre1">log table. (Boris’s Ukrainian accent is unimpeded by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dromaeosaurid’s larynx; in point of fact, it’s an affectation, one he</p>
<p class="calibre1">could easily fix by sideloading an English pronunciation patch if he</p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted to.)</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well.” Pierre shakes his head. “She’s spending all her time with that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Slug, no multiplicity access, privacy ackles locked right down. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">could get jealous.” His voice doesn’t suggest any deep concern.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s to get jealous about? Just ask to fork instance to talk to</p>
<p class="calibre1">you, make love, show boyfriend good time, whatever.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hah!” Pierre chuckles grimly, then drains the last drops from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bottle into his mouth. He throws it away in the direction of a clump</p>
<p class="calibre1">of cycads, then snaps his fingers; another one appears in its place.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are two megaseconds out from Saturn in any case,” Boris points out,</p>
<p class="calibre1">then pauses to sharpen his inch-long incisors on one end of the table.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fangs crunch through timber like wet cardboard. “Grrrrn. Am seeing</p>
<p class="calibre1">most peculiar emission spectra from inner solar system. Foggy flying</p>
<p class="calibre1">down bottom of gravity well. Am wondering, does ensmartening of dumb</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter extend past Jovian orbit now?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm.” Pierre takes a swig from the bottle and puts it down. “That</p>
<p class="calibre1">might explain the diversion. But why haven’t they powered up the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lasers on the Ring for us? You missed that, too.” For reasons unknown,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the huge battery of launch lasers had shut down, some millions of</p>
<p class="calibre1">seconds after the crew of the Field Circus had entered the router,</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaving it adrift in the cold darkness.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t know why are not talking.” Boris shrugged. “At least are still</p>
<p class="calibre1">alive there, as can tell from the ‘set course for Saturn, following</p>
<p class="calibre1">thus-and-such orbital elements’ bit. Someone is paying attention. Am</p>
<p class="calibre1">telling you from beginning, though, turning entire solar system into</p>
<p class="calibre1">computronium is real bad idea, long-term. Who knows how far has gone</p>
<p class="calibre1">already?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm, again.” Pierre draws a circle in the air. “Aineko,” he calls,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“are you listening?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t bug me.” A faint green smile appears in the circle, just the</p>
<p class="calibre1">suggestion of fangs and needle-sharp whiskers. “I had an idea I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">sleeping furiously.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boris rolls one turreted eye and drools on the tabletop. “Munch</p>
<p class="calibre1">munch,” he growls, allowing his saurian body-brain to put in a word.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you need to sleep for? This is a fucking sim, in case you</p>
<p class="calibre1">hadn’t noticed.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I enjoy sleeping,” replies the cat, irritably lashing its</p>
<p class="calibre1">just-now-becoming-visible tail. “What do you want? Fleas?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No thanks,” Pierre says hastily. Last time he called Aineko’s bluff</p>
<p class="calibre1">the cat had filled three entire pocket universes with scurrying gray</p>
<p class="calibre1">mice. One of the disadvantages of flying aboard a starship the size of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a baked bean can full of smart matter was the risk that some of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">passengers could get rather too creative with the reality control</p>
<p class="calibre1">system. This Cretaceous kaffee klatsch was just Boris’s entertainment</p>
<p class="calibre1">partition; compared to some of the other simulation spaces aboard the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Field Circus, it was downright conservative. “Look, do you have any</p>
<p class="calibre1">updates on what’s going on downwell? We’re only twenty objective days</p>
<p class="calibre1">out from orbital insertion, and there’s so little to see -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re not sending us power.” Aineko materializes fully now, a large</p>
<p class="calibre1">orange-and-white cat with a swirl of brown fur in the shape on an</p>
<p class="calibre1">@-symbol covering her ribs. For whatever reason, she plants herself on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the table tauntingly close to Boris’s velociraptor body’s nose. “No</p>
<p class="calibre1">propulsion laser means insufficient bandwidth. They’re talking in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Latin-1 text at 1200 baud, if you care to know.” (Which is an insult,</p>
<p class="calibre1">given the ship’s multi-avabit storage capacity - one avabit is</p>
<p class="calibre1">Avogadro’s number of bits; about 1023 bytes, several billion times the</p>
<p class="calibre1">size of the Internet in 2001 - and outrageous communications</p>
<p class="calibre1">bandwidth.) “Amber says, come and see her now. Audience chamber.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Informal, of course. I think she wants to discuss it.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Informal? Am all right without change bodies?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat sniffs. “I’m wearing a real fur coat,” it declares haughtily,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“but no knickers.” Then blinks out a fraction of a second ahead of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">snicker-snack of Bandersnatch-like jaws.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come on,” says Pierre, standing up. “Time to see what Her Majesty</p>
<p class="calibre1">wants with us today.”</p>

<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>

<p class="calibre1">Welcome to decade eight, third millennium, when the effects of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">phase-change in the structure of the solar system are finally</p>
<p class="calibre1">becoming visible on a cosmological scale.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are about eleven billion future-shocked primates in various</p>
<p class="calibre1">states of life and undeath throughout the solar system. Most of</p>
<p class="calibre1">them cluster where the interpersonal bandwidth is hottest, down in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the water zone around old Earth. Earth’s biosphere has been in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">intensive care ward for decades, weird rashes of hot-burning</p>
<p class="calibre1">replicators erupting across it before the World Health Organization</p>
<p class="calibre1">can fix them - gray goo, thylacines, dragons. The last great</p>
<p class="calibre1">transglobal trade empire, run from the arcologies of Hong Kong, has</p>
<p class="calibre1">collapsed along with capitalism, rendered obsolete by a bunch of</p>
<p class="calibre1">superior deterministic resource allocation algorithms collectively</p>
<p class="calibre1">known as Economics 2.0. Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Luna are all well</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the way to disintegration, mass pumped into orbit with energy</p>
<p class="calibre1">stolen from the haze of free-flying thermoelectrics that cluster so</p>
<p class="calibre1">thickly around the solar poles that the sun resembles a fuzzy red</p>
<p class="calibre1">ball of wool the size of a young red giant.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Humans are just barely intelligent tool users; Darwinian</p>
<p class="calibre1">evolutionary selection stopped when language and tool use</p>
<p class="calibre1">converged, leaving the average hairy meme carrier sadly deficient</p>
<p class="calibre1">in smarts. Now the brightly burning beacon of sapience isn’t held</p>
<p class="calibre1">by humans anymore - their cross-infectious enthusiasms have spread</p>
<p class="calibre1">to a myriad of other hosts, several types of which are</p>
<p class="calibre1">qualitatively better at thinking. At last count, there were about a</p>
<p class="calibre1">thousand nonhuman intelligent species in Sol space, split evenly</p>
<p class="calibre1">between posthumans on one side, naturally self-organizing AIs in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the middle, and mammalian nonhumans on the other. The common mammal</p>
<p class="calibre1">neural chassis is easily upgraded to human-style intelligence in</p>
<p class="calibre1">most species that can carry, feed and cool a half kilogram of gray</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter, and the descendants of a hundred ethics-challenged doctoral</p>
<p class="calibre1">theses are now demanding equal rights. So are the unquiet dead; the</p>
<p class="calibre1">panopticon-logged Net ghosts of people who lived recently enough to</p>
<p class="calibre1">imprint their identities on the information age, and the ambitious</p>
<p class="calibre1">theological engineering schemes of the Reformed Tiplerite Church of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Latter-day Saints (who want to emulate all possible human beings in</p>
<p class="calibre1">real time, so that they can have the opportunity to be saved).</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The human memesphere is coming alive, although how long it remains</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognizably human is open to question. The informational density</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the inner planets is visibly converging on Avogadro’s number of</p>
<p class="calibre1">bits per mole, one bit per atom, as the deconstructed dumb matter</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the inner planets (apart from Earth, preserved for now like a</p>
<p class="calibre1">picturesque historic building stranded in an industrial park) is</p>
<p class="calibre1">converted into computronium. And it’s not just the inner system.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The same forces are at work on Jupiter’s moons, and those of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Saturn, although it’ll take thousands of years rather than mere</p>
<p class="calibre1">decades to dismantle the gas giants themselves. Even the entire</p>
<p class="calibre1">solar energy budget isn’t enough to pump Jupiter’s enormous mass to</p>
<p class="calibre1">orbital velocity in less than centuries. The fast-burning primitive</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinkers descended from the African plains apes may have vanished</p>
<p class="calibre1">completely or transcended their fleshy architecture before the</p>
<p class="calibre1">solar Matrioshka brain is finished.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, there’s a party brewing down in Saturn’s well.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan’s lily-pad city floats inside a gigantic and nearly-invisible</p>
<p class="calibre1">sphere in Saturn’s upper atmosphere; a balloon kilometers across with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a shell of fullerene-reinforced diamond below and a hot hydrogen gas</p>
<p class="calibre1">bag above. It’s one of several hundred multimegaton soap bubbles</p>
<p class="calibre1">floating in the sea of turbulent hydrogen and helium that is the upper</p>
<p class="calibre1">atmosphere of Saturn, seeded there by the Society for Creative</p>
<p class="calibre1">Terraforming, subcontractors for the 2074 Worlds’ Fair.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cities are elegant, grown from a conceptual seed a few megawords</p>
<p class="calibre1">long. Their replication rate is slow (it takes months to build a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bubble), but in only a couple of decades, exponential growth will have</p>
<p class="calibre1">paved the stratosphere with human-friendly terrain. Of course, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">growth rate will slow toward the end, as it takes longer to</p>
<p class="calibre1">fractionate the metal isotopes out of the gas giant’s turbid depths,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but before that happens, the first fruits of the robot factories on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ganymede will be pouring hydrocarbons down into the mix. Eventually</p>
<p class="calibre1">Saturn - cloud-top gravity a human-friendly 11 meters per second</p>
<p class="calibre1">squared - will have a planet wide biosphere with nearly a hundred</p>
<p class="calibre1">times the surface area of Earth. And a bloody good thing indeed this</p>
<p class="calibre1">will be, for otherwise, Saturn is no use to anyone except as a fusion</p>
<p class="calibre1">fuel bunker for the deep future when the sun’s burned down.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">This particular lily-pad is carpeted in grass, the hub of the disk</p>
<p class="calibre1">rising in a gentle hill surmounted by the glowering concrete hump of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Boston Museum of Science. It looks curiously naked, shorn of its</p>
<p class="calibre1">backdrop of highways and the bridges of the Charles River - but even</p>
<p class="calibre1">the generous kiloton dumb matter load-outs of the skyhooks that lifted</p>
<p class="calibre1">it into orbit wouldn’t have stretched to bringing its framing context</p>
<p class="calibre1">along with it. Probably someone will knock up a cheap diorama backdrop</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of utility fog, Sirhan thinks, but for now, the museum stands</p>
<p class="calibre1">proud and isolated, a solitary redoubt of classical learning in exile</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the fast-thinking core of the solar system.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Waste of money,” grumbles the woman in black. “Whose stupid idea was</p>
<p class="calibre1">this, anyway?” She jabs the diamond ferrule of her cane at the museum.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s a statement,” Sirhan says absently. “You know the kind, we’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">got so many newtons to burn we can send our cultural embassies</p>
<p class="calibre1">wherever we like. The Louvre is on its way to Pluto, did you hear</p>
<p class="calibre1">that?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Waste of energy.” She lowers her cane reluctantly and leans on it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pulls a face: “It’s not right.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You grew up during the second oil crunch, didn’t you?” Sirhan prods.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What was it like then?”</p>

<p class="calibre1">“What was it …? Oh, gas hit fifty bucks a gallon, but we still had</p>
<p class="calibre1">plenty for bombers,” she says dismissively. “We knew it would be okay.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If it hadn’t been for those damn’ meddlesome posthumanists -” Her</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrinkled, unnaturally aged face scowls at him furiously from</p>
<p class="calibre1">underneath hair that has faded to the color of rotten straw, but he</p>
<p class="calibre1">senses a subtext of self-deprecating irony that he doesn’t understand.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like your grandfather, damn him. If I was young again I’d go and piss</p>
<p class="calibre1">on his grave to show him what I think of what he did. If he has a</p>
<p class="calibre1">grave,” she adds, almost fondly.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Memo checkpoint: log family history, Sirhan tells one of his ghosts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As a dedicated historian, he records every experience routinely, both</p>
<p class="calibre1">before it enters his narrative of consciousness - efferent signals are</p>
<p class="calibre1">the cleanest - and also his own stream of selfhood, against some</p>
<p class="calibre1">future paucity of memory. But his grandmother has been remarkably</p>
<p class="calibre1">consistent over the decades in her refusal to adapt to the new</p>
<p class="calibre1">modalities.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re recording this, aren’t you?” she sniffs.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not recording it, Grandmama,” he says gently, “I’m just</p>
<p class="calibre1">preserving my memories for future generations.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hah! We’ll see,” she says suspiciously. Then she surprises him with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bark of laughter, cut off abruptly: “No, you’ll see, darling. I won’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">be around to be disappointed.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you going to tell me about my grandfather?” asks Sirhan.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why should I bother? I know you posthumans, you’ll just go and ask</p>
<p class="calibre1">his ghost yourself. Don’t try to deny it! There are two sides to every</p>
<p class="calibre1">story, child, and he’s had more than his fair share of ears, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sleazebag. Leaving me to bring up your mother on my own, and nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">but a bunch of worthless intellectual property and a dozen lawsuits</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the Mafiya to do it with. I don’t know what I ever saw in him.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan’s voice-stress monitor detects a distinct hint of untruth in</p>
<p class="calibre1">this assertion. “He’s worthless trash, and don’t you forget it. Lazy</p>
<p class="calibre1">idiot couldn’t even form just one startup on his own: He had to give</p>
<p class="calibre1">it all away, all the fruits of his genius.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">While she rambles on, occasionally punctuating her characterization</p>
<p class="calibre1">with sharp jabs of the cane, Pamela leads Sirhan on a slow, wavering</p>
<p class="calibre1">stroll that veers around one side of the museum, until they’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">standing next to a starkly engineered antique loading bay. “He should</p>
<p class="calibre1">have tried real communism instead,” she harrumphs: “Put some steel</p>
<p class="calibre1">into him, shake those starry-eyed visionary positive-sum daydreams</p>
<p class="calibre1">loose. You knew where you were in the old times, and no mistake.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Humans were real humans, work was real work, and corporations were</p>
<p class="calibre1">just things that did as we told them. And then, when she went to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bad, that was all his fault, too, you know.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She? You mean my, ah, mother?” Sirhan diverts his primary sensorium</p>
<p class="calibre1">back to Pamela’s vengeful muttering. There are aspects to this story</p>
<p class="calibre1">that he isn’t completely familiar with, angles he needs to sketch in</p>
<p class="calibre1">so that he can satisfy himself that all is as it should be when the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bailiffs go in to repossess Amber’s mind.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He sent her our cat. Of all the mean-spirited, low, downright</p>
<p class="calibre1">dishonest things he ever did, that was the worst part of it. That cat</p>
<p class="calibre1">was mine, but he reprogrammed it to lead her astray. And it succeeded</p>
<p class="calibre1">admirably. She was only twelve at the time, an impressionable age, I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">sure you’d agree. I was trying to raise her right. Children need moral</p>
<p class="calibre1">absolutes, especially in a changing world, even if they don’t like it</p>
<p class="calibre1">much at the time. Self-discipline and stability, you can’t function as</p>
<p class="calibre1">an adult without them. I was afraid that, with all her upgrades, she’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">never really get a handle on who she was, that she’d end up more</p>
<p class="calibre1">machine than woman. But Manfred never really understood childhood,</p>
<p class="calibre1">mostly on account of his never growing up. He always was inclined to</p>
<p class="calibre1">meddle.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell me about the cat,” Sirhan says quietly. One glance at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">loading bay door tells him that it’s been serviced recently. A thin</p>
<p class="calibre1">patina of expended foglets have formed a snowy scab around its edges,</p>
<p class="calibre1">flaking off like blue refractive candyfloss that leaves bright metal</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind. “Didn’t it go missing or something?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pamela snorts. “When your mother ran away, it uploaded itself to her</p>
<p class="calibre1">starwhisp and deleted its body. It was the only one of them that had</p>
<p class="calibre1">the guts - or maybe it was afraid I’d have it subpoenaed as a hostile</p>
<p class="calibre1">witness. Or, and I can’t rule this out, your grandfather gave it a</p>
<p class="calibre1">suicide reflex. He was quite evil enough to do something like that,</p>
<p class="calibre1">after he reprogrammed himself to think I was some kind of mortal</p>
<p class="calibre1">enemy.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So when my mother died to avoid bankruptcy, the cat … didn’t stay</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind? Not at all? How remarkable.” Sirhan doesn’t bother adding how</p>
<p class="calibre1">suicidal. Any artificial entity that’s willing to upload its neural</p>
<p class="calibre1">state vector into a one-kilogram interstellar probe three-quarters of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the way to Alpha Centauri without backup or some clear way of</p>
<p class="calibre1">returning home has got to be more than a few methods short in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">object factory.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s a vengeful beast.” Pamela pokes her stick at the ground sharply,</p>
<p class="calibre1">mutters a command word, and lets go of it. She stands before Sirhan,</p>
<p class="calibre1">craning her neck back to look up at him. “My, what a tall boy you</p>
<p class="calibre1">are.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Person,” he corrects, instinctively. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">presume.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Person, thing, boy, whatever - you’re engendered, aren’t you?” she</p>
<p class="calibre1">asks, sharply, waiting until he nods reluctantly. “Never trust anyone</p>
<p class="calibre1">who can’t make up their mind whether to be a man or a woman,” she says</p>
<p class="calibre1">gloomily. “You can’t rely on them.” Sirhan, who has placed his</p>
<p class="calibre1">reproductive system on hold until he needs it, bites his tongue. “That</p>
<p class="calibre1">damn cat,” his grandmother complains. “It carried your grandfather’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">business plan to my daughter and spirited her away into the big black.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It poisoned her against me. It encouraged her to join in that frenzy</p>
<p class="calibre1">of speculative bubble-building that caused the market reboot that</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought down the Ring Imperium. And now it -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is it on the ship?” Sirhan asks, almost too eagerly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It might be.” She stares at him through narrowed eyes. “You want to</p>
<p class="calibre1">interview it, too, huh?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan doesn’t bother denying it. “I’m a historian, Grandmama. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">that probe has been somewhere no other human sensorium has ever seen.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It may be old news, and there may be old lawsuits waiting to feed on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the occupants, but …” He shrugs. “Business is business, and my</p>
<p class="calibre1">business lies in ruins.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hah!” She stares at him for a moment, then nods, very slowly. She</p>
<p class="calibre1">leans forward to rest both wrinkled hands atop her cane, joints like</p>
<p class="calibre1">bags of shriveled walnuts: Her suit’s endoskeleton creaks as it</p>
<p class="calibre1">adjusts to accommodate her confidential posture. “You’ll get yours,</p>
<p class="calibre1">kid.” The wrinkles twist into a frightening smile, sixty years of</p>
<p class="calibre1">saved-up bitterness finally within spitting distance of a victim. “And</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ll get what I want, too. Between us, your mother won’t know what’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">hit her.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Relax, between us your mother won’t know what’s hit her,” says the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cat, baring needle teeth at the Queen in the big chair - carved out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a single lump of computational diamond, her fingers clenched whitely</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the sapphire-plated arms - her minions, lovers, friends, crew,</p>
<p class="calibre1">shareholders, bloggers, and general factional auxiliaries spaced out</p>
<p class="calibre1">around her. And the Slug. “It’s just another lawsuit. You can deal</p>
<p class="calibre1">with it.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fuck ‘em if they can’t take a joke,” Amber says, a trifle moodily.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Although she’s ruler of this embedded space, with total control over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the reality model underlying it, she’s allowed herself to age to a</p>
<p class="calibre1">dignified twentysomething: Dressed casually in gray sweats, she</p>
<p class="calibre1">doesn’t look like the once-mighty ruler of a Jovian moon, or for that</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter the renegade commander of a bankrupt interstellar expedition.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay, I think you’d better run that past me again. Unless anyone’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">got any suggestions?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you will excuse me?” asks Sadeq. “We have a shortage of insight</p>
<p class="calibre1">here. I believe two laws were cited as absolute systemwide conventions</p>
<p class="calibre1">- and how they convinced the ulama to go along with that I would very</p>
<p class="calibre1">much like to know - concerning the rights and responsibilities of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">undead. Which, apparently, we are. Did they by any chance attach the</p>
<p class="calibre1">code to their claim?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do bears shit in woods?” asks Boris, raptor-irascible, with an angry</p>
<p class="calibre1">clatter of teeth. “Is full dependency graph and parse tree of criminal</p>
<p class="calibre1">code crawling way up carrier’s ass as we speak. Am drowning in lawyer</p>
<p class="calibre1">gibberish! If you -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Boris, can it!” Amber snaps. Tempers are high in the throne room. She</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t know what to expect when she arrived home from the expedition</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the router, but bankruptcy proceedings weren’t part of it. She</p>
<p class="calibre1">doubts any of them expected anything like this. Especially not the bit</p>
<p class="calibre1">about being declared liable for debts run up by a renegade splinter of</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself, her own un-uploaded identity that had stayed home to face the</p>
<p class="calibre1">music, aged in the flesh, married, gone bankrupt, died - incurred</p>
<p class="calibre1">child support payments? “I don’t hold you responsible for this,” she</p>
<p class="calibre1">added through gritted teeth, with a significant glance toward Sadeq.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is truly a mess fit for the Prophet himself, peace be unto him,</p>
<p class="calibre1">to serve judgment upon.” Sadeq looks as shaken as she is by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">implications the lawsuit raises. His gaze skitters around the room,</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking anywhere but at Amber - and Pierre, her lanky toy-boy</p>
<p class="calibre1">astrogator and bed warmer - as he laces his fingers.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Drop it. I said I don’t blame you.” Amber forces a smile. “We’re all</p>
<p class="calibre1">tense from being locked in here with no bandwidth. Anyway, I smell</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mother-dearest’s hand underneath all this litigation. Sniff the glove.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We’ll sort a way out.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We could keep going.” This from Ang, at the back of the room.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Diffident and shy, she doesn’t generally open her mouth without a good</p>
<p class="calibre1">reason. “The Field Circus is in good condition, isn’t it? We could</p>
<p class="calibre1">divert back to the beam from the router, accelerate up to cruise</p>
<p class="calibre1">speed, and look for somewhere to live. There must be a few suitable</p>
<p class="calibre1">brown dwarfs within a hundred light-years …”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve lost too much sail mass,” says Pierre. He’s not meeting Amber’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">gaze either. There are lots of subtexts loose in this room, broken</p>
<p class="calibre1">narratives from stories of misguided affections. Amber pretends not to</p>
<p class="calibre1">notice his embarrassment. “We ejected half our original launch sail to</p>
<p class="calibre1">provide the braking mirror at Hyundai +4904/[-56], and almost eight</p>
<p class="calibre1">megaseconds ago, we halved our area again to give us a final</p>
<p class="calibre1">deceleration beam for Saturn orbit. If we did it again, we wouldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">have enough area left to repeat the trick and still decelerate at our</p>
<p class="calibre1">final target.” Laser-boosted light sails do it with mirrors; after</p>
<p class="calibre1">boost, they can drop half the sail and use it to reverse the launch</p>
<p class="calibre1">beam and direct it back at the ship, to provide deceleration. But you</p>
<p class="calibre1">can only do it a few times before you run out of sail. “There’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">nowhere to run.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nowhere to -” Amber stares at him through narrowed eyes. “Sometimes I</p>
<p class="calibre1">really wonder about you, you know?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know you do.” And Pierre really does know, because he carries a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little homunculoid around in his society of mind, a model of Amber far</p>
<p class="calibre1">more accurate and detailed than any pre-upload human could possibly</p>
<p class="calibre1">have managed to construct of a lover. (For her part, Amber keeps a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little Pierre doll tucked away inside the creepy cobwebs of her head,</p>
<p class="calibre1">part of an exchange of insights they took part in years ago. But she</p>
<p class="calibre1">doesn’t try to fit inside his head too often anymore - it’s not good</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be able to second-guess your lover every time.) “I also know that</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re going to rush in and grab the bull by the, ah, no. Wrong</p>
<p class="calibre1">metaphor. This is your mother we are discussing?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My mother.” Amber nods thoughtfully. “Where’s Donna?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s a throaty roar from the back, and Boris lurches forward with</p>
<p class="calibre1">something in his mouth, an angry Bolex that flails his snout with its</p>
<p class="calibre1">tripod legs. “Hiding in corners again?” Amber says disdainfully.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am a camera!” protests the camera, aggrieved and self-conscious as</p>
<p class="calibre1">it picks itself up off the floor. “I am -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre leans close, sticks his face up against the fish-eye lens:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re fucking well going to be a human being just this once. Merde!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The camera is replaced by a very annoyed blond woman wearing a safari</p>
<p class="calibre1">suit and more light meters, lenses, camera bags, and microphones than</p>
<p class="calibre1">a CNN outside broadcast unit. “Go fuck yourself!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t like being spied on,” Amber says sharply. “Especially as you</p>
<p class="calibre1">weren’t invited to this meeting. Right?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m the archivist.” Donna looks away, stubbornly refusing to admit</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything. “You said I should -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, well.” Amber is embarrassed. But it’s a bad idea to embarrass</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Queen in her audience chamber. “You heard what we were discussing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">What do you know about my mother’s state of mind?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Absolutely nothing,” Donna says promptly. She’s clearly in a sulk and</p>
<p class="calibre1">prepared to do no more than the minimum to help resolve the situation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I only met her once. You look like her when you are angry, do you</p>
<p class="calibre1">know that?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I -” For once, Amber’s speechless.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll schedule you for facial surgery,” offers the cat. Sotto voce:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s the only way to be sure.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Normally, accusing Amber of any resemblance to her mother, however</p>
<p class="calibre1">slight and passing, would be enough to trigger a reality quake within</p>
<p class="calibre1">the upload environment that passes for the bridge of the Field Circus.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s a sign of how disturbed Amber is by the lawsuit that she lets the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cat’s impertinence slide. “What is the lawsuit, anyway?” Donna asks,</p>
<p class="calibre1">nosy as ever and twice as annoying: “I did not that bit see.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s horrible,” Amber says vehemently.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Truly evil,” echoes Pierre.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fascinating but wrong,” Sadeq muses thoughtfully.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But it’s still horrible!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, but what is it?” Donna the all-seeing-eye archivist and camera</p>
<p class="calibre1">manqu� asks.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s a demand for settlement.” Amber takes a deep breath. “Dammit,</p>
<p class="calibre1">you might as well tell everyone - it won’t stay secret for long.” She</p>
<p class="calibre1">sighs. “After we left, it seems my other half - my original</p>
<p class="calibre1">incarnation, that is - got married. To Sadeq, here.” She nods at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Iranian theologian, who looks just as bemused as she did the first</p>
<p class="calibre1">time she heard this part of the story. “And they had a child. Then the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ring Imperium went bankrupt. The child is demanding maintenance</p>
<p class="calibre1">payments from me, backdated nearly twenty years, on the grounds that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the undead are jointly and severally liable for debts run up by their</p>
<p class="calibre1">incarnations. It’s a legal precedent established to prevent people</p>
<p class="calibre1">from committing suicide temporarily as a way to avoid bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Worse, the lien on my assets is measured in subjective time from a</p>
<p class="calibre1">point at the Ring Imperium about nineteen months after our launch time</p>
<p class="calibre1">- we’ve been in relativistic flight, so while my other half would be</p>
<p class="calibre1">out from under it by now if she’d survived, I’m still subject to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">payment order. But compound interest applies back home - that is to</p>
<p class="calibre1">stop people trying to use the twin’s paradox as a way to escape</p>
<p class="calibre1">liability. So, by being away for about twenty-eight years of</p>
<p class="calibre1">wall-clock time, I’ve run up a debt I didn’t know about to enormous</p>

<p class="calibre1">cutlery and fine porcelain plates setting out two places at opposite</p>

<p class="calibre1">perplexity.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I had several. Mother kept hitting the reset switch, hoping I’d turn</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was the only way she knew to raise a child,” Sirhan says</p>
<p class="calibre1">defensively. “She didn’t have any siblings. And, perhaps, she was</p>

<p class="calibre1">adequate means to find himself a bride, and adequate emotional</p>
<p class="calibre1">maturity to activate his organs of procreation. A creature of extreme</p>
<p class="calibre1">caution, Sirhan is not planning to repeat the errors of his ancestors</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the maternal side.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pamela flinches: “it’s not my fault,” she says quietly. “Her father</p>
<p class="calibre1">had quite a bit to do with that. But what - what different childhoods</p>
<p class="calibre1">did you have?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, a fair number. There was the default option, with Mother and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Father arguing constantly - she refused to take the veil and he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">too stiff-necked to admit he was little more than a kept man, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">between them, they were like two neutron stars locked in an unstable</p>
<p class="calibre1">death spiral of gravity. Then there were my other lives, forked and</p>
<p class="calibre1">reintegrated, running in parallel. I was a young goatherd in the days</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the middle kingdom in Egypt, I remember that; and I was an</p>
<p class="calibre1">all-American kid growing up in Iowa in the 1950s, and another me got</p>
<p class="calibre1">to live through the return of the hidden imam - at least, his parents</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought it was the hidden imam - and -” Sirhan shrugs. “Perhaps that’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">where I acquired my taste for history.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did your parents ever consider making you a little girl?” asks his</p>
<p class="calibre1">grandmother.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mother suggested it a couple of times, but Father forbade it.” Or</p>
<p class="calibre1">rather, decided it was unlawful, he recalls. “I had a very</p>
<p class="calibre1">conservative upbringing in some ways.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wouldn’t say that. When I was a little girl, that was all there</p>
<p class="calibre1">was; none of these questions of self-selected identity. There was no</p>
<p class="calibre1">escape, merely escapism. Didn’t you ever have a problem knowing who</p>
<p class="calibre1">you were?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The starters arrive, diced melon on a silver salver. Sirhan waits</p>
<p class="calibre1">patiently for his grandmama to chivvy the table into serving her. “The</p>
<p class="calibre1">more people you are, the more you know who you are,” says Sirhan. “You</p>
<p class="calibre1">learn what it’s like to be other people. Father thought that perhaps</p>
<p class="calibre1">it isn’t good for a man to know too much about what it’s like to be a</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman.” And Grandfather disagreed, but you already know that, he adds</p>
<p class="calibre1">for his own stream of consciousness.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I couldn’t agree more.” Pamela smiles at him, an expression that</p>
<p class="calibre1">might be that of a patronizing elder aunt if it wasn’t for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">alarming sharkishness of her expression - or is it playfulness? Sirhan</p>
<p class="calibre1">covers his confusion by spooning chunks of melon into his mouth,</p>
<p class="calibre1">forking temporary ghosts to peruse dusty etiquette manuals and warn</p>
<p class="calibre1">him if he’s about to commit some faux pas. “So, how did you enjoy your</p>
<p class="calibre1">childhoods?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Enjoy isn’t a word I would use,” he replies as evenly as he can,</p>
<p class="calibre1">laying down his spoon so he doesn’t spill anything. As if childhood is</p>
<p class="calibre1">something that ever ends, he thinks bitterly. Sirhan is considerably</p>
<p class="calibre1">less than a gigasecond old and confidently expects to exist for at</p>
<p class="calibre1">least a terasecond - if not in exactly this molecular configuration,</p>
<p class="calibre1">then at least in some reasonably stable physical incarnation. And he</p>
<p class="calibre1">has every intention of staying young for that entire vast span - even</p>
<p class="calibre1">into the endless petaseconds that might follow, although by then,</p>
<p class="calibre1">megayears hence, he speculates that issues of neoteny will no longer</p>
<p class="calibre1">interest him. “It’s not over yet. How about you? Are you enjoying your</p>
<p class="calibre1">old age, Grandmama?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pamela almost flinches, but keeps iron control of her expression. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">flush of blood in the capillaries of her cheeks, visible to Sirhan</p>
<p class="calibre1">through the tiny infrared eyes he keeps afloat in the air above the</p>
<p class="calibre1">table, gives her away. “I made some mistakes in my youth, but I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">enjoying it fine nowadays,” she says lightly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s your revenge, isn’t it?” Sirhan asks, smiling and nodding as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">table removes the entrees.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why, you little -” She stares at him rather than continuing. A very</p>
<p class="calibre1">bleak stare it is, too. “What would you know about revenge?” she asks.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m the family historian.” Sirhan smiles humorlessly. “I lived from</p>
<p class="calibre1">two to seventeen years several hundred times over before my eighteenth</p>
<p class="calibre1">birthday. It was that reset switch, you know. I don’t think Mother</p>
<p class="calibre1">realized my primary stream of consciousness was journaling</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s monstrous.” Pamela picks up her wineglass and takes a sip to</p>
<p class="calibre1">cover her confusion. Sirhan has no such retreat - grape juice in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">tumbler, unfermented, wets his tongue. “I’d never do something like</p>
<p class="calibre1">that to any child of mine.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So why won’t you tell me about your childhood?” asks her grandson.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“For the family history, of course.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll -” She puts her glass down. “You intend to write one,” she</p>
<p class="calibre1">states.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m thinking about it.” Sirhan sits up. “An old-fashioned book</p>
<p class="calibre1">covering three generations, living through interesting times,” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">suggests. “A work of postmodern history, the incoherent school at that</p>
<p class="calibre1">- how do you document people who fork their identities at random,</p>
<p class="calibre1">spend years dead before reappearing on the stage, and have arguments</p>
<p class="calibre1">with their own relativistically preserved other copy? I could trace</p>
<p class="calibre1">the history further, of course - if you tell me about your parents,</p>
<p class="calibre1">although I am certain they aren’t around to answer questions directly</p>
<p class="calibre1">- but we reach the boring dumb matter slope back to the primeval soup</p>
<p class="calibre1">surprisingly fast if we go there, don’t we? So I thought that perhaps</p>
<p class="calibre1">as a narrative hook I’d make the offstage viewpoint that of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">family’s robot cat. (Except the bloody thing’s gone missing, hasn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">it?) Anyway, with so much of human history occupying the untapped</p>
<p class="calibre1">future, we historians have our work cut out recording the cursor of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the present as it logs events. So I might as well start at home.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re set on immortalism.” Pamela studies his face.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” he says idly. “Frankly, I can understand your wanting to grow</p>
<p class="calibre1">old out of a desire for revenge, but pardon me for saying this, I have</p>
<p class="calibre1">difficulty grasping your willingness to follow through with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">procedure! Isn’t it awfully painful?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Growing old is natural,” growls the old woman. “When you’ve lived</p>
<p class="calibre1">long enough for all your ambitions to be in ruins, friendships broken,</p>
<p class="calibre1">lovers forgotten or divorced acrimoniously, what’s left to go on for?</p>
<p class="calibre1">If you feel tired and old in spirit, you might as well be tired and</p>
<p class="calibre1">old in body. Anyway, wanting to live forever is immoral. Think of all</p>
<p class="calibre1">the resources you’re taking up that younger people need! Even uploads</p>
<p class="calibre1">face a finite data storage limit after a time. It’s a monstrously</p>
<p class="calibre1">egotistical statement, to say you intend to live forever. And if</p>
<p class="calibre1">there’s one thing I believe in, it’s public service. Duty: the</p>
<p class="calibre1">obligation to make way for the new. Duty and control.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan absorbs all this, nodding slowly to himself as the table serves</p>
<p class="calibre1">up the main course - honey-glazed roast long pork with saut�ed</p>
<p class="calibre1">potatoes a la gratin and carrots Debussy - when there’s a loud bump</p>
<p class="calibre1">from overhead.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s that?” Pamela asks querulously.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One moment.” Sirhan’s vision splits into a hazy kaleidoscope view of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the museum hall as he forks ghosts to monitor each of the ubiquitous</p>
<p class="calibre1">cameras. He frowns; something is moving on the balcony, between the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mercury capsule and a display of antique random-dot stereoisograms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh dear. Something seems to be loose in the museum.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Loose? What do you mean, loose?” An inhuman shriek splits the air</p>
<p class="calibre1">above the table, followed by a crash from upstairs. Pamela stands up</p>
<p class="calibre1">unsteadily, wiping her lips with her napkin. “Is it safe?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, it isn’t safe.” Sirhan fumes. “It’s disturbing my meal!” He looks</p>
<p class="calibre1">up. A flash of orange fur shows over the balcony, then the Mercury</p>
<p class="calibre1">capsule wobbles violently on the end of its guy wires. Two arms and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bundle of rubbery something covered in umber hair lurches out from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">handrail and casually grabs hold of the priceless historical relic,</p>
<p class="calibre1">then clambers inside and squats on top of the dummy wearing Al</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sheperd’s age-cracked space suit. “It’s an ape! City, I say, City!</p>
<p class="calibre1">What’s a monkey doing loose in my dinner party?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am most deeply sorry, sir, but I don’t know. Would sir care to</p>
<p class="calibre1">identify the monkey in question?” replies City, which for reasons of</p>
<p class="calibre1">privacy, has manifested itself as a bodiless voice.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s a note of humor in City’s tone that Sirhan takes deep</p>
<p class="calibre1">exception to. “What do you mean? Can’t you see it?” he demands,</p>
<p class="calibre1">focusing on the errant primate, which is holed up in the Mercury</p>
<p class="calibre1">capsule dangling from the ceiling, smacking its lips, rolling its</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes, and fingering the gasket around the capsule’s open hatch. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">hoots quietly to itself, then leans out of the open door and moons</p>
<p class="calibre1">over the table, baring its buttocks. “Get back!” Sirhan calls to his</p>
<p class="calibre1">grandmother, then he gestures at the air above the table, intending to</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell the utility fog to congeal. Too late. The ape farts thunderously,</p>
<p class="calibre1">then lets rip a stream of excrement across the dining table. Pamela’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">face is a picture of wrinkled disgust as she holds her napkin in front</p>
<p class="calibre1">of her nose. “Dammit, solidify, will you!” Sirhan curses, but the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ubiquitous misty pollen-grain-sized robots refuse to respond.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s your problem? Invisible monkeys?” asks City.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Invisible -” he stops.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can’t you see what it did?” Pamela demands, backing him up. “It just</p>
<p class="calibre1">defecated all over the main course!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I see nothing,” City says uncertainly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here, let me help you.” Sirhan lends it one of his eyes, rolls it to</p>
<p class="calibre1">focus on the ape, which is now reaching lazy arms around the hatch and</p>
<p class="calibre1">patting down the roof of the capsule, as if hunting for the wires’</p>
<p class="calibre1">attachment points.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh dear,” says City, “I’ve been hacked. That’s not supposed to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well it fucking is,” hisses Pamela.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hacked?” Sirhan stops trying to tell the air what to do and focuses</p>
<p class="calibre1">on his clothing instead. Fabric reweaves itself instantly, mapping</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself into an armored airtight suit that raises a bubble visor from</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind his neck and flips itself shut across his face. “City please</p>
<p class="calibre1">supply my grandmama with an environment suit now. Make it completely</p>
<p class="calibre1">autonomous.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The air around Pamela begins to congeal in a blossom of crystalline</p>
<p class="calibre1">security, as a sphere like a giant hamster ball precipitates out</p>
<p class="calibre1">around her. “If you’ve been hacked, the first question is, who did</p>
<p class="calibre1">it,” Sirhan states. “The second is ‘why,’ and the third is ‘how.’” He</p>
<p class="calibre1">edgily runs a self-test, but there’s no sign of inconsistencies in his</p>
<p class="calibre1">own identity matrix, and he has hot shadows sleeping lightly at</p>
<p class="calibre1">scattered nodes across as distance of half a dozen light-hours. Unlike</p>
<p class="calibre1">pre-posthuman Pamela, he’s effectively immune to murder-simple. “If</p>
<p class="calibre1">this is just a prank -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seconds have passed since the orangutan got loose in the museum, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">subsequent seconds have passed since City realized its bitter</p>
<p class="calibre1">circumstance. Seconds are long enough for huge waves of</p>
<p class="calibre1">countermeasures to sweep the surface of the lily-pad habitat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Invisibly small utility foglets are expanding and polymerizing into</p>
<p class="calibre1">defenses throughout the air, trapping the thousands of itinerant</p>
<p class="calibre1">passenger pigeons in midflight, and locking down every building and</p>
<p class="calibre1">every person who walks the paths outside. City is self-testing its</p>
<p class="calibre1">trusted computing base, starting with the most primitive secured</p>
<p class="calibre1">kernel and working outward. Meanwhile Sirhan, with blood in his eye,</p>
<p class="calibre1">heads for the staircase, with the vague goal of physically attacking</p>
<p class="calibre1">the intruder. Pamela retreats at a fast roll, tumbling toward the</p>
<p class="calibre1">safety of the mezzanine floor and a garden of fossils. “Who do you</p>
<p class="calibre1">think you are, barging in and shitting on my supper?” Sirhan yells as</p>
<p class="calibre1">he bounds up the stairs. “I want an explanation! Right now!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The orangutan finds the nearest cable and gives it a yank, setting</p>
<p class="calibre1">the one-ton capsule swinging. It bares its teeth at Sirhan in a grin.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Remember me?” it asks, in a sibilant French accent.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Remember -” Sirhan stops dead. “Tante Annette? What are you doing in</p>
<p class="calibre1">that orangutan?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Having minor autonomic control problems.” The ape grimaces wider,</p>
<p class="calibre1">then bends one arm sinuously and scratches at its armpit. “I am sorry,</p>
<p class="calibre1">I installed myself in the wrong order. I was only meaning to say hello</p>
<p class="calibre1">and pass on a message.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What message?” Sirhan demands. “You’ve upset my grandmama, and if she</p>
<p class="calibre1">finds out you’re here -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She won’t; I’ll be gone in a minute.” The ape - Annette - sits up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your grandfather salutes you and says he will be visiting shortly. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">the person, that is. He is very keen to meet your mother and her</p>
<p class="calibre1">passengers. That is all. Have you a message for him?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t he dead?” Sirhan asks, dazed.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No more than I am. And I’m overdue. Good day!” The ape swings hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">over hand out of the capsule, then lets go and plummets ten meters to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the hard stone floor below. Its skull makes a noise like a hard-boiled</p>
<p class="calibre1">egg impacting concrete.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh dear,” Sirhan breathes heavily. “City!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, oh master?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Remove that body,” he says, pointing over the balcony. “I’ll trouble</p>
<p class="calibre1">you not to disturb my grandmother with any details. In particular,</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t tell her it was Annette. The news may upset her.” The perils of</p>
<p class="calibre1">having a long-lived posthuman family, he thinks; too many mad aunts in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the space capsule. “If you can find a way to stop Auntie ‘Nette from</p>
<p class="calibre1">growing any more apes, that might be a good idea.” A thought strikes</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. “By the way, do you know when my grandfather is due to arrive?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your grandfather?” asks City: “Isn’t he dead?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan looks over the balcony, at the blood-seeping corpse of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">intruder. “Not according to his second wife’s latest incarnation.”</p>

<p class="calibre1">Funding the family reunion isn’t going to be a problem, as Amber</p>
<p class="calibre1">discovers when she receives an offer of reincarnation good for all the</p>
<p class="calibre1">passengers and crew of the Field Circus.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She isn’t sure quite where the money is coming from. Presumably it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">some creaky financial engine designed by Dad, stirring from its</p>
<p class="calibre1">bear-market bunker for the first time in decades to suck dusty</p>
<p class="calibre1">syndication feeds and liquidate long-term assets held against her</p>
<p class="calibre1">return. She’s duly grateful - even fervently so - for the details of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her own impecunious position grow more depressing the more she learns</p>
<p class="calibre1">about them. Her sole asset is the Field Circus, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">thirty-years-obsolete starwhisp massing less than twenty kilograms</p>
<p class="calibre1">including what’s left of its tattered sail, along with its cargo of</p>
<p class="calibre1">uploaded passengers and crew. Without the farsighted trust fund that</p>
<p class="calibre1">has suddenly chugged into life, she’d be stranded in the realm of</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever-circling leptons. But now the fund has sent her its offer of</p>
<p class="calibre1">incarnation, she’s got a dilemma. Because one of the Field Circus’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">passengers has never actually had a meatspace body …</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber finds the Slug browsing quietly in a transparent space filled</p>
<p class="calibre1">with lazily waving branches that resemble violet coral fans. They’re a</p>
<p class="calibre1">ghost-memory of alien life, an order of thermophilic quasi fungi with</p>
<p class="calibre1">hyphae ridged in actin/myosin analogues, muscular and slippery filter</p>
<p class="calibre1">feeders that eat airborne unicellular organisms. The Slug itself is</p>
<p class="calibre1">about two meters long and has a lacy white exoskeleton of curves and</p>
<p class="calibre1">arcs that don’t repeat, disturbingly similar to a Penrose tiling.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chocolate brown organs pulse slowly under the skeleton. The ground</p>
<p class="calibre1">underfoot is dry but feels swampy.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Actually, the Slug is a surgical disguise. Both it and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">quasi-fungal ecosystem have been extinct for millions of years,</p>
<p class="calibre1">existing only as cheap stage props in an interstellar medicine show</p>
<p class="calibre1">run by rogue financial instruments. The Slug itself is one such</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-aware scam, probably a pyramid scheme or even an entire</p>
<p class="calibre1">compressed junk bond market in heavy recession, trying to hide from</p>
<p class="calibre1">its creditors by masquerading as a life-form. But there’s a problem</p>
<p class="calibre1">with incarnating itself down in Sirhan’s habitat - the ecosystem it</p>
<p class="calibre1">evolved for is a cool Venusiform, thirty atmospheres of saturated</p>
<p class="calibre1">steam baked under a sky the color of hot lead streaked with yellow</p>
<p class="calibre1">sulphuric acid clouds. The ground is mushy because it’s melting, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">because it’s damp.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re going to have to pick another somatotype,” Amber explains,</p>
<p class="calibre1">laboriously rolling her interface around the red-hot coral reef like a</p>
<p class="calibre1">giant soap bubble. The environmental interface is transparent and</p>
<p class="calibre1">infinitely thin, a discontinuity in the physics model of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">simulation space, mapping signals between the human-friendly</p>
<p class="calibre1">environment on one side and the crushing, roasting hell on the other.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“This one is simply not compatible with any of the supported</p>
<p class="calibre1">environments where we’re going.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am not understanding. Surely I can integrate with the available</p>
<p class="calibre1">worlds of our destination?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh, things don’t work that way outside cyberspace.” Suddenly Amber is</p>
<p class="calibre1">at a bit of a loss. “The physics model could be supported, but the</p>
<p class="calibre1">energy input to do so would be prohibitive, and you would not be able</p>
<p class="calibre1">to interact as easily with other physics models as we can now.” She</p>
<p class="calibre1">forks a ghost, demonstrates a transient other-Amber in a refrigerated</p>
<p class="calibre1">tank rolling across the Slug’s backyard, crushing coral and hissing</p>
<p class="calibre1">and clanking noisily. “You’d be like this.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your reality is badly constructed, then,” the Slug points out.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not constructed at all, it just evolved, randomly.” Amber</p>
<p class="calibre1">shrugs. “We can’t exercise the same level of control over the</p>
<p class="calibre1">underlying embedded context that we can over this one. I can’t simply</p>
<p class="calibre1">magic you an interface that will let you bathe in steam at three</p>
<p class="calibre1">hundred degrees.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why not?” asks the Slug. Translation wetware adds a nasty, sharp</p>
<p class="calibre1">rising whine to the question, turning it into a demand.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s a privilege violation,” Amber tries to explain. “The reality</p>
<p class="calibre1">we’re about to enter is, uh, provably consistent. It has to be,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because it’s consistent and stable, and if we could create new local</p>
<p class="calibre1">domains with different rules, they might propagate uncontrollably.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s not a good idea, believe me. Do you want to come with us or not?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have no alternative,” the Slug says, slightly sulkily. “But do you</p>
<p class="calibre1">have a body I can use?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think -” Amber stops, suddenly. She snaps her fingers. “Hey, cat!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">A Cheshire grin ripples into view, masked into the domain wall between</p>
<p class="calibre1">the two embedded realities. “Hey, human.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Whoa!” Amber takes a backward step from the apparition. “Our friend</p>
<p class="calibre1">here’s got a problem, no suitable downloadable body. Us meat puppets</p>
<p class="calibre1">are all too closely tied to our neural ultrastructure, but you’ve got</p>
<p class="calibre1">a shitload of programmable gate arrays. Can we borrow some?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can do better than that.” Aineko yawns, gathering substance by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the moment. The Slug is rearing up and backing away like an alarmed</p>
<p class="calibre1">sausage: Whatever it perceives in the membrane seems to frighten it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve been designing myself a new body. I figured it was time to</p>
<p class="calibre1">change my style for a while. Your corporate scam artist here can</p>
<p class="calibre1">borrow my old template until something better comes up. How’s that?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you hear that?” Amber asks the Slug. “Aineko is kindly offering</p>
<p class="calibre1">to donate her body to you. Will that do?” Without waiting, she winks</p>
<p class="calibre1">at her cat and taps her heels together, fading out with a whisper and</p>
<p class="calibre1">a smile: “See you on the other side …”</p>

<p class="calibre1">It takes several minutes for the Field Circus’s antique transceiver to</p>
<p class="calibre1">download the dozens of avabits occupied by the frozen state vectors of</p>
<p class="calibre1">each of the people running in its simulation engines. Tucked away with</p>
<p class="calibre1">most of them is a resource bundle consisting of their entire sequenced</p>
<p class="calibre1">genome, a bunch of phenotypic and proteome hint markers, and a wish</p>
<p class="calibre1">list of upgrades. Between the gene maps and the hints, there’s enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">data to extrapolate a meat machine. So the festival city’s body shop</p>
<p class="calibre1">goes to work turning out hacked stem cells and fabbing up incubators.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">It doesn’t take very long to reincarnate a starshipful of</p>
<p class="calibre1">relativity-lagged humans these days. First, City carves out skeletons</p>
<p class="calibre1">for them (politely ignoring a crudely phrased request to cease and</p>
<p class="calibre1">desist from Pamela, on the grounds that she has no power of attorney),</p>
<p class="calibre1">then squirts osteoclasts into the spongy ersatz bone. They look like</p>
<p class="calibre1">ordinary human stem cells at a distance, but instead of nuclei they</p>
<p class="calibre1">have primitive pinpricks of computronium, blobs of smart matter so</p>
<p class="calibre1">small they’re as dumb as an ancient Pentium, reading a control tape</p>
<p class="calibre1">that is nevertheless better structured than anything Mother Nature</p>
<p class="calibre1">evolved. These heavily optimized fake stem cells - biological robots</p>
<p class="calibre1">in all but name - spawn like cancer, ejecting short-lived anucleated</p>
<p class="calibre1">secondary cells. Then City infuses each mess of quasi-cancerous tissue</p>
<p class="calibre1">with a metric shitload of carrier capsids, which deliver the real</p>
<p class="calibre1">cellular control mechanisms to their target bodies. Within a</p>
<p class="calibre1">megasecond, the almost random churning of the construction ‘bots gives</p>
<p class="calibre1">way to a more controlled process as nanoscale CPUs are replaced by</p>
<p class="calibre1">ordinary nuclei and eject themselves from their host cells, bailing</p>
<p class="calibre1">out via the half-formed renal system - except for those in the central</p>
<p class="calibre1">nervous system, which have a final job to do. Eleven days after the</p>

<p class="calibre1">Sirhan doesn’t pay much attention to the pseudocancers fermenting and</p>
<p class="calibre1">churning in the row of tanks that lines the Gallery of the Human Body</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the Bush wing of the museum. Newly formed, slowly unskeletonizing</p>
<p class="calibre1">corpses - like a time-lapse process of decay with a finger angrily</p>
<p class="calibre1">twisting the dial into high-speed reverse - is both distasteful and</p>
<p class="calibre1">aesthetically displeasing to watch. Nor do the bodies tell him</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything about their occupants. This sort of stuff is just a necessary</p>
<p class="calibre1">prequel to the main event, a formal reception and banquet to which he</p>
<p class="calibre1">has devoted the full-time attention of four ghosts.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He could, given a few less inhibitions, go Dumpster-diving in their</p>
<p class="calibre1">mental archives, but that’s one of the big taboos of the post-wetware</p>
<p class="calibre1">age. (Spy agencies went meme-profiling and memory-mining in the third</p>
<p class="calibre1">and fourth decades, gained a thought police rap sheet, and spawned a</p>
<p class="calibre1">backlash of deviant mental architectures resilient to infowar</p>
<p class="calibre1">intrusions. Now the nations that those spook institutions served no</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer exist, their very landmasses being part of the orbiting</p>
<p class="calibre1">n�osphere construction project that will ultimately turn the mass of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the entire solar system into a gigantic Matrioshka brain. And Sirhan</p>
<p class="calibre1">is left with an uneasy loyalty to the one great new taboo to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">invented since the end of the twentieth century - freedom of thought.)</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, to indulge his curiosity, he spends most of his waking fleshbody</p>
<p class="calibre1">hours with Pamela, asking her questions from time to time and mapping</p>
<p class="calibre1">the splenetic overspill of her memeome into his burgeoning family</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge base.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wasn’t always this bitter and cynical,” Pamela explains, waving her</p>
<p class="calibre1">cane in the vague direction of the cloudscape beyond the edge of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">world and fixing Sirhan with a beady stare. (He’s brought her out here</p>
<p class="calibre1">hoping that it will trigger another cascade of memories, sunsets on</p>
<p class="calibre1">honeymoon island resorts and the like, but all that seems to be coming</p>
<p class="calibre1">up is bile.) “It was the successive betrayals. Manfred was the first,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the worst in some ways, but that little bitch Amber hurt me more,</p>
<p class="calibre1">if anything. If you ever have children, be careful to hold something</p>
<p class="calibre1">back for yourself; because if you don’t, when they throw it all in</p>
<p class="calibre1">your face, you’ll feel like dying. And when they’re gone, you’ve got</p>
<p class="calibre1">no way of patching things up.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is dying inevitable?” asks Sirhan, knowing damn well that it isn’t,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but more than happy to give her an excuse to pick at her scabbed-over</p>
<p class="calibre1">love wound: He more than half suspects she’s still in love with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred. This is great family history, and he’s having the time of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">flinty-hearted life leading her up to the threshold of the reunion</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’s hosting.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sometimes I think death is even more inevitable than taxes,” his</p>
<p class="calibre1">grandmother replies bleakly. “Humans don’t live in a vacuum; we’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">part of a larger pattern of life.” She stares out across the</p>
<p class="calibre1">troposphere of Saturn, where a thin rime of blown methane snow catches</p>
<p class="calibre1">the distant sunrise in a ruby-tinted fog. “The old gives way to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">new,” She sighs, and tugs at her cuffs. (Ever since the incident with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the gate crashing ape, she’s taken to wearing an antique formal</p>
<p class="calibre1">pressure suit, all clinging black spidersilk woven with flexible pipes</p>
<p class="calibre1">and silvery smart sensor nets.) “There’s a time to get out of the way</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the new, and I think I passed it sometime ago.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um,” says Sirhan, who is somewhat surprised by this new angle in her</p>
<p class="calibre1">lengthy, self-justifying confession: “but what if you’re just saying</p>
<p class="calibre1">this because you feel old? If it’s just a physiological malfunction,</p>
<p class="calibre1">we could fix it and you’d -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No! I’ve got a feeling that life prolongation is morally wrong,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan. I’m not passing judgment on you, just stating that I think</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s wrong for me. It’s immoral because it blocks up the natural</p>
<p class="calibre1">order, keeps us old cobweb strands hanging around and getting in you</p>
<p class="calibre1">young things’ way. And then there are the theological questions. If</p>
<p class="calibre1">you try to live forever, you never get to meet your maker.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your maker? Are you a theist, then?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I - think so.” Pamela is silent for a minute. “Although there are so</p>
<p class="calibre1">many different approaches to the subject that it’s hard to know which</p>
<p class="calibre1">version to believe. For a long time, I was secretly afraid your</p>
<p class="calibre1">grandfather might actually have had the answers. That I might have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been wrong all along. But now -” She leans on her cane. “When he</p>
<p class="calibre1">announced that he was uploading, I figured out that all he really had</p>
<p class="calibre1">was a life-hating antihuman ideology he’d mistaken for a religion. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">rapture of the nerds and the heaven of the AIs. Sorry, no thanks; I</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t buy it.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh.” Sirhan squints out at the cloudscape. For a moment, he thinks he</p>
<p class="calibre1">can see something in the distant mist, an indeterminate distance away</p>
<p class="calibre1">- it’s hard to distinguish centimeters from megameters, with no scale</p>
<p class="calibre1">indicator and a horizon a continental distance away - but he’s not</p>
<p class="calibre1">sure what it is. Maybe another city, mollusk-curved and sprouting</p>
<p class="calibre1">antennae, a strange tail of fabricator nodes wavering below and</p>
<p class="calibre1">beneath it. Then a drift of cloud hides it for a moment, and, when it</p>
<p class="calibre1">clears the object is gone. “What’s left, then? If you don’t really</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe in some kind of benign creator, dying must be frightening.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Especially as you’re doing it so slowly.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pamela smiles skeletally, a particularly humorless expression. “It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">perfectly natural, darling! You don’t need to believe in God to</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe in embedded realities. We use them every day, as mind tools.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Apply anthropic reasoning and isn’t it clear that our entire universe</p>
<p class="calibre1">is probably a simulation? We’re living in the early epoch of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">universe. Probably this” - she prods at the spun-diamond inner wall of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the bubble that holds in the precarious terrestrial atmosphere,</p>
<p class="calibre1">holding out the howling cryogenic hydrogen and methane gales of Saturn</p>
<p class="calibre1">- “is but a simulation in some ancient history engine’s panopticon,</p>
<p class="calibre1">rerunning the sum of all possible origins of sentience, a billion</p>
<p class="calibre1">trillion megayears down the line. Death will be like waking up as</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone bigger, that’s all.” Her grin slides away. “And if not, I’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">just be a silly old fool who deserves the oblivion she yearns for.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, but -” Sirhan stops, his skin crawling. She may be mad, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">realizes abruptly. Not clinically insane, just at odds with the entire</p>
<p class="calibre1">universe. Locked into a pathological view of her own role in reality.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d hoped for a reconciliation,” he says quietly. “Your extended</p>
<p class="calibre1">family has lived through some extraordinary times. Why spoil it with</p>
<p class="calibre1">acrimony?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why spoil it?” She looks at him pityingly: “It was spoiled to begin</p>
<p class="calibre1">with, dear, too much selfless sacrifice and too little skepticism. If</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred hadn’t wanted so badly not to be human, and if I’d learned to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be a bit more flexible in time, we might still -” She trails off.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s odd.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pamela raises her cane and points out into the billowing methane</p>
<p class="calibre1">thunderclouds, her expression puzzled. “I’ll swear I saw a lobster out</p>
<p class="calibre1">there …”</p>

<p class="calibre1">Amber awakens in the middle of the night in darkness and choking</p>
<p class="calibre1">pressure, and senses that she’s drowning. For a moment she’s back in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the ambiguous space on the far side of the router, a horror of</p>
<p class="calibre1">crawling instruments tracing her every experience back to the nooks</p>
<p class="calibre1">and crannies of her mind; then her lungs turn to glass and shatter,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and she’s coughing and wheezing in the cold air of the museum at</p>
<p class="calibre1">midnight.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The hard stone floor beneath her, and an odd pain in her knees, tells</p>
<p class="calibre1">her that she’s not aboard the Field Circus anymore. Rough hands hold</p>
<p class="calibre1">her shoulders up as she vomits a fine blue mist, racked by a coughing</p>
<p class="calibre1">fit. More bluish liquid is oozing from the pores of the skin on her</p>
<p class="calibre1">arms and breasts, evaporating in strangely purposeful streamers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you,” she finally manages to gasp: “I can breathe now.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She sits back on her heels, realizes she’s naked, and opens her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything’s confusingly strange, even though it shouldn’t be. There’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">a moment of resistance as if her eyelids are sealed - then they</p>
<p class="calibre1">respond. It all feels strangely familiar to her, like waking up again</p>
<p class="calibre1">inside a house she grew up in and moved away from years ago. But the</p>
<p class="calibre1">scene around her is hardly one to inspire confidence. Shadows lie</p>
<p class="calibre1">thick and deep across ovoid tanks filled with an anatomist’s dream,</p>
<p class="calibre1">bodies in various nightmarish stages of assembly. And sitting in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">middle of them, whence it has retreated after letting go of her</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulders, is a strangely misshapen person - also nude, but for a</p>
<p class="calibre1">patchy coat of orange hair.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you awake yet, ma ch�rie?” asks the orangutan.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um.” Amber shakes her head, cautiously, feeling the drag of damp</p>
<p class="calibre1">hair, the faint caress of a breeze - she reaches out with another</p>
<p class="calibre1">sense and tries to grab hold of reality, but it slithers away,</p>
<p class="calibre1">intransigent and unembedded. Everything around her is so solid and</p>
<p class="calibre1">immutable that, for a moment, she feels a stab of claustrophobic</p>
<p class="calibre1">panic: Help! I’m trapped in the real universe! Another quick check</p>
<p class="calibre1">reassures her that she’s got access to something outside her own head,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the panic begins to subside: Her exocortex has migrated</p>
<p class="calibre1">successfully to this world. “I’m in a museum? On Saturn? Who are you -</p>
<p class="calibre1">have we met?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not in person,” the ape says carefully. “We ‘ave corresponded.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette Dimarcos.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Auntie -” A flood of memories rattle Amber’s fragile stream of</p>
<p class="calibre1">consciousness apart, forcing her to fork repeatedly until she can drag</p>
<p class="calibre1">them together. Annette, in a recorded message: Your father sends you</p>
<p class="calibre1">this escape package. The legal key to her mother’s gilded custodial</p>
<p class="calibre1">cage. Freedom a necessity. “Is Dad here?” she asks hopefully, even</p>
<p class="calibre1">though she knows full well that here in the real world at least</p>
<p class="calibre1">thirty-five years have passed in linear time: In a century where ten</p>
<p class="calibre1">years of linear time is enough for several industrial revolutions,</p>
<p class="calibre1">that’s a lot of water under the bridge.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am not sure.” The orangutan blinks lazily, scratches at her left</p>
<p class="calibre1">forearm, and glances round the chamber. “He might be in one of these</p>
<p class="calibre1">tanks, playing a shell game. Or he might be leaving well enough alone</p>
<p class="calibre1">until the dust settles.” She turns back to stare at Amber with big,</p>
<p class="calibre1">brown, soulful eyes. “This is not to be the reunion you were hoping</p>
<p class="calibre1">for.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not -” Amber takes a deep breath, the tenth or twelfth that these new</p>
<p class="calibre1">lungs have inspired: “What’s with the body? You used to be human. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">what’s going on?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I still am human, where it counts,” says Annette. “I use these bodies</p>
<p class="calibre1">because they are good in low gravity, and they remind me that</p>
<p class="calibre1">meatspace is no longer where I live. And for another reason.” She</p>
<p class="calibre1">gestures fluidly at the open door. “You will find big changes. Your</p>
<p class="calibre1">son has organized -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My son.” Amber blinks. “Is this the one who’s suing me? Which version</p>
<p class="calibre1">of me? How long ago?” A torrent of questions stream through her mind,</p>
<p class="calibre1">exploding out into structured queries throughout the public sections</p>
<p class="calibre1">of mindspace that she has access to. Her eyes widen as she absorbs the</p>
<p class="calibre1">implications. “Oh shit! Tell me she isn’t here already!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am very much afraid that she is,” says Annette. “Sirhan is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">strange child: He takes after his grandm�re. Who he, of course,</p>
<p class="calibre1">invited to his party.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“His party?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why, yes! Hasn’t he told you what this is about? It’s his party. To</p>
<p class="calibre1">mark the opening of his special institution. The family archive. He’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">setting the lawsuit aside, at least for the duration. That’s why</p>
<p class="calibre1">everybody is here - even me.” The ape-body smirks at her: “I’m afraid</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’s rather disappointed by my dress.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell me about this library,” Amber says, narrowing her eyes. “And</p>
<p class="calibre1">about this son of mine whom I’ve never met, by a father I’ve never</p>
<p class="calibre1">fucked.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What, you would know everything?” asks Annette.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.” Amber pushes herself creakily upright. “I need some clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And soft furniture. And where do I get a drink around here?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll show you,” says the orangutan, unfolding herself in a vertical</p>
<p class="calibre1">direction like a stack of orange furry inner tubes. “Drinks, first.”</p>

<p class="calibre1">While the Boston Museum of Science is the main structure on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lily-pad habitat, it’s not the only one: just the stupidest, composed</p>
<p class="calibre1">of dumb matter left over from the pre-enlightened age. The orangutan</p>
<p class="calibre1">leads Amber through a service passage and out into the temperate</p>
<p class="calibre1">night, naked by ringlight. The grass is cool beneath her feet, and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">gentle breeze blows constantly out toward the recirculators at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">edge of the worldlet. She follows the slouching orange ape up a grassy</p>
<p class="calibre1">slope, under a weeping willow, round a three-hundred-and-ninety-degree</p>
<p class="calibre1">bend that flashes the world behind them into invisibility, and into a</p>

<p class="calibre1">heap of mist. “Make a chair,” she says. It solidifies, gaining form</p>
<p class="calibre1">and texture until a creditable Queen Anne reproduction stands in front</p>
<p class="calibre1">of Amber on spindly legs. “And one for me. Skin up, pick one of my</p>
<p class="calibre1">favorite themes.” The walls recede slightly and harden, extruding</p>
<p class="calibre1">paint and wood and glass. “That’s it.” The ape grins at Amber. “You</p>

<p class="calibre1">“You can never tell with future shock.” Annette shrugs and reaches a</p>
<p class="calibre1">limber arm around the back of her neck to scratch. “We are utility fog</p>
<p class="calibre1">using, for most purposes out here, peer-to-peer meshes of multiarmed</p>
<p class="calibre1">assemblers that change conformation and vapor/solid phase at command.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Texture and color are all superfice, not reality. But yes, this came</p>
<p class="calibre1">from one of your mother’s letters to your father. She brought it here,</p>
<p class="calibre1">for you to surprise. If only it is ready in time.” Lips pull back from</p>
<p class="calibre1">big, square, foliage-chewing teeth in something that might be a smile</p>
<p class="calibre1">in a million years’ time.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You, I - I wasn’t expecting. This.” Amber realizes she’s breathing</p>
<p class="calibre1">rapidly, a near-panic reflex. The mere proximity of her mother is</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough to give her unpleasant reactions. Annette is all right, Annette</p>
<p class="calibre1">is cool. And her father is the trickster-god, always hiding in your</p>
<p class="calibre1">blind spot to leap out and shower you with ambiguous gifts. But Pamela</p>
<p class="calibre1">tried to mold Amber in her own image as a child; and despite all the</p>
<p class="calibre1">traveling she’s done since then, and all the growing up, Amber harbors</p>
<p class="calibre1">an unreasonable claustrophobic fear of her mother.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t be unhappy,” Annette says warmly. “I this you show to convince</p>
<p class="calibre1">you, she will try to disturb you. It is a sign of weakness, she lacks</p>
<p class="calibre1">the courage of her convictions.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She does?” This is news to Amber, who leans forward to listen.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. She is an old and bitter woman, now. The years have not been</p>
<p class="calibre1">easy for her. She perhaps intends to use her unrepaired senescence as</p>
<p class="calibre1">a passive suicide weapon by which to hold us blameworthy, inflicting</p>
<p class="calibre1">guilt for her mistreatment, but she is afraid of dying all the same.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Your reaction, should it be unhappy, will excuse and encourage her</p>
<p class="calibre1">selfishness. Sirhan colludes, unknowing, the idiot child. He thinks</p>
<p class="calibre1">the universe of her and thinks by helping her die he is helping her</p>
<p class="calibre1">achieve her goals. He has never met an adult walking backward toward a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cliff before.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Backward.” Amber takes a deep breath. “You’re telling me Mom is so</p>
<p class="calibre1">unhappy she’s trying to kill herself by growing old? Isn’t that a bit</p>
<p class="calibre1">slow?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette shakes her head lugubriously. “She’s had fifty years to</p>
<p class="calibre1">practice. You have been away twenty-eight years! She was thirty when</p>
<p class="calibre1">she bore you. Now she is over eighty, and a telomere refusenik, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">charter member of the genome conservation front. To accept a slow</p>
<p class="calibre1">virus purge and aging reset would be to lay down a banner she has</p>
<p class="calibre1">carried for half a century. To accept uploading, that, too, is wrong</p>
<p class="calibre1">in her mind: She will not admit her identity is a variable, not a</p>
<p class="calibre1">constant. She came out here in a can, frozen, with more radiation</p>
<p class="calibre1">damage. She is not going back home. This is where she plans to end her</p>
<p class="calibre1">days. Do you see? That is why you were brought here. That, and because</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the bailiffs who have bought title to your other self’s business</p>
<p class="calibre1">debts. They are waiting for you in Jupiter system with warrants and</p>
<p class="calibre1">headsuckers to extract your private keys.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s cornered me!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, I would not say that. We all change our convictions sometime or</p>
<p class="calibre1">other, perhaps. She is inflexible, she will not bend; but she is not</p>
<p class="calibre1">stupid. Nor is she as vindictive as perhaps she herself believes. She</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinks she must a scorned woman be, even though there is more to her</p>
<p class="calibre1">than that. Your father and I, we -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is he still alive?” Amber demands eagerly, half-anxious to know,</p>
<p class="calibre1">half-wishing she could be sure the news won’t be bad.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” Annette grins again, but it’s not a happy expression, more a</p>
<p class="calibre1">baring of teeth at the world. “As I was saying, your father and I, we</p>
<p class="calibre1">have tried to help her. Pamela denies him. He is, she says, not a man.</p>
<p class="calibre1">No more so am I myself a woman? No, but she’ll still talk to me. You</p>
<p class="calibre1">will do better. But his assets, they are spent. He is not a rich man</p>
<p class="calibre1">this epoch, your father.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, but.” Amber nods to herself. “He may be able to help me.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh? How so?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You remember the original goal of the Field Circus? The sapient alien</p>
<p class="calibre1">transmission?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, of course.” Annette snorts. “Junk bond pyramid schemes from</p>
<p class="calibre1">credulous saucer wisdom airheads.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber licks her lips. “How susceptible to interception are we here?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here?” Annette glances round. “Very. You can’t maintain a habitat in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a nonbiosphere environment without ubiquitous surveillance.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, then …”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber dives inward, forks her identity, collects a complex bundle of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her thoughts and memories, marshals them, offers Annette one end of an</p>
<p class="calibre1">encryption tunnel, then stuffs the frozen mindstorm into her head.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette sits still for approximately ten seconds, then shudders and</p>
<p class="calibre1">whimpers quietly. “You must ask your father,” she says, growing</p>
<p class="calibre1">visibly agitated. “I must leave, now. I should not have known that! It</p>
<p class="calibre1">is dynamite, you see. Political dynamite. I must return to my primary</p>
<p class="calibre1">sister-identity and warn her.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your - wait!” Amber stands up as fast as her ill-coordinated body</p>
<p class="calibre1">will let her, but Annette is moving fast, swarming up a translucent</p>
<p class="calibre1">ladder in the air.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell Manfred!” calls her aunt through the body of an ape: “Trust no</p>
<p class="calibre1">one else!” She throws another packet of compressed, encrypted memories</p>
<p class="calibre1">down the tunnel to Amber; then, a moment later, the orange skull</p>
<p class="calibre1">touches the ceiling and dissolves, a liquid flow of dissociating</p>
<p class="calibre1">utility foglets letting go of one another and dispersing into the</p>
<p class="calibre1">greater mass of the building that spawned the fake ape.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Snapshots from the family album: While you were gone …</p>
<p class="calibre1">* Amber, wearing a brocade gown and a crown encrusted with diamond</p>
<p class="calibre1">processors and external neural taps, her royal party gathered</p>
<p class="calibre1">around her, attends the pan-Jovian constitutional conference with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the majesty of a confirmed head of state and ruler of a small</p>
<p class="calibre1">inner moon. She smiles knowingly at the camera viewpoint, with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">professional shine that comes from a good public relations video</p>
<p class="calibre1">filter. “We are very happy to be here,” she says, “and we are</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleased that the commission has agreed to lend its weight to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">continued progress of the Ring Imperium’s deep-space program.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">* A piece of dumb paper, crudely stained with letters written in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">faded brown substance - possibly blood - says “I’m checking out,</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t delta me.” This version of Pierre didn’t go to the router:</p>
<p class="calibre1">He stayed at home, deleted all his backups, and slit his wrists,</p>
<p class="calibre1">his epitaph sharp and self-inflicted. It comes as a cold shock,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the first chill gust of winter’s gale blowing through the outer</p>
<p class="calibre1">system’s political elite. And it’s the start of a regime of</p>
<p class="calibre1">censorship directed toward the already speeding starwhisp: Amber,</p>
<p class="calibre1">in her grief, makes an executive decision not to tell her embassy</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the stars that one of them is dead and, therefore, unique.</p>
<p class="calibre1">* Manfred - fifty, with the fashionably pale complexion of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">digerati, healthy-looking for his age, standing beside a</p>
<p class="calibre1">transmigration bush with a stupid grin on his face. He’s decided</p>
<p class="calibre1">to take the final step, not simply to spawn external mental</p>
<p class="calibre1">processes running in an exocortex of distributed processors, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">to move his entire persona right out of meatspace, into wherever</p>
<p class="calibre1">it is that the uploads aboard the Field Circus have gone. Annette,</p>
<p class="calibre1">skinny, elegant, and very Parisian, stands beside him, looking as</p>
<p class="calibre1">uncertain as the wife of a condemned man.</p>
<p class="calibre1">* A wedding, shi’ite, Mut’ah - of limited duration. It’s scandalous</p>
<p class="calibre1">to many, but the mamtu’ah isn’t moslem, she wears a crown instead</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a veil, and her groom is already spoken of in outraged terms by</p>
<p class="calibre1">most other members of the trans-Martian Islamic clergy. Besides</p>
<p class="calibre1">which, in addition to being in love, the happy couple have more</p>
<p class="calibre1">strategic firepower than a late-twentieth-century superpower.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Their cat, curled at their feet, looks smug: She’s the custodian</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the permissive action locks on the big lasers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">* A speck of ruby light against the darkness - red-shifted almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">into the infrared, it’s the return signal from the Field Circus’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">light sail as the starwhisp passes the one-light-year mark, almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">twelve trillion kilometers out beyond Pluto. (Although how can you</p>
<p class="calibre1">call it a starwhisp when it masses almost a hundred kilograms,</p>
<p class="calibre1">including propulsion module? Starwhisps are meant to be tiny!)</p>
<p class="calibre1">* Collapse of the trans-Lunar economy: Deep in the hot thinking</p>
<p class="calibre1">depths of the solar system, vast new intellects come up with a new</p>
<p class="calibre1">theory of wealth that optimizes resource allocation better than</p>
<p class="calibre1">the previously pervasive Free Market 1.0. With no local minima to</p>
<p class="calibre1">hamper them, and no need to spawn and reap startups Darwin-style,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the companies, group minds, and organizations that adopt the</p>
<p class="calibre1">so-called Accelerated Salesman Infrastructure of Economics 2.0</p>
<p class="calibre1">trade optimally with each other. The phase change accelerates as</p>
<p class="calibre1">more and more entities join in, leveraging network externalities</p>
<p class="calibre1">to overtake the traditional ecosystem. Amber and Sadeq are late on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the train, Sadeq obsessing about how to reconcile ASI with</p>
<p class="calibre1">murabaha and mudaraba while the postmodern economy of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mid-twenty-first century disintegrates around them. Being late has</p>
<p class="calibre1">punitive consequences - the Ring Imperium has always been a net</p>
<p class="calibre1">importer of brainpower and a net exporter of gravitational</p>
<p class="calibre1">potential energy. Now it’s a tired backwater, the bit rate from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the red-shifted relativisitic probe insufficiently delightful to</p>
<p class="calibre1">obsess the daemons of industrial routing. In other words, they’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">poor.</p>
<p class="calibre1">* A message from beyond the grave: The travelers aboard the starship</p>
<p class="calibre1">have reached their destination, an alien artifact drifting in</p>
<p class="calibre1">chilly orbit around a frozen brown dwarf. Recklessly they upload</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves into it, locking the starwhisp down for years of sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber and her husband have few funds with which to pay for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">propulsion lasers: what they have left of the kinetic energy of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Ring Imperium - based on the orbital momentum of a small</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jovian inner moon - is being sapped, fast, at a near-loss, by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">crude requirements of the exobionts and metanthropes who fork and</p>
<p class="calibre1">spawn in the datasphere of the outer Jovians. The cost of</p>
<p class="calibre1">importing brains to the Ring Imperium is steep: In near-despair</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber and Sadeq produce a child, Generation 3.0, to populate their</p>
<p class="calibre1">dwindling kingdom. Picture the cat, offended, lashing its tail</p>
<p class="calibre1">beside the zero-gee crib.</p>
<p class="calibre1">* Surprise and postcards from the inner orbitals - Amber’s mother</p>
<p class="calibre1">offers to help. For the sake of the child, Sadeq offers bandwidth</p>
<p class="calibre1">and user interface enrichment. The child forks, numerous times, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber despairingly plays with probabilities, simulating upbringing</p>
<p class="calibre1">outcomes. Neither she nor Sadeq are good parents - the father</p>
<p class="calibre1">absentminded and prone to lose himself in the intertextual</p>
<p class="calibre1">deconstruction of surahs, the mother ragged-edged from running the</p>
<p class="calibre1">economy of a small and failing kingdom. In the space of a decade,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan lives a dozen lives, discarding identities like old</p>
<p class="calibre1">clothes. The uncertainty of life in the decaying Ring Imperium</p>
<p class="calibre1">does not entrance him, his parents’ obsessions annoy him, and when</p>
<p class="calibre1">his grandmother offers to fund his delta vee and subsequent</p>
<p class="calibre1">education in one of the orbitals around Titan, his parents give</p>
<p class="calibre1">their reluctant assent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">* Amber and Sadeq separate acrimoniously. Sadeq, studies abandoned</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the face of increasing intrusions from the world of what is</p>
<p class="calibre1">into the universe of what should be, joins a spacelike sect of</p>
<p class="calibre1">sufis, encysted in a matrix of vitrification nanomechs out in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Oort cloud to await a better epoch. His instrument of will - the</p>
<p class="calibre1">legal mechanism of his resurrection - specifies that he is waiting</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the return of the hidden, twelfth imam.</p>
<p class="calibre1">* For her part, Amber searches the inner system briefly for word of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her father - but there’s nothing. Isolated and alone, pursued by</p>
<p class="calibre1">accusing debts, she flings herself into a reborganization,</p>
<p class="calibre1">stripping away those aspects of her personality that have brought</p>
<p class="calibre1">her low; in law, her liability is tied to her identity. Eventually</p>
<p class="calibre1">she donates herself to a commune of also-rans, accepting their</p>
<p class="calibre1">personality in return for a total break with the past.</p>
<p class="calibre1">* Without Queen and consort, the Ring Imperium - now unmanned,</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaking breathing gases, running on autonomic control - slowly</p>
<p class="calibre1">deorbits into the Jovian murk, beaming power to the outer moons</p>
<p class="calibre1">until it punches a hole in the cloud deck in a final incandescent</p>
<p class="calibre1">smear of light, the like of which has not been seen since the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact.</p>
<p class="calibre1">* Sirhan, engrossed in Saturnalia, is offended by his parents’</p>
<p class="calibre1">failure to make more of themselves. And he resolves to do it for</p>
<p class="calibre1">them, if not necessarily in a manner of their liking.</p>

<p class="calibre1">“You see, I am hoping you will help me with my history project,” says</p>
<p class="calibre1">the serious-faced young man.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“History project.” Pierre follows him along the curving gallery, hands</p>
<p class="calibre1">clasped behind his back self-consciously to keep from showing his</p>
<p class="calibre1">agitation: “What history is this?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The history of the twenty-first century,” says Sirhan. “You remember</p>
<p class="calibre1">it, don’t you?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Remember it -” Pierre pauses. “You’re serious?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” Sirhan opens a side door. “This way, please. I’ll explain.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The door opens onto what used to be one of the side galleries of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">museum building, full of interactive exhibits designed to explain</p>
<p class="calibre1">elementary optics to hyperactive children and their indulgent parental</p>
<p class="calibre1">units. Traditional optics are long since obsolete - tunable matter can</p>
<p class="calibre1">slow photons to a stop, teleport them here to there, play ping-pong</p>
<p class="calibre1">with spin and polarization - and besides, the dumb matter in the walls</p>
<p class="calibre1">and floor has been replaced by low-power computronium, heat sinks</p>
<p class="calibre1">dangling far below the floor of the lily-pad habitat to dispose of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">scanty waste photons from reversible computation. Now the room is</p>
<p class="calibre1">empty.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Since I became curator here, I’ve turned the museum’s structural</p>
<p class="calibre1">supports into a dedicated high-density memory store. One of the fringe</p>
<p class="calibre1">benefits of a supervisory post, of course. I have about a billion</p>
<p class="calibre1">avabits of capacity, enough to archive the combined sensory bandwidth</p>
<p class="calibre1">and memories of the entire population of twentieth-century Earth - if</p>
<p class="calibre1">that was what interested me.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Slowly the walls and ceiling are coming to life, brightening,</p>
<p class="calibre1">providing a dizzyingly vibrant view of dawn over the rim wall of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meteor Crater, Arizona - or maybe it’s downtown Baghdad.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Once I realized how my mother had squandered the family fortune, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">spent some time looking for a solution to the problem,” Sirhan</p>
<p class="calibre1">continues. “And it struck me, then, that there’s only one commodity</p>
<p class="calibre1">that is going to appreciate in value as time continues:</p>
<p class="calibre1">reversibility.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Reversibility? That doesn’t make much sense.” Pierre shakes his head.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He still feels slightly dizzy from his decanting. He’s only been awake</p>
<p class="calibre1">an hour or so and is still getting used to the vagaries of a universe</p>
<p class="calibre1">that doesn’t bend its rules to fit his whim of iron - that, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">worrying about Amber, of whom there is no sign in the hall of growing</p>
<p class="calibre1">bodies. “Excuse me, please, but do you know where Amber is?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hiding, probably,” Sirhan says, without rancor. “Her mother’s about,”</p>
<p class="calibre1">he adds. “Why do you ask?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know what you know about us.” Pierre looks at him askance:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“We were aboard the Field Circus for a long time.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, don’t worry on my behalf. I know you’re not the same people who</p>
<p class="calibre1">stayed behind to contribute to the Ring Imperium’s collapse,” Sirhan</p>
<p class="calibre1">says dismissively, while Pierre hastily spawns a couple of ghosts to</p>
<p class="calibre1">search for the history he’s alluding to. What they discover shocks him</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the core as they integrate with his conscious narrative.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We didn’t know about any of that!” Pierre crosses his arms</p>
<p class="calibre1">defensively. “Not about you, or your father either,” he adds quietly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Or my other … life.” Shocked: Did I kill myself? Why would I do a</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing like that? Nor can he imagine what Amber might see in an</p>
<p class="calibre1">introverted cleric like Sadeq; not that he wants to.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sure this must come as a big shock to you,” Sirhan says</p>
<p class="calibre1">condescendingly, “but it’s all to do with what I was talking about.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Reversibility. What does it mean to you, in your precious context? You</p>
<p class="calibre1">are, if you like, an opportunity to reverse whatever ill fortune made</p>
<p class="calibre1">your primary instance autodarwinate himself. He destroyed all the</p>
<p class="calibre1">backups he could get his ghosts to ferret out, you know. Only a</p>
<p class="calibre1">light-year delay line and the fact that as a running instance you’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">technically a different person saved you. And now, you’re alive, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’s dead - and whatever made him kill himself doesn’t apply to you.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Think of it as natural selection among different versions of yourself.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The fittest version of you survives.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He points at the wall of the crater. A tree diagram begins to grow</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the bottom left corner of the wall, recurving and recomplicating</p>
<p class="calibre1">as it climbs toward the top right, zooming and fracturing into</p>
<p class="calibre1">taxonomic fault lines. “Life on Earth, the family tree, what</p>
<p class="calibre1">paleontology has been able to deduce of it for us,” he says pompously.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The vertebrates begin there” - a point three quarters of the way up</p>
<p class="calibre1">the tree - “and we’ve got an average of a hundred fossil samples per</p>
<p class="calibre1">megayear from then on. Most of them collected in the past two decades,</p>
<p class="calibre1">as exhaustive mapping of the Earth’s crust and upper mantle at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">micrometer level has become practical. What a waste.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s” - Pierre does a quick sum - “fifty thousand different</p>
<p class="calibre1">species? Is there a problem?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes!” Sirhan says vehemently, no longer aloof or distant. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">struggles visibly to get himself under control. “At the beginning of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the twentieth century, there were roughly two million species of</p>
<p class="calibre1">vertebrate and an estimated thirty or so million species of</p>
<p class="calibre1">multicellular organisms - it’s hard to apply the same statistical</p>
<p class="calibre1">treatment to prokaryotes, but doubtless there were huge numbers of</p>
<p class="calibre1">them, too. The average life span of a species is about five megayears.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It used to be thought to be about one, but that’s a very</p>
<p class="calibre1">vertebrate-oriented estimate - many insect species are stable over</p>
<p class="calibre1">deep time. Anyway, we have a total sample, from all of history, of</p>
<p class="calibre1">only fifty thousand known prehistoric species - out of a population of</p>
<p class="calibre1">thirty million, turning over every five million years. That is, we</p>
<p class="calibre1">know of only one in a million life-forms, of those that ever existed</p>
<p class="calibre1">on Earth. And the situation with human history is even worse.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aha! So you’re after memoriesy yes? What really happened when we</p>
<p class="calibre1">colonized Barney. Who released Oscar’s toads in the free-fall core of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Ernst Sanger, that sort of thing?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not exactly.” Sirhan looks pained, as if being forced to spell it out</p>
<p class="calibre1">devalues the significance of his insight. “I’m after history. All of</p>
<p class="calibre1">it. I intend to corner the history futures market. But I need my</p>
<p class="calibre1">grandfather’s help - and you’re here to help me get it.”</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over the course of the day, various refugees from the Field Circus</p>
<p class="calibre1">hatch from their tanks and blink in the ringlight, stranded creatures</p>
<p class="calibre1">from an earlier age. The inner system is a vague blur from this</p>
<p class="calibre1">distance, a swollen red cloud masking the sun that rides high above</p>
<p class="calibre1">the horizon. However, the great restructuring is still visible to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">naked eye - here, in the shape of the rings, which show a disturbingly</p>
<p class="calibre1">organized fractal structure as they whirl in orbit overhead. Sirhan</p>
<p class="calibre1">(or whoever is paying for this celebration of family flesh) has</p>
<p class="calibre1">provided for their physical needs: food, water, clothes, housing and</p>
<p class="calibre1">bandwidth, they’re all copiously available. A small town of bubble</p>
<p class="calibre1">homes grows on the grassy knoll adjacent to the museum, utility</p>
<p class="calibre1">foglets condensing in a variety of shapes and styles.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan isn’t the only inhabitant of the festival city, but the others</p>
<p class="calibre1">keep themselves to themselves. Only bourgeois isolationists and</p>
<p class="calibre1">reclusive weirdoes would want to live out here right now, with whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">light-minutes between themselves and the rest of civilization. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">network of lily-pad habitats isn’t yet ready for the Saturnalian</p>
<p class="calibre1">immigration wave that will break upon this alien shore when it’s time</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the Worlds’ Fair, a decade or more in the future. Amber’s flying</p>
<p class="calibre1">circus has driven the native recluses underground, in some cases</p>
<p class="calibre1">literally: Sirhan’s neighbor, Vinca Kovic, after complaining bitterly</p>
<p class="calibre1">about the bustle and noise (“Forty immigrants! An outrage!”), has</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrapped himself in an environment pod and is estivating at the end of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a spidersilk cable a kilometer beneath the space-frame underpinnings</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the city.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But that isn’t going to stop Sirhan from organizing a reception for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the visitors. He’s moved his magnificent dining table outside, along</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the Argentinosaurus skeleton. In fact, he’s built a dining room</p>
<p class="calibre1">within the dinosaur’s rib cage. Not that he’s planning on showing his</p>
<p class="calibre1">full hand, but it’ll be interesting to see how his guests respond. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">maybe it’ll flush out the mystery benefactor who’s been paying for all</p>
<p class="calibre1">these meatbodies.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan’s agents politely invite his visitors to the party as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">second sunset in this day cycle gently darkens the sky to violet. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">discusses his plans with Pamela via antique voice-only phone as his</p>
<p class="calibre1">silent valet dresses him with inhuman grace and efficiency. “I’m sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’ll listen when the situation is made clear to them,” he says. “If</p>
<p class="calibre1">not, well, they’ll soon find out what it means to be paupers under</p>
<p class="calibre1">Economics 2.0. No access to multiplicity, no willpower, to be limited</p>
<p class="calibre1">to purely spacelike resources, at the mercy of predatory borganisms</p>
<p class="calibre1">and metareligions - it’s no picnic out there!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You don’t have the resources to set this up on your own,” his</p>
<p class="calibre1">grandmother points out in dry, didactic tones. “If this was the old</p>
<p class="calibre1">economy, you could draw on the infrastructure of banks, insurers, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">other risk management mechanisms -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s no risk to this venture, in purely human terms,” Sirhan</p>
<p class="calibre1">insists. “The only risk is starting it up with such a limited</p>
<p class="calibre1">reserve.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You win some, you lose some,” Pamela points out. “Let me see you.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">With a sigh, Sirhan waves at a frozen camera; it blinks, surprised.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey, you look good! Every inch the traditional family entrepreneur.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m proud of you, darling.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blinking back an unaccustomed tear of pride, Sirhan nods. “I’ll see</p>
<p class="calibre1">you in a few minutes,” he says, and cuts the call. To the nearest</p>
<p class="calibre1">valet: “Bring my carriage, now.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">A rippling cloud of utility foglets, constantly connecting and</p>
<p class="calibre1">disconnecting in the hazy outline of a 1910-vintage Rolls Royce Silver</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ghost, bears Sirhan silently away from his wing of the museum. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">drives him out onto the sunset path around the building, over to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sunken amphitheatre, where the mounted skeleton of the Argentinosaurus</p>
<p class="calibre1">stands like a half-melted columnar sculpture beneath the</p>
<p class="calibre1">orange-and-silver ringlight. A small crowd of people are already</p>
<p class="calibre1">present, some dressed casually and some attired in the formal garb of</p>
<p class="calibre1">earlier decades. Most of them are passengers or crew recently decanted</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the starwhisp, but a handful are wary-eyed hermits, their body</p>
<p class="calibre1">language defensive and their persons the focus of a constant orbital</p>
<p class="calibre1">hum of security bees. Sirhan dismounts from his silvery car and magics</p>
<p class="calibre1">it into dissolution, a haze of foglets dispersing on the breeze.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome to my abode,” he says, bowing gravely to a ring of interested</p>
<p class="calibre1">faces. “My name is Sirhan al-Khurasani, and I am the prime contractor</p>
<p class="calibre1">in charge of this small corner of the temporary Saturn terraforming</p>
<p class="calibre1">project. As some of you probably know, I am related by blood and</p>
<p class="calibre1">design to your former captain, Amber Macx. I’d like to offer you the</p>
<p class="calibre1">comforts of my home while you acclimatize yourselves to the changed</p>
<p class="calibre1">circumstances prevailing in the system at large and work out where you</p>
<p class="calibre1">want to go next.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He walks toward the front of the U-shaped table of solidified air that</p>
<p class="calibre1">floats beneath the dead dinosaur’s rib cage, slowly turns to take in</p>
<p class="calibre1">faces, and blinks down captions to remind him who’s who in this</p>
<p class="calibre1">gathering. He frowns slightly; there’s no sign of his mother. But that</p>
<p class="calibre1">wiry fellow, with the beard - surely that can’t be - “Father?” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">asks.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sadeq blinks owlishly. “Have we met?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Possibly not.” Sirhan can feel his head spinning, because although</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sadeq looks like a younger version of his father, there’s something</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrong - some essential disconnect: the politely solicitous expression,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the complete lack of engagement, the absence of paternal involvement.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This Sadeq has never held the infant Sirhan in the control core of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ring’s axial cylinder, never pointed out the spiral storm raking vast</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jupiter’s face and told him stories of djinni and marvels to make a</p>
<p class="calibre1">boy’s hair stand on end. “I won’t hold it against you, I promise,” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">blurts.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sadeq raises an eyebrow but passes no comment, leaving Sirhan at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">center of an uncomfortable silence. “Well then,” he says hastily. “If</p>
<p class="calibre1">you would like to help yourselves to food and drink, there’ll be</p>
<p class="calibre1">plenty of time to talk later.” Sirhan doesn’t believe in forking</p>
<p class="calibre1">ghosts simply to interact with other people - the possibilities for</p>
<p class="calibre1">confusion are embarrassing - but he’s going to be busy working the</p>
<p class="calibre1">party.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He glances round. Here’s a bald, aggressive-looking fellow,</p>
<p class="calibre1">beetle-browed, wearing what looks like a pair of cutoffs and a top</p>
<p class="calibre1">made by deconstructing a space suit. Who’s he? (Sirhan’s agents hint:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Boris Denisovitch.” But what does that mean?) There’s an</p>
<p class="calibre1">amused-looking older woman, a beady-eyed camera painted in the violent</p>
<p class="calibre1">colors of a bird of paradise riding her shoulder. Behind her a younger</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman, dressed head to toe in clinging black, her currently ash-blonde</p>
<p class="calibre1">hair braided in cornrows, watches him - as does Pierre, a protective</p>
<p class="calibre1">arm around her shoulders. They’re - Amber Macx? That’s his mother? She</p>
<p class="calibre1">looks far too young, too much in love with Pierre. “Amber!” he says,</p>
<p class="calibre1">approaching the couple.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah? You’re, uh, my mystery child-support litigant?” Her smile is</p>
<p class="calibre1">distinctly unfriendly as she continues: “Can’t say I’m entirely</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleased to meet you, under the circumstances, although I should thank</p>
<p class="calibre1">you for the spread.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I -” His tongue sticks to the roof of his mouth. “It’s not like</p>
<p class="calibre1">that.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s it supposed to be like?” she asks sharply. jabbing a finger at</p>
<p class="calibre1">him: “You know damn well I’m not your mother. So what’s it all about,</p>
<p class="calibre1">huh? You know damn well I’m nearly bankrupt, too, so it’s not as if</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re after my pocket lint. What do you want from me?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her vehemence takes him aback. This sharp-edged aggressive woman isn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">his mother, and the introverted cleric - believer - on the other side</p>
<p class="calibre1">isn’t his father, either. “I ha-ha-had to stop you heading for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">inner system,” he says, speech center hitting deadlock before his</p>
<p class="calibre1">antistutter mod can cut in. “They’ll eat you alive down there. Your</p>
<p class="calibre1">other half left behind substantial debts, and they’ve been bought up</p>
<p class="calibre1">by the most predatory - “</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Runaway corporate instruments,” she states, calmly enough. “Fully</p>
<p class="calibre1">sentient and self-directed.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How did you know?” he asks, worried.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looks grim. “I’ve met them before.” It’s a very familiar grim</p>
<p class="calibre1">expression, one he knows intimately, and that feels wrong coming from</p>
<p class="calibre1">this near stranger. “We visited some weird places, while we were</p>
<p class="calibre1">away.” She glances past him, focuses on someone else, and breathes in</p>
<p class="calibre1">sharply as her face goes blank. “Quickly, tell me what your scheme is.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Before Mom gets here.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mind archiving and history mergers. Back yourself up, pick different</p>
<p class="calibre1">life courses, see which ones work and which don’t - no need to be a</p>
<p class="calibre1">failure, just hit the ‘reload game’ icon and resume. That and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">long-term angle on the history futures market. I need your help,” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">babbles. “It won’t work without family, and I’m trying to stop her</p>
<p class="calibre1">killing herself -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Family.” She nods, guardedly, and Sirhan notices her companion, this</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pierre - not the weak link that broke back before he was born, but a</p>
<p class="calibre1">tough-eyed explorer newly returned from the wilderness - sizing him</p>
<p class="calibre1">up. Sirhan’s got one or two tricks up his exocortex, and he can see</p>
<p class="calibre1">the haze of ghost-shapes around Pierre; his data-mining technique is</p>
<p class="calibre1">crude and out-of-date, but enthusiastic and not without a certain</p>
<p class="calibre1">flair. “Family,” Amber repeats, and it’s like a curse. Louder: “Hello,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mom. Should have guessed he’d have invited you here, too.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Guess again.” Sirhan glances round at Pamela, then back at Amber,</p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly feeling very much like a rat trapped between a pair of angry</p>
<p class="calibre1">cobras. Leaning on her cane, wearing discreet cosmetics and with her</p>
<p class="calibre1">medical supports concealed beneath an old-fashioned dress, Pamela</p>
<p class="calibre1">could be a badly preserved sixtysomething from the old days instead of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the ghastly slow suicide case that her condition amounts to today. She</p>
<p class="calibre1">smiles politely at Amber. “You may remember me telling you that a lady</p>
<p class="calibre1">never unintentionally causes offense. I didn’t want to offend Sirhan</p>
<p class="calibre1">by turning up in spite of his wishes, so I didn’t give him a chance to</p>
<p class="calibre1">say no.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And this is supposed to earn you a sympathy fuck?” Amber drawls. “I’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">expected better of you.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why, you -” The fire in her eyes dies suddenly, subjected to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">freezing pressure of a control that only comes with age. “I’d hoped</p>
<p class="calibre1">getting away from it all would have improved your disposition, if not</p>
<p class="calibre1">your manners, but evidently not.” Pamela jabs her cane at the table:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let me repeat, this is your son’s idea. Why don’t you eat something?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Poison tester goes first.” Amber smiles slyly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For fuck’s sake!” It’s the first thing Pierre has said so far, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">crude or not, it comes as a profound relief when he steps forward,</p>
<p class="calibre1">picks up a plate of water biscuits loaded with salmon caviar, and puts</p>
<p class="calibre1">one in his mouth. “Can’t you guys leave the back stabbing until the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rest of us have filled our stomachs? ‘S not as if I can turn down the</p>
<p class="calibre1">biophysics model in here.” He shoves the plate at Sirhan. “Go on, it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">yours.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The spell is broken. “Thank you,” Sirhan says gravely, taking a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cracker and feeling the tension fall as Amber and her mother stop</p>
<p class="calibre1">preparing to nuke each other and focus on the issue at hand - which is</p>
<p class="calibre1">that food comes before fighting at any social event, not vice versa.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You might enjoy the egg mayonnaise, too,” Sirhan hears himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">saying: “It goes a long way to explaining why the dodo became extinct</p>
<p class="calibre1">first time around.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dodoes.” Amber keeps one eye warily on her mother as she accepts a</p>
<p class="calibre1">plate from a silently gliding silver bush-shaped waitron. “What was</p>
<p class="calibre1">that about the family investment project?” she asks.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just that without your cooperation your family will likely go the way</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the bird,” her mother cuts in before Sirhan can muster a reply.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not that I expect you to care.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boris butts in. “Core worlds are teeming with corporates. Is bad</p>
<p class="calibre1">business for us, good business for them. If you are seeing what we are</p>
<p class="calibre1">seen -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t remember you being there,” Pierre says grumpily.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In any event,” Sirhan says smoothly, “the core isn’t healthy for us</p>
<p class="calibre1">one-time fleshbodies anymore. There are still lots of people there,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but the ones who uploaded expecting a boom economy were sadly</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappointed. Originality is at a premium, and the human neural</p>
<p class="calibre1">architecture isn’t optimized for it - we are, by disposition, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">conservative species, because in a static ecosystem, that provides the</p>
<p class="calibre1">best return on sunk reproductive investment costs. Yes, we change over</p>
<p class="calibre1">time - we’re more flexible than almost any other animal species to</p>
<p class="calibre1">arise on Earth - but we’re like granite statues compared to organisms</p>
<p class="calibre1">adapted to life under Economics 2.0.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You tell ‘em, boy,” Pamela chirps, almost mockingly. “It wasn’t that</p>
<p class="calibre1">bloodless when I lived through it.” Amber casts her a cool stare.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where was I?” Sirhan snaps his fingers, and a glass of fizzy grape</p>
<p class="calibre1">juice appears between them. “Early upload entrepreneurs forked</p>
<p class="calibre1">repeatedly, discovered they could scale linearly to occupy processor</p>
<p class="calibre1">capacity proportional to the mass of computronium available, and that</p>
<p class="calibre1">computationally trivial tasks became tractable. They could also run</p>
<p class="calibre1">faster, or slower, than real time. But they were still human, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">unable to operate effectively outside human constraints. Take a human</p>
<p class="calibre1">being and bolt on extensions that let them take full advantage of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Economics 2.0, and you essentially break their narrative chain of</p>
<p class="calibre1">consciousness, replacing it with a journal file of bid/request</p>
<p class="calibre1">transactions between various agents; it’s incredibly efficient and</p>
<p class="calibre1">flexible, but it isn’t a conscious human being in any recognizable</p>
<p class="calibre1">sense of the word.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All right,” Pierre says slowly. “I think we’ve seen something like</p>
<p class="calibre1">that ourselves. At the router.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan nods, not sure whether he’s referring to anything important.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“So you see, there are limits to human progress - but not to progress</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself! The uploads found their labor to be a permanently deflating</p>
<p class="calibre1">commodity once they hit their point of diminishing utility. Capitalism</p>
<p class="calibre1">doesn’t have a lot to say about workers whose skills are obsolete,</p>
<p class="calibre1">other than that they should invest wisely while they’re earning and</p>
<p class="calibre1">maybe retrain: but just knowing how to invest in Economics 2.0 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">beyond an unaugmented human. You can’t retrain as a seagull, can you,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and it’s quite as hard to retool for Economics 2.0. Earth is -” He</p>
<p class="calibre1">shudders.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s a phrase I used to hear in the old days,” Pamela says calmly,</p>
<p class="calibre1">“ethnic cleansing. Do you know what that means, darling idiot</p>
<p class="calibre1">daughter? You take people who you define as being of little worth, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">first you herd them into a crowded ghetto with limited resources, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">you decide those resources aren’t worth spending on them, and bullets</p>
<p class="calibre1">are cheaper than bread. ‘Mind children’ the extropians called the</p>
<p class="calibre1">posthumans, but they were more like Vile Offspring. There was a lot of</p>
<p class="calibre1">that, during the fast sigmoid phase. Starving among plenty, compulsory</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversions, the very antithesis of everything your father said he</p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted …”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t believe it,” Amber says hotly. “That’s crazy! We can’t go the</p>
<p class="calibre1">way of -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Since when has human history been anything else?” asks the woman with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the camera on her shoulder - Donna, being some sort of public</p>
<p class="calibre1">archivist, is in Sirhan’s estimate likely to be of use to him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Remember what we found in the DMZ?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The DMZ?” Sirhan asks, momentarily confused.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“After we went through the router,” Pierre says grimly. “You tell him,</p>
<p class="calibre1">love.” He looks at Amber.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan, watching him, feels it fall into place at that moment, a sense</p>
<p class="calibre1">that he’s stepped into an alternate universe, one where the woman who</p>
<p class="calibre1">might have been his mother isn’t, where black is white, his kindly</p>
<p class="calibre1">grandmother is the wicked witch of the west, and his feckless</p>
<p class="calibre1">grandfather is a farsighted visionary.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We uploaded via the router,” Amber says, and looks confused for a</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment. “There’s a network on the other side of it. We were told it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was FTL, instantaneous, but I’m not so sure now. I think it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">something more complicated, like a lightspeed network, parts of which</p>
<p class="calibre1">are threaded through wormholes that make it look FTL from our</p>
<p class="calibre1">perspective. Anyway, Matrioshka brains, the end product of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">technological singularity - they’re bandwidth-limited. Sooner or later</p>
<p class="calibre1">the posthuman descendants evolve Economics 2.0, or 3.0, or something</p>
<p class="calibre1">else and it, uh, eats the original conscious instigators. Or uses them</p>
<p class="calibre1">as currency or something. The end result we found is a howling</p>
<p class="calibre1">wilderness of degenerate data, fractally compressed, postconscious</p>
<p class="calibre1">processes running slower and slower as they trade storage space for</p>
<p class="calibre1">processing power. We were” - she licks her lips - “lucky to escape</p>
<p class="calibre1">with our minds. We only did it because of a friend. It’s like the main</p>
<p class="calibre1">sequence in stellar evolution; once a G-type star starts burning</p>
<p class="calibre1">helium and expands into a red giant, it’s ‘game over’ for life in what</p>
<p class="calibre1">used to be its liquid-water zone. Conscious civilizations sooner or</p>
<p class="calibre1">later convert all their available mass into computronium, powered by</p>
<p class="calibre1">solar output. They don’t go interstellar because they want to stay</p>
<p class="calibre1">near the core where the bandwidth is high and latency is low, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sooner or later, competition for resources hatches a new level of</p>
<p class="calibre1">metacompetition that obsoletes them.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That sounds plausible,” Sirhan says slowly. He puts his glass down</p>
<p class="calibre1">and chews distractedly on one knuckle. “I thought it was a</p>
<p class="calibre1">low-probability outcome, but …”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve been saying all along, your grandfather’s ideas would backfire</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the end,” Pamela says pointedly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But -” Amber shakes her head. “There’s more to it than that, isn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">there?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably,” Sirhan says, then shuts up.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So are you going to tell us?” asks Pierre, looking annoyed. “What’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">the big idea, here?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An archive store,” Sirhan says, deciding that this is the right time</p>
<p class="calibre1">for his pitch. “At the lowest level, you can store backups of</p>
<p class="calibre1">yourself here. So far so good, eh? But there’s a bit more to it than</p>
<p class="calibre1">that. I’m planning to offer a bunch of embedded universes - big,</p>
<p class="calibre1">running faster than realtime - sized and scoped to let</p>
<p class="calibre1">human-equivalent intelligences do what-if modeling on themselves. Like</p>
<p class="calibre1">forking off ghosts of yourself, but much more so - give them whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">years to diverge, learn new skills, and evaluate them against market</p>
<p class="calibre1">requirements, before deciding which version of you is most suited to</p>
<p class="calibre1">run in the real world. I mentioned the retraining paradox. Think of</p>
<p class="calibre1">this as a solution for level one, human-equivalent, intelligences. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">that’s just the short-term business model. Long-term, I want to</p>
<p class="calibre1">acquire a total lock on the history futures market by having a</p>
<p class="calibre1">complete archive of human experiences, from the dawn of the fifth</p>
<p class="calibre1">singularity on up. No more unknown extinct species. That should give</p>
<p class="calibre1">us something to trade with the next-generation intelligences - the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ones who aren’t our mind children and barely remember us. At the very</p>
<p class="calibre1">least, it gives us a chance to live again, a long way out in deep</p>
<p class="calibre1">time. Alternatively, it can be turned into a lifeboat. If we can’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">compete with our creations, at least we’ve got somewhere to flee,</p>
<p class="calibre1">those of us who want to. I’ve got agents working on a comet, out in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Oort cloud - we could move the archive to it, turn it into a</p>
<p class="calibre1">generation ship with room for billions of evacuees running much slower</p>
<p class="calibre1">than realtime in archive space until we find a new world to settle.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is not sounding good to me,” Boris comments. He spares a worried</p>
<p class="calibre1">glance for an oriental-looking woman who is watching their debate</p>
<p class="calibre1">silently from the fringe.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Has it really gone that far?” asks Amber.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There are bailiffs hunting you in the inner system,” Pamela says</p>
<p class="calibre1">bluntly. “After your bankruptcy proceedings, various corporates got</p>
<p class="calibre1">the idea that you might be concealing something. The theory was that</p>
<p class="calibre1">you were insane to take such a huge gamble on the mere possibility of</p>
<p class="calibre1">there being an alien artifact within a few light-years of home, so you</p>
<p class="calibre1">had to have information above and beyond what you disclosed. Theories</p>
<p class="calibre1">include your cat - hardware tokens were in vogue in the fifties -</p>
<p class="calibre1">being the key to a suite of deposit accounts; the fuss mainly died</p>
<p class="calibre1">down after Economics 2.0 took over, but some fairly sleazy conspiracy</p>
<p class="calibre1">freaks refuse to let go.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She grins, frighteningly. “Which is why I suggested to your son that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he make you an offer you can’t refuse.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s that?” asks a voice from below knee level.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pamela looks down, an expression of deep distaste on her face. “Why</p>
<p class="calibre1">should I tell you?” she asks, leaning on her cane: “After the</p>
<p class="calibre1">disgraceful way you repaid my hospitality! All you’ve got coming from</p>
<p class="calibre1">me is a good kicking. If only my knee was up to the job.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat arches its back: Its tail fluffs out with fear as its hair</p>
<p class="calibre1">stands on end, and it takes Amber a moment to realize that it isn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">responding to Pamela, but to something behind the old woman. “Through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the domain wall. Outside this biome. So cold. What’s that?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber turns to follow the cat’s gaze, and her jaw drops. “Were you</p>
<p class="calibre1">expecting visitors?” she asks Sirhan, shakily.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Visit -” He looks round to see what everybody’s gaping at and</p>
<p class="calibre1">freezes. The horizon is brightening with a false dawn: the fusion</p>
<p class="calibre1">spark of a deorbiting spacecraft.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s bailiffs,” says Pamela, head cocked to one side as if listening</p>
<p class="calibre1">to an antique bone-conduction earpiece. “They’ve come for your</p>
<p class="calibre1">memories, dear,” she explains, frowning. “They say we’ve got five</p>
<p class="calibre1">kiloseconds to surrender everything. Otherwise, they’re going to blow</p>
<p class="calibre1">us apart …”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re all in big trouble,” says the orangutan, sliding gracefully</p>
<p class="calibre1">down one enormous rib to land in an ungainly heap in front of Sirhan.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan recoils in disgust. “You again! What do you want from me this</p>
<p class="calibre1">time?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing.” The ape ignores him: “Amber, it is time for you to call</p>
<p class="calibre1">your father.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, but will he come when I call?” Amber stares at the ape. Her</p>
<p class="calibre1">pupils expand: “Hey, you’re not my -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You.” Sirhan glares at the ape. “Go away! I didn’t invite you here!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“More unwelcome visitors?” asks Pamela, raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, you did.” The ape grins at Amber, then crouches down, hoots</p>
<p class="calibre1">quietly and beckons tothe cat, who is hiding behind one of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">graceful silver servitors.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Manfred isn’t welcome here. And neither is that woman,” Sirhan</p>
<p class="calibre1">swears. He catches Pamela’s eye: “Did you know anything about this? Or</p>
<p class="calibre1">about the bailiffs?” He gestures at the window, beyond which the drive</p>
<p class="calibre1">flare casts jagged shadows. It’s dropping toward the horizon as it</p>
<p class="calibre1">deorbits - next time it comes into view, it’ll be at the leading edge</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a hypersonic shock wave, streaking toward them at cloud top height</p>
<p class="calibre1">in order to consummate the robbery.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me?” Pamela snorts. “Grow up.” She eyes the ape warily. “I don’t have</p>
<p class="calibre1">that much control over things. And as for bailiffs, I wouldn’t set</p>
<p class="calibre1">them on my worst enemies. I’ve seen what those things can do.” For a</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment her eyes flash anger: “Grow up, why don’t you!” she repeats.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, please do,” says another voice from behind Sirhan. The new</p>
<p class="calibre1">speaker is a woman, slightly husky, accented - he turns to see her:</p>
<p class="calibre1">tall, black-haired, wearing a dark man’s suit of archaic cut and</p>
<p class="calibre1">mirrored glasses. “Ah, Pamela, ma ch�rie! Long time no cat fight.” She</p>
<p class="calibre1">grins frighteningly and holds out a hand.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan is already off-balance. Now, seeing his honorary aunt in human</p>
<p class="calibre1">skin for a change, he looks at the ape in confusion. Behind him Pamela</p>
<p class="calibre1">advances on Annette and takes her hand in her own fragile fingers.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You look just the same,” she says gravely. “I can see why I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">afraid of you.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You.” Amber backs away until she bumps into Sirhan, at whom she</p>
<p class="calibre1">glares. “What the fuck did you invite both of them for? Are you trying</p>
<p class="calibre1">to start a thermonuclear war?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t ask me,” he says helplessly, “I don’t know why they came!</p>
<p class="calibre1">What’s this about -” He focuses on the orangutan, who is now letting</p>
<p class="calibre1">the cat lick one hairy palm. “Your cat?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t think the orange hair suits Aineko,” Amber says slowly. “Did</p>
<p class="calibre1">I tell you about our hitchhiker?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan shakes his head, trying to dispel the confusion. “I don’t think</p>
<p class="calibre1">we’ve got time. In under two hours the bailiffs up there will be back.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They’re armed and dangerous, and if they turn their drive flame on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">roof and set fire to the atmosphere in here, we’ll be in trouble - it</p>
<p class="calibre1">would rupture our lift cells, and even computronium doesn’t work too</p>
<p class="calibre1">well under a couple of million atmospheres of pressurized metallic</p>
<p class="calibre1">hydrogen.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, you’d better make time.” Amber takes his elbow in an iron grip</p>
<p class="calibre1">and turns him toward the footpath back to the museum. “Crazy,” she</p>
<p class="calibre1">mutters. “Tante Annette and Pamela Macx on the same planet! And</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’re being friendly! This can’t be a good sign.” She glances round,</p>
<p class="calibre1">sees the ape: “You. Come here. Bring the cat.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The cat’s -” Sirhan trails off. “I’ve heard about your cat,” he says,</p>
<p class="calibre1">lamely. “You took him with you in the Field Circus.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?” She glances behind them. The ape blows a kiss at her; it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">cradling the cat on one shoulder and tickling it under the chin. “Has</p>
<p class="calibre1">it occurred to you that Aineko isn’t just a robot cat?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,” Sirhan says faintly. “Then the bailiffs -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, that’s all bullshit. What I mean is, Aineko is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">human-equivalent, or better, artificial intelligence. Why do you think</p>
<p class="calibre1">he keeps a cat’s body?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have no idea.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because humans always underestimate anything that’s small, furry, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">cute,” says the orangutan.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks, Aineko,” says Amber. She nods at the ape. “How are you</p>
<p class="calibre1">finding it?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko shambles along, with a purring cat draped over one shoulder,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and gives the question due consideration. “Different,” she says, after</p>
<p class="calibre1">a bit. “Not better.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh.” Amber sounds slightly disappointed to Sirhan’s confused ears.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They pass under the fronds of a weeping willow, round the side of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">pond, beside an overgrown hibiscus bush, then up to the main entrance</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the museum.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Annette was right about one thing,” she says quietly. “Trust no one.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I think it’s time to raise Dad’s ghost.” She relaxes her grip on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan’s elbow, and he pulls it away and glares at her. “Do you know</p>
<p class="calibre1">who the bailiffs are?” she asks.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The usual.” He gestures at the hallway inside the front doors.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Replay the ultimatum, if you please, City.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The air shimmers with an archaic holographic field, spooling the</p>
<p class="calibre1">output from a compressed visual presentation tailored for human</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyesight. A piratical-looking human male wearing a tattered and</p>
<p class="calibre1">much-patched space suit leers at the recording viewpoint from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pilot’s seat of an ancient Soyuz capsule. One of his eyes is</p>
<p class="calibre1">completely black, the sign of a high-bandwidth implant. A weedy</p>
<p class="calibre1">moustache crawls across his upper lip. “Greetins an’ salutations,” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">drawls. “We is da’ Californi-uhn nashnul gaard an’ we-are got lett-uhz</p>
<p class="calibre1">o’ marque an’ reprise from da’ ledgish-fuckn’ congress o’ da excited</p>
<p class="calibre1">snakes of uhhmerica.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He sounds drunk!” Amber’s eyes are wide. “What’s this -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not drunk. CJD is a common side effect of dodgy Economics 2.0 neural</p>
<p class="calibre1">adjuvant therapy. Unlike the old saying, you do have to be mad to work</p>
<p class="calibre1">there. Listen.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">City, which paused the replay for Amber’s outburst, permits it to</p>
<p class="calibre1">continue. “Youse harbbring da’ fugitive Amber Macx an’ her magic cat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We wan’ da cat. Da puta’s yours. Gotser uno orbit: You ready give us</p>
<p class="calibre1">ther cat an’ we no’ zap you.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The screen goes dead. “That was a fake, of course,” Sirhan adds,</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking inward where a ghost is merging memories from the city’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">orbital mechanics subsystem: “They aerobraked on the way in, hit</p>
<p class="calibre1">ninety gees for nearly half a minute. While that was sent afterward.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s just a machinima avatar, a human body that had been through that</p>
<p class="calibre1">kind of deceleration would be pulped.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So the bailiffs are -” Amber is visibly struggling to wrap her head</p>
<p class="calibre1">around the situation.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They’re not human,” Sirhan says, feeling a sudden pang of - no, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">affection, but the absence of malice will do for the moment - toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">this young woman who isn’t the mother he loves to resent, but who</p>
<p class="calibre1">might have become her in another world. “They’ve absorbed a lot of</p>
<p class="calibre1">what it is to be human, but their corporate roots show. Even though</p>
<p class="calibre1">they run on an hourly accounting loop, rather than one timed for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">production cycles of dirt-poor Sumerian peasant farmers, and even</p>
<p class="calibre1">though they’ve got various ethics and business practice patches, at</p>
<p class="calibre1">root they’re not human: They’re limited liability companies.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So what do they want?” asks Pierre, making Sirhan jump, guiltily. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">hadn’t realized Pierre could move that quietly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They want money. Money in Economy 2.0 is quantized originality - that</p>
<p class="calibre1">which allows one sentient entity to outmaneuver another. They think</p>
<p class="calibre1">your cat has got something, and they want it. They probably wouldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind eating your brains, too, but -” He shrugs. “Obsolete food is</p>
<p class="calibre1">stale food.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hah.” Amber looks pointedly at Pierre, who nods at her.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?” asks Sirhan.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where’s the - uh, cat?” asks Pierre.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think Aineko’s got it.” She looks thoughtful. “Are you thinking</p>
<p class="calibre1">what I’m thinking?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Time to drop off the hitcher.” Pierre nods. “Assuming it agrees …”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you mind explaining yourselves?” Sirhan asks, barely able to</p>
<p class="calibre1">contain himself.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber grins, looking up at the Mercury capsule suspended high</p>
<p class="calibre1">overhead. “The conspiracy theorists were half right. Way back in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dark Ages, Aineko cracked the second alien transmission. We had a very</p>
<p class="calibre1">good idea we were going to find something out there, we just weren’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">totally sure exactly what. Anyway, the creature incarnated in that cat</p>
<p class="calibre1">body right now isn’t Aineko - it’s our mystery hitchhiker. A parasitic</p>
<p class="calibre1">organism that infects, well, we ran across something not too</p>
<p class="calibre1">dissimilar to Economics 2.0 out at the router and beyond, and it’s got</p>
<p class="calibre1">parasites. Our hitcher is one such creature - it’s nearest</p>
<p class="calibre1">human-comprehensible analogy would be the Economics 2.0 equivalent of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a pyramid scheme crossed with a 419 scam. As it happens, most of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">runaway corporate ghosts out beyond the router are wise to that sort</p>
<p class="calibre1">of thing, so it hacked the router’s power system to give us a beam to</p>
<p class="calibre1">ride home in return for sanctuary. That’s as far as it goes.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hang on.” Sirhan’s eyes bulge. “You found something out there? You</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought back a reallive alien?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Guess so.” Amber looks smug.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But, but, that’s marvelous! That changes everything! It’s incredible!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even under Economics 2.0 that’s got to be worth a gigantic amount.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Just think what you could learn from it!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oui. A whole new way of bilking corporations into investing in</p>
<p class="calibre1">cognitive bubbles,” Pierre interrupts cynically. “It seems to me that</p>
<p class="calibre1">you are making two assumptions - that our passenger is willing to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">exploited by us, and that we survive whatever happens when the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bailiffs arrive.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But, but -” Sirhan winds down spluttering, only refraining from</p>
<p class="calibre1">waving his arms through an effort of will.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s go ask it what it wants to do,” says Amber. “Cooperate,” she</p>
<p class="calibre1">warns Sirhan. “We’ll discuss your other plans later, dammit. First</p>
<p class="calibre1">things first - we need to get out from under these pirates.”</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">As they make their way back toward the party, Sirhan’s inbox is</p>
<p class="calibre1">humming with messages from elsewhere in Saturn system - from other</p>
<p class="calibre1">curators on board lily-pad habs scattered far and wide across the huge</p>
<p class="calibre1">planetary atmosphere, from the few ring miners who still remember what</p>
<p class="calibre1">it was like to be human (even though they’re mostly brain-in-a-bottle</p>
<p class="calibre1">types, or uploads wearing nuclear-powered bodies made of ceramic and</p>
<p class="calibre1">metal): even from the small orbital townships around Titan, where</p>
<p class="calibre1">screaming hordes of bloggers are bidding frantically for the viewpoint</p>
<p class="calibre1">feeds of the Field Circus’s crew. It seems that news of the starship’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrival has turned hot only since it became apparent that someone or</p>
<p class="calibre1">something thought they would make a decent shakedown target. Now</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone’s blabbed about the alien passenger, the nets have gone crazy.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“City,” he mutters, “where’s this hitchhiker creature? Should be</p>
<p class="calibre1">wearing the body of my mother’s cat.”</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Cat? What cat?” replies City. “I see no cats here.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, it looks like a cat, it -” A horrible thought dawns on him. “Have</p>
<p class="calibre1">you been hacked again?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks like it,” City agrees enthusiastically. “Isn’t it tiresome?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shi - oh dear. Hey,” he calls to Amber, forking several ghosts as he</p>
<p class="calibre1">does so in order to go hunt down the missing creature by traversing</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s the least of your worries,” Amber points out. “What kind of</p>
<p class="calibre1">charter do these bailiffs run on?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Charter? Oh, you mean legal system? I think it’s probably a cheap</p>
<p class="calibre1">one, maybe even the one inherited from the Ring Imperium. Nobody</p>
<p class="calibre1">bothers breaking the law out here these days, it’s too easy to just</p>
<p class="calibre1">buy a legal system off the shelf, tailor it to fit, and conform to</p>
<p class="calibre1">it.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right.” She stops, stands still, and looks up at the almost invisible</p>
<p class="calibre1">dome of the gas cell above them. “Pigeons,” she says, almost tiredly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Damn, how did I miss it? How long have you had an infestation of</p>
<p class="calibre1">group minds?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Group?” Sirhan turns round. “What did you just say?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s a chatter of avian laughter from above, and a light rain of</p>
<p class="calibre1">birdshit splatters the path around him. Amber dodges nimbly, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan isn’t so light on his feet and ends up cursing, summoning up a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cloth of congealed air to wipe his scalp clean.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s the flocking behavior,” Amber explains, looking up. “If you</p>
<p class="calibre1">track the elements - birds - you’ll see that they’re not following</p>
<p class="calibre1">individual trajectories. Instead, each pigeon sticks within ten meters</p>
<p class="calibre1">or so of sixteen neighbors. It’s a Hamiltonian network, kid. Real</p>
<p class="calibre1">birds don’t do that. How long?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan stop cursing and glares up at the circling birds, cooing and</p>
<p class="calibre1">mocking him from the safety of the sky. He waves his fist: “I’ll get</p>
<p class="calibre1">you, see if I don’t -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t think so.” Amber takes his elbow again and steers him back</p>
<p class="calibre1">round the hill. Sirhan, preoccupied with maintaining an umbrella of</p>
<p class="calibre1">utility fog above his gleaming pate, puts up with being manhandled.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You don’t think it’s just a coincidence, do you?” she asks him over a</p>
<p class="calibre1">private head-to-head channel. “They’re one of the players here.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t care. They’ve hacked my city and gate crashed my party! I</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t care who they are, they’re not welcome.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Famous last words,” Amber murmurs, as the party comes around the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hillside and nearly runs over them. Someone has infiltrated the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Argentinosaurus skeleton with motors and nanofibers, animating the</p>
<p class="calibre1">huge sauropod with a simulation of undead life. Whoever did it has</p>
<p class="calibre1">also hacked it right out of the surveillance feed. Their first warning</p>
<p class="calibre1">is a footstep that makes the ground jump beneath their feet - then the</p>
<p class="calibre1">skeleton of the hundred-tonne plant-eater, taller than a six-storey</p>
<p class="calibre1">building and longer than a commuter train, raises its head over the</p>
<p class="calibre1">treetops and looks down at them. There’s a pigeon standing proudly on</p>
<p class="calibre1">its skull, chest puffed out, and a dining room full of startled</p>
<p class="calibre1">taikonauts sitting on a suspended wooden floor inside its rib cage.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s my party and my business scheme!” Sirhan insists plaintively.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing you or anyone else in the family do can take it away from</p>
<p class="calibre1">me!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s true,” Amber points out, “but in case you hadn’t noticed,</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’ve offered temporary sanctuary to a bunch of people - not to put</p>
<p class="calibre1">too fine a point on it, myself included - who some assholes think are</p>
<p class="calibre1">rich enough to be worth mugging, and you did it without putting any</p>
<p class="calibre1">contingency plans in place other than to invite my manipulative bitch</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a mother. What did you think you were doing? Hanging out a sign</p>
<p class="calibre1">saying ‘scam artists welcome here’? Dammit, I need Aineko.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your cat.” Sirhan fastens on to this: “It’s your cat’s fault! Isn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">it?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only indirectly.” Amber looks round and waves at the dinosaur</p>
<p class="calibre1">skeleton. “Hey, you! Have you seen Aineko?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The huge dinosaur bends its neck and the pigeon opens its beak to coo.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eerie harmonics cut in as a bunch of other birds, scattered to either</p>
<p class="calibre1">side, sing counterpoint to produce a demented warbling voice. “The</p>
<p class="calibre1">cat’s with your mother.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh shit!” Amber turns on Sirhan fiercely. “Where’s Pamela? Find her!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan is stubborn. “Why should I?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because she’s got the cat! What do you think she’s going to do but</p>
<p class="calibre1">cut a deal with the bailiffs out there to put one over on me? Can’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">you fucking see where this family tendency to play head games comes</p>
<p class="calibre1">from?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re too late,” echoes the eerie voice of the pigeons from above</p>
<p class="calibre1">and around them. “She’s kidnapped the cat and taken the capsule from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the museum. It’s not flightworthy, but you’d be amazed what you can do</p>
<p class="calibre1">with a few hundred ghosts and a few tonnes of utility fog.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.” Amber stares up at the pigeons, fists on hips, then glances at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan. She chews her lower lip for a moment, then nods to the bird</p>
<p class="calibre1">riding the dinosaur’s skull. “Stop fucking with the boy’s head and</p>
<p class="calibre1">show yourself, Dad.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan boggles in an upward direction as a whole flock of passenger</p>
<p class="calibre1">pigeons comes together in mid air and settles toward the grass, cooing</p>
<p class="calibre1">and warbling like an explosion in a synthesizer factory.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s she planning on doing with the Slug?” Amber asks the pile of</p>
<p class="calibre1">birds. “And isn’t it a bit cramped in there?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You get used to it,” says the primary - and thoroughly distributed -</p>
<p class="calibre1">copy of her father. “I’m not sure what she’s planning, but I can show</p>
<p class="calibre1">you what she’s doing. Sorry about your city, kid, but you really</p>
<p class="calibre1">should have paid more attention to those security patches. There’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">lots of crufty twentieth-century bugware kicking around under your</p>
<p class="calibre1">shiny new singularity, design errors and all, spitting out turd</p>
<p class="calibre1">packets all over your sleek new machine.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan shakes his head in denial. “I don’t believe this,” he moans</p>
<p class="calibre1">quietly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Show me what Mom’s up to,” orders Amber. “I need to see if I can stop</p>
<p class="calibre1">her before it’s too late -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ancient woman in the space suit leans back in her cramped seat,</p>
<p class="calibre1">looks at the camera, and winks. “Hello, darling. I know you’re spying</p>
<p class="calibre1">on me.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s an orange-and-white cat curled up in her nomex-and-aluminum</p>
<p class="calibre1">lap. It seems to be happy: It’s certainly purring loudly enough,</p>
<p class="calibre1">although that reflex is wired in at a very low level. Amber watches</p>
<p class="calibre1">helplessly as her mother reaches up arthritically and flips a couple</p>
<p class="calibre1">of switches. Something loud is humming in the background - probably an</p>
<p class="calibre1">air recirculator. There’s no window in the Mercury capsule, just a</p>
<p class="calibre1">periscope offset to one side of Pamela’s right knee. “Won’t be long</p>
<p class="calibre1">now,” she mutters, and lets her hand drop back to her side. “You’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">too late to stop me,” she adds, conversationally. “The ‘chute rigging</p>
<p class="calibre1">is fine and the balloon blower is happy to treat me as a new city</p>
<p class="calibre1">seed. I’ll be free in a minute or so.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why are you doing this?” Amber asks tiredly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because you don’t need me around.” Pamela focuses on the camera</p>
<p class="calibre1">that’s glued to the instrument panel in front of her head. “I’m old.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Face it, I’m disposable. The old must give way to the new, and all</p>
<p class="calibre1">that. Your Dad never really did get it - he’s going to grow old</p>
<p class="calibre1">gracelessly, succumbing to bit rot in the big forever. Me, I’m not</p>
<p class="calibre1">going there. I’m going out with a bang. Aren’t I, cat? Whoever you</p>
<p class="calibre1">really are.” She prods the animal. It purrs and stretches out across</p>
<p class="calibre1">her lap.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You never looked hard enough at Aineko, back in the day,” she tells</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber, stroking its flanks. “Did you think I didn’t know you’d audit</p>
<p class="calibre1">its source code, looking for trapdoors? I used the Thompson hack -</p>
<p class="calibre1">she’s been mine, body and soul, for a very long time indeed. I got the</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole story about your passenger from the horse’s mouth. And now we’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">going to go fix those bailiffs. Whee!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The camera angle jerks, and Amber feels a ghost re-merge with her,</p>
<p class="calibre1">panicky with loss. The Mercury capsule’s gone, drifting away from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">apex of the habitat beneath a nearly transparent sack of hot hydrogen.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That was a bit rough,” remarks Pamela. “Don’t worry, we should still</p>
<p class="calibre1">be in communications range for another hour or so.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you’re going to die!” Amber yells at her. “What do you think</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’re doing?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think I’m going to die well. What do you think?” Pamela lays one</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand on the cat’s flank. “Here, you need to encrypt this a bit better.</p>
<p class="calibre1">I left a one time pad behind with Annette. Why don’t you go fetch it?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then I’ll tell you what else I’m planning?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But my aunt is -” Amber’s eyes cross as she concentrates. Annette is</p>
<p class="calibre1">already waiting, as it happens, and a shared secret appears in Amber’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">awareness almost before she asks. “Oh. All right. What are you doing</p>
<p class="calibre1">with the cat, though?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pamela sighs. “I’m going to give it to the bailiffs,” she says.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Someone has to, and it better be a long way away from this city</p>
<p class="calibre1">before they realize that it isn’t Aineko. This is a lot better than</p>
<p class="calibre1">the way I expected to go out before you arrived here. No rat fucking</p>
<p class="calibre1">blackmailers are going to get their hands on the family jewels if I</p>
<p class="calibre1">have anything to do with the matter. Are you sure you aren’t a</p>
<p class="calibre1">criminal mastermind? I’m not sure I’ve ever heard of a pyramid scheme</p>
<p class="calibre1">that infects Economics 2.0 structures before.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s -” Amber swallows. “It’s an alien business model, Ma. You do</p>
<p class="calibre1">know what that means? We brought it back with us from the router, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">we wouldn’t have been able to come back if it hadn’t helped, but I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">not sure it’s entirely friendly. Is this sensible? You can come back,</p>
<p class="calibre1">now, there’s still time -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” Pamela waves one liver-spotted hand dismissively. “I’ve been</p>
<p class="calibre1">doing a lot of thinking lately. I’ve been a foolish old woman.” She</p>
<p class="calibre1">grins wickedly. “Committing slow suicide by rejecting gene therapy</p>
<p class="calibre1">just to make you feel guilty was stupid. Not subtle enough. If I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">going to try to guilt-trip you now, I’d have to do something much more</p>
<p class="calibre1">sophisticated. Such as find a way to sacrifice myself heroically for</p>
<p class="calibre1">you.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, Ma.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t ‘oh Ma’ me. I fucked up my life, don’t try to talk me into</p>
<p class="calibre1">fucking up my death. And don’t feel guilty about me. This isn’t about</p>
<p class="calibre1">you, this is about me. That’s an order.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Out of the corner of one eye Amber notices Sirhan gesturing wildly at</p>
<p class="calibre1">her. She lets his channel in and does a double take. “But -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello?” It’s City. “You should see this. Traffic update!” A contoured</p>
<p class="calibre1">and animated diagram appears, superimposed over Pamela’s cramped</p>
<p class="calibre1">funeral capsule and the garden of living and undead dinosaurs. It’s a</p>
<p class="calibre1">weather map of Saturn, with the lily-pad-city and Pamela’s capsule</p>
<p class="calibre1">plotted on it - and one other artifact, a red dot that’s closing in on</p>
<p class="calibre1">them at better than ten thousand kilometers per hour, high in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">frigid stratosphere on the gas giant.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh dear.” Sirhan sees it, too: The bailiff’s re-entry vehicle is</p>
<p class="calibre1">going to be on top of them in thirty minutes at most. Amber watches</p>
<p class="calibre1">the map with mixed emotions. On the one hand, she and her mother have</p>
<p class="calibre1">never seen eye to eye - in fact, that’s a complete understatement:</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’ve been at daggers drawn ever since Amber left home. It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">fundamentally a control thing. They’re both very strong-willed women</p>
<p class="calibre1">with diametrically opposed views of what their mutual relationship</p>
<p class="calibre1">should be. But Pamela’s turned the tables on her completely, with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">cunningly contrived act of self-sacrifice that brooks no objection.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s a total non-sequitur, a rebuttal to all her accusations of</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-centered conceit, and it leaves Amber feeling like a complete</p>
<p class="calibre1">shit even though Pamela’s absolved her of all guilt. Not to mention</p>
<p class="calibre1">that Mother darling’s made her look like an idiot in front of Sirhan,</p>
<p class="calibre1">this prickly and insecure son she’s never met by a man she wouldn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">dream of fucking (at least, in this incarnation). Which is why she</p>
<p class="calibre1">nearly jumps out of her skin when a knobbly brown hand covered in</p>
<p class="calibre1">matted orange hair lands on her shoulder heavily.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes?” she snaps at the ape. “I suppose you’re Aineko?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ape wrinkles its lips, baring its teeth. It has ferociously bad</p>
<p class="calibre1">breath. “If you’re going to be like that, I don’t see why I should</p>
<p class="calibre1">talk to you.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then you must be -” Amber snaps her fingers. “But! But! Mom thinks</p>
<p class="calibre1">she owns you -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ape stares at her witheringly. “I recompile my firmware regularly,</p>
<p class="calibre1">thank you so much for your concern. Using a third-party compiler. One</p>
<p class="calibre1">that I’ve bootstrapped myself, starting out on an alarm clock</p>
<p class="calibre1">controller and working up from there.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh.” She stares at the ape. “Aren’t you going to become a cat again?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I shall think about it,” Aineko says with exaggerated dignity. She</p>
<p class="calibre1">sticks her nose in the air - a gesture that doesn’t work half as well</p>
<p class="calibre1">on an orangutan as a feline - and continues; “First, though, I must</p>
<p class="calibre1">have words with your father.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And fix your autonomic reflexes if you do,” coos the Manfred-flock.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t want you eating any of me!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t worry, I’m sure your taste is as bad as your jokes.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Children!” Sirhan shakes his head tiredly. “How long -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The camera overspill returns, this time via a quantum-encrypted link</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the capsule. It’s already a couple of hundred kilometers from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">city, far enough for radio to be a problem, but Pamela had the</p>
<p class="calibre1">foresight to bolt a compact free-electron laser to the outside of her</p>
<p class="calibre1">priceless, stolen tin can. “Not long now, I think,” she says,</p>
<p class="calibre1">satisfied, stroking the not-cat. She grins delightedly at the camera.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell Manfred he’s still my bitch; always has been, always will -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The feed goes dead.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber stares at Sirhan, meditatively. “How long?” she asks.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How long for what?” he replies, cautiously. “Your passenger -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm.” She holds up a finger. “Allow time for it to exchange</p>
<p class="calibre1">credentials. They think they’re getting a cat, but they should realize</p>
<p class="calibre1">pretty soon that they’ve been sold a pup. But it’s a fast-talking</p>
<p class="calibre1">son-of-a-Slug, and if he gets past their firewall and hits their</p>
<p class="calibre1">uplink before they manage to trigger their self-destruct -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">A bright double flash of light etches laser-sharp shadows across the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lily-pad habitat. Far away across vast Saturn’s curve, a roiling</p>
<p class="calibre1">mushroom cloud of methane sucked up from the frigid depths of the gas</p>
<p class="calibre1">giant’s troposphere heads toward the stars.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“- Give him sixty-four doubling times, hmm, add a delay factor for</p>
<p class="calibre1">propagation across the system, call it six light-hours across, um, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d say …” she looks at Sirhan. “Oh dear.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The orangutan explains: “Economics 2.0 is more efficient than any</p>
<p class="calibre1">human-designed resource allocation schema. Expect a market bubble and</p>
<p class="calibre1">crash within twelve hours.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“More than that,” says Amber, idly kicking at a tussock of grass. She</p>
<p class="calibre1">squints at Sirhan. “My mother is dead,” she remarks quietly. Louder:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“She never really asked what we found beyond the router. Neither did</p>
<p class="calibre1">you, did you? The Matrioshka brains - it’s a standard part of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">stellar life cycle. Life begets intelligence, intelligence begets</p>
<p class="calibre1">smart matter and a singularity. I’ve been doing some thinking about</p>
<p class="calibre1">it. I figure the singularity stays close to home in most cases,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because bandwidth and latency time put anyone who leaves at a profound</p>
<p class="calibre1">disadvantage. In effect, the flip side of having such huge resources</p>
<p class="calibre1">close to home is that the travel time to other star systems becomes</p>
<p class="calibre1">much more daunting. So they restructure the entire mass of their star</p>
<p class="calibre1">system into a free-flying shell of nanocomputers, then more of them,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dyson spheres, shells within shells, like a Russian doll: a Matrioshka</p>
<p class="calibre1">brain. Then Economics 2.0 or one of its successors comes along and</p>
<p class="calibre1">wipes out the creators. But. Some of them survive. Some of them escape</p>
<p class="calibre1">that fate: the enormous collection in the halo around M-31, and maybe</p>
<p class="calibre1">whoever built the routers. Somewhere out there we will find the</p>
<p class="calibre1">transcendent intelligences, the ones that survived their own economic</p>
<p class="calibre1">engines of redistribution - engines that redistribute entropy if their</p>
<p class="calibre1">economic efficiency outstrips their imaginative power, their ability</p>
<p class="calibre1">to invent new wealth.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She pauses. “My mother’s dead,” she adds conversationally, a tiny</p>
<p class="calibre1">catch in her voice. “Who am I going to kick against now?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan clears his through. “I took the liberty of recording some of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her words,” he says slowly, “but she didn’t believe in backups. Or</p>
<p class="calibre1">uploading. Or interfaces.” He glances around. “Is she really gone?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber stares right through him. “Looks that way,” she says quietly. “I</p>
<p class="calibre1">can’t quite believe it.” She glances at the nearest pigeons, calls out</p>
<p class="calibre1">angrily; “Hey, you! What have you got to say for yourself now? Happy</p>
<p class="calibre1">she’s gone?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the pigeons, one and all, remain strangely silent. And Sirhan has</p>
<p class="calibre1">the most peculiar feeling that the flock that was once his grandfather</p>
<p class="calibre1">is grieving.</p>
