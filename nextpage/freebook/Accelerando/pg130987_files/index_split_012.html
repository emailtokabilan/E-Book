<h2 id="calibre_toc_8" class="calibre3">Chapter 3: Tourist</h2><p class="calibre1">Spring-Heeled Jack runs blind, blue fumes crackling from his heels.</p>
<p class="calibre1">His right hand, outstretched for balance, clutches a mark’s stolen</p>
<p class="calibre1">memories. The victim is sitting on the hard stones of the pavement</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind him. Maybe he’s wondering what’s happened; maybe he looks after</p>
<p class="calibre1">the fleeing youth. But the tourist crowds block the view effectively,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and in any case, he has no hope of catching the mugger. Hit-and-run</p>
<p class="calibre1">amnesia is what the polis call it, but to Spring-Heeled Jack it’s just</p>
<p class="calibre1">more loot to buy fuel for his Russian army-surplus motorized combat</p>
<p class="calibre1">boots.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The victim sits on the cobblestones clutching his aching temples. What</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened? he wonders. The universe is a brightly colored blur of</p>
<p class="calibre1">fast-moving shapes augmented by deafening noises. His ear-mounted</p>
<p class="calibre1">cameras are rebooting repeatedly: They panic every eight hundred</p>
<p class="calibre1">milliseconds, whenever they realize that they’re alone on his personal</p>
<p class="calibre1">area network without the comforting support of a hub to tell them</p>
<p class="calibre1">where to send his incoming sensory feed. Two of his mobile phones are</p>
<p class="calibre1">bickering moronically, disputing ownership of his grid bandwidth, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">his memory … is missing.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">A tall blond clutching an electric chainsaw sheathed in pink bubble</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrap leans over him curiously: “you all right?” she asks.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I -” He shakes his head, which hurts. “Who am I?” His medical monitor</p>
<p class="calibre1">is alarmed because his blood pressure has fallen: His pulse is racing,</p>
<p class="calibre1">his serum cortisol titer is up, and a host of other biometrics suggest</p>
<p class="calibre1">that he’s going into shock.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think you need an ambulance,” the woman announces. She mutters at</p>
<p class="calibre1">her lapel, “Phone, call an ambulance. ” She waves a finger vaguely at</p>
<p class="calibre1">him as if to reify a geolink, then wanders off, chainsaw clutched</p>
<p class="calibre1">under one arm. Typical southern �migr� behavior in the Athens of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">North, too embarrassed to get involved. The man shakes his head again,</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes closed, as a flock of girls on powered blades skid around him in</p>
<p class="calibre1">elaborate loops. A siren begins to warble, over the bridge to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">north.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Who am I? he wonders. “I’m Manfred,” he says with a sense of stunned</p>
<p class="calibre1">wonder. He looks up at the bronze statue of a man on a horse that</p>
<p class="calibre1">looms above the crowds on this busy street corner. Someone has</p>
<p class="calibre1">plastered a Hello Cthulhu! holo on the plaque that names its rider:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Languid fluffy pink tentacles wave at him in an attack of kawaii. “I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred - Manfred. My memory. What’s happened to my memory?” Elderly</p>
<p class="calibre1">Malaysian tourists point at him from the open top deck of a passing</p>
<p class="calibre1">bus. He burns with a sense of horrified urgency. I was going</p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhere, he recalls. What was I doing? It was amazingly important,</p>
<p class="calibre1">he thinks, but he can’t remember what exactly it was. He was going to</p>
<p class="calibre1">see someone about - it’s on the tip of his tongue -</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Welcome to the eve of the third decade: a time of chaos</p>
<p class="calibre1">characterized by an all-out depression in the space industries.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of the thinking power on the planet is now manufactured rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">than born; there are ten microprocessors for every human being, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the number is doubling every fourteen months. Population growth in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the developing world has stalled, the birth rate dropping below</p>
<p class="calibre1">replacement level. In the wired nations, more forward-looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">politicians are looking for ways to enfranchise their nascent AI</p>
<p class="calibre1">base.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Space exploration is still stalled on the cusp of the second</p>
<p class="calibre1">recession of the century. The Malaysian government has announced</p>
<p class="calibre1">the goal of placing an imam on Mars within ten years, but nobody</p>
<p class="calibre1">else cares enough to try.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Space Settlers Society is still trying to interest Disney Corp.</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the media rights to their latest L5 colony plan, unaware that</p>
<p class="calibre1">there’s already a colony out there and it isn’t human:</p>
<p class="calibre1">First-generation uploads, Californian spiny lobsters in wobbly</p>
<p class="calibre1">symbiosis with elderly expert systems, thrive aboard an asteroid</p>
<p class="calibre1">mining project established by the Franklin Trust. Meanwhile,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chinese space agency cutbacks are threatening the continued</p>
<p class="calibre1">existence of Moonbase Mao. Nobody, it seems, has figured out how to</p>
<p class="calibre1">turn a profit out beyond geosynchronous orbit.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two years ago, JPL, the ESA, and the uploaded lobster colony on</p>
<p class="calibre1">comet Khrunichev-7 picked up an apparently artificial signal from</p>
<p class="calibre1">outside the solar system; most people don’t know, and of those who</p>
<p class="calibre1">do, even fewer care. After all, if humans can’t even make it to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mars, who cares what’s going on a hundred trillion kilometers</p>
<p class="calibre1">farther out?</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Portrait of a wasted youth:</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jack is seventeen years and eleven months old. He has never met his</p>
<p class="calibre1">father; he was unplanned, and Dad managed to kill himself in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">building-site accident before the Child Support could garnish his</p>
<p class="calibre1">income for the upbringing. His mother raised him in a two-bedroom</p>
<p class="calibre1">housing association flat in Hawick. She worked in a call center when</p>
<p class="calibre1">he was young, but business dried up: Humans aren’t needed on the end</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a phone anymore. Now she works in a drop-in business shop, stacking</p>
<p class="calibre1">shelves for virtual fly-by-nights that come and go like tourists in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Festival season - but humans aren’t in demand for shelf stacking</p>
<p class="calibre1">either, these days.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">His mother sent Jack to a local religious school, where he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">regularly excluded and effectively ran wild from the age of twelve. By</p>
<p class="calibre1">thirteen, he was wearing a parole cuff for shoplifting; by fourteen,</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’d broken his collarbone in a car crash while joyriding and the dour</p>
<p class="calibre1">Presbyterian sheriff sent him to the Wee Frees, who completed the</p>
<p class="calibre1">destruction of his educational prospects with high principles and an</p>
<p class="calibre1">illicit tawse.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today, he’s a graduate of the hard school of avoiding public</p>
<p class="calibre1">surveillance cameras, with distinctions in steganographic alibi</p>
<p class="calibre1">construction. Mostly this entails high-density crime - if you’re going</p>
<p class="calibre1">to mug someone, do so where there are so many bystanders that they</p>
<p class="calibre1">can’t pin the blame on you. But the polis expert systems are on his</p>
<p class="calibre1">tail. If he keeps it up at this rate, in another four months they’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">have a positive statistical correlation that will convince even a jury</p>
<p class="calibre1">of his peers that he’s guilty as fuck - and then he’ll go down to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Saughton for four years.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Jack doesn’t understand the meaning of a Gaussian distribution or</p>
<p class="calibre1">the significance of a chi-square test, and the future still looks</p>
<p class="calibre1">bright to him as he pulls on the chunky spectacles he ripped off the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tourist gawking at the statue on North Bridge. And after a moment,</p>
<p class="calibre1">when they begin whispering into his ears in stereo and showing him</p>
<p class="calibre1">pictures of the tourist’s vision, it looks even brighter.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gotta make a deal, gotta close a deal,” whisper the glasses. “Meet</p>
<p class="calibre1">the borg, strike a chord.” Weird graphs in lurid colors are filling up</p>
<p class="calibre1">his peripheral vision, like the hallucinations of a drugged</p>
<p class="calibre1">marketroid.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who the fuck are ye?” asks Jack, intrigued by the bright lights and</p>
<p class="calibre1">icons.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am your Cartesian theatre and you are our focus,” murmur the</p>
<p class="calibre1">glasses. “Dow Jones down fifteen points, Federated Confidence up</p>
<p class="calibre1">three, incoming briefing on causal decoupling of social control of</p>
<p class="calibre1">skirt hem lengths, shaving pattern of beards, and emergence of</p>
<p class="calibre1">multidrug antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacilli: Accept?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah can take it,” Jack mumbles, as a torrent of images crashes down on</p>
<p class="calibre1">his eyeballs and jackhammers its way in through his ears like the</p>
<p class="calibre1">superego of a disembodied giant. Which is actually what he’s stolen:</p>
<p class="calibre1">The glasses and waist pouch he grabbed from the tourist are stuffed</p>
<p class="calibre1">with enough hardware to run the entire Internet, circa the turn of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">millennium. They’ve got bandwidth coming out the wazoo, distributed</p>
<p class="calibre1">engines running a bazillion inscrutable search tasks, and a whole slew</p>
<p class="calibre1">of high-level agents that collectively form a large chunk of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">society of mind that is their owner’s personality. Their owner is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">posthuman genius loci of the net, an agalmic entrepreneur turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">policy wonk, specializing in the politics of AI emancipation. When he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was in the biz he was the kind of guy who catalysed value wherever he</p>
<p class="calibre1">went, leaving money trees growing in his footprints. Now he’s the kind</p>
<p class="calibre1">of political backroom hitter who builds coalitions where nobody else</p>
<p class="calibre1">could see common ground. And Jack has stolen his memories. There are</p>
<p class="calibre1">microcams built into the frame of the glasses, pickups in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">earpieces; everything is spooled into the holographic cache in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">belt pack, before being distributed for remote storage. At four months</p>
<p class="calibre1">per terabyte, memory storage is cheap. What makes this bunch so</p>
<p class="calibre1">unusual is that their owner - Manfred - has cross-indexed them with</p>
<p class="calibre1">his agents. Mind uploading may not be a practical technology yet, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred has made an end run on it already.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a very real sense, the glasses are Manfred, regardless of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">identity of the soft machine with its eyeballs behind the lenses. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">it is a very puzzled Manfred who picks himself up and, with a curious</p>
<p class="calibre1">vacancy in his head - except for a hesitant request for information</p>
<p class="calibre1">about accessories for Russian army boots - dusts himself off and heads</p>
<p class="calibre1">for his meeting on the other side of town.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, in another meeting, Manfred’s absence is already being</p>
<p class="calibre1">noticed. “Something, something is wrong,” says Annette. She raises her</p>
<p class="calibre1">mirrorshades and rubs her left eye, visibly worried. “Why is he not</p>
<p class="calibre1">answering his chat? He knows we are due to hold this call with him.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Don’t you think it is odd?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gianni nods and leans back, regarding her from behind his desk. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">prods at the highly polished rosewood desktop. The wood grain slips,</p>
<p class="calibre1">sliding into a strangely different conformation, generating random dot</p>
<p class="calibre1">stereoisograms - messages for his eyes only. “He was visiting Scotland</p>
<p class="calibre1">for me,” he says after a moment. “I do not know his exact whereabouts</p>
<p class="calibre1">- the privacy safeguards - but if you, as his designated next of kin,</p>
<p class="calibre1">travel in person, I am sure you will find it easier. He was going to</p>
<p class="calibre1">talk to the Franklin Collective, face-to-face, one to many …”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The office translator is good, but it can’t provide realtime</p>
<p class="calibre1">lip-synch morphing between French and Italian. Annette has to make an</p>
<p class="calibre1">effort to listen to his words because the shape of his mouth is all</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrong, like a badly dubbed video. Her expensive, recent implants</p>
<p class="calibre1">aren’t connected up to her Broca’s area yet, so she can’t simply</p>
<p class="calibre1">sideload a deep grammar module for Italian. Their communications are</p>
<p class="calibre1">the best that money can buy, their VR environment painstakingly</p>
<p class="calibre1">sculpted, but it still doesn’t break down the language barrier</p>
<p class="calibre1">completely. Besides, there are distractions: the way the desk switches</p>
<p class="calibre1">from black ash to rosewood halfway across its expanse, the strange air</p>
<p class="calibre1">currents that are all wrong for a room this size. “Then what could be</p>
<p class="calibre1">up with him? His voicemail is trying to cover for him. It is good, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">it does not lie convincingly.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gianni looks worried. “Manfred is prone to fits of do his own thing</p>
<p class="calibre1">with telling nobody in advance. But I don’t like this. He should have</p>
<p class="calibre1">to told one of us first.” Ever since that first meeting in Rome, when</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gianni offered him a job, Manfred has been a core member of Gianni’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">team, the fixer who goes out and meets people and solves their</p>
<p class="calibre1">problems. Losing him at this point could be more than embarrassing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides, he’s a friend.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I do not like this either.” She stands up. “If he doesn’t call back</p>
<p class="calibre1">soon -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll go and fetch him.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oui.” A smile flashes across her face, rapidly replaced by worry</p>
<p class="calibre1">lines. “What can have happened?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anything. Nothing.” Gianni shrugs. “But we cannot do without him.” He</p>
<p class="calibre1">casts her a warning glance. “Or you. Don’t let the borg get you.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Either of you.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not to worry, I will just bring him back, whatever has happened.” She</p>
<p class="calibre1">stands up, surprising a vacuum cleaner that skulks behind her desk.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Au revoir!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ciao.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">As she vacates her office, the minister flickers off behind her,</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaving the far wall the dull gray of a cold display panel. Gianni is</p>
<p class="calibre1">in Rome, she’s in Paris, Markus is in D�sseldorf, and Eva’s in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Wroclaw. There are others, trapped in digital cells scattered halfway</p>
<p class="calibre1">across an elderly continent, but as long as they don’t try to shake</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands, they’re free to shout across the office at each other. Their</p>
<p class="calibre1">confidences and dirty jokes tunnel through multiple layers of</p>
<p class="calibre1">anonymized communication.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gianni is trying to make his break out of regional politics and into</p>
<p class="calibre1">European national affairs: Their job - his election team - is to get</p>
<p class="calibre1">him a seat on the Confederacy Commission, as Representative for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Intelligence Oversight, and push the boundaries of posthumanistic</p>
<p class="calibre1">action outward, into deep space and deeper time. Which makes the loss</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a key team player, the house futurologist and fixer, profoundly</p>
<p class="calibre1">interesting to certain people: The walls have ears, and not all the</p>
<p class="calibre1">brains they feed into are human.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette is more worried than she’s letting on to Gianni. It’s unlike</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred to be out of contact for long and even odder for his</p>
<p class="calibre1">receptionist to stonewall her, given that her apartment is the nearest</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing to a home he’s had for the past couple of years. But something</p>
<p class="calibre1">smells fishy. He sneaked out last night, saying it would be an</p>
<p class="calibre1">overnight trip, and now he’s not answering. Could it be his ex-wife?</p>
<p class="calibre1">she wonders, despite Gianni’s hints about a special mission. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">there’s been no word from Pamela other than the sarcastic cards she</p>
<p class="calibre1">dispatches every year without fail, timed to arrive on the birthday of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the daughter Manfred has never met. The music Mafiya? A letter bomb</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the Copyright Control Association of America? But no, his medical</p>
<p class="calibre1">monitor would have been screaming its head off if anything like that</p>
<p class="calibre1">had happened.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette has organized things so that he’s safe from the intellectual</p>
<p class="calibre1">property thieves. She’s lent him the support he needs, and he’s helped</p>
<p class="calibre1">her find her own path. She gets a warm sense of happiness whenever she</p>
<p class="calibre1">considers how much they’ve achieved together. But that’s exactly why</p>
<p class="calibre1">she’s worried now. The watchdog hasn’t barked …</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette summons a taxi to Charles de Gaulle. By the time she arrives,</p>
<p class="calibre1">she’s already used her parliamentary carte to bump an executive-class</p>
<p class="calibre1">seat on the next A320 to Turnhouse, Edinburgh’s airport, and scheduled</p>
<p class="calibre1">accommodation and transport for her arrival. The plane is climbing out</p>
<p class="calibre1">over la Manche before the significance of Gianni’s last comment hits</p>
<p class="calibre1">her: Might he think the Franklin Collective could be dangerous to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred?</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The hospital emergency suite has a waiting room with green plastic</p>
<p class="calibre1">bucket seats and subtractive volume renderings by preteens stuck to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the walls like surreal Lego sculptures. It’s deeply silent, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">available bandwidth all sequestrated for medical monitors - there are</p>
<p class="calibre1">children crying, periodic sirens wailing as ambulances draw up, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">people chattering all around him, but to Manfred, it’s like being at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the bottom of a deep blue pool of quiet. He feels stoned, except this</p>
<p class="calibre1">particular drug brings no euphoria or sense of well-being.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Corridor-corner vendors hawk kebab-spitted pigeons next to the chained</p>
<p class="calibre1">and rusted voluntary service booth; video cameras watch the blue bivvy</p>
<p class="calibre1">bags of the chronic cases lined up next to the nursing station. Alone</p>
<p class="calibre1">in his own head, Manfred is frightened and confused.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t check you in ‘less you sign the confidentiality agreement,”</p>
<p class="calibre1">says the triage nurse, pushing an antique tablet at Manfred’s face.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Service in the NHS is still free, but steps have been taken to reduce</p>
<p class="calibre1">the incidence of scandals: “Sign the nondisclosure clause here and</p>
<p class="calibre1">here, or the house officer won’t see you.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred stares blearily up at the nurse’s nose, which is red and</p>
<p class="calibre1">slightly inflamed from a nosocomial infection. His phones are</p>
<p class="calibre1">bickering again, and he can’t remember why; they don’t normally behave</p>
<p class="calibre1">like this, something must be missing, but thinking about it is hard.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why am I here?” he asks for the third time.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sign it.” A pen is thrust into his hand. He focuses on the page,</p>
<p class="calibre1">jerks upright as deeply canalized reflexes kick in.</p>

<p class="calibre1">and walks away. “Enjoy your wait!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred pulls out his backup phone and stares at its display.</p>

<p class="calibre1">twice, then staggers to his feet and heads off in search of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">toilet, his head spinning. He’s mumbling at his wrist watch: “Hello,</p>

<p class="calibre1">them, and Manfred instinctively turns to follow. They leave the A&amp;E</p>

<p class="calibre1">gentlemen, with a deranged distressed refugee from the twenty-first</p>
<p class="calibre1">century shuffling dizzily after. They’re all young, Manfred realizes</p>

<p class="calibre1">It took her precisely eighteen minutes to locate his hotel once she</p>

<p class="calibre1">Annette sighs. Manfred’s been upgrading this robot cat for years, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">his ex-wife Pamela used to mess with its neural configuration too:</p>
<p class="calibre1">This is its third body, and it’s getting more realistically</p>
<p class="calibre1">uncooperative with every hardware upgrade. Sooner or later it’s going</p>
<p class="calibre1">to demand a litter tray and start throwing up on the carpet. “Command</p>

<p class="calibre1">The door opens, and Macx finds himself confronted by a tall, slightly</p>
<p class="calibre1">cadaverous man wearing a tweed suit that has seen better days and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">clerical collar cut from a translucent circuit board. His face is</p>

<p class="calibre1">whispering questions and watching how his eyes focus: After a minute,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the room around him clears as the specs build a synthetic image to</p>
<p class="calibre1">compensate for his myopia. There’s limited Net access, too, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">notices, a warm sense of relief stealing over him. “Do you mind if I</p>
<p class="calibre1">call somebody?” he asks: “I want to check my backups.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be my guest.” Alan slips out through the door; Monica sits down</p>
<p class="calibre1">opposite him and stares into some inner space. The room has a tall</p>
<p class="calibre1">ceiling, with whitewashed walls and wooden shutters to cover the</p>
<p class="calibre1">aerogel window bays. The furniture is modern modular, and clashes</p>
<p class="calibre1">horribly with the original nineteenth-century architecture. “We were</p>
<p class="calibre1">expecting you.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You were -” He shifts track with an effort: “I was here to see</p>
<p class="calibre1">somebody. Here in Scotland, I mean.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Us.” She catches his eye deliberately. “To discuss sapience options</p>
<p class="calibre1">with our patron.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With your -” He squeezes his eyes shut. “Damn! I don’t remember. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">need my glasses back. Please.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What about your backups?” she asks curiously.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A moment.” Manfred tries to remember what address to ping. It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">useless, and painfully frustrating. “It would help if I could remember</p>
<p class="calibre1">where I keep the rest of my mind,” he complains. “It used to be at -</p>
<p class="calibre1">oh, there.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">An elephantine semantic network sits down on his spectacles as soon as</p>
<p class="calibre1">he asks for the site, crushing his surroundings into blocky pixilated</p>
<p class="calibre1">monochrome that jerks as he looks around. “This is going to take some</p>
<p class="calibre1">time,” he warns his hosts as a goodly chunk of his metacortex tries to</p>
<p class="calibre1">handshake with his brain over a wireless network connection that was</p>
<p class="calibre1">really only designed for web browsing. The download consists of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">part of his consciousness that isn’t security-critical - public access</p>
<p class="calibre1">actors and vague opinionated rants - but it clears down a huge memory</p>
<p class="calibre1">castle, sketching in the outline of a map of miracles and wonders onto</p>
<p class="calibre1">the whitewashed walls of the room.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Manfred can see the outside world again, he feels a bit more like</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself: He can, at least, spawn a search thread that will</p>
<p class="calibre1">resynchronize and fill him in on what it found. He still can’t access</p>
<p class="calibre1">the inner mysteries of his soul (including his personal memories);</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’re locked and barred pending biometric verification of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">identity and a quantum key exchange. But he has his wits about him</p>
<p class="calibre1">again - and some of them are even working. It’s like sobering up from</p>
<p class="calibre1">a strange new drug, the infinitely reassuring sense of being back at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the controls of his own head. “I think I need to report a crime,” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">tells Monica - or whoever is plugged into Monica’s head right now,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because now he knows where he is and who he was meant to meet</p>
<p class="calibre1">(although not why) - and he understands that, for the Franklin</p>
<p class="calibre1">Collective, identity is a politically loaded issue.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A crime report.” Her expression is subtly mocking. “Identity theft,</p>
<p class="calibre1">by any chance?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, yeah, I know: Identity is theft, don’t trust anyone whose state</p>
<p class="calibre1">vector hasn’t forked for more than a gigasecond, change is the only</p>
<p class="calibre1">constant, et bloody cetera. Who am I talking to, by the way? And if</p>
<p class="calibre1">we’re talking, doesn’t that signify that you think we’re on the same</p>
<p class="calibre1">side, more or less?” He struggles to sit up in the recliner chair:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Stepper motors whine softly as it strives to accommodate him.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sidedness is optional.” The woman who is Monica some of the time</p>
<p class="calibre1">looks at him quirkily: “It tends to alter drastically if you vary the</p>
<p class="calibre1">number of dimensions. Let’s just say that right now I’m Monica, plus</p>
<p class="calibre1">our sponsor. Will that do you?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our sponsor, who is in cyberspace -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She leans back on the sofa, which buzzes and extrudes an occasional</p>
<p class="calibre1">table with a small bar. “Drink? Can I offer you coffee? Guarana? Or</p>
<p class="calibre1">maybe a Berlinerweisse, for old time’s sake?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Guarana will do. Hello, Bob. How long have you been dead?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She chuckles. “I’m not dead, Manny. I may not be a full upload, but I</p>
<p class="calibre1">feel like me.” She rolls her eyes, self-consciously. “He’s making rude</p>
<p class="calibre1">comments about your wife,” She adds; “I’m not going to pass that on.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My ex-wife,” Manfred corrects her automatically. “The, uh, tax vamp.</p>
<p class="calibre1">So. You’re acting as a, I guess, an interpreter for Bob?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ack.” She looks at Manfred very seriously: “We owe him a lot, you</p>
<p class="calibre1">know. He left his assets in trust to the movement along with his</p>
<p class="calibre1">partials. We feel obliged to instantiate his personality as often as</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible, even though you can only do so much with a couple of</p>
<p class="calibre1">petabytes of recordings. But we have help.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The lobsters.” Manfred nods to himself and accepts the glass that she</p>
<p class="calibre1">offers. Its diamond-plated curves glitter brilliantly in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">late-afternoon sunlight. “I knew this had something to do with them.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">He leans forward, holding his glass and frowns. “If only I could</p>
<p class="calibre1">remember why I came here! It was something emergent, something in deep</p>
<p class="calibre1">memory … something I didn’t trust in my own skull. Something to do</p>
<p class="calibre1">with Bob.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The door behind the sofa opens; Alan enters. “Excuse me,” he says</p>
<p class="calibre1">quietly, and heads for the far side of the room. A workstation folds</p>
<p class="calibre1">down from the wall, and a chair rolls in from a service niche. He sits</p>
<p class="calibre1">with his chin propped on his hands, staring at the white desktop.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Every so often he mutters quietly to himself; “Yes, I understand …</p>
<p class="calibre1">campaign headquarters … donations need to be audited …”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gianni’s election campaign,” Monica prompts him.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred jumps. “Gianni -” A bundle of memories unlock inside his head</p>
<p class="calibre1">as he remembers his political front man’s message. “Yes! That’s what</p>
<p class="calibre1">this is about. It has to be!” He looks at her excitedly. “I’m here to</p>
<p class="calibre1">deliver a message to you from Gianni Vittoria. About -” He looks</p>
<p class="calibre1">crestfallen. “I’m not sure,” he trails off uncertainly, “but it was</p>
<p class="calibre1">important. Something critical in the long term, something about group</p>
<p class="calibre1">minds and voting. But whoever mugged me got the message.”</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Grassmarket is an overly rustic cobbled square nestled beneath the</p>
<p class="calibre1">glowering battlements of Castle Rock. Annette stands on the site of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the gallows where they used to execute witches; she sends forth her</p>
<p class="calibre1">invisible agents to search for spoor of Manfred. Aineko, overly</p>
<p class="calibre1">familiar, drapes over her left shoulder like a satanic stole and</p>
<p class="calibre1">delivers a running stream of cracked cellphone chatter into her ear.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know where to begin,” she sighs, annoyed. This place is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">wall-to-wall tourist trap, a many-bladed carnivorous plant that</p>
<p class="calibre1">digests easy credit and spits out the drained husks of foreigners. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">road has been pedestrianized and resurfaced in squalidly authentic</p>
<p class="calibre1">mediaeval cobblestones; in the middle of what used to be the car park,</p>
<p class="calibre1">there’s a permanent floating antiques market, where you can buy</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything from a brass fire surround to an ancient CD player. Much of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the merchandise in the shops is generic dot-com trash, vying for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">title of Japanese-Scottish souvenir from hell: Puroland tartans,</p>
<p class="calibre1">animatronic Nessies hissing bad-temperedly at knee level, second hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">laptops. People swarm everywhere, from the theme pubs (hangings seem</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be a running joke hereabouts) to the expensive dress shops with</p>
<p class="calibre1">their fabric renderers and digital mirrors. Street performers, part of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the permanent floating Fringe, clutter the sidewalk: A robotic mime,</p>
<p class="calibre1">very traditional in silver face paint, mimics the gestures of passers</p>
<p class="calibre1">by with ironically stylized gestures.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Try the doss house,” Aineko suggests from the shelter of her shoulder</p>
<p class="calibre1">bag.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The -” Annette does a doubletake as her thesaurus conspires with her</p>
<p class="calibre1">open government firmware and dumps a geographical database of city</p>
<p class="calibre1">social services into her sensorium. “Oh, I see.” The Grassmarket</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself is touristy, but the bits off to one end - down a dingy canyon</p>
<p class="calibre1">of forbidding stone buildings six stories high - are decidedly</p>
<p class="calibre1">downmarket. “Okay.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette weaves past a stall selling disposable cellphones and cheaper</p>
<p class="calibre1">genome explorers, round a gaggle of teenage girls in the grips of some</p>
<p class="calibre1">kind of imported kawaii fetish, who look at her in alarm from atop</p>
<p class="calibre1">their pink platform heels - probably mistaking her for a school</p>
<p class="calibre1">probation inspector - and past a stand of chained and parked bicycles.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The human attendant looks bored out of her mind. Annette tucks a</p>
<p class="calibre1">blandly anonymous ten-Euro note in her pocket almost before she</p>
<p class="calibre1">notices: “If you were going to buy a hot bike,” she asks, “where would</p>
<p class="calibre1">you go?” The parking attendant stares, and for a moment Annette thinks</p>
<p class="calibre1">she’s overestimated her. Then she mumbles something. “What?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“McMurphy’s. Used to be called Bannerman’s. Down yon Cowgate,</p>
<p class="calibre1">thataway.” The meter maid looks anxiously at her rack of charges. “You</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh-huh.” Annette follows her gaze: straight down the dark stone</p>
<p class="calibre1">canyon. Well, okay. “This had better be worth it, Manny mon ch�r,” she</p>
<p class="calibre1">mutters under her breath.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">McMurphy’s is a fake Irish pub, a stone grotto installed beneath a</p>
<p class="calibre1">mound of blank-faced offices. It was once a real Irish pub before the</p>
<p class="calibre1">developers got their hands on it and mutated it in rapid succession</p>
<p class="calibre1">into a punk nightclub, a wine bar, and a fake Dutch coffee shop; after</p>
<p class="calibre1">which, as burned-out as any star, it left the main sequence. Now it</p>
<p class="calibre1">occupies an unnaturally prolonged, chilly existence as the sort of</p>
<p class="calibre1">recycled imitation Irish pub that has neon four-leafed clovers hanging</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the artificially blackened pine beams above the log tables - in</p>
<p class="calibre1">other words, the burned-out black dwarf afterlife of a once-serious</p>
<p class="calibre1">drinking establishment. Somewhere along the line, the beer cellar was</p>
<p class="calibre1">replaced with a toilet (leaving more room for paying patrons</p>
<p class="calibre1">upstairs), and now its founts dispense fizzy concentrate diluted with</p>
<p class="calibre1">water from the city mains.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Say, did you hear the one about the Eurocrat with the robot pussy who</p>
<p class="calibre1">goes into a dodgy pub on the Cowgate and orders a coke? And when it</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrives, she says ‘hey, where’s the mirror?’”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shut up,” Annette hisses into her shoulder bag. “That isn’t funny.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her personal intruder telemetry has just emailed her wristphone, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s displaying a rotating yellow exclamation point, which means that</p>
<p class="calibre1">according to the published police crime stats, this place is likely to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do grievous harm to her insurance premiums.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko looks up at her from his nest in the bag and yawns cavernously,</p>
<p class="calibre1">baring a pink, ribbed mouth and a tongue like pink suede. “Want to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make me? I just pinged Manny’s head. The network latency was trivial.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The barmaid sidles up and pointedly manages not to make eye contact</p>
<p class="calibre1">with Annette. “I’ll have a Diet Coke,” Annette orders. In the</p>
<p class="calibre1">direction of her bag, voice pitched low: “Did you hear the one about</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Eurocrat who goes into a dodgy pub, orders half a liter of Diet</p>
<p class="calibre1">Coke, and when she spills it in her shoulder bag she says ‘oops, I’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">got a wet pussy’?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Coke arrives. Annette pays for it. There may be a couple of dozen</p>
<p class="calibre1">people in the pub; it’s hard to tell because it looks like an ancient</p>
<p class="calibre1">cellar, lots of stone archways leading off into niches populated with</p>
<p class="calibre1">secondhand church pews and knife-scarred tables. Some guys who might</p>
<p class="calibre1">be bikers, students, or well-dressed winos are hunched over one table:</p>
<p class="calibre1">hairy, wearing vests with too many pockets, in an artful bohemianism</p>
<p class="calibre1">that makes Annette blink until one of her literary programs informs</p>
<p class="calibre1">her that one of them is a moderately famous local writer, a bit of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">guru for the space and freedom party. There’re a couple of women in</p>
<p class="calibre1">boots and furry hats in one corner, poring over the menu, and a parcel</p>
<p class="calibre1">of off-duty street performers hunching over their beers in a booth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nobody else is wearing anything remotely like office drag, but the</p>
<p class="calibre1">weirdness coefficient is above average; so Annette dials her glasses</p>
<p class="calibre1">to extra-dark, straightens her tie, and glances around.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The door opens and a nondescript youth slinks in. He’s wearing baggy</p>
<p class="calibre1">BDUs, woolly cap, and a pair of boots that have that quintessential</p>
<p class="calibre1">essense de panzer division look, all shock absorbers and olive drab</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kevlar panels. He’s wearing -</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I spy with my little network intrusion detector kit,” begins the cat,</p>
<p class="calibre1">as Annette puts her drink down and moves in on the youth, “something</p>
<p class="calibre1">beginning with -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How much you want for the glasses, kid?” she asks quietly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He jerks and almost jumps - a bad idea in MilSpec combat boots, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ceiling is eighteenth-century stone half a meter thick; “Dinnae</p>
<p class="calibre1">fuckin’ dae that,” he complains in an eerily familiar way: “Ah -” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">swallows. “Annie! Who -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stay calm. Take them off - they’ll only hurt you if you keep wearing</p>
<p class="calibre1">them,” she says, careful not to move too fast because now she has a</p>
<p class="calibre1">second, scary-jittery fear, and she knows without having to look that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the exclamation mark on her watch has turned red and begun to flash:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look, I’ll give you two hundred Euros for the glasses and the belt</p>
<p class="calibre1">pouch, real cash, and I won’t ask how you got them or tell anyone.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s frozen in front of her, mesmerized, and she can see the light</p>
<p class="calibre1">from inside the lenses spilling over onto his half-starved adolescent</p>
<p class="calibre1">cheekbones, flickering like cold lightning, like he’s plugged his</p>
<p class="calibre1">brain into a grid bearer; swallowing with a suddenly dry mouth, she</p>
<p class="calibre1">slowly reaches up and pulls the spectacles off his face with one hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">and takes hold of the belt pouch with the other. The kid shudders and</p>
<p class="calibre1">blinks at her, and she sticks a couple of hundred-Euro notes in front</p>
<p class="calibre1">of his nose. “Scram,” she says, not unkindly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He reaches up slowly, then seizes the money and runs - blasts his way</p>
<p class="calibre1">through the door with an ear-popping concussion, hangs a left onto the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cycle path, and vanishes downhill toward the parliament buildings and</p>
<p class="calibre1">university complex.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette watches the doorway apprehensively. “Where is he?” she hisses,</p>
<p class="calibre1">worried: “Any ideas, cat?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Naah. It’s your job to find him,” Aineko opines complacently. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">there’s an icicle of anxiety in Annette’s spine. Manfred’s been</p>
<p class="calibre1">separated from his memory cache? Where could he be? Worse - who could</p>
<p class="calibre1">he be?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fuck you, too,” she mutters. “Only one thing for it, I guess.” She</p>
<p class="calibre1">takes off her own glasses - they’re much less functional than</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred’s massively ramified custom rig - and nervously raises the</p>
<p class="calibre1">repo’d specs toward her face. Somehow what she’s about to do makes her</p>
<p class="calibre1">feel unclean, like snooping on a lover’s e-mail folders. But how else</p>
<p class="calibre1">can she figure out where he might have gone?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>

<p class="calibre1">Paleolithic hangover takes exception to the robotic mime aping his</p>

<p class="calibre1">much shouting in the mutually incomprehensible accents of Oxgangs and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Herriott-Watt Robot Lab. Annette watches the fight and shudders;</p>

<p class="calibre1">Manfred can feel one of his attacks coming on. The usual symptoms are</p>
<p class="calibre1">all present - the universe, with its vast preponderance of unthinking</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter, becomes an affront; weird ideas flicker like heat lightning</p>
<p class="calibre1">far away across the vast plateaus of his imagination - but, with his</p>
<p class="calibre1">metacortex running in sandboxed insecure mode, he feels blunt. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">slow. Even obsolete. The latter is about as welcome a sensation as</p>
<p class="calibre1">heroin withdrawal: He can’t spin off threads to explore his designs</p>
<p class="calibre1">for feasibility and report back to him. It’s like someone has stripped</p>
<p class="calibre1">fifty points off his IQ; his brain feels like a surgical scalpel</p>
<p class="calibre1">that’s been used to cut down trees. A decaying mind is a terrible</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing to be trapped inside. Manfred wants out, and he wants out bad -</p>
<p class="calibre1">but he’s too afraid to let on.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gianni is a middle-of-the-road Eurosocialist, a mixed-market</p>

<p class="calibre1">dye-flushed lips, “hardly the sort of guy you’d expect me to vote for,</p>
<p class="calibre1">no? So what does he think I can do for him?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s a - ah - ” Manfred rocks forward and back in his chair, arms</p>
<p class="calibre1">crossed firmly and hands thrust under his armpits for protection.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dismantle the moon! Digitize the biosphere, make a n�osphere out of</p>

<p class="calibre1">um, not pissing around with Molotov cocktails and thought police: He</p>
<p class="calibre1">wants to make everybody so rich that squabbling over ownership of the</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alan glances over his shoulder at Manfred: “I don’t think feeding him</p>
<p class="calibre1">guarana was a good idea,” he says in tones of deep foreboding.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred’s mode of vibration has gone nonlinear by this point: He’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">rocking front to back, and jiggling up and down in little hops, like a</p>
<p class="calibre1">technophiliacal yogic flyer trying to bounce his way to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">singularity. Monica leans toward him and her eyes widen: “Manfred,”</p>
<p class="calibre1">she hisses, “shut up!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He stops babbling abruptly, with an expression of deep puzzlement.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who am I?” he asks, and keels over backward. “Why am I, here and now,</p>
<p class="calibre1">occupying this body -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anthropic anxiety attack,” Monica comments. “I think he did this in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amsterdam eight years ago when Bob first met him.” She looks alarmed,</p>
<p class="calibre1">a different identity coming to the fore: “What shall we do?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We have to make him comfortable.” Alan raises his voice: “Bed, make</p>
<p class="calibre1">yourself ready, now.” The back of the sofa Manfred is sprawled on</p>
<p class="calibre1">flops downward, the base folds up, and a strangely animated duvet</p>
<p class="calibre1">crawls up over his feet. “Listen, Manny, you’re going to be all</p>
<p class="calibre1">right.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who am I and what do I signify?” Manfred mumbles incoherently: “A</p>
<p class="calibre1">mass of propagating decision trees, fractal compression, lots of</p>
<p class="calibre1">synaptic junctions lubricated with friendly endorphins -” Across the</p>
<p class="calibre1">room, the bootleg pharmacopoeia is cranking up to manufacture some</p>
<p class="calibre1">heavy tranquilizers. Monica heads for the kitchen to get something for</p>
<p class="calibre1">him to drink them in. “Why are you doing this?” Manfred asks, dizzily.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s okay. Lie down and relax.” Alan leans over him. “We’ll talk</p>
<p class="calibre1">about everything in the morning, when you know who you are.” (Aside to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Monica, who is entering the room with a bottle of iced tea: “Better</p>
<p class="calibre1">let Gianni know that he’s unwell. One of us may have to go visit the</p>
<p class="calibre1">minister. Do you know if Macx has been audited?”) “Rest up, Manfred.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything is being taken care of.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">About fifteen minutes later, Manfred - who, in the grip of an</p>
<p class="calibre1">existential migraine, meekly obeys Monica’s instruction to drink down</p>
<p class="calibre1">the spiked tea - lies back on the bed and relaxes. His breathing</p>
<p class="calibre1">slows; the subliminal muttering ceases. Monica, sitting next to him,</p>
<p class="calibre1">reaches out and takes his right hand, which is lying on top of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bedding.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>

<p class="calibre1">Nightfall in the city. Annette stands impatiently on the doorstep.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let me the fuck in,” she snarls impatiently at the speakerphone.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Merde!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone opens the door. “Who -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette shoves him inside, kicks the door shut, and leans on it. “Take</p>
<p class="calibre1">me to your bodhisattva,” she demands. “Now.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I -” he turns and heads inside, along the gloomy hallway that runs</p>
<p class="calibre1">past a staircase. Annette strides after him aggressively. He opens a</p>
<p class="calibre1">door and ducks inside, and she follows before he can close it.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside, the room is illuminated by a variety of indirect diode</p>
<p class="calibre1">sources, calibrated for the warm glow of a summer afternoon’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">daylight. There’s a bed in the middle of it, a figure lying asleep at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the heart of a herd of attentive diagnostic instruments. A couple of</p>
<p class="calibre1">attendants sit to either side of the sleeping man.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What have you done to him?” Annette snaps, rushing forward. Manfred</p>
<p class="calibre1">blinks up at her from the pillows, bleary-eyed and confused as she</p>
<p class="calibre1">leans overhead: “Hello? Manny?” Over her shoulder: “If you have done</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything to him -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Annie?” He looks puzzled. A bright orange pair of goggles - not his</p>

<p class="calibre1">“I don’t feel well. ‘F I get my hands on the bastard who did this …”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We can fix that,” she says briskly, declining to mention the deal she</p>
<p class="calibre1">cut to get his memories back. She peels off his glasses and carefully</p>
<p class="calibre1">slides them onto his face, replacing his temporary ones. The brain bag</p>
<p class="calibre1">she puts down next to his shoulder, within easy range. The hairs on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the back of her neck rise as a thin chattering fills the ether around</p>
<p class="calibre1">them: his eyes are glowing a luminous blue behind his shades, as if a</p>
<p class="calibre1">high-tension spark is flying between his ears.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh. Wow.” He sits up, the covers fall from his naked shoulders, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">her breath catches.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looks round at the motionless figure sitting to his left. The man</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the chair nods deliberately, ironically. “What have you done to</p>
<p class="calibre1">him?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ve been looking after him - nothing more, nothing less. He arrived</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’s never met this fellow before, but she has a gut feeling that she</p>

<p class="calibre1">He nods again. “The avatar is in.” There’s a thud as Manfred’s eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">roll up in his head, and he flops back onto the bedding. “Excuse me.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Monica?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The young woman on the other side of the bed shakes her head. “No, I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">running Bob, too.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh. Well, you tell her - I’ve got to get him some juice.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The woman who is also Bob Franklin - or whatever part of him survived</p>
<p class="calibre1">his battle with an exotic brain tumor eight years earlier - catches</p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette’s eye and shakes her head, smiles faintly. “You’re never alone</p>
<p class="calibre1">when you’re a syncitium.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette wrinkles her brow: she has to trigger a dictionary attack to</p>
<p class="calibre1">parse the sentence. “One large cell, many nuclei? Oh, I see. You have</p>
<p class="calibre1">the new implant. The better to record everything.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The youngster shrugs. “You want to die and be resurrected as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">third-person actor in a low-bandwidth re-enactment? Or a shadow of</p>
<p class="calibre1">itchy memories in some stranger’s skull?” She snorts, a gesture that’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">at odds with the rest of her body language.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bob must have been one of the first borganisms. Humans, I mean. After</p>
<p class="calibre1">Jim Bezier.” Annette glances over at Manfred, who has begun to snore</p>
<p class="calibre1">softly. “It must have been a lot of work.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The monitoring equipment cost millions, then,” says the woman -</p>
<p class="calibre1">Monica? - “and it didn’t do a very good job. One of the conditions for</p>
<p class="calibre1">our keeping access to his research funding is that we regularly run</p>
<p class="calibre1">his partials. He wanted to build up a kind of aggregate state vector -</p>
<p class="calibre1">patched together out of bits and pieces of other people to supplement</p>
<p class="calibre1">the partials that were all I - he - could record with the then state</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the art.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eh, right.” Annette reaches out and absently smooths a stray hair</p>
<p class="calibre1">away from Manfred’s forehead. “What is it like to be part of a group</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Monica sniffs, evidently amused. “What is it like to see red? What’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">it like to be a bat? I can’t tell you - I can only show you. We’re all</p>
<p class="calibre1">free to leave at any time, you know.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But somehow you don’t.” Annette rubs her head, feels the short hair</p>
<p class="calibre1">over the almost imperceptible scars that conceal a network of implants</p>
<p class="calibre1">- tools that Manfred turned down when they became available a year or</p>
<p class="calibre1">two ago. (“Goop-phase Darwin-design nanotech ain’t designed for clean</p>
<p class="calibre1">interfaces,” he’d said, “I’ll stick to disposable kit, thanks.”) “No</p>
<p class="calibre1">thank you. I don’t think he’ll take up your offer when he wakes up,</p>
<p class="calibre1">either.” (Subtext: I’ll let you have him over my dead body.)</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Monica shrugs. “That’s his loss: He won’t live forever in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">singularity, along with other followers of our gentle teacher. Anyway,</p>
<p class="calibre1">we have more converts than we know what to do with.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">A thought occurs to Annette. “Ah. You are all of one mind? Partially?</p>
<p class="calibre1">A question to you is a question to all?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It can be.” The words come simultaneously from Monica and the other</p>
<p class="calibre1">body, Alan, who is standing in the doorway with a boxy thing that</p>
<p class="calibre1">looks like an improvised diagnostician. “What do you have in mind?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">adds the Alan body.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred, lying on the bed, groans: There’s an audible hiss of pink</p>
<p class="calibre1">noise as his glasses whisper in his ears, bone conduction providing a</p>
<p class="calibre1">serial highway to his wetware.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Manfred was sent to find out why you’re opposing the ERA,” Annette</p>
<p class="calibre1">explains. “Some parts of our team operate without the other’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Indeed.” Alan sits down on the chair beside the bed and clears his</p>
<p class="calibre1">throat, puffing his chest out pompously. “A very important theological</p>
<p class="calibre1">issue. I feel -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I, or we?” Annette interrupts.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We feel,” Monica snaps. Then she glances at Alan. “Soo-rrry.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The evidence of individuality within the group mind is disturbing to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette: Too many reruns of the Borgish fantasy have conditioned her</p>
<p class="calibre1">preconceptions, and their quasi-religious belief in a singularity</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaves her cold. “Please continue.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One person, one vote, is obsolete,” says Alan. “The broader issue of</p>
<p class="calibre1">how we value identity needs to be revisited, the franchise</p>
<p class="calibre1">reconsidered. Do you get one vote for each warm body? Or one vote for</p>
<p class="calibre1">each sapient individual? What about distributed intelligences? The</p>
<p class="calibre1">proposals in the Equal Rights Act are deeply flawed, based on a cult</p>
<p class="calibre1">of individuality that takes no account of the true complexity of</p>
<p class="calibre1">posthumanism.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like the proposals for a feminine franchise in the nineteenth century</p>
<p class="calibre1">that would grant the vote to married wives of land-owning men,” Monica</p>
<p class="calibre1">adds slyly: “It misses the point.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, oui.” Annette crosses her arms, suddenly defensive. This isn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">what she’d expected to hear. This is the elitist side of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">posthumanism shtick, potentially as threatening to her post</p>
<p class="calibre1">enlightenment ideas as the divine right of kings.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It misses more than that.” Heads turn to face an unexpected</p>
<p class="calibre1">direction: Manfred’s eyes are open again, and as he glances around the</p>
<p class="calibre1">room Annette can see a spark of interest there that was missing</p>
<p class="calibre1">earlier. “Last century, people were paying to have their heads frozen</p>
<p class="calibre1">after their death - in hope of reconstruction, later. They got no</p>
<p class="calibre1">civil rights: The law didn’t recognize death as a reversible process.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now how do we account for it when you guys stop running Bob? Opt out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the collective borganism? Or maybe opt back in again later?” He</p>
<p class="calibre1">reaches up and rubs his forehead, tiredly. “Sorry, I haven’t been</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself lately.” A crooked, slightly manic grin flickers across his</p>
<p class="calibre1">face. “See, I’ve been telling Gianni for a whole while, we need a new</p>
<p class="calibre1">legal concept of what it is to be a person. One that can cope with</p>
<p class="calibre1">sentient corporations, artificial stupidities, secessionists from</p>
<p class="calibre1">group minds, and reincarnated uploads. The religiously inclined are</p>
<p class="calibre1">having lots of fun with identity issues right now - why aren’t we</p>
<p class="calibre1">posthumanists thinking about these things?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette’s bag bulges: Aineko pokes his head out, sniffs the air,</p>
<p class="calibre1">squeezes out onto the carpet, and begins to groom himself with perfect</p>
<p class="calibre1">disregard for the human bystanders. “Not to mention A-life experiments</p>
<p class="calibre1">who think they’re the real thing,” Manfred adds. “And aliens.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette freezes, staring at him. “Manfred! You’re not supposed to -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred is watching Alan, who seems to be the most deeply integrated</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the dead venture billionaire’s executors: Even his expression</p>
<p class="calibre1">reminds Annette of meeting Bob Franklin back in Amsterdam, early in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the decade, when Manny’s personal dragon still owned him. “Aliens,”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Alan echoes. An eyebrow twitches. “Would this be the signal SETI</p>
<p class="calibre1">announced, or the, uh, other one? And how long have you known about</p>
<p class="calibre1">them?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gianni has his fingers in a lot of pies,” Manfred comments blandly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“And we still talk to the lobsters from time to time - you know,</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’re only a couple of light-hours away, right? They told us about</p>
<p class="calibre1">the signals.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Er.” Alan’s eyes glaze over for a moment; Annette’s prostheses paint</p>
<p class="calibre1">her a picture of false light spraying from the back of his head, his</p>
<p class="calibre1">entire sensory bandwidth momentarily soaking up a huge peer-to-peer</p>
<p class="calibre1">download from the server dust that wallpapers every room in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">building. Monica looks irritated, taps her fingernails on the back of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her chair. “The signals. Right. Why wasn’t this publicized?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The first one was.” Annette’s eyebrows furrow. “We couldn’t exactly</p>
<p class="calibre1">cover it up, everyone with a backyard dish pointed in the right</p>
<p class="calibre1">direction caught it. But most people who’re interested in hearing</p>
<p class="calibre1">about alien contacts already think they drop round on alternate</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tuesdays and Thursdays to administer rectal exams. Most of the rest</p>
<p class="calibre1">think it’s a hoax. Quite a few of the remainder are scratching their</p>
<p class="calibre1">heads and wondering whether it isn’t just a new kind of cosmological</p>
<p class="calibre1">phenomenon that emits a very low entropy signal. Of the six who are</p>
<p class="calibre1">left over, five are trying to get a handle on the message contents,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the last is convinced it’s a practical joke. And the other signal,</p>
<p class="calibre1">well, that was weak enough that only the deep-space tracking network</p>
<p class="calibre1">caught it.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred fiddles with the bed control system. “It’s not a practical</p>
<p class="calibre1">joke,” he adds. “But they only captured about sixteen megabits of data</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the first one, maybe double that in the second. There’s quite a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bit of noise, the signals don’t repeat, their length doesn’t appear to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be a prime, there’s no obvious metainformation that describes the</p>
<p class="calibre1">internal format, so there’s no easy way of getting a handle on them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">To make matters worse, pointy-haired management at Arianespace” - he</p>
<p class="calibre1">glances at Annette, as if seeking a response to the naming of her</p>
<p class="calibre1">ex-employers - “decided the best thing to do was to cover up the</p>
<p class="calibre1">second signal and work on it in secret - for competitive advantage,</p>
<p class="calibre1">they say - and as for the first, to pretend it never happened. So</p>
<p class="calibre1">nobody really knows how long it’ll take to figure out whether it’s a</p>
<p class="calibre1">ping from the galactic root domain servers or a pulsar that’s taken to</p>
<p class="calibre1">grinding out the eighteen-quadrillionth digits of pi, or what.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But,” Monica glances around, “you can’t be sure.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think it may be sapient,” says Manfred. He finds the right button</p>
<p class="calibre1">at last, and the bed begins to fold itself back into a lounger. Then</p>
<p class="calibre1">he finds the wrong button; the duvet dissolves into viscous turquoise</p>
<p class="calibre1">slime that slurps and gurgles away through a multitude of tiny nozzles</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the headboard. “Bloody aerogel. Um, where was I?” He sits up.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sapient network packet?” asks Alan.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope.” Manfred shakes his head, grins. “Should have known you’d read</p>
<p class="calibre1">Vinge … or was it the movie? No, what I think is that there’s only</p>
<p class="calibre1">one logical thing to beam backward and forward out there, and you may</p>
<p class="calibre1">remember I asked you to beam it out about, oh, nine years ago?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The lobsters.” Alan’s eyes go blank. “Nine years. Time to Proxima</p>
<p class="calibre1">Centauri and back?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About that distance, yes,” says Manfred. “And remember, that’s an</p>
<p class="calibre1">upper bound - it could well have come from somewhere closer. Anyway,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the first SETI signal came from a couple of degrees off and more than</p>
<p class="calibre1">hundred light-years out, but the second signal came from less than</p>
<p class="calibre1">three light-years away. You can see why they didn’t publicize that -</p>
<p class="calibre1">they didn’t want a panic. And no, the signal isn’t a simple echo of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the canned crusty transmission - I think it’s an exchange embassy, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">we haven’t cracked it yet. Now do you see why we have to crowbar the</p>
<p class="calibre1">civil rights issue open again? We need a framework for rights that can</p>
<p class="calibre1">encompass nonhumans, and we need it as fast as possible. Otherwise, if</p>
<p class="calibre1">the neighbors come visiting…”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,” says Alan, “I’ll have to talk with myselves. Maybe we can</p>
<p class="calibre1">agree something, as long as it’s clear that it’s a provisional stab at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the framework and not a permanent solution?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette snorts. “No solution is final!” Monica catches her eyes and</p>
<p class="calibre1">winks: Annette is startled by the blatant display of dissent within</p>
<p class="calibre1">the syncitium.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,” says Manfred, “I guess that’s all we can ask for?” He looks</p>
<p class="calibre1">hopeful. “Thanks for the hospitality, but I feel the need to lie down</p>
<p class="calibre1">in my own bed for a while. I had to commit a lot to memory while I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">off-line, and I want to record it before I forget who I am,” he adds</p>
<p class="calibre1">pointedly, and Annette breathes a quiet sight of relief.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later that night, a doorbell rings.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who’s there?” asks the entryphone.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh, me,” says the man on the steps. He looks a little confused. “Ah’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">Macx. Ah’m here tae see” - the name is on the tip of his tongue -</p>
<p class="calibre1">“someone.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come in.” A solenoid buzzes; he pushes the door open, and it closes</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind him. His metal-shod boots ring on the hard stone floor, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cool air smells faintly of unburned jet fuel.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah’m Macx,” he repeats uncertainly, “or Ah wis fer a wee while, an’</p>
<p class="calibre1">it made ma heid hurt. But noo Ah’m me agin, an’ Ah wannae be somebody</p>
<p class="calibre1">else … can ye help?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later still, a cat sits on a window ledge, watching the interior of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">darkened room from behind the concealment of curtains. The room is</p>
<p class="calibre1">dark to human eyes, but bright to the cat: Moonlight cascades silently</p>
<p class="calibre1">off the walls and furniture, the twisted bedding, the two naked humans</p>
<p class="calibre1">lying curled together in the middle of the bed.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both the humans are in their thirties: Her close-cropped hair is</p>
<p class="calibre1">beginning to gray, distinguished threads of gunmetal wire threading</p>
<p class="calibre1">it, while his brown mop is not yet showing signs of age. To the cat,</p>
<p class="calibre1">who watches with a variety of unnatural senses, her head glows in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">microwave spectrum with a gentle halo of polarized emissions. The male</p>
<p class="calibre1">shows no such aura: he’s unnaturally natural for this day and age,</p>
<p class="calibre1">although - oddly - he’s wearing spectacles in bed, and the frames</p>
<p class="calibre1">shine similarly. An invisible soup of radiation connects both humans</p>
<p class="calibre1">to items of clothing scattered across the room - clothing that seethes</p>
<p class="calibre1">with unsleeping sentience, dribbling over to their suitcases and hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">luggage and (though it doesn’t enjoy noticing it) the cat’s tail,</p>
<p class="calibre1">which is itself a rather sensitive antenna.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two humans have just finished making love: They do this less often</p>
<p class="calibre1">than in their first few years, but with more tenderness and expertise</p>
<p class="calibre1">- lengths of shocking pink Hello Kitty bondage tape still hang from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the bedposts, and a lump of programmable memory plastic sits cooling</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the side table. The male is sprawled with his head and upper torso</p>
<p class="calibre1">resting in the crook of the female’s left arm and shoulder. Shifting</p>
<p class="calibre1">visualization to infrared, the cat sees that she is glowing,</p>
<p class="calibre1">capillaries dilating to enhance the blood flow around her throat and</p>
<p class="calibre1">chest.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m getting old,” the male mumbles. “I’m slowing down.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not where it counts,” the female replies, gently squeezing his right</p>
<p class="calibre1">buttock.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I’m sure of it,” he says. “The bits of me that still exist in</p>
<p class="calibre1">this old head - how many types of processor can you name that are</p>
<p class="calibre1">still in use thirty-plus years after they’re born?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re thinking about the implants again,” she says carefully. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">cat remembers this as a sore point; from being a medical procedure to</p>
<p class="calibre1">help the blind see and the autistic talk, intrathecal implants have</p>
<p class="calibre1">blossomed into a must-have accessory for the now-clade. But the male</p>
<p class="calibre1">is reluctant. “It’s not as risky as it used to be. If they screw up,</p>
<p class="calibre1">there’re neural growth cofactors and cheap replacement stem cells. I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">sure one of your sponsors can arrange for extra cover.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hush: I’m still thinking about it.” He’s silent for a while. “I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t myself yesterday. I was someone else. Someone too slow to keep</p>
<p class="calibre1">up. Puts a new perspective on everything: I’ve been afraid of losing</p>
<p class="calibre1">my biological plasticity, of being trapped in an obsolete chunk of</p>
<p class="calibre1">skullware while everything moves on - but how much of me lives outside</p>
<p class="calibre1">my own head these days, anyhow?” One of his external threads generates</p>
<p class="calibre1">an animated glyph and throws it at her mind’s eye; she grins at his</p>
<p class="calibre1">obscure humor. “Cross-training from a new interface is going to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">hard, though.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll do it,” she predicts. “You can always get a discreet</p>
<p class="calibre1">prescription for novotrophin-B.” A receptor agonist tailored for</p>
<p class="calibre1">gerontological wards, it stimulates interest in the new: combined with</p>
<p class="calibre1">MDMA, it’s a component of the street cocktail called sensawunda. “That</p>
<p class="calibre1">should keep you focused for long enough to get comfortable.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s life coming to when I can’t cope with the pace of change?” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">asks the ceiling plaintively.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat lashes its tail, irritated by his anthropocentrism.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You are my futurological storm shield,” she says, jokingly, and moves</p>
<p class="calibre1">her hand to cup his genitals. Most of her current activities are</p>
<p class="calibre1">purely biological, the cat notes: From the irregular sideloads, she’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">using most of her skullware to run ETItalk@home, one of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">distributed cracking engines that is trying to decode the alien</p>
<p class="calibre1">grammar of the message that Manfred suspects is eligible for</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizenship.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obeying an urge that it can’t articulate, the cat sends out a feeler</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the nearest router. The cybeast has Manfred’s keys; Manfred trusts</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko implicitly, which is unwise - his ex-wife tampered with it,</p>
<p class="calibre1">after all, never mind all the kittens it absorbed in its youth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Tunneling out into the darkness, the cat stalks the Net alone …</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just think about the people who can’t adapt,” he says. His voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">sounds obscurely worried.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I try not to.” She shivers. “You are thirty, you are slowing. What</p>
<p class="calibre1">about the young? Are they keeping up, themselves?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have a daughter. She’s about a hundred and sixty million seconds</p>
<p class="calibre1">old. If Pamela would let me message her I could find out …” There</p>
<p class="calibre1">are echoes of old pain in his voice.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t go there, Manfred. Please.” Despite everything, Manfred hasn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">let go: Amber is a ligature that permanently binds him to Pamela’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">distant orbit.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the distance, the cat hears the sound of lobster minds singing in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the void, a distant feed streaming from their cometary home as it</p>
<p class="calibre1">drifts silently out through the asteroid belt, en route to a chilly</p>
<p class="calibre1">encounter beyond Neptune. The lobsters sing of alienation and</p>
<p class="calibre1">obsolescence, of intelligence too slow and tenuous to support the</p>
<p class="calibre1">vicious pace of change that has sandblasted the human world until all</p>
<p class="calibre1">the edges people cling to are jagged and brittle.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beyond the distant lobsters, the cat pings an anonymous distributed</p>
<p class="calibre1">network server - peer-to-peer file storage spread holographically</p>
<p class="calibre1">across a million hosts, unerasable, full of secrets and lies that</p>
<p class="calibre1">nobody can afford to suppress. Rants, music, rip-offs of the latest</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bollywood hits: The cat spiders past them all, looking for the final</p>
<p class="calibre1">sample. Grabbing it - a momentary breakup in Manfred’s spectacles the</p>
<p class="calibre1">only symptom for either human to notice - the cat drags its prey home,</p>
<p class="calibre1">sucks it down, and compares it against the data sample Annette’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">exocortex is analysing.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry, my love. I just sometimes feel -” He sighs. “Age is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">process of closing off opportunities behind you. I’m not young enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">anymore - I’ve lost the dynamic optimism.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The data sample on the pirate server differs from the one Annette’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">implant is processing.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll get it back,” she reassures him quietly, stroking his side.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You are still sad from being mugged. This also will pass. You’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">see.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.” He finally relaxes, dropping back into the reflexive assurance</p>
<p class="calibre1">of his own will. “I’ll get over it, one way or another. Or someone who</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembers being me will …”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the darkness, Aineko bares teeth in a silent grin. Obeying a deeply</p>
<p class="calibre1">hardwired urge to meddle, he moves a file across, making a copy of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">alien download package Annette has been working on. She’s got a copy</p>
<p class="calibre1">of number two, the sequence the deep-space tracking network received</p>
<p class="calibre1">from close to home, which ESA and the other big combines have been</p>
<p class="calibre1">keeping to themselves. Another deeply buried thread starts up, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko analyses the package from a perspective no human being has yet</p>
<p class="calibre1">established. Presently a braid of processes running on an abstract</p>
<p class="calibre1">virtual machine asks him a question that cannot be encoded in any</p>
<p class="calibre1">human grammar. Watch and wait, he replies to his passenger. They’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">figure out what we are sooner or later.</p>
