<h2 id="calibre_toc_15" class="calibre3">Chapter 8: Elector</h2><p class="calibre1">Half a year passes on Saturn - more than a decade on Earth - and a lot</p>
<p class="calibre1">of things have changed in that time. The great terraforming project is</p>
<p class="calibre1">nearly complete, the festival planet dressed for a jubilee that will</p>
<p class="calibre1">last almost twenty of its years - four presingularity lifetimes -</p>
<p class="calibre1">before the Demolition. The lily-pad habitats have proliferated,</p>
<p class="calibre1">joining edge to edge in continent-sized slabs, drifting in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Saturnine cloud tops: and the refugees have begun to move in.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s a market specializing in clothing and fashion accessories</p>
<p class="calibre1">about fifty kilometers away from the transplanted museum where</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan’s mother lives, at a transportation nexus between three</p>
<p class="calibre1">lily-pad habitats where tube trains intersect in a huge maglev</p>
<p class="calibre1">cloverleaf. The market is crowded with strange and spectacular</p>
<p class="calibre1">visuals, algorithms unfolding in faster-than-real time before the</p>
<p class="calibre1">candy-striped awnings of tents. Domed yurts belch aromatic smoke from</p>
<p class="calibre1">crude fireplaces - what is it about hairless primates and their</p>
<p class="calibre1">tendency toward pyromania? - around the feet of diamond-walled</p>
<p class="calibre1">groundscrapers that pace carefully across the smart roads of the city.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The crowds are variegated and wildly mixed, immigrants from every</p>
<p class="calibre1">continent shopping and haggling, and in a few cases, getting out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">their skulls on strange substances on the pavements in front of giant</p>
<p class="calibre1">snail-shelled shebeens and squat bunkers made of thin layers of</p>
<p class="calibre1">concrete sprayed over soap-bubble aerogel. There are no automobiles,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but a bewildering range of personal transport gadgets, from</p>
<p class="calibre1">gyrostabilized pogo sticks and segways to kettenkrads and</p>
<p class="calibre1">spiderpalanquins, jostle for space with pedestrians and animals.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two women stop outside what in a previous century might have been the</p>
<p class="calibre1">store window of a fashion boutique: The younger one (blonde, with her</p>
<p class="calibre1">hair bound up in elaborate cornrows, wearing black leggings and a long</p>
<p class="calibre1">black leather jacket over a camouflage T) points to an elaborately</p>
<p class="calibre1">retro dress. “Wouldn’t my bum look big in that?” she asks, doubtfully.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ma ch�rie, you have but to try it -” The other woman (tall, wearing a</p>
<p class="calibre1">pin-striped man’s business suit from a previous century) flicks a</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought at the window, and the mannequin morphs, sprouting the younger</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman’s head, aping her posture and expression.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I missed out on the authentic retail experience, you know? It still</p>
<p class="calibre1">feels weird to be back somewhere with shops. ‘S what comes of living</p>
<p class="calibre1">off libraries of public domain designs for too long.” Amber twists her</p>
<p class="calibre1">hips, experimenting. “You get out of the habit of foraging. I don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">know about this retro thing at all. The Victorian vote isn’t critical,</p>
<p class="calibre1">is it …” She trails off.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You are a twenty-first-century platform selling, to electors</p>
<p class="calibre1">resimulated and incarnated from the Gilded Age. And yes, a bustle your</p>
<p class="calibre1">derriere does enhance. But -” Annette looks thoughtful.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm.” Amber frowns, and the shop window dummy turns and waggles its</p>
<p class="calibre1">hips at her, sending tiers of skirts swishing across the floor. Her</p>
<p class="calibre1">frown deepens. “If we’re really going to go through with this election</p>
<p class="calibre1">shit, it’s not just the resimulant voters I need to convince but the</p>
<p class="calibre1">contemporaries, and that’s a matter of substance, not image. They’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">lived through too much media warfare. They’re immune to any semiotic</p>
<p class="calibre1">payload short of an active cognitive attack. If I send out partials to</p>
<p class="calibre1">canvass them that look as if I’m trying to push buttons -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“- They will listen to your message, and nothing you wear or say will</p>
<p class="calibre1">sway them. Don’t worry about them, ma ch�rie. The naive resimulated</p>
<p class="calibre1">are another matter, and perhaps might be swayed. This your first</p>
<p class="calibre1">venture into democracy is, in how many years? Your privacy, she is an</p>
<p class="calibre1">illusion now. The question is what image will you project? People will</p>
<p class="calibre1">listen to you only once you gain their attention. Also, the swing</p>
<p class="calibre1">voters you must reach, they are future-shocked, timid. Your platform</p>
<p class="calibre1">is radical. Should you not project a comfortably conservative image?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber pulls a face, an expression of mild distaste for the whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">populist program. “Yes, I suppose I must, if necessary. But on second</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughts, that” - Amber snaps her fingers, and the mannequin turns</p>
<p class="calibre1">around once more before morphing back into neutrality, aureoles</p>
<p class="calibre1">perfect puckered disks above the top of its bodice - “is just too</p>
<p class="calibre1">much.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She doesn’t need to merge in the opinions of several different</p>
<p class="calibre1">fractional personalities, fashion critics and psephologists both, to</p>
<p class="calibre1">figure out that adopting Victorian/Cretan fusion fashion - a</p>
<p class="calibre1">breast-and-ass fetishist’s fantasy - isn’t the way to sell herself as</p>
<p class="calibre1">a serious politician to the nineteenth-century postsingularity fringe.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not running for election as the mother of the nation, I’m running</p>
<p class="calibre1">because I figure we’ve got about a billion seconds, at most, to get</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of this rat trap of a gravity well before the Vile Offspring get</p>
<p class="calibre1">seriously medieval on our CPU cycles, and if we don’t convince them to</p>
<p class="calibre1">come with us, they’re doomed. Let’s look for something more practical</p>
<p class="calibre1">that we can overload with the right signifiers.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like your coronation robe?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber winces. “Touch�.” The Ring Imperium is dead, along with whatever</p>
<p class="calibre1">was left over from its early orbital legal framework, and Amber is</p>
<p class="calibre1">lucky to be alive as a private citizen in this cold new age at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">edge of the halo. “But that was just scenery setting. I didn’t fully</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand what I was doing, back then.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome to maturity and experience.” Annette smiles distantly at some</p>
<p class="calibre1">faint memory: “You don’t feel older, you just know what you’re doing</p>
<p class="calibre1">this time. I wonder, sometimes, what Manny would make of it if he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">here.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That birdbrain,” Amber says dismissively, stung by the idea that her</p>
<p class="calibre1">father might have something to contribute. She follows Annette past a</p>
<p class="calibre1">gaggle of mendicant street evangelists preaching some new religion and</p>
<p class="calibre1">in through the door of a real department store, one with actual human</p>
<p class="calibre1">sales staff and fitting rooms to cut the clothing to shape. “If I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">sending out fractional mes tailored for different demographics, isn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">it a bit self-defeating to go for a single image? I mean, we could</p>
<p class="calibre1">drill down and tailor a partial for each individual elector -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perhaps.” The door reforms behind them. “But you need a core</p>
<p class="calibre1">identity.” Annette looks around, hunting for eye contact with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sales consultant. “To start with a core design, a style, then to work</p>
<p class="calibre1">outward, tailoring you for your audience. And besides, there is</p>
<p class="calibre1">tonight’s - ah, bonjour!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello. How can we help you?” The two female and one male shop</p>
<p class="calibre1">assistants who appear from around the displays - cycling through a</p>
<p class="calibre1">history of the couture industry, catwalk models mixing and matching</p>
<p class="calibre1">centuries of fashion - are clearly chips off a common primary</p>
<p class="calibre1">personality, instances united by their enhanced sartorial obsession.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If they’re not actually a fashion borganism, they’re not far from it,</p>
<p class="calibre1">dressed head to foot in the highest quality Chanel and Armani</p>
<p class="calibre1">replicas, making a classical twentieth-century statement. This isn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">simply a shop, it’s a temple to a very peculiar art form, its staff</p>
<p class="calibre1">trained as guardians of the esoteric secrets of good taste.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mais oui. We are looking for a wardrobe for my niece here.” Annette</p>
<p class="calibre1">reaches through the manifold of fashion ideas mapped within the shop’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">location cache and flips a requirement spec one of her ghosts has just</p>
<p class="calibre1">completed at the lead assistant: “She is into politics going, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">question of her image is important.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We would be delighted to help you,” purrs the proprietor, taking a</p>
<p class="calibre1">delicate step forward: “Perhaps you could tell us what you’ve got in</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh. Well.” Amber takes a deep breath, glances sidelong at Annette;</p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette stares back, unblinking. It’s your head, she sends. “I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">involved in the accelerationista administrative program. Are you</p>
<p class="calibre1">familiar with it?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The head coutureborg frowns slightly, twin furrows rippling her brow</p>
<p class="calibre1">between perfectly symmetrical eyebrows, plucked to match her classic</p>
<p class="calibre1">New Look suit. “I have heard reference to it, but a lady of fashion</p>
<p class="calibre1">like myself does not concern herself with politics,” she says, a touch</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-deprecatingly. “Especially the politics of her clients. Your, ah,</p>
<p class="calibre1">aunt said it was a question of image?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” Amber shrugs, momentarily self-conscious about her casual rags.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s my election agent. My problem, as she says, is there’s a</p>
<p class="calibre1">certain voter demographic that mistakes image for substance and is</p>
<p class="calibre1">afraid of the unknown, and I need to acquire a wardrobe that triggers</p>
<p class="calibre1">associations of probity, of respect and deliberation. One suitable for</p>
<p class="calibre1">a representative with a radical political agenda but a strong track</p>
<p class="calibre1">record. I’m afraid I’m in a hurry to start with - I’ve got a big</p>
<p class="calibre1">fund-raising party tonight. I know it’s short notice, but I need</p>
<p class="calibre1">something off the shelf for it.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What exactly is it you’re hoping to achieve?” asks the male</p>
<p class="calibre1">couturier, his voice hoarse and his r’s rolling with some half-shed</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mediterranean accent. He sounds fascinated. “If you think it might</p>
<p class="calibre1">influence your choice of wardrobe …”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m running for the assembly,” Amber says bluntly. “On a platform</p>
<p class="calibre1">calling for a state of emergency and an immediate total effort to</p>
<p class="calibre1">assemble a starship. This solar system isn’t going to be habitable for</p>
<p class="calibre1">much longer, and we need to emigrate. All of us, you included, before</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Vile Offspring decide to reprocess us into computronium. I’m going</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be doorstepping the entire electorate in parallel, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">experience needs to be personalized.” She manages to smile. “That</p>
<p class="calibre1">means, I think, perhaps eight outfits and four different independent</p>
<p class="calibre1">variables for each, accessories, and two or three hats - enough that</p>
<p class="calibre1">each is seen by no more than a few thousand voters. Both physical</p>
<p class="calibre1">fabric and virtual. In addition, I’ll want to see your range of</p>
<p class="calibre1">historical formalwear, but that’s of secondary interest for now.” She</p>
<p class="calibre1">grins. “Do you have any facilities for response-testing the</p>
<p class="calibre1">combinations against different personality types from different</p>
<p class="calibre1">periods? If we could run up some models, that would be useful.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think we can do better than that.” The manager nods approvingly,</p>
<p class="calibre1">perhaps contemplating her gold-backed deposit account. “Hansel, please</p>
<p class="calibre1">divert any further visitors until we have dealt with Madam …?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Macx. Amber Macx.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“- Macx’s requirements.” She shows no sign of familiarity with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">name. Amber winces slightly; it’s a sign of how hugely fractured the</p>
<p class="calibre1">children of Saturn have become, and of how vast the population of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">halo, that only a generation has passed and already barely anyone</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembers the Queen of the Ring Imperium. “If you’d come this way,</p>
<p class="calibre1">please, we can begin to research an eigenstyle combination that</p>
<p class="calibre1">matches your requirements -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan walks, shrouded in isolation, through the crowds gathered for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the festival. The only people who see him are the chattering ghosts of</p>
<p class="calibre1">dead politicians and writers, deported from the inner system by order</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the Vile Offspring. The green and pleasant plain stretches toward a</p>
<p class="calibre1">horizon a thousand kilometers away, beneath a lemon-yellow sky. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">air smells faintly of ammonia, and the big spaces are full of small</p>
<p class="calibre1">ideas; but Sirhan doesn’t care because, for now, he’s alone.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Except that he isn’t, really.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse me, are you real?” someone asks him in American-accented</p>
<p class="calibre1">English.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">It takes a moment or two for Sirhan to disengage from his</p>
<p class="calibre1">introspection and realize that he’s being spoken to. “What?” he asks,</p>
<p class="calibre1">slightly puzzled. Wiry and pale, Sirhan wears the robes of a Berber</p>
<p class="calibre1">goatherd on his body and the numinous halo of a utility fogbank above</p>
<p class="calibre1">his head: In his abstraction, he vaguely resembles a saintly shepherd</p>
<p class="calibre1">in a postsingularity nativity play. “I say, what?” Outrage simmers at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the back of his mind - Is nowhere private? - but as he turns, he sees</p>
<p class="calibre1">that one of the ghost pods has split lengthwise across its white</p>
<p class="calibre1">mushroomlike crown, spilling a trickle of leftover construction fluid</p>
<p class="calibre1">and a completely hairless, slightly bemused-looking Anglo male who</p>
<p class="calibre1">wears an expression of profound surprise.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t find my implants,” the Anglo male says, shaking his head.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I’m really here, aren’t I? Incarnate?” He glances round at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">other pods. “This isn’t a sim.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan sighs - another exile - and sends forth a daemon to interrogate</p>
<p class="calibre1">the ghost pod’s abstract interface. It doesn’t tell him much - unlike</p>
<p class="calibre1">most of the resurrectees, this one seems to be undocumented. “You’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">been dead. Now you’re alive. I suppose that means you’re now almost as</p>
<p class="calibre1">real as I am. What else do you need to know?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When is -” The newcomer stops. “Can you direct me to the processing</p>
<p class="calibre1">center?” he asks carefully. “I’m disoriented.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan is surprised - most immigrants take a lot longer to figure that</p>
<p class="calibre1">out. “Did you die recently?” he asks.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not sure I died at all.” The newcomer rubs his bald head, looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">puzzled. “Hey, no jacks!” He shrugs, exasperated. “Look, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">processing center ..?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Over there.” Sirhan gestures at the monumental mass of the Boston</p>
<p class="calibre1">Museum of Science (shipped all the way from Earth a couple of decades</p>
<p class="calibre1">ago to save it from the demolition of the inner system). “My mother</p>
<p class="calibre1">runs it.” He smiles thinly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your mother -” the newly resurrected immigrant stares at him</p>
<p class="calibre1">intensely, then blinks. “Holy shit.” He takes a step toward Sirhan.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It is you -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan recoils and snaps his fingers. The thin trail of vaporous cloud</p>
<p class="calibre1">that has been following him all this time, shielding his shaven pate</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the diffuse red glow of the swarming shells of orbital</p>
<p class="calibre1">nanocomputers that have replaced the inner planets, extrudes a staff</p>
<p class="calibre1">of hazy blue mist that stretches down from the air and slams together</p>
<p class="calibre1">in his hand like a quarterstaff spun from bubbles. “Are you</p>
<p class="calibre1">threatening me, sir?” he asks, deceptively mildly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I -” The newcomer stops dead. Then he throws back his head and</p>
<p class="calibre1">laughs. “Don’t be silly, son. We’re related!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Son?” Sirhan bristles. “Who do you think you are -” A horrible</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought occurs to him. “Oh. Oh dear.” A wash of adrenaline drenches</p>
<p class="calibre1">him in warm sweat. “I do believe we’ve met, in a manner of speaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">…” Oh boy, this is going to upset so many applecarts, he realizes,</p>
<p class="calibre1">spinning off a ghost to think about the matter. The implications are</p>
<p class="calibre1">enormous.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The naked newcomer nods, grinning at some private joke. “You look</p>
<p class="calibre1">different from ground level. And now I’m human again.” He runs his</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands down his ribs, pauses, and glances at Sirhan owlishly. “Um. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t mean to frighten you. But I don’t suppose you could find your</p>
<p class="calibre1">aged grandfather something to wear?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan sighs and points his staff straight up at the sky. The rings</p>
<p class="calibre1">are edge on, for the lily pad continent floats above an ocean of cold</p>
<p class="calibre1">gas along Saturn’s equator, and they glitter like a ruby laser beam</p>
<p class="calibre1">slashed across the sky. “Let there be aerogel.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">A cloud of wispy soap bubble congeals in a cone shape above the newly</p>
<p class="calibre1">resurrected ancient and drops over him, forming a caftan. “Thanks,” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">says. He looks round, twisting his neck, then winces. “Damn, that</p>
<p class="calibre1">hurt. Ouch. I need to get myself a set of implants.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They can sort you out in the processing center. It’s in the basement</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the west wing. They’ll give you something more permanent to wear,</p>
<p class="calibre1">too.” Sirhan peers at him. “Your face -” He pages through rarely used</p>
<p class="calibre1">memories. Yes, it’s Manfred as he looked in the early years of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">last century. As he looked around the time Mother-not was born.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s something positively indecent about meeting your own</p>
<p class="calibre1">grandfather in the full flush of his youth. “Are you sure you haven’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">been messing with your phenotype?” he asks suspiciously.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, this is what I used to look like. I think. Back in the naked ape</p>
<p class="calibre1">again, after all these years as an emergent function of a flock of</p>
<p class="calibre1">passenger pigeons.” His grandfather smirks. “What’s your mother going</p>
<p class="calibre1">to say?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I really don’t know -” Sirhan shakes his head. “Come on, let’s get</p>
<p class="calibre1">you to immigrant processing. You’re sure you’re not just an historical</p>
<p class="calibre1">simulation?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The place is already heaving with the resimulated. Just why the Vile</p>
<p class="calibre1">Offspring seem to feel it’s necessary to apply valuable exaquops to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the job of deriving accurate simulations of dead humans - outrageously</p>
<p class="calibre1">accurate simulations of long-dead lives, annealed until their written</p>
<p class="calibre1">corpus matches that inherited from the presingularity era in the form</p>
<p class="calibre1">of chicken scratchings on mashed tree pulp - much less beaming them at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the refugee camps on Saturn - is beyond Sirhan’s ken: But he wishes</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’d stop.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just a couple of days ago I crapped on your lawn. Hope you don’t</p>

<p class="calibre1">If you are remembering this presentation, you are probably</p>
<p class="calibre1">resimulated. This is not the same as being resurrected. You may</p>
<p class="calibre1">remember dying. Do not worry: Like all your other memories, it is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fabrication. In fact, this is the first time you have ever been alive.</p>

<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The center of the solar system - Mercury, Venus, Earth’s Moon, Mars,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the asteroid belt, and Jupiter - have been dismantled, or are being</p>
<p class="calibre1">dismantled, by weakly godlike intelligences. [NB: Monotheistic clergy</p>
<p class="calibre1">and Europeans who remember living prior to 1600, see alternative</p>
<p class="calibre1">memeplex “in the beginning.”] A weakly godlike intelligence is not a</p>
<p class="calibre1">supernatural agency, but the product of a highly advanced society that</p>
<p class="calibre1">learned how to artificially create souls [late 20th century: software]</p>
<p class="calibre1">and translate human minds into souls and vice versa. [Core concepts:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Human beings all have souls. Souls are software objects. Software is</p>
<p class="calibre1">not immortal.]</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of the weakly godlike intelligences appear to cultivate an</p>
<p class="calibre1">interest in their human antecedents - for whatever reason is not</p>
<p class="calibre1">known. (Possibilities include the study of history through</p>
<p class="calibre1">horticulture, entertainment through live-action role-playing, revenge,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and economic forgery.) While no definitive analysis is possible, all</p>
<p class="calibre1">the resimulated persons to date exhibit certain common</p>
<p class="calibre1">characteristics: They are all based on well-documented historical</p>
<p class="calibre1">persons, their memories show suspicious gaps [see: smoke and mirrors],</p>
<p class="calibre1">and they are ignorant of or predate the singularity [see: Turing</p>
<p class="calibre1">Oracle, Vinge catastrophe].</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is believed that the weakly godlike agencies have created you as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">vehicle for the introspective study of your historical antecedent by</p>
<p class="calibre1">backward-chaining from your corpus of documented works, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">back-projected genome derived from your collateral descendants, to</p>
<p class="calibre1">generate an abstract description of your computational state vector.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This technique is extremely intensive [see: expTime-complete</p>
<p class="calibre1">algorithms, Turing Oracle, time travel, industrial magic] but</p>
<p class="calibre1">marginally plausible in the absence of supernatural explanations.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">After experiencing your life, the weakly godlike agencies have</p>
<p class="calibre1">expelled you. For reasons unknown, they chose to do this by</p>
<p class="calibre1">transmitting your upload state and genome/proteome complex to</p>
<p class="calibre1">receivers owned and operated by a consortium of charities based on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Saturn. These charities have provided for your basic needs, including</p>
<p class="calibre1">the body you now occupy.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">In summary: You are a reconstruction of someone who lived and died a</p>
<p class="calibre1">long time ago, not a reincarnation. You have no intrinsic moral right</p>
<p class="calibre1">to the identity you believe to be your own, and an extensive body of</p>
<p class="calibre1">case law states that you do not inherit your antecedent’s possessions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Other than that, you are a free individual.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Note that fictional resimulation is strictly forbidden. If you have</p>
<p class="calibre1">reason to believe that you may be a fictional character, you must</p>
<p class="calibre1">contact the city immediately. [ See: James Bond, Spider Jerusalem.]</p>
<p class="calibre1">Failure to comply is a felony.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where you are:</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">You are on Saturn. Saturn is a gas giant planet 120,500 kilometers in</p>
<p class="calibre1">diameter, located 1.5 billion kilometers from Earth’s sun. [NB:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Europeans who remember living prior to 1580, see alternative memeplex</p>
<p class="calibre1">“the flat Earth - not”.] Saturn has been partially terraformed by</p>
<p class="calibre1">posthuman emigrants from Earth and Jupiter orbit: The ground beneath</p>
<p class="calibre1">your feet is, in reality, the floor of a hydrogen balloon the size of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a continent, floating in Saturn’s upper atmosphere. [NB: Europeans who</p>
<p class="calibre1">remember living prior to 1790, internalize the supplementary memeplex:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“the Brothers Montgolfier.”] The balloon is very safe, but mining</p>
<p class="calibre1">activities and the use of ballistic weapons are strongly deprecated</p>
<p class="calibre1">because the air outside is unbreathable and extremely cold.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The society you have been instantiated in is extremely wealthy within</p>
<p class="calibre1">the scope of Economics 1.0, the value transfer system developed by</p>
<p class="calibre1">human beings during and after your own time. Money exists, and is used</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the usual range of goods and services, but the basics - food,</p>
<p class="calibre1">water, air, power, off-the-shelf clothing, housing, historical</p>
<p class="calibre1">entertainment, and monster trucks - are free. An implicit social</p>
<p class="calibre1">contract dictates that, in return for access to these facilities, you</p>
<p class="calibre1">obey certain laws.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you wish to opt out of this social contract, be advised that other</p>
<p class="calibre1">worlds may run Economics 2.0 or subsequent releases. These</p>
<p class="calibre1">value-transfer systems are more efficient - hence wealthier - than</p>
<p class="calibre1">Economics 1.0, but true participation in Economics 2.0 is not possible</p>
<p class="calibre1">without dehumanizing cognitive surgery. Thus, in absolute terms,</p>
<p class="calibre1">although this society is richer than any you have ever heard of, it is</p>
<p class="calibre1">also a poverty-stricken backwater compared to its neighbors.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Things you should avoid doing:</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many activities that have been classified as crimes in other societies</p>
<p class="calibre1">are legal here. These include but are not limited to: acts of worship,</p>
<p class="calibre1">art, sex, violence, communication, or commerce between consenting</p>
<p class="calibre1">competent sapients of any species, except where such acts transgress</p>
<p class="calibre1">the list of prohibitions below. [See additional memeplex: competence</p>
<p class="calibre1">defined.]</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some activities are prohibited here and may have been legal in your</p>
<p class="calibre1">previous experience. These include willful deprivation of ability to</p>
<p class="calibre1">consent [see: slavery], interference in the absence of consent [see:</p>
<p class="calibre1">minors, legal status of], formation of limited liability companies</p>
<p class="calibre1">[see: singularity], and invasion of defended privacy [see: the Slug,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cognitive Pyramid Schemes, Brain Hacking, Thompson Trust Exploit].</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some activities unfamiliar to you are highly illegal and should be</p>
<p class="calibre1">scrupulously avoided. These include: possession of nuclear weapons,</p>
<p class="calibre1">possession of unlimited autonomous replicators [see: gray goo],</p>
<p class="calibre1">coercive assimilationism [see: borganism, aggressive], coercive</p>
<p class="calibre1">halting of Turing-equivalent personalities [see: basilisks], and</p>
<p class="calibre1">applied theological engineering [see: God bothering].</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some activities superficially familiar to you are merely stupid and</p>
<p class="calibre1">should be avoided for your safety, although they are not illegal as</p>
<p class="calibre1">such. These include: giving your bank account details to the son of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Nigerian Minister of Finance; buying title to bridges,</p>
<p class="calibre1">skyscrapers, spacecraft, planets, or other real assets; murder;</p>
<p class="calibre1">selling your identity; and entering into financial contracts with</p>
<p class="calibre1">entities running Economics 2.0 or higher.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Things you should do as soon as possible:</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many material artifacts you may consider essential to life are freely</p>
<p class="calibre1">available - just ask the city, and it will grow you clothes, a house,</p>
<p class="calibre1">food, or other basic essentials. Note, however, that the library of</p>
<p class="calibre1">public domain structure templates is of necessity restrictive, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">does not contain items that are highly fashionable or that remain in</p>
<p class="calibre1">copyright. Nor will the city provide you with replicators, weapons,</p>
<p class="calibre1">sexual favors, slaves, or zombies.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">You are advised to register as a citizen as soon as possible. If the</p>
<p class="calibre1">individual you are a resimulation of can be confirmed dead, you may</p>
<p class="calibre1">adopt their name but not - in law - any lien or claim on their</p>
<p class="calibre1">property, contracts, or descendants. You register as a citizen by</p>
<p class="calibre1">asking the city to register you; the process is painless and typically</p>
<p class="calibre1">complete within four hours. Unless you are registered, your legal</p>
<p class="calibre1">status as a sapient organism may be challenged. The ability to request</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizenship rights is one of the legal tests for sapience, and failure</p>
<p class="calibre1">to comply may place you in legal jeopardy. You can renounce your</p>
<p class="calibre1">citizenship whenever you wish: This may be desirable if you emigrate</p>
<p class="calibre1">to another polity.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">While many things are free, it is highly likely that you posses no</p>
<p class="calibre1">employable skills, and therefore, no way of earning money with which</p>
<p class="calibre1">to purchase unfree items. The pace of change in the past century has</p>
<p class="calibre1">rendered almost all skills you may have learned obsolete [see:</p>
<p class="calibre1">singularity]. However, owing to the rapid pace of change, many</p>
<p class="calibre1">cooperatives, trusts, and guilds offer on-the-job training or</p>
<p class="calibre1">educational loans.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your ability to learn depends on your ability to take information in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the format in which it is offered. Implants are frequently used to</p>
<p class="calibre1">provide a direct link between your brain and the intelligent machines</p>
<p class="calibre1">that surround it. A basic core implant set is available on request</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the city. [See: implant security, firewall, wetware.]</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your health is probably good if you have just been reinstantiated, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">is likely to remain good for some time. Most diseases are curable, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">in event of an incurable ailment or injury, a new body may be provided</p>
<p class="calibre1">- for a fee. (In event of your murder, you will be furnished with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">new body at the expense of your killer.) If you have any preexisting</p>
<p class="calibre1">medical conditions or handicaps, consult the city.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The city is an agoric-annealing participatory democracy with a limited</p>
<p class="calibre1">liability constitution. Its current executive agency is a weakly</p>
<p class="calibre1">godlike intelligence that chooses to associate with human-equivalent</p>
<p class="calibre1">intelligences: This agency is colloquially known as “Hello Kitty,”</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Beautiful Cat,” or “Aineko,” and may manifest itself in a variety of</p>
<p class="calibre1">physical avatars if corporeal interaction is desired. (Prior to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrival of “Hello Kitty,” the city used a variety of human-designed</p>
<p class="calibre1">expert systems that provided suboptimal performance.)</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The city’s mission statement is to provide a mediatory environment for</p>
<p class="calibre1">human-equivalent intelligences and to preserve same in the face of</p>
<p class="calibre1">external aggression. Citizens are encouraged to participate in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ongoing political processes of determining such responses. Citizens</p>
<p class="calibre1">also have a duty to serve on a jury if called (including senatorial</p>
<p class="calibre1">service), and to defend the city.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where to go for further information:</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Until you have registered as a citizen and obtained basic implants,</p>
<p class="calibre1">all further questions should be directed to the city. Once you have</p>
<p class="calibre1">learned to use your implants, you will not need to ask this question.</p>

<p class="calibre1">Welcome to decade the ninth, singularity plus one gigasecond (or</p>
<p class="calibre1">maybe more - nobody’s quite sure when, or indeed if, a singularity</p>

<p class="calibre1">either six billion, or sixty billion, depending on whether you</p>

<p class="calibre1">together by quantum entanglement into a web so dense that each gram</p>
<p class="calibre1">of matter can simulate all the possible life experiences of an</p>
<p class="calibre1">individual human being in a scant handful of minutes. Economics 2.0</p>

<p class="calibre1">The latest generation of posthuman entities is less overtly hostile</p>

<p class="calibre1">surges, racing up the sixty-meter shaft toward the observation deck at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the top of the Atomium. It’s a ten-meter-diameter metal globe, spiral</p>
<p class="calibre1">staircases and escalators connecting it to the seven spheres at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">corners of an octahedron that make up the former centerpiece of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">1950 World’s Fair. Unlike most of the rest of Brussels, it’s the</p>
<p class="calibre1">original bits and atoms, bent alloy structures from before the space</p>
<p class="calibre1">age shipped out to Saturn at enormous expense. The lift arrives with a</p>
<p class="calibre1">slight jerk. “Excuse me,” squeaks one of the good-time girls as she</p>
<p class="calibre1">lurches backward, elbowing Sirhan.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He blinks, barely noticing her black bob of hair, chromatophore-tinted</p>
<p class="calibre1">shadows artfully tuned around her eyes: “Nothing to excuse.” In the</p>
<p class="calibre1">background, Aineko is droning on sarcastically about the lack of</p>
<p class="calibre1">interest the crew of the Field Circus exhibited in the cat’s effort to</p>
<p class="calibre1">decompile their hitchhiker, the Slug. It’s distracting as hell, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan feels a desperate urge to understand what happened out there.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s the key to understanding his not-mother’s obsessions and</p>
<p class="calibre1">weaknesses - which, he senses, will be important in the times to come.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He evades the gaggle of overdressed good-time girls and steps out onto</p>
<p class="calibre1">the lower of the two stainless-steel decks that bisect the sphere.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Accepting a fruit cocktail from a discreetly humaniform waitron, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">strolls toward a row of triangular windows that gaze out across the</p>
<p class="calibre1">arena toward the American Pavilion and the World Village. The metal</p>
<p class="calibre1">walls are braced with turquoise-painted girders, and the perspex</p>
<p class="calibre1">transparencies are fogged with age. He can barely see the</p>
<p class="calibre1">one-tenth-scale model of an atomic-powered ocean liner leaving the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pier below, or the eight-engined giant seaplane beside it. “They never</p>
<p class="calibre1">once asked me if the Slug had attempted to map itself into the</p>
<p class="calibre1">human-compatible spaces aboard the ship,” Aineko bitches at him. “I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t expecting them to, but really! Your mother’s too trusting,</p>
<p class="calibre1">boy.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I suppose you took precautions?” Sirhan’s ghost murmurs to the cat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That sets the irascible metafeline off again on a long discursive</p>
<p class="calibre1">tail-washing rant about the unreliability of Economics-2.0-compliant</p>
<p class="calibre1">financial instruments. Economics 2.0 apparently replaces the</p>
<p class="calibre1">single-indirection layer of conventional money, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">multiple-indirection mappings of options trades, with some kind of</p>
<p class="calibre1">insanely baroque object-relational framework based on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">parameterized desires and subjective experiential values of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">players, and as far as the cat is concerned, this makes all such</p>
<p class="calibre1">transactions intrinsically untrustworthy.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Which is why you’re stuck here with us apes, Sirhan-prime cynically</p>
<p class="calibre1">notes as he spawns an Eliza ghost to carry on nodding at the cat while</p>
<p class="calibre1">he experiences the party.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s uncomfortably warm in the Atomium sphere - not surprising, there</p>
<p class="calibre1">must be thirty people milling around up here, not counting the</p>
<p class="calibre1">waitrons - and several local multicast channels are playing a variety</p>
<p class="calibre1">of styles of music to synchronize the mood swings of the revelers to</p>
<p class="calibre1">hardcore techno, waltz, raga …</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Having a good time, are we?” Sirhan breaks away from integrating one</p>
<p class="calibre1">of his timid philosophers and realizes that his glass is empty, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">his mother is grinning alarmingly at him over the rim of a cocktail</p>
<p class="calibre1">glass containing something that glows in the dark. She’s wearing</p>
<p class="calibre1">spike-heeled boots and a black velvet cat suit that hugs her contours</p>
<p class="calibre1">like a second skin, and she’s already getting drunk. In wall-clock</p>
<p class="calibre1">years she is younger than Sirhan; it’s like having a bizarrely knowing</p>
<p class="calibre1">younger sister mysteriously injected into his life to replace the</p>
<p class="calibre1">eigenmother who stayed home and died with the Ring Imperium decades</p>
<p class="calibre1">ago. “Look at you, hiding in a corner at your grandfather’s party!</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hey, your glass is empty. Want to try this caipirinha? There’s someone</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’ve got to meet over here -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s at moments like this that Sirhan really wonders what in Jupiter’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">orbit his father ever saw in this woman. (But then again, in the world</p>
<p class="calibre1">line this instance of her has returned from, he didn’t. So what does</p>
<p class="calibre1">that signify?) “As long as there’s no fermented grape juice in it,” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">says resignedly, allowing himself to be led past a gaggle of</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversations and a mournful-looking gorilla slurping a long drink</p>
<p class="calibre1">through a straw. “More of your accelerationista allies?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe not.” It’s the girl gang he avoided noticing in the lift, their</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes sparkling, really getting into this early twen-cen drag party</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing, waving their cigarette holders and cocktail glasses around with</p>
<p class="calibre1">wild abandon. “Rita, I’d like you to meet Sirhan, my other fork’s son.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan, this is Rita? She’s an historian, too. Why don’t you -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dark eyes, emphasized not by powder or paint, but by chromatophores</p>
<p class="calibre1">inside her skin cells: black hair, chain of enormous pearls, slim</p>
<p class="calibre1">black dress sweeping the floor, a look of mild embarrassment on her</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart-shaped face: She could be a clone of Audrey Hepburn in any other</p>
<p class="calibre1">century, “Didn’t I just meet you in the elevator?” The embarrassment</p>
<p class="calibre1">shifts to her cheeks, becoming visible.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan flushes, unsure how to reply. Just then, an interloper arrives</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the scene, pushing in between them. “Are you the curator who</p>
<p class="calibre1">reorganized the Precambrian gallery along teleology lines? I’ve got</p>
<p class="calibre1">some things to say about that!” The interloper is tall, assertive, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">blonde. Sirhan hates her from the first sight of her wagging finger.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh shut up, Marissa, this is a party, you’ve been being a pain all</p>
<p class="calibre1">evening.” To his surprise, Rita the historian rounds on the interloper</p>
<p class="calibre1">angrily.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not a problem,” he manages to say. In the back of his mind,</p>
<p class="calibre1">something makes the Rogerian puppet-him that’s listening to the cat</p>
<p class="calibre1">sit up and dump-merge a whole lump of fresh memories into his mind -</p>
<p class="calibre1">something important, something about the Vile Offspring sending a</p>
<p class="calibre1">starship to bring something back from the router - but the people</p>
<p class="calibre1">around him are soaking up so much attention that he has to file it for</p>
<p class="calibre1">later.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes it is a problem,” Rita declares. She points at the interloper,</p>
<p class="calibre1">who is saying something about the invalidity of teleological</p>
<p class="calibre1">interpretations, trying to justify herself, and says, “Plonk. Phew.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Where were we?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan blinks. Suddenly everyone but him seems to be ignoring that</p>
<p class="calibre1">annoying Marissa person. “What just happened?” he asks cautiously.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I killfiled her. Don’t tell me, you aren’t running Superplonk yet,</p>
<p class="calibre1">are you?” Rita flicks a location-cached idea at him and he takes it</p>
<p class="calibre1">cautiously, spawning a couple of specialized Turing Oracles to check</p>
<p class="calibre1">it for halting states. It seems to be some kind of optic lobe hack</p>
<p class="calibre1">that accesses a collaborative database of eigenfaces, with some sort</p>
<p class="calibre1">of side interface to Broca’s region. “Share and enjoy,</p>
<p class="calibre1">confrontation-free parties.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve never seen -” Sirhan trails off as he loads the module</p>
<p class="calibre1">distractedly. (The cat is rambling on about god modules and metastatic</p>
<p class="calibre1">entanglement and the difficulty of arranging to have personalities</p>
<p class="calibre1">custom-grown to order somewhere in the back of his head, while his</p>
<p class="calibre1">fractional-self nods wisely whenever it pauses.) Something like an</p>
<p class="calibre1">inner eyelid descends. He looks round; there’s a vague blob at one</p>
<p class="calibre1">side of the room, making an annoying buzzing sound. His mother seems</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be having an animated conversation with it. “That’s rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">interesting.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, it helps no end at this sort of event.” Rita startles him by</p>
<p class="calibre1">taking his left arm in hand - her cigarette holder shrivels and</p>
<p class="calibre1">condenses until it’s no more than a slight thickening around the wrist</p>
<p class="calibre1">of her opera glove - and steers him toward a waitron. “I’m sorry about</p>
<p class="calibre1">your foot, earlier, I was a bit overloaded. Is Amber Macx really your</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not exactly, she’s my eigenmother,” he mumbles. “The reincarnated</p>
<p class="calibre1">download of the version who went out to Hyundai +4904/[-56] aboard the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Field Circus. She married a French-Algerian confidence-trick analyst</p>
<p class="calibre1">instead of my father, but I think they divorced a couple of years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre1">My real mother married an imam, but they died in the aftermath of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Economics 2.0.” She seems to be steering him in the direction of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">window bay Amber dragged him away from earlier. “Why do you ask?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because you’re not very good at making small talk,” Rita says</p>
<p class="calibre1">quietly, “and you don’t seem very good in crowds. Is that right? Was</p>
<p class="calibre1">it you who performed that amazing dissection of Wittgenstein’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">cognitive map? The one with the preverbal G�del string in it?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was -” He clears his throat. “You thought it was amazing?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly, on impulse, he detaches a ghost to identify this Rita person</p>
<p class="calibre1">and find out who she is, what she wants. It’s not normally worth the</p>
<p class="calibre1">effort to get to know someone more closely than casual small talk, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">she seems to have been digging into his background, and he wants to</p>
<p class="calibre1">know why. Along with the him that’s chatting to Aineko, that makes</p>
<p class="calibre1">about three instances pulling in near-realtime resources. He’ll be</p>
<p class="calibre1">running up an existential debt soon if he keeps forking ghosts like</p>
<p class="calibre1">this.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought so,” she says. There’s a bench in front of the wall, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">somehow he finds himself sitting on it next to her. There’s no danger,</p>
<p class="calibre1">we’re not in private or anything, he tells himself stiffly. She’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">smiling at him, face tilted slightly to one side and lips parted, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">for a moment, a dizzy sense of possibility washes over him: What if</p>
<p class="calibre1">she’s about to throw all propriety aside? How undignified! Sirhan</p>
<p class="calibre1">believes in self-restraint and dignity. “I was really interested in</p>
<p class="calibre1">this -” She passes him another dynamically loadable blob, encompassing</p>
<p class="calibre1">a detailed critique of his analysis of Wittgenstein’s matriophobia in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the context of gendered language constructs and nineteenth century</p>
<p class="calibre1">Viennese society, along with a hypothesis that leaves Sirhan gasping</p>
<p class="calibre1">with mild indignation at the very idea that he of all people might</p>
<p class="calibre1">share Wittgenstein’s skewed outlook - “What do you think?” she asks,</p>
<p class="calibre1">grinning impishly at him.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nnngk.” Sirhan tries to unswallow his tongue. Rita crosses her legs,</p>
<p class="calibre1">her gown hissing. “I, ah, that is to say” - At which moment, his</p>
<p class="calibre1">partials reintegrate, dumping a slew of positively pornographic</p>
<p class="calibre1">images into his memories. It’s a trap! they shriek, her breasts and</p>
<p class="calibre1">hips and pubes - clean-shaven, he can’t help noticing - thrusting at</p>
<p class="calibre1">him in hotly passionate abandon, Mother’s trying to make you loose</p>
<p class="calibre1">like her! and he remembers what it would be like to wake up in bed</p>
<p class="calibre1">next to this woman whom he barely knows after being married to her for</p>
<p class="calibre1">a year, because one of his cognitive ghosts has just spent several</p>
<p class="calibre1">seconds of network time (or several subjective months) getting hot and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sweaty with a ghost of her own, and she does have interesting research</p>
<p class="calibre1">ideas, even if she’s a pushy over-westernized woman who thinks she can</p>
<p class="calibre1">run his life for him. “What is this?” he splutters, his ears growing</p>
<p class="calibre1">hot and his garments constricting.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just speculating about possibilities. We could get a lot done</p>
<p class="calibre1">together.” She snakes an arm round his shoulders and pulls him toward</p>
<p class="calibre1">her, gently. “Don’t you want to find out if we could work out?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But, but -” Sirhan is steaming. Is she offering casual sex? He</p>
<p class="calibre1">wonders, profoundly embarrassed by his own inability to read her</p>
<p class="calibre1">signals: “What do you want?” he asks.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You do know that you can do more with Superplonk than just killfile</p>
<p class="calibre1">annoying idiots?” she whispers in his ear. “We can be invisible right</p>
<p class="calibre1">now, if you like. It’s great for confidential meetings - other things,</p>
<p class="calibre1">too. We can work beautifully together, our ghosts annealed really well</p>
<p class="calibre1">…”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan jumps up, his face stinging, and turns away: “No thank you!” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">snaps, angry at himself. “Goodbye!” His other instances, interrupted</p>
<p class="calibre1">by his broadcast emotional overload, are distracted from their tasks</p>
<p class="calibre1">and sputtering with indignation. Her hurt expression is too much for</p>
<p class="calibre1">him: The killfile snaps down, blurring her into an indistinct black</p>
<p class="calibre1">blob on the wall, veiled by his own brain as he turns and walks away,</p>
<p class="calibre1">seething with anger at his mother for being so unfair as to make him</p>
<p class="calibre1">behold his own face in the throes of fleshy passion.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile, in one of the lower spheres, padded with silvery blue</p>
<p class="calibre1">insulating pillows bound together with duct tape, the movers and</p>
<p class="calibre1">shakers of the accelerationista faction are discussing their bid for</p>
<p class="calibre1">world power at fractional-C velocities.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We can’t outrun everything. For example, a collapse of the false</p>
<p class="calibre1">vacuum,” Manfred insists, slightly uncoordinated and slurring his</p>
<p class="calibre1">vowels under the influence of the first glass of fruit punch he’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">experienced in nigh-on twenty realtime years. His body is young and</p>
<p class="calibre1">still relatively featureless, hair still growing out, and he’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">abandoned his old no-implants fetish at last to adopt an array of</p>
<p class="calibre1">interfaces that let him internalize all the exocortex processes that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he formerly ran on an array of dumb Turing machines outside his body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s standing on his own sense of style and is the only person in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">room who isn’t wearing some variation of dinner jacket or classical</p>
<p class="calibre1">evening dress. “Entangled exchange via routers is all very well, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">it won’t let us escape the universe itself - any phase change will</p>
<p class="calibre1">catch up eventually, the network must have an end. And then where will</p>
<p class="calibre1">we be, Sameena?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not disputing that.” The woman he’s talking to, wearing a</p>
<p class="calibre1">green-and-gold sari and a medieval maharajah’s ransom in gold and</p>
<p class="calibre1">natural diamonds, nods thoughtfully. “But it hasn’t happened yet, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">we’ve got evidence that superhuman intelligences have been loose in</p>
<p class="calibre1">this universe for gigayears, so there’s a fair bet that the worst</p>
<p class="calibre1">catastrophe scenarios are unlikely. And looking closer to home, we</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t know what the routers are for, or who made them. Until then …”</p>
<p class="calibre1">She shrugs. “Look what happened last time somebody tried to probe</p>
<p class="calibre1">them. No offense intended.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s already happened. If what I hear is correct, the Vile Offspring</p>
<p class="calibre1">aren’t nearly as negative about the idea of using the routers as we</p>
<p class="calibre1">old-fashioned metahumans might like to believe.” Manfred frowns,</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying to recall some hazy anecdote - he’s experimenting with a new</p>
<p class="calibre1">memory compression algorithm, necessitated by his pack rat mnemonic</p>
<p class="calibre1">habits when younger, and sometimes the whole universe feels as if it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">nearly on the tip of his tongue. “So, we seem to be in violent</p>
<p class="calibre1">agreement about the need to know more about what’s going on, and to</p>
<p class="calibre1">find out what they’re doing out there. We’ve got cosmic background</p>
<p class="calibre1">anisotropies caused by the waste heat from computing processes</p>
<p class="calibre1">millions of light-years across - it takes a big interstellar</p>
<p class="calibre1">civilization to do that, and they don’t seem to have fallen into the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same rat trap as the local Matrioshka brain civilizations. And we’ve</p>
<p class="calibre1">got worrying rumors about the VO messing around with the structure of</p>
<p class="calibre1">space-time in order to find a way around the Beckenstein bound. If the</p>
<p class="calibre1">VO are trying that, then the folks out near the supercluster already</p>
<p class="calibre1">know the answers. The best way to find out what’s happening is to go</p>
<p class="calibre1">and talk to whoever’s responsible. Can we at least agree on that?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably not.” Her eyes glitter with amusement. “It all depends on</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether one believes in these civilizations in the first place. I know</p>
<p class="calibre1">your people point to deep-field camera images going all the way back</p>
<p class="calibre1">to some wonky hubble-bubble scrying mirror from the late twentieth,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but we’ve got no evidence except some theories about the Casimir</p>
<p class="calibre1">effect and pair production and spinning beakers of helium-3 - much</p>
<p class="calibre1">less proof that whole bunch of alien galactic civilizations are trying</p>
<p class="calibre1">to collapse the false vacuum and destroy the universe!” Her voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">dropped a notch: “At least, not enough proof to convince most people,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manny dear. I know this comes as a shock to you, but not everyone is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">neophiliac posthuman bodysurfer whose idea of a sabbatical is to spend</p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty years as a flock of tightly networked seagulls in order to try</p>
<p class="calibre1">and to prove the Turing Oracle thesis -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not everyone is concerned with the deep future,” Manfred interrupts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s important! If we live or die, that doesn’t matter - that’s not</p>
<p class="calibre1">the big picture. The big question is whether information originating</p>
<p class="calibre1">in our light cone is preserved, or whether we’re stuck in a lossy</p>
<p class="calibre1">medium where our very existence counts for nothing. It’s downright</p>
<p class="calibre1">embarrassing to be a member of a species with such a profound lack of</p>
<p class="calibre1">curiosity about its own future, especially when it affects us all</p>
<p class="calibre1">personally! I mean, if there’s going to come a time when there’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">nobody or nothing to remember us then what does -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Manfred?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He stops in midsentence, his mouth open, staring dumbly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s Amber, poised in black cat suit with cocktail glass. Her</p>
<p class="calibre1">expression is open and confused, appallingly vulnerable. Blue liquid</p>
<p class="calibre1">slops, almost spilling out of her glass - the rim barely extends</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself in time to catch the drops. Behind her stands Annette, a deeply</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-satisfied smile on her face.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You.” Amber pauses, her cheek twitching as bits of her mind page in</p>
<p class="calibre1">and out of her skull, polling external information sources. “You</p>
<p class="calibre1">really are -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">A hasty cloud materializes under her hand as her fingers relax,</p>
<p class="calibre1">dropping the glass.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh.” Manfred stares, at a complete loss for words. “I’d, uh.” After a</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment he looks down. “I’m sorry. I’ll get you another drink ..?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why didn’t someone warn me?” Amber complains.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We thought you could use the good advice,” Annette stated into the</p>
<p class="calibre1">awkward silence. “And a family reunion. It was meant to be a</p>
<p class="calibre1">surprise.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A surprise.” Amber looks perplexed. “You could say that.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re taller than I was expecting,” Manfred says unexpectedly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“People look different when you’re not using human eyes.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah?” She looks at him, and he turns his head slightly, facing her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s a historic moment, and Annette is getting it all on memory</p>
<p class="calibre1">diamond, from every angle. The family’s dirty little secret is that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber and her father have never met, not face-to-face in physical</p>
<p class="calibre1">meat-machine proximity. She was born years after Manfred and Pamela</p>
<p class="calibre1">separated, after all, decanted prefertilized from a tank of liquid</p>
<p class="calibre1">nitrogen. This is the first time either of them have actually seen the</p>
<p class="calibre1">other’s face without electronic intermediation. And while they’ve said</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything that needed to be said on a businesslike level, anthropoid</p>
<p class="calibre1">family politics is still very much a matter of body language and</p>
<p class="calibre1">pheromones. “How long have you been out and about?” she asks, trying</p>
<p class="calibre1">to disguise her confusion.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About six hours.” Manfred manages a rueful chuckle, trying to take</p>
<p class="calibre1">the sight of her in all at once. “Let’s get you another drink and put</p>
<p class="calibre1">our heads together?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.” Amber takes a deep breath and glares at Annette. “You set this</p>
<p class="calibre1">up, you clean up the mess.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette just stands there smiling at the confusion of her</p>
<p class="calibre1">accomplishment.</p>

<p class="calibre1">The cold light of dawn finds Sirhan angry, sober, and ready to pick a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fight with the first person who comes through the door of his office.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The room is about ten meters across, with a floor of polished marble</p>
<p class="calibre1">and skylights in the intricately plastered ceiling. The walkthrough of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his current project sprouts in the middle of the floor like a ghostly</p>
<p class="calibre1">abstract cauliflower, fractal branches dwindling down to infolded</p>
<p class="calibre1">nodes tagged with compressed identifiers. The branches expand and</p>
<p class="calibre1">shrink as Sirhan paces around it, zooming to readability in response</p>
<p class="calibre1">to his eyeball dynamics. But he isn’t paying it much attention. He’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">too disturbed, uncertain, trying to work out whom to blame. Which is</p>
<p class="calibre1">why, when the door bangs open, his first response is to whirl angrily</p>
<p class="calibre1">and open his mouth - then stop. “What do you want?” he demands.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A word, if you please?” Annette looks around distractedly. “This is</p>
<p class="calibre1">your project?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,” he says icily, and banishes the walkthrough with a wave of one</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand. “What do you want?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not sure.” Annette pauses. For a moment she looks weary, tired</p>
<p class="calibre1">beyond mortal words, and Sirhan momentarily wonders if perhaps he’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">spreading the blame too far. This ninetysomething Frenchwoman who is</p>
<p class="calibre1">no blood relative, who was in years past the love of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">scatterbrained grandfather’s life, seems the least likely person to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying to manipulate him, at least in such an unwelcome and intimate</p>
<p class="calibre1">manner. But there’s no telling. Families are strange things, and even</p>
<p class="calibre1">though the current instantiations of his father and mother aren’t the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ones who ran his preadolescent brain through a couple of dozen</p>
<p class="calibre1">alternative lifelines before he was ten, he can’t be sure - or that</p>
<p class="calibre1">they wouldn’t enlist Tante Annette’s assistance in fucking with his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind. “We need to talk about your mother,” she continues.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We do, do we?” Sirhan turns around and sees the vacancy of the room</p>
<p class="calibre1">for what it is, a socket, like a pulled tooth, informed as much by</p>
<p class="calibre1">what is absent as by what is present. He snaps his fingers, and an</p>
<p class="calibre1">intricate bench of translucent bluish utility fog congeals out of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">air behind him. He sits: Annette can do what she wants.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oui.” She thrusts her hands deep into the pocket of the peasant smock</p>
<p class="calibre1">she’s wearing - a major departure from her normal style - and leans</p>
<p class="calibre1">against the wall. Physically, she looks young enough to have spent her</p>
<p class="calibre1">entire life blitzing around the galaxy at three nines of lightspeed,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but her posture is world-weary and ancient. History is a foreign</p>
<p class="calibre1">country, and the old are unwilling emigrants, tired out by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">constant travel. “Your mother, she has taken on a huge job, but it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">one that needs doing. You agreed it needed doing, years ago, with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">archive store. She is now trying to get it moving, that is what the</p>
<p class="calibre1">campaign is about, to place before the electors a choice of how best</p>
<p class="calibre1">to move an entire civilization. So I ask, why do you obstruct her?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan works his jaw; he feels like spitting. “Why?” he snaps.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. Why?” Annette gives in and magics up a chair from the swirling</p>
<p class="calibre1">fogbank beneath the ceiling. She crouches in it, staring at him. “It</p>
<p class="calibre1">is a question.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have nothing against her political machinations,” Sirhan says</p>
<p class="calibre1">tensely. “But her uninvited interference in my personal life -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What interference?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He stares. “Is that a question?” He’s silent for a moment. Then:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Throwing that wanton at me last night -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette stares at him. “Who? What are you talking about?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That, that loose woman!” Sirhan is reduced to spluttering. “False</p>
<p class="calibre1">pretenses! If this is one of Father’s matchmaking ideas, it is so very</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrong that -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette is shaking her head. “Are you crazy? Your mother simply wanted</p>
<p class="calibre1">you to meet her campaign team, to join in planning the policy. Your</p>
<p class="calibre1">father is not on this planet! But you stormed out, you really upset</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rita, did you know that? Rita, she is the best belief maintenance and</p>
<p class="calibre1">story construction operative I have! Yet you to tears reduce her. What</p>
<p class="calibre1">is wrong with you?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I -” Sirhan swallows. “She’s what?” he asks again, his mouth dry. “I</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought …” He trails off. He doesn’t want to say what he thought.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The hussy, that brazen trollop, is part of his mother’s campaign</p>
<p class="calibre1">party? Not some plot to lure him into corruption? What if it was all a</p>
<p class="calibre1">horrible misunderstanding?</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think you need to apologize to someone,” Annette says coolly,</p>
<p class="calibre1">standing up. Sirhan’s head is spinning between a dozen dialogues of</p>
<p class="calibre1">actors and ghosts, a journal of the party replaying before his</p>
<p class="calibre1">ghast-stricken inner gaze. Even the walls have begun to flicker,</p>
<p class="calibre1">responding to his intense unease. Annette skewers him with a disgusted</p>
<p class="calibre1">look: “When you can a woman behave toward as a person, not a threat,</p>
<p class="calibre1">we can again talk. Until then.” And she stands up and walks out of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">room, leaving him to contemplate the shattered stump of his anger, so</p>
<p class="calibre1">startled he can barely concentrate on his project, thinking, Is that</p>
<p class="calibre1">really me? Is that what I look like to her? as the cladistic graph</p>
<p class="calibre1">slowly rotates before him, denuded branches spread wide, waiting to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">filled with the nodes of the alien interstellar network just as soon</p>
<p class="calibre1">as he can convince Aineko to stake him the price of the depth-first</p>
<p class="calibre1">tour of darkness.</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred used to be a flock of pigeons - literally, his exocortex</p>
<p class="calibre1">dispersed among a passel of bird brains, pecking at brightly colored</p>
<p class="calibre1">facts, shitting semidigested conclusions. Being human again feels</p>
<p class="calibre1">inexplicably odd, even without the added distractions of his sex</p>
<p class="calibre1">drive, which he has switched off until he gets used to being unitary</p>
<p class="calibre1">again. Not only does he get shooting pains in his neck whenever he</p>
<p class="calibre1">tries to look over his left shoulder with his right eye, but he’s lost</p>
<p class="calibre1">the habit of spawning exocortical agents to go interrogate a database</p>
<p class="calibre1">or bush robot or something, then report back to him. Instead he keeps</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying to fly off in all directions at once, which usually ends with</p>
<p class="calibre1">him falling over.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">But at present, that’s not a problem. He’s sitting comfortably at a</p>
<p class="calibre1">weathered wooden table in a beer garden behind a hall lifted from</p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhere like Frankfurt, a liter glass of straw-colored liquid at his</p>
<p class="calibre1">elbow and a comforting multiple whispering of knowledge streams</p>
<p class="calibre1">tickling the back of his head. Most of his attention is focused on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette, who frowns at him with mingled concern and affection. They</p>
<p class="calibre1">may have lived separate lives for almost a third of a century, since</p>
<p class="calibre1">she declined to upload with him, but he’s still deeply attuned to her.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You are going to have to do something about that boy,” she says</p>
<p class="calibre1">sympathetically. “He is close enough to upset Amber. And without</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber, there will be a problem.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m going to have to do something about Amber, too,” Manfred retorts.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What was the idea, not warning her I was coming?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was meant to be a surprise.” Annette comes as close to pouting as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred’s seen her recently. It brings back warm memories; he reaches</p>
<p class="calibre1">out to hold her hand across the table.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know I can’t handle the human niceties properly when I’m a</p>
<p class="calibre1">flock.” He strokes the back of her wrist. She pulls back after a</p>
<p class="calibre1">while, but slowly. “I expected you to manage all that stuff.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That stuff.” Annette shakes her head. “She’s your daughter, you know?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Did you have no curiosity left?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As a bird?” Manfred cocks his head to one side so abruptly that he</p>
<p class="calibre1">hurts his neck and winces. “Nope. Now I do, but I think I pissed her</p>
<p class="calibre1">off -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which brings us back to point one.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d send her an apology, but she’d think I was trying to manipulate</p>
<p class="calibre1">her” - Manfred takes a mouthful of beer - “and she’d be right.” He</p>
<p class="calibre1">sounds slightly depressed. “All my relationships are screwy this</p>
<p class="calibre1">decade. And it’s lonely.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So? Don’t brood.” Annette pulls her hand back. “Something will sort</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself out eventually. And in the short term, there is the work, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">electoral problem becomes acute.” When she’s around him the remains of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her once-strong French accent almost vanish in a transatlantic drawl,</p>
<p class="calibre1">he realizes with a pang. He’s been abhuman for too long - people who</p>
<p class="calibre1">meant a lot to him have changed while he’s been away.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll brood if I want to,” he says. “I didn’t ever really get a chance</p>
<p class="calibre1">to say goodbye to Pam, did I? Not after that time in Paris when the</p>
<p class="calibre1">gangsters …” He shrugs. “I’m getting nostalgic in my old age.” He</p>
<p class="calibre1">snorts.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re not the only one,” Annette says tactfully. “Social occasions</p>
<p class="calibre1">here are a minefield, one must tiptoe around so many issues, people</p>
<p class="calibre1">have too much, too much history. And nobody knows everything that is</p>
<p class="calibre1">going on.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s the trouble with this damned polity.” Manfred takes another</p>
<p class="calibre1">gulp of hefeweisen. “We’ve already got six million people living on</p>
<p class="calibre1">this planet, and it’s growing like the first-generation Internet.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone who is anyone knows everyone, but there are so many incomers</p>
<p class="calibre1">diluting the mix and not knowing that there is a small world network</p>
<p class="calibre1">here that everything is up for grabs again after only a couple of</p>
<p class="calibre1">megaseconds. New networks form, and we don’t even know they exist</p>
<p class="calibre1">until they sprout a political agenda and surface under us. We’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">acting under time pressure. If we don’t get things rolling now, we’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">never be able to …” He shakes his head. “It wasn’t like this for you</p>
<p class="calibre1">in Brussels, was it?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No. Brussels was a mature system. And I had Gianni to look after in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his dotage after you left. It will only get worse from here on in, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">think.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Democracy 2.0.” He shudders briefly. “I’m not sure about the validity</p>
<p class="calibre1">of voting projects at all, these days. The assumption that all people</p>
<p class="calibre1">are of equal importance seems frighteningly obsolescent. Do you think</p>
<p class="calibre1">we can make this fly?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t see why not. If Amber’s willing to play the People’s Princess</p>
<p class="calibre1">for us …” Annette picks up a slice of liverwurst and chews on it</p>
<p class="calibre1">meditatively.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not sure it’s workable, however we play it.” Manfred looks</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughtful. “The whole democratic participation thing looks</p>
<p class="calibre1">questionable to me under these circumstances. We’re under direct</p>
<p class="calibre1">threat, for all that it’s a long-term one, and this whole culture is</p>
<p class="calibre1">in danger of turning into a classical nation-state. Or worse, several</p>
<p class="calibre1">of them layered on top of one another with complete geographical</p>
<p class="calibre1">collocation but no social interpenetration. I’m not certain it’s a</p>
<p class="calibre1">good idea to try to steer something like that - pieces might break</p>
<p class="calibre1">off, you’d get the most unpleasant side-effects. Although, on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">other hand, if we can mobilize enough broad support to become the</p>
<p class="calibre1">first visible planetwide polity …”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We need you to stay focused,” Annette adds unexpectedly.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Focused? Me?” He laughs, briefly. “I used to have an idea a second.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now it’s maybe one a year. I’m just a melancholy old birdbrain, me.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, but you know the old saying? The fox has many ideas - the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hedgehog has only one, but it’s a big idea.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So tell me, what is my big idea?” Manfred leans forward, one elbow on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the table, one eye focused on inner space as a hot-burning thread of</p>
<p class="calibre1">consciousness barks psephological performance metrics at him,</p>
<p class="calibre1">analysing the game ahead. “Where do you think I’m going?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think -” Annette breaks off suddenly, staring past his shoulder.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Privacy slips, and for a frozen moment Manfred glances round in mild</p>
<p class="calibre1">horror and sees thirty or forty other guests in the crowded garden,</p>
<p class="calibre1">elbows rubbing, voices raised above the background chatter: “Gianni!”</p>
<p class="calibre1">She beams widely as she stands up. “What a surprise! When did you</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrive?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred blinks. A slim young guy, moving with adolescent grace, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">none of the awkward movements and sullen lack of poise - he’s much</p>
<p class="calibre1">older than he looks, chickenhawk genetics. Gianni? He feels a huge</p>
<p class="calibre1">surge of memories paging through his exocortex. He remembers ringing a</p>
<p class="calibre1">doorbell in dusty, hot Rome: white toweling bathrobe, the economics of</p>
<p class="calibre1">scarcity, autograph signed by the dead hand of von Neumann - “Gianni?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">he asks, disbelieving. “It’s been a long time!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gilded youth, incarnated in the image of a metropolitan toy-boy</p>
<p class="calibre1">from the noughties, grins widely and embraces Manfred with a friendly</p>
<p class="calibre1">bear hug. Then he slides down onto the bench next to Annette, whom he</p>
<p class="calibre1">kisses with easy familiarity. “Ah, to be among friends again! It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">been too long!” He glances round curiously. “Hmm, how very Bavarian.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">He snaps his fingers. “Mine will be a, what do you recommend? It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">been too long since my last beer.” His grin widens. “Not in this</p>
<p class="calibre1">body.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re resimulated?” Manfred asks, unable to stop himself.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette frowns at him disapprovingly: “No, silly! He came through the</p>
<p class="calibre1">teleport gate -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh.” Manfred shakes his head. “I’m sorry -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s okay.” Gianni Vittoria clearly doesn’t mind being mistaken for a</p>
<p class="calibre1">historical newbie, rather than someone who’s traveled through the</p>
<p class="calibre1">decades the hard way. He must be over a hundred by now, Manfred notes,</p>
<p class="calibre1">not bothering to spawn a search thread to find out.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was time to move and, well, the old body didn’t want to move with</p>
<p class="calibre1">me, so why not go gracefully and accept the inevitable?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t take you for a dualist,” Manfred says ruefully.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, I’m not - but neither am I reckless.” Gianni drops his grin for a</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment. The sometime minister for transhuman affairs, economic</p>
<p class="calibre1">theoretician, then retired tribal elder of the polycognitive liberals</p>
<p class="calibre1">is serious. “I have never uploaded before, or switched bodies, or</p>
<p class="calibre1">teleported. Even when my old one was seriously - tcha! Maybe I left it</p>
<p class="calibre1">too long. But here I am, one planet is as good as another to be cloned</p>
<p class="calibre1">and downloaded onto, don’t you think?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You invited him?” Manfred asks Annette.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why wouldn’t I?” There’s a wicked gleam in her eye. “Did you expect</p>
<p class="calibre1">me to live like a nun while you were a flock of pigeons? We may have</p>
<p class="calibre1">campaigned against the legal death of the transubstantiated, Manfred,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but there are limits.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred looks between them, then shrugs, embarrassed. “I’m still</p>
<p class="calibre1">getting used to being human again,” he admits. “Give me time to catch</p>
<p class="calibre1">up? At an emotional level, at least.” The realization that Gianni and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Annette have a history together doesn’t come as a surprise to him:</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s one of the things you must adapt to if you opt out of the human</p>
<p class="calibre1">species, after all. At least the libido suppression is helping here,</p>
<p class="calibre1">he realizes: He’s not about to embarrass anyone by suggesting a</p>
<p class="calibre1">m�nage. He focuses on Gianni. “I have a feeling I’m here for a</p>
<p class="calibre1">purpose, and it isn’t mine,” he says slowly. “Why don’t you tell me</p>
<p class="calibre1">what you’ve got in mind?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gianni shrugs. “You have the big picture already. We are human,</p>
<p class="calibre1">metahuman, and augmented human. But the posthumans are things that</p>
<p class="calibre1">were never really human to begin with. The Vile Offspring have reached</p>
<p class="calibre1">their adolescence and want the place to themselves so they can throw a</p>
<p class="calibre1">party. The writing is on the wall, don’t you think?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred gives him a long stare. “The whole idea of running away in</p>
<p class="calibre1">meatspace is fraught with peril,” he says slowly. He picks up his mug</p>
<p class="calibre1">of beer and swirls it around slowly. “Look, we know, now, that a</p>
<p class="calibre1">singularity doesn’t turn into a voracious predator that eats all the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dumb matter in its path, triggering a phase change in the structure of</p>
<p class="calibre1">space - at least, not unless they’ve done something very stupid to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">structure of the false vacuum, somewhere outside our current light</p>
<p class="calibre1">cone.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But if we run away, we are still going to be there. Sooner or later,</p>
<p class="calibre1">we’ll have the same problem all over again; runaway intelligence</p>
<p class="calibre1">augmentation, self-expression, engineered intelligences, whatever.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Possibly that’s what happened out past the B�otes void - not a</p>
<p class="calibre1">galactic-scale civilization, but a race of pathological cowards</p>
<p class="calibre1">fleeing their own exponential transcendence. We carry the seeds of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">singularity with us wherever we go, and if we try to excise those</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeds, we cease to be human, don’t we? So … maybe you can tell me</p>
<p class="calibre1">what you think we should do. Hmm?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s a dilemma.” A waitron inserts itself into their privacy-screened</p>
<p class="calibre1">field of view. It plants a spun-diamond glass in front of Gianni, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">pukes beer into it. Manfred declines a refill, waiting for Gianni to</p>

<p class="calibre1">with your daughter, Manny. She loaned me her experiential digest of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the journey to Hyundai +4904/[-56]. I found it quite alarming.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nobody’s casting aspersions on her observations, not after that</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-propelled stock market bubble or 419 scam or whatever it was got</p>
<p class="calibre1">loose in the Economics 2.0 sphere, but the implications - the Vile</p>
<p class="calibre1">Offspring will eat the solar system, Manny. Then they’ll slow down.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But where does that leave us, I ask you? What is there for orthohumans</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred nods thoughtfully. “You’ve heard the argument between the</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Of course.” Gianni takes a long pull on his beer. “What do you think</p>
<p class="calibre1">of our options?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The accelerationistas want to upload everyone onto a fleet of</p>
<p class="calibre1">starwhisps and charge off to colonize an uninhabited brown dwarf</p>
<p class="calibre1">planetary system. Or maybe steal a Matrioshka brain that’s succumbed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to senile dementia and turn it back into planetary biomes with cores</p>
<p class="calibre1">of diamond-phase computronium to fulfil some kind of demented</p>
<p class="calibre1">pastoralist nostalgia trip. Rousseau’s universal robots. I gather</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber thinks this is a good idea because she’s done it before - at</p>
<p class="calibre1">least, the charging off aboard a starwhisp part. ‘To boldly go where</p>
<p class="calibre1">no uploaded metahuman colony fleet has gone before’ has a certain ring</p>
<p class="calibre1">to it, doesn’t it?” Manfred nods to himself. “Like I say, it won’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">work. We’d be right back to iteration one of the waterfall model of</p>
<p class="calibre1">singularity formation within a couple of gigaseconds of arriving.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s why I came back: to warn her.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So?” Gianni prods, pretending to ignore the frowns that Annette is</p>
<p class="calibre1">casting his way.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And as for the time-binders,” Manfred nods again, “they’re like</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan. Deeply conservative, deeply suspicious. Holding out for</p>
<p class="calibre1">staying here as long as possible, until the Vile Offspring come for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Saturn - then moving out bit by bit, into the Kuiper belt. Colony</p>
<p class="calibre1">habitats on snowballs half a light-year from anywhere.” He shudders.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Spam in a fucking can with a light-hour walk to the nearest civilized</p>
<p class="calibre1">company if your fellow inmates decide to reinvent Stalinism or</p>
<p class="calibre1">Objectivism. No thanks! I know they’ve been muttering about quantum</p>
<p class="calibre1">teleportation and stealing toys from the routers, but I’ll believe it</p>
<p class="calibre1">when I see it.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which leaves what?” Annette demands. “It is all very well, this</p>
<p class="calibre1">dismissal of both the accelerationista and time-binder programs,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manny, but what can you propose in their place?” She looks distressed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fifty years ago, you would have had six new ideas before breakfast!</p>
<p class="calibre1">And an erection.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred leers at her unconvincingly. “Who says I can’t still have</p>
<p class="calibre1">both?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She glares. “Drop it!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.” Manfred chugs back a quarter of a liter of beer, draining his</p>
<p class="calibre1">glass, and puts it down on the table with a bang. “As it happens, I do</p>
<p class="calibre1">have an alternative idea.” He looks serious. “I’ve been discussing it</p>
<p class="calibre1">with Aineko for some time, and Aineko has been seeding Sirhan with it</p>
<p class="calibre1">- if it’s to work optimally, we’ll need to get a rump constituency of</p>
<p class="calibre1">both the accelerationistas and the conservatives on board. Which is</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rita shrugs. “Some boringly prolix pulp author from the early</p>
<p class="calibre1">twentieth, with a body phobia of extropian proportions - I kept</p>
<p class="calibre1">expecting him to start drooling and rolling his eyes if I crossed my</p>
<p class="calibre1">legs. Funny thing is, he was also close to bolting from fear once I</p>
<p class="calibre1">mentioned implants. We really need to nail down how to deal with these</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind/body dualists, don’t we?” She watches Amber with something</p>
<p class="calibre1">approaching admiration; she’s new to the inner circle of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">accelerationista study faction, and Amber’s social credit is sky-high.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rita’s got a lot to learn from her, if she can get close enough. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">right now, following her along a path through the landscaped garden</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind the museum seems like a golden moment of opportunity.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber smiles. “I’m glad I’m not processing immigrants these days; most</p>
<p class="calibre1">of them are so stupid it drives you up the wall after a bit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Personally I blame the Flynn effect - in reverse. They come from a</p>
<p class="calibre1">background of sensory deprivation. It’s nothing that a course of</p>
<p class="calibre1">neural growth enhancers can’t fix in a year or two, but after the</p>
<p class="calibre1">first few you skullfuck, they’re all the same. So dull. Unless you’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">unlucky enough to get one of the documentees from a puritan religious</p>

<p class="calibre1">superstitious, woman-hating clergyman, I’m going to consider</p>
<p class="calibre1">prescribing forcible gender reassignment surgery. At least the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Victorian English are mostly just open-minded lechers, when you get</p>
<p class="calibre1">past their social reserve. And they like new technology.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rita nods. Woman-hating <i class="calibre5">et cetera</i> … The echoes of patriarchy are</p>
<p class="calibre1">still with them today, it seems, and not just in the form of</p>
<p class="calibre1">resimulated ayatollahs and archbishops from the Dark Ages. “My author</p>
<p class="calibre1">sounds like the worst of both. Some guy called Howard, from Rhode</p>
<p class="calibre1">Island. Kept looking at me as if he was afraid I was going to sprout</p>

<p class="calibre1">Just what was he thinking, anyway? she wonders. To be that screwed up</p>
<p class="calibre1">takes serious dedication … “What are you working on, if you don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">mind me asking?” she asks, trying to change the direction of her</p>
<p class="calibre1">attention.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, pressing the flesh, I guess. Auntie ‘Nette wanted me to meet some</p>
<p class="calibre1">old political hack contact of hers who she figures can help with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">program, but he was holed up with her and Dad all day.” She pulls a</p>
<p class="calibre1">face. “I had another fitting session with the image merchants, they’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying to turn me into a political catwalk clotheshorse. Then there’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">the program demographics again. We’re getting about a thousand new</p>
<p class="calibre1">immigrants a day, planetwide, but it’s accelerating rapidly, and we</p>
<p class="calibre1">should be up to eighty an hour by the time of the election. Which is</p>
<p class="calibre1">going to be a huge problem, because if we start campaigning too early,</p>
<p class="calibre1">a quarter of the electorate won’t know what they’re meant to be voting</p>
<p class="calibre1">about.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe it’s deliberate,” Rita suggests. “The Vile Offspring are trying</p>
<p class="calibre1">to rig the outcome by injecting voters.” She pings a smiley emoticon</p>
<p class="calibre1">off Wednesday’s open channel, raising a flickering grin in return.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The party of fuckwits will win, no question about it.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh-huh.” Amber snaps her fingers and pulls an impatient face as she</p>
<p class="calibre1">waits for a passing cloud to solidify above her head and lower a glass</p>
<p class="calibre1">of cranberry juice to her. “Dad said one thing that’s spot-on, we’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">framing this entire debate in terms of what we should do to avoid</p>
<p class="calibre1">conflict with the Offspring. The main bone of contention is how to run</p>
<p class="calibre1">away and how far to go and which program to put resources into, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether or when to run, let alone what else we could do. Maybe we</p>
<p class="calibre1">should have given it some more thought. Are we being manipulated?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rita looks vacant for a moment. “Is that a question?” she asks. Amber</p>
<p class="calibre1">nods, and she shakes her head. “Then I’d have to say that I don’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">know. The evidence is inconclusive, so far. But I’m not really happy.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Offspring won’t tell us what they want, but there’s no reason to</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe they don’t know what we want. I mean, they can think rings</p>
<p class="calibre1">round us, can’t they?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber shrugs, then pauses to unlatch a hedge gate that gives admission</p>
<p class="calibre1">to a maze of sweet-smelling shrubs. “I really don’t know. They may not</p>
<p class="calibre1">care about us, or even remember we exist - the resimulants may be</p>
<p class="calibre1">being generated by some autonomic mechanism, not really part of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">higher consciousness of the Offspring. Or it may be some whacked-out</p>
<p class="calibre1">post-Tiplerite meme that’s gotten hold of more processing resources</p>
<p class="calibre1">than the entire presingularity Net, some kind of MetaMormon project</p>
<p class="calibre1">directed at ensuring that everyone who can possibly ever have lived</p>
<p class="calibre1">lives in the right way to fit some weird quasi-religious requirement</p>
<p class="calibre1">we don’t know about. Or it might be a message we’re simply not smart</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough to decode. That’s the trouble, we don’t know.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She vanishes around the curve of the maze. Rita hurries to catch up,</p>
<p class="calibre1">sees her about to turn into another alleyway, and leaps after her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What else?” she pants.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Could be” - left turn - “anything, really.” Six steps lead down into</p>
<p class="calibre1">a shadowy tunnel; fork right, five meters forward, then six steps up</p>
<p class="calibre1">lead back to the surface. “Question is, why don’t they” - left turn -</p>
<p class="calibre1">“just tell us what they want?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Speaking to tapeworms.” Rita nearly manages to catch up with Amber,</p>
<p class="calibre1">who is trotting through the maze as if she’s memorized it perfectly.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s how much the nascent Matrioshka brain can outthink us by, as</p>
<p class="calibre1">humans to segmented worms. Would we do. What they told us?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe.” Amber stops dead, and Rita glances around. They’re in an open</p>
<p class="calibre1">cell near the heart of the maze, five meters square, hedged in on all</p>
<p class="calibre1">sides. There are three entrances and a slate altar, waist high,</p>
<p class="calibre1">lichen-stained with age. “I think you know the answer to that</p>
<p class="calibre1">question.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I -” Rita stares at her.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber stares back, eyes dark and intense. “You’re from one of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ganymede orbitals by way of Titan. You knew my eigensister while I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of the solar system flying a diamond the size of a Coke can.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s what you told me. You’ve got a skill set that’s a perfect match</p>
<p class="calibre1">for the campaign research group, and you asked me to introduce you to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan, then you pushed his buttons like a pro. Just what are you</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying to pull? Why should I trust you?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I -” Rita’s face crumples. “I didn’t push his buttons! He thought I</p>
<p class="calibre1">was trying to drag him into bed.” She looks up defiantly. “I wasn’t, I</p>
<p class="calibre1">want to learn, what makes you - him - work -” Huge, dark, structured</p>
<p class="calibre1">information queries batter at her exocortex, triggering warnings.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone is churning through distributed time-series databases all over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the outer system, measuring her past with a micrometer. She stares at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber, mortified and angry. It’s the ultimate denial of trust, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">need to check her statements against the public record for truth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you doing?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I have a suspicion.” Amber stands poised, as if ready to run. Run</p>
<p class="calibre1">away from me? Rita thinks, startled. “You said, what if the</p>
<p class="calibre1">resimulants came from a subconscious function of the Offspring? And</p>
<p class="calibre1">funnily enough, I’ve been discussing that possibility with Dad. He’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">still got the spark when you show him a problem, you know.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t understand!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I don’t think you do,” says Amber, and Rita can feel vast</p>
<p class="calibre1">stresses in the space around her: The whole ubicomp environment,</p>
<p class="calibre1">dust-sized chips and utility fog and hazy clouds of diamond-bright</p>
<p class="calibre1">optical processors in the soil and the air and her skin, is growing</p>
<p class="calibre1">blotchy and sluggish, thrashing under the load of whatever Amber -</p>
<p class="calibre1">with her management-grade ackles - is ordering it to do. For a moment,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rita can’t feel half her mind, and she gets the panicky claustrophobic</p>
<p class="calibre1">sense of being trapped inside her own head: Then it stops.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell me!” Rita insists. “What are you trying to prove? It’s some</p>
<p class="calibre1">mistake -” And Amber is nodding, much to her surprise, looking weary</p>
<p class="calibre1">and morose. “What do you think I’ve done?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing. You’re coherent. Sorry about that.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Coherent?” Rita hears her voice rising with her indignation as she</p>
<p class="calibre1">feels bits of herself, cut off from her for whole seconds, shivering</p>
<p class="calibre1">with relief. “I’ll give you coherent! Assaulting my exocortex -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shut up.” Amber rubs her face and simultaneously throws Rita one end</p>
<p class="calibre1">of an encrypted channel.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why should I?” Rita demands, not accepting the handshake.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because.” Amber glances round. She’s scared! Rita suddenly realizes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just do it,” she hisses.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rita accepts the endpoint and a huge lump of undigested expository</p>
<p class="calibre1">data slides down it, structured and tagged with entry points and</p>
<p class="calibre1">metainformation directories pointing to -</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Holy shit!” she whispers, as she realizes what it is.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” Amber grins humorlessly. She continues, over the open channel:</p>
<p class="calibre1">It looks like they’re cognitive antibodies, generated by the devil’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">own semiotic immune system. That’s what Sirhan is focusing on, how to</p>
<p class="calibre1">avoid triggering them and bringing everything down at once. Forget the</p>
<p class="calibre1">election, we’re going to be in deep shit sooner rather than later, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">we’re still trying to work out how to survive. Now are you sure you</p>

<p class="calibre1">ago, the bit rate on the resimulation stream jumped. We’re now</p>
<p class="calibre1">fielding about one resimulated state vector a second, on top of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">legitimate immigration we’re dealing with. If it jumps again by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same factor, it’s going to swamp our ability to check the immigrants</p>
<p class="calibre1">for zimboes in vivo - we’d have to move to running them in secure</p>
<p class="calibre1">storage or just resurrecting them blind, and if there are any jokers</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the pack, that’s about the riskiest thing we could do.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why do you not spool them to memory diamond?” asks the handsome young</p>
<p class="calibre1">ex-politician to his left, looking almost amused - as if he already</p>
<p class="calibre1">knows the answer.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Politics.” Manfred shrugs.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It would blow a hole in our social contract,” says Amber, looking as</p>
<p class="calibre1">if she’s just swallowed something unpleasant, and Rita feels a flicker</p>
<p class="calibre1">of admiration for the way they’re stage-managing the meeting. Amber’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">even talking to her father, as if she feels comfortable with him</p>
<p class="calibre1">around, although he’s a walking reminder of her own lack of success.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nobody else has gotten a word in yet. “If we don’t instantiate them,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the next logical step is to deny resimulated minds the franchise.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Which in turn puts us on the road to institutional inequality. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">that’s a very big step to take, even if you have misgivings about the</p>
<p class="calibre1">idea of settling complex policy issues on the basis of a popular vote,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because our whole polity is based on the idea that less competent</p>
<p class="calibre1">intelligences - us - deserve consideration.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hrmph.” Someone clears their throat. Rita glances round and freezes,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because it’s Amber’s screwed-up eigenchild, and he’s just about</p>
<p class="calibre1">materialized in the chair next to her. So he adopted Superplonk after</p>
<p class="calibre1">all? she observes cynically. He doggedly avoids looking at her. “That</p>
<p class="calibre1">was my analysis,” he says reluctantly. “We need them alive. For the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ark option, at least, and if not, even the accelerationista platform</p>
<p class="calibre1">will need them on hand later.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Concentration camps, thinks Rita, trying to ignore Sirhan’s presence</p>
<p class="calibre1">near her, for it’s a constant irritant, where most of the inmates are</p>
<p class="calibre1">confused, frightened human beings - and the ones who aren’t think they</p>
<p class="calibre1">are. It’s an eerie thought, and she spawns a couple of full ghosts to</p>
<p class="calibre1">dream it through for her, gaming the possible angles.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How are your negotiations over the lifeboat designs going?” Amber</p>
<p class="calibre1">asks her father. “We need to get a portfolio of design schemata out</p>
<p class="calibre1">before we go into the election -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Change of plan.” Manfred hunches forward. “This doesn’t need to go</p>
<p class="calibre1">any further, but Sirhan and Aineko have come up with something</p>
<p class="calibre1">interesting.” He looks worried.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan is staring at his eigenmother with narrowed eyes, and Rita has</p>
<p class="calibre1">to resist the urge to elbow him savagely in the ribs. She knows enough</p>
<p class="calibre1">about him now to realize it wouldn’t get his attention - at least, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">the way she’d want it, not for the right reasons - and in any case,</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’s more wrapped up in himself than her ghost ever saw him as likely</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be. (How anyone could be party to such a detailed exchange of</p>
<p class="calibre1">simulated lives and still reject the opportunity to do it in real life</p>
<p class="calibre1">is beyond her; unless it’s an artifact of his youth, when his parents</p>
<p class="calibre1">pushed him through a dozen simulated childhoods in search of knowledge</p>
<p class="calibre1">and ended up with a stubborn oyster-head of a son …) “We still need</p>
<p class="calibre1">to look as if we’re planning on using a lifeboat,” he says aloud.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s the small matter of the price they’re asking in return for</p>
<p class="calibre1">the alternative.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What? What are you talking about?” Amber sounds confused. “I thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">you were working on some kind of cladistic map. What’s this about a</p>
<p class="calibre1">price?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan smiles coolly. “I am working on a cladistic map, in a manner of</p>
<p class="calibre1">speaking. You wasted much of your opportunity when you journeyed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the router, you know. I’ve been talking to Aineko.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You -” Amber flushes. “What about?” She’s visibly angry, Rita</p>
<p class="calibre1">notices. Sirhan is needling his eigenmother. Why?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About the topology of some rather interesting types of small-world</p>
<p class="calibre1">network.” Sirhan leans back in his chair, watching the cloud above her</p>
<p class="calibre1">head. “And the router. You went through it, then you came back with</p>
<p class="calibre1">your tail between your legs as fast as you could, didn’t you? Not even</p>
<p class="calibre1">checking your passenger to see if it was a hostile parasite.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t have to take this,” Amber says tightly. “You weren’t there,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and you have no idea what constraints we were working under.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?” Sirhan raises an eyebrow. “Anyway, you missed an</p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunity. We know that the routers - for whatever reason - are</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-replicating. They spread from brown dwarf to brown dwarf, hatch,</p>
<p class="calibre1">tap the protostar for energy and material, and send a bunch of</p>
<p class="calibre1">children out. Von Neumann machines, in other words. We also know that</p>
<p class="calibre1">they provide high-bandwidth communications to other routers. When you</p>
<p class="calibre1">went through the one at Hyundai +4904/[-56], you ended up in an</p>
<p class="calibre1">unmaintained DMZ attached to an alien Matrioshka brain that had</p>
<p class="calibre1">degenerated, somehow. It follows that someone had collected a router</p>
<p class="calibre1">and carried it home, to link into the MB. So why didn’t you bring one</p>
<p class="calibre1">home with you?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber glares at him. “Total payload on board the Field Circus was</p>
<p class="calibre1">about ten grams. How large do you think a router seed is?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So you brought the Slug home instead, occupying maybe half your</p>
<p class="calibre1">storage capacity and ready to wreak seven shades of havoc on -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Children!” They both look round automatically. It’s Annette, Rita</p>
<p class="calibre1">realizes, and she doesn’t look amused. “Why do you not save this</p>
<p class="calibre1">bickering for later?” she asks. “We have our own goals to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">pursuing.” Unamused is an understatement. Annette is fuming.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This charming family reunion was your idea, I believe?” Manfred</p>
<p class="calibre1">smiles at her, then nods coolly at the retread EU politician in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">next seat.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please.” It’s Amber. “Dad, can you save this for later?” Rita sits</p>
<p class="calibre1">up. For a moment, Amber looks ancient, far older than her subjective</p>
<p class="calibre1">gigasecond of age. “She’s right. She didn’t mean to screw up. Let’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">leave the family history for some time when we can work it out in</p>
<p class="calibre1">private. Okay?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred looks abashed. He blinks rapidly. “All right.” He takes a</p>
<p class="calibre1">breath. “Amber, I brought some old acquaintances into the loop. If we</p>
<p class="calibre1">win the election, then to get out of here as fast as possible, we’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">have to use a combination of the two main ideas we’ve been discussing:</p>
<p class="calibre1">spool as many people as possible into high-density storage until we</p>
<p class="calibre1">get somewhere with space and mass and energy to reincarnate them, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">get our hands on a router. The entire planetary polity can’t afford to</p>
<p class="calibre1">pay the energy budget of a relativistic starship big enough to hold</p>
<p class="calibre1">everyone, even as uploads, and a subrelativistic ship would be too</p>
<p class="calibre1">damn vulnerable to the Vile Offspring. And it follows that, instead of</p>
<p class="calibre1">taking potluck on the destination, we should learn about the network</p>
<p class="calibre1">protocols the routers use, figure out some kind of transferable</p>
<p class="calibre1">currency we can use to pay for our reinstantiation at the other end,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and also how to make some kind of map so we know where we’re going.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The two hard parts are getting at or to a router, and paying - that’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">going to mean traveling with someone who understands Economics 2.0 but</p>
<p class="calibre1">doesn’t want to hang around the Vile Offspring.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As it happens, these old acquaintances of mine went out and fetched</p>
<p class="calibre1">back a router seed, for their own purposes. It’s sitting about thirty</p>
<p class="calibre1">light-hours away from here, out in the Kuiper belt. They’re trying to</p>
<p class="calibre1">hatch it right now. And I think Aineko might be willing to go with us</p>
<p class="calibre1">and handle the trade negotiations.” He raises the palm of his right</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand and flips a bundle of tags into the shared spatial cache of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">inner circle’s memories.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lobsters. Decades ago, back in the dim wastelands of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">depression-ridden naughty oughties, the uploaded lobsters had escaped.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred brokered a deal for them to get their very own cometary</p>
<p class="calibre1">factory colony. Years later, Amber’s expedition to the router had run</p>
<p class="calibre1">into eerie zombie lobsters, upload images that had been taken over and</p>
<p class="calibre1">reanimated by the Wunch. But where the real lobsters had gotten to …</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">For a moment, Rita sees herself hovering in darkness and vacuum, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">distant siren song of a planetary gravity well far below. Off to her -</p>
<p class="calibre1">left? north? - glows a hazy dim red cloud the size of the full moon as</p>
<p class="calibre1">seen from Earth, a cloud that hums with a constant background noise,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the waste heat of a galactic civilization dreaming furious colorless</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughts to itself. Then she figures out how to slew her unblinking,</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyeless viewpoint round and sees the craft.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s a starship in the shape of a crustacean three kilometers long.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s segmented and flattened, with legs projecting from the abdominal</p>
<p class="calibre1">floor to stretch stiffly sideways and clutch fat balloons of cryogenic</p>
<p class="calibre1">deuterium fuel. The blue metallic tail is a flattened fan wrapped</p>
<p class="calibre1">around the delicate stinger of a fusion reactor. Near the head, things</p>
<p class="calibre1">are different: no huge claws there, but the delicately branching fuzz</p>
<p class="calibre1">of bush robots, nanoassemblers poised ready to repair damage in flight</p>
<p class="calibre1">and spin the parachute of a ramscoop when the ship is ready to</p>
<p class="calibre1">decelerate. The head is massively armored against the blitzkrieg</p>
<p class="calibre1">onslaught of interstellar dust, its radar eyes a glint of hexagonal</p>
<p class="calibre1">compound surfaces staring straight at her.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind and below the lobster-ship, a planetary ring looms vast and</p>
<p class="calibre1">tenuous. The lobster is in orbit around Saturn, mere light-seconds</p>
<p class="calibre1">away. And as Rita stares at the ship in dumbstruck silence, it winks</p>
<p class="calibre1">at her.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They don’t have names, at least not as individual identifiers,”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred says apologetically, “so I asked if he’d mind being called</p>
<p class="calibre1">something. He said Blue, because he is. So I give you the good lobster</p>
<p class="calibre1">Something Blue.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan interrupts, “You still need my cladistics project,” he sounds</p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhat smug, “to find your way through the network. Do you have a</p>
<p class="calibre1">specific destination in mind?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, to both questions,” Manfred admits. “We need to send duplicate</p>
<p class="calibre1">ghosts out to each possible router end point, wait for an echo, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">iterate and repeat. Recursive depth-first traversal. The goal - that’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">harder.” He points at the ceiling, which dissolves into a chaotic 3-D</p>
<p class="calibre1">spiderweb that Rita recognizes, after some hours of subjective</p>
<p class="calibre1">head-down archive time, as a map of the dark matter distribution</p>
<p class="calibre1">throughout a radius of a billion light-years, galaxies glued like</p>
<p class="calibre1">fluff to the nodes where strands of drying silk meet. “We’ve known for</p>
<p class="calibre1">most of a century that there’s something flaky going on out there, out</p>
<p class="calibre1">past the B�otes void - there are a couple of galactic superclusters,</p>
<p class="calibre1">around which there’s something flaky about the cosmic background</p>
<p class="calibre1">anisotropy. Most computational processes generate entropy as a</p>
<p class="calibre1">by-product, and it looks like something is dumping waste heat into the</p>
<p class="calibre1">area from all the galaxies in the region, very evenly spread in a way</p>
<p class="calibre1">that mirrors the metal distribution in those galaxies, except at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">very cores. And according to the lobsters, who have been indulging in</p>
<p class="calibre1">some very long baseline interferometry, most of the stars in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">nearest cluster are redder than expected and metal-depleted. As if</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone’s been mining them.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah.” Sirhan stares at his grandfather. “Why should they be any</p>
<p class="calibre1">different from the local nodes?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look around you. Do you see any indications of large-scale cosmic</p>
<p class="calibre1">engineering within a million light-years of here?” Manfred shrugs.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Locally, nothing has quite reached … well. We can guess at the life</p>
<p class="calibre1">cycle of a post spike civilization now, can’t we? We’ve felt the</p>
<p class="calibre1">elephant. We’ve seen the wreckage of collapsed Matrioshka minds. We</p>
<p class="calibre1">know how unattractive exploration is to postsingularity intelligences,</p>
<p class="calibre1">we’ve seen the bandwidth gap that keeps them at home.” He points at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the ceiling. “But over there something different happened. They’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">making changes on the scale of an entire galactic supercluster, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">they appear to be coordinated. They did get out and go places, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">their descendants may still be out there. It looks like they’re doing</p>
<p class="calibre1">something purposeful and coordinated, something vast - a timing</p>
<p class="calibre1">channel attack on the virtual machine that’s running the universe,</p>
<p class="calibre1">perhaps, or an embedded simulation of an entirely different universe.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Up or down, is it turtles all the way, or is there something out there</p>
<p class="calibre1">that’s more real than we are? And don’t you think it’s worth trying to</p>
<p class="calibre1">find out?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” Sirhan crosses his arms. “Not particularly. I’m interested in</p>
<p class="calibre1">saving people from the Vile Offspring, not taking a huge gamble on</p>
<p class="calibre1">mystery transcendent aliens who may have built a galaxy-sized reality</p>
<p class="calibre1">hacking machine a billion years ago. I’ll sell you my services, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">even send a ghost along, but if you expect me to bet my entire future</p>
<p class="calibre1">on it …”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s too much for Rita. Diverting her attention away from the dizzying</p>
<p class="calibre1">inner-space vista, she elbows Sirhan in the ribs. He looks round</p>
<p class="calibre1">blankly for a moment, then with gathering anger as he lets his</p>
<p class="calibre1">killfile filter slip. “Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be</p>
<p class="calibre1">silent,” she hisses. Then, succumbing to a secondary impulse she knows</p>
<p class="calibre1">she’ll regret later, she drops a private channel into his public</p>
<p class="calibre1">in-tray.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nobody’s asking you to,” Manfred is saying defensively, arms crossed.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I view this as a Manhattan project kind of thing, pursue all agendas</p>
<p class="calibre1">in parallel. If we win the election, we’ll have the resources we need</p>
<p class="calibre1">to do that. We should all go through the router, and we will all leave</p>
<p class="calibre1">backups aboard Something Blue. Blue is slow, tops out at about a tenth</p>
<p class="calibre1">of cee, but what he can do is get a sufficient quantity of memory</p>
<p class="calibre1">diamond the hell out of circumsolar space before the Vile Offspring’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">autonomic defenses activate whatever kind of trust exploit they’re</p>
<p class="calibre1">planning in the next few megaseconds -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you want?” Sirhan demands angrily over the channel. He’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">still not looking at her, and not just because he’s focusing on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">vision in blue that dominates the shared space of the team meeting.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop lying to yourself,” Rita sends back. “You’re lying about your</p>
<p class="calibre1">own goals and motivations. You may not want to know the truth your own</p>
<p class="calibre1">ghost worked out, but I do. And I’m not going to let you deny it</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So one of your agents seduced a personality image of me -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bullshit -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you mean to declare this platform openly?” asks the young-old guy</p>
<p class="calibre1">near the platform, the Europol. “Because if so, you’re going to</p>
<p class="calibre1">undermine Amber’s campaign -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s all right,” Amber says tiredly, “I’m used to Dad supporting me</p>
<p class="calibre1">in his own inimitable way.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is okay,” says a new voice. “I are happy wait-state grazing in</p>
<p class="calibre1">ecliptic.” It’s the friendly lobster lifeboat, light-lagged by its</p>
<p class="calibre1">trajectory outside the ring system.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“- You’re happy to hide behind a hypocritical sense of moral purity</p>
<p class="calibre1">when it makes you feel you can look down on other people, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">underneath it you’re just like everyone else -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“- She set you up to corrupt me, didn’t she? You’re just bait in her</p>
<p class="calibre1">scheme -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The idea was to store incremental backups in the Panuliran’s cargo</p>
<p class="calibre1">cache in case a weakly godlike agency from the inner system attempts</p>
<p class="calibre1">to activate the antibodies they’ve already disseminated throughout the</p>
<p class="calibre1">festival culture,” Annette explains, stepping in on Manfred’s behalf.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nobody else in the discussion space seems to notice that Rita and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan are busy ripping the shit out of each other over a private</p>
<p class="calibre1">channel, throwing emotional hand grenades back and forth like seasoned</p>
<p class="calibre1">divorcees. “It’s not a satisfactory solution to the evacuation</p>
<p class="calibre1">question, but it ought to satisfy the conservatives’ baseline</p>
<p class="calibre1">requirement, and as insurance -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“- That’s right, blame your eigenmother! Has it occurred to you that</p>
<p class="calibre1">she doesn’t care enough about you to try a stunt like that? I think</p>
<p class="calibre1">you spent too much time with that crazy grandmother of yours. You</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn’t even integrate that ghost, did you? Too afraid of polluting</p>
<p class="calibre1">yourself! I bet you never even bothered to check what it felt like</p>
<p class="calibre1">from inside -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“- I did -” Sirhan freezes for a moment, personality modules paging in</p>
<p class="calibre1">and out of his brain like a swarm of angry bees - “make a fool of</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself,” he adds quietly, then slumps back in his seat. “This is so</p>
<p class="calibre1">embarrassing …” He covers his face with his hands. “You’re right.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I am?” Rita’s puzzlement slowly gives way to understanding; Sirhan</p>
<p class="calibre1">has finally integrated the memories from the partials they hybridized</p>
<p class="calibre1">earlier. Stuck-up and proud, the cognitive dissonance must be</p>
<p class="calibre1">enormous. “No, I’m not. You’re just overly defensive.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m -” Embarrassed. Because Rita knows him, inside out. Has the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ghost-memories of six months in a simspace with him, playing with</p>
<p class="calibre1">ideas, exchanging intimacies, later confidences. She holds</p>
<p class="calibre1">ghost-memories of his embrace, a smoky affair that might have happened</p>
<p class="calibre1">in real space if his instant reaction to realizing that it could</p>
<p class="calibre1">happen hadn’t been to dump the splinter of his mind that was</p>
<p class="calibre1">contaminated by impure thoughts to cold storage and deny everything.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We have no threat profile yet,” Annette says, cutting right across</p>
<p class="calibre1">their private conversation. “If there is a direct threat - and we</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t know that for sure, yet, the Vile Offspring might be enlightened</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough simply to be leaving us alone - it’ll probably be some kind of</p>
<p class="calibre1">subtle attack aimed directly at the foundations of our identity. Look</p>
<p class="calibre1">for a credit bubble, distributed trust metrics devaluing suddenly as</p>
<p class="calibre1">people catch some kind of weird religion, something like that. Maybe a</p>
<p class="calibre1">perverse election outcome. And it won’t be sudden. They are not</p>
<p class="calibre1">stupid, to start a headlong attack without slow corruption to soften</p>
<p class="calibre1">the way.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve obviously been thinking about this for some time,” Sameena</p>
<p class="calibre1">says with dry emphasis. “What’s in it for your friend, uh, Blue? Did</p>
<p class="calibre1">you squirrel away enough credit to cover the price of renting a</p>
<p class="calibre1">starship from the Economics 2.0 metabubble? Or is there something you</p>
<p class="calibre1">aren’t telling us?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um.” Manfred looks like a small boy with his hand caught in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sweets jar. “Well, as a matter of fact -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, Dad, why don’t you tell us just what this is going to cost?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber asks.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, well.” He looks embarrassed. “It’s the lobsters, not Aineko. They</p>
<p class="calibre1">want some payment.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rita reaches out and grabs Sirhan’s hand: He doesn’t resist. “Do you</p>
<p class="calibre1">know about this?” Rita queries him.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All new to me …” A confused partial thread follows his reply down</p>
<p class="calibre1">the pipe, and for a while, she joins him in introspective reverie,</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying to work out the implications of knowing what they know about</p>
<p class="calibre1">the possibility of a mutual relationship.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They want a written conceptual map. A map of all the accessible meme</p>
<p class="calibre1">spaces hanging off the router network, compiled by human explorers who</p>
<p class="calibre1">they can use as a baseline, they say. It’s quite simple - in return</p>
<p class="calibre1">for a ticket out-system, some of us are going to have to go exploring.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But that doesn’t mean we can’t leave backups behind.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do they have any particular explorers in mind?” Amber sniffs.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,” says Manfred. “Just a team of us, to map out the router network</p>
<p class="calibre1">and ensure they get some warning of threats from outside.” He pauses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re going to want to come along, aren’t you?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pre-election campaign takes approximately three minutes and</p>
<p class="calibre1">consumes more bandwidth than the sum of all terrestrial communications</p>
<p class="calibre1">channels from prehistory to 2008. Approximately six million ghosts of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amber, individually tailored to fit the profile of the targeted</p>
<p class="calibre1">audience, fork across the dark fiber meshwork underpinning of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lily-pad colonies, then out through ultrawideband mesh networks,</p>
<p class="calibre1">instantiated in implants and floating dust motes to buttonhole the</p>
<p class="calibre1">voters. Many of them fail to reach their audience, and many more hold</p>
<p class="calibre1">fruitless discussions; about six actually decide they’ve diverged so</p>
<p class="calibre1">far from their original that they constitute separate people and</p>
<p class="calibre1">register for independent citizenship, two defect to the other side,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and one elopes with a swarm of highly empathic modified African</p>
<p class="calibre1">honeybees.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ambers are not the only ghosts competing for attention in the public</p>
<p class="calibre1">zeitgeist. In fact, they’re in a minority. Most of the autonomous</p>
<p class="calibre1">electoral agents are campaigning for a variety of platforms that range</p>
<p class="calibre1">from introducing a progressive income tax - nobody is quite sure why,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but it seems to be traditional - to a motion calling for the entire</p>
<p class="calibre1">planet to be paved, which quite ignores the realities of element</p>
<p class="calibre1">abundance in the upper atmosphere of a metal-poor gas giant, not to</p>
<p class="calibre1">mention playing hell with the weather. The Faceless are campaigning</p>
<p class="calibre1">for everyone to be assigned a new set of facial muscles every six</p>
<p class="calibre1">months, the Livid Pranksters are demanding equal rights for</p>
<p class="calibre1">subsentient entities, and a host of single-issue pressure groups are</p>
<p class="calibre1">yammering about the usual lost causes.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just how the election process anneals is a black mystery - at least,</p>
<p class="calibre1">to those people who aren’t party to the workings of the Festival</p>
<p class="calibre1">Committee, the group who first had the idea of paving Saturn with</p>
<p class="calibre1">hot-hydrogen balloons - but over the course of a complete diurn,</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost forty thousand seconds, a pattern begins to emerge. This</p>
<p class="calibre1">pattern will systematize the bias of the communications networks that</p>
<p class="calibre1">traffic in reputation points across the planetary polity for a long</p>
<p class="calibre1">time - possibly as much as fifty million seconds, getting on for a</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole Martian year (if Mars still existed). It will create a</p>
<p class="calibre1">parliament - a merged group mind borganism that speaks as one</p>
<p class="calibre1">supermind built from the beliefs of the victors. And the news isn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">great, as the party gathered in the upper sphere of the Atomium (which</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred insisted Amber rent for the dead dog party) is slowly</p>
<p class="calibre1">realizing. Amber isn’t there, presumably drowning her sorrows or</p>
<p class="calibre1">engaging in postelection schemes of a different nature somewhere else.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But other members of her team are about.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It could be worse,” Rita rationalizes, late in the evening. She’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">sitting in a corner of the seventh-floor deck, in a 1950s wireframe</p>
<p class="calibre1">chair, clutching a glass of synthetic single malt and watching the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shadows. “We could be in an old-style contested election with seven</p>
<p class="calibre1">shades of shit flying. At least this way we can be decently</p>
<p class="calibre1">anonymous.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the blind spots detaches from her peripheral vision and</p>
<p class="calibre1">approaches. It segues into view, suddenly congealing into Sirhan. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">looks morose.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s your problem?” she demands. “Your former faction is winning on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the count.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe so.” He sits down beside her, carefully avoiding her gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe this is a good thing. And maybe not.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So when are you going to join the syncitium?” she asks.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me? Join that?” He looks alarmed. “You think I want to become part of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a parliamentary borg? What do you take me for?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh.” She shakes her head. “I assumed you were avoiding me because -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” He holds out his hand, and a passing waitron deposits a glass in</p>
<p class="calibre1">it. He takes a deep breath. “I owe you an apology.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">About time, she thinks, uncharitably. But he’s like that. Stiff-necked</p>
<p class="calibre1">and proud, slow to acknowledge a mistake, but unlikely to apologize</p>
<p class="calibre1">unless he really means it. “What for?” she asks.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For not giving you the benefit of the doubt,” he says slowly, rolling</p>
<p class="calibre1">the glass between his palms. “I should have listened to myself earlier</p>
<p class="calibre1">instead of locking him out of me.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The self he’s talking about seems self-evident to her. “You’re not an</p>
<p class="calibre1">easy man to get close to,” she says quietly. “Maybe that’s part of</p>
<p class="calibre1">your problem.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Part of it?” He chuckles bitterly. “My mother -” He bites back</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatever he originally meant to say. “Do you know I’m older than she</p>
<p class="calibre1">is? Than this version, I mean. She gets up my nose with her</p>
<p class="calibre1">assumptions about me …”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They run both ways.” Rita reaches out and takes his hand - and he</p>
<p class="calibre1">grips her right back, no rejection this time. “Listen, it looks as if</p>
<p class="calibre1">she’s not going to make it into the parliament of lies. There’s a</p>
<p class="calibre1">straight conservative sweep, these folks are in solid denial. About</p>
<p class="calibre1">eighty percent of the population are resimulants or old-timers from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Earth, and that’s not going to change before the Vile Offspring turn</p>
<p class="calibre1">on us. What are we going to do?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He shrugs. “I suspect everyone who thinks we’re really under threat</p>
<p class="calibre1">will move on. You know this is going to destroy the accelerationistas</p>
<p class="calibre1">trust in democracy? They’ve still got a viable plan - Manfred’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">friendly lobster will work without the need for an entire planet’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">energy budget - but the rejection is going to hurt. I can’t help</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking that maybe the real goal of the Vile Offspring was simply to</p>
<p class="calibre1">gerrymander us into not diverting resources away from them. It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">blunt, it’s unsubtle, so we assumed that wasn’t the point. But maybe</p>
<p class="calibre1">there’s a time for them to be blunt.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She shrugs. “Democracy is a bad fit for lifeboats.” But she’s still</p>
<p class="calibre1">uncomfortable with the idea. “And think of all the people we’ll be</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaving behind.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well.” He smiles tightly. “If you can think of any way to encourage</p>
<p class="calibre1">the masses to join us …”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A good start would be to stop thinking of them as masses to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">manipulated.” Rita stares at him. “Your family appears to have been</p>
<p class="calibre1">developing a hereditary elitist streak, and it’s not attractive.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan looks uncomfortable. “If you think I’m bad, you should talk to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko about it,” he says, self-deprecatingly. “Sometimes I wonder</p>
<p class="calibre1">about that cat.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe I will.” She pauses. “And you? What are you going to do with</p>
<p class="calibre1">yourself? Are you going to join the explorers?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I -” He looks sideways at her. “I can see myself sending an</p>
<p class="calibre1">eigenbrother,” he says quietly. “But I’m not going to gamble my entire</p>
<p class="calibre1">future on a bid to reach the far side of the observable universe by</p>
<p class="calibre1">router. I’ve had enough excitement to last me a lifetime, lately. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">think one copy for the backup archive in the icy depths, one to go</p>
<p class="calibre1">exploring - and one to settle down and raise a family. What about</p>
<p class="calibre1">you?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll go all three ways?” she asks.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I think so. What about you?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where you go, I go.” She leans against him. “Isn’t that what matters</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the end?” she murmurs.</p>
