<h2 id="calibre_toc_16" class="calibre3">Chapter 9: Survivor</h2><p class="calibre1">This time, more than a double handful of years passes between</p>
<p class="calibre1">successive visits to the Macx dynasty.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somewhere in the gas-sprinkled darkness beyond the local void,</p>
<p class="calibre1">carbon-based life stirs. A cylinder of diamond fifty kilometers long</p>
<p class="calibre1">spins in the darkness, its surface etched with strange quantum wells</p>
<p class="calibre1">that emulate exotic atoms not found in any periodic table that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Mendeleyev would have recognized. Within it, walls hold kilotonnes of</p>
<p class="calibre1">oxygen and nitrogen gas, megatonnes of life-infested soil. A hundred</p>
<p class="calibre1">trillion kilometers from the wreckage of Earth, the cylinder glitters</p>
<p class="calibre1">like a gem in the darkness.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Welcome to New Japan: one of the places between the stars where human</p>
<p class="calibre1">beings hang out, now that the solar system is off-limits to</p>
<p class="calibre1">meatbodies.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I wonder who we’ll find here?</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s an open plaza in one of the terraform sectors of the habitat</p>
<p class="calibre1">cylinder. A huge gong hangs from a beautifully painted wooden frame at</p>
<p class="calibre1">one side of the square, which is paved with weathered limestone slabs</p>
<p class="calibre1">made of atoms ripped from a planet that has never seen molten ice.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Houses stand around, and open-fronted huts where a variety of humanoid</p>
<p class="calibre1">waitrons attend to food and beverages for the passing realfolk. A</p>
<p class="calibre1">group of prepubescent children are playing hunt-and-seek with their</p>
<p class="calibre1">big-eyed pet companions, brandishing makeshift spears and automatic</p>
<p class="calibre1">rifles - there’s no pain here, for bodies are fungible, rebuilt in a</p>
<p class="calibre1">minute by the assembler/disassembler gates in every room. There are</p>
<p class="calibre1">few adults hereabouts, for Red Plaza is unfashionable at present, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the kids have claimed it for their own as a playground. They’re all</p>
<p class="calibre1">genuinely young, symptoms of a demographic demiurge, not a single</p>
<p class="calibre1">wendypan among them.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">A skinny boy with nut brown skin, a mop of black hair, and three arms</p>
<p class="calibre1">is patiently stalking a worried-looking blue eeyore around the corner</p>
<p class="calibre1">of the square. He’s passing a stand stacked with fresh sushi rolls</p>
<p class="calibre1">when the strange beast squirms out from beneath a wheelbarrow and</p>
<p class="calibre1">arches its back, stretching luxuriously.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The boy, Manni, freezes, hands tensing around his spear as he focuses</p>
<p class="calibre1">on the new target. (The blue eeyore flicks its tail at him and darts</p>
<p class="calibre1">for safety across a lichen-encrusted slab.) “City, what’s that?” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">asks without moving his lips.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What are you looking at?” replies City, which puzzles him somewhat,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but not as much as it should.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The beast finishes stretching one front leg and extends another. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">looks a bit like a pussycat to Manni, but there’s something subtly</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrong with it. Its head is a little too small, the eyes likewise - and</p>
<p class="calibre1">those paws - “You’re sharp,” he accuses the beast, forehead wrinkling</p>
<p class="calibre1">in disapproval.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, whatever.” The creature yawns, and Manni points his spear at</p>
<p class="calibre1">it, clenching the shaft in both right hands. It’s got sharp teeth,</p>
<p class="calibre1">too, but it spoke to him via his inner hearing, not his ears.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Innerspeech is for people, not toys.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who are you?” he demands.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The beast looks at him insolently. “I know your parents,” it says,</p>
<p class="calibre1">still using innerspeech. “You’re Manni Macx, aren’t you? Thought so. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">want you to take me to your father.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!” Manni jumps up and waves his arms at it. “I don’t like you! Go</p>
<p class="calibre1">away!” He pokes his spear in the direction of the beast’s nose.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll go away when you take me to your father,” says the beast. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">raises its tail like a pussycat, and the fur bushes out, but then it</p>
<p class="calibre1">pauses. “If you take me to your father I’ll tell you a story</p>
<p class="calibre1">afterward, how about that?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t care!” Manni is only about two hundred megaseconds old - seven</p>
<p class="calibre1">old Earth-years - but he can tell when he’s being manipulated and gets</p>
<p class="calibre1">truculent.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kids.” The cat-thing’s tail lashes from side to side. “Okay, Manni,</p>
<p class="calibre1">how about you take me to your father, or I rip your face off? I’ve got</p>
<p class="calibre1">claws, you know.” A brief eyeblink later, it’s wrapping itself around</p>
<p class="calibre1">his ankles sinuously, purring to give the lie to its unreliable threat</p>
<p class="calibre1">- but he can see that it’s got sharp nails all right. It’s a wild</p>
<p class="calibre1">pussycat-thing, and nothing in his artificially preserved orthohuman</p>
<p class="calibre1">upbringing has prepared him for dealing with a real wild</p>
<p class="calibre1">pussycat-thing that talks.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get away!” Manni is worried. “Mom!” he hollers, unintentionally</p>
<p class="calibre1">triggering the broadcast flag in his innerspeech. “There’s this thing</p>
<p class="calibre1">-”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mom will do.” The cat-thing sounds resigned. It stops rubbing against</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manni’s legs and looks up at him. “There’s no need to panic. I won’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">hurt you.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manni stops hollering. “Who’re you?” he asks at last, staring at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">beast. Somewhere light-years away, an adult has heard his cry; his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother is coming fast, bouncing between switches and glancing off</p>
<p class="calibre1">folded dimensions in a headlong rush toward him.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m Aineko.” The beast sits down and begins to wash behind one hind</p>
<p class="calibre1">leg. “And you’re Manni, right?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aineko,” Manni says uncertainly. “Do you know Lis or Bill?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko the cat-thing pauses in his washing routine and looks at Manni,</p>
<p class="calibre1">head cocked to one side. Manni is too young, too inexperienced to know</p>
<p class="calibre1">that Aineko’s proportions are those of a domestic cat, Felis catus, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">naturally evolved animal rather than the toys and palimpsests and</p>
<p class="calibre1">companionables he’s used to. Reality may be fashionable with his</p>
<p class="calibre1">parents’ generation, but there are limits, after all. Orange-and-brown</p>
<p class="calibre1">stripes and whorls decorate Aineko’s fur, and he sprouts a white</p>
<p class="calibre1">fluffy bib beneath his chin. “Who are Lis and Bill?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Them,” says Manni, as big, sullen-faced Bill creeps up behind Aineko</p>
<p class="calibre1">and tries to grab his tail while Lis floats behind his shoulder like a</p>
<p class="calibre1">pint-sized UFO, buzzing excitedly. But Aineko is too fast for the kids</p>
<p class="calibre1">and scampers round Manni’s feet like a hairy missile. Manni whoops and</p>
<p class="calibre1">tries to spear the pussycat-thing, but his spear turns to blue glass,</p>
<p class="calibre1">crackles, and shards of brilliant snow rain down, burning his hands.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now that wasn’t very friendly, was it?” says Aineko, a menacing note</p>
<p class="calibre1">in his voice. “Didn’t your mother teach you not to -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The door in the side of the sushi stall opens as Rita arrives,</p>
<p class="calibre1">breathless and angry: “Manni! What have I told you about playing -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She stops, seeing Aineko. “You.” She recoils in barely concealed</p>
<p class="calibre1">fright. Unlike Manni, she recognizes it as the avatar of a posthuman</p>
<p class="calibre1">demiurge, a body incarnated solely to provide a point of personal</p>
<p class="calibre1">interaction for people to focus on.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat grins back at her. “Me,” he agrees. “Ready to talk?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looks stricken. “We’ve got nothing to talk about.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko lashes his tail. “Oh, but we do.” The cat turns and looks</p>
<p class="calibre1">pointedly at Manni. “Don’t we?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">It has been a long time since Aineko passed this way, and in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">meantime the space around Hyundai +4904/[-56] has changed out of</p>
<p class="calibre1">all recognition. Back when the great lobster-built starships swept</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of Sol’s Oort cloud, archiving the raw frozen data of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">unoccupied brown dwarf halo systems and seeding their structured</p>
<p class="calibre1">excrement with programmable matter, there was nothing but random</p>
<p class="calibre1">dead atoms hereabouts (and an alien router). But that was a long</p>
<p class="calibre1">time ago; and since then, the brown dwarf system has succumbed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">an anthropic infestation.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">An unoptimized instance of H. sapiens maintains state coherency for</p>
<p class="calibre1">only two to three gigaseconds before it succumbs to necrosis. But</p>
<p class="calibre1">in only about ten gigaseconds, the infestation has turned the dead</p>
<p class="calibre1">brown dwarf system upside down. They strip-mined the chilly planets</p>
<p class="calibre1">to make environments suitable for their own variety of carbon life.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They rearranged moons, building massive structures the size of</p>
<p class="calibre1">asteroids. They ripped wormhole endpoints free of the routers and</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned them into their own crude point-to-point network, learned</p>
<p class="calibre1">how to generate new wormholes, then ran their own packet-switched</p>
<p class="calibre1">polities over them. Wormhole traffic now supports an ever-expanding</p>
<p class="calibre1">mesh of interstellar human commerce, but always in the darkness</p>
<p class="calibre1">between the lit stars and the strange, metal-depleted dwarfs with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the suspiciously low-entropy radiation. The sheer temerity of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">project is mind-boggling: notwithstanding that canned apes are</p>
<p class="calibre1">simply not suited to life in the interstellar void, especially in</p>
<p class="calibre1">orbit around a brown dwarf whose planets make Pluto seem like a</p>
<p class="calibre1">tropical paradise, they’ve taken over the whole damn system.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">New Japan is one of the newer human polities in this system, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bunch of nodes physically collocated in the humaniformed spaces of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the colony cylinders. Its designers evidently only knew about old</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nippon from recordings made back before Earth was dismantled, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">worked from a combination of nostalgia-trip videos, Miyazaki</p>
<p class="calibre1">movies, and anime culture. Nevertheless, it’s the home of numerous</p>
<p class="calibre1">human beings - even if they are about as similar to their</p>
<p class="calibre1">historical antecedents as New Japan is to its long-gone namesake.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Humanity?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their grandparents would recognize them, mostly. The ones who are</p>
<p class="calibre1">truly beyond the ken of twentieth-century survivors stayed back</p>
<p class="calibre1">home in the red-hot clouds of nanocomputers that have replaced the</p>
<p class="calibre1">planets that once orbited Earth’s sun in stately Copernican</p>
<p class="calibre1">harmony. The fast-thinking Matrioshka brains are as</p>
<p class="calibre1">incomprehensible to their merely posthuman ancestors as an ICBM to</p>
<p class="calibre1">an amoeba - and about as inhabitable. Space is dusted with the</p>
<p class="calibre1">corpses of Matrioshka brains that have long since burned out,</p>
<p class="calibre1">informational collapse taking down entire civilizations that stayed</p>
<p class="calibre1">in close orbit around their home stars. Farther away, galaxy-sized</p>
<p class="calibre1">intelligences beat incomprehensible rhythms against the darkness of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the vacuum, trying to hack the Planck substrate into doing their</p>
<p class="calibre1">bidding. Posthumans, and the few other semitranscended species to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have discovered the router network, live furtively in the darkness</p>
<p class="calibre1">between these islands of brilliance. There are, it would seem,</p>
<p class="calibre1">advantages to not being too intelligent.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Humanity. Monadic intelligences, mostly trapped within their own</p>
<p class="calibre1">skulls, living in small family groups within larger tribal</p>
<p class="calibre1">networks, adaptable to territorial or migratory lifestyles. Those</p>
<p class="calibre1">were the options on offer before the great acceleration. Now that</p>
<p class="calibre1">dumb matter thinks, with every kilogram of wallpaper potentially</p>
<p class="calibre1">hosting hundreds of uploaded ancestors, now that every door is</p>
<p class="calibre1">potentially a wormhole to a hab half a parsec away, the humans can</p>
<p class="calibre1">stay in the same place while the landscape migrates and mutates</p>
<p class="calibre1">past them, streaming into the luxurious void of their personal</p>
<p class="calibre1">history. Life is rich here, endlessly varied and sometimes</p>
<p class="calibre1">confusing. So it is that tribal groups remain, their associations</p>
<p class="calibre1">mediated across teraklicks and gigaseconds by exotic agencies. And</p>
<p class="calibre1">sometimes the agencies will vanish for a while, reappearing later</p>
<p class="calibre1">like an unexpected jape upon the infinite.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ancestor worship takes on a whole new meaning when the state vectors</p>
<p class="calibre1">of all the filial entities’ precursors are archived and indexed for</p>
<p class="calibre1">recall. At just the moment that the tiny capillaries in Rita’s face</p>
<p class="calibre1">are constricting in response to a surge of adrenaline, causing her to</p>
<p class="calibre1">turn pale and her pupils to dilate as she focuses on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pussycat-thing, Sirhan is kneeling before a small shrine, lighting a</p>
<p class="calibre1">stick of incense, and preparing to respectfully address his</p>
<p class="calibre1">grandfather’s ghost.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ritual is, strictly speaking, unnecessary. Sirhan can speak to his</p>
<p class="calibre1">grandfather’s ghost wherever and whenever he wants, without any</p>
<p class="calibre1">formality, and the ghost will reply at interminable length, cracking</p>
<p class="calibre1">puns in dead languages and asking about people who died before the</p>
<p class="calibre1">temple of history was established. But Sirhan is a sucker for rituals,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and anyway, it helps him structure an otherwise-stressful encounter.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">If it were up to Sirhan, he’d probably skip chatting to grandfather</p>
<p class="calibre1">every ten megaseconds. Sirhan’s mother and her partner aren’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">available, having opted to join one of the long-distance exploration</p>
<p class="calibre1">missions through the router network that were launched by the</p>
<p class="calibre1">accelerationistas long ago; and Rita’s antecedents are either fully</p>
<p class="calibre1">virtualized or dead. They are a family with a tenuous grip on history.</p>
<p class="calibre1">But both of them spent a long time in the same state of half-life in</p>
<p class="calibre1">which Manfred currently exists, and he knows his wife will take him to</p>
<p class="calibre1">task if he doesn’t bring the revered ancestor up to date on what’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">been happening in the real world while he’s been dead. In Manfred’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">case, death is not only potentially reversible, but almost inevitably</p>
<p class="calibre1">so. After all, they’re raising his clone. Sooner or later, the kid is</p>
<p class="calibre1">going to want to visit the original, or vice versa.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">What a state we have come to, when the restless dead refuse to stay a</p>
<p class="calibre1">part of history? He wonders ironically as he scratches the</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-igniter strip on the red incense stick and bows to the mirror at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the back of the shrine. “Your respectful grandson awaits and expects</p>
<p class="calibre1">your guidance,” he intones formally - for in addition to being</p>
<p class="calibre1">conservative by nature, Sirhan is acutely aware of his family’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">relative poverty and the need to augment their social credit, and in</p>
<p class="calibre1">this reincarnation-intermediated traditionalist polity for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hopelessly orthohuman, you can score credit for formality. He sits</p>
<p class="calibre1">back on his heels to await the response.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred doesn’t take long to appear in the depths of the mirror. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">takes the shape of an albino orangutan, as usual: He was messing</p>
<p class="calibre1">around with Great Aunt Annette’s ontological wardrobe right before</p>
<p class="calibre1">this copy of him was recorded and placed in the temple - they might</p>
<p class="calibre1">have separated, but they remained close. “Hi, lad. What year is it?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan suppresses a sigh. “We don’t do years anymore,” he explains,</p>
<p class="calibre1">not for the first time. Every time he consults his grandfather, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">new instance asks this question sooner or later. “Years are an</p>
<p class="calibre1">archaism. It’s been ten megs since we last spoke - about four months,</p>
<p class="calibre1">if you’re going to be pedantic about it, and a hundred and eighty</p>
<p class="calibre1">years since we emigrated. Although correcting for general relativity</p>
<p class="calibre1">adds another decade or so.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh. Is that all?” Manfred manages to look disappointed. This is a new</p>
<p class="calibre1">one on Sirhan: Usually the diverging state vector of Gramps’s ghost</p>
<p class="calibre1">asks after Amber or cracks a feeble joke at this point. “No changes in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the Hubble constant, or the rate of stellar formation? Have we heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">from any of the exploration eigenselves yet?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope.” Sirhan relaxes slightly. So Manfred is going to ask about the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fool’s errand to the edge of the Beckenstein limit again, is he?</p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s canned conversation number twenty-nine. (Amber and the other</p>
<p class="calibre1">explorers who set out for the really long exploration mission shortly</p>
<p class="calibre1">after the first colony was settled aren’t due back for, oh, about 1019</p>
<p class="calibre1">seconds. It’s a long way to the edge of the observable universe, even</p>
<p class="calibre1">when you can go the first several hundred million light-years - to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">B�otes supercluster and beyond - via a small-world network of</p>
<p class="calibre1">wormholes. And this time, she didn’t leave any copies of herself</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind.)</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan - either in this or some other incarnation - has had this talk</p>
<p class="calibre1">with Manfred many times before, because that’s the essence of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dead. They don’t remember from one recall session to the next, unless</p>
<p class="calibre1">and until they ask to be resurrected because their restoration</p>
<p class="calibre1">criteria have been matched. Manfred has been dead a long time, long</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough for Sirhan and Rita to be resurrected and live a long family</p>
<p class="calibre1">life three or four times over after they had spent a century or so in</p>
<p class="calibre1">nonexistence. “We’ve received no notices from the lobsters, nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">from Aineko either.” He takes a deep breath. “You always ask me where</p>
<p class="calibre1">we are next, so I’ve got a canned response for you -” and one of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">agents throws the package, tagged as a scroll sealed with red wax and</p>
<p class="calibre1">a silk ribbon, through the surface of the mirror. (After the tenth</p>
<p class="calibre1">repetition Rita and Sirhan agreed to write a basic briefing that the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred-ghosts could use to orient themselves.)</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred is silent for a moment - probably hours in ghost-space - as he</p>
<p class="calibre1">assimilates the changes. Then: “This is true? I’ve slept through a</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole civilization?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not slept, you’ve been dead,” Sirhan says pedantically. He realizes</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’s being a bit harsh: “Actually, so did we,” he adds. “We surfed the</p>
<p class="calibre1">first three gigasecs or so because we wanted to start a family</p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhere where our children could grow up the traditional way. Habs</p>
<p class="calibre1">with an oxidation-intensive triple-point water environment didn’t get</p>
<p class="calibre1">built until sometime after the beginning of the exile. That’s when the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fad for neomorphism got entrenched,” he adds with distaste. For quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">a while the neos resisted the idea of wasting resources building</p>

<p class="calibre1">the orthodox to reincarnate from death-sleep after a few decades, once</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Uh.” Manfred takes a deep breath, then scratches himself under one</p>
<p class="calibre1">armpit, rubbery lips puckering. “So, let me get this straight: We -</p>
<p class="calibre1">you, they, whoever - hit the router at Hyundai +4904/[-56], replicated</p>
<p class="calibre1">a load of them, and now use the wormhole mechanism the routers rely on</p>
<p class="calibre1">as point-to-point gates for physical transport? And have spread</p>
<p class="calibre1">throughout a bunch of brown dwarf systems, and built a pure deep-space</p>
<p class="calibre1">polity based on big cylinder habitats connected by teleport gates</p>
<p class="calibre1">hacked out of routers?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would you trust one of the original routers for switched data</p>
<p class="calibre1">communications?” Sirhan asks rhetorically. “Even with the source code?</p>
<p class="calibre1">They’ve been corrupted by all the dead alien Matrioshka civilizations</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’ve come into contact with, but they’re reasonably safe if all you</p>
<p class="calibre1">want to use them for is to cannibalize them for wormholes and tunnel</p>
<p class="calibre1">dumb mass from point to point.” He searches for a metaphor: “Like</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“O-kay.” Manfred looks thoughtful, as he usually does at this point in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the conversation - which means Sirhan is going to have to break it to</p>
<p class="calibre1">him that his first thoughts for how to utilize the gates have already</p>
<p class="calibre1">been done. They’re hopelessly old hat. In fact, the main reason why</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred is still dead is that things have moved on so far that, sooner</p>
<p class="calibre1">or later, whenever he surfaces for a chat, he gets frustrated and</p>
<p class="calibre1">elects not to be reincarnated. Not that Sirhan is about to tell him</p>
<p class="calibre1">that he’s obsolete - that would be rude, not to say subtly inaccurate.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“That raises some interesting possibilities. I wonder, has anyone -”</p>

<p class="calibre1">awareness like a scalpel, distracting him from the ghost of his</p>

<p class="calibre1">attention to Rita without sparing Manfred even a ghost.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s happening -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He sees through Rita’s eyes: a cat with an orange-and-brown swirl on</p>
<p class="calibre1">its flank sits purring beside Manni in the family room of their</p>
<p class="calibre1">dwelling. Its eyes are narrowed as it watches her with unnatural</p>
<p class="calibre1">wisdom. Manni is running fingers through its fur and seems none the</p>
<p class="calibre1">worse for wear, but Sirhan still feels his fists clench.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse me,” he says, standing up: “Got to go. Your bloody cat’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned up.” He adds “coming home now” for Rita’s benefit, then turns</p>
<p class="calibre1">and hurries out of the temple concourse. When he reaches the main</p>
<p class="calibre1">hall, he pauses, then Rita’s sense of urgency returns to him, and he</p>
<p class="calibre1">throws parsimony to the wind, stepping into a priority gate in order</p>
<p class="calibre1">to get home as fast as possible.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind him, Manfred’s melancholy ghost snorts, mildly offended, and</p>

<p class="calibre1">public space modeled on a Menger sponge - a cube diced subtractively</p>

<p class="calibre1">infinity. This being meatspace, or a reasonable simulation thereof, it</p>

<p class="calibre1">down at least four levels.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He pauses behind a waist-high diamond barrier and looks down into the</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost-tesseract-shaped depths of the cube’s interior, at a verdant</p>
<p class="calibre1">garden landscape with charming footbridges that cross streams laid out</p>
<p class="calibre1">with careful attention to the requirements of feng shui. He looks up:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some of the cube-shaped subtractive openings within the pseudofractal</p>
<p class="calibre1">structure are occupied by windows belonging to dwellings or shared</p>
<p class="calibre1">buildings that overlook the public space. High above, butterfly-shaped</p>
<p class="calibre1">beings with exotic colored wings circle in the ventilation currents.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s hard to tell from down here, but the central cuboid opening looks</p>
<p class="calibre1">to be at least half a kilometer on a side, and they might very well be</p>
<p class="calibre1">posthumans with low-gee wings - angels.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Angels, or rats in the walls? he asks himself, and sighs. Half his</p>
<p class="calibre1">extensions are off-line, so hopelessly obsolete that the temple’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">assembler systems didn’t bother replicating them, or even creating</p>
<p class="calibre1">emulation environments for them to run in. The rest … well, at least</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’s still physically orthohuman, he realizes. Fully functional, fully</p>
<p class="calibre1">male. Not everything has changed - only the important stuff. It’s a</p>
<p class="calibre1">scary-funny thought, laden with irony. Here he is, naked as the day he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was born - newly re-created, in fact, released from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wake-experience-reset cycle of the temple of history - standing on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">threshold of a posthuman civilization so outrageously rich and</p>
<p class="calibre1">powerful that they can build mammal-friendly habitats that resemble</p>
<p class="calibre1">works of art in the cryogenic depths of space. Only he’s poor, this</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole polity is poor, and it can’t ever be anything else, in fact,</p>
<p class="calibre1">because it’s a dumping ground for merely posthuman also-rans, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">singularitarian equivalent of australopithecines. In the brave new</p>
<p class="calibre1">world of the Vile Offspring, they can’t get ahead any more than a</p>
<p class="calibre1">protohominid could hack it as a rocket scientist in Werner von Braun’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">day. They’re born to be primitive, wallowing happily in the mud-bath</p>
<p class="calibre1">of their own limited cognitive bandwidth. So they fled into the</p>
<p class="calibre1">darkness and built a civilization so bright it can put anything</p>
<p class="calibre1">earthbound that came before the singularity into the shade … and</p>
<p class="calibre1">it’s still a shanty town inhabited by the mentally handicapped.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The incongruity of it amuses him, but only for a moment. He has, after</p>
<p class="calibre1">all, electively reincarnated for a reason: Sirhan’s throwaway comment</p>
<p class="calibre1">about the cat caught his attention. “City, where can I find some</p>
<p class="calibre1">clothes?” he asks. “Something socially appropriate, that is. And some,</p>
<p class="calibre1">uh, brains. I need to be able to off-load …”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Citymind chuckles inside the back of his head, and Manfred realizes</p>
<p class="calibre1">that there’s a public assembler on the other side of the ornamental</p>
<p class="calibre1">wall he’s leaning on. “Oh,” he mutters, as he finds himself imagining</p>
<p class="calibre1">something not unlike his clunky old direct neural interface,</p>
<p class="calibre1">candy-colored icons and overlays and all. It’s curiously mutable, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">with a weird sense of detachment, he realizes that it’s not his</p>
<p class="calibre1">imagination at all, but an infinitely customizable interface to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pervasive information spaces of the polity, currently running in</p>
<p class="calibre1">dumbed-down stupid mode for his benefit. It’s true; he needs training</p>
<p class="calibre1">wheels. But it doesn’t take him long to figure out how to ask the</p>
<p class="calibre1">assembler to make him a pair of pants and a plain black vest, and to</p>
<p class="calibre1">discover that, as long as he keeps his requests simple, the results</p>
<p class="calibre1">are free - just like back home on Saturn. The spaceborn polities are</p>
<p class="calibre1">kind to indigents, for the basic requirements of life are cheap, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">to withhold them would be tantamount to homicide. (If the presence of</p>
<p class="calibre1">transhumans has upset a whole raft of prior assumptions, at least it</p>
<p class="calibre1">hasn’t done more than superficial damage to the Golden Rule.)</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clothed and more or less conscious - at least at a human level -</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred takes stock. “Where do Sirhan and Rita live?” he asks. A</p>
<p class="calibre1">dotted route makes itself apparent to him, snaking improbably through</p>
<p class="calibre1">a solid wall that he understands to be an instantaneous wormhole gate</p>
<p class="calibre1">connecting points light-years apart. He shakes his head, bemused. I</p>
<p class="calibre1">suppose I’d better go and see them, he decides. It’s not as if there’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">anyone else for him to look up, is it? The Franklins vanished into the</p>
<p class="calibre1">solar Matrioshka brain, Pamela died ages ago (and there’s a shame,</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’d never expected to miss her) and Annette hooked up with Gianni</p>
<p class="calibre1">while he was being a flock of pigeons. (Draw a line under that one and</p>
<p class="calibre1">say it’s all over.) His daughter vanished into the long-range</p>
<p class="calibre1">exploration program. He’s been dead for so long that his friends and</p>
<p class="calibre1">acquaintances are scattered across a light cone centuries across. He</p>
<p class="calibre1">can’t think of anyone else here who he might run into, except for the</p>
<p class="calibre1">loyal grandson, keeping the candle of filial piety burning with</p>
<p class="calibre1">unasked-for zeal. “Maybe he needs help,” Manfred thinks aloud as he</p>
<p class="calibre1">steps into the gate, rationalizing. “And then again, maybe he can help</p>

<p class="calibre1">long-ago warnings about the cat sank in deeply, because she’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">certainly not treating it as the small bundle of child-friendly fun it</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Trouble?” The cat looks up at her sardonically, lashing his tail from</p>

<p class="calibre1">The door chime clears its throat, to announce a visitor: “Ren Fuller</p>

<p class="calibre1">in an unreasonable world, simulating outcomes, living through bad</p>
<p class="calibre1">dreams, and backtracking to adjust her responses accordingly. “Show</p>

<p class="calibre1">hundred and eighth floor of the North Tower. In historical reality,</p>
<p class="calibre1">the one hundred and eighth floor was occupied by corporate offices;</p>
<p class="calibre1">but the mindspace is a consensual fiction, and it is Manni’s conceit</p>
<p class="calibre1">to live at this pivotal point. (Not that it means much to him - he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">born well over a century after the War on Terror - but it’s part of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his childhood folklore, the fall of the Two Towers that shattered the</p>
<p class="calibre1">myth of Western exceptionalism and paved the way for the world he was</p>
<p class="calibre1">born into.)</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Adult-Manni wears an avatar roughly modeled on his clone-father</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred - skinnier, pegged at a youthful twentysomething, black-clad,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and gothic. He’s taking time out from a game of Matrix to listen to</p>
<p class="calibre1">music, Type O Negative blaring over the sound system as he twitches in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the grip of an ice-cold coke high. He’s expecting a visit from a</p>
<p class="calibre1">couple of call girls - themselves the gamespace avatars of force-grown</p>
<p class="calibre1">adult ghosts whose primaries may not be adult, or female, or even</p>
<p class="calibre1">human - which is why he’s flopped bonelessly back in his Arne Jacobsen</p>
<p class="calibre1">recliner, waiting for something to happen.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The door opens behind him. He doesn’t show any sign of noticing the</p>
<p class="calibre1">intrusion, although his pupils dilate slightly at the faint reflection</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a woman, stalking toward him, glimpsed dimly in the window glass.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re late,” he says tonelessly. “You were supposed to be here ten</p>
<p class="calibre1">minutes ago -” He begins to look round, and now his eyes widen.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who were you expecting?” asks the ice blond in the black business</p>
<p class="calibre1">suit, long-skirted and uptight. There’s something predatory about her</p>
<p class="calibre1">expression: “No, don’t tell me. So you’re Manni, eh? Manni’s partial?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">She sniffs, disapproval. “Fin de si�cle decadence. I’m sure Sirhan</p>
<p class="calibre1">wouldn’t approve.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My father can go fuck himself,” Manni says truculently. “Who the hell</p>
<p class="calibre1">are you?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blond snaps her fingers: An office chair appears on the carpet</p>
<p class="calibre1">between Manni and the window, and she sits on the edge of it,</p>
<p class="calibre1">smoothing her skirt obsessively. “I’m Pamela,” she says tightly. “Has</p>
<p class="calibre1">your father told you about me?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manni looks puzzled. In the back of his mind, raw instincts alien to</p>
<p class="calibre1">anyone instantiated before the midpoint of the twenty-first century</p>
<p class="calibre1">tug on the fabric of pseudoreality. “You’re dead, aren’t you?” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">asks. “One of my ancestors.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m as dead as you are.” She gives him a wintry smile. “Nobody stays</p>
<p class="calibre1">dead these days, least of all people who know Aineko.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manni blinks. Now he’s beginning to feel a surge of mild irritation.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is all very well, but I was expecting company,” he says with</p>
<p class="calibre1">heavy emphasis. “Not a family reunion, or a tiresome attempt to preach</p>
<p class="calibre1">your puritanism -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pamela snorts. “Wallow in your pigsty for all I care, kid, I’ve got</p>
<p class="calibre1">more important things to worry about. Have you looked at your primary</p>
<p class="calibre1">recently?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My primary?” Manni tenses. “He’s doing okay.” For a moment his eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">focus on infinity, a thousand-yard stare as he loads and replays the</p>
<p class="calibre1">latest brain dump from his infant self. “Who’s the cat he’s playing</p>
<p class="calibre1">with? That’s no companion!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aineko. I told you.” Pamela taps the arm of her chair impatiently.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The family curse has come for another generation. And if you don’t do</p>
<p class="calibre1">something about it -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About what?” Manni sits up. “What are you talking about?” He comes to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his feet and turns toward her. Outside the window, the sky is growing</p>
<p class="calibre1">dark with an echo of his own foreboding. Pamela is on her feet before</p>
<p class="calibre1">him, the chair evaporated in a puff of continuity clipping, her</p>
<p class="calibre1">expression a cold-eyed challenge.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think you know exactly what I’m talking about, Manni. It’s time to</p>
<p class="calibre1">stop playing this fucking game. Grow up, while you’ve still got the</p>
<p class="calibre1">chance!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m -” He stops. “Who am I?” he asks, a chill wind of uncertainty</p>
<p class="calibre1">drying the sweat that has sprung up and down his spine. “And what are</p>
<p class="calibre1">you doing here?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you really want to know the answer? I’m dead, remember. The dead</p>
<p class="calibre1">know everything. And that isn’t necessarily good for the living …”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He takes a deep breath. “Am I dead too?” He looks puzzled. “There’s an</p>
<p class="calibre1">adult-me in Seventh Cube Heaven, what’s he doing here?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s the kind of coincidence that isn’t.” She reaches out and takes</p>
<p class="calibre1">his hand, dumping encrypted tokens deep into his sensorium, a trail of</p>
<p class="calibre1">bread crumbs leading into a dark and trackless part of mindspace.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Want to find out? Follow me.” Then she vanishes.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manni leans forward, baffled and frightened, staring down at the</p>
<p class="calibre1">frozen majesty of the onrushing airliner below his window. “Shit,” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">whispers. She came right through my defenses without leaving a trace.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Who is she? The ghost of his dead great-grandmother, or something</p>
<p class="calibre1">else?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ll have to follow her if I want to find out, he realizes. He holds</p>
<p class="calibre1">up his left hand, stares at the invisible token glowing brightly</p>
<p class="calibre1">inside his husk of flesh. “Resynchronize me with my primary,” he says.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">A fraction of a second later, the floor of the penthouse bucks and</p>
<p class="calibre1">quakes wildly and fire alarms begin to shriek as time comes to an end</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the frozen airliner completes its journey. But Manni isn’t there</p>
<p class="calibre1">anymore. And if a skyscraper falls in a simulation with nobody to see</p>
<p class="calibre1">it, has anything actually happened?</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve come for the boy,” says the cat. It sits on the hand woven rug</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the middle of the hardwood floor with one hind leg sticking out at</p>
<p class="calibre1">an odd angle, as if it’s forgotten about it. Sirhan teeters on the</p>
<p class="calibre1">edge of hysteria for a moment as he apprehends the sheer size of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">entity before him, the whimsical posthuman creation of his ancestors.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Originally a robotic toy companion, Aineko was progressively upgraded</p>
<p class="calibre1">and patched. By the eighties, when Sirhan first met the cat in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">flesh, he was already a terrifyingly alien intelligence, subtle and</p>
<p class="calibre1">ironic. And now …</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan knows Aineko manipulated his eigenmother, bending her natural</p>
<p class="calibre1">affections away from his real father and toward another man. In</p>
<p class="calibre1">moments of black introspection, he sometimes wonders if the cat wasn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">also responsible in some way for his own broken upbringing, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">failure to relate to his real parents. After all, it was a pawn in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">vicious divorce battle between Manfred and Pamela - decades before his</p>
<p class="calibre1">birth - and there might be long-term instructions buried in its</p>
<p class="calibre1">preconscious drives. What if the pawn is actually a hidden king,</p>
<p class="calibre1">scheming in the darkness?</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve come for Manny.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re not having him.” Sirhan maintains an outer facade of calm,</p>
<p class="calibre1">even though his first inclination is to snap at Aineko. “Haven’t you</p>
<p class="calibre1">done enough damage already?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re not going to make this easy, are you?” The cat stretches his</p>
<p class="calibre1">head forward and begins to lick obsessively between the splayed toes</p>
<p class="calibre1">of his raised foot. “I’m not making a demand, kid, I said I’ve come</p>
<p class="calibre1">for him, and you’re not really in the frame at all. In fact, I’m going</p>
<p class="calibre1">out of my way to warn you.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And I say -” Sirhan stops. “Shit!” Sirhan doesn’t approve of</p>
<p class="calibre1">swearing: The curse is an outward demonstration of his inner turmoil.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Forget what I was about to say, I’m sure you already know it. Let me</p>
<p class="calibre1">begin again, please.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure. Let’s play this your way.” The cat chews on a loose nail sheath</p>
<p class="calibre1">but his innerspeech is perfectly clear, a casual intimacy that keeps</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan on edge. “You’ve got some idea of what I am, clearly. You know</p>
<p class="calibre1">- I ascribe intentionality to you - that my theory of mind is</p>
<p class="calibre1">intrinsically stronger than yours, that my cognitive model of human</p>
<p class="calibre1">consciousness is complete. You might well suspect that I use a Turing</p>
<p class="calibre1">Oracle to think my way around your halting states.” The cat isn’t</p>
<p class="calibre1">worrying at a loose claw now, he’s grinning, pointy teeth gleaming in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the light from Sirhan’s study window. The window looks out onto the</p>
<p class="calibre1">inner space of the habitat cylinder, up at a sky with hillsides and</p>
<p class="calibre1">lakes and forests plastered across it: It’s like an Escher landscape,</p>
<p class="calibre1">modeled with complete perfection. “You’ve realized that I can think my</p>
<p class="calibre1">way around the outside of your box while you’re flailing away inside</p>
<p class="calibre1">it, and I’m always one jump ahead of you. What else do you know I</p>
<p class="calibre1">know?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan shivers. Aineko is staring up at him, unblinking. For a moment,</p>
<p class="calibre1">he feels at gut level that he is in the presence of an alien god: It’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">the simple truth, isn’t it? But - “Okay, I concede the point,” Sirhan</p>
<p class="calibre1">says after a moment in which he spawns a blizzard of panicky cognitive</p>
<p class="calibre1">ghosts, fractional personalities each tasked with the examination of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">different facet of the same problem. “You’re smarter than I am. I’m</p>
<p class="calibre1">just a boringly augmented human being, but you’ve got a flashy new</p>
<p class="calibre1">theory of mind that lets you work around creatures like me the way I</p>
<p class="calibre1">can think my way around a real cat.” He crosses his arms defensively.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You do not normally rub this in. It’s not in your interests to do so,</p>
<p class="calibre1">is it? You prefer to hide your manipulative capabilities under an</p>
<p class="calibre1">affable exterior, to play with us. So you’re revealing all this for a</p>
<p class="calibre1">reason.” There’s a note of bitterness in his voice now. Glancing</p>
<p class="calibre1">round, Sirhan summons up a chair - and, as an afterthought, a cat</p>
<p class="calibre1">basket. “Have a seat. Why now, Aineko? What makes you think you can</p>
<p class="calibre1">take my eigenson?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t say I was going to take him, I said I’d come for him.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko’s tail lashes from side to side in agitation. “I don’t deal in</p>
<p class="calibre1">primate politics, Sirhan: I’m not a monkey-boy. But I knew you’d react</p>
<p class="calibre1">badly because the way your species socializes” - a dozen metaghosts</p>
<p class="calibre1">reconverge in Sirhan’s mind, drowning Aineko’s voice in an inner</p>
<p class="calibre1">cacophony - “would enter into the situation, and it seemed preferable</p>
<p class="calibre1">to trigger your territorial/reproductive threat display early, rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">than risk it exploding in my face during a more delicate situation.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sirhan waves a hand vaguely at the cat: “Please wait.” He’s trying to</p>
<p class="calibre1">integrate his false memories - the output from the ghosts, their</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking finished - and his eyes narrow suspiciously. “It must be bad.</p>
<p class="calibre1">You don’t normally get confrontational - you script your interactions</p>
<p class="calibre1">with humans ahead of time, so that you maneuver them into doing what</p>
<p class="calibre1">you want them to do and thinking it was their idea all along.” He</p>
<p class="calibre1">tenses. “What is it about Manni that brought you here? What do you</p>
<p class="calibre1">want with him? He’s just a kid.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re confusing Manni with Manfred.” Aineko sends a glyph of a smile</p>
<p class="calibre1">to Sirhan: “That’s your first mistake, even though they’re clones in</p>
<p class="calibre1">different subjective states. Think what he’s like when he’s grown up.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But he isn’t grown-up!” Sirhan complains. “He hasn’t been grown-up</p>
<p class="calibre1">for -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“- Years, Sirhan. That’s the problem. I need to talk to your</p>
<p class="calibre1">grandfather, really, not your son, and not the goddamn stateless ghost</p>
<p class="calibre1">in the temple of history, I need a Manfred with a sense of continuity.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s got something that I need, and I promise you I’m not going away</p>
<p class="calibre1">until I get it. Do you understand?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” Sirhan wonders if his voice sounds as hollow as the feeling in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his chest. “But he’s our kid, Aineko. We’re human. You know what that</p>
<p class="calibre1">means to us?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Second childhood.” Aineko stands up, stretches, then curls up in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cat basket. “That’s the trouble with hacking you naked apes for long</p>
<p class="calibre1">life, you keep needing a flush and reset job - and then you lose</p>
<p class="calibre1">continuity. That’s not my problem, Sirhan. I got a signal from the far</p>
<p class="calibre1">edge of the router network, a ghost that claims to be family. Says</p>
<p class="calibre1">they finally made it out to the big beyond, out past the B�otes</p>
<p class="calibre1">supercluster, found something concrete and important that’s worth my</p>
<p class="calibre1">while to visit. But I want to make sure it’s not like the Wunch before</p>
<p class="calibre1">I answer. I’m not letting that into my mind, even with a sandbox. Do</p>
<p class="calibre1">you understand that? I need to instantiate a reallive adult Manfred</p>
<p class="calibre1">with all his memories, one who hasn’t been a part of me, and get him</p>
<p class="calibre1">to vouch for the sapient data packet. It takes a conscious being to</p>
<p class="calibre1">authenticate that kind of messenger. Unfortunately, the history temple</p>
<p class="calibre1">is annoyingly resistant to unauthorized extraction - I can’t just go</p>
<p class="calibre1">in and steal a copy of him - and I don’t want to use my own model of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred: It knows too much. So -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s it promising?” Sirhan asks tensely.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko looks at him through slitted eyes, a purring buzz at the base</p>
<p class="calibre1">of his throat: “Everything.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There are different kinds of death,” the woman called Pamela tells</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manni, her bone-dry voice a whisper in the darkness. Manni tries to</p>
<p class="calibre1">move, but he seems to be trapped in a confined space; for a moment, he</p>
<p class="calibre1">begins to panic, but then he works it out. “First and most</p>
<p class="calibre1">importantly, death is just the absence of life - oh, and for human</p>
<p class="calibre1">beings, the absence of consciousness, too, but not just the absence of</p>
<p class="calibre1">consciousness, the absence of the capacity for consciousness.” The</p>
<p class="calibre1">darkness is close and disorienting and Manni isn’t sure which way up</p>
<p class="calibre1">he is - nothing seems to work. Even Pamela’s voice is a directionless</p>
<p class="calibre1">ambiance, coming from all around him.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Simple old-fashioned death, the kind that predated the singularity,</p>
<p class="calibre1">used to be the inevitable halting state for all life-forms. Fairy</p>
<p class="calibre1">tales about afterlives notwithstanding.” A dry chuckle: “I used to try</p>
<p class="calibre1">to believe a different one before breakfast every day, you know, just</p>
<p class="calibre1">in case Pascal’s wager was right - exploring the phase-space of all</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible resurrections, you know? But I think at this point we can</p>
<p class="calibre1">agree that Dawkins was right. Human consciousness is vulnerable to</p>
<p class="calibre1">certain types of transmissible memetic virus, and religions that</p>
<p class="calibre1">promise life beyond death are a particularly pernicious example</p>
<p class="calibre1">because they exploit our natural aversion to halting states.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manni tries to say, I’m not dead, but his throat doesn’t seem to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">working. And now that he thinks about it, he doesn’t seem to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">breathing, either.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now, consciousness. That’s a fun thing, isn’t it? Product of an arms</p>
<p class="calibre1">race between predators and prey. If you watch a cat creeping up on a</p>
<p class="calibre1">mouse, you’ll be able to impute to the cat intentions that are most</p>
<p class="calibre1">easily explained by the cat having a theory of mind concerning the</p>
<p class="calibre1">mouse - an internal simulation of the mouse’s likely behavior when it</p>
<p class="calibre1">notices the predator. Which way to run, for example. And the cat will</p>
<p class="calibre1">use its theory of mind to optimize its attack strategy. Meanwhile,</p>
<p class="calibre1">prey species that are complex enough to have a theory of mind are at a</p>
<p class="calibre1">defensive advantage if they can anticipate a predator’s actions.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually this very mammalian arms race gave us a species of social</p>
<p class="calibre1">ape that used its theory of mind to facilitate signaling - so the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tribe could work collectively - and then reflexively, to simulate the</p>
<p class="calibre1">individual’s own inner states. Put the two things together, signaling</p>
<p class="calibre1">and introspective simulation, and you’ve got human-level</p>
<p class="calibre1">consciousness, with language thrown in as a bonus - signaling that</p>
<p class="calibre1">transmits information about internal states, not just crude signals</p>
<p class="calibre1">such as ‘predator here’ or ‘food there.’”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Get me out of this! Manny feels panic biting into him with</p>
<p class="calibre1">liquid-helium-lubricated teeth. “G-e-t -” For a miracle the words</p>
<p class="calibre1">actually come out, although he can’t tell quite how he’s uttering</p>
<p class="calibre1">them, his throat being quite as frozen as his innerspeech.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything’s off-lined, all systems down.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,” Pamela continues remorselessly, “we come to the posthuman. Not</p>
<p class="calibre1">just our own neural wetware, mapped out to the subcellular level and</p>
<p class="calibre1">executed in an emulation environment on a honking great big computer,</p>
<p class="calibre1">like this: That’s not posthuman, that’s a travesty. I’m talking about</p>
<p class="calibre1">beings who are fundamentally better consciousness engines than us</p>
<p class="calibre1">merely human types, augmented or otherwise. They’re not just better at</p>
<p class="calibre1">cooperation - witness Economics 2.0 for a classic demonstration of</p>
<p class="calibre1">that - but better at simulation. A posthuman can build an internal</p>
<p class="calibre1">model of a human-level intelligence that is, well, as cognitively</p>
<p class="calibre1">strong as the original. You or I may think we know what makes other</p>
<p class="calibre1">people tick, but we’re quite often wrong, whereas real posthumans can</p>
<p class="calibre1">actually simulate us, inner states and all, and get it right. And this</p>
<p class="calibre1">is especially true of a posthuman that’s been given full access to our</p>
<p class="calibre1">memory prostheses for a period of years, back before we realized they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were going to transcend on us. Isn’t that the case, Manni?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manni would be screaming at her right now, if he had a mouth - but</p>
<p class="calibre1">instead the panic is giving way to an enormous sense of d�ja vu.</p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s something about Pamela, something ominous that he knows …</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’s met her before, he’s sure of it. And while most of his systems</p>
<p class="calibre1">are off-line, one of them is very much active: There’s a personality</p>
<p class="calibre1">ghost flagging its intention of merging back in with him, and the</p>
<p class="calibre1">memory delta it carries is enormous, years and years of divergent</p>
<p class="calibre1">experiences to absorb. He shoves it away with a titanic effort - it’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">a very insistent ghost - and concentrates on imagining the feel of</p>
<p class="calibre1">lips moving on teeth, a sly tongue obstructing his epiglottis, words</p>
<p class="calibre1">forming in his throat - “m-e …”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We should have known better than to keep upgrading the cat, Manny. It</p>
<p class="calibre1">knows us too well. I may have died in the flesh, but Aineko remembered</p>
<p class="calibre1">me, as hideously accurately as the Vile Offspring remembered the</p>
<p class="calibre1">random resimulated. And you can run away - like this, this second</p>
<p class="calibre1">childhood - but you can’t hide. Your cat wants you. And there’s more.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her voice sends chills up and down his spine, for without him giving</p>
<p class="calibre1">it permission, the ghost has begun to merge its stupendous load of</p>
<p class="calibre1">memories with his neural map, and her voice is freighted with</p>
<p class="calibre1">erotic/repulsive significance, the result of conditioning feedback he</p>
<p class="calibre1">subjected himself to a lifetime - lifetimes? - ago: “He’s been playing</p>
<p class="calibre1">with us, Manny, possibly from before we realized he was conscious.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Out -” Manfred stops. He can see again, and move, and feel his mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre1">He’s himself again, physically back as he was in his late twenties all</p>
<p class="calibre1">those decades ago when he’d lived a peripatetic life in presingularity</p>
<p class="calibre1">Europe. He’s sitting on the edge of a bed in a charmingly themed</p>
<p class="calibre1">Amsterdam hotel with a recurrent motif of philosophers, wearing jeans</p>
<p class="calibre1">and collarless shirt and a vest of pockets crammed with the detritus</p>
<p class="calibre1">of a long-obsolete personal area network, his crazily clunky</p>
<p class="calibre1">projection specs sitting on the bedside table. Pamela stands stiffly</p>
<p class="calibre1">in front of the door, watching him. She’s not the withered travesty he</p>
<p class="calibre1">remembers seeing on Saturn, a half-blind Fate leaning on the shoulder</p>
<p class="calibre1">of his grandson. Nor is she the vengeful Fury of Paris, or the</p>
<p class="calibre1">scheming fundamentalist devil of the Belt. Wearing a sharply tailored</p>
<p class="calibre1">suit over a red-and-gold brocade corset, blonde hair drawn back like</p>
<p class="calibre1">fine wire in a tight chignon, she’s the focused, driven force of</p>
<p class="calibre1">nature he first fell in love with: repression, domination, his very</p>
<p class="calibre1">own strict machine.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re dead,” she says, then gives voice to a tense half laugh: “We</p>
<p class="calibre1">don’t have to live through the bad times again if we don’t want to.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is this?” he asks, his mouth dry.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s the reproductive imperative.” She sniffs. “Come on, stand up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Come here.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He stands up obediently, but makes no move toward her. “Whose</p>
<p class="calibre1">imperative?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not ours.” Her cheek twitches. “You find things out when you’re dead.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That fucking cat has got a lot of questions to answer.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re telling me that -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She shrugs. “Can you think of any other explanation for all this?”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then she steps forward and takes his hand. “Division and</p>
<p class="calibre1">recombination. Partitioning of memetic replicators into different</p>
<p class="calibre1">groups, then careful cross-fertilization. Aineko wasn’t just breeding</p>
<p class="calibre1">a better Macx when he arranged all those odd marriages and divorces</p>
<p class="calibre1">and eigenparents and forked uploads - Aineko is trying to breed our</p>
<p class="calibre1">minds.” Her fingers are slim and cool in his hand. He feels a</p>
<p class="calibre1">momentary revulsion, as of the grave, and he shudders before he</p>
<p class="calibre1">realizes it’s his conditioning cutting in. Crudely implanted reflexes</p>
<p class="calibre1">that shouldn’t still be active after all this time. “Even our divorce.</p>
<p class="calibre1">If -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Surely not.” Manny remembers that much already. “Aineko wasn’t even</p>
<p class="calibre1">conscious back then!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pamela raises one sharply sculpted eyebrow: “Are you sure?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You want an answer,” he says.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She breathes deeply, and he feels it on his cheek - it raises the fine</p>
<p class="calibre1">hairs on the back of his neck. Then she nods stiffly. “I want to know</p>
<p class="calibre1">how much of our history was scripted by the cat. Back when we thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">we were upgrading his firmware, were we? Or was he letting us think</p>
<p class="calibre1">that we were?” A sharp hiss of breath: “The divorce. Was that us? Or</p>
<p class="calibre1">were we being manipulated?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our memories, are they real? Did any of that stuff actually happen to</p>
<p class="calibre1">us? Or -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’s standing about twenty centimeters away from him, and Manfred</p>
<p class="calibre1">realizes that he’s acutely aware of her presence, of the smell of her</p>
<p class="calibre1">skin, the heave of her bosom as she breathes, the dilation of her</p>
<p class="calibre1">pupils. For an endless moment he stares into her eyes and sees his own</p>
<p class="calibre1">reflection - her theory of his mind - staring back. Communication.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Strict machine. She steps back a pace, spike heels clicking, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">smiles ironically. “You’ve got a host body waiting for you, freshly</p>
<p class="calibre1">fabbed: Seems Sirhan was talking to your archived ghost in the temple</p>
<p class="calibre1">of history, and it decided to elect for reincarnation. Quite a day for</p>
<p class="calibre1">huge coincidences, isn’t it? Why don’t you go merge with it - I’ll</p>
<p class="calibre1">meet you, then we can go and ask Aineko some hard questions.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred takes a deep breath and nods. “I suppose so …”</p>

<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Little Manni - a clone off the family tree, which is actually a</p>
<p class="calibre1">directed cyclic graph - doesn’t understand what all the fuss is about</p>
<p class="calibre1">but he can tell when momma, Rita, is upset. It’s something to do with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the pussycat-thing, that much he knows, but Momma doesn’t want to tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">him: “Go play with your friends, dear,” she says distractedly, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">even bothering to spawn a ghost to watch over him.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manni goes into his room and rummages around in toyspace for a bit,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but there’s nothing quite as interesting as the cat. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">pussycat-thing smells of adventure, the illicit made explicit. Manni</p>
<p class="calibre1">wonders where daddy’s taken it. He tries to call big-Manni-ghost, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">big-self isn’t answering: He’s probably sleeping or something. So</p>
<p class="calibre1">after a distracted irritated fit of play - which leaves the toyspace</p>
<p class="calibre1">in total disarray, Sendak-things cowering under a big bass drum -</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manni gets bored. And because he’s still basically a little kid, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">not fully in control of his own metaprogramming, instead of adjusting</p>
<p class="calibre1">his outlook so that he isn’t bored anymore, he sneaks out through his</p>
<p class="calibre1">bedroom gate (which big-Manni-ghost reprogrammed for him sometime ago</p>
<p class="calibre1">so that it would forward to an underused public A-gate that he’d run a</p>
<p class="calibre1">man-in-the-middle hack on, so he could use it as a proxy teleport</p>
<p class="calibre1">server) then down to the underside of Red Plaza, where skinless things</p>
<p class="calibre1">gibber and howl at their tormentors, broken angels are crucified on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the pillars that hold up the sky, and gangs of semiferal children act</p>
<p class="calibre1">out their psychotic fantasies on mouthless android replicas of parents</p>
<p class="calibre1">and authorities.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lis is there, and Vipul and Kareen and Morgan. Lis has changed into a</p>
<p class="calibre1">warbody, an ominous gray battlebot husk with protruding spikes and a</p>
<p class="calibre1">belt of morningstars that whirl threateningly around her. “Manni! Play</p>
<p class="calibre1">war?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morgan’s got great crushing pincers instead of hands, and Manni is</p>
<p class="calibre1">glad he came motie-style, his third arm a bony scythe from the elbow</p>
<p class="calibre1">down. He nods excitedly. “Who’s the enemy?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Them.” Lis precesses and points at a bunch of kids on the far side of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a pile of artistically arranged rubble who are gathered around a</p>
<p class="calibre1">gibbet, poking things that glow into the flinching flesh of whatever</p>
<p class="calibre1">is incarcerated in the cast-iron cage. It’s all make-believe, but the</p>
<p class="calibre1">screams are convincing, all the same, and they take Manni back for an</p>
<p class="calibre1">instant to the last time he died down here, the uneasy edit around a</p>
<p class="calibre1">black hole of pain surrounding his disemboweling. “They’ve got Lucy,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and they’re torturing her, we’ve got to get her back.” Nobody really</p>
<p class="calibre1">dies in these games, not permanently, but children can be very rough</p>
<p class="calibre1">indeed, and the adults of New Japan have found that it’s best to let</p>
<p class="calibre1">them have at each other and rely on City to redact the damage later.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Allowing them this outlet makes it easier to stop them doing really</p>
<p class="calibre1">dangerous things that threaten the structural integrity of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">biosphere.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fun.” Manni’s eyes light up as Vipul yanks the arsenal doors open and</p>
<p class="calibre1">starts handing out clubs, chibs, spikies, shuriken, and garrotes.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s go!”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">About ten minutes of gouging, running, fighting, and screaming later,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manni is leaning against the back of a crucifixion pillar, panting for</p>
<p class="calibre1">breath. It’s been a good war for him so far, and his arm aches and</p>
<p class="calibre1">itches from the stabbing, but he’s got a bad feeling it’s going to</p>
<p class="calibre1">change. Lis went in hard and got her chains tangled up around the</p>
<p class="calibre1">gibbet supports - they’re roasting her over a fire now, her</p>
<p class="calibre1">electronically boosted screams drowning out his own hoarse gasps.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Blood drips down his arm - not his - spattering from the tip of his</p>
<p class="calibre1">claw. He shakes with a crazed hunger for hurt, a cruel need to inflict</p>
<p class="calibre1">pain. Something above his head makes a scritch, scritch sound, and he</p>
<p class="calibre1">looks up. It’s a crucified angel, wings ripped where they’ve thrust</p>
<p class="calibre1">the spikes in between the joints that support the great, thin low-gee</p>
<p class="calibre1">flight membranes. It’s still breathing, nobody’s bothered</p>
<p class="calibre1">disemboweling it yet, and it wouldn’t be here unless it was bad, so -</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manni stands, but as he reaches out to touch the angel’s thin,</p>
<p class="calibre1">blue-skinned stomach with his third arm fingernail, he hears a voice:</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait.” It’s innerspeech, and it bears ackles of coercion, superuser</p>
<p class="calibre1">privileges that lock his elbow joint in place. He mewls frustratedly</p>
<p class="calibre1">and turns round, ready to fight.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s the cat. He sits hunched on a boulder behind him - this is the</p>
<p class="calibre1">odd thing - right where he was looking a moment ago, watching him with</p>
<p class="calibre1">slitty eyes. Manni feels the urge to lash out at him, but his arms</p>
<p class="calibre1">won’t move, and neither will his legs: This may be the Dark Side of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Red Plaza, where the bloody children play and anything goes, and Manni</p>
<p class="calibre1">may have a much bigger claw here than anything the cat can muster, but</p>
<p class="calibre1">City still has some degree of control, and the cat’s ackles</p>
<p class="calibre1">effectively immunize it from the carnage to either side. “Hello,</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manni,” says the pussy-thing. “Your Dad’s worried: You’re supposed to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be in your room, and he’s looking for you. Big-you gave you a back</p>
<p class="calibre1">door, didn’t he?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manni nods jerkily, his eyes going wide. He wants to shout and lash</p>
<p class="calibre1">out at the pussy-thing but he can’t. “What are you?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m your … fairy godfather.” The cat stares at him intently. “You</p>
<p class="calibre1">know, I do believe you don’t resemble your archetype very closely -</p>
<p class="calibre1">not as he was at your age - but yes, I think on balance you’ll do.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do what?” Manni lets his motie-arm drop, perplexed.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Put me in touch with your other self. Big-you.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t,” Manni begins to explain. But before he can continue, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pile of rock whines slightly and rotates beneath the cat, who has to</p>
<p class="calibre1">stand and do a little twirl in place, tail bushing up in annoyance.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manni’s father steps out of the T-gate and glances around, his face a</p>
<p class="calibre1">mask of disapproval. “Manni! What do you think you’re doing here? Come</p>
<p class="calibre1">home at -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s with me, history-boy,” interrupts the cat, nettled by Sirhan’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrival. “I was just rounding him up.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Damn you, I don’t need your help to control my son! In fact -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mom said I could -” Manni begins.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And what’s that on your sword?” Sirhan’s glare takes in the whole</p>
<p class="calibre1">scene, the impromptu game of capture-the-gibbeted-torture-victim, the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bonfires and screams. The mask of disapproval cracks, revealing a core</p>
<p class="calibre1">of icy anger. “You’re coming home with me!” He glances at the cat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You too, if you want to talk to him - he’s grounded.”</p>

<p class="calibre1">Once upon a time there was a pet cat.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Except, it wasn’t a cat.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back when a young entrepreneur called Manfred Macx was jetting</p>
<p class="calibre1">around the not-yet-disassembled structures of an old continent</p>
<p class="calibre1">called Europe, making strangers rich and fixing up friends with</p>
<p class="calibre1">serendipitous business plans - a desperate displacement activity,</p>
<p class="calibre1">spinning his wheels in a vain attempt to outrun his own shadow - he</p>
<p class="calibre1">used to travel with a robotic toy of feline form. Programmable and</p>
<p class="calibre1">upgradeable, Aineko was a third-generation descendant of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">original luxury Japanese companion robots. It was all Manfred had</p>
<p class="calibre1">room for in his life, and he loved that robot, despite the alarming</p>
<p class="calibre1">way decerebrated kittens kept turning up on his doorstep. He loved</p>
<p class="calibre1">it nearly as much as Pamela, his fianc�e, loved him, and she knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">it. Pamela, being a whole lot smarter than Manfred gave her credit</p>
<p class="calibre1">for, realized that the quickest way to a man’s heart was through</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatever he loved. And Pamela, being a whole lot more of a control</p>
<p class="calibre1">freak than Manfred realized, was damn well ready to use any</p>
<p class="calibre1">restraint that came to hand. Theirs was a very twenty-first-century</p>
<p class="calibre1">kind of relationship, which is to say one that would have been</p>
<p class="calibre1">illegal a hundred years earlier and fashionably scandalous a</p>
<p class="calibre1">century before that. And whenever Manfred upgraded his pet robot -</p>
<p class="calibre1">transplanting its trainable neural network into a new body with new</p>
<p class="calibre1">and exciting expansion ports - Pamela would hack it.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were married for a while, and divorced for a whole lot longer,</p>
<p class="calibre1">allegedly because they were both strong-willed people with</p>
<p class="calibre1">philosophies of life that were irreconcilable short of death or</p>
<p class="calibre1">transcendence. Manny, being wildly creative and outward-directed</p>
<p class="calibre1">and having the attention span of a weasel on crack, had other</p>
<p class="calibre1">lovers. Pamela … who knows? If on some evenings she put on a</p>
<p class="calibre1">disguise and hung out at encounter areas in fetish clubs, she</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn’t telling anyone: She lived in uptight America, staidly</p>
<p class="calibre1">straitlaced, and had a reputation to uphold. But they both stayed</p>
<p class="calibre1">in touch with the cat, and although Manfred retained custody for</p>
<p class="calibre1">some reason never articulated, Aineko kept returning Pamela’s calls</p>
<p class="calibre1">- until it was time to go hang out with their daughter Amber,</p>
<p class="calibre1">tagging along on her rush into relativistic exile, then keeping a</p>
<p class="calibre1">proprietorial eye on her eigenson Sirhan, and his wife and child (a</p>
<p class="calibre1">clone off the old family tree, Manfred 2.0) …</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, here’s the rub: Aineko wasn’t a cat. Aineko was an incarnate</p>
<p class="calibre1">intelligence, confined within a succession of catlike bodies that</p>
<p class="calibre1">became increasingly realistic over time, and equipped with</p>
<p class="calibre1">processing power to support a neural simulation that grew rapidly</p>
<p class="calibre1">with each upgrade.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Did anyone in the Macx family ever think to ask what Aineko wanted?</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">And if an answer had come, would they have liked it?</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1"><i class="calibre5"> </i> *</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Adult-Manfred, still disoriented from finding himself awake and</p>
<p class="calibre1">reinstantiated a couple of centuries downstream from his hurried exile</p>
<p class="calibre1">from Saturn system, is hesitantly navigating his way toward Sirhan and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rita’s home when big-Manni-with-Manfred’s-memory-ghost drops into his</p>
<p class="calibre1">consciousness like a ton of computronium glowing red-hot at the edges.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s a classic oh-shit moment. Between one foot touching the ground</p>
<p class="calibre1">and the next, Manfred stumbles hard, nearly twisting an ankle, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">gasps. He remembers. At third hand he remembers being reincarnated as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manni, a bouncing baby boy for Rita and Sirhan (and just why they want</p>
<p class="calibre1">to raise an ancestor instead of creating a new child of their own is</p>
<p class="calibre1">one of those cultural quirks that is so alien he can scarcely</p>
<p class="calibre1">comprehend it). Then for a while he recalls living as Manni’s amnesic</p>
<p class="calibre1">adult accelerated ghost, watching over his original from the consensus</p>
<p class="calibre1">cyberspace of the city: the arrival of Pamela, adult Manni’s reaction</p>
<p class="calibre1">to her, her dump of yet another copy of Manfred’s memories into Manni,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and now this - How many of me are there? he wonders nervously. Then:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Pamela? What’s she doing here?</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred shakes his head and looks about. Now he remembers being</p>
<p class="calibre1">big-Manni, he knows where he is implicitly, and more importantly,</p>
<p class="calibre1">knows what all these next-gen City interfaces are supposed to do. The</p>
<p class="calibre1">walls and ceiling are carpeted in glowing glyphs that promise him</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything from instant-access local services to teleportation across</p>
<p class="calibre1">interstellar distances. So they haven’t quite collapsed geography yet,</p>
<p class="calibre1">he realizes gratefully, fastening on to the nearest comprehensible</p>
<p class="calibre1">thought of his own before old-Manni’s memories explain everything for</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. It’s a weird sensation, seeing all this stuff for the first time</p>
<p class="calibre1">- the trappings of a technosphere centuries ahead of the one he’s last</p>
<p class="calibre1">been awake in - but with the memories to explain it all. He finds his</p>
<p class="calibre1">feet are still carrying him forward, toward a grassy square lined with</p>
<p class="calibre1">doors opening onto private dwellings. Behind one of them, he’s going</p>
<p class="calibre1">to meet his descendants, and Pamela in all probability. The thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">makes his stomach give a little queasy backflip. I’m not ready for</p>
<p class="calibre1">this -</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s an acute moment of d�ja vu. He’s standing on a familiar doorstep</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’s never seen before. The door opens and a serious-faced child with</p>
<p class="calibre1">three arms - he can’t help staring, the extra one is a viciously</p>
<p class="calibre1">barbed scythe of bone from the elbow down - looks up at him. “Hello,</p>
<p class="calibre1">me,” says the kid.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello, you.” Manfred stares. “You don’t look the way I remember.” But</p>
<p class="calibre1">Manni’s appearance is familiar from big-Manni’s memories, captured by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the unblinking Argus awareness of the panopticon dust floating in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">air. “Are your parents home? Your” - his voice cracks -</p>
<p class="calibre1">“great-grandmother?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The door opens wider. “You can come in,” the kid says gravely. Then he</p>
<p class="calibre1">hops backward and ducks shyly into a side room - or as if expecting to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be gunned down by a hostile sniper, Manfred realizes. It’s tough being</p>
<p class="calibre1">a kid when there are no rules against lethal force because you can be</p>
<p class="calibre1">restored from a backup when playtime ends.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside the dwelling - calling it a house seems wrong to Manfred, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">when bits of it are separated by trillions of kilometers of empty</p>
<p class="calibre1">vacuum - things feel a bit crowded. He can hear voices from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dayroom, so he goes there, brushing through the archway of thornless</p>
<p class="calibre1">roses that Rita has trained around the T-gate frame. His body feels</p>
<p class="calibre1">lighter, but his heart is heavy as he looks around. “Rita?” he asks.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“And -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello, Manfred.” Pamela nods at him guardedly.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rita raises an eyebrow at him. “The cat asked if he could borrow the</p>
<p class="calibre1">household assembler. I wasn’t expecting a family reunion.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Neither was I.” Manfred rubs his forehead ruefully. “Pamela, this is</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rita. She’s married to Sirhan. They’re my - I guess eigenparents is as</p>
<p class="calibre1">good as term as any? I mean, they’re bringing up my reincarnation.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please, have a seat,” Rita offers, waving at the empty floor between</p>
<p class="calibre1">the patio and the stone fountain in the shape of a section through a</p>
<p class="calibre1">glass hypersphere. A futon of spun diamondoid congeals out of the</p>
<p class="calibre1">utility fog floating in the air, glittering in the artificial</p>
<p class="calibre1">sunlight. “Sirhan’s just taking care of Manni - our son. He’ll be with</p>
<p class="calibre1">us in just a minute.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred sits gingerly at one side of the futon. Pamela sits stiffly at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the opposite edge, not meeting his eye. Last time they met in the</p>
<p class="calibre1">flesh - an awesome gulf of years previously - they’d parted cursing</p>
<p class="calibre1">each other, on opposite sides of a fractious divorce as well as an</p>
<p class="calibre1">ideological barrier as high as a continental divide. But many</p>
<p class="calibre1">subjective decades have passed, and both ideology and divorce have</p>
<p class="calibre1">dwindled in significance - if indeed they ever happened. Now that</p>
<p class="calibre1">there’s common cause to draw them together, Manfred can barely look at</p>
<p class="calibre1">her. “How is Manni?” he asks his hostess, desperate for small talk.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He’s fine,” Rita says, in a brittle voice. “Just the usual</p>
<p class="calibre1">preadolescent turbulence, if it wasn’t for …” She trails off. A door</p>
<p class="calibre1">appears in mid air and Sirhan steps through it, followed by a small</p>
<p class="calibre1">deity wearing a fur coat.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look what the cat dragged in,” Aineko remarks.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re a fine one to talk,” Pamela says icily. “Don’t you think you’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">-”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I tried to keep him away from you,” Sirhan tells Manfred, “but he</p>
<p class="calibre1">wouldn’t -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s okay.” Manfred waves it off. “Pamela, would you mind</p>
<p class="calibre1">starting?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I would.” She glances at him sidelong. “You go first.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right. You wanted me here.” Manfred hunkers down to stare at the cat.</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you want?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If I was your traditional middle-European devil, I’d say I’d come to</p>
<p class="calibre1">steal your soul,” says Aineko, looking up at Manfred and twitching his</p>
<p class="calibre1">tail. “Luckily I’m not a dualist, I just want to borrow it for a</p>
<p class="calibre1">while. Won’t even get it dirty.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh-huh.” Manfred raises an eyebrow. “Why?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not omniscient.” Aineko sits down, one leg sticking out sideways,</p>
<p class="calibre1">but continues to stare at Manfred. “I had a … a telegram, I guess,</p>
<p class="calibre1">claiming to be from you. From the other copy of you, that is, the one</p>
<p class="calibre1">that went off through the router network with another copy of me, and</p>
<p class="calibre1">with Amber, and everyone else who isn’t here. It says it found the</p>
<p class="calibre1">answer and it wants to give me a shortcut route out to the deep</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinkers at the edge of the observable universe. It knows who made the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wormhole network and why, and -” Aineko pauses. If he was human, he’d</p>
<p class="calibre1">shrug, but being a cat, he absent mindedly scritches behind his left</p>
<p class="calibre1">ear with a hind leg. “Trouble is, I’m not sure I can trust it. So I</p>
<p class="calibre1">need you to authenticate the message. I don’t dare use my own memory</p>
<p class="calibre1">of you because it knows too much about me; if the package is a Trojan,</p>
<p class="calibre1">it might find out things I don’t want it to learn. I can’t even redact</p>
<p class="calibre1">its memories of me - that, too, would convey useful information to the</p>
<p class="calibre1">packet if it is hostile. So I want a copy of you from the museum,</p>
<p class="calibre1">fresh and uncontaminated.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is that all?” Sirhan asks incredulously.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sounds like enough to me,” Manfred responds. Pamela opens her mouth,</p>
<p class="calibre1">ready to speak, but Manfred makes eye contact and shakes his head</p>
<p class="calibre1">infinitesimally. She looks right back and - a shock goes through him -</p>
<p class="calibre1">nods and closes her mouth. The moment of complicity is dizzying. “I</p>
<p class="calibre1">want something in return.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,” says the cat. He pauses. “You realize it’s a destructive</p>
<p class="calibre1">process.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s a - what?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I need to make a running copy of you. Then I introduce it to the, uh,</p>
<p class="calibre1">alien information, in a sandbox. The sandbox gets destroyed afterward</p>
<p class="calibre1">- it emits just one bit of information, a yes or no to the question,</p>
<p class="calibre1">can I trust the alien information?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh.” Manfred begins to sweat. “Uh. I’m not so sure I like the sound</p>
<p class="calibre1">of that.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s a copy.” Another cat-shrug moment. “You’re a copy. Manni is a</p>
<p class="calibre1">copy. You’ve been copied so many times it’s silly - you realize every</p>
<p class="calibre1">few years every atom in your body changes? Of course, it means a copy</p>
<p class="calibre1">of you gets to die after a lifetime or two of unique, unrepeatable</p>
<p class="calibre1">experiences that you’ll never know about, but that won’t matter to</p>
<p class="calibre1">you.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes it does! You’re talking about condemning a version of me to</p>
<p class="calibre1">death! It may not affect me, here, in this body, but it certainly</p>
<p class="calibre1">affects that other me. Can’t you -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I can’t. If I agreed to rescue the copy if it reached a positive</p>
<p class="calibre1">verdict, that would give it an incentive to lie if the truth was that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the alien message is untrustworthy, wouldn’t it? Also, if I intended</p>
<p class="calibre1">to rescue the copy, that would give the message a back channel through</p>
<p class="calibre1">which to encode an attack. One bit, Manfred, no more.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Agh.” Manfred stops talking. He knows he should be trying to come up</p>
<p class="calibre1">with some kind of objection, but Aineko must have already considered</p>
<p class="calibre1">all his possible responses and planned strategies around them. “Where</p>
<p class="calibre1">does she fit into this?” he asks, nodding at Pamela.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, she’s your payment,” Aineko says with studied insouciance. “I</p>
<p class="calibre1">have a very good memory for people, especially people I’ve known for</p>
<p class="calibre1">decades. You’ve outlasted that crude emotional conditioning I used on</p>
<p class="calibre1">you around the time of the divorce, and as for her, she’s a good</p>
<p class="calibre1">reinstantiation of -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you know what it’s like to die?” Pamela asks, finally losing her</p>
<p class="calibre1">self-control. “Or would you like to find out the hard way? Because if</p>
<p class="calibre1">you keep talking about me as if I’m a slave -”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What makes you think you aren’t?” The cat is grinning hideously,</p>
<p class="calibre1">needle like teeth bared. Why doesn’t she hit him? Manfred asks himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">fuzzily, wondering also why he feels no urge to move against the</p>
<p class="calibre1">monster. “Hybridizing you with Manfred was, admittedly, a fine piece</p>
<p class="calibre1">of work on my part, but you would have been bad for him during his</p>
<p class="calibre1">peak creative years. A contented Manfred is an idle Manfred. I got</p>
<p class="calibre1">several extra good bits of work out of him by splitting you up, and by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the time he burned out, Amber was ready. But I digress; if you give me</p>
<p class="calibre1">what I want, I shall leave you alone. It’s as simple as that. Raising</p>
<p class="calibre1">new generations of Macxs has been a good hobby, you make interesting</p>
<p class="calibre1">pets, but ultimately it’s limited by your stubborn refusal to</p>
<p class="calibre1">transcend your humanity. So that’s what I’m offering, basically. Let</p>
<p class="calibre1">me destructively run a copy of you to completion in a black box along</p>
<p class="calibre1">with a purported Turing Oracle based on yourself, and I’ll let you go.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And you too, Pamela. You’ll be happy together this time, without me</p>
<p class="calibre1">pushing you apart. And I promise I won’t return to haunt your</p>
<p class="calibre1">descendants, either.” The cat glances over his shoulder at Sirhan and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rita, who clutch at each other in abject horror; and Manfred finds he</p>
<p class="calibre1">can sense a shadow of Aineko’s huge algorithmic complexity hanging</p>
<p class="calibre1">over the household, like a lurching nightmare out of number theory.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is that all we are to you? A pet-breeding program?” Pamela asks</p>
<p class="calibre1">coldly. She’s run up against Aineko’s implanted limits, too, Manfred</p>
<p class="calibre1">realizes with a growing sense of horror. Did we really split up</p>
<p class="calibre1">because Aineko made us? It’s hard to believe: Manfred is too much of a</p>
<p class="calibre1">realist to trust the cat to tell the truth except when it serves to</p>
<p class="calibre1">further his interests. But this -</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not entirely.” Aineko is complacent. “Not at first, before I was</p>
<p class="calibre1">aware of my own existence. Besides, you humans keep pets, too. But you</p>
<p class="calibre1">were fun to play with.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pamela stands up, angry to the point of storming out. Before he quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">realizes what he’s doing, Manfred is on his feet, too, one arm</p>
<p class="calibre1">protectively around her. “Tell me first, are our memories our own?” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">demands.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t trust it,” Pamela says sharply. “It’s not human, and it lies.”</p>
<p class="calibre1">Her shoulders are tense.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, they are,” says Aineko. He yawns. “Tell me I’m lying, bitch,” he</p>
<p class="calibre1">adds mockingly: “I carried you around in my head for long enough to</p>
<p class="calibre1">know you’ve no evidence.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I -” Her arm slips around Manfred’s waist. “I don’t hate him.” A</p>
<p class="calibre1">rueful laugh: “I remember hating him, but -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Humans: such a brilliant model of emotional self-awareness,” Aineko</p>
<p class="calibre1">says with a theatrical sigh. “You’re as stupid as it’s possible for an</p>
<p class="calibre1">intelligent species to be - there being no evolutionary pressure to be</p>
<p class="calibre1">any smarter - but you still don’t internalize that and act accordingly</p>
<p class="calibre1">around your superiors. Listen, girl, everything you remember is true.</p>
<p class="calibre1">That doesn’t mean you remember it because it actually happened, just</p>
<p class="calibre1">that you remember it because you experienced it internally. Your</p>
<p class="calibre1">memories of experiences are accurate, but your emotional responses to</p>
<p class="calibre1">those experiences were manipulated. Get it? One ape’s hallucination is</p>
<p class="calibre1">another ape’s religious experience, it just depends on which one’s god</p>
<p class="calibre1">module is overactive at the time. That goes for all of you.” Aineko</p>
<p class="calibre1">looks around at them in mild contempt. “But I don’t need you anymore,</p>
<p class="calibre1">and if you do this one thing for me, you’re going to be free.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Understand? Say yes, Manfred; if you leave your mouth open like that,</p>
<p class="calibre1">a bird will nest on your tongue.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Say no -” Pamela urges him, just as Manfred says, “Yes.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko laughs, baring contemptuous fangs at them. “Ah, primate family</p>
<p class="calibre1">loyalty! So wonderful and reliable. Thank you, Manny, I do believe you</p>
<p class="calibre1">just gave me permission to copy and enslave you -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Which is when Manni, who has been waiting in the doorway for the past</p>
<p class="calibre1">minute, leaps on the cat with a scream and a scythelike arm drawn back</p>
<p class="calibre1">and ready to strike.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat-avatar is, of course, ready for Manni: It whirls and hisses,</p>
<p class="calibre1">extending diamond-sharp claws. Sirhan shouts, “No! Manni!” and begins</p>
<p class="calibre1">to move, but adult-Manfred freezes, realizing with a chill that what</p>
<p class="calibre1">is happening is more than is apparent. Manni grabs for the cat with</p>
<p class="calibre1">his human hands, catching it by the scruff of his neck and dragging it</p>
<p class="calibre1">toward his vicious scythe-arm’s edge. There’s a screech, a</p>
<p class="calibre1">nerve-racking caterwauling, and Manni yells, bright parallel blood</p>
<p class="calibre1">tracks on his arm - the avatar is a real fleshbody in its own right,</p>
<p class="calibre1">with an autonomic control system that isn’t going to give up without a</p>
<p class="calibre1">fight, whatever its vastly larger exocortex thinks - but Manni’s</p>
<p class="calibre1">scythe convulses, and there’s a horrible bubbling noise and a spray of</p>
<p class="calibre1">blood as the pussycat-thing goes flying. It’s all over in a second</p>
<p class="calibre1">before any of the adults can really move. Sirhan scoops up Manni and</p>
<p class="calibre1">yanks him away, but there are no hidden surprises. Aineko’s avatar is</p>
<p class="calibre1">just a broken rag of bloody fur, guts, and blood spilled across the</p>
<p class="calibre1">floor. The ghost of a triumphant feline laugh hangs over their</p>
<p class="calibre1">innerspeech ears for a moment, then fades.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bad boy!” Rita shouts, striding forward furiously. Manni cowers, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">begins to cry, a safe reflex for a little boy who doesn’t quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">understand the nature of the threat to his parents.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No! It’s all right,” Manfred seeks to explain.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pamela tightens her grip around him. “Are you still …?”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” He takes a deep breath.</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You bad, bad child -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cat was going to eat him!” Manni protests, as his parents bundle him</p>
<p class="calibre1">protectively out of the room, Sirhan casting a guilty look over his</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulder at the adult instance and his ex-wife. “I had to stop the bad</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing!”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Manfred feels Pamela’s shoulders shaking. It feels like she’s about to</p>
<p class="calibre1">laugh. “I’m still here,” he murmurs, half-surprised. “Spat out,</p>
<p class="calibre1">undigested, after all these years. At least, this version of me thinks</p>
<p class="calibre1">he’s here.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you believe it?” she finally asks, a tone of disbelief in her</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh yes.” He shifts his balance from foot to foot, absent mindedly</p>
<p class="calibre1">stroking her hair. “I believe everything it said was intended to make</p>
<p class="calibre1">us react exactly the way we did. Up to and including giving us good</p>
<p class="calibre1">reasons to hate it and provoking Manni into disposing of its avatar.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko wanted to check out of our lives and figured a sense of</p>
<p class="calibre1">cathartic closure would help. Not to mention playing the deus ex</p>
<p class="calibre1">machina in the narrative of our family life. Fucking classical</p>
<p class="calibre1">comedian.” He checks a status report with Citymind, and sighs: His</p>
<p class="calibre1">version number has just been bumped a point. “Tell me, do you think</p>
<p class="calibre1">you’ll miss having Aineko around? Because we won’t be hearing from him</p>
<p class="calibre1">again -”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t talk about that, not now,” she orders him, digging her chin</p>
<p class="calibre1">against the side of his neck. “I feel so used.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With good reason.” They stand holding each other for a while, not</p>
<p class="calibre1">speaking, not really questioning why - after so much time apart -</p>
<p class="calibre1">they’ve come together again. “Hanging out with gods is never a safe</p>
<p class="calibre1">activity for mere mortals like us. You think you’ve been used? Aineko</p>
<p class="calibre1">has probably killed me by now. Unless he was lying about disposing of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the spare copy, too.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">She shudders in his arms. “That’s the trouble with dealing with</p>
<p class="calibre1">posthumans; their mental model of you is likely to be more detailed</p>
<p class="calibre1">than your own.”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How long have you been awake?” he asks, gently trying to change the</p>
<p class="calibre1">subject.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I - oh, I’m not sure.” She lets go of him and steps back, watching</p>
<p class="calibre1">his face appraisingly. “I remember back on Saturn, stealing a museum</p>
<p class="calibre1">piece and setting out, and then, well. I found myself here. With you.”</p>
<p class="softbreak"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think,” he licks his lips, “we’ve both been given a wake-up call.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Or maybe a second chance. What are you going to do with yours?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know.” That appraising look again, as if she’s trying to work</p>
<p class="calibre1">out what he’s worth. He’s used to it, but this time it doesn’t feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">hostile. “We’ve got too much history for this to be easy. Either</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aineko was lying, or … not. What about you? What do you really</p>
<p class="calibre1">want?”</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">He knows what she’s asking. “Be my mistress?” he asks, offering her a</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand.</p>
<p class="whitespace"> </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This time,” she grips his hand, “without adult supervision.” She</p>
<p class="calibre1">smiles gratefully, and they walk toward the gateway together, to find</p>
<p class="calibre1">out how their descendants are dealing with their sudden freedom.</p>
