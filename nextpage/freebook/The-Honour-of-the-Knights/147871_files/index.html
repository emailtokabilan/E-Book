<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">I</b>t	had	taken	only	a	matter	of	hours	for	the	Kethlan	system	to	become	a	tumbling</p>
<p class="calibre1">sea	 of	 debris;	 the	 twisted	 and	 burnt-out	 remnants	 of	 a	 once	 glorious	 Imperial nation.	 An	 empire	 whose	 costly	 mistakes	 would	 for	 many	 years	 to	 come	 echo</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	 every	 corner	 of	 the	 known	 galaxy.	 And	 with	 those	 mistakes	 would	 come</p>
<p class="calibre1">death	to	billions	of	innocent,	unsuspecting	lives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	starfighter	hurtled	through	the	scattered	metal,	the	pilot	desperate	to	find</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 way	 to	 stop	 himself	 from	 joining	 the	 ever	 growing	 population	 of	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1">interstellar	graveyard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Jacques	Chalmers	was	not	alone	in	his	frustration	with	the	current	situation, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	he	was	doubtless	one	of	the	most	panicked.	He	tried	to	steady	himself	as	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">began	 cycling	 once	 again	 through	 the	 available	 display	 options	 for	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">starfighter's	 radar	 system.	 His	 anxiety	 continued	 to	 grow	 with	 each	 passing</p>
<p class="calibre1">second,	every	change	of	the	screen	doing	nothing	to	abate	it.	He	stopped	midway</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	the	calibration	and	glanced	out	of	his	cockpit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	scene	was	the	same	as	it	had	been	a	few	moments	ago	and	it	brought</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	 no	 comfort.	 He	 couldn't	 count	 the	 number	 of	 capital	 ships	 that	 dominated the	 Enemy's	 frontline.	 Twenty?	 Thirty?	 Fifty?	 In	 his	 years	 of	 service	 to	 the Imperial	 Naval	 Forces	 he	 had	 never	 seen	 anything	 like	 it,	 not	 even	 in	 archive war	 footage.	 The	 enormous	 forms	 of	 the	 battleships	 loomed	 like	 giants	 atop	 a hill,	 staring	 down	 upon	 a	 tiny	 village	 below.	 Then	 there	 were	 the	 Enemy</p>
<p class="calibre1">starfighters	 themselves:	 hundreds	 at	 least,	 swarming	 about	 like	 a	 huge	 wall	 of locusts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Knowing	 that	 he	 had	 already	 been	 flying	 straight	 for	 longer	 than	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">advisable,	Chalmers	altered	his	course	to	attempt	to	throw	off	any	pursuers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>		</p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	 long	 before	 he	 had	 been	 standing	 on	 the	 flight	 deck	 of	 his	 deployment</p>
<p class="calibre1">carrier,	 amongst	 the	 other	 pilots,	 his	 heart	 pumping	 in	 his	 ears,	 his	 hands sweating	as	he	awaited	the	order	to	board	his	fighter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chalmers	 saw	 his	 friends	 run	 forward	 as	 their	 names	 were	 called	 out, </p>
<p class="calibre1">scrambling	 into	 cockpits,	 pulling	 on	 helmets	 and	 performing	 last-minute	 safety checks.	Though	most	hid	it	well,	he	was	convinced	they	were	all	as	nervous	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">scared	 as	 he	 was	 -	 knowing	 they	 could	 well	 be	 speeding	 only	 to	 their	 own</p>
<p class="calibre1">deaths.	 As	 he	 watched	 his	 friends'	 fighters	 hurtle	 down	 the	 catapult,	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">commanding	officer	had	addressed	the	last	remaining	pilots	still	standing	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">flight	deck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,	listen	up,”	he	started.	“This	is	where	we	must	make	our	stand.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Enemy	cannot	be	allowed	to	advance	any	further.	Tonight	we	fight	the	battle	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kethlan	and	for	the	Imperium;	the	battle	for	our	survival.	Hundreds	of	millions</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	lives	are	depending	on	our	actions	here.	Make	them	proud!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Hundreds	 of	 millions? </i>	 thought	 Chalmers.  <i class="calibre4">Is	 that	 all	 that's	 left?	 A	 few</i> <i class="calibre4">months	ago	it	was	billions. </i>	This	day	had	crept	ever	closer	as	cities,	planets	and then	entire	star	systems	had	fallen	to	the	Enemy;	to	those	damned	Pandorans;	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 Senate's	 mistake.	 How	 many	 of	 his	 friends	 had	 he	 lost	 over	 these	 last	 few terrible	 months?	 Had	 they	 died	 fast	 or	 were	 they	 now	 suffering	 a	 fate	 far</p>
<p class="calibre1">worse..? </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	his	CO	continued	to	pump	them	up	for	the	critical	battle,	Chalmers'	head</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	filled	with	visions	of	row	upon	row	of	black-clad	soldiers.	A	white	emblem</p>
<p class="calibre1">resided	on	their	right	arms	and	left	breast,	an	all-encompassing	full	black	helmet</p>
<p class="calibre1">upon	 their	 heads,	 its	 smooth	 form	 negating	 all	 facial	 features.	 Two	 bright	 red oval	 spheres	 were	 set	 into	 an	 eye-level	 groove	 that	 ran	 all	 around,	 the	 “eyes” </p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves	slanted	into	a	menacing	and	intimidating	scowl.	One	of	the	soldiers</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned	to	face	him,	the	ruby-like	eyes	seeming	to	pierce	his	very	soul.	He	felt	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand	tighten	on	the	flight	helmet	he	held,	swallowing	hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Daniels!	 Peterson!	 Foster!	 Brown!	 Rye...”	 a	 voice	 called	 out	 above	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	 sounds	 that	 filled	 the	 flight	 deck.	 Feet	 moved	 and	 Chalmers	 felt	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">stomach	lurch.	His	name	would	be	called	soon.	He	felt	a	sense	of	doom.	If	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Empire	 could	 not	 stop	 the	 Enemy	 before,	 what	 hope	 did	 they	 have	 now?	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Enemy's	 power	 had	 grown	 exponentially	 and	 they	 had	 crushed	 everything	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	path	with	harrowing	little	effort.	Chalmers	was	feeling	forced	to	accept	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">truth:	they	were	all	that	was	left	of	the	Imperial	Naval	Forces.	This	was	a	battle</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	could	not	be	won;	not	now,	not	ever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“...	Tyler!	Flynn!	Chalmers!	King!	Golden!	Blair...” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>At	the	sound	of	his	name,	Chalmers	felt	himself	move	robotically,	his	mind screaming	in	protest	against	what	his	legs	were	doing.	He	ran	over	to	the	waiting</p>
<p class="calibre1">starfighter,	threw	on	his	helmet	and	begun	ascending	the	ladder	into	the	cockpit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zombie-like	 he	 sank	 down	 into	 the	 seat,	 watching	 as	 if	 from	 outside	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">body	 as	 his	 hands	 buckled	 him	 in,	 his	 fingers	 flip	 switches,	 press	 buttons, acknowledge	 questions	 and	 confirmations	 on	 the	 screens	 before	 him.	 Moments</p>
<p class="calibre1">later,	his	craft	was	taxied	to	the	catapult	and	before	long	he'd	found	himself	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	space	and	into	the	thick	of	battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 that	 moment,	 his	 worst	 fears	 had	 not	 only	 been	 altogether	 realised,	 but</p>
<p class="calibre1">far	exceeded. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Chalmers	 cancelled	 the	 radar	 calibration	 screen	 and	 instead	 opened	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">communications	channel	to	his	parent	carrier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Centaur</i>,	 this	 is	 First	 Lieutenant	 Chalmers.”	 He	 could	 hear	 the	 fear	 and tension	 in	 his	 own	 voice	 as	 he	 spoke	 and	 could	 not	 control	 it.	 “Has	 there	 been any	update	to	the	radar	situation?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	a	negative,	Chalmers,	we're	still	working	on	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Centaur</i>'s	answer	did	nothing	to	ease	his	distress.	“Any	contingency	plans? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	can't	see	what	the	hell	I'm	supposed	to	be	shooting	at	out	here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Again,	 that's	 a	 negative.	 Ops	 believes	 that	 enemy	 craft	 are	 masking	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">vessel	signatures.	We're	working	to	decode	it	ASAP.	We	will	keep	you	notified. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Centaur</i>	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chalmers	again	looked	down	at	his	radar	screen	in	frustration.	In	a	normal</p>
<p class="calibre1">combat	 situation	 the	 radar	 would	 differentiate	 between	 the	 participants	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">simple	colour	coding:	green	for	friendly,	red	for	hostile	and	white	for	unknown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	radar	had	been	functioning	as	normal	when	he	had	launched,	but	only	a	few</p>
<p class="calibre1">minutes	into	the	battle	every	item	on	the	screen	had	turned	green.	In	that	state	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	 it	 impossible	 to	 decipher	 hostile	 targets	 from	 friendly	 ones.	 To	 make</p>
<p class="calibre1">matters	worse,	his	opponents	were	flying	the	same	craft	as	he	and	his	squadron, </p>
<p class="calibre1">so	that	even	at	visual	range	he	could	not	be	certain	whether	he	was	about	to	open</p>
<p class="calibre1">fire	on	friend	or	foe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jules!”	 he	 said,	 opening	 a	 communications	 channel	 to	 a	 life	 long	 team</p>
<p class="calibre1">mate.	He	attempted	to	keep	his	voice	steady	as	he	spoke,	trying	his	best	to	avoid</p>
<p class="calibre1">drawing	any	of	his	allies	into	his	own	personal	hell.	“Is	your	radar	any	good?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jacques!”	the	familiar	female	voice	came	back	to	him,	sounding	grateful	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p12"></a>hear	from	a	friend.	“Where	are	you?	I'm	flying	blind	here!	I	can't	see	a	thing!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	anxiety	and	distress	was	clear	in	her	own	voice.	Chalmers	had	known	Jules</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	years,	she	was	almost	like	a	sister	to	him.	For	him	to	hear	her	in	such	a	state</p>
<p class="calibre1">horrified	him.	He	longed	to	open	a	video	link,	to	look	into	her	eyes	and	tell	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	everything	was	going	to	be	okay,	that	they	would	both	get	through	this.	But</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	his	fighter	in	its	current	state,	he	dared	not	touch	anything	for	fear	it	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	matters	worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he	 tried	 to	 think	 of	 how	 best	 to	 relay	 his	 present	 location	 to	 his	 team mate,	he	noticed	that	the	radar	had	tagged	the	craft	he	was	speaking	to;	a	thin, </p>
<p class="calibre1">blinking	white	rectangular	box	outlining	the	green	triangle.	For	a	brief	moment</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 anguish	 subsided	 and	 he	 brought	 his	 craft	 around	 to	 face	 Jules'	 fighter.	 He could	see	her	weaving	and	twirling	in	a	similar	fashion	to	his	own	meandering</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	confused	flight,	the	cannons	of	her	fighter	as	quiet	as	his	own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jules,	check	your	radar.	I'm...”	Chalmers	began.	Jules'	starfighter	exploded</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	 him,	 a	 pair	 of	 fighters	 peeling	 away	 from	 the	 wreckage	 that	 spread	 out like	 a	 firework.	 His	 small	 glimmer	 of	 hope	 melted	 as	 soon	 as	 it	 had	 first appeared	 and	 he	 felt	 the	 words	 he	 was	 about	 to	 speak	 become	 lodged	 in	 his throat.	 Though	 he	 had	 witnessed	 it	 so	 many	 times	 before,	 to	 see	 two	 fighters identical	 to	 his	 own	 open	 fire	 on	 and	 destroy	 an	 allied	 craft	 was	 still	 an	 awful sight	 to	 behold.	 It	 was	 not	 like	 combat	 against	 foreign	 craft,	 those	 of	 the Confederacy	 or	 Independent	 Nations,	 for	 instance.	 This	 was	 more	 personal,	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">though	 one	 was	 watching	 dear	 friends	 turn	 on	 each	 other	 again	 and	 again.	 For longer	than	was	wise	he	sat	staring	at	the	sparking,	spinning	metal	that	continued</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	spread	out.	Chalmers	took	it	as	sign	that	the	destruction	he	had	witnessed	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	last	few	months	was	edging	ever	closer	to	engulfing	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No...”	 the	 pitiful	 sound	 of	 his	 own	 voice	 finally	 escaped	 him.	 He	 felt	 his throat	 close	 up,	 but	 forced	 back	 the	 tears	 he	 could	 feel	 welling	 up	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">threatening	 to	 blur	 his	 vision.	 His	 fighter	 gave	 a	 heavy	 jolt	 as	 he	 was	 hit	 from behind	 and	 he	 banked	 hard,	 seeing	 a	 stream	 of	 bright	 green	 plasma	 streak	 past him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	the	wake	of	the	attack,	he	tried	to	think.	He	could	wheel	around	and	go</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	 the	 closest	 craft	 to	 him,	 hoping	 that	 he	 was	 opening	 fire	 on	 a	 hostile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,	he	risked	killing	a	friend	who	had	assumed	that	 <i class="calibre4">he</i>	was	the	Enemy.	A</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice	from	his	comms	system	drew	his	attention, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	available	support,	this	is	 <i class="calibre4">Minotaur</i>.	 We	 are	 sustaining	 heavy	 damage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Requesting	immediate	assistance!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chalmers	 felt	 the	 panic	 rising	 further	 within	 him	 and	 fought	 to	 control	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">INF	 Minotaur</i>	 was	 the	 Imperial	 flagship;	 a	 symbol	 of	 the	 Empire's	 glory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Historically,	 its	 very	 presence	 within	 a	 conflict	 zone	 was	 enough	 to	 spur	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>Imperial	 combatants	 on	 to	 victory.	 But	 a	 desperate	 request	 for	 help	 from	 the great	 battleship	 could	 only	 lower	 morale.	 He	 could	 not	 allow	 such	 a	 thing	 to happen.	 He	 pushed	 recent	 events	 behind	 him	 and	 looked	 around	 for	 the	 great</p>
<p class="calibre1">capital	ship.	Even	though	he	could	not	identify	it	on	the	cluttered	mess	of	green</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	was	his	radar,	its	sheer	size	meant	that	he	would	have	no	trouble	locating	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 his	 own	 two	 eyes.	 He	 saw	 it	 hanging	 high	 above	 the	 planet	 Kethlan;	 the former	Seat	of	the	Emperor	and	the	planet	where	he	himself	had	been	born. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	changed	his	heading,	raising	his	velocity	to	maximum	and	sped	forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	 at	 this	 distance	 he	 could	 make	 out	 the	 explosions	 ripping	 across	 the	 hull, blooming	 before	 dissipating.  <i class="calibre4">Minotaur's</i>	 laser	 and	 plasma	 cannons	 were	 firing indiscriminatingly	in	all	directions,	whilst	volleys	of	return	fire	impacted	further</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	its	surface,	the	battleship's	shielding	all	but	destroyed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	drew	closer	to	the	once	proud	symbol	of	Imperial	might,	he	came	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">realise	 that	 he	 was	 looking	 at	 the	 future.	 The	 official	 line	 from	 the	 Empire	 to their	galactic	neighbours	was	that	they	were	entrenched	in	a	civil	war.	To	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">within	the	Imperium	itself	the	truth	was	far	more	shocking.	Over	three	quarters</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	Imperial	armed	forces	had	so	far	been	defeated,	more	than	a	dozen	of	its</p>
<p class="calibre1">star	systems	having	fallen	to	the	Enemy.	Unless	they	could	halt	the	advances	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 Enemy	 here	 and	 now,	 it	 would	 not	 be	 long	 before	 the	 Imperium	 was	 lost forever,	 confined	 to	 the	 annals	 of	 time;	 and	 then	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 galaxy	 would follow.	 He	 wondered	 if	 the	 true	 story	 had	 come	 out,	 whether	 the	 Independent Worlds	or	the	Confederacy	had	seen	through	their	spin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though	it	had	taken	him	longer	than	he	wanted,	even	at	full	speed,	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">within	 visual	 range	 of	 other	 fighter	 craft.	 As	 he	 entered	 the	 thick	 of	 combat,	 it dawned	on	him	that	he	did	not	need	his	radar	any	more;	he	had	only	to	aim	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	craft	that	was	firing	upon	 <i class="calibre4">Minotaur</i>.	He	could	see	several	dozen	starfighters attempting	 to	 tackle	  <i class="calibre4">Minotaur's</i>	 attackers,	 their	 work	 cut	 out	 as	 they	 struggled against	 the	 far	 greater	 numbers	 of	 heavier	 fighters	 the	 Enemy	 flew.	 The	 lightly armed	 and	 shielded	 Jackals	 that	 he	 and	 his	 team	 mates	 piloted	 were	 almost	 all that	 remained	 of	 their	 complement,	 the	 majority	 of	 their	 own	 heavy-class</p>
<p class="calibre1">fighters	having	been	destroyed	in	combat	months	earlier.	Though	the	Jackal	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">faster	than	the	other	starfighters	and	able	to	out-manoeuvre	them,	Chalmers	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">aware	that	in	his	current	state	of	shattered	nerves	he	would	need	a	lot	of	luck	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	wanted	to	exploit	such	capabilities	to	his	advantage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Picking	 out	 a	 target	 the	 Imperial	 fighter	 pilot	 aligned	 himself	 with	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">aggressor	and	opened	fire.	The	shots	sailed	harmlessly	past	their	target,	leaving</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chalmers	 to	 curse	 and	 attempt	 to	 calm	 himself	 down	 so	 that	 he	 could	 aim</p>
<p class="calibre1">straight.	His	right	hand	was	shaking.	He	took	hold	of	it	in	his	other	and	flexed</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 fingers.	 He	 tried	 to	 convince	 himself	 it	 was	 still	 possible	 that	 the	 Imperial</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>forces	might	all	somehow	get	through	this,	that	they	would	secure	a	victory	here today;	that	they	could	at	last	turn	the	tide	and	the	nightmare	that	had	started	five</p>
<p class="calibre1">years	ago	would	end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 steady	 bleeping	 from	 his	 on-board	 computer	 system	 dragged	 him	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 dreams	 of	 hope.	 He	 recognised	 the	 sound	 as	 the	 lock	 warning	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">instinctively	 looked	 to	 his	 radar	 for	 the	 location	 and	 speed	 of	 the	 incoming threat.	 At	 the	 same	 time	 that	 he	 remembered	 his	 radar	 was	 useless	 to	 him,	 an explosion	rocked	his	fighter,	the	sound	of	the	missile	lock	warning	cutting	out,	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 replaced	 by	 another,	 far	 more	 urgent	 tone.	 Though	 having	 rarely	 heard	 it before,	 Chalmers	 knew	 just	 what	 it	 meant.	 His	 starfighter's	 speed	 dropped	 off and	 the	 craft	 began	 to	 tumble,	 the	 engines	 no	 longer	 functional.	 Both	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">computer	screens	were	flashing	the	word	“EJECT”. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chalmers	reached	up	for	the	ejection	control,	his	fingers	wrapping	around</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	handle.	But	he	stopped	short	of	pulling	it,	turning	his	attention	once	more	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	scene	outside.	Bright	green	bolts	of	plasma	flew	in	every	direction;	thick	red, </p>
<p class="calibre1">yellow	 and	 blue	 pulsing	 lines	 of	 various	 beam	 weapons	 sweeping	 around</p>
<p class="calibre1">elsewhere;	trails	from	missiles	curling	about	the	chaos	as	they	hunted	down	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">targets.	 Fighter	 craft	 circled	  <i class="calibre4">Minotaur</i>,	 continuing	 to	 open	 fire	 on	 the	 stricken battleship	and	each	other.  <i class="calibre4">Minotaur's</i>	cannons	were	silent.	He	knew	it	was	only	a matter	of	time	before	it	was	completely	destroyed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">From	 the	 bridge	 of	 the	 Imperial	 carrier,  <i class="calibre4">INF	 Chimera</i>,	 Fleet	 Admiral	 Zackaria watched	 the	 last	 minutes	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Minotaur's</i>	 service	 to	 the	 Imperium	 unmoved.	 The destruction	 of	 the	 enormous	 battleship	 and	 the	 tremendous	 loss	 of	 life	 brought him	 no	 sadness	 nor	 regret.	 He	 turned	 to	 his	 second	 in	 command	 and	 spoke	 to him	in	a	strange	tongue.  <i class="calibre4">Minotaur</i>	was	lost;	it	was	useless	to	them.	Let	it	burn.	If they	 could	 not	 have	 this	 battleship,	 then	 they	 would	 just	 acquire	 another.	 One that	was	not	so	fragile;	one	that	reflected	the	majesty	of	the	Imperium;	one	that</p>

<p class="calibre1">Commodore	 Rissard	 spoke	 his	 understanding	 of	 the	 admiral's	 request	 and</p>

<p class="calibre1">screens	were	still	flashing	their	suggested	course	of	action,	Chalmers	knew	there</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">N</b>early	six	months	had	passed	since	Chalmers'	death,	the	fall	of	Kethlan	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">destruction	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Minotaur</i>;	 and	 on	 the	 other	 side	 of	 the	 known	 galaxy,	 Simon Dodds	 was	 awoken	 by	 the	 sound	 of	 someone,	 or	 something,	 thumping	 on	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">porch	door	of	his	parents'	house.	At	first,	he	thought	that	the	three	loud	thuds	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	the	result	of	the	unlocked	front	door	banging	in	the	wind.	Glancing	out	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	bedroom	window,	however,	he	saw	the	branches	of	the	apple	trees	standing</p>
<p class="calibre1">peaceful	 and	 serene	 in	 the	 moonlight	 of	 the	 cloudless	 night.	 Ignoring	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">disturbance,	he	turned	over	to	catch	some	more	sleep	before	the	inevitable	onset</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	his	father's	daily	routine	of	dragging	him	out	of	bed	to	help	work	the	fields,	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">deal	 with	 the	 orchards'	 tedious	 administration.	 Despite	 the	 fact	 that	 Simon	 was only	staying	with	his	parents	for	a	short	time	-	if	one	could	count	six	months	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">short	 -	 his	 father	 was	 not	 about	 to	 permit	 him	 free	 food	 and	 lodgings	 without making	 him	 pull	 his	 weight.	 Maybe	 today	 he	 could	 try	 disappearing	 into	 town and	hiding	out	in	a	bar	for	a	few	hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	just	shut	his	eyes	again	when	another	two	thuds	came	from	below, </p>
<p class="calibre1">followed	 by	 the	 unmistakable	 sound	 of	 a	 man's	 distressed	 voice	 crying	 out	 for attention.	It	was	followed	by	the	sound	of	loud,	uneven	feet	clumping	down	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">porch	steps	and	then	scraping	up	the	well-worn	dirt	track	leading	away	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	 more	 or	 less	 awake,	 Simon	 took	 a	 look	 at	 his	 bedside	 clock.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">illuminated	 green	 numbers	 informed	 him	 that	 it	 was	 just	 past	 four	 thirty;	 too early	for	any	of	the	orchard's	hired	help	to	be	turning	up.	With	great	reluctance</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	threw	back	the	covers	and	pulled	himself	out	of	bed,	making	his	way	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">window.	His	bedroom	was	located	at	the	front	of	the	house,	more	or	less	above</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 front	 door.	 He	 shoved	 the	 window	 all	 the	 way	 open	 and	 leaned	 out	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">investigate	 the	 source	 of	 the	 noise,	 which	 had	 since	 ceased.	 No	 sooner	 had	 he stuck	his	head	out	the	window	when	he	spotted	a	figure	sprawled	on	the	ground, </p>
<p class="calibre1">halfway	 up	 the	 track.	 He	 leaned	 further	 out	 and	 took	 a	 quick	 look	 around	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>surrounding	 area.	 Seeing	 no-one	 aside	 from	 the	 body,	 he	 drew	 back	 inside, turned	around	and	gave	a	start. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	 is	 it?”	 his	 father	 asked	 him.	 Gregory	 Dodds,	 also	 awoken	 by	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">commotion,	 had	 wandered	 into	 his	 son's	 bedroom.	 Simon	 noticed	 that	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">clutched	 a	 shotgun	 in	 one	 hand,	 no	 doubt	 in	 preparation	 for	 whomever	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">believed	 was	 attempting	 to	 break	 into	 their	 property;	 it	 wouldn't	 have	 been	 the first	time.	His	father	had	already	activated	the	weapon,	a	digital	counter	towards</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	rear	of	the	gun	gently	illuminating	the	man's	chest	with	a	soft	blue	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There's	someone	outside,”	Simon	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Halfway	up	the	track,	face	down	in	the	dirt.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon's	father	shoved	past	to	see	for	himself	and,	just	as	Simon	had	done, </p>
<p class="calibre1">took	a	quick	glance	around	to	see	if	there	was	anyone	else	about.	Satisfied	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 figure	 was	 the	 only	 probable	 source	 of	 the	 disturbance	 that	 had	 woken	 the family,	he	turned	once	more	to	his	son. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We'll	 go	 and	 have	 a	 look.	 I'll	 have	 your	 mother	 get	 ready	 to	 call	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">police.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon	 nodded	 in	 agreement.	 “Here,”	 he	 said,	 reaching	 out	 to	 take	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shotgun	from	his	father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 father	 pulled	 back,	 pushing	 Simon's	 hand	 away	 from	 the	 weapon	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">giving	him	a	distrustful	look.	“You've	got	to	be	joking!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	not	going	to	shoot	you	in	the	back,	Dad,”	Simon	said.	“You've	got	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">start	trusting	me	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	put	some	clothes	on,”	Gregory	answered,	leaving	Simon's	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon	 pulled	 on	 the	 previous	 day's	 clothes,	 that	 he	 picked	 up	 off	 a	 chair, and	laced	up	some	boots	before	joining	his	father	on	the	upstairs	landing.	By	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">appearances	 his	 father	 had	 made	 a	 similar	 decision	 with	 his	 attire	 and	 the	 pair made	their	way	down	the	stairs	and	opened	the	front	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	figure	in	the	dirt	remained	motionless.	Leaving	his	father	to	guard	the	front</p>
<p class="calibre1">door,	Simon	hurried	up	the	track	and	knelt	down	next	to	the	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,”	he	said,	giving	the	man	a	gentle	shake	about	the	shoulder.	The	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">let	out	a	groan	and	Simon	wondered	if	he	was	a	drunkard	who	had	staggered	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 house,	 searching	 for	 a	 place	 to	 sleep.	 He	 then	 discovered	 that	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">unpleasant,	sticky	wetness	he	felt	on	his	hand	was	not	vomit	or	alcohol;	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He's	 hurt!”	 Simon	 called	 to	 his	 father,	 looking	 at	 the	 blood	 and	 dirt	 that clung	to	his	fingers.	His	father	quickened	his	step,	joining	his	son	by	the	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon	 became	 aware	 of	 the	 man's	 attire	 and	 realised	 that	 he	 was	 wearing	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhat	loose	fitting	Confederation	Stellar	Navy	flight	suit.	He	rolled	the	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	 onto	 his	 back	 carefully,	 discovering	 the	 front	 of	 the	 suit	 to	 be	 torn	 and bloody. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	of	your	bloody	lot,”	his	father	muttered,	kneeling	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks	 like	 he's	 been	 shot,”	 Simon	 said.	 Even	 though	 it	 was	 still	 before</p>
<p class="calibre1">sunrise,	he	was	able	to	make	out	the	dark	patches	of	blood	glistening	on	the	suit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	wounded	man's	eyes	fluttered	open	and	his	gaze	fell	upon	the	two	that	knelt</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	 him.	 He	 tried	 to	 speak,	 but	 the	 effort	 seemed	 too	 great,	 only	 a	 whisper escaping	his	lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	 you	 okay?”	 Simon	 asked,	 speaking	 in	 a	 loud	 and	 clear	 voice.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	gave	him	no	response,	his	eyes	starting	to	close	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	 you	 stand?”	 Gregory	 asked,	 but	 there	 was	 no	 reply.	 “Let's	 get	 him</p>
<p class="calibre1">inside	the	house,”	he	suggested.	Simon	watched	as	he	trotted	back	up	the	worn</p>
<p class="calibre1">track	to	relieve	himself	of	the	shotgun,	before	returning	to	his	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ready?”	Gregory	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ready.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon	 lifted	 the	 man	 under	 the	 arms,	 his	 father	 taking	 his	 legs,	 the	 pair</p>
<p class="calibre1">ignoring	the	groans	from	their	unexpected	guest.	They	made	it	back	to	the	house, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon	 noticing	 for	 the	 first	 time	 the	 dark	 red	 bloodstains	 on	 the	 outside	 of	 the door	where	the	man	had	thumped	on	the	white	painted	wood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	God!”	Simon's	mother	breathed	as	they	struggled	through	the	door	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">carried	 the	 man	 into	 the	 living	 room.	 She	 had	 pulled	 on	 a	 thin	 dressing	 gown over	 her	 night	 dress.	 She	 was	 a	 tall	 woman,	 with	 blonde	 hair	 and,	 at	 this moment,	a	shocked	expression.	A	cat,	that	had	been	enjoying	a	blissful	doze	on	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">chair,	 lifted	 its	 head	 and	 then	 shrank	 back	 as	 it	 saw	 the	 stranger	 in	 the	 men's arms.	 It	 jumped	 down	 from	 its	 resting	 place	 and	 darted	 out	 the	 room,	 past	 the three	men,	the	bell	on	its	collar	tinkling	as	it	went. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sally,	shotgun's	just	inside	the	porch,	could	you	fetch	it	inside?”	Gregory</p>
<p class="calibre1">said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He's	 been	 shot,”	 Simon	 added	 as	 he	 and	 his	 father	 deposited	 the	 heavily</p>
<p class="calibre1">breathing	 man	 onto	 the	 couch.	 Sally	 did	 as	 Gregory	 requested,	 bringing	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shotgun	inside	and	propping	it	up	against	a	wall	in	the	hallway,	the	ammunition</p>
<p class="calibre1">counter	projecting	a	blue	hue	onto	a	small	spot	on	the	wooden	floor	where	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">placed.	 Sally	 moaned	 as	 she	 saw	 where	 the	 two	 men	 had	 set	 the	 man	 who	 had woken	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>“Greg,	you're	going	to	get	blood	all	over	the	couch,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	we	can't	exactly	just	dump	him	on	the	ground,”	Gregory	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon	noted	a	couple	of	splotches	of	blood	on	the	wooden	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	need	to	get	him	comfortable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	is	he?	Where	did	he	come	from?”	Sally	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He's	CSN,	Mum,”	Simon	said.	“Do	you	know	where	the	first-aid	kit	is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hello?	Can	you	hear	me?	What's	your	name?”	Gregory	was	still	trying	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	a	response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	 “Dean”,	 Dad,	 it	 says	 so	 on	 his	 suit,”	 Simon	 said,	 pointing	 out	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lettering	 on	 the	 left	 breast	 beneath	 the	 squadron	 logo.	 “Mum,	 first-aid?	 He's bleeding	 pretty	 badly,”	 Simon	 prompted	 his	 mother	 who	 was	 staring	 at	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">injured	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'll	call	an	ambulance,”	Sally	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	you	can	call	one	of	your	friends	at	the	Navy	straight	after,”	Gregory</p>
<p class="calibre1">added	to	Simon.	“There's	got	to	be	a	number	for	this	sort	of	thing,	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“N...	 No!	 Don't!”	 the	 stranger	 named	 Dean	 cried	 out,	 looking	 around	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">who	was	speaking.	The	three	jumped	at	his	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	need	medical	treatment.	We	have	to	get	you	to	a	hospital	or	a	doctor,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sally	said,	looking	about	the	living	room.	“Where's	the	handset?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	handset?”	Gregory	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	the	phone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don't	 know.	 It's	 probably	 fallen	 down	 the	 back	 of	 the	 couch	 again.	 Just use	the	video	screen	in	the	hall.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No...	no	doctors!	 No	Navy!”	Dean	 protested,	finding	the	 strength	to	talk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let...	let	me	stay...	here!	Please!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	calm	down,”	Simon	said.	“You're	in	shock.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dean	looked	quite	distressed	as	Sally	left	the	living	room	and	walked	out	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	view,	his	breathing	becoming	erratic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where's	the	first-aid?”	Simon	asked	his	father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	mother	knows,”	Gregory	answered.	“We'll	get	it	after	she's	called	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ambulance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Simon,”	the	young	man	heard	his	mother	call	from	out	in	the	hall.	He	left</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 father	 with	 Dean	 and	 found	 his	 mother	 floundering	 in	 front	 of	 the	 video phone	 that	 hung	 on	 the	 wall.	 “I	 can't	 remember	 how	 we	 do	 this.	 That's	 why	 I wanted	to	use	the	handset	instead	of	this	stupid	thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	 tap	 the	 screen	 anywhere	 and	 then	 press	 the	 “Emergency	 Services” </p>
<p class="calibre1">icon,”	Simon	prompted.	He	positioned	himself	within	the	doorway	of	the	living</p>
<p class="calibre1">room,	so	that	he	could	both	keep	an	eye	on	their	guest	and	jump	in	to	assist	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother	should	she	need	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>Sally	 tapped	 the	 touch-sensitive	 screen	 to	 bring	 the	 phone	 out	 of	 its	 sleep state,	the	device	lighting	up	and	displaying	icons	and	options.	She	stabbed	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Emergency	Services”	icon	and	hugged	at	herself	as	the	screen	informed	her	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">video	 phone	 was	 connecting.	 Before	 long,	 it	 did	 so.	 From	 his	 skewed	 angle	 of the	screen,	Simon	could	just	make	out	the	headset	wearing	blonde	woman	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">answered	the	call. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	service	do	you	require?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ambulance,”	 Sally	 said,	 then	 hastened	 to	 add,	 “we've	 got	 a	 man	 here</p>
<p class="calibre1">suffering	from	gunshot	wounds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	 his	 condition?”	 The	 woman's	 fingers	 tapped	 away	 at	 an	 unseen</p>
<p class="calibre1">device. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He's	bleeding	quite	heavily.	Not	sure	how	many	times	he	was	shot,	but	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">can't	walk	and	can	barely	speak.	We	had	to	carry	him	into	the	living	room	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">outside	the	house.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	the	wounds	the	result	of	a	projectile	or	energy	weapon?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I...	er...	I	don't...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	there	any	burn	marks?	If	it	was	an	energy	weapon	then	in	most	cases</p>
<p class="calibre1">you'd	be	able	to	smell	the	burnt	clothes	and	wounds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sally	glanced	over	to	Simon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bullets,	Mum,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bullets,”	Sally	repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	 thank	 you,”	 the	 operator	 confirmed,	 maintaining	 her	 calm.	 Simon</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	see	his	mother	ringing	at	her	dressing	grown	quite	hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Has	he	been	shot	in	the	arms,	legs,	torso,	or	head?”	the	woman	wanted	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“His	body.	The	chest,	it	looks	like.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 woman	 at	 the	 emergency	 services	 tapped	 away	 and	 then	 paused, </p>
<p class="calibre1">looking	down	at	something	for	a	few	moments,	a	curious	expression	on	her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Could	 you	 hold	 the	 line	 for	 a	 minute,	 please?	 Thank	 you.”	 Her	 image</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappeared,	to	be	replaced	with	the	medical	services	logo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Simon,	she's	just	hung	up,”	Sally	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	sure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	 gone	 back	 to	 this,”	 Sally	 indicated	 the	 logo	 occupying	 the	 display. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon	 was	 about	 to	 start	 over	 to	 investigate,	 when	 the	 operator	 who	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">answered	the	call	re-appeared	on	the	screen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Could	 you	 confirm	 your	 name	 and	 address?”	 she	 requested.	 Sally	 did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	good.	Someone	will	be	with	you	within	the	next	thirty	or	forty	minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	 listen	 carefully:	 please	 don't	 move	 the	 victim	 since	 you	 could	 cause	 him additional	trauma.	The	bullets	may	have	missed	vital	organs,	so	we	don't	want	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>do	anything	that	could	result	in	further	injury.	The	biggest	risk	to	their	life	will come	from	loss	of	blood.	If	you	are	able,	dress	the	wounds	and	try	to	stem	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">blood	loss.	It	could	make	the	difference	between	life	and	death.	Don't	move	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	house	or	attempt	to	bring	him	to	us	yourself.”	The	operator	hung	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sally	swore	and	came	back	into	the	living	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	wrong?”	Gregory	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They're	not	going	to	be	here	for	another	thirty	minutes,	at	least.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thirty	minutes?”	Gregory	said,	horrified. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">At	least</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We'll	have	to	take	him	ourselves,”	Simon	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 they	 said	 not	 to	 move	 him,	 it	 could	 make	 things	 worse,”	 Sally	 said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wringing	 her	 hands.	 “We're	 going	 to	 have	 to	 do	 the	 best	 we	 can	 for	 him	 until they	get	here.	I'll	find	a	first-aid	kit.	Simon	can	you	call	the	Navy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	he	said	not	to,”	Simon	said,	shaking	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	mother	stared	at	him	in	disbelief	for	a	second.	“Simon...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	can't.	He	asked	us	not	to	contact	them.	Didn't	you	hear	him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Simon,	don't	talk	to	your	mother	that	way,”	Gregory	said,	a	scowl	on	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	just	following	protocol,	Dad,”	Simon	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gregory	 glared	 at	 his	 son.	 “Oh,	 so	  <i class="calibre4">now</i>	 you	 decide	 that	 it's	 time	 to	 start doing	as	you're	told...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	always	do	as	I'm	told.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	could've	fooled	me...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	 for	 God's	 sake,	 stop	 it	 you	 two,	 just	 stop	 it!”	 Sally	 said.	 “Don't	 start having	  <i class="calibre4">that</i>	 conversation	 again,	 especially	 now.	 I've	 heard	 it	 every	 day	 for	 the last	five	months.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	just	trying	to	do	the	right	thing,”	Simon	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	why	couldn't	you	have	done	the	right	thing	 <i class="calibre4">then</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 was	 an	  <i class="calibre4">accident</i>,	 Mum.	 Those	 people	 were	 just	 there.	 It's	 not	 as	 if	 I decided	 to	 shoot	 them	 all	 on	 purpose.	 I	 didn't	 go	 out	 of	 my	 way	 to	 take	 their lives.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 now	 you're	 just	 going	 to	 let	 it	 happen	 here	 instead,”	 Sally	 said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">choking	 back	 tears	 and	 pushing	 past	 Simon,	 leaving	 the	 living	 room	 and	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">three	 men	 behind	 her.	 Simon	 watched	 as	 she	 walked	 in	 the	 direction	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">kitchen	 and	 began	 pulling	 things	 out	 of	 cupboards	 in	 a	 search	 for	 sufficient medical	supplies.	He	began	to	start	after	his	distressed	mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Simon,	wait	there	a	moment,”	his	father	called.	Simon	turned	back	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">scene	 in	 the	 living	 room,	 watching	 his	 father	 undoing	 Dean's	 flight	 suit	 and trying	 to	 get	 a	 better	 look	 at	 his	 injuries.	 The	 extent	 of	 the	 damage	 was	 clear</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>even	before	the	white	vest	Dean	wore	beneath	the	suit	was	pulled	up.	Two	dark holes	 were	 prominent	 in	 Dean's	 chest,	 blood	 still	 seeping	 out	 with	 each	 breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gregory	stood	and	walked	over	to	Simon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	doesn't	this	guy	want	us	to	call	an	ambulance	or	the	Navy?”	Gregory</p>
<p class="calibre1">asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon	 shrugged.	 “It's	 possible	 that	 he's	 involved	 in	 some	 kind	 of	 covert</p>
<p class="calibre1">operation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Covert?”	 His	 father	 screwed	 up	 his	 face.	 “You	 mean	 he's	 meant	 to	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">doing	something	in	secret?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	Or	with	very	little	exposure.	Whatever	it	is,	he	doesn't	want	certain</p>
<p class="calibre1">people	 within	 the	 Navy	 finding	 out	 about	 it.”	 Simon	 looked	 at	 Dean,	 who	 was still	taking	heavy	gasps	of	air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well	what	does	he	expect	 <i class="calibre4">us</i>	to	do	with	him?”	Gregory	asked	in	somewhat</p>
<p class="calibre1">accusing	tones.	Gregory	studied	the	man	for	a	moment.	“Do	you	know	him?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	 Simon	 shook	 his	 head.	 “I've	 never	 seen	 him	 before	 in	 my	 life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Honest,”	 he	 added,	 seeing	 the	 unconvinced	 look	 his	 father	 gave	 him.	 They</p>
<p class="calibre1">returned	to	Dean	and	knelt	down	next	to	the	couch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks	 like	 he's	 been	 shot	 in	 the	 chest	 and	 shoulders.	 You	 stay	 here	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.	 I'll	 help	 your	 mother	 find	 some	 bandages	 and	 something	 to	 plug	 up	 the wounds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dean	 was	 staring	 up	 at	 the	 ceiling	 and	 breathing	 hard,	 struggling	 to	 catch</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	breath.	Simon	decided	to	try	and	discover	what	had	happened	whilst	he	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don't	 worry,	 mate,	 everything's	 going	 to	 be	 okay.	 You'll	 just	 have	 a	 few</p>
<p class="calibre1">scars	to	show	your	friends.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dean	said	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Confederation	 Stellar	 Navy,	 eh?	 I'm	 in	 the	 service	 myself,	 although	 it's	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	complicated	right	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Just	 in	 case	 you're	 wondering	 why	 a	 twenty-nine-year-old	 is	 still	 living	 at</i> <i class="calibre4">home	with	his	mum	and	dad</i>,	Simon	thought	to	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dean	still	said	nothing,	his	eyes	remaining	fixed	on	the	ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Yellow	Dogs</i>?”	 Simon	 noted	 the	 emblem	 of	 a	 cartoon	 dog,	 tongue	 lolling from	 its	 mouth,	 on	 the	 outside	 of	 Dean's	 flight	 suit.	 “Not	 heard	 of	 you	 guys.	 I usually	fly	with	the	 <i class="calibre4">White	Knights</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	Simon's	words,	Dean	turned	his	head	to	look	at	the	young	man,	his	eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">filled	with	anguish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A...	TAF...	ject...”	he	tried,	the	effort	of	speaking	appearing	quite	great. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	 Simon	 drew	 closer.	 “Say	 that	 again.”	 Simon	 could	 hear	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother's	distressed	voice	carrying	through	from	the	kitchen	as	she	spoke	to	his</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>father,	evidently	quite	upset	by	what	she	had	been	dragged	into. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“...	you	don't	know	who's	done	this	to	him.	They	could	come	around	here</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking	for	him,”	she	was	saying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	didn't	see	anyone	else	outside,”	Gregory	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	how	did	he	get	here?	Did	he	drive?	Where's	his	car?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He's	a	pilot.	Maybe	he	parachuted?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	where	was	his	parachute?	Where	did	his	plane	or	whatever	it	was	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">down?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	know,	Sal.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	don't	even	know	if	he	is	who	he	says	he	is.	For	all	we	know,	he	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	one	of	those	terrorists	from	Mitikas.	You	know	how	it	starts	-	they	come	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">here	one	by	one	and	then	start	blowing	each	other	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 a	 clatter	 and	 then	 a	 heavy	 crash,	 followed	 by	 cursing	 from	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	man	is	going	to	die	unless	he	gets	to	a	hospital.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon	 forced	 himself	 to	 filter	 out	 the	 rest.	 He	 was	 intent	 on	 discovering</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	 had	 happened	 to	 Dean	 and	 how	 he	 had	 come	 to	 be	 there.	 The	 wounded</p>
<p class="calibre1">pilot	reached	out	and	placed	a	limp	hand	on	his	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A...	T..	AF...	operation...”	the	man	tried	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	ejected	from	your	TAF?”	Simon	asked,	trying	to	make	sense	of	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dean	 was	 saying.	 If	 he'd	 ejected	 from	 his	 TAF	 how	 did	 he	 get	 all	 those	 bullet wounds?	Had	someone	managed	to	shoot	him	while	he	sat	in	the	cockpit?	That</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn't	 make	 any	 sense.	 Bullets	 would	 have	 a	 hard	 time	 getting	 through	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">toughened	canopy,	let	alone	the	energy	shields	surrounding	the	fighter.	“Where</p>
<p class="calibre1">did	you	come	down?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 started	 coughing	 and	 took	 another	 deep	 breath.	 “Imperial	 war... </p>
<p class="calibre1">wrong...”	was	all	he	could	manage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon	didn't	know	what	he	was	talking	about.	The	Imperial	civil	war	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrong?	 Of	 course	 it	 was,	 lots	 of	 people	 had	 lost	 their	 lives	 in	 that	 unending conflict.	Dean	was	making	very	little	sense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,	 Simon,	 give	 me	 a	 hand	 here.”	 Gregory	 reappeared	 in	 the	 living</p>
<p class="calibre1">room,	 carrying	 a	 small	 red	 first-aid	 box	 and	 a	 much	 larger	 medical	 kit.	 He dumped	them	both	on	the	floor	at	the	foot	of	the	couch	and	together	the	pair	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 best	 to	 bandage	 the	 man,	 but	 they	 both	 knew	 that	 he	 would	 die	 without proper	medical	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Simon	bandaged	the	bullet	wounds	in	the	man's	chest,	in	a	futile	attempt</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 stem	 the	 flow	 of	 blood,	 he	 noticed	 his	 mother	 in	 the	 doorway.	 She	 was	 still distressed	 and	 he	 could	 make	 out	 the	 tears	 sliding	 down	 her	 face.	 He	 was	 well aware	of	what	she	must	have	been	thinking:	one	day	it	might	be	her	son	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>same	position,	being	patched	up	by	friends,	or	strangers,	as	they	did	their	best	to prolong	his	life	for	what	might	well	prove	to	be	only	a	few	minutes.	He	smiled</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	at	her,	to	let	her	know	it	would	be	okay.	Following	naval	protocol	or	not,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	 regretted	 the	 way	 he	 had	 spoken	 to	 her.	 Dean	 could	 not	 have	 been	 much older	than	himself,	something	which	had	likely	compounded	her	anguish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	wounded	pilot	never	took	his	eyes	off	Simon	as	he	and	his	father	tried</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	make	him	comfortable	and	stable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Sudarberg</i>,”	Dean	said	all	of	a	sudden,	still	staring	at	Simon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 did	 he	 say?”	 Gregory	 asked,	 the	 two	 men	 ceasing	 their	 messy</p>
<p class="calibre1">bandaging	to	listen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Sudarberg</i>?”	Simon	asked,	leaning	closer	to	Dean. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Y...	yes.	Stay...	a..	aw..	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where's	 <i class="calibre4">Sudarberg</i>?”	Gregory	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	know,	I've	never	heard	of	it.	Where's	 <i class="calibre4">Sudarberg</i>?	Why	should	I	stay</p>
<p class="calibre1">away	from	it?”	Dean	didn't	answer,	but	panted,	struggling	to	swallow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 guy	 is	 going	 to	 die	 unless	 we	 can	 get	 him	 to	 a	 hospital	 soon,”	 his father	 remarked.	 Simon	 looked	 over	 their	 attempts	 to	 preserve	 the	 man's	 life, their	 efforts	 far	 poorer	 than	 what	 he	 had	 originally	 envisioned.	 Whilst	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">medical	kits	contained	a	number	of	dressings,	bandages	and	solutions	designed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 stimulate	 rapid	 coagulation,	 they	 were	 not	 enough	 to	 contend	 with	 Dean's</p>
<p class="calibre1">kinds	 of	 injuries,	 nor	 his	 sustained	 blood	 loss.	 They	 persevered	 for	 a	 while longer	until	Gregory	threw	in	the	towel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,	Simon,	call	your	friends	at	the	Navy,”	Gregory	said.	“We've	been	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	for	ages	now	and	that	ambulance	could	still	take	quite	a	while	to	get	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Navy	might	be	able	to	get	here	quicker.	Whatever	this	guy	is	worried	about, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm	sure	its	not	worth	dying	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon	conceded	to	what	his	father	was	saying	and,	pushing	protocol	aside, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 made	 the	 call.	 He	 then	 sat	 with	 Dean,	 attempting	 to	 get	 a	 little	 more</p>
<p class="calibre1">information	out	of	him	whilst	they	waited	for	help	to	arrive.	But	Dean	was	done</p>
<p class="calibre1">talking	and	less	than	twenty	minutes	later	he	was	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	 exactly	 did	 you	 find	 him?”	 a	 representative	 of	 the	 Naval	 Investigation Services	 was	 asking	 the	 Dodds	 family.	 It	 was	 quite	 late	 in	 the	 morning	 and several	men	and	women	were	carrying	out	final	investigations	of	the	perimeter</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 family	 home.	 The	 ambulance	 that	 had	 been	 called	 had	 never	 arrived. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>Instead,	a	military	medical	transport	had	showed	up,	a	number	of	heavily	armed personnel	 accompanying	 the	 medical	 team	 into	 the	 house.	 In	 addition,	 a	 large area	around	the	house	and	orchards	had	been	sealed	off,	the	workers	arriving	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	orchard	being	turned	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 was	 lying	 there,	 face	 down	 on	 the	 ground,”	 Gregory	 said,	 pointing	 at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 spot	 where	 they	 had	 found	 Dean.	 “How	 much	 longer	 is	 this	 going	 to	 take? </p>
<p class="calibre1">You've	been	here	for	bloody	hours.	I've	got	pickers	and	harvesters	waiting	to	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	work.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	just	need	to	ensure	I	have	all	the	details	down,	Mr	Dodds,”	the	rep	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">tapping	 away	 at	 a	 hand	 held	 device	 with	 a	 stylus.	 “After	 you	 found	 him,	 what did	you	do	next?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	the	love	of	God,	are	you	deaf?”	Simon's	father	glowered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dad,	 don't	 worry,	 I'll	 deal	 with	 this,”	 Simon	 said,	 seeing	 his	 father's	 last thread	of	patience	about	to	snap.	“Go	and	check	that	they're	not	destroying	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">house.”	 His	 mother	 and	 father	 departed	 and	 Simon	 turned	 back	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">representative.	 “We	 brought	 him	 inside	 and	 called	 for	 an	 ambulance.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">medical	services	told	us	it	would	be	over	half	an	hour	before	they	could	get	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">us,	so	we	attempted	to	patch	him	up	ourselves.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 nodded.	 “According	 to	 your	 call	 records,	 you	 waited	 a	 good</p>
<p class="calibre1">twenty-five	 minutes	 before	 placing	 the	 call	 to	 the	 nearest	 military	 hospital, regarding	Lieutenant	Commander	Dean's	condition.	Why	did	you	wait	so	long?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 kept	 the	 device	 in	 his	 hand	 held	 up.	 Simon	 suspected	 it	 was	 recording</p>
<p class="calibre1">everything	that	was	being	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	considered	that	he	may	have	been	taking	part	in	a	classified	mission	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">needed	to	be	sure	I	wouldn't	be	putting	the	operation	or	other	participants	at	risk</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	drawing	attention	to	his	presence.”	Simon	stopped	short	of	telling	him	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dean's	objection	to	the	call	for	an	ambulance	or	other	medical	assistance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	rep,	however,	seemed	satisfied.	“Okay,	that's	fine.	I	can	appreciate	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	was	a	difficult	position	you	found	yourself	in,	but	you	made	the	right	decision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 believe	 you're	 currently	 in	 the	 service	 of	 the	 Confederation	 Stellar	 Navy</p>
<p class="calibre1">yourself?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Could	you	please	state	your	full	name	and	rank?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Second	Lieutenant	Simon	Dodds,”	Simon	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	tapped	away	at	the	digital	assistant	in	his	hand	and	waited	for	it	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">retrieve	 the	 information	 he	 was	 after.	 “Hmmmm.	 Says	 here	 that	 you've	 been	 a pilot	 for	 several	 years	 and	 that	 you	 are	 currently	 on	 suspension	 from	 active service;	 reinstatement	 not	 due	 for	 at	 least	 another	 six	 to	 seven	 weeks,	 pending the	 outcome	 of	 further	 hearings.”	 He	 tapped	 at	 the	 device	 and	 then	 whistled. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>“Court-martialed	 back	 at	 the	 beginning	 of	 December	 on	 two	 counts	 of involuntary	manslaughter,	as	well	as	disobeying	orders	during...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	yeah,	we	get	the	picture,”	Simon	interrupted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	that's	all	correct?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	Simon	said,	trying	not	to	glare. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“May	I	ask	where	you've	been	and	what	you've	been	doing	for	the	last	four</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	a	half	months?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I've	been	working	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doing	what,	exactly?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon	 looked	 around,	 then	 back	 at	 the	 man	 in	 disdain.	 “What	 the	 hell	 do</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	think?	I've	been	picking	apples!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Cool	it,	Lieutenant.”	More	tapping.	“You've	not	been	anywhere	else?	Not</p>
<p class="calibre1">left	the	country	or	the	planet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,”	the	representative	said.	“Did	Dean	speak	much	before	his	death?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only	 to	 tell	 me	 that	 he	 had	 ejected	 from	 his	 Tactical	 Assault	 Fighter, </p>
<p class="calibre1">though	I	never	heard	it	come	down.	It's	pretty	quiet	around	here,	so	I'm	sure	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 have	 woken	 me	 up.	 He	 didn't	 manage	 to	 tell	 me	 how	 he	 got	 all	 those bullet	wounds	either.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 TAF	 has	 been	 taken	 care	 of,”	 the	 man	 stated,	 eyes	 focused	 on	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">digital	assistant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	did	it	come	down?”	Simon	asked,	looking	around	a	little	confused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 half	 expected	 to	 see	 a	 plume	 of	 smoke	 rising	 from	 somewhere	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">distance.	 “Not	 in	 one	 of	 the	 orchards?”	 If	 the	 TAF	 had	 come	 down,	 then</p>
<p class="calibre1">wouldn't	 there	 be	 some	 sign	 of	 its	 crash?	 And	 come	 to	 think	 of	 it,	 where	  <i class="calibre4">was</i> Dean's	parachute? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	don't	worry.	There's	no	need	to	be	concerned	about	that.	Like	I	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">it's	been	taken	care	of.”	The	man	raised	his	eyes	from	his	PDA.	“You're	sure	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn't	say	anything	else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon	felt	as	though	the	man	was	trying	to	suggest	that	he	might	be	trying</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	hide	something.	“No.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.	 Thank	 you	 for	 your	 co-operation,	 Lieutenant.	 You	 can	 let	 your</p>
<p class="calibre1">family	 know	 that	 we	 will	 be	 departing	 shortly,”	 the	 man	 said	 before	 powering down	 the	 PDA	 and	 slipping	 it	 back	 into	 his	 jacket.	 He	 pressed	 a	 button	 on	 a device	in	his	ear	and	spoke	to	confirm	he	was	finished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon	 started	 off	 to	 re-join	 his	 mother	 and	 father,	 who	 were	 hovering	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	porch	and	trying	to	see	inside	the	house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse	 me,	 Lieutenant,”	 the	 NIS	 representative	 called	 out	 to	 him,	 before</p>
<p class="calibre1">jogging	over	to	join	the	three.	“Just	one	thing	before	we	go...” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>The	three	listened	as	he	made	one	last	point	clear:	no-one	had	come	to	the house	 that	 night	 and	 none	 of	 them	 had	 ever	 heard	 of	 a	 man	 by	 the	 name	 of Patrick	Dean.	Once	they	understood	and	agreed	with	what	he	was	telling	them, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	then	informed	them,	in	rather	pleasant	tones,	that	they	would	have	their	couch</p>

<p class="calibre1">afternoon,	 following	 the	 Navy's	 departure.	 Simon	 did	 not	 comment,	 the	 whole</p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">A</b>lthough	 the	 CSN's	 reappearance	 at	 the	 Dodds	 household	 was	 by	 no	 means discreet,	the	first	Simon	knew	about	it	was	due	to	the	sound	of	his	father	cursing</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 the	 top	 of	 his	 voice	 and	 striding	 with	 great	 displeasure	 towards	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Confederation	transport	craft	that	had	landed	close	to	the	house.	It	had	touched</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	in	one	of	the	orchards	belonging	to	the	family,	damaging	the	valuable	crop</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	sending	his	father	into	a	rage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon	 had	 been	 sitting	 in	 the	 study	 at	 the	 time,	 pushing	 a	 pen	 around</p>
<p class="calibre1">various	 pieces	 of	 paper.	 At	 the	 sound	 of	 his	 father's	 cursing	 he	 left	 the	 house, seeing	 the	 CSN	 representative	 that	 was	 making	 his	 way	 up	 the	 track;	 the	 man removing	 a	 white	 envelope	 from	 within	 his	 jacket.	 Simon's	 father	 strode	 past him,	caring	little	for	what	he	had	to	say	and	only	about	what	was	happening	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	field. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Second	 Lieutenant	 Simon	 Dodds?”	 the	 man	 in	 full	 naval	 dress	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sporting	a	pair	of	dark	glasses	asked,	as	Simon	hurried	after	his	father. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah?”	Simon	answered,	both	men	now	following	Gregory	down	the	track</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	direction	of	the	transport. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	request	came	in	from	CSN	HQ	for	you	today.	I	should	advise	you	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 is	 urgent.”	 Simon	 took	 the	 envelope	 from	 the	 man	 and	 removed	 the	 single piece	of	folded	paper	within.	Though	the	letter	was	brief,	the	message	was	clear:</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	called	for	his	immediate	return	to	duty.	His	suspension	was	over,	even	though</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	had	only	served	five	months	of	the	six	he	had	been	handed.	Odd.	Suspensions</p>
<p class="calibre1">often	 ran	 far	 longer,	 whilst	 the	 Confederation	 Stellar	 Navy	 considered</p>
<p class="calibre1">reinstatement	of	personnel.	Stranger	still	was	that	the	request	had	been	made	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 form	 of	 a	 personal	 letter.	 A	 video	 call	 was	 far	 more	 usual.	 The	 Navy's presence	at	the	family	home,	to	hand	deliver	said	letter,	further	compounded	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">supposed	urgent	nature	of	the	request. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	I	have	to	leave	right	now?”	Simon	asked,	lowering	the	letter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	 the	 man	 shook	 his	 head.	 “But	 I'd	 suggest	 you	 be	 prepared	 to	 do	 so</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>early	tomorrow	morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Was	 the	 request	 made	 on	 behalf	 of	 anyone	 in	 particular?”	 Simon	 said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">turning	the	piece	of	paper	over	a	few	times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	believe	it	was	Commodore	Parks,”	the	delegate	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon	looked	again	 at	the	letter,	 trying	to	extract	 some	more	information; </p>
<p class="calibre1">trying	to	read	what	was	not	there.	As	he	did	so,	he	vaguely	heard	the	messenger</p>
<p class="calibre1">telling	 his	 father	 that	 the	 family	 business	 would	 be	 compensated	 for	 any</p>
<p class="calibre1">untoward	damage	to	his	field. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	CSN	inspector	and	maybe	even	a	government	inspector,	if	need	be,	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	dispatched	to	assess	the	possible	damage.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	that's	not	good	enough,”	his	father	bellowed	back	at	the	dark	glasses</p>
<p class="calibre1">wearing	man,	who	raised	both	hands	in	a	defensive	gesture.	“That's	an	 <i class="calibre4">organic</i></p>

<p class="calibre1">“As	I	said	sir,	I	am	sorry	for	any	damage	that	we	may	have	caused...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	yet	you	are	still	not	shutting	off	those	damn	engines!”	Gregory	said	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">disbelief,	throwing	his	hands	up	in	the	air.	The	shuttle's	engines	were	burning	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">grass	behind	it	and	Simon	could	only	guess	at	the	long-term	effects	it	might	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	crop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	Dodds	family	owned	several	orchards	and	were	proud	to	be	one	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">few	 remaining	 large	 scale	 organic	 farms	 remaining	 in	 Ireland.	 Much	 of	 the</p>

<p class="calibre1">He	spent	much	of	the	afternoon	stuffing	clothes	into	a	bag	in	preparation	for	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">departure	 early	 the	 next	 morning.	 His	 father's	 voice	 had	 drifted	 up	 the	 stairs	 to his	room	as	he	did	so;	the	man	expectant	of	not	only	a	very	large	cheque	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	CSN,	but	an	even	bigger	apology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gregory	was	still	seething	over	the	CSN's	visit	to	his	orchard	when	Simon</p>
<p class="calibre1">joined	 his	 parents	 at	 the	 table	 for	 dinner.	 The	 true	 extent	 of	 the	 damage	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>become	clear	once	they	had	departed	and	it	wasn't	good.	He	shot	Simon	a	dark look	as	he	settled	into	his	chair,	the	young	man	quite	aware	that	his	father	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">holding	him	partly	responsible	for	the	events	of	the	past	couple	of	weeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 know	 they	 only	 want	 you	 to	 come	 back	 and	 sign	 something	 so	 they</p>

<p class="calibre1">“I	doubt	that,”	Simon	said,	taking	a	sip	of	orange	juice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 father	 tutted.	 “Well,	 even	 if	 they	 don't	 you	 should	 give	 it	 up	 anyway; get	yourself	a	proper	job.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 don't	 have	 to	 go,	 you	 know.	 You	 could	 just	 stay	 here,”	 his	 mother</p>
<p class="calibre1">commented	as	she	deposited	three	plates	of	chicken,	rice	and	salad	on	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	mother's	right,”	his	father	muttered	again,	not	giving	Simon	a	chance</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 speak.	 “You	 should	 have	 just	 worked	 here	 instead	 of	 joining	 the	 Navy.	 You wouldn't	have	to	worry	about	promotions,	gruelling	exercises,	crap	food	or	even</p>
<p class="calibre1">chances	of	getting	killed.	You	could	be	giving	out	the	orders	instead	of	receiving</p>
<p class="calibre1">them.	 Other	 people	 would	 be	 doing	 the	 work.	 I've	 been	 there,	 Simon.	 It's	 not worth	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon	 paused	 in	 the	 process	 of	 cutting	 into	 his	 chicken	 and	 set	 his	 knife</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	fork	back	down	on	the	table.	This	again.	“Dad,	you	were	never	in	the	Navy,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	said,	rolling	his	eyes.	It	was	the	same	thing	his	father	had	said	to	him	the	day</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	had	told	them	of	his	plan	to	become	a	pilot	in	the	CSN.	He	sometimes	wished</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	had	a	brother	or	sister,	if	only	to	have	someone	on	which	to	deflect	unwanted</p>
<p class="calibre1">attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	father	waved	his	glass	of	red	wine	dismissively,	but	said	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 the	 request	 is	 urgent,”	 Simon	 reminded	 him,	 not	 touching	 his	 food</p>
<p class="calibre1">until	he	could	gain	some	sort	of	support	for	his	decision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You'll	 be	 back	 here	 in	 a	 few	 days,”	 his	 father	 said,	 sipping	 the	 wine	 and reaching	for	a	small	granary	roll. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In	truth,	his	father	was	not	being	negative	about	Simon's	ability,	or	intentions	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">continue	his	career	within	the	Navy;	he	had	just	become	used	to	having	Simon</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	 for	 the	 last	 few	 months.	 Simon	 had	 been	 in	 the	 Navy	 for	 close	 to	 ten years	and	his	mother	and	father	had	missed	seeing	him	grow	into	an	adult. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>family	close	by.	But	a	bigger	part	of	him	was	set	in	the	decision	to	return.	Even his	 father's	 attempt	 at	 emotional	 blackmail	 could	 not	 dissuade	 him	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1">responding	 to	 the	 CSN's	 request.	 Though	 he	 could	 just	 as	 well	 have	 refused	 it and	then	terminated	his	service,	he	did	not.	He	owed	it	to	himself	to	put	things</p>

<p class="calibre1">Simon	 made	 his	 goodbyes	 and	 left	 first	 thing	 the	 next	 morning,	 the	 transport waiting	for	him	further	down	the	road	this	time.	He	had	been	summoned	not	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	planet	in	Sol,	but	to	another	star	system	within	the	Confederacy	known</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	Indigo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	interior	of	the	transport	was	like	that	of	a	small	private	jet,	if	not	quite</p>

<p class="calibre1">route,	overlaid	across	the	galactic	map	he	had	seen	so	many	time	before.	A	great</p>
<p class="calibre1">number	of	inhabited	and	uninhabited	star	systems	were	dotted	all	over	the	chart:</p>

<p class="calibre1">quite	 closely	 together;	 though	 there	 were	 a	 few	 stragglers	 here	 and	 there;	 the Mitikas	 Empire,	 on	 the	 left,	 comprised	 of	 a	 far	 greater	 number	 of	 systems,	 all snuggled	 together	 like	 fish	 that	 had	 been	 dragged	 up	 in	 a	 net;	 and	 then	 there were	the	Independent	Worlds,	running	between	the	two	huge	nations	like	a	gulf</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 a	 river,	 keeping	 them	 apart	 and	 acting	 like	 a	 buffer	 of	 sorts.	 Here	 and	 there throughout	 the	 declared	 independent	 space,	 star	 systems	 were	 marked	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">belonging	 to	 the	 Empire	 from	 where	 it	 had	 spidered	 out	 and	 captured	 some</p>
<p class="calibre1">during	the	latter	days	of	its	expansion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyes	lingered	on	a	few	of	the	systems	that	were	labelled	in	a	larger	type</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	 others:	 Sol	 and	 Alpha	 Centauri	 within	 the	 Confederacy;	 Alba,	 one	 of	 the more	 powerful	 and	 prosperous	 of	 the	 Independents;	 Krasst	 and	 Kethlan	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Empire,	 their	 lettering	 and	 stars	 rendered	 in	 red	 hues.	 For	 some	 reason,	 the colour	looked	a	little	ominous	compared	with	the	whites	and	blues.	He	turned	his</p>

<p class="calibre1">With	 the	 knowledge	 that	 the	 system	 he	 was	 travelling	 to	 was	 several</p>

<p class="calibre1">Despite	 knowing	 the	 planet	 to	 be	 home	 to	 many	 planetary	 explorers	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">independent	 research	 groups,	 the	 Confederation	 had	 allowed	 them	 to	 do	 so, </p>
<p class="calibre1">intending	to	strike	and	bring	to	an	end	their	repeated	acts	of	aggression	once	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 all	 together.	 When	 the	 time	 had	 come,	 the	 Confederation's	 armed	 forces</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 launched	 a	 large	 scale	 operation	 with	 the	 intention	 of	 simultaneously</p>
<p class="calibre1">evacuating	the	explorers	and	eliminating	the	enemy.	As	night	had	fallen,	landers</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	touched	down	and	ground	troops	and	vehicles	had	streamed	out.	Large	drop</p>
<p class="calibre1">ships	 broke	 the	 atmosphere	 and	 deployed	 fighter	 craft,	 Simon	 and	 the	  <i class="calibre4">White</i> <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	amongst	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though	 it	 had	 started	 well,	 the	 operation	 ran	 into	 difficulty	 when</p>
<p class="calibre1">reinforcement	enemy	fighters	had	arrived	in	the	conflict	zone	without	warning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following	their	appearance,	Hawke	had	ordered	the	air	support	to	pull	back.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	concerned	that	the	additional	aerial	combat	would	have	a	detrimental	effect</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 success	 of	 the	 mission,	 endangering	 the	 ground	 teams	 as	 the	 risk	 of friendly	fire	to	and	from	the	surface	increased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	squadrons	pulled	back,	Simon	had	witnessed	two	of	his	wingmates</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	brought	down	and,	frustrated	with	the	way	things	were	going,	had	looped</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>back	around	to	try	and	prevent	further	losses.	His	efforts	had	resulted	in	his	own fighter	sustaining	heavy	damage	and	dropping	from	the	sky.	He	had	ditched	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">far	from	a	rescue	point.	In	the	confusion	-	and	with	the	desire	to	get	back	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 advancing	 enemy	 lines	 as	 quickly	 as	 possible	 -	 Simon	 had	 retrieved	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">weapon	from	a	downed	soldier	and	headed	back	towards	the	extraction	zone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Along	the	way,	he	had	been	surprised	by	a	group	of	men	and	women	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	run	into	him.	His	own	survival	instinct	had	kicked	in,	causing	him	to	open</p>
<p class="calibre1">fire.	 It	 was	 only	 after	 blood	 had	 splattered	 the	 ground,	 soaking	 into	 the	 dark sand,	colouring	small	rocks	and	pebbles,	and	covering	the	bodies	of	his	victims</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	hands	of	those	that	were	trying	to	help	them	that	he	realised	who	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">shooting	at. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 the	 unlawful	 killings	 of	 Poppy	 Castro	 and	 Stefan	 Pitt,	 the	 blatant</p>
<p class="calibre1">disregard	 for	 orders,	 and	 the	 loss	 of	 a	 Tactical	 Assault	 Fighter	 he	 could	 have flown	home,	the	court-martial	had	suspended	him	from	duty	for	six	months.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	returned	to	Earth,	tail	between	his	legs,	to	stay	out	the	time	with	his	parents</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	get	away	from	everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	whole	experience	was	one	that	he	never	wished	to	go	through	again. </p>

<p class="calibre1">After	several	hours,	his	transport	arrived	in	the	Indigo	system	and	not	long	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	 docked	 at	 Xalan	 Orbital	 Station	 where	 he	 was	 to	 meet	 with	 the	 senior command. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Time	 to	 be	 known	 as	 Dodds	 again</i>,	 Simon	 thought	 as	 he	 picked	 up	 his belongings.	An	attendant	met	him	as	he	exited	the	transport	and	led	him	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">landing	 deck	 to	 a	 lift	 and,	 from	 there,	 down	 the	 various	 corridors	 to	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">appointment.	 The	 escort	 rushed	 him	 along,	 giving	 Dodds	 no	 time,	 or	 place,	 to stow	his	bag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Second	 Lieutenant	 Simon	 Dodds	 to	 see	 the	 Admiral,”	 Dodds'	 escort</p>
<p class="calibre1">informed	 one	 of	 the	 two	 female	 security	 guards	 standing	 outside	 the	 meeting</p>
<p class="calibre1">room.	She	communicated	the	message	to	another	standing	within.	The	door	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">opened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fleet	Admiral	Turner	is	waiting	for	you	inside,”	the	woman	said,	gesturing</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	him	to	go	forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Admiral	Turner?”	Dodds	repeated,	feeling	his	mouth	go	dry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.	Fleet	Admiral	Turner.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">They	didn't	bother	to	put	</i> that <i class="calibre4">	into	the	letter</i>,	Dodds	thought,	before	realising</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>his	jaw	had	become	slack	and	that	his	mouth	was	hanging	open.	He	shut	it	and cleared	his	throat.	“Thank	you,”	he	said	and	entered	the	meeting	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Walking	up	to	the	front,	he	set	his	bag	down,	removed	his	cap,	and	saluted	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">three	men	seated	behind	a	long,	well	polished	wooden	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Second	 Lieutenant	 Simon	 Dodds	 reporting	 as	 requested,	 sir,”	 Dodds</p>
<p class="calibre1">presented	 himself.	 He	 stood	 before	 the	 three	 men	 in	 full	 naval	 dress:	 a	 pair	 of dark	blue	trousers	and	blazer	with	gold	trims	and	buttons.	On	his	feet	he	wore	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">pair	of	well-polished	black	shoes,	which	he	had	become	quite	conscious	of	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">last	couple	of	minutes,	for	some	reason.	Perhaps	it	was	because	of	the	clamorous</p>
<p class="calibre1">clopping	 they	 made	 as	 he	 walked,	 announcing	 his	 arrival	 much	 more	 than	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	have	liked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 no	 answer	 from	 any	 of	 the	 men	 behind	 the	 table.	 The	 admiral, </p>
<p class="calibre1">seated	in	the	middle,	continued	his	unhurried	leaf	through	a	number	of	pieces	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">paper	in	front	of	him,	apparently	deciding	to	make	him	wait	on	purpose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 recognised	 all	 three	 of	 the	 men	 in	 front	 of	 him:	 Commodore	 Parks</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	Commodore	Hawke	sat	either	side	of	Turner,	both	waiting	patiently	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">admiral	to	begin.	Behind	the	desk,	a	window	that	made	up	the	entire	back	wall</p>
<p class="calibre1">permitted	Dodds	a	view	of	the	twinkling	stars	outside.	He	forced	himself	not	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	distracted	by	the	sight.	Aside	from	the	four	men,	only	two	others	occupied	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">room:	both	armed	security	personnel	by	the	closed	door	at	the	other	end,	rifles</p>
<p class="calibre1">drawn	and	pointed	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	waited	some	more.	Turner	continued	to	turn	pages.	Dodds	started	to	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	impression	that	what	was	about	to	be	discussed	was	quite	confidential.	After</p>
<p class="calibre1">sometime,	Turner	looked	up	from	his	reading,	gathering	together	the	papers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Before	we	begin,	Lieutenant	Dodds,	I	have	a	question	I	want	to	ask	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	admiral	clasped	his	hands	together	on	the	desk	before	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,”	Dodds	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	me:	what	does	the	name	“Lieutenant	Commander	Patrick	Dean”	mean</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He's	a	TAF	pilot,	sir.	Flies	with	the	 <i class="calibre4">Yellow	Dogs</i>.	He	was	recently	injured</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	line	of	duty,”	Dodds	said	truthfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wrong	answer,	Dodds,”	Turner	said	with	false	patience.	“I'll	ask	you	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">again.	Who	is	Lieutenant	Commander	Patrick	Dean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	noticed	that	all	three	of	the	men	were	staring	fixated	at	him	and	he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>became	thankful	for	the	cap	that	he	held	by	his	side,	his	grip	tightening	on	it.	He grasped	 the	 direction	 that	 the	 admiral's	 question	 was	 leading	 him	 and, </p>
<p class="calibre1">remembering	what	he	had	been	told	on	the	morning	of	Dean's	death,	supplied	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">next	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	know,	sir.	I've	never	heard	of	him.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent.	Neither	have	I,”	Turner	said,	sitting	back	up	straight.	The	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared	 satisfied	 with	 the	 point	 he	 was	 making,	 it	 now	 very	 clear	 in	 Dodds' </p>
<p class="calibre1">mind.	 “Shall	 we	 get	 this	 underway	 then?”	 the	 admiral	 asked	 of	 the	 two	 other officers	before	turning	back	to	Dodds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	 are	 three	 reasons	 why	 you	 have	 been	 brought	 out	 here	 today, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lieutenant,”	 began	 Turner.	 “None	 of	 which	 should	 be	 allowed	 to	 go	 to	 your</p>
<p class="calibre1">head.	First	and	foremost:	it	is	after	considerable	discussion	that	we	have	decided</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 your	 suspension	 from	 duty	 has	 been	 met.	 You	 should	 have	 had	 sufficient time	during	this	period	to	reflect	upon	your	actions	and	realise	just	how	serious</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	costly	your	mistakes	were.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,”	Dodds	said,	straightening.	“During	my	suspension	I	spent	a	lot	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">time...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Secondly,”	 Turner	 continued,	 raising	 his	 voice	 whilst	 at	 the	 same	 time</p>
<p class="calibre1">telling	Dodds	to	silence	his	own,	“naval	human	resources	are	at	an	all	time	low</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	we	need	every	man	and	woman	we	can	get	a	hold	of.	You	may	be	aware	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 on-going	 problems	 we	 are	 facing	 securing	 Confederation	 interests	 against</p>
<p class="calibre1">increasing	 insurgency,	 as	 well	 as	 the	 not-so-insubstantial	 threat	 posed	 by	 the Imperial	 civil	 war.	 The	 war	 is	 now	 causing	 unrest	 in	 a	 number	 of	 Independent World	star	systems;	unrest	and	disturbance	that	could	eventually	spill	over	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">Confederation-controlled	 space.	 Should	 that	 happen,	 we	 can	 be	 assured	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">immigrants	will	come	pouring	into	many	of	our	own	systems,	bringing	refugees, </p>
<p class="calibre1">criminals,	bounty	hunters	and	even	more	insurgents	along	with	them.	In	order	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">pre-empt	such	an	event	we	need	to	increase	naval	presence	along	our	borders.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	saw	the	map	he	had	studied	for	the	last	few	hours	once	more	in	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">head,	focusing	in	on	the	former	Independent	worlds	that	had	been	swallowed	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	the	Empire.	He	could	not	quite	imagine	the	same	thing	happening	in	reverse</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 Confederacy,	 as	 Turner	 might	 well	 be	 suggesting.	 He	 might	 not	 know	 a great	deal	about	the	history	of	the	galaxy,	but	he	assumed	that	the	Confederation</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	a	little	more	stable	than	most	other	places;	considerably	more	so	than	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	Independents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 image	 evaporated	 as	 Turner	 continued	 speaking.	 “This	 is	 a	 point	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">needs	 to	 be	 understood	 by	 all	 Naval	 personnel:	 the	 relationship	 between	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Imperial	Senate	and	the	Emperor	is	now	strained	beyond	repair	and	as	such	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Confederacy,	as	well	as	a	number	of	Independent	nations,	have	begun	the	recall</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>of	 all	 diplomatic	 staff.	 You	 may	 hear	 talk	 of	 parts	 of	 the	 Empire	 having	 been <i class="calibre4">bombed	 back	 into	 the	 stone	 age</i>,	 but	 for	 now	 the	 Confederation	 will	  <i class="calibre4">not</i>	 be sending	forces	into	any	part	of	the	region	in	an	attempt	to	bring	about	stability.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	had	heard	about	the	issues	that	were	plaguing	the	Empire,	the	events</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	 a	 regular	 feature	 on	 news	 broadcasts.	 The	 trouble	 was	 that,	 since	 it	 had become	 such	 a	 regular	 feature	 of	 the	 news,	 he	 had	 almost	 stopped	 paying</p>
<p class="calibre1">attention	to	it	altogether.	It	was	like	background	noise	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 eyes	 swept	 over	 Parks	 and	 Hawke	 sitting	 either	 side	 of	 Turner.	 Each</p>
<p class="calibre1">both	 looked	 straight	 at	 him,	 as	 Turner	 did,	 their	 faces	 inexpressive.	 They	 were both	 in	 their	 forties	 and	 of	 similar	 height,	 although	 Parks	 looked	 thinner	 than Hawke,	 both	 in	 the	 body	 and	 face.	 Strands	 of	 silvery	 grey	 hair	 were	 quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">prominent	 throughout	 Parks'	 thinning	 black	 hair,	 but	 absent	 from	 Hawke's. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turner	by	contrast	was	quite	an	old	man.	Dodds	thought	he	was	somewhere	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	early	sixties,	close	to	retirement	age. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 had	 noticed	 when	 he	 entered	 the	 room	 that	 Parks	 seemed	 to	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">aged	a	good	ten	years	since	he	had	last	seen	the	man,	looking	older	than	Hawke, </p>
<p class="calibre1">despite	 being	 six	 or	 seven	 years	 younger.	 Strangely,	 Hawke	 appeared	 much</p>
<p class="calibre1">healthier	by	comparison.	Fresh-faced,	the	man	was	almost	glowing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	finally	Lieutenant	it	is	my	privilege	to	inform	you	-” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	detected	a	hint	of	sarcasm	in	the	admiral's	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“-	 that	 you	 have	 been	 recommended	 and	 subsequently	 selected	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">participation	in	the	Navy's	latest	technological	endeavour.	It	is	not	a	decision	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	entirely	agree	with	-” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 turned	 his	 head	 only	 a	 minute	 amount	 to	 acknowledge	 the	 accusing</p>
<p class="calibre1">look	he	was	given	by	Admiral	Turner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“-	but	your	flight	profile,	along	with	your	 <i class="calibre4">usual</i>	ability	to	work	well	within</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	team,	made	you	fit	the	bill.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	sir,”	Dodds	said.	“It	will	be	an	honour	to	take	part.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turner	 gave	 an	 unconvinced	 snort,	 then	 said,	 “Tell	 me,	 Lieutenant,	 has</p>
<p class="calibre1">anyone	discussed	with	you	anything	about	the	ATAF	project?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	sir.	No-one	has	ever	mentioned	it	to	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	 it	 should	 be,”	 Turner	 said.	 “The	 project	 is	 strictly	 on	 a	 need-to-know</p>
<p class="calibre1">basis	and,	as	of	this	moment,	you	are	not	to	discuss	it	with	anyone	not	directly</p>
<p class="calibre1">involved	 in	 the	 evaluations.	 I	 must	 warn	 you	 that	 to	 do	 so	 would	 result	 in	 a punishment	far	worse	than	a	mere	suspension	from	service.	Am	I	making	myself</p>
<p class="calibre1">clear?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.	 I	 believe	 that	 is	 all	 I	 wish	 to	 say,”	 Turner	 concluded,	 sliding	 the papers	in	front	of	him	back	into	their	folder.	“I	did	not	intend	for	this	to	be	a	long</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>meeting,	so	I	will	wrap	things	up	here.	Unless	there	is	anything	further	that	you wish	 to	 add,	 Commodore?”	 He	 looked	 to	 Parks	 who	 shook	 his	 head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Commodore?”	His	attention	turned	to	Hawke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 must	 once	 again	 reiterate	 my	 objection	 to	 this	 man's	 reinstatement	 into</p>
<p class="calibre1">active	 service,	 Admiral!”	 Hawke	 spat.	 “The	 man	 is	 a	 cocky,	 arrogant</p>
<p class="calibre1">insubordinate	 who	 is	 a	 danger	 to	 himself,	 his	 squadron	 and	 the	 Navy's	 very</p>
<p class="calibre1">reputation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 gave	 an	 inward	 sigh.	 It	 felt	 as	 though	 the	 commodore	 had	 spent</p>
<p class="calibre1">several	hours	before	the	meeting	rehearsing	the	line,	so	as	to	deliver	it	without</p>
<p class="calibre1">error	for	maximum	effect.	The	moment	Dodds	had	entered	the	meeting	room	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">seen	 Hawke	 seated	 alongside	 Turner	 and	 Parks,	 he	 knew	 there	 would	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">problems. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	do	not	doubt	for	even	one	second	that	he	will	continue	to	mock	the	chain</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	command	within	weeks	of	being	back	in	control	of	a	starfighter,”	Hawke	went</p>
<p class="calibre1">on,	glaring	at	Dodds.	“It	would	be	better	for	all	of	us	if	the	man	were	reassigned</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	logistics	where	he...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 that	 will	 do,	 Commodore,	 I	 am	 fully	 aware	 of	 your	 objections,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">interrupted	 the	 admiral,	 waving	 him	 down.	 “Thank	 you	 for	 repeating	 your</p>
<p class="calibre1">original	statement,	but	I	read	it	clearly	the	first	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawke	turned	back	to	look	at	Dodds,	a	dark	scowl	across	his	face.	“No,	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	nothing	further	to	add,	Admiral,”	he	finished	dryly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 felt	 a	 small	 sense	 of	 relief	 swell	 within	 him.	 How	 Hawke	 loved	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">gloat.	 Should	 Turner	 have	 agreed	 with	 the	 man's	 suggestion,	 Hawke's	 eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 have	 been	 filled	 with	 that	 subtle,	 malicious	 satisfaction;	 the	 very	 same pleasure	 that	 Dodds	 had	 seen	 register	 during	 his	 court-martial,	 the	 moment	 the guilty	 verdict	 had	 been	 brought	 against	 him.	 But	 not	 now.	 He	 had	 been	 denied such	delight	today	and	would	have	to	find	it	another	time,	in	another	place.	And</p>
<p class="calibre1">preferably	with	someone	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds'	eyes	were	drawn	to	a	crimson-red	substance	that	was	gathering	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">above	 the	 commodore's	 top	 lip	 and	 noticed	 that	 Hawke's	 nose	 had	 started	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">bleed.	Hawke,	too,	became	aware	of	the	flow	and	rummaged	around	in	a	pocket</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	a	handkerchief,	producing	it	just	as	a	drop	of	blood	slid	down	from	his	nose</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	splattered	without	a	sound	onto	the	table	in	front	of	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 watched	 the	 man	 place	 the	 handkerchief	 under	 his	 nose	 and	 tip	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">head	back,	attempting	to	control	the	flow,	though	Hawke	kept	his	eyes	on	him	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	did	so.	It	was	not	as	though	his	nose	was	gushing,	but	it	was	obvious	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	 than	 a	 few	 drops.	 Dodds	 found	 it	 strange	 that,	 though	 Parks	 and	 Turner looked	over	to	the	man	to	see	what	the	cause	of	his	sudden	discomfort	was,	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">gave	 it	 no	 more	 than	 a	 common	 courtesy	 before	 they	 turned	 back	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>starfighter	pilot	stood	before	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.	 We	 must	 press	 on	 gentlemen,	 time	 is	 not	 a	 commodity	 we	 can</p>
<p class="calibre1">currently	 afford	 to	 waste,”	 Turner	 said.	 “Lieutenant	 Dodds,	 I	 am	 hereby</p>
<p class="calibre1">returning	you	to	duty.	Commodore	Parks	will	brief	you	shortly.”	He	gestured	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	of	the	guards	standing	by	the	door	who	strode	forward	to	Dodds'	side.	“Mr</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sears	here	will	escort	you	to	a	suitable	waiting	room	where	the	commodore	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">meet	you.	You	are	dismissed,	Lieutenant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	sir,”	Dodds	said,	saluting	before	replacing	his	cap,	picking	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	bag	of	meagre	belongings	and	making	to	leave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lieutenant	 Dodds,”	 the	 admiral's	 voice	 called	 to	 him	 as	 he	 crossed	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir?”	 Dodds	 stopped	 halfway	 to	 the	 door	 and	 turned	 around	 to	 face	 the</p>

<p class="calibre1">“With	 regard	 to	 the	 statement	 that	 Commodore	 Hawke	 gave:	 whilst	 the</p>

<p class="calibre1">know.	Do	you	understand	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 sir.	 Fully,	 sir,”	 Dodds	 said,	 saluted	 once	 more	 and	 left	 the	 meeting</p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">D</b>odds	 jumped	 to	 his	 feet	 as	 he	 heard	 the	 door	 of	 his	 assigned	 waiting	 room open,	almost	spilling	the	glass	of	water	he	held.	He	stood	to	attention	and	saluted</p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	as	the	man	entered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	ease,	Lieutenant,”	Parks	said.	“Welcome	back,	Dodds;	and	welcome	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Indigo	system,	I	might	add.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	room	the	pair	stood	in	granted	its	occupants	an	appreciative	view	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">planet	below	them,	something	that	Dodds	had	spent	the	last	half-hour	staring	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">at.	He	often	made	a	habit	of	looking	out	at	the	stars,	sometimes	just	for	the	view, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	frequently	because	it	helped	him	to	think.	He	found	the	often	tranquil	views</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	be	rather	therapeutic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	trust	you	had	a	good	journey	here?”	Parks	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uneventful,”	Dodds	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	stayed	out	your	entire	suspension	on	Earth?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With	my	parents.	I	was	giving	them	a	hand	with	the	business.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	nodded	and	his	eyes	gave	the	young	man	a	once-over.	“Good	to	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	didn't	come	back	soft	and	completely	out	of	shape	after	all	that	time	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Too	many	do	so	after	a	few	weeks	of	leave.”	Parks	came	to	stand	with	Dodds	by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 window	 and	 nodded	 to	 the	 planet	 far	 below.	 “Xalan.	 Where	 you	 will	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">spending	 the	 next	 three	 weeks	 training	 for	 the	 ATAF	 project.	 Myself	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Admiral	 Turner	 will	 also	 be	 stationed	 there	 during	 that	 period	 to	 oversee	 your progress.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	else	will	be	there?”	Dodds	asked,	figuring	that	he	would	not	be	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sole	participant	in	the	training	program.	He	had	a	hunch	that	his	old	wingmates</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	on	the	surface. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aside	from	yourself	and	the	 <i class="calibre4">White	Knights</i>,	there	will	be	two	other	teams</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	five	who	you	will	be	undergoing	the	evaluations.	At	the	end	of	the	three-week</p>
<p class="calibre1">period,	the	team	who	has	successfully	completed	the	evaluation	and	passed	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">final	examination	will	be	the	one	that	will	go	on	to	pilot	the	ATAFs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>“Got	it,”	said	Dodds.	Sounded	easy	enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	paused,	then	said,	“This	isn't	an	individual	exercise,	Lieutenant.	Your</p>
<p class="calibre1">success	or	failure	during	these	tests	will	be	governed	by	your	ability	to	work	as	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">team	 <i class="calibre4">and	follow	orders</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	could	feel	Parks'	stare	boring	into	him	even	before	he	turned	around</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	meet	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don't	screw	this	up,	Dodds,”	Parks	said	in	a	stern	voice,	his	mood	now	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lot	more	serious	than	when	he	had	first	entered	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 won't,	 sir,”	 Dodds	 said	 earnestly.	 Though	 Dodds	 enjoyed	 a	 good</p>
<p class="calibre1">relationship	with	Parks	-	or	maybe	it	was	that	the	commodore	just	tolerated	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">better	 than	 most	 others	 -	 he	 was	 still	 only	 prepared	 to	 cut	 the	 young	 pilot	 so much	slack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 sure	 hope	 you	 mean	 that,	 Lieutenant,”	 Parks	 said,	 walking	 towards	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">door.	 “Now,	 whilst	 you're	 here	 you	 may	 as	 well	 attend	 a	 medical	 examination before	leaving	for	Xalan.	Your	team	mates	arrived	a	few	days	ago	so	they	will	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">able	to	show	you	around.	You	should	also	know	that	since	your	departure	we've</p>
<p class="calibre1">lost	 Wells	 to	 an	 accident	 during	 training,	 as	 well	 as	 your	 own	 replacement.	 de Winter	 will	 introduce	 you	 to	 your	 new	 team	 mate	 when	 you	 arrive	 at	 your</p>
<p class="calibre1">assigned	housing	block.”	The	door	slid	open	as	Parks	approached.	He	hovered	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 doorway,	 looking	 back	 at	 the	 second	 lieutenant	 who	 hadn't	 moved.	 “Come</p>
<p class="calibre1">on.	 Get	 your	 gear	 together,	 Dodds,	 we	 have	 a	 lot	 to	 get	 through	 before	 we leave.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 picked	 up	 his	 bag	 and	 followed	 the	 commodore	 out,	 his	 head</p>
<p class="calibre1">swimming	with	thoughts.	It	seemed	a	lot	had	happened	since	he	had	been	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	the	multiple	deaths	within	his	flight	group	had	hit	home.	Not	least	because</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 casual	 manner	 in	 which	 Parks	 had	 told	 him	 about	 it,	 as	 if	 there	 were greater	 concerns	 than	 keeping	 pilots	 alive.	 He	 wondered	 what	 other	 pieces	 of information	the	commodore	might	be	holding	back. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">suite.	 I	 thought	 Estelle	 was	 going	 to	 choke	 at	 the	 speed	 she	 wolfed	 hers	 down! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">She	 was	 acting	 like	 she	 hadn't	 eaten	 for	 weeks	 and	 like	 she	 didn't	 know	 where</i> <i class="calibre4">her	next	meal	was	coming	from!	She	did	the	same	thing	at	dinner,	too!	I'm	sure</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">that's	 not	 healthy.	 But	 there	 again	 something	 like	 this	 is	 a	 once	 in	 a	 life-time</i> <i class="calibre4">opportunity	and	she's	determined	to	do	whatever	it	takes	for	us	to	be	the	first	to</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">test	out	the	Navy's	latest	creation.	I	can't	say	exactly	what	it	is	here	or	suffer	the</i> <i class="calibre4">consequences. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">We	 are	 getting	 our	 first	 briefing	 this	 afternoon	 and	 then	 tomorrow	 we'll</i> <i class="calibre4">start	 our	 formal	 training.	 I	 don't	 know	 any	 of	 the	 pilots	 from	 the	 others	 teams,</i> <i class="calibre4">but	 Estelle	 seems	 to	 know	 a	 girl	 called	 Andrea.	 According	 to	 her	 we	 were	 at</i> <i class="calibre4">flight	 school	 together	 years	 ago,	 but	 I	 don't	 honestly	 remember.	 I	 haven't	 seen</i> <i class="calibre4">her	 about	 since	 our	 arrival,	 but	 apparently	 that's	 intentional	 since	 they	 don't</i> <i class="calibre4">want	the	teams	to	all	be	mixed	together. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">We're	in	a	mixed	dormitory	here,	no	separate	rooms,	so	looks	like	we	won't</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">be	 getting	 any	 ritzy	 treatment	 even	 though	 we're	 involved	 in	 a	 special	 project. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Luckily	 the	 room	 has	 been	 designed	 to	 accommodate	 quite	 a	 few	 people,	 and</i> <i class="calibre4">since	there	are	only	four	of	us	we	have	plenty	of	space;	so	at	least	that	won't	be	a</i> <i class="calibre4">cause	of	any	tension. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Enrique	 is	 just	 getting	 on	 with	 it,	 as	 he	 does.	 With	 everything	 that's	 going</i> <i class="calibre4">on,	 he's	 not	 really	 found	 the	 time	 and	 space	 to	 practice	 his	 martial	 arts	 or	 the</i> <i class="calibre4">other	 things	 he	 does.	 He	 was	 a	 bit	 put	 out	 that	 there	 might	 not	 be	 anyone	 to</i> <i class="calibre4">partner	 with	 whilst	 he	 was	 here.	 Being	 a	 research	 facility	 there	 are	 of	 course</i> <i class="calibre4">some	people	here,	but	I	think	Enrique	was	bothered	about	“hitting	nerds”	as	he</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">put	it. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Chaz,	the	new	boy	(he's	actually	a	bit	older	than	us,	only	known	him	a	few</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">weeks),	 said	 he'd	 spar	 with	 Enrique	 when	 they	 both	 got	 some	 free	 time,	 but</i> <i class="calibre4">Estelle	 soon	 put	 a	 stop	 to	 that.	 Think	 she's	 getting	 paranoid	 that	 one	 of	 them</i> <i class="calibre4">would	hurt	each	other	and	then	not	be	able	to	compete	efficiently. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I'm	 still	 not	 too	 sure	 about	 Chaz.	 When	 he	 first	 turned	 up	 he	 introduced</i> <i class="calibre4">himself	and	dispensed	all	the	normal	pleasantries,	but	wasn't	too	keen	on	giving</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">anything	else	away.	He	keeps	his	cards	very	close	to	his	chest.	As	far	as	I	can	tell</i> <i class="calibre4">it	was	Commodore	Parks'	idea	to	assign	him	to	our	team.	We,	of	course,	didn't</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p42"></a> <i class="calibre4">get	any	say	in	the	matter	and	Estelle	was	quite	concerned.

<p class="calibre1">As	Dodds	entered	the	room	he	saw	Kelly	Taylor	stop	writing	in	her	digital</p>
<p class="calibre1">journal,	and	look	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dodds!”	Kelly	said.	Dodds	had	changed	out	of	his	uniform	for	the	medical</p>
<p class="calibre1">examination.	He	now	wore	a	blue	naval	shirt	and	dark	slacks.	The	smart	uniform</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	his	mother	had	pressed	and	ironed	in	preparation	for	his	meeting	with	three</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 CSN's	 top	 brass	 now	 lay	 crumpled	 somewhere	 at	 the	 bottom	 of	 his	 bag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 had	 worn	 it	 twice	 in	 the	 space	 of	 six	 months,	 for	 the	 purpose	 of	 formal meetings,	and	was	not	keen	on	putting	back	on	again	any	time	soon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,	everyone,”	Dodds	said,	slinging	his	bag	onto	a	nearby	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	 Dodds!”	 A	 tall,	 sandy	 blonde-haired	 man	 over	 the	 other	 side	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">room	got	up	and	strode	over	to	greet	his	friend.	Dodds	noticed	when	he	entered</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 dormitory	 that	 Enrique	 had	 been	 propped	 up	 against	 the	 back	 wall,	 doing press	ups	on	his	head.	He	was	dressed	down	in	a	white	vest	and	thin	trousers	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 guessed	 that	 he	 was	 doing	 the	 exercises	 to	 let	 off	 some	 steam.	 Another man,	whom	Dodds	did	not	recognise,	lowered	the	book	he	was	reading	to	get	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">look	at	the	long	absent	team	member. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	Enrique,	how	you	doing?”	Dodds	said,	extending	a	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	said	we	should	expect	one	more	person	to	join	the	team,	but	I	didn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">expect	 to	 see	 your	 ugly	 face	 around	 here	 any	 time	 soon,”	 Enrique	 said	 with	 a chuckle,	greeting	his	friend	with	a	shake	of	hands,	an	embrace	and	a	hearty	slap</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	back.	“Made	it	back	okay	then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just,”	 Dodds	 smiled.	 “I	 think	 I	 would	 have	 been	 on	 the	 next	 shuttle	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Earth	if	Hawke	had	had	his	way.	Hadn't	been	back	hardly	five	minutes	before	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	on	my	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don't	let	him	wind	you	up,	mate,”	Enrique	said.	He,	too,	had	suffered	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">fair	share	of	encounters	with	the	commodore	in	the	past,	though	in	most	cases	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">account	of	Dodds,	one	way	or	another.	If	Hawke	possessed	a	list	of	personnel	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	CSN	that	he	most	disliked,	the	pair	could	be	certain	that	they	would	be	tied</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	the	top	spot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	how	you	doing,	Kelly?”	Dodds	asked	of	the	young	woman	who	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">untangling	 her	 legs	 and	 crawling	 off	 the	 bed	 she	 occupied.	 Kelly	 Taylor	 was	 a girl	of	average	height,	with	a	short	face,	long	brown	hair	and	brown	eyes.	Dodds</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>often	found	her	quite	cute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	 well,	 thanks,”	 Kelly	 said	 embracing	 him	 and	 giving	 him	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">affectionate	kiss	on	the	cheek.	“Nice	to	have	you	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	things	had	changed	a	lot	within	the	Navy	during	Dodds'	absence,	then	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">least	 he	 could	 take	 comfort	 in	 the	 fact	 that	 his	 friends	 had	 remained	 the	 same; although	 the	 team	 had	 shrunk	 from	 its	 initial	 ten	 members	 down	 to	 five,	 and there	was	now	a	new	addition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where's	Estelle?”	Dodds	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She'll	be	back	in	a	minute.	Think	she	went	to	check	the	simulation	stats	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">something,”	Kelly	said,	rolling	her	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 this	 is	 Chaz,	 the	 latest	 addition	 to	 the	  <i class="calibre4">White	 Knights</i>,”	 Enrique indicated	 the	 dark-skinned	 man	 who	 still	 lay	 on	 his	 bed	 at	 the	 far	 end	 of	 the room,	 reading.	 After	 briefly	 acknowledging	 the	 appearance	 of	 Dodds,	 he	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned	 his	 attention	 back	 to	 his	 book,	 looking	 quite	 uninterested	 in	 what	 was going	on.	Now,	he	put	the	book	down	and	jumped	from	the	top	bunk.	Dodds	saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	Chaz	was	not	only	very	tall,	but	built	with	it.	He	also	appeared	to	prefer	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">shave	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pleased	 to	 finally	 meet	 you,	 Dodds,”	 he	 said,	 joining	 the	 others.	 “My</p>
<p class="calibre1">name's	 Koonan;	 Chaz	 Koonan.	 Only	 been	 with	 the	 team	 for	 a	 few	 weeks,	 but</p>
<p class="calibre1">I've	heard	a	lot	about	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing	 good,	 I	 hope,”	 Dodds	 replied	 with	 a	 wry	 smile,	 shaking	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">massive	hand	that	Chaz	extended	towards	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Estelle	 assures	 me	 that	 you're	 a	 fine	 pilot,”	 Chaz	 said,	 dodging	 Dodds' </p>
<p class="calibre1">attempt	 to	 engage	 him	 in	 some	 comedic	 banter.	 There	 was	 something	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">man's	 voice	 that	 Dodds	 could	 not	 put	 his	 finger	 on.	 It	 was	 not	 unfriendly,	 but somehow	neutral	and	a	little	indifferent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	have	you	been	transferred	from?”	Dodds	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	a	long	story...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 and	 not	 one	 we	 currently	 have	 time	 for,”	 a	 voice	 came	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">doorway.	A	slender	woman	with	long,	jet	black	hair	that	fell	over	her	shoulders</p>
<p class="calibre1">stood	 at	 the	 entrance	 to	 the	 dormitory.	 Her	 attire	 was	 a	 close	 match	 to	 that	 of Enrique's,	 a	 small	 white	 vest	 and	 black	 trousers.	 In	 her	 hands,	 she	 clasped	 a number	of	sheets	of	paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,	Estelle.	How	are	you?”	Dodds	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	well,”	she	answered,	somewhat	pertly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh	 huh.	 Could	 I	 have	 a	 word	 with	 you	 out	 here?”	 she	 indicated	 out	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">door	and	then	left	the	dormitory.	Dodds	looked	at	the	others,	who	shrugged	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	dispersed	back	to	what	they	were	doing	before	he	arrived.	Frowning,	Dodds</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>followed	 Estelle	 out	 of	 the	 small	 housing	 block	 they	 had	 been	 assigned	 to, incensed	 at	 the	 way	 she	 had	 spoken	 to	 him	 within	 the	 first	 minute	 of	 being reunited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey...”	 Dodds	 called	 after	 her,	 stepping	 out	 into	 the	 warm	 morning	 sun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	 turned	 around	 to	 meet	 his	 confused	 expression,	 her	 own	 a	 picture	 of happiness.	She	walked	back	to	him	and	put	her	arms	around	the	man,	giving	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	tight	hug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I've	 missed	 you,”	 she	 said.	 “I	 didn't	 think	 you	 were	 ever	 going	 to	 come</p>
<p class="calibre1">back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	didn't	know	what	to	do,	though	a	few	moments	later	he	hugged	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“After	 you	 were	 suspended	 from	 duty,	 I	 figured	 you'd	 give	 it	 a	 couple	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">months	 and	 then	 hang	 up	 your	 boots.	 You've	 not	 been	 in	 touch	 at	 all.”	 Estelle broke	 their	 embrace,	 looking	 up	 into	 his	 face	 with	 a	 warm	 genuine	 smile,	 her dimples	showing	up	as	she	did	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	said	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	miss	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well...	sure	I	did.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	why	haven't	you	been	in	touch?”	She	swept	some	of	the	hair	that	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">fallen	over	her	face	out	of	the	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	needed	time	to	think.	I	just	wanted	to	get	a	clear	perspective	on	my	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	was	all	that	about?”	Dodds	asked	her,	referring	to	the	way	she	had	yanked</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	away	from	the	others	whilst	they	were	in	the	process	of	catching	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,”	Estelle	said.	“Right	now	I	want	everyone	to	stay	focused	on	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">we're	doing	here,	and	not	get	caught	up	in	emotional	reunions	that	could	have	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">negative	 effect	 on	 our	 progress	 and	 training.	 But	 it	 is	 good	 to	 see	 you,”	 she added	as	Dodds	pulled	a	face.	Estelle	had	a	tendency	to	put	her	career	before	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">friends,	something	that	appeared	to	not	have	waned	at	all	during	his	absence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let's	 walk,”	 Estelle	 said.	 “I'll	 show	 you	 around	 and	 bring	 you	 up	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">speed.”	The	pair	started	down	the	brick	path	that	led	to	their	housing	block,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">walkway	 splitting	 and	 snaking	 its	 away	 all	 about	 the	 research	 campus	 to	 other buildings	and	areas	contained	within. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	to	be	back?”	Estelle	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 is,	 actually,”	 Dodds	 said	 with	 a	 bit	 of	 a	 sigh.	 “I	 spent	 five	 months	 on Earth	with	my	parents,	picking	apples.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How's	the	business?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Steady.	 They	 think	 they'll	 have	 a	 good	 harvest	 this	 year,”	 Dodds	 stopped</p>
<p class="calibre1">short	of	telling	Estelle	about	how	his	parents	had	suggested	he	consider	a	career</p>
<p class="calibre1">change	to	work	their	fields,	instead	of	returning	to	the	Navy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>They	made	their	way	down	a	set	of	wide	stone	steps,	leading	down	to	the lower	 areas	 of	 the	 campus	 and	 towards	 the	 main	 research	 buildings.	 The	 vast majority	of	the	construction	was	made	up	of	tall	glass	buildings.	Small	trees	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">lamp	posts	lined	the	paths	they	walked,	complimented	by	grass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Men	and	women	dressed	in	everything	from	suits	to	casual	attire	and	white</p>
<p class="calibre1">lab	 coats	 walked	 past	 them,	 chatting	 to	 one	 another,	 drinking	 from	 polystyrene cups	and	going	about	their	business. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How's	 it	 going	 here?”	 Dodds	 asked.	 Parks	 had	 not	 been	 too	 forthcoming</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	details,	only	to	let	him	know	of	the	briefing	that	afternoon	and	the	start	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	program	the	following	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	 little	 better	 than	 I	 expected,	 although	 there's	 still	 room	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">improvement,”	 Estelle	 said	 as	 she	 leafed	 through	 the	 sheets	 of	 paper	 she	 was carrying.	 Dodds	 saw	 that	 the	 pages	 were	 packed	 full	 of	 graphs,	 pie	 charts	 and other	 statistical	 information,	 each	 headed	 with	 a	 different	 pilot's	 name.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">noticed	she	had	already	attacked	them	with	a	red	pen,	circling	various	numbers</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	writing	scruffy	and	hurried	notes.	“We've	only	been	here	for	a	few	days,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 training	 starts	 first	 thing	 tomorrow	 morning.	 You'll	 have	 to	 get	 into	 a simulator	for	the	rest	of	the	day	to	get	back	up	to	speed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	frowned.	“I'm	not	sure	I'll	be	as	bad	as	all	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	Dodds,	you	will	be,”	Estelle	said.	“There	was	a	guy	a	few	years	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">who	broke	both	his	legs.	When	he	eventually	got	back	into	the	seat	it	took	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">weeks	to	get	used	to	it	again.	It's	not	like	riding	a	bike.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 wasn't	 so	 sure.	 He	 had	 doubts	 that	 his	 time	 out	 of	 the	 cockpit,	 and away	from	the	stick,	would	have	impacted	his	flying	standard	as	much	as	Estelle</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	suggesting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 did	 you	 think	 when	 they	 picked	 us	 to	 come	 here?”	 Dodds	 asked, </p>
<p class="calibre1">changing	the	subject. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	 gave	 a	 small	 chuckle.	 “When	 they	 first	 told	 us	 that	 we	 were	 being</p>
<p class="calibre1">transferred,	I	was	worried	we	were	going	to	get	posted	to	border	patrol	duty.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	wouldn't	exactly	have	been	much	fun.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	 I	 couldn't	 think	 of	 anything	 worse.	 They've	 been	 shifting	 people</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	to	the	Temper	system	a	lot	lately.	When	did	you	actually	get	back?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	this	morning.	I	received	a	request	from	Commodore	Parks	to	return	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">duty	yesterday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	was	quick,”	Estelle	said.	“You	must	have	been	pretty	keen	to	get	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	started	to	saying	something,	then	stopped	walking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	studied	him	for	a	moment	as	he	looked	about.	“What?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	sighed,	then	shook	his	head.	“But	I	had	to,	didn't	I?	I	have	to	make</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>amends.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmmmmm,”	Estelle	scowled	for	a	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	being	serious,	Estelle.	Hardly	a	day	goes	by	where	I	don't	think	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	happened.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	said	nothing,	but	looked	about	the	campus.	She	soon	turned	back	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">him,	now	appearing	a	little	sympathetic.	“How	do	you	plan	to	do	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	know,”	Dodds	shook	his	head	again.	“I'll	find	a	way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	if	you	ask	me	you	could	try	just	following	orders.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">So	I	keep	being	told</i>,	Dodds	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	 said	 nothing	 more	 on	 the	 subject	 and	 the	 pair	 continued	 walking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 both	 knew	 that,	 whilst	 he	 was	 a	 good	 pilot,	 Dodds	 had	 a	 tendency	 to	 be reckless,	and	it	was	that	recklessness	which	from	time	to	time	led	to	undesirable</p>
<p class="calibre1">consequences. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	began	to	point	out	some	of	the	buildings	on	the	campus:	the	housing</p>
<p class="calibre1">blocks	 for	 the	 on	 site	 staff;	 a	 number	 of	 research	 buildings	 that	 they	 were	 not authorised	 to	 enter;	 a	 large	 lecture	 theatre,	 where	 they	 would	 attend	 the	 ATAF</p>
<p class="calibre1">presentation;	and	a	few	large,	square	buildings	that	housed	the	simulators. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anything	interesting	happen	whilst	I've	been	away?”	Dodds	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	chuckled.	“You	mean	aside	from	what	happened	to	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	happened	to	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	stopped	walking.	“You	mean	no-one's	told	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds'	initial	belief	that	Estelle	was	about	to	regale	him	with	some	useless</p>
<p class="calibre1">trivia	 about	 the	 enormous	 battleship	 was	 quashed	 by	 the	 look	 on	 the	 woman's face.	“Told	me	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	been	stolen!	It	hasn't	been	seen	or	heard	from	for	months!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>?	 The	 battleship?”	 he	 looked	 at	 her	 sceptically	 for	 a	 moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You're	being	serious,	aren't	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	nodded.	“Didn't	Parks	tell	you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	seemed...	distracted,”	Dodds	said,	remembering	how,	after	the	two	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">departed	the	waiting	room,	Parks	had	seemed	eager	to	return	to	other	business, </p>
<p class="calibre1">saying	 very	 little.	 “He	 didn't	 speak	 to	 me	 about	 anything	 other	 than	 getting through	my	medical	and	getting	me	down	here.	What	happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 disappeared	 a	 few	 weeks	 after	 your	 court-mar...	 after	 you	 left,”	 Estelle said.	Dodds	noted	how	she	doubled	back	and	skirted	around	the	touchy	subject</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	his	court-martial.	Though	she	had	not	been	on	trial	herself,	he	knew	the	many</p>
<p class="calibre1">hours	 sitting	 in	 the	 courtroom,	 delivering	 evidence	 and	 being	 cross	 examined, was	not	an	experience	she	had	relished,	wanted	reminding	of,	or	ever	wanted	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">go	through	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 just	 disappeared?”	 Dodds	 said.	 “That	 ship's	 not	 exactly	 small	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>defenceless.	Did	someone	just	take	it	out	of	dry	dock?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 happened	 in	 Independent	 space,	 near	 the	 Independent-Imperial	 border. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	what	I've	heard	it	was	a	hijacking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	the	hell	was	it	doing	all	the	way	out	there?”	Dodds	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No-one	knows.	Seems	that	information	is	classified,”	Estelle	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	came	to	a	tall,	circular	fountain,	water	spraying	out	of	the	top.	Estelle</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	Dodds	joined	a	few	people	sat	around	it,	enjoying	a	mid-morning	break	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	work,	reading	and	chatting	to	one	another.	The	two	CSN	pilots	made	sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 put	 a	 good	 amount	 of	 space	 either	 side	 of	 them	 so	 they	 could	 talk	 with	 a little	more	privacy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	they	know	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	was	hijacked	and	nothing	else	happened	to	it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Were	there	any	witnesses	or	survivors?”	Dodds	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only	 one:	 Commodore	 Hawke.	 He	 was	 captain	 at	 the	 time.	 And	  <i class="calibre4">no</i>, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds,	he	wasn't	involved,”	Estelle	put	in,	as	Dodds	roll	his	eyes	at	the	mention</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	man's	name.	“They	found	him	drifting	through	Confederation	space	in	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">escape	pod,	a	week	after	they	lost	contact	with	the	ship.	The	pod	didn't	have	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">food,	 water	 or	 medical	 supplies,	 and	 the	 stasis	 capsules	 had	 been	 smashed	 up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawke	himself	had	been	badly	wounded	and	suffering	from	blood	loss.	He	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">lucky	to	be	alive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No-one	else	survived?”	Dodds	asked,	mystified.	Though	he	had	never	laid</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes	 on	 the	 vessel	 himself,	 having	 only	 seen	 it	 in	 archive	 footage	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">photographs,	he	knew	enough	about	the	Confederation	Stellar	Navy's	flagship	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">know	that	the	event	of	its	theft	was	quite	worrisome.  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	was	the	largest	and most	powerful	starship	in	existence,	second	to	none.	Owing	to	its	size,	firepower, </p>
<p class="calibre1">starfighter	 and	 troop	 capacities,	 its	 mere	 arrival	 within	 a	 battle	 zone	 had	 been known	 to	 cause	 the	 opposing	 forces	 to	 make	 a	 hasty	 retreat	 or	 even	 surrender. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Attempting	to	fight	it	was	usually	never	worthwhile.	It	was	so	heavily	armoured</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	shielded	that	the	best	defence	against	it	was	to	be	nowhere	near	it.	If	a	battle</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	unavoidable,	other	capital	ships,	such	as	frigates	and	carriers,	stood	a	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">better	chance	of	survival	due	to	their	own	increased	capabilities,	though	it	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	 be	 a	 somewhat	 one-sided	 battle.	 Dodds	 knew	 of	 only	 one	 other	 ship	 that stood	 a	 chance	 of	 taking	 on	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>:	  <i class="calibre4">Minotaur</i>,	 flagship	 of	 the	 Imperial	 Naval Forces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	there	weren't	any	other	survivors,	he	was	the	only	one,”	Estelle	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">keeping	her	voice	low. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	Hawke	tell	anyone	what	happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He	says	he	can't	remember	much	before	waking	up	in	the	escape	pod.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">recalls	 a	 large	 boarding	 party	 appearing	 out	 of	 nowhere	 and	 storming	 all	 the major	divisions	simultaneously.  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	 was	 operating	 with	 a	 full	 complement, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>but	they	were	completely	overcome.	Hawke	believes	they	were	in	jump	space	at the	time,	so	no-one	is	sure	just	how	accurate	his	story	is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	were	in	 <i class="calibre4">jump</i>?	No,	that's...	well,	it's	not	impossible,	but	it's	extremely dangerous.	They	could	have	stranded	both	themselves	and	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	in	the	middle</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	nowhere.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	nodded.	“I	find	some	of	it	hard	to	believe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You're	not	the	only	one.	Exactly	how	did	they	get	aboard	in	the	first	place? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Who	 were	 these	 people?”	 They	 spoke	 for	 a	 while,	 discussing	 the	 possibilities, none	of	which	Estelle	had	not	already	considered	herself.	They	concluded	that	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">may	 have	 been	 a	 faction	 from	 the	 Imperial	 civil	 war,	 though	 given	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>'s almost	 legendary	 status	 throughout	 the	 galaxy,	 even	 that	 seemed	 rather	 far-fetched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 sometime,	 Estelle	 suggested	 to	 Dodds	 that	 they	 should	 leave	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fountain.	 They	 started	 walking	 along	 the	 brick	 pathways,	 Dodds	 noting	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sizeable	wall	that	ran	the	entire	perimeter	of	the	campus,	effectively	shutting	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	 from	 the	 outside	 world.	 Though	 he	 had	 only	 been	 at	 the	 research	 centre	 a little	under	an	hour,	Dodds	had	counted	no	less	than	ten	pairs	of	armed	personnel</p>
<p class="calibre1">patrolling	the	grounds.	The	young	pilot	said	nothing	as	they	continued	to	walk, </p>
<p class="calibre1">still	trying	to	put	together	the	pieces	of	a	large	and	complicated	puzzle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Would	have	made	your	day	if	Commodore	Hawke	hadn't	returned	either, </p>
<p class="calibre1">wouldn't	it?”	Estelle	commented. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	can't	say	you're	very	fond	of	the	man	yourself,”	Dodds	replied.	Estelle</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 had	 her	 own	 brushes	 with	 Hawke,	 either	 as	 a	 result	 of	 her	 own	 actions	 or because	of	those	under	her	command.	Owing	to	her	nature	she	was	much	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">adept	at	handling	such	meetings,	although	those	methods	quite	often	came	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">many	 variations	 of	 “Yes,	 sir!”,	 “No,	 sir!”,	 “Sorry,	 sir!”,	 and	 “It	 won't	 happen again,	sir!”. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	find	it's	best	to	try	and	stay	on	the	right	side	of	him,”	Estelle	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	side	would	that	be?”	Dodds	enquired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	 follow	 the	 chain	 of	 command,	 Dodds.”	 Estelle's	 voice	 was	 close	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">taking	on	a	tired	and	irritable	tone.	“And	please;	don't	either	you	or	Enrique	start</p>
<p class="calibre1">leading	each	other	astray.	This	is	a	fantastic	opportunity	we've	been	granted	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	should	all	act	like	true	professionals.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 decided	 it	 was	 time	 to	 let	 the	 topic	 lie.	 “So,	 what's	 the	 new	 guy</p>
<p class="calibre1">like?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chaz?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	I	spoke	to	him	before	you	arrived.	He	seems	a	little...	distant?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He's	 very	 quiet,”	 Estelle	 mused.	 Dodds	 got	 the	 impression	 she	 was	 still</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying	to	figure	the	man	out	for	herself.	“He's	a	good	pilot,	not	as	good	as	you	or</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>Kelly,	but	he	still	gels	well	with	the	team.	He	used	to	fly	with	a	group	called	the <i class="calibre4">Copper	Beetles</i>.	His	team	have	been	shuffled	around.	They	assigned	him	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	and	the	others	were	transferred	to	Earth.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Guess	 I'll	 get	 to	 know	 him	 better	 during	 the	 training	 then,”	 Dodds</p>
<p class="calibre1">remarked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	 shook	 her	 head.	 “Wouldn't	 bet	 on	 it.	 He's	 been	 with	 us	 for	 three</p>
<p class="calibre1">weeks	 and	 that's	 all	 I've	 managed	 to	 get	 out	 of	 him.	 He's	 nice	 though,	 if	 a	 bit grumpy.	Likes	to	read,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 pair	 had	 walked	 a	 fair	 way	 and	 Estelle	 suggested	 they	 head	 back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	asked	Estelle	what	she	knew	about	the	ATAF	project,	but	it	seemed	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	knowledge	on	the	subject	was	as	good	as	his. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Returning	to	the	dormitory,	they	found	that	Enrique,	Kelly	and	Chaz	were	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 their	 original	 places.	 The	 accommodation	 of	 the	 campus	 was	 better	 than</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	was	used	to:	the	dormitory	was	bright	and	spacious	and,	from	the	looks	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">things,	 sported	 much	 cleaner	 and	 improved	 washing	 facilities.	 He	 grabbed	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">bag	from	the	bed	and	began	to	sort	through	his	belonging,	pulling	things	out	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">dumping	them	onto	the	mattress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	 cleared	 her	 throat	 in	 an	 authoritative	 manner.	 She	 shuffled	 through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	papers	in	her	hands	and	then	addressed	the	group	as	a	whole, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay	 everyone,	 listen	 up.	 We've	 still	 got	 a	 lot	 to	 do	 before	 tomorrow</p>
<p class="calibre1">morning.	The	simulator	results	are	extremely	positive	and	we're	all	doing	much</p>
<p class="calibre1">better	than	we	were	yesterday	on	the	advanced	courses,	but	there's	still	room	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">improvement.	 We	 can	 get	 times	 down,	 minimise	 ally	 and	 ammunition	 losses... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly,	could	you	stop	writing	for	just	one	second	until	I	have	finished	speaking, </p>
<p class="calibre1">please?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly	put	down	her	digital	journal,	pushing	it	down	the	bed	and	out	of	reach</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 good	 measure,	 before	 giving	 the	 first	 lieutenant	 her	 undivided	 attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	feigned	an	irritation	around	his	eye,	looking	away	from	his	team	mates	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	saw	Estelle's	domineering	side	starting	to	creep	in.	Although	Estelle	liked	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">treat	 those	 in	 her	 command	 as	 friends,	 she	 was	 never	 afraid	 to	 pull	 rank	 to	 get the	 point	 across.	 Things	 had	 not	 changed	 much	 with	 her	 over	 the	 past	 five</p>
<p class="calibre1">months	either	then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“After	 lunch	 and	 the	 presentation,	 I	 want	 us	 to	 go	 back	 over	 simulation</p>
<p class="calibre1">courses	A4,	A9,	A15	and	A19...”	Estelle	continued. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>Enrique	groaned	and	looked	to	the	windows,	at	the	warm	afternoon	sun	that was	streaming	on	through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We're	not	here	on	vacation,	Enrique,”	Estelle	snapped	at	the	man.	“In	fact, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds,	you	need	to	get	on	those	sims	ASAP	to	work	out	the	rust.	Enrique	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">go	with	you	and	give	you	a	hand	setting	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique	 stifled	 another	 groan	 and	 pulled	 himself	 to	 his	 feet.	 “Come	 on, </p>
<p class="calibre1">man,	 let's	 go,”	 he	 indicated	 to	 Dodds	 as	 he	 walked	 over	 to	 join	 him.	 Estelle flourished	a	red	pen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I've	not	been	over	everything,”	she	said,	tapping	the	papers.	“But	I'm	sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	I'm	done	with	these	we'll	be	able	to...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'll	go,	too,”	Chaz	announced,	swinging	his	legs	off	his	bunk	and	jumping</p>
<p class="calibre1">down.	“I've	never	flown	with	Dodds	before,	so	the	sooner	I	see	what	he	can	do, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	better	we	can	exploit	our	strengths	and	cover	our	weaknesses.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	held	a	bemused	look	as	the	big	man	hurried	towards	Dodds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	 good	 point,”	 Kelly	 said.	 “I	 think	 that	 having	 more	 familiar</p>
<p class="calibre1">wingmates	 will	 help	 Dodds	 to	 get	 back	 up	 to	 speed	 much	 sooner	 than...	 uh... </p>
<p class="calibre1">unfamiliar	ones.”	She	hopped	off	her	bed,	and	squeezed	herself	between	Enrique</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	Chaz	to	get	to	Dodds,	taking	one	of	the	man's	arms	and	herding	him	out	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">quarters.	“No	time	to	waste	now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	them,	Enrique	and	Chaz	hurried	along	and	the	four	bustled	out	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dormitory,	past	Estelle	who	watched	them	go	with	a	flabbergasted	expression	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'll	meet	you	in	the	simulation	suite	just	before	lunch,”	Estelle	called	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	 as	 they	 disappeared	 down	 the	 corridor,	 towards	 the	 exit	 of	 the	 housing block. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 don't	 worry,	 we'll	 meet	 you	 in	 the	 refectory,”	 Kelly	 called	 back</p>
<p class="calibre1">without	turning	around.	“That	was	a	close	one,”	she	said	in	a	low	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	tell	me	about,”	Enrique	said,	then	turned	to	Dodds.	“Seriously,	mate, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	can't	believe	she	used	to	be	your	girlfriend.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">T</b>he	simulator	suite	to	which	Dodds	was	escorted	was	contained	within	a	large</p>
<p class="calibre1">square	glass	building,	its	central	expansive	floor	home	to	a	large	number	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">systems.	 Each	 simulator	 itself	 was	 self	 contained,	 to	 guard	 against	 any	 visual distractions.	 The	 interior	 of	 each	 was	 an	 exact	 replica	 of	 the	 designated	 craft, with	readouts	and	consoles	all	working	as	expected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	the	most	part,	the	shiny	white	suite	floor	was	devoid	of	anything	except</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 the	 modules,	 whilst	 a	 high	 gallery	 of	 observation	 rooms	 and	 offices	 ran around	the	perimeter.	Staff	milled	around	inside,	performing	various	tasks.	After</p>
<p class="calibre1">explaining	their	requirements	to	a	staff	member,	Enrique	and	Dodds	made	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	over	to	a	TAF	module. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 sat	 down	 in	 the	 seat	 and	 buckled	 himself	 in,	 the	 screens	 inside</p>
<p class="calibre1">powering	 up	 to	 display	 a	 convincing	 astral	 scene	 all	 around	 him.	 The	 HUD</p>
<p class="calibre1">activated	 and	 control	 consoles	 lit	 up	 as	 they	 prepared	 themselves.	 A	 sense	 of familiarity	came	back	to	Dodds.	He	reached	forward	and	expertly	configured	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fighter's	HUD	to	the	way	he	preferred,	before	informing	the	simulation	operator</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	he	was	ready	to	begin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	 his	 dismay,	 Dodds	 found	 that	 he	 was,	 just	 as	 Estelle	 had	 predicted, </p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhat	 rusty	 on	 the	 simulator.	 The	 months	 away	 from	 duty	 had	 led	 to	 him</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgetting	some	of	the	more	intricate	principles	of	space	flight	and	combat,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	found	himself	stalling	from	time	to	time.	But	he	focused	and	an	hour	later	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	well	on	the	way	to	returning	to	his	original	form.	He	embarked	on	a	series</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 courses,	 each	 designed	 to	 work	 on	 various	 aspects	 of	 his	 skills,	 from	 flight handling	 to	 basic	 target	 practice.	 After	 sometime,	 Enrique,	 Kelly	 and	 Chaz</p>
<p class="calibre1">joined	 him	 on	 a	 simple	 training	 mission,	 working	 as	 a	 team	 to	 fulfil	 various objectives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 discovered	 during	 the	 course	 of	 the	 exercise	 that	 Chaz's	 alleged</p>
<p class="calibre1">silence	made	the	transition	to	the	cockpit,	and	whilst	the	others	would	engage	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	kinds	of	genial	banter	and	teasing,	Chaz's	voice	lent	itself	only	when	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>required	 of	 him.	 Despite	 this,	 Dodds	 found	 that	 the	 man	 was	 an	 accomplished pilot	and	worked	well	with	the	rest	of	the	team. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	mission	took	the	best	part	of	an	hour	to	complete,	by	which	time	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	all	grateful	for	a	break	and	some	food. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Making	 their	 way	 into	 the	 refectory	 after	 Estelle	 joined	 them,	 Dodds	 felt	 quite out	of	place,	the	five	pilots	being	the	only	military	personnel	present.	The	tables</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	packed	full	of	casual	and	suit	attired	staff,	a	smattering	of	white	coats	here</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	there.	More	walked	around	carrying	their	meals	on	trays. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	 there	 anyone	 else	 here?”	 Dodds	 asked	 as	 he	 sat	 down	 to	 eat	 whatever</p>
<p class="calibre1">delights	Xalan's	research	staff	were	given	for	lunch.	He	had	yet	to	see	any	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">servicemen	and	couldn't	help	but	feel	that	he	was	missing	out	on	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Two	 other	 teams,”	 Estelle	 said,	 confirming	 what	 Parks	 had	 told	 him</p>
<p class="calibre1">earlier,	whilst	holding	up	a	fork	full	of	mashed	potatoes,	dripping	in	gravy.	“But</p>
<p class="calibre1">we're	being	kept	apart;	something	about	the	segregation	enabling	us	to	function</p>
<p class="calibre1">better	as	a	team	and	provide	us	with	fewer	distractions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure	 it	 will,”	 Dodds	 replied	 as	 an	 attractive,	 petite	 brunette	 brushed	 past his	chair,	their	eyes	meeting	for	a	brief	moment.	She	looked	away,	but	smiled	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	continued	walking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	tutted	before	going	on	to	question	Dodds	as	to	his	performance	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	simulators	for	the	rest	of	the	meal,	asking	every	conceivable	question	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	progress.	She	was	quite	disappointed	to	discover	he	had	not	brought	back	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">analytics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finishing,	 the	 team	 stashed	 their	 trays	 on	 a	 rack	 and	 left	 the	 refectory, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	steering	them	in	the	direction	of	the	central	lecture	theatre	to	attend	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	lecture	theatre,	like	the	other	areas	of	the	facility	Dodds	had	visited	that	day, </p>
<p class="calibre1">had	a	far	larger	capacity	than	their	needs	demanded.	Positioned	centrally	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">rows	of	red	steepled	seating,	and	close	to	the	front,	were	ten	other	people,	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">must	have	been	the	other	teams. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>“Ah,	you	must	be...	um...	you	are..	the	 <i class="calibre4">White	Knights</i>?”	a	voice	boomed	out over	the	theatre	speakers.	A	tall	suited	man	stood	behind	the	podium	at	the	front, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 his	 back	 to	 a	 large	 screen	 covering	 the	 wall.	 To	 one	 side	 of	 him	 sat	 two other	 men,	 one	 of	 whom	 was	 Parks.	 “If	 you're	 all	 ready	 then...	 er..	 please	 take your	seats	and	I	will	begin	the...	the	presentation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,	come	on,”	Estelle	muttered,	ushering	her	team	into	their	seats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Estelle,	we're	early,	relax,”	Dodds	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	about	fifteen	minutes	early,”	Kelly	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	but	the	other	teams	are	already	here,”	Estelle	replied,	before	insisting</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	dictating	the	seating	arrangement	so	that	she	could	sit	herself	in	the	middle	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	team. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	was	already	beginning	to	feel	sorry	for	the	others,	having	had	to	put</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	with	her	perfection-seeking	attitude	for	three	intense	days	already.	Sadly,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew	 that	 with	 their	 formal	 training	 starting	 the	 following	 day,	 it	 was	 going	 to get	 a	 lot	 worse	 before	 it	 got	 any	 better.	 And	 should	 they	 succeed	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">evaluations	 and	 have	 the	 opportunity	 to	 pilot	 these	 new	 starfighters,	 Estelle could	become	unbearable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,”	began	the	lecturer,	“may	I	first	welcome	you	to	the	Obex	Research</p>
<p class="calibre1">Centre	 here	 on	 Xalan	 and	 er...	 tulate...	 all...”	 His	 words	 became	 inaudible</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	 his	 mumbling.	 The	 speaker	 looked	 around	 as	 Parks	 said	 something	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.	He	cleared	his	throat	and	went	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“...congratulate	 you	 all	 on	 your	 selection	 to	 become	 the	 first	 to	 pilot	 the Confederation's	newest	and	most	advanced	starfighter...	um...	My	my	my	name</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	James	Ainsworth	and...	er...	I	am	the	chief	engineer	on	the	ATAF	project.	This</p>
<p class="calibre1">is	 Scott	 Mansun,”	 he	 indicated	 to	 the	 man	 seated	 just	 behind	 him,	 “the	 project leader,	and	you	all	know	Commodore	Parks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,	um...	I	know	you'll	probably	have	a	lot	more	questions,	b...	but,	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 could	 hold	 off	 from	 asking	 them...	 erm...	 until	 the	 end	 of	 the	 presentation, and	then	Scott	will...	will	gladly	take	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably	a	good	idea,”	Dodds	whispered	to	Enrique,	sat	next	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ainsworth	studied	the	podium	for	a	moment,	appearing	unsure	about	how	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">operated.	 He	 pushed	 a	 button	 and	 then	 jumped	 when	 it	 did	 not	 do	 as	 he	 had expected:	his	microphone	cutting	off	and	classical	music	beginning	to	stream	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	the	hall's	speakers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	God,	this	is	going	to	take	hours...”	Enrique	murmured,	as	a	befuddled</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ainsworth,	 aided	 by	 Mansun,	 attempted	 to	 regain	 control	 of	 his	 presentation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 were	 some	 stifled	 chuckles	 from	 the	 other	 teams	 and	 Dodds	 wondered</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	Ainsworth	must	be	like	when	the	lecture	theatre	was	full. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ainsworth	was	a	tall,	thin-looking	man	with	pasty	white	skin.	His	head	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>covered	 in	 lank,	 long	 blond	 hair	 that	 fell	 just	 short	 of	 his	 shoulders.	 A	 gold earring	sparkled	in	the	light	as	he	turned	his	head.	Dodds	got	the	impression	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	was	the	sort	of	man	who	had	never	quite	found	the	strength	to	sever	his	ties</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	his	earlier	hedonistic	years,	even	after	embarking	on	what	seemed	like	quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	illustrious	career. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I...	 I'm	 sorry	 about	 that,”	 Ainsworth	 said	 as	 the	 music	 ceased.	 “I'm	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1">used	 to	 this	 theatre.”	 With	 the	 presentation	 back	 in	 his	 control,	 Ainsworth</p>
<p class="calibre1">pressed	the	correct	buttons	on	the	podium	and	the	lights	began	to	dim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	looked	over	at	the	other	teams	as	the	light	level	lowered,	seeing	that, </p>
<p class="calibre1">unlike	 the	  <i class="calibre4">White	 Knights</i>,	 the	 other	 two	 teams	 were	 both	 single-sex.	 Five	 men and	five	women	were	seated	together	and	Dodds	wondered	if	this	was	again	part</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 team	 selection.	 Maybe	 the	 Navy	 wished	 to	 discover	 if	 a	 single-sex	 team was	more	suited	to	the	project	and	its	long	term	goals.	But	there	again,	it	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	be	pure	coincidence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 not	 one	 face	 amongst	 the	 team	 of	 women	 that	 he	 recognised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	turned	her	head	in	his	direction,	a	contented	smile	on	her	face.	She	did	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">meet	his	eyes,	however,	and	faced	back	to	the	front.	He	guessed	she	was	doing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	same	thing	that	he	was:	sizing	up	the	competition.	Neither	did	he	recognise</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	 of	 the	 men;	 two	 olive-skinned	 men	 seated	 at	 the	 end	 of	 their	 row	 were whispering	to	each	other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	lights	didn't	shut	off,	but	instead	dipped	only	to	a	level	in	which	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">did	 not	 drown	 out	 the	 presentation	 screen	 at	 the	 front.	 Dodds	 hoped	 that	 he would	not	find	himself	with	an	elbow	in	the	ribs	from	Estelle	after	falling	asleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 felt	 as	 though	 he	 was	 in	 a	 warm,	 comfortable	 cinema	 and	 he	 sensed	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">impending	danger,	even	more	so	after	such	a	filling	lunch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ladies	 and	 gentlemen,	 I	 give	 you	 the	 Advanced	 Tactical	 Assault	 Fighter, </p>
<p class="calibre1">more	commonly	known	as	the	ATAF,”	Ainsworth	began.	“It	is	the...	er...	spiritual</p>
<p class="calibre1">successor	 to	 the	 standard	 Tactical	 Assault	 Fighter	 which	 you	 all	 know	 so	 well, though	with	many	enhancements	as...	as	we	are	about	to	see.	I'm	sure	that	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	 find	 the	 following	 presentation	 t-t-to	 be	 both	 very	 informative	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">impressive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	 presentation	 started,	 the	 screen	 showing	 a	 sleek,	 black	 starfighter	 moving against	a	backdrop	of	planets,	nebulas	and	starships.	It	appeared	to	be	a	mixture</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	artists'	impressions	and	real	footage	of	the	fighter,	as	it	weaved	its	way	around</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>other	Confederation	starfighters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	were	no	official	markings	or	identifiers	on	the	craft,	the	black	armour</p>
<p class="calibre1">complimented	 only	 by	 silver	 trims	 on	 the	 wings,	 fins	 and	 body.	 Despite	 being more	 or	 less	 black,	 the	 definition	 of	 the	 fighter	 was	 not	 lost	 against	 the	 inky-darkness	 of	 space,	 the	 armour	 catching	 the	 light	 and	 softly	 reflecting	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">environment	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	the	introduction	over,	Ainsworth	went	on	to	speak	at	length	about	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">new	 fighter.	 He	 was	 keen	 to	 point	 out	 that	 the	 ATAF,	 though	 descended	 from, was	 quite	 different	 from	 its	 TAF	 cousin	 and	 was	 not	 just	 “a	 TAF	 with	 more guns”,	as	he	put	it.	Over	the	next	two	hours,	he	detailed	each	and	every	aspect	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	craft,	focusing	on	enhancements	which	he	thought	the	pilots	would	find	most</p>
<p class="calibre1">appealing:	a	HUD	that	featured	a	predictive	targeting	matrix,	allowing	the	pilot</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 aim	 for	 where	 their	 opponent	 would	 be,	 rather	 than	 where	 they	 were;	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">arsenal	 that	 was	 made	 up	 of	 significantly	 more	 powerful	 armaments	 than	 its</p>
<p class="calibre1">predecessor;	 a	 much	 higher	 acceleration	 rate	 and	 top	 speed;	 and	 a	 shield</p>
<p class="calibre1">generation	unit	that	was	many	times	more	efficient. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 detail	 of	 the	 each	 enhancement	 was	 accompanied	 by	 video	 footage, </p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 of	 it	 set	 planet	 side,	 the	 rest	 in	 space.	 Whatever	 the	 backdrop,	 most involved	something	exploding	in	rather	dramatic	fashion. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">With	 his	 presentation	 concluded,	 Ainsworth	 thanked	 his	 audience	 and	 moved</p>
<p class="calibre1">away	from	the	podium.	No-one	had	attempted	to	ask	any	questions,	but	Dodds</p>
<p class="calibre1">noticed	that	all	around	him	people	were	gaping;	all	that	was,	with	the	exception</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	Chaz.	The	big	man	had	sat	through	most	of	the	presentation	with	a	deadpan</p>
<p class="calibre1">expression	 on	 his	 face,	 slouched	 down	 a	 little	 in	 his	 seat	 and	 his	 arms	 folded across	his	chest.	He	didn't	look	all	that	interested	or	even	impressed	at	what	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 being	 shown.	 Dodds	 wondered	 why.	 At	 the	 very	 least,	 he	 would	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">expected	to	see	a	flicker	of	curiosity.	Maybe	he	held	the	same	point	of	view	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds:	something	about	this	didn't	look	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dude,	 I'm	 finding	 this	 a	 little	 hard	 to	 swallow,”	 Dodds	 whispered	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique's	ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	part?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which	 part?	 Well,	 where	 do	 I	 start?	 The	 bit	 about	 the	 accelerator	 or	 that that	flimsy-looking	crate	is	better	shielded	than	most	of	our	carriers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	 just	 the	 next	 evolutionary	 step	 up,”	 Enrique	 said.	 “They	 make	 these</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>sorts	 of	 advancements	 all	 the	 time.	 You	 can	 bet	 they're	 already	 working	 on	 the successor	to	that	one	in	a	lab	somewhere	else,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	frowned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You've	gotta	admit,	those	things	look	pretty	sweet,”	Enrique	added,	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">nod	towards	the	screen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know,	my	Dad	has	a	saying	-	 <i class="calibre4">Never	believe	everything	you	hear,	and</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">only	half	of	what	you	see</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	think	this	is	one	of	those	cases,	mate.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	well,	imagine	this...”	Dodds	started.	With	all	that	they	had	heard	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">afternoon,	 this	 starfighter,	 when	 compared	 to	 any	 other,	 was	 in	 essence	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">equivalent	 of	 taking	 an	 ordinary	 ground	 soldier	 and	 strapping	 a	 tank	 cannon	 to their	back.	Said	soldier	would	then	be	given	a	belt	holding	two	dozen	grenades, </p>
<p class="calibre1">before	 being	 presented	 with	 two	 shotguns,	 two	 pistols	 and	 two	 machine	 guns. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	 only	 would	 all	 the	 added	 weight	 be	 of	 no	 consequence	 to	 their	 ability	 to walk	 or	 otherwise	 move,	 nor	 in	 any	 way	 hinder	 their	 performance	 on	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">battlefield,	but	they	would	be	able	to	run	at	the	speed	of	a	top	class	athlete	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">survive	being	shot	many,	many	times	before	they	were	at	last	brought	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	hoped	the	image	of	such	a	man	leaping,	somersaulting	and	sprinting</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	 a	 torn,	 urban	 landscape	 would	 look	 so	 ludicrous,	 as	 to	 sway	 Enrique's opinion.	It	didn't. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Questions?”	Mansun,	having	taken	to	the	podium,	asked.	A	flurry	of	hands</p>
<p class="calibre1">went	up,	none	of	which	belonged	to	Dodds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 you.	 The	 young	 lady	 in	 the	 middle	 there.”	 A	 rather	 striking,	 tall</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman	with	curly	blonde	hair	stood	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“First	Lieutenant	Andrea	Kennedy,  <i class="calibre4">Red	Devils</i>,	sir,”	she	introduced	herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	aware	that	I'm	probably	about	to	ask	the	same	question	as	everyone	else	-” </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	looked	around	briefly	“-	but	I	have	to	know:	how	it	is	possible	that	you	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">managed	 to	 outfit	 a	 single	 man	 starfighter	 with	 a	 plasma	 accelerator?	 I	 mean, we're	talking	about	a	weapon	that	is	usually	only	found	on	cap	ships	and	orbital</p>
<p class="calibre1">defence	 platforms;	 something	 capable	 of	 cleaving	 a	 passenger	 vessel	 in	 two, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with	ease.	The	power	requirements	must	be	astronomical!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Yes,	how	</i> did <i class="calibre4">	you	do	that? </i>	Dodds	wondered.  <i class="calibre4">That's	not	technically	possible. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">A	part	of	him	was	intrigued,	but	another	part	of	him	was	feeling	a	little	uneasy.	A</p>
<p class="calibre1">three-dimensional	 image	 of	 the	 ATAF	 was	 continuing	 its	 idle	 rotation	 on	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">screen	 behind	 Mansun	 and	 he	 couldn't	 help	 but	 feel	 that	 he	 was	 looking	 upon something	that	shouldn't	be;	shouldn't	 <i class="calibre4">need</i>	to	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	thought	you	might	want	to	know	that,”	Mansun	answered	Andrea	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">wry	 smile.	 “But	 unfortunately	 I	 can't	 provide	 any	 more	 information	 right	 now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let's	 just	 say	 that	 we	 have	 access	 to	 some	 of	 the	 best	 architects	 and	 engineers</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>that	the	galaxy	can	currently	offer.	As	a	comparison,	you	must	remember	that	we are	also	able	to	travel	a	distance	of	many	hundred	light	years	in	the	space	of	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	few	hours,	something	that	was	also	considered	impossible	until	you	knew	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">trick.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 I	 have	 to	 say	 that	 I‘m	  <i class="calibre4">very</i>	 impressed,”	 Andrea	 beamed.	 “You	 and your	engineers	have	done	an	absolutely	incredible	job.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,”	Mansun	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 may	 I	 just	 add,	 on	 behalf	 of	 myself	 and	 my	 team,	 that	 it	 will	 be	 an honour	to	evaluate	the	Advanced	Tactical	Assault	Fighter	for	the	benefit	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Navy,”	 Andrea	 said,	 with	 another	 radiant	 smile	 that	 was	 now	 mimicked	 by	 her team	mates.	“Thank	you	for	giving	us	this	opportunity.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mansun	 gave	 a	 small	 chuckle,	 but	 did	 not	 answer.	 The	 project	 leader</p>
<p class="calibre1">clasped	at	the	back	of	his	neck	with	one	hand	and	turned	in	the	direction	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	seated	Parks.	He	was	clearly	a	little	embarrassed	and	was	attempted	to	avoid</p>
<p class="calibre1">eye	contact	with	his	admirer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 looked	 over	 at	 Andrea	 again	 as	 the	 woman	 settled	 back	 down	 into</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 seat.	 He	 found	 her	 quite	 beautiful,	 with	 sharp	 features	 and	 smooth	 white skin.	Even	now,	she	continued	to	wear	that	very	attractive	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mansun	 gave	 a	 cough	 and	 collected	 himself.	 “Any	 other	 questions?”	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">requested.	“If	not	then	I	will	wrap	up	this	portion	of	the	presentation	and	move</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	to	the	program	for	the	next	three	weeks.”	A	few	more	hands	went	up	from	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">three	teams,	with	various	questions	aimed	at	elaborating	more	on	various	aspects</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	starfighter.	After	answering	a	good	number,	Mansun	decided	it	was	best	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">press	on,	lest	they	spend	the	remainder	of	the	afternoon	stuck	in	the	lecture	hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	sure	any	other	questions	that	you	may	have	will	be	answered	once	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">training	 begins	 tomorrow	 morning,”	 he	 concluded	 and	 began	 to	 discuss	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">schedule	for	the	following	days'	training	and	eventual	graded	evaluations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaving	 the	 theatre,	 herded	 once	 more	 by	 Estelle	 in	 her	 eagerness	 to	 get</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	the	simulation	suite,	Dodds	was	left	with	one	question	that	he	had	refrained</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	asking.	It	seemed	to	him	that	the	Confederation	was	preparing	to	push	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bounds	of	military	force	and	technology	in	ways	that	had	not	been	heard	of	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">centuries;	even	more	so	during	peacetime.	His	question	was	“Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	found	the	initial	few	days	of	the	training	quite	straightforward.	The	group</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrived	at	their	simulation	suite	and	were	taken	through	a	number	of	basic	flight</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>programs.	The	simulated	ATAF	cockpit	layout	was	quite	similar	to	that	of	a	TAF</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	it	did	not	take	long	for	the	team	to	get	used	to	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Contrary	 to	 what	 Ainsworth	 had	 said,	 Dodds	 did	 feel	 that	 he	 really	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">flying	 a	 “TAF	 with	 more	 guns”,	 and	 it	 was	 not	 long	 before	 Estelle	 began</p>
<p class="calibre1">pressuring	the	group	to	move	on	to	more	advanced	techniques. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 the	 days	 progressed,	 the	 learning	 curve	 began	 to	 increase,	 until	 they</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	to	realise	that	more	than	a	week	had	passed	and	they	were	beginning	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">first	ungraded	training	exercise.	As	with	the	standard	simulator	tests,	they	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">required	 to	 undertake	 a	 series	 of	 missions,	 though	 within	 vastly	 inflated</p>
<p class="calibre1">constraints:	 a	 simple	 dogfight	 against	 six	 opponents	 ballooned	 into	 a	 struggle against	 over	 three	 dozen;	 the	 enemy	 supply	 line	 hit	 morphed	 into	 a	 strike	 run against	an	Imperial	frigate,	complete	with	escorts;	and	their	own	escort	mission</p>
<p class="calibre1">transformed	 into	 a	 monstrous	 operation	 involving	 the	 protection	 of	 a	 crippled carrier	against	an	onslaught	of	opposing	forces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	been	flying	anything	other	than	ATAFs,	many	of	the	tasks</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 have	 proven	 next	 to	 impossible.	 As	 it	 was,	 the	 benefits	 provided	 by	 the fighter	permitted	the	pilots	a	much	greater	fighting	chance;	though	not	always. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	 rather	 unrealistic	 combat	 simulation,”	 the	 training	 supervisor	 assured</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	 upon	 the	 team's	 first	 failure.	 “Doubtful	 that	 such	 a	 situation	 would	 ever arise	 in	 real	 life.	 When	 you're	 ready,	 you	 can	 attempt	 the	 mission	 again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Remember	 that	 most	 capital	 ships	 have	 some	 structurally	 vulnerable	 points.	 If you	 focus	 your	 attacks	 against	 those,	 then	 you	 should	 be	 able	 to	 bring	 it	 down with	relative	ease.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 clambered	 out	 of	 his	 module,	 the	 scene	 of	 the	 carrier	 breaking	 up</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	 projecting	 itself	 about	 the	 interior.	 The	 cannons	 of	 the	 frigate	 they	 were supposed	 to	 be	 defending	 it	 from	 were	 still	 ravaging	 the	 surface	 as	 he	 joined Estelle	by	the	training	supervisor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	we	use	the	accelerators?”	Estelle	asked,	trying	to	do	something	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 ruffled	 hair.	 Even	 though	 they	 had	 failed	 on	 their	 very	 first	 attempt,	 it	 was clear	 she	 was	 already	 becoming	 frustrated,	 wanting	 nothing	 more	 than	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">succeed	 on	 the	 first	 attempt,	 with	 flying	 colours.	 Dodds	 felt	 his	 shoulders	 sag and	 he	 turned	 wearily	 to	 Enrique,	 who	 let	 out	 a	 sigh,	 lowered	 his	 eyes	 to	 the floor	and	shook	his	head.	Kelly	also	appeared	drained,	even	more	so	than	Chaz, </p>
<p class="calibre1">both	 of	 their	 eyes	 starting	 to	 turn	 red.	 The	 strain	 of	 the	 non-stop	 exercises, staring	at	a	screen	for	well	over	an	hour	at	a	time,	and	having	to	concentrate	hard</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	everything	was	taking	its	toll.	It	was	a	long	time	to	sit	in	a	cockpit,	simulator</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	not,	without	a	break. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I'm	sorry,”	the	training	manager	shook	his	head.	“But	whilst	they	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	part	of	your	initial	training	and	familiarisation,	the	accelerators	aren't	a	part	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>these	 ungraded	 exercises,	 or	 the	 final	 evaluations,	 I'm	 afraid.	 Should	 you successfully	 complete	 the	 evaluation,	 and	 set	 yourselves	 apart	 from	 the	 other teams,	then	you	may	have	a	chance	to	use	them	during	real	life	training.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	made	sure	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	succeeded	on	the	next	attempt. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">After	many	hours	spent	in	the	modules,	the	final	few	days	were	upon	them	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">arriving	at	the	simulation	suite	the	group	were	met	by	Commodore	Parks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	morning,  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>,”	he	greeted	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	morning,	Commodore,”	Estelle	saluted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	you	were.	As	I'm	sure	you're	well	aware,	today	will	see	the	beginning</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 your	 last	 three	 days	 at	 this	 facility	 and	 also	 the	 first	 day	 of	 your	 graded evaluations.	Regardless	of	the	outcome	of	these	tests,	you	will	be	transferred	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Xalan's	Orbital	to	await	further	instruction.	Your	destination	from	there	will	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">determined	by	your	performance	here;	and	I	have	to	say,	Lieutenant	de	Winter, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 so	 far	 your	 team	 has	 performed	 far	 better	 in	 these	 evaluations	 than	 any	 of the	others.	I	am	expecting	good	things	from	you	over	the	next	few	days.	Good</p>
<p class="calibre1">luck,  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	sir,”	Estelle	said,	saluting	the	commodore	once	more	as	he	left</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	suite.	Estelle	turned	to	her	team,	her	eyes	bright. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	everyone.	This	is	it.	Let's	give	it	all	we've	got.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Four	days	later	the	 <i class="calibre4">White	Knights</i>	stood	before	Parks,	Ainsworth	and	Mansun	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 meeting	 room	 aboard	 Xalan's	 orbital	 station.	 As	 they	 waited	 before	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">commodore,	 Dodds	 glanced	 momentarily	 to	 Estelle,	 seeing	 the	 woman	 almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">bursting	with	pride.	She	caught	his	eye	and	gave	him	a	wink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 looked	 up.	 “I	 will	 keep	 this	 brief,”	 he	 began.	 “Your	 performance</p>
<p class="calibre1">throughout	 the	 entire	 evaluation	 period	 has	 been	 nothing	 less	 than	 exceptional; you	exceeded	expectations	in	almost	every	exercise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	sir,”	Estelle	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks'	 face	 remained	 expressionless.	 “However,	 compared	 with	 the	 final</p>
<p class="calibre1">test	results	of	the	other	teams,	you	did	not	perform	as	favourably.	I	realise	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>this	is	not	the	news	that	any	of	you	wished	to	hear	after	all	the	effort	you	have put	in,	and	on	no	account	should	you	hold	each	other	to	blame	for	this,”	his	eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">flickered	 to	 Estelle.	 “I'm	 sorry	 to	 say	 that	 as	 far	 as	 your	 participation	 in	 the ATAF	project	is	concerned,	you	will	not	be	proceeding	any	further.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	 was	 devastated,	 that	 much	 was	 obvious	 to	 Dodds,	 even	 above	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">poker	face	that	she	had	practised	for	years.	Inside	she	must	have	been	distraught. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique	and	Kelly	disguised	their	feelings	less	well,	disappointment	written	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	their	faces.	Rather	strange,	however,	was	that	despite	the	fact	that	Chaz	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">put	one	hundred	and	ten	percent	into	the	ATAF	evaluations,	the	big	man	didn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">seem	 bothered	 about	 the	 end	 of	 their	 participation	 in	 the	 project.	 In	 fact	 he almost	looked	–	relieved? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	continued.	“This	is	by	no	means	a	reflection	on	your	abilities;	unless</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	were	of	a	high	calibre,	you	would	not	have	been	selected	in	the	first	place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	 you,	 sir,”	 Estelle	 said,	 somehow	 managing	 to	 keep	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappointment	out	of	her	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds,	 Enrique	 and	 Kelly	 echoed	 her	 words.	 Dodds	 had	 half	 expected</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	 speech	 from	 Estelle,	 mimicking	 Andrea's	 speech	 in	 the	 lecture	 theatre and	thanking	the	commodore	for	the	opportunity	to	have	taken	part,	but	she	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Guess	we're	all	heading	back	to	Gabriel	then?”	Enrique	said,	half	to	Parks</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	half	to	his	team	mates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually,	 Mr	 Todd,	 from	 here	 all	 five	 of	 you	 will	 be	 transferred	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Temper	system...”	Parks	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">What? </i>”	Chaz	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	jumped	at	the	sound	of	the	man's	voice.	Not	least	of	all	because	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	not	that	used	to	hearing	it,	but	also	because	of	the	sheer	anger	that	seemed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">flow	from	the	man	like	red	hot	magma.	He	turned	to	look	at	the	man,	though	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">subconsciously	 leaned	 away.	 Chaz's	 eyes	 were	 narrowed,	 his	 face	 furious.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	almost	shooting	daggers	at	the	commodore	sat	before	him.	Dodds	glanced	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 team	 mates,	 noticing	 that	 they	 appeared	 every	 bit	 as	 surprised	 at	 the	 man's sudden	 outburst.	 Kelly,	 in	 particular,	 looked	 like	 a	 scared	 rabbit.	 On	 the	 other side	 of	 the	 desk,	 a	 shocked	 Ainsworth	 had	 begun	 tense	 fidgeting,	 looking	 with apprehension	over	to	Mansun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 <i class="calibre4">border</i>?”	Enrique	said,	once	the	shock	of	Chaz's	outburst	had	subsided</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough	for	the	added	impact	of	the	new	destination	to	sink	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 Mr	 Todd,	 the	 Confederation-Independent	 border,”	 Parks	 continued, </p>
<p class="calibre1">ignoring	Chaz.	“As	you	have	been	told	before	we	are	currently	suffering	from	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lack	 of	 personnel,	 and	 thus	 an	 inadequate	 supply	 of	 experienced	 starfighter</p>
<p class="calibre1">pilots.	You	also	need	to	remember	that	we	are	still	counting	the	cost	of	the	theft</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>of	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>.	 It's	 not	 just	 the	 loss	 of	 the	 battleship	 that's	 troublesome,	 but	 the disappearance	of	virtually	all	who	were	serving	aboard.	Those	numbers	include</p>
<p class="calibre1">several	hundred	starfighter	pilots,	all	of	the	highest	calibre	that	the	Confederacy</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 offer;	 a	 figure	 that,	 as	 I'm	 sure	 you	 can	 well	 imagine,	 doesn't	 replenish itself	overnight,	nor	even	within	six	months. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	experience	and	skills	will	therefore	be	invaluable	within	the	Temper</p>
<p class="calibre1">system.	Given	all	that	we	cannot	afford	to	have	you	stationed	anywhere	else	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	just	in	the	short-term,	sir?”	Kelly	ventured. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	shook	his	head.	“No.	Until	further	notice,	you	will	be	posted	to	Spirit, </p>
<p class="calibre1">where	you	will	fall	under	the	general	command	of	Captain	Meyers.	Preparations</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	your	departure	to	the	system	have	already	been	made,	and	your	transport	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	ready	to	go	within	the	next	quarter	of	an	hour.	Please	ensure	you	are	ready	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">leave	at	that	time.”	The	man's	voice	had	an	edge	of	finality	to	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Spirit.	Dodds	racked	his	brain	to	remember	it.	He	then	discovered	why	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 buried	 it	 so	 deep:	 the	 planet	 was	 supposedly	 run	 down	 and	 dilapidated, </p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing	 about	 it	 at	 all	 very	 appealing,	 not	 even	 the	 “notable”	 parts.	 Certain Confederation	planets	that	were	home	to	military	interests	were	wrapped	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">large	 orbital	 ring.	 Spirit's	 had	 been	 under	 construction	 for	 many	 years,	 but	 had never	been	completed.	It	had	fallen	into	disrepair	as	a	result.	The	orbital	station</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	hung	above	the	planet	was	all	there	was	to	service	the	CSN's	needs	and	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost	unable	to	handle	the	demands	placed	upon	it.	Dodds	suppressed	a	feeling</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	horror.	What	had	he	agreed	to	come	back	to? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mansun	 stepped	 forward.	 “On	 behalf	 of	 the	 research	 and	 development</p>
<p class="calibre1">teams	 at	 Xalan,	 I	 would	 like	 to	 thank	 you	 all	 for	 your	 work	 in	 helping	 us evaluate	the	ATAF,”	he	said,	shaking	their	hands	in	turn.	When	he	came	to	Chaz</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 let	 out	 a	 yelp,	 a	 clear	 look	 of	 discomfort	 on	 his	 face.	 Chaz's	 eyes	 were	 still narrowed	 and	 he	 looked	 to	 have	 a	 very	 tight	 grip	 on	 the	 man's	 hand.	 Mansun retreated	back,	nursing	his	injured	fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I...	er...	would	also	like	to	thank	you,”	Ainsworth	said.	“Erm...	than... </p>
<p class="calibre1">thank	you.”	He	gave	a	little	wave,	but	refused	to	move	away	from	the	safety	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	desk.	Parks	looked	to	him,	but	Ainsworth	only	gave	a	very	slight	shake	of	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 turned	 back	 to	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>.	 “Before	 you	 go:	 I	 shouldn't	 have	 to remind	 you	 that	 even	 though	 you	 are	 no	 longer	 active	 participants	 within	 the ATAF	project	the	project	is	still	classified,”	he	stated	bluntly.	“As	before,	none	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 are	 to	 discuss	 your	 involvement	 or	 knowledge	 of	 the	 starfighter;	 it	 doesn't exist.	Your	personal	records	and	other	assignment	papers	will	state	that	you	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	 transferred	 from	 Wolf	 359	 where	 you	 were	 working	 to	 ensure	 continued</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>security	of	Naval	interests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	is	all,  <i class="calibre4">White	Knights</i>,	you	are	dismissed.	You	will	be	informed	when</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	transport	arrives.	Until	then,	please	remain	in	your	assigned	waiting	room; </p>
<p class="calibre1">security	 will	 see	 you	 out.	 If	 there	 is	 anything	 you	 need	 before	 your	 departure, then	please	inform	a	member	of	personnel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 same	 tone	 of	 finality	 was	 still	 present	 as	 Parks	 finished	 and	 Dodds</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 not	 help	 but	 feel	 as	 if	 the	 commodore	 was	 blaming	 them	 for	 something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	some	reluctance,	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	saluted	and	turned	to	leave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Man,	I	can't	believe	they're	sending	us	to	Spirit,”	Enrique	grumbled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	must	be	some	sort	of	mistake,”	Kelly	said.	“They	surely	won't	keep	us</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	for	more	than	a	few	weeks...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	 there	 a	 problem,	 Mr	 Koonan?”	 Parks'	 voice	 came	 from	 some	 way</p>
<p class="calibre1">behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	looked	around	to	discover	that,	whilst	the	others	had	walked	towards</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 door,	 where	 a	 couple	 of	 members	 of	 security	 were	 waiting	 to	 escort	 them away,	Chaz	had	remained	rooted	to	the	spot.	He	was	staring	down	at	Parks	and, </p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	concerned	look	on	Ainsworth's	face,	he	was	not	in	the	best	of	moods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mansun,	too,	had	taken	a	small	step	backwards	in	retreat,	away	from	the	big	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">who	seemed	to	be	radiating	fury. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique	 started	 back,	 but	 Kelly	 grabbed	 his	 arm,	 holding	 him	 with	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">others.	 From	 what	 Dodds	 had	 gathered,	 whilst	 Enrique	 maintained	 a	 better</p>
<p class="calibre1">relationship	with	Chaz	than	anyone	else,	it	was	doubtful	that	he	would	be	able	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">handle	the	man	in	his	current	state.	The	two	security	guards	exchanged	a	quick</p>
<p class="calibre1">look	with	one	another,	and	their	hands	poised	over	the	pistols	at	their	belts,	ready</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	move	in	in	case	of	trouble.	Parks	remained	sat	at	his	desk,	twiddling	a	pen	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand	 and	 staring	 unflinching	 back	 up	 into	 Chaz's	 enraged	 expression,	 his	 own quite	still	and	impassive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,  <i class="calibre4">sir</i>,”	Chaz	said	after	a	time,	in	a	cold,	bitter	tone,	the	hands	at	his	sides balled	into	tight	fists. </p>

<p class="calibre1">At	 the	 edge	 of	 Imperial	 space,	 Natalia	 Grace	 had	 dragged	 a	 barely	 conscious, dying	 man	 down	 the	 corridors	 of	 her	 stricken	 vessel	 for	 what	 seemed	 like	 an eternity,	doing	her	best	to	avoid	the	flames	that	continued	to	erupt	all	around	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Twice,	 she	 had	 been	 forced	 to	 change	 her	 route	 to	 reach	 the	 escape	 pods.	 The smoke	was	starting	to	thicken	now,	making	it	difficult	to	see	and	breathe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To	make	matters	worse,	the	man	she	struggled	to	bring	with	her	had	fought</p>
<p class="calibre1">against	her	throughout	the	journey,	attempting	to	shake	her	off.	He	had	shouted</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 her	 to	 leave	 him,	 but	 she	 had	 insisted	 on	 bringing	 him	 with	 her.	 The	 man's clothes	were	bloodied,	ripped	and	burnt	in	several	places,	the	flesh	beneath	raw</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	charred.	Natalia	did	not	know	the	man's	name	and	he	had	been	unable	to	tell</p>
<p class="calibre1">her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	she	had	made	it	to	the	escape	pods.	The	ship	that	burned	around	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	not	a	large	vessel	and	there	were	only	a	handful	of	pods	to	serve	the	crew. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a>Here,	there	were	just	two.	Both	of	them	remained,	none	of	the	other	crew	-	if	any were	 still	 alive	 -	 having	 made	 it	 this	 far.	 Natalia	 had	 encountered	 numerous bodies	 along	 the	 way	 and	 it	 appeared	 that	 she	 and	 the	 man	 she	 had	 fought	 to bring	with	her	were	the	last	two	people	remaining	alive	on	the	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	vessel	gave	a	sudden,	violent	lurch,	knocking	Natalia	off	her	feet.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">struggled	to	stand	as	it	continued	to	vibrate	and	shudder. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">What	the	hell	was	that? </i>	she	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“...	 sh...	 ship's	 coming	 apart...”	 the	 voice	 of	 her	 unknown	 companion</p>
<p class="calibre1">answered	her	thoughts,	still	lying	on	the	floor	where	he	had	been	deposited.	Now</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	he	appeared	to	be	at	least	semi-conscious	and	talkative,	Natalia	hauled	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	 a	 bulkhead	 and,	 with	 some	 effort,	 managed	 to	 help	 him	 up	 into	 a	 sitting position.	His	breathing	was	heavy	and	rattling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“...	you've	gotta	get	into...	one	of...	those	quickly,”	he	told	her,	gasping	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">staring	 at	 the	 escape	 pods.	 Natalia	 tried	 to	 help	 him	 stand,	 but	 he	 cried	 out	 in pain,	pushing	her	away	as	best	he	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please,	you	have	to	get	up!”	she	begged	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“...	i	can't,”	he	whined	back	to	her.	“i	can	hardly...	even	breathe.”	He	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	her	eyes.	“You	have	to	go!	Now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	can't	go	on	my	own!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“...	if	you	don't	leave	soon...	this	ship	will	come	apart...	and	you'll	be	sucked</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	into	space...	unless	they	decide	to	finish	it	off	before	then...	you	know	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">will...	you,	more	than	anyone...	should	know	that...	this...	this	ship	is	useless...	to them	now...	they'll	come	for	you	when	they're	done	with	the	others.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Natalia	 knew	 he	 was	 right.	 The	 only	 reason	 their	 attackers	 had	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1">destroyed	the	ship	already	was	because	they	were	tackling	those	who	were	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">putting	up	a	fight,	and	her	own	vessel	was	dead	in	the	water.	But	as	soon	as	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">became	 aware	 that	 it	 was	 no	 longer	 usable,	 and	 not-at-all	 salvageable,	 they</p>
<p class="calibre1">wouldn't	hesitate	to	blow	it	to	pieces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can't	go	on	my	own,”	Natalia	repeated,	tears	streaming	down	her	face.	“I</p>
<p class="calibre1">wouldn't	 know	 where	 to	 go	 or	 what	 to	 do.	 I've	 never	 flown	 a	 ship,	 let	 alone attempted	to	navigate	in	jump	space.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through	the	flickering	light,	she	could	see	a	smile	spread	across	the	man's</p>
<p class="calibre1">face.	 “...	 didn't...	 think	 you	 wanted	 me	 for	 my	 wit	 or	 good	 looks,”	 he	 said, attempting	not	to	cough	blood	over	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Natalia	smiled	back,	though	hers	was	filled	with	sadness.	She	knelt	close	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	and	took	his	head	in	her	hands,	kissing	him	on	the	forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“...	in	my	top	pocket	is...	my	id	card...	please	make	sure	it	gets	to	my	wife.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	will,	I	promise.”	Natalia	took	the	id	card	from	him	-	it	revealed	his	name</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 be	 David	 S.	 Porter	 -	 and	 slipped	 it	 into	 a	 zipped	 inner	 pocket	 of	 her	 jacket. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>She	recalled	the	man	now:	he	was	always	telling	jokes	to	lift	the	spirits	of	all	of those	around	him.	He'd	made	her	smile	on	a	number	of	occasions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 double-checked	 to	 ensure	 that	 all	 her	 other	 important	 data	 cards	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">safe	and	secure	and	still	with	her,	before	opening	the	door	to	one	of	the	escape</p>
<p class="calibre1">pods	 and	 stepping	 across	 the	 threshold.	 After	 everything	 that	 she	 had	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">through,	 she	 could	 not	 afford	 to	 get	 away	 only	 to	 leave	 all	 the	 reports	 behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 could	 not	 remember	 all	 of	 what	 she	 had	 seen	 and	 done,	 and	 many	 others' </p>
<p class="calibre1">hard	work	had	been	entrusted	to	her.	She	could	not	let	them	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	 the	 rear	 doors,	 she	 could	 see	 straight	 through	 the	 pod	 to	 the	 cockpit windows	 at	 the	 front,	 the	 launch	 chutes	 of	 the	 main	 vessel	 open,	 revealing	 the vast	 emptiness	 of	 space	 beyond.	 It	 was	 then	 that	 she	 noticed	 the	 ship	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">spinning.	 Every	 now	 and	 again,	 scenes	 of	 the	 on-going	 battle	 would	 enter	 into her	view,	burnt-out	debris	from	other	craft	tumbling	by	in	the	immediate	outside</p>
<p class="calibre1">space. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“...	can	you	still	see...	the	jumpgate?”	she	heard	Porter	ask	behind	her,	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice	weak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	yes	I	can,”	Natalia	replied.	“But	it	looks	like	we're	moving	away	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	entry	point.	I'm	sure	we	were	closer	to	it	than	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“...	 it's	 not	 getting...	 further	 away...	 it's...	 getting	 smaller	 because	 it's closing...	soon	it	will	be	unusable...	you'll...	have	to	hurry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Natalia	hesitated.	The	thought	of	piloting	a	spacecraft,	no	matter	what	type, </p>
<p class="calibre1">made	her	sick	to	her	stomach;	like	attempting	to	cross	a	vast	ocean,	on	a	small</p>
<p class="calibre1">raft	using	nothing	but	her	own	arms	for	paddles.	Looking	around	the	pod	an	idea</p>
<p class="calibre1">struck	her	and	she	scampered	back	to	Porter's	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“...	i	can't	come	with	you,”	he	managed	again,	as	she	tried	to	help	him	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">once	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	put	you	in	one	of	the	stasis	capsules!”	she	enthused.	“You'll	be	fine</p>
<p class="calibre1">once	 you're	 under.	 And	 once	 we	 get	 to	 the	 other	 end,	 we	 can	 get	 you	 some medical	assistance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Porter	 shook	 his	 head.	 “...	 those	 ones	 aren't...	 military-grade...	 they	 don't work	like	that...	they	just	make	you	fall	asleep...	i'll	die	in	there...	and	then	you'll have	to	put	up	with	a	rotting	corpse...	until	you	get	picked	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Natalia	looked	in	anguish	from	her	dying	companion	to	the	open	pod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“...	 the	 controls	 are	 clearly	 marked,”	 he	 assured	 her.	 “...	 the	 pods	 are</p>
<p class="calibre1">designed	 to	 be	 simple	 to	 use...	 smart	 girl	 like	 you...	 should	 have	 no	 trouble working	it	out...”	he	coughed	uncontrollably	and	there	was	more	blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 ship	 rocked	 again,	 the	 shaking	 accompanied	 by	 a	 terrible	 grinding</p>
<p class="calibre1">sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go!”	Porter	mustered	enough	strength	to	put	emphasis	on	the	word. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>Natalia	rushed	back	into	the	tiny,	cramped	pod,	past	the	stasis	capsules	that lay	 like	 small	 beds	 opposite	 one	 another,	 and	 up	 to	 the	 front.	 She	 studied	 the control	 panel	 in	 the	 cockpit	 and	 discovered	 it	 was	 indeed	 very	 basic	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">straightforward.	There	was	even	a	brass	plate	with	engraved	launch	instructions</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 main	 console.	 As	 Natalia	 looked	 out	 for	 the	 jump	 point	 a	 thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">occurred	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	 can	 I	 reach	 the	 jump	 point	 with	 the	 ship	 spinning?”	 she	 asked, </p>
<p class="calibre1">returning	 yet	 again	 to	 the	 pod's	 rear	 doors.	 David	 did	 not	 answer	 her;	 he	 was dead.	The	man's	eyes	were	closed	and	he	was	slumped	forward,	quite	still. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Natalia	felt	her	heart	rate	increase,	her	breath	coming	quick.	She	was	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wasting	 no	 further	 time	 she	 hurried	 to	 the	 front	 of	 the	 pod	 and	 began	 working through	the	instructions	on	the	plate	one	by	one,	pressing	buttons	and	activating</p>
<p class="calibre1">systems	in	the	specified	order.	Behind	her	the	rear	doors	closed	and	locked.	As</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 continued	 various	 instruments	 sprang	 into	 life,	 screens	 and	 monitors	 lit	 up and	 started	 to	 tail	 system	 logs,	 statuses	 of	 essential	 parts	 and	 other	 texts.	 The final	instructions	on	the	engraved	plate	read, </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Press	'Release'	to	release	locking	clasps</p>
<p class="calibre1">Press	'Launch'	to	fire	engines</p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Looking	 down	 the	 launch	 chute	 Natalia	 realised	 what	 she	 had	 to	 do	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">pressed	the	release	 button	whilst	studying	 the	spinning	scene	 outside.	The	now</p>
<p class="calibre1">tiny	 jump	 point	 was	 coming	 into	 her	 view	 from	 bottom	 to	 top.	 The	 vessel	 was not	 spinning	 very	 fast,	 but	 her	 inexperience	 with	 starships	 had	 hit	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">confidence.	 She	 swore	 as	 she	 missed	 the	 second	 spin...	 and	 the	 third.	 On	 the fourth	 pass	 of	 the	 jump	 point,	 when	 it	 was	 more	 or	 less	 central	 in	 her	 view, Natalia	pressed	the	launch	button.	She	felt	the	engines	engage	and	the	pod	shot</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward.	The	jump	point	was	now	smaller	than	ever	and	she	prayed	that	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	she	reached	it,	it	would	not	have	closed	completely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking	behind	her	to	the	tiny	rear	door	window,	she	caught	a	glimpse	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	remained	of	the	ship	she	had	been	travelling	on.	Compulsion	overtook	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	she	moved	over	to	the	small	viewport. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	David	had	said,	her	old	ship	was	coming	apart,	small	pieces	breaking	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	 the	 time,	 severing	 the	 links	 between	 the	 larger	 sections.	 Around	 the	 vessel, Natalia	 could	 make	 out	 Imperial	 starfighters	 weaving	 between	 other	 stricken</p>
<p class="calibre1">craft,	explosions	ripping	across	their	hulls. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>Her	ships,	her	allies,	her	friends.	She	would	never	see	them	again.	The	tears came	 afresh	 and	 through	 her	 blurred	 vision	 she	 caught	 sight	 of	 an	 Imperial</p>
<p class="calibre1">frigate	reigning	over	the	carnage.	As	she	watched,	she	saw	a	starfighter	deviate</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	its	current	course	and	move	towards	her	pod.	Her	tears	of	sorrow	became</p>
<p class="calibre1">ones	 of	 fear	 and	 she	 gave	 a	 loud	 gasp.	 The	 starfighter	 approached	 and	 Natalia found	she	was	unable	to	tear	her	eyes	away	from	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	 green	 bolts	 of	 plasma	 issued	 from	 beneath	 its	 wings.	 Her	 pod	 was</p>

<p class="calibre1">“I	think	the	 <i class="calibre4">Red	Devils</i>	must	have	cheated.	You	saw	the	way	Andrea	was	sucking</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	 during	 that	 presentation.	 She	 was	 probably	 doing	 stuff	 like	 that	 the	 whole way	 through	 the	 evaluation,”	 Estelle	 continued	 to	 chew	 on	 the	 bone	 of	 the</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	 others	 said	 nothing,	 having	 since	 taken	 to	 just	 ignoring	 her.	 Enrique</p>

<p class="calibre1">the	time	to	write	in	her	journal;	and	Dodds	was	back	to	his	favourite	activity	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">staring	 out	 the	 window.	 The	 view	 was	 quite	 uninspiring,	 with	 nothing	 to	 see aside	from	jump	space's	blue	haze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle's	 misery	 was	 further	 compounded	 by	 the	 fact	 that	 the	 transport	 the</p>

<p class="calibre1">arriving	 at	 Spirit.	 It	 could	 comfortably	 hold	 twelve	 passengers,	 and	 was	 often used	 by	 high-ranking	 officials	 and	 members	 of	 senior	 command.	 With	 no-one</p>
<p class="calibre1">having	acknowledged	her,	Estelle	slipped	back	into	her	own	thoughts	and	went</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	 over	 everything	 that	 they	 had	 done	 in	 the	 past	 few	 weeks	 at	 the	 research facility. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	could	not	think	where	they	had	gone	wrong:	her	team	had	been	up	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">scratch	on	the	TAF	simulators;	even	Dodds,	following	his	lengthy	absence	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	cockpit,	had	performed	well.	There	was	no	weak	link	anywhere	as	far	as	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 determine.	 The	 ATAF	 evaluations	 in	 the	 simulators	 themselves	 had	 gone</p>
<p class="calibre1">without	 a	 hitch.	 The	 team	 had	 not	 lost	 a	 single	 member	 during	 any	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">missions	they	had	flown,	an	act	that	would	have	without	doubt	been	a	reason	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">instant	 failure.	 They	 had	 not	 conceded	 very	 many	 allied	 casualties	 during	 the assessments	 -	 in	 some	 cases,	 none	 at	 all;	 neither	 had	 they	 wasted	 very	 much ammunition.	All	she	could	think	about	was	that	they	had	not	completed	the	tasks</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>fast	 enough.

<p class="calibre1">through	her	fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	welcome	to	the	rest	of	our	military	lives,”	Enrique	said,	shuffling	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	seat,	his	arms	folded	across	his	chest,	his	eyes	closed.	Estelle	half	scowled	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	back	of	his	chair.	The	man	was	just	pretending	to	be	asleep,	so	as	to	avoid</p>
<p class="calibre1">making	conversation	with	her.	It	seemed	that,	although	he	too	was	disappointed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	had	been	quick	to	accept	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	had	spent	the	time	before	the	transport	picked	them	up	talking	things</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	 with	 Estelle	 and	 trying	 to	 reassure	 her	 that,	 like	 Parks	 said,	 it	 was	 not	 a reflection	on	her;	although	his	efforts	had	done	little	to	persuade	her	either	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	 had	 characteristically	 said	 nothing	 to	 the	 others	 following	 their	 meeting with	Parks	and	had	instead	buried	his	head	back	in	his	book.	No-one	had	since</p>

<p class="calibre1">“This	 is	 your	 captain	 speaking.	 We	 are	 now	 leaving	 jump	 space,”	 came	 a</p>

<p class="calibre1">passengers,	regardless	of	their	rank	or	status. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	their	impending	arrival	at	their	destination,	Estelle	leaned	over	to	take</p>

<p class="calibre1">orbital	ring	that	wrapped	its	way	around	the	planet	was	far	from	complete,	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">sections	 missing	 here	 and	 there.	 Construction	 equipment	 drifted	 close	 by, </p>
<p class="calibre1">looking	as	worn	out	and	neglected	as	the	ring	itself.	It	appeared	that	work	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ring	 had	 been	 put	 on	 the	 back	 burner.	 As	 the	 planet	 slid	 from	 his	 view,	 the captain	 changing	 heading	 to	 bring	 the	 shuttle	 in	 line	 with	 their	 destination, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>Dodds	 could	 not	 help	 but	 feel	 that	 it	 was	 a	 fitting	 preview	 of	 things	 to	 come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 the	 initial	 excitement	 and	 great	 anticipation	 of	 his	 call	 back	 to	 duty,	 was this	really	what	he	had	returned	to?	Maybe	his	father	had	been	right	all	along. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 well	 as	 the	 ring,	 Dodds	 could	 make	 out	 the	 wheel-like	 form	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">orbital	station	hanging	high	above	the	planet.	It	was	the	first	station	of	its	type</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	Dodds	had	ever	seen,	Xalan's	own	orbital	station	being	more	saucer-shaped</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 rounded	 tops	 and	 bottoms	 like	 most	 others.	 The	 design	 of	 Spirit's	 station looked	 as	 though	 it	 had	 wormed	 its	 way	 out	 of	 the	 reject	 pile.	 Either	 that	 or	 it was	just	cheap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly,	 seated	 in	 front	 of	 him,	 turned	 around	 with	 an	 ominous	 look	 on	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">face,	her	first	impressions	of	their	destination	leaving	much	to	be	desired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Disengagement	 complete,”	 the	 transport's	 captain	 said	 as	 cheery	 as	 ever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome	 to	 the	 Temper	 system.	 We	 will	 be	 entering	 Spirit's	 orbit	 within	 the next	twenty	minutes,	before	landing	at	Spirit	Orbital	Station	and	completing	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">flight.	I	trust	you	will	have	a	pleasant	stay.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">C</b>ommodore	 Parks'	 transport	 shuttle	 touched	 down	 on	 its	 appointed	 cliff-side landing	pad,	and	the	man	made	his	way	along	a	connecting	jetty	that	led	towards</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	number	of	tall	buildings,	set	up	against	a	small	mountain	range.	The	buildings</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	he	walked	towards	were	home	to	a	number	of	research	centres	and	offices, </p>
<p class="calibre1">one	of	which	had	been	designated	to	Admiral	Turner	for	the	duration	of	his	stay</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	Xalan.	Though	the	admiral	had	been	present	on	Xalan	during	the	three	week</p>
<p class="calibre1">ATAF	 evaluation	 program,	 he	 had,	 for	 various	 reasons,	 remained	 far	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Obex	Research	Centre,	upon	a	different	continent	entirely;	the	ground	that	Parks</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	trod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	being	home	to	the	Confederation's	main	research	and	development</p>
<p class="calibre1">facilities,	 Xalan	 was	 also	 populated	 by	 a	 number	 of	 thriving	 cities.	 Civilian immigration	and	migration	was	rigidly	controlled.	On	a	planet	such	as	Xalan,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Confederation	 were	 careful	 not	 to	 allow	 free	 movement	 and	 risk	 losing	 value</p>
<p class="calibre1">research	and	findings	to	enemy,	or	even	allied,	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike	Spirit,	Xalan	had	no	orbital	ring,	a	standard	orbital	station	sufficing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	so,	the	planet	was	one	of	the	most	fortified	throughout	the	Confederacy,	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">huge	 array	 of	 long-range	 planetary	 defence	 platforms	 circling	 a	 vast	 distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many	of	the	platforms	were	automated	and	would	open	fire	on	any	unidentified</p>
<p class="calibre1">object	that	came	into	range,	after	issuing	only	a	single	warning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turner's	office	was	high	up,	affording	him	a	stunning	panorama	of	the	city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	early	evening	when	Parks	arrived	and	the	many	lights	from	buildings	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">low	flying	vehicles	could	be	seen	twinkling	in	the	fading	light.	Occasional	patrol</p>
<p class="calibre1">craft	passed	by	his	office	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	 evening,	 Commodore,”	 Turner	 said	 as	 Parks	 was	 shown	 in	 by	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">admiral's	security. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	evening,	Admiral,”	Parks	responded,	saluting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	leave	us,”	Turner	looked	to	the	security	personnel	who	stood	either</p>
<p class="calibre1">side	of	the	door	inside	his	office.	The	pair	saluted	and	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>“Don't	 concern	 yourself	 with	 any	 standards	 of	 correctness,	 Commodore,	 I don't	 expect	 this	 to	 be	 a	 formal	 meeting,”	 Turner	 said	 once	 the	 door	 had	 shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let	 me	 apologise	 for	 having	 you	 run	 around	 so	 much	 these	 past	 few	 days.	 I appreciate	 that	 the	 constant	 back	 and	 forth	 can	 be	 stressful	 and	 I	 myself	 find space	 travel	 so	 much	 more	 convenient.	 No	 need	 to	 worry	 about	 things	 like</p>
<p class="calibre1">atmospherics.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	quite	all	right,	sir,”	Parks	said.	“Whatever	was	needed	to	get	the	job</p>
<p class="calibre1">done.”	 Parks	 had	 indeed	 been	 travelling	 a	 lot	 recently.	 Whilst	 in	 the	 Indigo system	he	had	divided	his	duties	between	Xalan's	many	research	centres	and	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">orbital	station,	spending	a	fair	amount	of	time	being	transported	between	all	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">them.	The	constant	travel	had	begun	to	take	its	toll,	but	he	was	coping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Spectacular,	isn't	it?”	Turner	changed	the	subject,	nodding	to	the	view	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	was	about	to	say	so	myself,”	Parks	agreed,	looking	out	at	the	bright	lights</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	city	in	the	distance.	“How	do	they	manage	to	get	any	work	done	here	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	view	like	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	 part	 of	 the	 reason	 we	 move	 most	 of	 them	 underground!”	 Turner</p>
<p class="calibre1">chuckled.	“Drink?”	The	admiral	walked	over	to	a	cabinet	and	removed	two	spirit</p>
<p class="calibre1">glasses.	He	picked	up	a	near	full	decanter	of	whiskey	and	gave	it	a	gentle	shake, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with	a	smile.	“Imperial	White	Label.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	 did	 you	 get	 that?”	 Parks	 asked,	 knowing	 that	 the	 contents	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">vessel	 the	 admiral	 held	 were	 not	 only	 very	 expensive,	 but	 also	 difficult	 to	 get hold	of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	admiral	smiled,	pouring	out	a	modest	amount	of	the	amber	liquid	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">each	glass.	“It	was	confiscated	from	one	of	the	local	residents	returning	home.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw	it	on	the	seizures	list	and	decided	to	help	myself.	One	signature	and	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">mine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	raised	an	eyebrow	at	just	how	blasé	the	admiral	was	acting.	Never	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	career	had	he	seen	the	man	behave	in	such	a	manner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anything	else?”	Parks	asked	as	Turner	dropped	a	couple	of	ice	cubes	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">each	glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	Turner	waved	a	hand	dismissively.	“A	man	of	my	authority	shouldn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">abuse	 his	 position.	 So,	 knowing	 that,	 I	 just	 took	 the	 other	 two	 bottles.”	 The admiral	smirked	and	handed	one	of	the	glasses	to	Parks.	He	then	returned	to	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">desk,	 sinking	 down	 into	 the	 comfortable	 black	 leather	 chair	 with	 a	 contented sigh.	 He	 then	 raised	 his	 glass.	 “Congratulations	 on	 a	 job	 well	 done, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Commodore,”	he	said,	before	knocking	back	some	of	the	liquor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	sir.”	Parks	took	a	small	sip	of	the	whiskey,	never	too	sure	if	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	ever	acquire	a	taste	for	it.	The	Imperials	tended	to	like	their	drink	strong, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>vodka	being	high	on	their	list	of	exports.	The	spirit	was	drunk	in	vast	quantities by	 asteroid	 and	 mineral	 miners	 all	 over	 the	 galaxy,	 the	 most	 popular	 being	 a brand	 known	 as	 Velda;	 coincidently	 made	 by	 the	 same	 company	 that	 produced</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	White	Label	whiskey.	Parks	had	tried	some	on	occasion	and	found	it	to	be,	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 own	 words,	 “lethal”.	 At	 close	 to	 one	 hundred	 and	 fifty	 proof	 it	 was	 not	 a drink	 to	 be	 taken	 lightly.	 It	 was	 also	 quite	 flammable	 and,	 as	 a	 consequence, banned	in	many	bars	throughout	the	Confederacy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks	 like	 we	 got	 our	 men	 then.	 Or,	 in	 this	 case,	 women,”	 Turner	 said</p>
<p class="calibre1">cheerily.	He	rocked	the	whiskey	glass	in	his	hand,	staring	at	the	liquid	within	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">watching	the	way	it	washed	over	and	around	the	ice	cubes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	said	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don't	agree?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With	 all	 due	 respect,	 sir,	 I	 feel	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	 would	 have	 been	 a	 better choice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don't	take	it	personally,	Elliott,	this	isn't	a	competition,”	Turner	said	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">small	 air	 of	 impatience.	 “You	 have	 to	 remember	 that	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 day	 we may	in	fact	be	doing	them	a	 <i class="calibre4">favour</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	was	very	little	in	it,”	Parks	objected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	the	 <i class="calibre4">test	scores</i>,	yes.	But	I	have	doubts	about	their	psychological	profiles, Commodore	 and	  <i class="calibre4">that</i>	 is	 what	 will	 count.	 We	 only	 have	 nine	 months	 or	 so	 to convince	 those	 five	 women	 of	 the	 truly	 monumental	 task	 that	 we	 will	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">expecting	 them	 to	 undertake.	 For	 now,	 we	 may	 as	 well	 take	 the	 opportunity	 to celebrate	 one	 thing	 going	 right	 over	 the	 last	 six	 months.	 God	 knows	 we	 could use	 it	 with	 the	 prospect	 of	 never	 seeing	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	 again.	 I'd	 sooner	 have	 that battleship	 completely	 destroyed	 than	 in	 the	 hands	 of	 the	 Enemy.”	 The	 last	 part became	something	of	an	irritated	mumble.	He	took	another	drink	from	his	glass, </p>
<p class="calibre1">leaned	back	in	his	chair	and	looked	up	at	the	ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks,	tired	of	standing,	sat	down	in	a	chair	adjacent	to	the	admiral's	desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	recalled	going	over	the	results	of	the	ATAF	evaluation	test	scores	and	seeing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	minimal	differences	between	the	 <i class="calibre4">Red	Devils</i>	and	 <i class="calibre4">White	Knights</i>.	 There	 were various	 aspects	 of	 the	 evaluation	 where	 the	 two	 teams	 had	 out-performed	 one</p>
<p class="calibre1">another,	leading	to	a	very	difficult	decision.	In	the	end,	however,	the	 <i class="calibre4">Red	Devils</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 just	 edged	 out	 the	  <i class="calibre4">White	 Knights</i>,	 leaving	 Parks	 with	 the	 painful	 task	 of reassigning	 the	 team	 to	 the	 border.	 The	  <i class="calibre4">Silver	 Panthers</i>	 had	 performed	 to	 a	 far lesser	degree	when	compared	to	the	others	and	Parks	had	returned	them	to	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">previous	duties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	happens	if	the	 <i class="calibre4">Devils</i>	refuse	to	go	through	with	it?”	Parks	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	why	we	need	to	be	absolutely	sure	that	they	won't,	Elliott,”	Turner</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	in	a	gruff	voice.	“We	cannot	afford	to	have	them	pull	another	Patrick	Dean</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>on	us.	That	little	incident	set	us	back	well	over	a	month.”	He	paused,	staring	into space,	then	said,	“remind	me:	what	was	the	official	line	on	that	incident?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	all	members	of	the	 <i class="calibre4">Yellow	Dogs</i>	were	killed	during	covert	operations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 were	 no	 bodies	 to	 recover	 because	 they	 were	 all	 vaporised	 in	 starfighter explosions,”	Parks	recited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	not	a	story	we	can	spin	out	for	another	five	pilots	if	they	also	decide</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	run,”	Turner	said.	“I	don't	like	the	idea	of	keeping	secrets	from	our	own	men, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	if	it	means	the	difference	between	keeping	the	facts	away	from	the	general</p>
<p class="calibre1">public	and	chaos	on	a	quite	literally	galactic	scale,	then	so	be	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	if	the	 <i class="calibre4">Devils</i>	do	try	to	run?”	Parks	wanted	to	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	we	will	have	to	find	another	way,”	Turner	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 both	 Turner	 and	 Parks	 knew	 that	 there	 was	 no	 real	 other	 way	 and	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tone	of	Turner's	voice	had	already	acknowledged	that	fact.	In	order	for	the	ATAF</p>
<p class="calibre1">project	to	successfully	run	its	course	from	here	on	out,	there	could	be	very	little</p>
<p class="calibre1">room	 for	 deviation	 or	 stalling,	 meaning	 that	 both	 men	 would	 have	 to	 be	 dead certain	of	their	every	decision.	But	neither	of	them	wanted	to	talk	about	it	now, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	himself	figuring	there	would	be	plenty	of	time	in	the	coming	months.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">decided	to	change	the	subject. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	received	word	that	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	arrived	at	Spirit	early	this	afternoon,	local time.	 They	 will	 begin	 routine	 patrols	 and	 counter	 piracy	 measures	 within	 the next	 few	 days.”	 He	 decided	 not	 to	 bother	 Turner	 with	 the	 details	 of	 the	 little incident	with	Chaz	at	the	time	he	had	informed	the	group	of	their	new	duty.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	sure	that	it	would	not	have	surprised	the	admiral	in	the	slightest.	It	could	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">put	into	a	report	for	his	perusal	at	a	later	date. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Under	Aiden	and	Anthony?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	Captain	Meyers,	but	the	commodore	will	also	be	around	as	needed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turner	nodded.	“They	will	be	in	good	hands	with	Aiden.	He's	a	good	man, </p>
<p class="calibre1">if	a	bit	soft.	He	seems	to	prefer	the	carrot	to	the	stick	nine	times	out	of	ten,	which</p>
<p class="calibre1">may	be	the	reason	he's	passed	over	for	promotion	so	often.”	Turner	drained	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">glass.	 “And	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Red	 Devils</i>?”	 He	 poured	 himself	 another	 small	 measure	 of whiskey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 declined	 the	 offer	 of	 a	 top	 up,	 but	 noticed	 that	 Turner	 eyed	 him</p>
<p class="calibre1">closely,	 as	 if	 suggesting	 the	 drink	 were	 needed.	 “The	  <i class="calibre4">Red	 Devils</i>	 will	 begin hands-on	 ATAF	 training	 operations	 in	 the	 pre-arranged	 location	 against	 some</p>
<p class="calibre1">holographic	 units.	 After	 that,	 they	 will	 participate	 in	 simulated	 combat	 training against	real	pilots.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	 so	 long	 as	 they	 don't	 kill	 anyone,”	 Turner	 remarked.	 “I	 don't	 expect</p>
<p class="calibre1">those	 other	 pilots	 quite	 know	 what	 they're	 in	 for,	 facing	 off	 against	 those fighters.	They're	in	for	one	hell	of	a	shock.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>Turner	 drank	 again	 from	 his	 glass	 and	 Parks	 looked	 down	 into	 what remained	of	his	own	whiskey.	He	had	decided	that	he	really	was	not	very	fond	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	and	in	future	he	would	only	drink	it	out	of	good	grace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turner	cleared	his	throat	and	set	his	glass	down	on	the	table.	“Now,	Elliott, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 have	 to	 confess	 I	 didn't	 just	 ask	 you	 here	 to	 share	 a	 celebratory	 glass	 of whiskey.	You	may	be	aware	that	I	have	been	in	the	service	of	the	CSN	for	most</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	my	life,	something	the	suits	in	Office	have	come	to	realise,	too.	So,	it	is	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	regret	that	I	have	to	inform	you	that	in	just	over	six	weeks'	time	I	will	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">retiring	from	service.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">What? </i>”	Parks	almost	dropped	his	glass	in	shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	know	you	believed	that	I	was	going	to	be	around	until	the	very	end,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	hasn't	been	the	case	for	quite	sometime.	Sorry	for	the	deception.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 was	 stunned.	 Everything	 now	 seemed	 quite	 urgent	 and	 the	 situation</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	found	himself	in	threatened	to	overwhelm	him.	He	pulled	back	his	sleeve	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">look	at	his	watch.	He	had	lost	all	sense	of	time	and	was	wishing	that	six	weeks</p>
<p class="calibre1">meant	six	months. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But...	 sir,	 that's	 impossible...	 it's...	 surely	 it's	 a	 mistake?”	 Parks	 spluttered as	he	fought	to	control	the	mild	terror	that	was	rising	within	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over	the	past	few	years	Parks	and	Turner	had	worked	very	close	together	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">ensure	that	the	ATAF	project	would	run	smoothly.	In	the	grand	scheme	of	things</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 hadn't	 even	 completed	 the	 first	 phase	 of	 the	 project,	 the	 most	 important aspects	 were	 yet	 to	 come.	 Parks	 now	 felt	 it	 all	 to	 be	 for	 naught	 as	 the	 admiral passed	all	future	responsibility	on	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Out	 of	 the	 window	 before	 him,	 Parks	 found	 that	 the	 darkening	 skies,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">layers	 and	 layers	 of	 thick	 grey	 clouds,	 seemed	 very	 poignant	 at	 that	 precise moment	 in	 time.	 The	 man	 felt	 as	 though	 he	 had	 been	 left	 holding	 the	 baby, leaving	him	without	any	means	of	support	or	food,	and	bleak	future	prospects. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	 sorry,	 Elliott,	 and	 I	 wish	 there	 was	 more	 that	 I	 could	 do,	 but</p>
<p class="calibre1">unfortunately	 my	 retirement	 has	 been	 forced	 upon	 me,”	 the	 old	 admiral	 said	 in regretful	 tones.	 “I	 have	 already	 deferred	 it	 by	 more	 than	 two	 years,	 so	 I	 am unable	to	play	that	card.”	He	rose	from	his	chair	and	paced	slowly	back	and	forth</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 front	 of	 the	 window,	 looking	 again	 out	 at	 the	 beautiful	 cityscape.	 “The	 suits want	me	out.	They're	afraid	that	a	man	of	my	age	will	start	to	make	mistakes	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	then	jeopardise	the	project.	Ha!	I	may	be	old,	but	I'm	not	senile	just	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whiskey?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	became	aware	of	the	admiral	hovering	over	him.	He	had	disappeared</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	 his	 own	 thoughts	 as	 he	 had	 attempted	 to	 digest	 the	 news	 that	 had	 hit	 him like	 a	 sledgehammer.	 He	 only	 nodded,	 seeing	 the	 whiskey	 as	 a	 buffer	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediate	comforter.	Turner	topped	up	his	glass. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>“What's	going	to	happen?”	Parks	asked	after	taking	a	good	drink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You're	 going	 to	 finish	 what	 we	 started,	 Commodore.	 You're	 not	 going	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">give	 up	 or	 wind	 things	 down	 a	 notch	 just	 because	 I'm	 no	 longer	 able	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">participate	in	the	project.	What	would	you	do	if,	for	example,	I	were	killed	while</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	transit?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 point	 was	 well	 made.	 Parks	 reflected	 that	 people	 often	 forgot	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">responsibility	was	often	passed	to	them	without	fair	warning.	He	would	be	able</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	make	use	of	Turner's	knowledge	for	the	next	six	weeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	still	have	until	the	end	of	June,	Elliott,”	Turner	added.	“There	is	plenty</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	time	to	ensure	the	transition.	You	know	most	of	it	anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	studied	Turner	as	he	spoke	and	for	the	first	time	he	became	aware	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	admiral	looked	old	and	tired.	His	eyes	betrayed	a	sense	of	weariness	unusual</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 such	 a	 strong	 minded	 man.	 But	 with	 the	 revelation	 of	 his	 impending</p>
<p class="calibre1">retirement	 his	 other	 features,	 the	 greyed	 and	 thinned	 hair,	 his	 thin	 face	 and wrinkles,	no	longer	said	“experienced”. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everything	 is	 changing,	 Elliott,”	 Turner	 said,	 a	 touch	 sadly.	 “We're</p>
<p class="calibre1">becoming	more	and	more	like	a	federation	every	day.	Current	events	are	forcing</p>
<p class="calibre1">us	all	to	work	much	closer	together	than	ever	before	and	the	government	is	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">getting	 stronger	 for	 it.	 We're	 more	 tightly	 coupled	 now	 than	 at	 any	 time	 in	 the last	century.”	He	was	sitting	once	more	in	his	chair	and	was	leaning	back,	staring</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	 at	 the	 ceiling	 again.	 Parks	 studied	 him	 as	 he	 did	 so,	 trying	 to	 see	 into	 his mind,	 to	 hear	 what	 the	 man	 might	 be	 thinking.	 “And	 whether	 the	 independent</p>
<p class="calibre1">nations	 like	 it	 or	 not,	 with	 the	 gradual	 unifications	 of	 their	 governments	 and military	 forces	 they're	 making	 steps	 towards	 becoming	 a	 confederate	 state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether	 or	 not	 any	 of	 these	 things	 are	 good,	 only	 time	 will	 tell.	 Whatever happens,	the	galaxy	will	be	a	very	different	place	in	the	next	five	or	six	years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	men	sat	in	silence	for	a	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	 you	 have	 any	 plans?	 For	 your	 retirement,	 I	 mean?”	 Parks	 asked.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 not	 very	 good	 at	 small	 talk,	 but	 felt	 that	 it	 could	 only	 serve	 to	 calm	 them both. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually,	yes!”	Turner	sat	forward	and	smiled,	now	quite	jubilant.	“I'll	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">returning	 to	 Earth	 to	 see	 my	 new	 granddaughter.	 You	 may	 remember	 that	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">daughter	 was	 supposedly	 barren?	 As	 it	 happens	 she	 gave	 birth	 to	 a	 naturally conceived	healthy	young	girl	a	few	days	ago,	and	I	plan	on	being	there	with	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">family.”	He	took	another	drink;	he	was	close	to	finishing	his	second	glass.	“To</p>
<p class="calibre1">tell	the	truth	I'll	be	grateful	to	spend	as	much	time	with	them	as	possible.	Should</p>
<p class="calibre1">none	of	this	work	out	in	the	end	then	I	will	prefer	to	have	spent	the	time	left	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">my	 family,	 rather	 than	 in	 some	 stellar	 graveyard.	 I	 hope	 you	 do	 not	 think	 that cowardly	of	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a>“No,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.	 Despite	 our	 duties	 some	 of	 us	 did	 find	 time	 to	 start	 a	 family,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turner	muttered,	looking	into	the	bottom	of	his	glass	as	he	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some	of	us	just	don't	seem	to	be	able	to	get	started,”	Parks	muttered	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 all	 his	 time	 in	 the	 Navy,	 Parks	 had	 never	 found	 time	 for	 romance	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1">relationships	 and	 he	 knew	 Turner	 could	 tell	 that	 he	 had	 all	 but	 given	 up,	 more important	things	now	driving	him	onwards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Strength	to	carry	on,	Commodore.	We're	only	human	after	all.”	Turner	set</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 glass	 down	 on	 the	 desk,	 having	 drained	 it.	 “Admiral	 Jenkins	 will	 be	 taking over	my	duties	following	my	departure.	She	is	already	aware	of	my	situation	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	status	of	the	project.	I	suggest	that	before	the	end	of	the	month	the	three	of	us</p>
<p class="calibre1">take	some	time	to	get	together	and	become	more	familiar	with	each	other's	core</p>
<p class="calibre1">responsibilities	 and	 assignments.	 That	 should	 help	 to	 ensure	 that	 there	 are	 no shocks	 in	 store	 come	 the	 beginning	 of	 July.	 Until	 that	 time	 I	 will	 continue	 to retain	full	command	over	the	CSN.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	nodded	an	acknowledgement,	taking	another	sip	of	whiskey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	I	expect	you	have	a	lot	to	think	about	and	do,	so	I	will	not	take	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	more	of	your	time,”	Turner	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	rose	and	saluted,	taking	the	hint.	“Thank	you	for	the	drink,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Funny	 how	 a	 bit	 of	 bad	 news	 can	 take	 away	 the	 taste	 of	 bad	 whiskey,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turner	chuckled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 was	 under	 the	 impression	 that	 he	 had	 hidden	 his	 revulsion	 well.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">made	a	mental	note	never	to	play	poker	against	the	admiral. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turner,	too,	stood	and	saluted.	“Safe	journey.	I	have	the	utmost	faith	in	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	see	this	through,	Elliott.	Remember	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Returning	to	his	transport,	Parks	paused	to	take	in	the	view	once	more.	The	high</p>
<p class="calibre1">landing	 jetty	 provided	 a	 view	 of	 almost	 equal	 beauty	 to	 that	 of	 Turner's	 office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 he	 stood	 for	 a	 while	 at	 the	 cliff	 edge,	 feeling	 the	 cool	 breeze	 of	 the evening	wind	upon	his	hands	and	face,	looking	out	at	the	cityscape	and	the	light</p>
<p class="calibre1">reflecting	off	twin	moons,	shimmering	across	the	gentle	waves	of	the	calm	ocean</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 had	 seen	 more	 stunning	 sights	 during	 his	 lifetime,	 but	 tonight,	 at	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">particular	 moment,	 this	 was	 at	 the	 same	 time	 the	 most	 beautiful	 and	 most</p>
<p class="calibre1">frightening	 sight	 he	 had	 ever	 seen:	 for	 it	 was	 a	 testament	 to	 the	 power	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a>human	 spirit,	 from	 their	 humble	 beginnings	 on	 Earth	 to	 a	 spacefaring	 race, spanning	dozens	of	star	systems	across	the	galaxy;	and	with	that	a	stark	reminder</p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">After	 many	 hours	 in	 flight,	 the	 Knights'	 transport	 at	 last	 docked	 with	 Spirit Orbital	and	the	ever-chipper	voice	of	the	transport's	captain	informed	the	pilots</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	it	was	safe	for	them	to	disembark.	There	were	grumbles	from	Estelle	as	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">stepped	 out	 onto	 the	 flight	 deck,	 the	 initial	 impressions	 of	 the	 station	 itself	 no less	than	what	any	of	them	had	expected.	From	the	moment	he	stepped	out	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">transport	 Dodds	 at	 once	 noticed	 that	 the	 station	 presented	 an	 air	 of	 being	 run down,	neglected	and	somehow	trapped	in	the	past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">White	 Knights</i>?”	 a	 deck	 attendant	 enquired.	 Estelle	 begrudgingly</p>
<p class="calibre1">confirmed	their	identity.	“Follow	me.	There	is	a	shuttle	waiting	to	take	you	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	surface.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 started	 after	 the	 man	 with	 the	 others,	 catching	 the	 sound	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">chuckling	 as	 he	 did	 so.	 He	 looked	 around	 to	 see	 a	 group	 of	 service	 men	 and women,	engineers	and	various	other	deckhands	watched	as	he	traipsed	by,	heads</p>
<p class="calibre1">turning	 and	 grinning	 to	 one	 another.	 Dodds	 figured	 that	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	 were	 far from	the	first	to	feel	somewhat	repulsed	by	their	new	surroundings,	and	it	must</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 been	 a	 great	 source	 of	 amusement	 for	 the	 current	 residents	 to	 see	 the reactions	each	time	a	new	set	of	faces	turned	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reaching	 the	 shuttle,	 Dodds	 slung	 his	 meagre	 bag	 of	 possessions	 inside</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	 slumping	 down	 onto	 one	 of	 the	 steel	 benches	 that	 ran	 the	 length	 of	 the cramped	 interior.	 Though	 he	 tried	 to	 remain	 upbeat,	 something	 about	 his	 new</p>
<p class="calibre1">surroundings	was	already	attempting	to	break	his	spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Touching	 down	 on	 the	 planet's	 surface,	 Dodds	 needed	 no	 further	 confirmation</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 their	 special	 treatment	 was	 well	 and	 truly	 over.	 Arriving	 at	 their	 mixed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>quarters,	 he	 and	 Enrique	 were	 dismayed	 to	 find	 they	 were	 crammed	 in	 with fifteen	 others.	 Their	 appearance	 at	 the	 doorway	 was	 greeted	 by	 cheers	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">whistles	from	their	new	bunk	mates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey!	It's	the	new	guys!”	came	a	cry	from	across	the	quarters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We've	got	ourselves	a	full	house,	boys!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome	to	Action	Central!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	you!	Think	fast!”	A	ball	was	thrown	towards	Dodds.	He	fumbled	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">catch,	letting	it	roll	out	of	his	hands	and	bounce	around	on	the	floor	for	a	time, </p>
<p class="calibre1">before	its	path	was	halted	by	the	clutter	it	encountered	there.	It	looked	as	though</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	base	-	or	at	least	these	quarters	-	was	not	big	on	discipline,	with	clothes	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">personal	 belongs	 scattered	 all	 about.	 It	 looked	 like	 a	 holiday	 camp	 for	 rowdy teenagers.	Kelly	poked	her	head	between	Enrique	and	Dodds,	who	had	halted	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	doorway.	Estelle	squeezed	past	all	three	and	scanned	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“oh	 dear	 god,”	 Kelly	 said	 in	 a	 low	 voice.	 “I	 really	 wish	 I	 was	 back	 at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Gabriel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh	huh,”	Enrique	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	sleep	next	to	me,”	Kelly	said	to	Enrique.	Dodds	noted	that	the	men</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 dormitory	 were	 already	 eyeing	 up	 the	 two	 women,	 and	 were	 being</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything	but	subtle	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wouldn't	want	it	any	other	way,”	Enrique	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	was	in	agreement.	After	three	weeks	of	his	own	personal	space,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">five	months	back	home	before	that,	this	new	regime	was	going	to	take	a	lot	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">getting	used	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	coped	a	lot	better,	striding	in,	finding	a	spare	bed	and	claiming	it	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	own,	tossing	the	random	items	that	occupied	it	onto	another	nearby	bed.	In</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 hours	 that	 followed	 it	 did	 not	 take	 her	 long	 to	 discover	 that	 she	 was	 the highest	 ranking	 officer	 in	 the	 dormitory	 (something	 that	 genuinely	 astonished</p>
<p class="calibre1">her)	and	as	a	consequence	one	of	the	least	popular. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 another	 time,	 in	 another	 place,	 Dodds	 would	 have	 advised	 her	 against</p>
<p class="calibre1">flexing	 her	 muscles	 in	 the	 very	 first	 instance,	 but	 right	 now	 he	 was	 not	 in	 the mood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	 found	 himself	 a	 bunk,	 acting	 as	 always	 with	 his	 trademark	 silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 his	 locker	 filled	 with	 clothes,	 boots	 and	 other	 personnel	 effects	 the	 man kicked	back,	pulled	out	his	book	and	disappeared	into	the	pages. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>“Welcome	 to	 Mandelah	 Naval	 Base,	 boy	 and	 girls;	 and	 welcome	 to	 Spirit.	 I'm Captain	 Meyers	 and	 while	 here	 you	 will	 be	 acting	 under	 my	 command,”	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">portly,	ginger	bearded	man	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	  <i class="calibre4">White	 Knights</i>	 were	 seated	 within	 a	 small	 briefing	 room,	 alongside other	 new	 arrivals	 to	 the	 Temper	 system,	 some	 of	 whom	 shared	 their	 new</p>
<p class="calibre1">quarters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 group	 had	 been	 given	 a	 brief	 tour	 of	 the	 base	 and	 found	 that,	 even</p>
<p class="calibre1">though	Spirit	had	an	orbital	station,	the	overpopulation	of	available	pilots	meant</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	many	of	them	had	to	be	based	on	the	ground.	It	also	meant	that	in	order	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">perform	 their	 duties,	 they	 would	 have	 to	 be	 transferred	 back	 up	 to	 the	 orbital station	on	an	almost	daily	basis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 would	 not	 have	 been	 the	 case	 if	 construction	 on	 the	 orbital	 ring	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 completed,	 allowing	 for	 crew,	 service	 personnel	 and	 starfighters	 to	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">housed	within,	Estelle	grumbled	during	the	tour.	As	it	stood,	not	even	the	craft</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 they	 would	 be	 required	 to	 pilot	 were	 stationed	 planet-side.	 Standard</p>
<p class="calibre1">Confederation	 starfighters	 were	 not	 capable	 of	 withstanding	 the	 stresses	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">atmospheres	would	put	upon	them	whilst	attempting	planetary	leave	or	re-entry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	this,	Estelle	had	also	reminded	them,	slipping	into	a	sulk,	was	not	something</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 the	 ATAF	 suffered	 from.	 Dodds	 caught	 Chaz's	 eye	 and	 swore	 later	 he	 saw him	crack	a	smile.	For	his	moody	exterior	he	was	starting	to	find	some	mirth	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle's	continued	moaning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 suppressed	 a	 small	 sigh,	 folded	 his	 arms	 and	 tried	 to	 appear</p>
<p class="calibre1">interested	in	what	Meyers	was	saying.	The	captain	was	giving	them	an	overview</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	what	would	be	expected	of	them	whilst	they	were	stationed	at	Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 Temper	 system	 is	 the	 principle	 route,	 and	 therefore	 the	 closest</p>
<p class="calibre1">Confederation	border	world,	to	Independent	World	space,”	Meyers	went	on.	“In</p>
<p class="calibre1">general	 terms	 this	 means	 that	 all	 sane	 traffic	 wishing	 to	 safely	 enter	 or	 leave Confederation-controlled	space	must	do	so	via	this	system.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why?”	 a	 female	 voice	 behind	 Dodds	 asked.	 He	 didn't	 bother	 to	 look</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	to	see	who	was	asking	the	question.	“I	mean,	we	can	easily	travel	all	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	from	Earth	to	Kethlan	in	a	single	jump	if	we	wanted	to.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	any	longer,	no,”	Meyers	said.	“Owing	to	recent	developments	within</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Mitikas	Imperium,	the	Confederation	is	no	longer	permitting	jumpgates,	save</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 those	 along	 the	 border,	 to	 allow	 incoming	 or	 outgoing	 traffic	 to	 non-</p>
<p class="calibre1">Confederate	destinations.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	everyone	is	having	to	come	through	here	instead?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For	the	foreseeable	future,	yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 the	 volume	 of	 traffic	 must	 be	 incredible!”	 the	 voice	 sounded	 quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken	aback. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a>“It	 is,	 yes,	 but	 it's	 a	 necessary	 precaution	 that	 the	 government	 wishes	 to take.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	had	the	image	of	an	egg	timer	in	his	head,	the	grains	of	sand	being</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	starships	that	were	waiting	-	with	strained	tempers	-	to	pass	through	the	gates</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	move	on	to	their	destination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	 what	 about	 everyone	 else?	 If	 they	 have	 their	 own	 jump	 drives	 they</p>
<p class="calibre1">don't	 need	 to	 use	 the	 gates.	 Somewhere	 between	 ten	 and	 fifteen	 percent	 of	 all spacecraft	can	form	their	own	jump	points.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	met	Enrique's	eyes	and	raised	an	eyebrow	at	the	comment	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">well	versed	informant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meyers	put	up	his	hand	and	waved	the	woman	down.	“We'll	get	on	to	how</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	are	tackling	that	in	a	little	bit.	For	now,	all	of	the	Confederacy's	navigation</p>
<p class="calibre1">buoys	 are	 refusing	 to	 supply	 data	 on	 routes	 towards	 non-Confederate	 systems</p>
<p class="calibre1">and,	in	particular,	the	Mitikas	Empire.	Without	that	data,	space	is	once	again	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 sea	 was	 to	 early	 sailors	 on	 Earth:	 a	 treacherous	 place	 with	 little	 to	 no landmarks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Until	they	learned	to	use	the	stars	to	navigate,”	another	voice	chipped	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“True,”	 Meyers	 began	 to	 chuckle.	 “But	 you'd	 have	 a	 hell	 of	 a	 time	 doing</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	up	there.”	He	nodded	towards	the	ceiling.	“Now...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse	 me,	 Captain,	 but	 what	 are	 the	 government	 taking	 precautions</p>
<p class="calibre1">against?”	yet	another	voice	piped	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mass	immigration,”	Meyers	said	simply.	“The	increased	instability	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Imperial	systems	has	led	to	a	greater	amount	of	traffic	coming	into	Temper,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	there	into	further	sectors	of	Confederation	space.	Most	of	these	are	traders</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempting	to	find	new	avenues	of	business	now	that	their	old	ones	have	closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfortunately,	 organised	 crime	 is	 also	 suffering	 the	 same	 loss	 and	 you	 can	 bet that	they	will	also	come	flooding	in	with	them.	Now...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 found	 that	 Meyers	 was	 proving	 to	 be	 incredibly	 patient,	 given	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">continued	 interruptions.	 He'd	 heard	 that	 the	 man	 was	 like	 that	 though:	 very</p>
<p class="calibre1">pleasant	 and	 accommodating;	 and	 that	 was	 also	 why	 he	 was	 still	 a	 captain	 and not	a	commodore.	Heads	turned	around,	following	Meyers'	eyes.	Dodds	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	this	time,	seeing	an	olive-skinned	man	with	a	puzzled	expression	holding</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	hand	in	the	air.	For	a	moment	Dodds	thought	he	recognised	him	as	one	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">five	 men	 from	 the	 lecture	 theatre	 all	 those	 weeks	 ago,	 but	 realised	 he	 was mistaken.	Meyers	scratched	at	his	beard	as	the	man	spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	 sorry,	 Captain,	 but	 this	 sounds	 like	 a	 job	 for	 the	 local	 police,	 not	 the Navy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>“True,	but	the	police	forces	throughout	Temper	have	come	under	increased stress	 whilst	 attempting	 to	 handle	 this	 issue	 and	 have	 requested	 our	 assistance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	should	be	aware	that	it	could	also	soon	no	longer	be	a	matter	for	the	police; </p>
<p class="calibre1">remember	that	this	is	also	a	game	of	politics:	whilst	relationships	are	now	good</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 previously	 troublesome	 Independent	 World	 systems,	 a	 show	 of	 strength	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	bad	thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sounds	 like	 they're	 turning	 us	 into	 the	 flood	 barriers,”	 Dodds	 heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique	whisper	to	Kelly.	He	noticed	Kelly	appear	to	snap	awake,	as	if	she	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 daydreaming.	 He	 could	 relate:	 he	 was	 drifting	 in	 and	 out	 of	 the	 room</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself,	trying	to	think	of	a	way	he	could	escape	to	somewhere	more	interesting</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	not	involving	apples. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	 we're	 going	 to	 be	 making	 pre-emptive	 strikes	 against	 known	 pirate</p>
<p class="calibre1">bases	 and	 insurgent	 strongholds?”	 the	 questioner	 asked,	 his	 face	 brightening	 at the	prospect	for	some	action.	At	the	man's	words	the	assembled	pilots	all	became</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	 more	 awake	 and	 alert.	 Dodds	 imagined	 that	 they,	 like	 him,	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">visualising	 scenarios	 in	 which	 they	 were	 performing	 important	 and	 heroic</p>
<p class="calibre1">services	 to	 the	 Confederation,	 none	 of	 which	 went	 unnoticed,	 and	 all	 of	 which resulted	 in	 a	 great	 deal	 of	 action,	 grand	 recognition,	 and	 well-deserved</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Not	at	this	point,	no,”	Meyers	said,	almost	as	if	he	was	apologising.	“For</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Oh	dear	God,	please	just	kill	me	now,”	Enrique	said	under	his	breath	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">slid	down	in	his	seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Make	 that	 a	 double,”	 Dodds	 requested,	 his	 own	 dreams	 of	 valour</p>
<p class="calibre1">vanishing	before	his	eyes.	It	was	as	if	some	twenty	four	hours	previous	he	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 quaffing	 the	 highest	 quality	 Dom	 Pérignon,	 but	 was	 now	 being	 force-fed</p>
<p class="calibre1">cheap	plonk.	Estelle,	seated	in	front	of	the	pair,	turned	around	and	shot	them	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">angry	glare	that	said,	“Sit	Up,	Shut	up	and	Put	Up”.	Enrique	and	Dodds	pulled</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves	both	upright	and	attempted	to	stay	focused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meyers,	with	the	aid	of	a	map	of	the	Temper	system,	went	on	to	list	patrol</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">When	 I	 first	 arrived	 here	 it	 was	 like	 my	 first	 day	 in	 the	 service	 all	 over</i> <i class="calibre4">again.

As	a	matter	of	fact	there	is	quite	a	lot	to	do	here	and	I've	taken</i> <i class="calibre4">up	 running	 and	 some	 other	 activities	 with	 Enrique	 and	 Dodds.

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">We	get	most	of	our	evenings	free	here,	though	not	the	weekends	any	more. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The	 schedule	 of	 the	 patrols	 means	 that	 our	 days	 off	 vary,	 but	 we	 usually	 don't</i> <i class="calibre4">have	to	do	more	than	five	days	on	the	trot.	We	don't	have	to	patrol	at	night	either</i> <i class="calibre4">because	those	stationed	on	the	orbital	handle	that,	although	some	of	our	patrols</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">do	end	rather	late	and	then	we	might	have	an	early	one	the	next	morning.	Today</i></p>

<p class="calibre1">“Kelly?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 word	 drifted	 through	 Kelly	 Taylor's	 head	 as	 she	 continued	 to	 work, </p>
<p class="calibre1">failing	to	registering.	It	being	her	day	off	she	had	spent	most	of	the	day	writing, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 stylus	 strokes	 of	 her	 normal	 handwriting	 being	 transformed	 into	 characters on	the	screen.	Just	now	something	had	broken	her	concentration	and	she	struck</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	the	word	she	had	written	to	erase	it,	trying	to	regain	her	train	of	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kelly?	 Hey!”	 an	 impatient	 voice	 called	 out,	 making	 the	 young	 woman</p>
<p class="calibre1">jump.	Kelly	looked	up	from	where	she	sat,	cross	legged	on	her	bed,	to	see	that</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>Estelle	had	been	demanding	her	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,	 Estelle,	 what	 did	 you	 say?”	 Kelly	 asked.	 She	 then	 noticed	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	was	wearing	her	flight	suit	and	felt	a	small	twinge	of	panic	in	the	pit	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	stomach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	said	hurry	the	hell	up	because	you're	going	to	make	us	late	for	our	patrol! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our	transport	is	waiting	to	go!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I...	I	thought	we	had	the	day	off?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 that's	 tomorrow!	 They	 changed	 the	 schedule	 this	 morning!	 Come	 on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly,	you've	only	got	a	couple	of	minutes	to	suit	up!	We've	got	to	get	to	landing</p>
<p class="calibre1">zone	G	and	that's	not	exactly	next	door!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly	swore	as	she	jumped	off	her	bed	and	hurriedly	began	packing	up	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">belongings.	She	cursed	herself	for	being	so	busy	that	day	reviewing	her	journal, </p>
<p class="calibre1">correcting	 spelling	 and	 reading	 through	 past	 entries	 that	 she	 had	 neglected	 to check	the	patrol	schedule.	She	tugged	open	her	locker,	pulling	out	her	flight	suit</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	boots,	tearing	off	her	clothes	and	throwing	them	to	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	struggled	to	get	into	her	flight	suit	as	fast	as	possible,	managing	to	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	leg	in	and	then	starting	on	the	next.	The	flight	suits	were	skin	tight	and	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	slip	on	very	easily;	it	was	like	trying	to	put	on	a	wetsuit... </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop	 bloody	 staring,	 you	 perv!”	 Estelle's	 voice	 came.	 Kelly	 followed</p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle's	icy	glare	to	a	man	who	had	been	reclining	on	his	bed	opposite,	reading	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">book.	 He	 had	 since	 lowered	 it	 to	 take	 a	 look	 at	 Kelly	 as	 she	 stood	 in	 her underwear,	 but	 with	 Estelle	 glaring	 at	 him,	 he	 was	 once	 again	 returning	 to	 his reading	 material.	 Kelly	 saw	 Estelle	 turn	 back	 to	 her	 once	 more,	 her	 eyes	 still narrowed,	 and	 quickly	 turned	 away	 to	 concentrate	 on	 getting	 ready.	 She	 didn't want	 to	 hear	 any	 accusations	 roll	 off	 Estelle's	 tongue	 right	 now,	 she	 was	 more than	capable	of	imagining	what	they	might	be,	having	heard	them	on	occasions</p>
<p class="calibre1">before:	 wondering	 how	 Kelly	 could	 be	 such	 a	 good	 pilot	 and	 yet	 so	 absent</p>
<p class="calibre1">minded	 at	 other	 times,	 spending	 too	 much	 time	 scribbling	 in	 her	 journal	 when there	were	more	important	things	-	such	as	this	-	that	she	needed	to	pay	attention</p>
<p class="calibre1">to,	and	questioning	why	she	kept	a	journal	at	all;	no	good	would	ever	come	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	the	constant	writing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thankfully,	Kelly	was	just	about	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	the	rest	on	the	way,”	Estelle	suggested	whilst	Kelly's	fingers	attended</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	various	clips	on	her	boots.	Her	boots	more	or	less	fastened,	Kelly	picked</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	 her	 personal	 belonging	 and	 threw	 them	 in	 her	 locker	 before	 securing	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although	 she	 got	 on	 well	 with	 the	 others	 in	 their	 shared	 quarters,	 she	 did	 not know	 any	 of	 them	 well	 enough	 yet	 to	 trust	 them.	 She	 had	 also	 written	 little comments	about	each	of	them	in	her	journal	that	she	thought	they'd	be	better	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	seeing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>“Okay,	ready.”	Kelly	said,	turning	back	to	Estelle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kelly,	where's	your	helmet?”	Estelle	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly	looked	at	the	floor,	then	her	bed	and	realised	that	she'd	left	it	inside</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	locker.	She	yanked	it	out	and	then	secured	the	locker	once	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Ready</i>?”	Estelle	asked	once	Kelly	finally	appeared	to	be	done.	She	did	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">wait	for	an	answer	before	indicating	that	they	had	wasted	enough	time	already. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	are	the	others?”	Kelly	asked,	as	the	pair	hastened	down	the	various</p>
<p class="calibre1">well	 lit	 corridors,	 dodging	 other	 inhabitants	 of	 the	 base	 as	 they	 sort	 to	 ensure they	made	it	to	the	transport	in	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They're	there	already.	I	came	back	to	find	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	don't	make	a	habit	of	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	stepped	out	of	the	barracks,	into	the	open	air,	where	they	stepped	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	pace	in	order	to	reach	the	assigned	pick-up	point.	The	shuttle	craft	awaited</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 arrival,	 but	 Kelly	 could	 see	 the	 air	 around	 the	 engines	 shimmering, </p>
<p class="calibre1">indicating	 that	 it	 was	 prepared	 to	 set	 off	 the	 moment	 the	 two	 women	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">aboard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	air	marshal	stood	by	the	side	door	watched	their	approach.	“de	Winter? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taylor?”	he	asked	the	pair	as	they	arrived	at	the	transport. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	nodded,	somewhat	out	of	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.	Get	inside.	We	almost	had	to	go	without	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	door	shut	and	bolted	behind	them	and	they	sat	down	on	one	of	the	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">steel	benches	running	either	side	of	the	length	of	the	craft. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,”	 Kelly	 said	 to	 the	 rest	 of	 her	 team,	 once	 she	 managed	 to	 get	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">breath	back.	The	shuttle	was	full	today,	all	thirty	places	taken	up.	Kelly	reached</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	and	pulled	the	restraining	harness	down	around	her.	The	transport	was	far	less</p>
<p class="calibre1">glamorous	 than	 the	 one	 they	 had	 used	 when	 they	 had	 been	 ferried	 to	 and	 from Xalan,	being	a	lot	more	cramped	and	uncomfortable	with	no	view	of	the	outside</p>
<p class="calibre1">world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Journal?”	 Enrique,	 whom	 she	 had	 sat	 next	 to,	 whispered	 in	 her	 ear.	 She</p>
<p class="calibre1">gave	a	sheepish	nod	in	reply.	It	wasn't	the	first	time	-	and	unlikely	to	be	the	last	-</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	her	hobby	had	almost	landed	her	in	serious	trouble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Prepare	 for	 takeoff,”	 the	 transport's	 pilot	 called	 back	 at	 them.	 The	 craft</p>
<p class="calibre1">shuddered	 as	 the	 engines	 engaged	 and	 Kelly	 felt	 them	 leave	 the	 ground.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">shuddering	 increased	 as	 the	 transport	 lifted	 them	 into	 orbit.	 She	 always	 hated this	part.	Even	after	several	weeks	of	having	to	endure	it,	it	still	did	not	get	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">better.	 Around	 her	 others	 had	 a	 tight	 hold	 of	 their	 restraining	 bars,	 some	 with their	eyes	closed.	She	joined	in.	The	journey	to	the	orbital	station	was	not	long, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	a	short	time	later	the	restraining	bars	were	disengaged. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Today	you	will	be	patrolling	route	Delta	D-15,”	the	Officer	of	the	Deck	said	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 handed	 Estelle	 an	 electronic	 map	 of	 the	 route	 around	 the	 Temper	 system. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	should	ensure	that	you	hit	all	four	check	points	at	least	once	an	hour.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	stole	a	glance	over	Estelle's	shoulder	at	the	route	map	to	see	if	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 anything	 interesting	 on	 their	 patrol	 that	 day;	 even	 a	 minute	 piece	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">information	that	might	make	the	next	four	hours	a	bit	more	bearable.	There	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing.	For	Dodds	the	patrols	were	now	becoming	a	chore;	a	regular	job	that	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">dreaded	 going	 to	 each	 morning	 and	 which	 did	 nothing	 except	 take	 up	 his	 free time.	He	desperately	wanted	something	to	happen	to	break	the	monotony	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">hours	he	spent	in	the	cockpit.	He	had	twice	had	to	endure	just	over	six	hours	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 seat,	 doing	 nothing	 but	 watching	 a	 jumpgate	 and	 its	 uninteresting	 traffic flow,	 with	 little	 more	 than	 an	 hour's	 break.	 It	 was	 just	 as	 he	 had	 feared	 after Meyers'	 briefing	 all	 those	 weeks	 ago	 and	 he	 had	 been	 mentally	 and	 physically exhausted	after	both	of	those.	It	was	like	being	tortured	to	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	flight	deck	of	the	orbital	station	was	never	silent.	Starfighters	were	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever	being	returned	to	their	bays	or	taxiing	to	the	catapult,	preparing	for	launch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Engineers	 and	 technicians	 were	 working	 to	 repair	 wear	 and	 tear,	 as	 well	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">performing	general	maintenance.	Munitions	handlers	were	moving	heavy-laden</p>
<p class="calibre1">trolleys	around	the	deck,	so	that	they	could	be	loaded	onto	fighters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	number	of	different	craft	occupied	the	bays	here,	the	TAF	being	the	most</p>
<p class="calibre1">common.	Next	there	was	the	two-seater	Ray.	Though	the	fighter	was	less	nimble</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	the	TAF,	it	benefited	from	greater	defensive	and	offensive	capabilities.	On</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 patrols	 Chaz	 and	 Enrique	 would	 usually	 fly	 one	 together,	 availability</p>
<p class="calibre1">allowing.	Otherwise	their	flight	group	consisted	exclusively	of	TAFs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several	Rooks	occupied	other	bays,	though	none	of	them	had	moved	in	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	weeks	that	Dodds	had	been	stationed	at	Spirit,	the	fighters'	main	purpose	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	be	the	defence	of	the	station	itself.	The	Rooks	were	almost	never	allocated	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">patrols,	the	easier	to	maintain	TAFs	and	Rays	being	given	that	duty.	Dodds	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 fond	 of	 the	 Rook	 himself,	 the	 craft	 feeling	 far	 too	 bulky	 and	 sluggish	 in flight.	 It	 felt	 even	 worse	 in	 combat,	 where	 lighter	 and	 faster	 starfighters	 could outmanoeuvre	 it.	 Even	 so	 he	 had,	 at	 one	 time,	 looked	 upon	 the	 Rook	 in	 awe; there	had	been	no	denying	it	was	a	powerful	craft.	He	now	gave	them	little	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	a	sideways	glance,	aware	that	the	crown	belonged	to	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hot	 out	 there	 today?”	 Enrique	 said,	 as	 Dodds	 and	 Estelle	 continued	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>study	the	route	map. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Been	all	quiet	so	far,	sir,”	the	officer	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 response	 did	 not	 surprise	 Dodds.  <i class="calibre4">Should	 have	 applied	 for	 that	 damn</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">transfer</i>,	 he	 thought.	 Though	 after	 Estelle	 had	 been	 denied	 her	 own	 request	 to seek	adventure	and	excitement	elsewhere	-	actually,	in	her	case,	recognition	-	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 pretty	 certain	 he	 knew	 what	 the	 answer	 to	 his	 would	 be:	 remain	 at	 Spirit until	further	notice.	He	was	just	going	to	have	to	lump	it	for	the	time	being;	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	not	about	to	return	to	Earth	with	his	tail	between	his	legs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Around	Dodds	others	were	finishing	their	patrols.	He	watched	with	envy	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	appreciative	pilots	removed	their	helmets	and	left	the	flight	deck	to	return	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	quarters	for	a	well-earned	hot	shower.	He	looked	forward	to	being	in	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">position	later	on.	At	least	today's	patrol	was	only	three	hours	long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 watched	 as	 Estelle	 clicked	 through	 the	 map	 a	 few	 times,	 scrutinizing</p>
<p class="calibre1">each	segment	before	handing	it	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everything	good?”	the	flight	officer	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">No</i>,	thought	Dodds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	we'll	see	you	back	here	at	twenty	hundred	hours,”	the	flight	officer</p>
<p class="calibre1">replied,	before	heading	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Only	if	I	don't	die	of	boredom	in	the	cockpit	first. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,	 Kelly,	 I	 want	 you	 out	 there	 first,”	 Estelle	 said.	 “Takeoff	 and	 then hold	position	outside	the	orbital	until	we	are	all	assembled.	Got	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	Lieutenant,”	Kelly	said,	shuffling	off	towards	her	waiting	TAF. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Best	to	make	sure	that	she's	actually	with	us	and	not	bumbling	about	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">place	else,”	Estelle	muttered	to	the	three	men	stood	on	the	deck	next	to	her.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">four	watched	as	Kelly's	TAF	accelerated	down	the	catapult. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who's	 acting	 wing	 commander	 for	 this	 patrol?”	 Dodds	 said,	 as	 Estelle</p>
<p class="calibre1">began	to	make	for	her	allocated	TAF. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	am,	Dodds,”	Estelle	answered	with	a	flat,	tired	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">What	 a	 surprise</i>,	 Dodds	 thought	 gloomily.	 On	 a	 patrol	 it	 was	 hardly	 a significant	duty,	but	one	that	might	help	to	lift	his	spirits	a	little.	He	thought	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 irony	 of	 the	 name	 of	 the	 planet	 he	 was	 based.  <i class="calibre4">Two	 hundred	 and	 thirty	 five</i> <i class="calibre4">minutes	to	go.	Two	hundred	and	thirty	if	I'm	</i> really <i class="calibre4">	lucky</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	attendant	signalled	to	Dodds	that	his	TAF	was	ready	and	the	young	pilot</p>
<p class="calibre1">traipsed	his	way	over	to	the	starfighter.	One	day	of	proper	action	was	all	that	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">wished	for	as	he	stepped	up	into	the	TAF's	seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 secured	 his	 helmet,	 buckled	 himself	 in	 and	 then	 gave	 a	 thumbs-up	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique	 and	 Chaz,	 standing	 down	 on	 the	 flight	 deck,	 watching	 him.	 The	 two</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>men	were	waiting	for	the	all-clear	to	board	the	Ray	they	had	been	assigned	for the	patrol.	Enrique	gave	Dodds	a	thumbs-up	in	return.	Chaz	gave	him	an	almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">invisible	nod,	Dodds	only	catching	it	because	of	knowing	what	to	expect	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 his	 TAF	 taxied	 up	 to	 the	 catapult	 Dodds	 waited	 to	 be	 granted</p>
<p class="calibre1">clearance	 to	 launch.	 Staring	 down	 the	 illuminated	 tunnel,	 to	 the	 dark	 space</p>
<p class="calibre1">outside,	 Dodds	 tried	 to	 gear	 himself	 for	 the	 next	 few	  <i class="calibre4">thrilling</i>	 hours	 ahead.	 He now	understood	why	Temper	was	often	referred	to	as	“Action	Central”. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lieutenant	Dodds,	this	is	Tower:	you're	clear	for	takeoff,”	a	woman's	voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	over	his	cockpit's	intercom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah	 thanks,	 Tower,”	 Dodds	 replied.	 “I'll	 be	 sure	 to	 let	 you	 know	 if</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything	interesting	happens;	like	we	come	across	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>,	hidden	under	a	load</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	black	tarpaulin.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Please,	 just	 remind	 me	 I'm	 alive</i>,	 he	 begged,	 as	 his	 TAF	 hurtled	 down	 the catapult	and	out	the	station.  <i class="calibre4">At	least	for	just	one	day. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“He's	 coming	 back	 around!”	 Dodds	 cried,	 as	 the	 fighter	 he	 had	 been	 tailing</p>
<p class="calibre1">barrelled	and	then	circled	around	over	his	head.	Dodds	dipped	his	TAF	out	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	before	rolling	around	to	continue	his	pursuit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	on	him,”	Kelly	called,	bringing	the	craft	into	her	sights.	She	adjusted</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 speed	 to	 hold	 it	 there	 for	 as	 long	 as	 possible,	 so	 as	 to	 give	 her	 on-board computer	 time	 to	 lock	 a	 missile.	 Her	 opponent's	 movements	 were	 all	 over	 the place,	 swerving	 this	 way	 and	 that,	 Kelly	 herself	 doing	 her	 best	 to	 counter	 its erratic	nature.	She	had	only	to	keep	the	craft	within	her	HUD	for	a	few	moments</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer	and	then	the	missile	would	be	ready	to	fire...	The	fighter	accelerated	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">suddenly,	 shaking	 her	 off	 and	 diving	 straight	 down	 towards	 Enrique	 and	 Chaz</p>
<p class="calibre1">who	were	already	tailing	another	of	the	group's	opponents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	  <i class="calibre4">White	 Knights</i>	 had	 been	 halfway	 through	 their	 patrol	 when	 they	 were alerted	 to	 a	 set	 of	 unidentified	 vessels	 travelling	 through	 their	 assigned	 route. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Speeding	into	the	vicinity	they	had	sighted	their	quarry,	the	three	craft	bunched</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	 close	 together	 and	 appearing	 to	 be	 in	 a	 hurry.	 Their	 trajectory	 put	 them	 on course	 with	 a	 jumpgate	 that	 would	 take	 them	 deeper	 into	 Confederation-controlled	 space,	 and	 the	 speed	 and	 formation	 of	 the	 craft	 suggested	 that	 they were	trying	to	pass	through	undetected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle's	 requests	 for	 identification,	 destination	 and	 business	 purpose	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>been	ignored,	the	three	fighters	maintaining	their	tight	formation,	but	increasing their	speed.	Estelle	had	challenged	them	twice	more	before	the	craft	had	turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">hostile.	 Based	 on	 their	 vessel	 of	 choice	 –	 a	 Dart,	 a	 cheap	 single	 seat,	 general purpose	craft	with	innumerable	available	variants	-	she	had	concluded	that	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">must	 be	 wanted	 criminals.	 She	 had	 gone	 on	 to	 order	 them	 to	 surrender	 several times	before	Dodds	reminded	her	that	it	did	not	seem	like	they	were	the	talkative</p>
<p class="calibre1">type. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly's	 eyes	 narrowed.	 Though	 the	 Dart	 that	 was	 once	 again	 in	 her	 sights</p>
<p class="calibre1">benefited	 from	 upgraded	 offensive	 and	 defensive	 capabilities,	 she	 maintained</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 the	 only	 real	 advantage	 the	 long-bodied	 craft	 held	 over	 her	 TAF	 was	 its speed.	Her	on-board	computer	jingled	and	she	loosed	the	missile	even	before	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">lock	 verification	 had	 time	 to	 flash	 across	 her	 HUD.	 It	 sped	 away	 from	 her, trailing	 blue	 and	 white	 particles	 as	 it	 twisted	 and	 curled	 to	 keep	 up	 with	 its target's	frantic	attempts	to	evade	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">That	 makes	 up	 for	 being	 tardy,	 I	 suppose</i>,	 Kelly	 thought	 to	 herself	 as	 the Dart	exploded	before	her	in	a	shower	of	debris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Target	down,”	she	reported. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	work,	Kelly,”	Estelle	came	back.	“One	down,	two	to	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got	one	right	behind	me,”	Dodds	said,	feeling	his	TAF	vibrate	as	particle</p>
<p class="calibre1">bolts	slammed	into	the	rear,	the	shielding	absorbing	the	hits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	 made	 a	 quick	 assessment	 of	 the	 situation	 and	 standings.	 The	 death</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 their	 comrade	 had	 had	 a	 detrimental	 effect	 on	 the	 performance	 of	 the	 two remaining	 Dart	 flyers,	 whose	 flight	 had	 become	 far	 more	 sloppy,	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">confidence	shaken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Enrique,	Chaz,	stay	on	your	target;	Kelly	you	assist	them.	Dodds,	help	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	other	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got	it,”	Dodds	confirmed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	four	Confederation	fighters	divided	as	Estelle	had	ordered	and	set	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	targets.	The	Darts	weaved	and	dived	as	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	tailed	them,	frequently coming	close	to	collisions	with	their	pursuers	as	they	made	snap	changes	to	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">headings.	 Plasma	 and	 particle	 rounds	 flew	 in	 every	 direction	 as	 the	 two	 sides attempted	to	bring	one	another	down,	none	quite	managing	to	hit	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Damn	this	crap	HUD!”	Dodds	said	as	the	Dart	evaded	another	burst	of	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">guns.	 After	 three	 weeks	 of	 benefiting	 from	 the	 ATAF's	 predictive	 targeting</p>
<p class="calibre1">capabilities	he	now	felt	crippled	without	it,	as	though	he	was	handcuffed	to	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">seat.	It	was	clear	that	the	advantages	the	starfighter	offered	had	spoilt	him	and	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	finding	it	difficult	to	readjust.	It	dawned	on	him	that	this	was	the	first	time</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	had	been	in	a	combat	situation	-	simulated	or	otherwise	-	since	the	evaluation</p>
<p class="calibre1">program	 back	 on	 Xalan.	 The	 Dart	 skimmed	 through	 his	 sights.	 He	 fired	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>missed	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	the	bloody	hell	haven't	they	loaded	the	ATAF's	combat	software	onto</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	damn	crate?”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Careful	 there,	 Dodds,”	 Enrique	 said.	 “You're	 beginning	 to	 sound	 like</p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle.”	He	took	his	eyes	off	his	systems	for	a	moment,	trying	to	guess	which	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	three	TAFs	he	could	snatch	a	glimpse	of	through	the	Ray's	canopy	might	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shut	it,	mate,	this	is	really	starting	to	annoy	me!”	Dodds	retorted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	frustration	in	the	voice	made	Enrique	start	to	chuckle.	He	looked	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	Chaz,	sat	next	to	him,	whose	face	split	into	what	Enrique	recognised	as	a	rare</p>
<p class="calibre1">smile.	It	vanished	almost	as	soon	as	it	had	appeared,	the	big	man	diverting	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Ray's	heading	as	the	missile-lock	warning	sounded.	His	attempt	at	evasion	came</p>
<p class="calibre1">too	 late	 and	 the	 Ray	 rocked	 as	 the	 missile	 slammed	 into	 the	 topside	 of	 the fighter,	both	men	feeling	the	heavy	vibration	coarse	through	their	bodies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,”	 Enrique	 said	 for	 allowing	 himself	 to	 become	 distracted,	 before</p>
<p class="calibre1">refocusing	on	the	battle.	Chaz	called	up	a	damage	report.	It	indicated	that	both</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 top	 and	 frontal	 shield	 quadrants	 had	 collapsed,	 but	 were	 recovering	 slowly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 the	 missile	 had	 detonated	 the	 force	 of	 the	 explosion	 had	 driven	 its	 way through	the	shield	and	to	the	Ray's	armour	beneath.	The	damage	incurred	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">armour	had	not	been	insignificant,	but	not	as	critical	as	it	had	felt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	two	all	right?”	Estelle	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We've	 sustained	 moderate	 damage.	 Shielding	 is	 running	 at	 sixty	 percent</p>
<p class="calibre1">efficiency,”	Chaz	reported	back.	“Nothing	we	can't	handle.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	glanced	at	her	radar,	seeing	a	red	triangle	sitting	right	in	the	middle; </p>
<p class="calibre1">almost	right	on	top	of	her.	A	moment	later	the	four	pale	grey	rear	fins	and	bright</p>
<p class="calibre1">cyan	 glow	 of	 the	 Dart's	 single	 engine	 swept	 across	 her	 cockpit	 view.	 She</p>
<p class="calibre1">immediately	gave	chase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	she	closed	in	on	the	fighter	she	saw	something	detach	itself	from	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	fins,	the	object	arcing	up	around	it.	She	swore	as	too	late	she	realised	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	happening,	her	on-board	computer	sounding	the	warning	for	only	a	couple</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	seconds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Such	was	the	range	from	its	target	that	the	missile	completed	its	manoeuvre</p>
<p class="calibre1">within	 a	 matter	 of	 seconds	 and	 slammed	 headlong	 into	 her	 TAF,	 creating	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">blinding	 white	 flash	 as	 the	 explosion	 blended	 in	 with	 the	 bright	 blue	 splinters from	 her	 collapsed	 shielding.	 The	 starfighter	 rattled	 with	 the	 impact,	 jostling Estelle	in	her	seat	and	making	the	young	woman	lunge	for	the	ejection	handle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 expected	 prompt	 to	 bail	 out	 never	 came,	 however,	 the	 rattling	 ceasing	 a short	time	later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Estelle!”	Dodds'	voice	sounded	in	her	comms. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a>“I'm	 okay,	 I'm	 okay,”	 Estelle	 replied,	 thankful	 that	 her	 voice	 had	 not betrayed	the	terror	she	had	felt	upon	seeing	what	she	believed	was	her	own	death</p>
<p class="calibre1">hurtling	straight	towards	her.	Out	of	the	corner	of	her	eye	she	saw	an	explosion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Target	 down,”	 Kelly	 once	 again	 reported.	 The	 Dart	 that	 had	 attacked</p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique	 and	 Chaz	 had	 pulled	 out	 of	 its	 dive	 and	 flown	 right	 in	 front	 of	 her, bringing	itself	dead	on	to	her	heading.	It	had	aligned	within	her	cross	hairs	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly	 had	 only	 to	 pull	 the	 trigger.	 Her	 TAF's	 cannons	 had	 fired	 four	 times,	 the first	pair	of	bolts	slamming	into	the	rear	of	the	ship,	followed	by	the	second.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">third	 pair	 completed	 the	 task	 whilst	 the	 fourth	 had	 disappeared	 into	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">explosion,	striking	remnants	of	the	destroyed	fighter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	leave	some	for	the	rest	of	us,”	Dodds	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 isn't	 a	 game,	 Dodds!”	 Estelle	 barked	 back.	 “Concentrate	 on	 taking</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	that	last	fighter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 his	 companions	 dead,	 and	 now	 even	 more	 out-numbered	 and	 out-</p>
<p class="calibre1">gunned	 than	 ever,	 the	 final	 Dart	 pilot	 swung	 around,	 put	 full	 power	 to	 their engines	and	began	to	flee	from	the	naval	pilots	as	fast	as	they	could,	resuming</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	attempt	to	reach	the	far-off	jumpgate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 four	 fighters	 gave	 chase,	 each	 attempting	 to	 bring	 down	 the	 final</p>
<p class="calibre1">fleeing	craft.	The	Dart	was	fast,	faster	than	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>,	and	it	would	soon	be	out of	range	of	their	guns;	but	not	their	missiles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle's	 targeting	 computer	 jingled.	 She	 declared	 her	 lock.	 The	 others</p>
<p class="calibre1">acknowledged	her.	The	missile	armed	and	fired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 the	 same	 instant	 her	 comms	 crackled	 into	 life.	 “I	 won't	 go	 back	 there! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Please	don't	make	me	go	back!	I	beg	you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	not	a	voice	that	she	at	first	recognised	and	as	the	small	red	triangle</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	her	radar	screen	started	to	blink,	Estelle	realised	that	it	was	coming	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fighter	she	had	just	fired	at.	“They	can't	be	stopped!	They'll	kill	me!	They'll	kill</p>
<p class="calibre1">you!	They'll	kill	all	of	us!!	Please,	just	let	me	go!	I	just	want	to	get	away	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">them!	 PLEASE!”	 the	 voice	 continued	 as	 the	 missile	 devoured	 the	 distance</p>
<p class="calibre1">between	itself	and	the	target	it	sought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	 inside	 Estelle	 made	 her	 regret	 firing.	 There	 was	 terror	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">man's	voice;	a	terror	that,	for	some	unexplained	reason,	caused	her	a	great	deal</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 discomfort.	 It	 was	 the	 kind	 of	 terror	 that	 sounded	 as	 though	 it	 had	 been ingrained	 into	 the	 man's	 very	 soul.	 She	 looked	 down	 at	 the	 TAF's	 controls, </p>
<p class="calibre1">seeking	a	way,	any	way,	to	put	a	stop	to	the	missile	that	was	seconds	away	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">destroying	 its	 target.	 She	 found	 none	 and	 looked	 back	 to	 the	 final	 floundering manoeuvres	of	the	Dart	as	the	missile	closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	 craft	 exploded,	 killing	 its	 helpless	 occupant	 and	 leaving	 Estelle	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">questions	 that	 might	 now	 never	 be	 answered.	 She	 slowed	 her	 TAF	 and	 stared</p>
<p class="calibre1">ahead	at	the	tumbling	clutter	of	alloys.	The	others	joined	her,	Dodds	and	Kelly</p>
<p class="calibre1">coming	 along	 either	 side,	 though	 not	 close	 enough	 to	 identify	 the	 faces	 within the	helmets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nice	shooting,	Estelle,”	Dodds	said,	although	his	enthusiasm	came	across</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	somewhat	subdued	and	muted,	the	rush	of	the	battle	dampened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	the	hell	was	that	all	about?”	Kelly	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I...	I	have	no	idea,”	Estelle	replied.	It	sounded	too	real	to	have	been	a	bluff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man's	 final	 words	 had	 been	 almost	 hysterical	 and	 they	 were	 still	 going</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	in	her	head, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">I	won't	go	back	there...” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Go	back	where? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">They'll	kill	me!	They'll	kill	you!	They'll	kill	us	all!” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Who	was	going	to	kill	him?	Who	were	the	people	in	the	Darts?	Why	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">those	they	were	fleeing	so	intent	on	attacking	the	Confederation	and	her	allies? </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	was	regretting	her	actions	and	now	wanted	nothing	more	than	to	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">brought	the	man	back	to	Spirit	for	questioning.	She	looked	to	her	radar	and	saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique	 and	 Chaz	 pulling	 up	 beneath	 the	 three	 of	 them.	 “How	 you	 guys	 doing down	there.	Any	further	damage?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chaz?	How	we	looking,”	Enrique	prompted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Same.	 Minor	 structural	 damage.	 Shielding	 is	 still	 at	 sixty	 percent,”	 Chaz</p>
<p class="calibre1">replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	okay,	man?”	Enrique's	voice	came	after	a	pause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,”	Chaz	answered.	“Just	need	to	make	sure	we're	good	for	the	rest	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	patrol.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	 noted	 that	 the	 man	 sounded	 somewhat	 distracted.	 She	 began	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">ponder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	now,	Estelle?”	Dodds	asked	after	a	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We...	 er...	 transfer	 a	 report	 of	 our	 findings	 and	 the	 battle	 back	 to	 Spirit Orbital,”	she	said,	watching	as	what	remained	of	the	Dart	continued	to	tumble, </p>

<p class="calibre1">She	watched	as	Dodds	pulled	away	from	her,	Kelly	following	after	him,	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">placing	her	comms	on	mute	and	putting	on	her	over	her	chest.	She	could	feel	her</p>

<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	first	real	combat	she	had	experienced	in	months,	but	it	somehow</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt	 a	 lot	 more	 real	 than	 usual.	 She	 closed	 her	 eyes	 and	 counted	 slowly	 to	 ten, distancing	herself	from	the	event. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everyone	 ready?”	 she	 asked	 once	 she	 believed	 she	 had	 given	 them</p>

<p class="calibre1">Though	there	did	not	appear	to	be	any	other	craft	in	the	area,	Estelle	ordered	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Affirmative,	 de	 Winter,	 we're	 going	 to	 send	 over	 a	 landing	 party.	 Please</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Think	anyone	is	alive	in	there?”	Dodds	asked	of	his	wingmates. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“At	least	they	put	up	a	decent	fight,”	Dodds	commented. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	good	enough	though,”	Estelle	answered,	raising	her	eyes	up	from	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">radar	 and	 looking	 at	 the	 lifeless	 ship	 they	 had	 been	 requested	 to	 assist.	 She watched	as	another	 piece	of	wreckage	 drifted	toward	her	 TAF	before	bouncing</p>

<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	doing?”	Enrique	asked	Chaz.	The	big	man	was	fiddling	with	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">underneath	one	of	the	screens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Finding	out	what's	going	on,”	he	said.	He	continued	pressing	buttons	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">tapping	 at	 the	 screen,	 the	 computer	 issuing	 an	 occasional	 bleep	 in	 response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique	 didn't	 recognise	 anything	 that	 was	 being	 displayed	 on	 the	 screen	 Chaz was	 accessing.	 The	 general	 lack	 of	 finesse	 in	 the	 layouts	 and	 aesthetics	 of	 the data	representation	suggested	that	the	man	had	accessed	something	that	was	only</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Will	do,	Captain.	We	will	maintain	an	open	channel,”	Williams	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	that?”	Enrique	said	as	he	listened	to	the	chatter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	 the	 communications	 link	 being	 used	 between	 the	 boarding	 party	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Merekat</i>,”	Chaz	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique	took	a	moment	to	understand.	“Wait,	hold	on.	Did	you	just	hack...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	began,	stunned	by	what	the	man	had	just	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shhh!	Listen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique	fell	silent	and	the	two	men	listened	in	to	the	conversation	between</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	 party	 leader,	 Williams,	 stood	 by	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Cardinal</i>'s	 airlock	 door	 turned	 to	 a member	of	his	team.	“Kate,	would	you	do	the	honours?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kate	 produced	 a	 small	 portable	 device	 and	 connected	 it	 via	 a	 number	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">cables	 to	 the	 exterior	 airlock	 control	 panel.	 The	 door	 lock	 gave	 a	 short	 buzz,	 a little	red	light	on	the	control	panel	changing	to	green. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Open,	sir,”	she	said,	stepping	to	one	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent.	Right,	remember	everyone:	no	energy	weapons,”	Williams	told</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 team.	 “We	 want	 to	 minimise	 damage	 to	 the	 interior	 if	 we	 encounter	 any</p>
<p class="calibre1">hostilities.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 team	 was	 made	 up	 of	 seven,	 clad	 in	 dark	 blue,	 lightly	 armoured	 suits</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 wearing	 protective	 helmets.	 On	 their	 feet	 they	 wore	 magnetic	 boots	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 be	 activated	 in	 low	 and	 zero	 gravity	 situations.	 Most	 of	 their	 larger weapons	 were	 also	 equipped	 with	 a	 torch,	 for	 circumstances	 where	 they	 might</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 to	 work	 in	 the	 dark.	 Aside	 from	 the	 weapons,	 the	 team	 also	 carried</p>
<p class="calibre1">maintenance	gear,	and	medical	supplies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	seven	men	and	women	stood	to	either	side	of	the	airlock,	so	as	not	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">expose	themselves	to	anyone	who	might	be	waiting	on	the	other	side.	Williams</p>
<p class="calibre1">gave	Kate	the	signal	to	open	the	airlock,	and	as	the	door	slid	open	they	were	met</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 nothing	 except	 for	 an	 empty	 corridor,	 pitch	 black	 save	 for	 where	 the	 falloff lighting	from	the	boarding	tube	illuminated	the	entrance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Archer,	Fisher,”	Williams	indicated	to	the	two	men	closest	the	entrance	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">enter	 first.	 One	 after	 the	 other	 they	 ran	 in,	 shining	 their	 torches	 around	 the immediate	area.	They	determined	that	the	corridor	was	empty,	but	even	so	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">stalked	forward	cautiously,	still	met	by	neither	opposition	nor	crew	members. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Clear,”	 Fisher	 declared.	 The	 rest	 of	 the	 team	 entered	 the	 thin	 corridor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	member	removed	a	device	from	his	belt	and	scanned	the	area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Minimal	 power	 on	 this	 deck;	 gravity	 and	 life	 support	 are	 functioning	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">usual.	There	does	appear	to	be	more	power	in	the	direction	of	the	upper	decks, </p>
<p class="calibre1">though,”	he	reported. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Williams	 nodded.	 “Pair	 up	 and	 spread	 out.	 Get	 in	 touch	 as	 soon	 you</p>
<p class="calibre1">encounter	survivors	or	hostile	forces.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 group	 paired	 off	 as	 ordered	 and	 proceeded	 to	 explore	 the	 darkened</p>
<p class="calibre1">lower	 deck	 of	 the	 ship,	 carefully	 checking	 possible	 hiding	 places	 in	 various rooms	 and	 ensuring	 they	 illuminated	 all	 unreachable	 areas	 well.	 With	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>exception	of	a	hacked	airlock	door	-	which	they	assumed	the	invaders	must	have used	 to	 get	 inside	 -	 they	 once	 again	 came	 up	 empty-handed.	 The	 team	 soon</p>
<p class="calibre1">regrouped	 by	 the	 lift	 to	 the	 upper	 deck	 and	 found	 the	 doors	 burnt	 and	 pock-marked	by	multiple	weapon	blasts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lift	 is	 operational,	 sir,”	 reported	 Kate	 and,	 at	 the	 request	 of	 Williams, </p>
<p class="calibre1">pressed	the	call	button.	The	lift	arrived	and	the	doors	parted,	greeting	the	team</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	slumped	body	of	a	dead	man.	Blood	was	splattered	over	his	clothes	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">interior	of	the	lift.	The	multiple	lights	of	the	investigators	fell	upon	a	shotgun	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	still	grasped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 is	 Williams:	 we've	 found	 a	 body.	 Judging	 by	 the	 way	 this	 guy	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">dressed,	it	isn't	one	of	the	crew,”	Williams	reported	to	the	 <i class="calibre4">Merekat</i>.	“If	the	state of	the	lift	is	anything	to	go	by,	there	has	been	one	hell	of	a	firefight	in	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What're	we	looking	at?”	the	captain	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Definitely	a	raiding	party,”	Williams	said,	edging	forward	and	examining</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	dead	man's	body.	He	pushed	aside	the	beaded	dreadlocks	that	covered	part	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 raider's	 face,	 revealing	 a	 tattoo	 of	 a	 spider's	 web	 on	 his	 left	 cheek.	 “Cheap body	 armour.	 Didn't	 do	 him	 any	 good,”	 Williams	 muttered,	 then,	 “We're</p>
<p class="calibre1">proceeding	to	the	upper	deck.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	upper	deck	of	the	ship	told	a	different	story	to	the	lower.	Bodies,	trails</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 blood	 and	 other	 clear	 signs	 of	 battle	 were	 in	 evidence	 throughout.	 Shorting electronics	lit	the	dark	corridors	with	bright	bursts	of	spark	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be	 careful	 of	 those,”	 Williams	 pointed	 out	 some	 wires	 that	 hung</p>
<p class="calibre1">inconspicuously	from	the	ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Williams	divided	the	team,	instructing	one	half	to	accompany	him	towards</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 bridge,	 and	 the	 other	 to	 spread	 out	 along	 the	 upper	 deck	 and	 continue	 to search	for	any	survivors.	They	moved	with	care,	ensuring	they	ducked	under	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">loose	wires.	The	team	encountered	yet	more	bodies	as	they	went,	none	of	whom</p>
<p class="calibre1">displayed	 any	 signs	 of	 life.	 A	 scattering	 of	 clothing	 styles	 suggested	 that	 the crew	and	their	attackers	had	taken	an	equal	number	of	casualties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 team	 discovered	 most	 of	 the	 bodies	 on	 the	 bridge,	 some	 appearing	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 died	 as	 a	 result	 of	 close	 quarters	 combat;	 the	 unfortunate	 crew	 of	 the <i class="calibre4">Cardinal</i>	 marred	 by	 stab	 wounds	 all	 over	 their	 bodies,	 some	 having	 had	 their throats	cut.	It	was	a	horrific	scene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks	 like	 the	 crew	 tried	 to	 barricade	 themselves	 inside	 the	 bridge,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Williams	reported	once	more	to	 <i class="calibre4">Merekat</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Any	sign	of	what	they	could	have	been	looking	for?”	came	the	reply	in	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">earpiece. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing	yet,	but	I'm	guessing	they	may	have	been	scavengers.	Looks	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 <i class="calibre4">Cardinal</i>	was	just	in	the	wrong	place	at	the	wrong	time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>Williams	 and	 his	 team	 pressed	 on	 into	 the	 bridge	 in	 an	 attempt	 to	 gather more	 information.	 Following	 a	 short	 inspection	 of	 the	 bridge	 area,	 Kate	 began examining	the	ship's	logs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some	 data	 has	 been	 downloaded	 from	 the	 computers,”	 she	 said,	 running</p>

<p class="calibre1">With	her	own	orders	and	duties	clear	in	her	head	she	was	not	prepared	to	allow</p>

<p class="calibre1">He	started	forward.	The	people	opened	their	eyes	as	they	became	aware	of</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	 explosives	 went	 off,	 the	 blasts	 ripping	 their	 way	 through	 the	 ship.	 A</p>

<p class="calibre1">Chaz	and	Enrique	were	amongst	the	first	to	hear	the	sound,	but	it	was	not	until</p>

<p class="calibre1">that	they	realised	what	they	had	heard	and	became	aware	of	the	crisis. </p>

<p class="calibre1">wingmates.	The	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	 swung	 their	 fighters	 around	 and	 pulled	 away	 from	 the <i class="calibre4">Cardinal</i>	as	quickly	as	they	could,	retreating	back	away	from	the	ship	they	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	called	in	to	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Merekat</i>	 was	 not	 so	 lucky.

Before	 long	 the explosion	that	Archer	had	triggered	found	its	way	to	the	 <i class="calibre4">Cardinal's</i>	 reactor	 and the	two	ships	were	torn	apart	by	the	tremendous	force	of	the	blast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	sat	motionless	for	a	moment,	watching	a	section	of	one	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ships	tumbling	before	them.	Not	long	after	Estelle	was	contacted	by	the	second</p>
<p class="calibre1">rescue	ship,	which	identified	itself	as	 <i class="calibre4">CSN	Buffalo</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Together	 the	 five	 craft	 set	 about	 searching	 for	 signs	 of	 any	 possible</p>
<p class="calibre1">survivors	 amongst	 the	 carnage,	 no	 matter	 how	 futile	 it	 seemed.	 None	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">found.

<p class="calibre1">Finally,	after	recovering	the	black	boxes	from	the	 <i class="calibre4">Cardinal</i>	and	 <i class="calibre4">Merekat</i>,  <i class="calibre4">Buffalo</i> signalled	to	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	it	was	ready	to	leave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There's	nothing	more	for	us	to	do	here,”	Estelle	informed	her	team.	“We'll</p>

<p class="calibre1">“This	 is	 an	 utter	 disaster!”	 Turner	 grated,	 holding	 his	 head	 in	 his	 hands	 as	 he read	the	reports	detailing	the	fates	of	the	 <i class="calibre4">Cardinal</i>	and	 <i class="calibre4">Merekat</i>.	Though	they	had yet	to	be	fully	sorted	and	collated,	it	had	not	proven	difficult	to	piece	together	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">picture	of	exactly	what	had	happened	earlier	that	evening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 had	 returned	 to	 Xalan	 upon	 hearing	 the	 news.	 He	 now	 stood	 before</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>Turner,	waiting	as	the	admiral	went	over	each	of	the	reports,	knowing	that	they did	not	make	for	pleasant	reading. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	 the	 hell	 was	  <i class="calibre4">Cardinal</i>	 doing	 there	 without	 some	 sort	 of	 escort?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turner	growled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“According	to	Spirit	Orbital	they	had	reported	a	suspected	case	of	Shizaru's</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fever	aboard	and	had	performed	an	emergency	jump	into	Temper.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turner	 stared	 at	 him	 incredulously.	 “Shizaru's	 Fever?	 The	 disease	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">induces	deaf-blindness?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,”	Parks	said,	though	he	found	himself	sharing	Turner's	scepticism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There's	 not	 been	 a	 confirmed	 or	 even	 reported	 case	 of	 that	 for	 over	 one</p>
<p class="calibre1">hundred	years.	They	should	have	followed	proper	procedure	instead	of	trying	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">handle	 it	 themselves,”	 Turner	 grumbled.	 “Just	 our	 damned	 luck	 that	 raiders</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 choose	 a	 research	 ship	 to	 hit.	 This	 is	 precisely	 why	 we	 need	 to	 step	 up patrols	in	all	sectors.	This	event	could	have	been	easily	avoided	if	we'd	simply</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	more	manpower.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 nodded,	 even	 though	 he	 knew	 that	 it	 wasn't	 a	 real	 solution;	 Turner</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 clutching	 at	 straws.	 The	 bigger	 issue	 was	 what	 had	 been	 taken	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Cardinal</i>.	 The	 moment	 word	 had	 reached	 him	 that	 the	 ship	 had	 been	 attacked and	destroyed,	Parks	prayed	that	was	all	that	had	happened.	As	the	reports	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	various	witnesses	had	come	in,	he	had	heard	that	a	craft	had	fled	the	scene</p>
<p class="calibre1">moments	 before	 the	 ship's	 destruction.	 But	 not	 before	 a	 dump	 had	 been	 taken from	the	computer	systems,	copied	onto	a	data	card	and	then,	presumably,	taken</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	board	the	fleeing	vessel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	mused.	As	a	mobile	research	facility	 <i class="calibre4">Cardinal</i>	had	held	much	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Confederation's	 project	 work,	 acting	 as	 an	 extreme	 kind	 of	 disaster	 recovery</p>
<p class="calibre1">service.	 It	 therefore	 held	 a	 lot	 of	 important	 data;	 though	 none	 as	 important	 as those	 pertaining	 to	 the	 ATAF	 project,	 as	 both	 he	 and	 Turner	 knew	 full	 well.	 It was	 all	 there:	 every	 schema,	 blueprint,	 theory,	 problem,	 solution,	 purpose;	 the list	went	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 <i class="calibre4">Cardinal's</i>	black	box	had	proven	to	be	a	treasure	trove	of	information, </p>
<p class="calibre1">detailing	all	the	events	leading	up	to	the	ship's	untimely	destruction.	As	well	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">letting	the	CSN	know	the	nature	of	the	data	that	had	been	downloaded	onto	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">data	card,	it	had	also	revealed	the	destination	of	the	jump	point	the	thief	had	used</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 escape.	 And	 Parks	 had	 almost	 despaired	 when	 he	 had	 discovered	 it	 led	 into Imperial	space.	Of	all	the	places	the	thief	could	have	chosen	to	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon	 hearing	 the	 news	 Turner	 had	 conversed	 with	 the	 Confederate</p>
<p class="calibre1">Administration,	who	had	been	quick	to	assign	a	number	of	agents	to	the	task	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">recovering	the	assumed	stolen	data.	The	investigation	was	then	placed	at	the	top</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	Navy's	priority	list	and	Turner	had	summoned	Parks	to	Xalan. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>“That	fool	of	a	raider	thinks	he	is	going	to	earn	himself	a	tidy	little	sum	by selling	on	military	secrets,”	Turner	growled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	data	is	heavily	encrypted,	sir,”	Parks	offered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	beside	the	point,	Commodore!”	Turner	snapped	back	at	him.	“With</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 resources	 available	 to	 them	 the	 Enemy	 could	 crack	 it	 within	 a	 matter	 of months.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turner	 rose	 from	 his	 chair,	 taking	 one	 of	 the	 reports	 with	 him.	 Parks</p>
<p class="calibre1">glanced	 over	 at	 the	 cabinet	 by	 the	 wall.	 The	 admiral	 was	 out	 of	 White	 Label whiskey.	 Turner	 started	 to	 pace,	 mumbling	 aloud	 the	 summarised	 timeline	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">events,	as	detailed	by	Spirit	Orbital	station, </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">1710	hours	–	CSN	Cardinal	has	made	an	emergency	jump	into	the	Temper</p>
<p class="calibre1">system	and	reported	a	suspected	case	of	Shizaru's	Fever. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">1749	hours	–	Received	distress	call	from	CSN	Cardinal.	Vessel	under	attack</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	raiders. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">1751	hours	–	Contacted	nearest	patrol	group,	White	Knights,	and	requested</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	assist	Cardinal. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">1753	 hours	 –	 Dispatched	 Merekat	 and	 Buffalo	 for	 search	 and	 rescue</p>
<p class="calibre1">operation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">1811	 hours	 –	 CSN	 Cardinal	 reports	 that	 attacking	 vessels	 have	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">completely	destroyed	but	raiding	party	has	boarded. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“First	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	and	now	this,”	Turner	stopped	reading	the	log	of	the	events</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	tossed	the	report	back	onto	the	desk	to	join	the	rest.	He	stood	staring	out	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">window,	contemplating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They'd	still	need	to	build	the	ATAFs,”	said	Parks,	once	again	attempting	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">reassure	 the	 admiral.	 “That	 would	 take	 them	 several	 months,	 even	 after	 they'd deciphered	 the	 data.	 And	 as	 far	 as	 we	 have	 been	 able	 to	 determine	 the	 Enemy don't	retain	any	knowledge	of	starfighter	construction.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>“No,	they	could	do	it	much	quicker	than	that,”	Turner	said	as	he	picked	up another	 report	 and	 began	 going	 over	 it.	 “Unlike	 us	 the	 Enemy	 do	 not	 require sign-offs,	 approvals,	 security,	 money...	 They	 don't	 have	 to	 justify	 an	 enormous military	budget;	they	don't	have	to	gloss	over	expenditure	or	attempt	to	keep	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">project	under	wraps;	they	don't	have	to	sit	in	a	boardroom	full	of	suits	trying	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">explain,	 in	 basic	 terms,	 the	 long-term	 implications	 of	 non-action.	 It	 doesn't matter	 that	 they	 might	 not	 understand	 starfighter	 engineering;	 with	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">information	 about	 the	 ATAFs	 in	 their	 hands	 they'll	 certainly	 make	 the	 effort	 to learn.	And	damn	quickly	at	that,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You've	 seen	 first	 hand	 what	 that	 fighter	 is	 capable	 of,”	 Turner	 went	 on, </p>
<p class="calibre1">ignoring	 the	 commodore.	 “Imagine	 facing	 several	 dozen	 of	 those	 in	 combat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Combine	that	with	the	Enemy's	abilities	and	we	might	as	well	arm	everyone	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">low-grade	particle	cannons	for	all	the	good	it	would	do.	Then	there's	all	the	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">information	they	will	have	become	privy	to.	We	would	have	to	step	up	the	final</p>
<p class="calibre1">phase	of	the	project	without	any	guarantees.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turner	 picked	 up	 another	 report,	 reading	 it	 to	 himself	 for	 a	 time	 before</p>
<p class="calibre1">glancing	up	at	Parks	and	quoting	a	passage	out	loud.	“<i class="calibre4">Upon	resuming	our	patrol</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">we	were	contacted	by	Spirit	Orbital	who	requested	that	we	assist	</i> CSN	Cardinal <i class="calibre4">,</i> <i class="calibre4">which	had	come	under	attack.	We	arrived	to	find	signs	of	recent	combat	and	the</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Cardinal <i class="calibre4">	damaged.	I	ordered	that	the	area	be	made	secure	until	the	search	and</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">rescue	teams	could	arrive. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	see	the	 <i class="calibre4">White	Knights</i>	were	at	the	scene.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 sir.	 They	 were	 patrolling	 the	 area	 when	 they	 received	 the	 request	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">aid	 <i class="calibre4">Cardinal</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 they	 were	 unable	 to	 take	 down	 a	 single	 escaping	 craft?”	 Turner</p>
<p class="calibre1">demanded	to	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Those	 details	 are	 sketchy,	 sir.	 The	 wing	 leader	 believed	 she	 was	 acting</p>

<p class="calibre1">“de	Winter	was	leading	the	wing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	should	have	had	that	ship	blown	to	pieces	the	moment	it	was	clear	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Cardinal</i>,”	 Turner	 growled,	 flipping	 backwards	 through	 the	 pages.	 He	 had received	the	reports	less	than	an	hour	before	Parks'	arrival	and	there	was	much	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	 that	 he	 had	 skipped	 over,	 turning	 straight	 to	 the	 most	 important	 parts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Apparently	 they	 also	 encountered	 some	 unknown	 hostilities	 on	 their	 patrol... </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	the	hell's	this?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	part	of	about	some	transmission!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a>“The	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	 received	 an	 unusual	 message	 that	 they	 thought	 was	 report-worthy,”	Parks	explained,	recalling	reading	it	himself	on	the	journey	over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turner	 read	 back	 to	 get	 the	 full	 details	 of	 the	 transmission.	 Displeasure</p>
<p class="calibre1">etched	deeper	into	his	face	as	he	read	on.	Parks	knew	without	having	to	be	told</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	the	admiral	was	thinking:	this	shouldn't	be	here.	It	all	had	to	go.	The	pilot's</p>
<p class="calibre1">words	 would	 lead	 to	 questions;	 questions	 which	 would	 then	 lead	 to	 truths;	 and truths	 that	 would	 lead	 to	 panic	 on	 quite	 literally	 a	 galactic	 scale.	 And	 then	 the Enemy	would	win. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Remove	it,”	Turner	said,	dropping	the	report	back	onto	his	desk.	“As	far	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">anyone	 is	 concerned	 those	 men	 were	 Imperial	 asylum	 seekers	 fleeing	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">system's	 civil	 war.	 They	 stole	 three	 ships	 and	 ran	 the	 check	 points	 in	 the	 Alba system	before	jumping	to	Temper.	Their	ships	were	destroyed	after	they	failed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">identify	 themselves	 upon	 request	 to	 a	 Naval	 patrol	 unit,	 which	 they	 had	 also attacked.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.	I'll	have	that	updated	for	the	final	report,”	Parks	assured	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ensure	it	is,	as	well	as	the	traffic	and	activity	record	at	Alba.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 have	 someone	 take	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	 aside	 and	 ensure	 they	 do	 not	 repeat what	they	heard.	I	don't	care	who	you	get	to	do	it:	yourself,	Meyers,	Hawke,	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">whoever.	Just	make	sure	the	message	is	clear.	We	need	all	our	bases	covered	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 nodded	 again.	 “I'll	 have	 it	 done	 as	 soon	 as	 we've	 wrapped	 this	 up, </p>
<p class="calibre1">admiral.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.	I	have	to	leave	soon	to	meet	with	those	clowns	in	Office	and	I	don't</p>
<p class="calibre1">wish	to	spend	any	more	time	with	damage	control,”	Turner	growled	once	again, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	if	blaming	Parks	for	the	presence	of	the	offending	sentences.	“Now,	before	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	this	crap	started,	I	believe	you	said	that	you	had	some	news	for	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	do,”	Parks	said	with	a	wry	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turner	 scowled	 at	 the	 commodore's	 sudden	 bright	 face.	 “I	 hope	 it's	  <i class="calibre4">good</i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Word	of	mouth	had	spread	that	a	pilot	named	Kelly	(first	name	unknown)</p>

<p class="calibre1">one	person	in	this	world	who	wouldn't	continue	to	bring	that	up,	it	would	be	you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why	people	constantly	feel	the	need	to	judge	me	on	that,	I'll	never	know.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">A	 gathering	 of	 eight	 men	 and	 women,	 standing	 not	 too	 far	 from	 Estelle	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly's	table,	lowered	their	drinks	to	watch	the	scene	unfolding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	going	on?”	asked	a	man	to	the	group,	noting	the	scowl	on	Kelly's</p>
<p class="calibre1">face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 neurotic	 one	 and	 the	 spoilt	 one	 are	 fighting,”	 one	 of	 his	 drinking</p>
<p class="calibre1">companions	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 doesn't	 surprise	 me,”	 said	 another.	 “I	 don't	 think	 there's	 a	 single</p>
<p class="calibre1">person	on	the	base	that	de	Winter	hasn't	picked	a	fight	with.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	exactly	is	her	problem?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ego,”	a	woman	put	bluntly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 Kelly	 Taylor?”	 one	 of	 the	 other	 men	 asked,	 with	 a	 nod	 of	 his	 beer</p>
<p class="calibre1">bottle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	that's	de	Winter.	Taylor's	the	one	having	a	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why,	do	you	like	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She's	not	bad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don't	 bother.	 I	 share	 quarters	 with	 her.	 Really	 full	 of	 herself,	 that	 one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly's	nicer,	even	if	she's	quite	dizzy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Could	someone	explain	to	me	why	she	is	even	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a>“What	do	you	mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	if	I	were	her,	I	wouldn't	be	here.	I'd	be	spending	all	that	money	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">father's	got.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know,	you're	a	real	credit	to	the	service.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I'm	just	making	a	point.	You	probably	would,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	her	sisters?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know,	I	heard	she	hates	them?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	she	doesn't	hate	them;	they	just	don't	get	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	you	what,	I	wish	my	Dad	had	done	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Done	what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Been	a	galactic	commodities	trader.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 wasn't	 her	 Dad,	 it	 was	 her	 great,	 great	 grandfather,	 or	 something	 like</p>
<p class="calibre1">that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	wouldn't	be	able	to	do	it	these	days	anyway.	The	market	for	that	sort</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 thing	 was	 only	 around	 for	 a	 short	 time,	 before	 all	 the	 larger	 corporations started	to	get	in	on	the	act.	He	was	a	smart	man,	you	got	to	give	him	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	they	fighting	about?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	know	and	I	don't	care.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several	 of	 the	 group	 turned	 their	 backs	 on	 the	 two	 women,	 going	 back	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	they	had	been	talking	about	before	they	had	been	distracted.	One	only	half</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned	 back,	 leaning	 ever	 so	 slightly	 in	 the	 table's	 direction,	 intrigued	 to	 hear what	had	riled	Kelly	so	much. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“I	 can't	 help	 being	 who	 I	 am,	 Estelle.	 I	 didn't	 ask	 to	 be	 born	 into	 my	 family,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly	 was	 continuing	 her	 rant,	 Estelle	 not	 saying	 a	 word.	 “And	 I'm	 not	 like Susan	 and	 Gemma	 at	 all.	 If	 I	 was,	 I	 wouldn't	 be	 here	 for	 a	 start.	 I'd	 be	 being snapped	 by	 photographers,	 falling	 out	 of	 cars	 and	 nightclubs,	 so	 drunk	 I	 don't know	what	day	it	is;	working	my	way	through	some	football	team;	or	joining	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ranks	of	the	no-knicker	club.	You	know,	my	sisters	don't	even	know	what	I	do? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I've	 been	 with	 the	 CSN	 for	 nearly	 ten	 bloody	 years	 and	 they	 think	 that	 I'm	 a soldier,	part	of	the	Mobile	Infantry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 speaking	 of	 which,	 you	 need	 to	 stop	 trying	 to	 make	 up	 for	 what</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened	to	Jed.	At	least	he	wasn't	killed	and	could	walk	away	from	it...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly	stopped	talking	as	the	sentence	left	her	mouth,	instantly	regretting	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">choice	of	words.	Estelle	and	her	brother	had	both	taken	up	military	careers	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>same	 time,	 Estelle	 joining	 the	 CSN	 and	 her	 brother	 the	 CMI.	 Her	 brother	 had lasted	only	two	years	before	he	had	returned	home.	An	accident	during	a	live	fire</p>
<p class="calibre1">exercise	 had	 resulted	 in	 a	 bullet	 shattering	 his	 kneecap	 and	 leaving	 him	 with	 a permanent	 limp.	 Estelle's	 family	 had	 been	 unable	 to	 afford	 the	 corrective</p>
<p class="calibre1">surgery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	looked	uneasily	around	the	Officer's	Club	for	a	moment,	before	turning</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	to	Estelle.	In	for	a	penny,	in	for	a	pound;	she	may	as	well	get	it	all	out	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Better	Estelle	hear	it	from	her	than	somebody	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	okay,	I	know	I	can	be	flaky	sometimes,	but	the	others	have	accepted</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	and	I	don't	see	why	you	can't.	And	to	be	fair,	I	think	that	I	do	make	up	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	in	the	cockpit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,	you	need	to	stop	wanting	so	much,	so	quickly.	You	said	you	want	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	day	command	your	own	carrier,	or	battleship	or	whatever;	but	if	you	keep	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">making	enemies	here	then	you're	not	going	to	get	there	because	people	will	find</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	difficult	to	work	with.	Haven't	you	noticed	how	everyone	in	the	dorm	tiptoes</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	 you?	 Doesn't	 that	 bother	 you?	 I	 mean,	 what	 the	 hell,	 Estelle,	 are	 you going	to	be	a	bitch	your	whole	life?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	said	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly	plunged	on	further.	“And	to	be	honest,	we	have	had	a	rather	intense</p>
<p class="calibre1">few	 weeks	 with	 the	 training,	 the	 back	 and	 forth	 transfers	 from	 Gabriel,	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Temper,	to	here,	and	then	the	constant	up	and	down	to	the	station.	And	let's	not</p>

<p class="calibre1">from	time	to	time.  <i class="calibre4">Lieutenant</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her	 tirade	 over,	 Kelly	 started	 to	 wonder	 if	 she	 had	 taken	 things	 a	 bit	 far, Estelle	still	saying	nothing,	looking	anywhere	but	at	Kelly.	She	caught	the	eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 a	 group	 of	 people	 standing	 nearby,	 who	 were	 quick	 to	 look	 away.	 The	 two women	sat	in	silence	for	a	time,	looking	anywhere	but	at	each	other,	and	playing</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	their	drinks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,”	they	both	said	at	the	same	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	sorry,”	Estelle	said	again,	sweeping	her	hair	out	of	her	face.	“It's	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">that...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	don't	want	to	be	here,”	Kelly	filled	in	for	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	look	at	all	of	this,”	Estelle	gestured	around	herself.	“And	I	wonder	where</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	 went	 wrong.	 We've	 just	 gone	 from	 being	 the	 pick	 of	 the	 best	 to	 some	 dingy backwater	 system,	 shut	 away	 from	 the	 other	 squadrons,	 to	 a	 place	 where	 very little	happens.	There	don't	seem	to	be	any	prospects	for	promotion,	getting	out	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">even	 any	 real	 recognition.	 I	 almost	 feel	 like	 the	 only	 thing	 left	 for	 me	 to	 do would	be	to	quit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Quit?”	Kelly	said,	stunned. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>Estelle	shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Estelle,	 look,	 it's	 just	 a	 transitional	 period.	 We're	 not	 going	 to	 be	 here forever,”	 Kelly	 said.	 Despite	 her	 words,	 Kelly	 knew	 that	 Estelle	 would	 never quit,	 the	 woman	 was	 far	 too	 proud	 to	 do	 something	 like	 that.	 She'd	 sooner	 die than	admit	it	to	her	family	or	herself.	“For	now,	this	is	just	something	we	have	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do.	Listen,	why	don't	you	come	running	with	me	and	the	boys	tomorrow,	instead</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	bothering	yourself	with	so	much	flag	duty.	It	will	help	you	to	keep	your	mind</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	things	like	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	opened	her	mouth	to	answer	and	then	fell	quiet.	Kelly	watched	her, </p>
<p class="calibre1">stirring	her	straw	through	the	clutter	of	ice	cubes,	being	all	that	now	remained	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	cocktail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	 okay,”	 Estelle	 said.	 “I	 guess	 I	 have	 been	 neglecting	 all	 you	 guys</p>
<p class="calibre1">recently.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,	good,”	Kelly	smiled.	Estelle	smiled	back.	Satisfied	that	even	though</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 had	 been	 treading	 on	 very	 thin	 ice	 she	 had	 made	 her	 point,	 Kelly	 relaxed more.	She	once	again	looked	over	in	the	direction	of	Dodds,	Enrique	and	Chaz</p>
<p class="calibre1">who	were	sitting	not	far	from	them,	on	a	long	couch	in	the	corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	began	to	chuckle.	“Don't	stare	at	him,	Kelly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	wasn't,”	Kelly	said.	“I	was	just	wondering	who	was	winning	their	game.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmmmmmm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don't	you	sometimes	miss	being	with	Dodds?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 drink's	 all	 gone,	 Lieutenant,”	 Estelle	 said,	 crunching	 at	 the	 ice	 cubes</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	her	straw. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly	 smiled.	 Estelle	 was	 playfully	 abusing	 her	 position.	 She	 stepped	 off</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	stool.	“Same	again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Same	 again.	 And	 stop	 looking	 over	 there,”	 she	 added	 as	 Kelly	 walked</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	to	the	bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	 did,	 however,	 look	 over	 herself.	 She	 had	 noticed	 how	 Chaz	 was	 sitting with	 Dodds	 and	 Enrique,	 and	 a	 number	 of	 other	 servicemen,	 merrily	 enjoying</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	game.	His	usual	cold	demeanour	seemed	to	have	evaporated	tonight,	making</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	a	lot	more	approachable.	Even	so,	she	could	tell	he	was	still	keeping	things</p>
<p class="calibre1">close	to	his	chest.	Tonight,	he	was	neither	being	too	quiet	nor	too	loud,	either	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	could	cause	one	to	stand	out.	He	was	acting	like	a	real	blend-in,	instantly</p>
<p class="calibre1">forgettable.	 He	 also	 appeared	 to	 be	 drinking	 at	 a	 modest	 pace;	 and	 disguising</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>that	well,	too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	could	not	figure	the	man	out	and	had	heard	from	Enrique	about	how	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 hacked	 the	 Ray's	 on-board	 comms	 systems,	 to	 hook	 into	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Merekat</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nothing	more	had	been	said,	Estelle	withholding	his	actions	from	the	post-patrol</p>
<p class="calibre1">report.	In	any	case,	she	was	beginning	to	wonder	just	who	Parks	had	assigned	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	wing.	As	she	waited	for	Kelly	to	return,	she	did	her	best	to	watch	the	group</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	men	without	making	it	too	obvious. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“You	in,	Chaz?”	Enrique	asked	as	he	shuffled	the	cards	once	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dodds?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	about	you	four?	Who	are	you	again?”	Enrique	asked	the	men	sitting</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	couch	opposite	him.	They	burst	out	laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	group	were	playing	poker,	with	Enrique	acting	as	dealer.	For	the	most</p>
<p class="calibre1">part	they	were	playing	for	fun,	but	one	of	the	four	men	that	Dodds,	Enrique	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	sat	with	had	decided	to	sneak	a	bottle	of	whiskey	in	with	him,	intending	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">use	 it	 as	 an	 ice-breaker.	 The	 strong	 liquor	 had	 now	 taken	 on	 a	 new	 role	 as	 a penalty	 for	 anyone	 who	 played	 an	 appalling	 hand.	 This	 was	 becoming	 quite	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">regular	occurrence	for	Enrique,	who	had	failed	to	beat	any	of	the	other	players	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	last	few	rounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know,	mate,	if	this	were	a	casino	you'd	be	looking	for	a	new	job	round</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	now,”	Dodds	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dude,	how	much	you	'ad?”	asked	the	first	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Too	much	already,	by	the	looks	of	things,”	the	second	man	said.	“Clearly</p>
<p class="calibre1">can't	hold	his	drink.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	I	can,”	Enrique	defended	himself.	“I'm	not	that	drunk.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	so	what's	our	names	again?”	the	first	man	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique	 paused	 for	 a	 moment.	 Dodds	 watched	 him	 thinking,	 stealing	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">glance	at	Chaz	who	was	taking	a	relaxing	swig	from	his	beer	bottle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Tell	you	what,”	Enrique	said.	“Why	don't	I	just	call	you	Crew	Cut,	Tubby, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Irish	and	Shy	Boy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	four	men	exchanged	incensed	looks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	you	can't	say	they're	not	accurate,”	Enrique	slurred	a	little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oi,”	began	Tubby,	glaring.	“My	name's	Ian.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>Dodds	reached	out	and	put	a	hand	on	Enrique's	shoulder.	“No	harm,	boys,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	said,	giving	his	friend's	shoulder	a	little	squeeze	to	stop	him	saying	any	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	some	friendly	nicknames,	that's	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	besides,	I've	lost	weight	recently,”	Ian	grumbled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	 did	 you	 get	 Irish	 from?	 The	 whiskey?”	 the	 one	 Enrique	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">christened	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	accent,”	Enrique	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	accent?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	Scottish,	you	cretin!	I'm	a	McLeod!”	the	man	growled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	should	we	call	you	two,	then?”	Crew	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	wait,	I	know	these	two,”	McLeod	interrupted.	“You're	Simon	Dodds</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	Enrique	Todd:	The	Odd	Brothers.”	A	quizzical	look	crossed	the	faces	of	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">three	 companions.	 McLeod	 elaborated,	 “These	 guys	 were	 pretty	 much</p>
<p class="calibre1">inseparable	at	flight	school.	Never	used	to	be	far	from	one	another.	We	ended	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">calling	them	the	Odd	Brothers	because	they	were	so	much	like	family.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	 thanks,”	 Dodds	 said,	 holding	 up	 his	 hand	 as	 if	 to	 brush	 away	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversation	and	the	embarrassing	memories	that	it	evoked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Weren't	 you	 dating	 that	 girl,	 Esther	 or	 something?	 The	 one	 who	 thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	sun	shone	out	of	her	arse?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Estelle.	 Yeah,	 that	 one,”	 Dodds	 admitted,	 seeing	 McLeod	 look	 around</p>
<p class="calibre1">briefly	in	the	direction	of	the	woman	sat	at	a	table	by	herself.	“But,	no	we're	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeing	each	other	any	more.	She	said	she	didn't	have	time	for	me	and	wanted	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">focus	on	her	career.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shame,”	McLeod	observed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why	is	she	like	that?	So	self	absorbed,	I	mean,”	Crew	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	wants	to	make	something	of	herself,”	Dodds	started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	that's	obvious,”	Crew	scoffed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	that's	not	what	I	mean.	She	doesn't	come	from	a	particularly	well-off</p>
<p class="calibre1">family,”	 Dodds	 said.	 “She	 was	 born	 on	 one	 of	 colonies	 on	 Tilli;	 so	 you	 know how	it	is	out	there.	They	never	had	a	lot	of	money	and	had	to	get	by	mostly	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">state	benefits.	Her	parents	worked	whenever	they	could	find	it,	but	again,	you've</p>
<p class="calibre1">heard	how	it	is	there.	She	quit	school	early	so	that	she	could	try	and	help	bring	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	 cash,	 but	 it	 didn't	 make	 a	 whole	 lot	 of	 difference.	 They	 couldn't	 even	 up sticks:	they	couldn't	afford	to	settle	down	anywhere	else,	let	alone	afford	the	cost</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	transport	in	the	first	place.	So,	she	joined	the	Navy	to	prove	to	her	family	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself	 that	 she	 was	 worth	 more	 than	 all	 of	 that.	 She	 sends	 most	 of	 the	 money she	earns	home	to	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah,”	McLeod	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a>“Hmmmm,”	Dodds	added.	Whilst	he	was	aware	that	he	had	just	dished	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 great	 deal	 of	 very	 personal	 information	 about	 a	 friend	 to	 a	 group	 of	 men	 he didn't	 know,	 he	 was	 only	 trying	 to	 defend	 the	 Estelle	 that	 he	 knew	 better	 than others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Still,”	McLeod	said,	glancing	back	over	to	Estelle,	who	was	taking	a	glass</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	Kelly,	“Shame	to	have	let	that	one	go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	 she's	 been	 known	 to	 change	 her	 mind	 from	 time	 to	 time,”	 Enrique</p>
<p class="calibre1">said,	with	a	grin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	at	least	until	the	next	morning,”	Dodds	finished.	He	then	wagged	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">finger	 at	 McLeod.	 “Getting	 back	 to	 things:	 Yeah,	 I	 sort	 of	 remember	 you	 now, too.	Been	a	long	time;	nice	to	see	you	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	 you	 too,”	 McLeod	 said.	 “Drink	 this.”	 He	 thrust	 a	 whiskey	 glass, </p>
<p class="calibre1">half-filled	with	the	neat	liquor,	toward	Dodds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 withdrew	 and	 directed	 it	 towards	 Enrique.	 “You	 came	 up	 with	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">names.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique	reluctantly	took	the	glass	and	downed	it	in	one,	coughing	a	couple</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	times	before	handing	it	back.	“After	this	round,	I	will	be	passing	the	dealing</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	to	my	good	friend	Dodds	here,”	he	drawled,	scooping	his	beer	off	the	table</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 knocking	 back	 a	 good	 amount	 of	 the	 contents.	 “I	 really	 hate	 whiskey,”	 he said	to	Dodds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aw,	God	no,  <i class="calibre4">come	on</i>,”	Ian	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	first,	Dodds	thought	that	the	man	was	upset	that	he	was	not	going	to	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	chance	to	see	Enrique	make	a	speckle	of	himself.	He	then	saw	that	the	eyes	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	four	opposite	him	were	looking,	not	at	Enrique,	but	to	his	left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sitting	next	to	Enrique	were	a	couple	whose	public	display	of	affection	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	 another	 was	 beginning	 to	 encroach	 far	 too	 much	 on	 the	 poker	 game	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">everyone's	enjoyment.	When	the	male	half	of	the	couple	had	asked	if	he	could	sit</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	end	of	the	couch,	none	had	expected	that	his	companion	was	then	going	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 sitting	 on	  <i class="calibre4">him</i>	 for	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 evening	 –	 although,	 from	 Dodds'	 angle, sitting	on	him	might	not	have	been	the	best	way	to	describe	the	way	the	woman</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	been	clambering	all	over	the	man	for	the	last	fifteen	minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Guys,	guys!	Seriously,	Romeo,	get	a	room!”	Enrique	scowled	at	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 you're	 the	 guy	 to	 ask	 about	 that,	 are	 you?”	 the	 man	 answered	 him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">managing	 to	 wrench	 his	 lips	 away	 from	 those	 of	 his	 eager	 companion.	 “Don't</p>
<p class="calibre1">suppose	you've	noticed,	but	there's	little	in	the	way	of	privacy	around	here,	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	giving	us	private	quarters	like	that	lot	up	on	the	orbital.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I	hadn't	noticed	actually,”	Enrique	said.	“But	I	think	you'll	find	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	a	few	spare	mattresses	in	the	south	block	storage	room.	Shouldn't	be	too	cold</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	there,	neither.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>Dodds	 found	 himself	 impressed	 at	 both	 his	 friend's	 knowledge	 of Mandelah's	 logistical	 offerings	 and	 the	 fact	 that	 the	 tip	 seemed	 to	 do	 the	 trick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	whispered	to	the	woman	he	was	with	for	a	moment,	before	the	pair	got</p>
<p class="calibre1">up.	 He	 clapped	 Enrique	 on	 the	 shoulder	 a	 couple	 of	 times	 as	 they	 left.	 Dodds watched	them	go,	his	attention	straying	to	the	two	women	seated	on	tall	stools,	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	just	as	tall	round	table,	chuckling	to	one	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	 was	 looking	 particularly	 cheery	 tonight.	 It	 was	 nice	 to	 see	 her	 this way,	 especially	 after	 the	 disappointment	 she	 had	 suffered	 following	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">termination	 of	 their	 involvement	 in	 the	 ATAF	 project.	 She	 glanced	 at	 the	 men sitting	 around	 the	 low	 table	 and,	 catching	 his	 eye,	 smiled	 at	 Dodds.	 He	 smiled back,	then	returned	his	attention	back	to	the	game	at	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	 why'd	 you	 boys	 join	 the	 Navy,	 then?”	 Crew	 asked	 as	 they	 picked	 up</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	cards	Enrique	had	dealt	and	scrutinised	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,”	Dodds	began,	seeing	the	group's	gaze	fall	on	him.	“I	didn't	want	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">do	the	whole	nine	to	five	thing,	just	didn't	interest	me.	I	wanted	to	get	out	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 see	 and	 do	 things,	 find	 a	 bit	 of	 adventure.	 Wanted	 to	 feel	 like	 I	 was	 a	 bit more	than	some	cog	in	a	big	old	machine,	that	could	work	just	as	well	without</p>
<p class="calibre1">me.	 So,	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 day	 it	 was	 either	 this	 or	 spend	 my	 life	 looking	 after apples.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 watched	 their	 impassive	 expressions	 for	 a	 moment	 and	 then	 saw	 Ian's</p>
<p class="calibre1">face	split	into	a	grin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ahhhh,”	 Ian	 said,	 with	 a	 chuckle.	 “So,	 you	 wanted	 to	 join	 the	 Navy	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">become	a	hero!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	Dodds	said,	sitting	back	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	 you	 did,”	 Ian	 began	 to	 laugh.	 “You	 thought	 that	 if	 you	 joined	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Navy,	you'd	get	to	blow	stuff	up,	go	on	daring	missions,	earn	tons	of	medals	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	to	sleep	with	lots	of	beautiful	women.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 I	 just	 wanted	 to	 do	 something	 different,	 you	 know	 –	 give	 something</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	to	the	Confederacy;	be	a	part	of	something	special,”	Dodds	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See,”	Crew	interrupted.	“You	 <i class="calibre4">did</i>	want	to	be	a	hero.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	four	men	were	laughing	at	Dodds.	He	turned	toward	Enrique	and	Chaz, </p>
<p class="calibre1">seeking	support,	but	saw	that	they	too	were	enjoying	the	roast;	Enrique	shaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	head,	Chaz	wearing	a	thin	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Sure,	I	did	want	to	be	a	hero,	once</i>,	Dodds	thought	to	himself.  <i class="calibre4">But	I'm	back</i> <i class="calibre4">here	for	different	reasons	now. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	about	you?”	Crew	turned	his	attention	to	Enrique,	who	shielded	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">cards	 in	 case	 there	 was	 some	 ploy	 against	 him.	 Dodds	 looked	 around	 at	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">friend,	 curious	 as	 to	 how	 Enrique	 might	 answer	 the	 question.	 Few	 outside	 the <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>'	 small	 group	 were	 aware	 of	 Enrique's	 back	 story.	 Dodds	 was	 not	 even</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a>sure	if	Enrique	had	ever	told	Chaz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When	 he	 was	 eight	 years	 old,	 Enrique	 and	 his	 family	 had	 been	 returning</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 celebrating	 his	 older	 brother's	 tenth	 birthday.	 They	 had	 been	 in	 a	 car travelling	 along	 a	 motorway,	 when	 his	 father	 had	 noticed	 a	 truck	 on	 the	 other side	 of	 the	 road	 driving	 erratically.	 Enrique's	 father	 had	 taken	 precautions, deciding	to	slow	and	switch	lanes.	Just	as	he	had	done	so,	the	truck	had	swerved, </p>
<p class="calibre1">crashing	 through	 the	 central	 reservation	 and	 tipping	 onto	 its	 side,	 careening towards	them.	The	rear	of	the	truck	had	clipped	their	car	and	sent	it	tumbling,	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">speed,	up	the	roadside	embankment.	It	came	to	rest	back	on	the	road,	leaving	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">trail	of	broken	and	crumpled	chassis	parts	and	shattered	glass	behind	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emergency	services	had	been	quick	to	arrive	at	the	scene.	His	mother,	older</p>
<p class="calibre1">brother	and	little	sister	were	pulled	from	the	wreckage	of	their	car,	but	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">pronounced	dead	at	the	scene.	Along	with	his	father,	Enrique	had	been	air-lifted</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	nearest	hospital.	Despite	all	the	efforts	of	the	emergency	teams,	his	father</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	died	en	route,	owing	to	massive	internal	bleeding.	Enrique	had	survived	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	broken	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 was	 raised	 by	 his	 grandfather,	 an	 ex-military	 and	 spiritual	 man,	 who</p>
<p class="calibre1">never	failed	to	impress	upon	him	the	fact	that	someone	was	looking	out	for	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	that	he	had	survived	the	crash	for	a	reason.	Enrique	took	the	words	to	heart</p>
<p class="calibre1">and,	 spurred	 on	 by	 his	 grandfather,	 had	 signed	 up	 for	 the	 Navy,	 in	 order	 to protect	others	and	do	his	best	to	save	lives	and	keep	the	peace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	not,	however,	a	story	that	he	would	often	tell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Figured	 the	 Navy	 was	 something	 I	 would	 enjoy,”	 Enrique	 said	 with	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">shrug.	“And	I	was	no	good	at	anything	else.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sounds	 like	 that	 should	 have	 been	 your	 reason,”	 Ian	 said,	 laughing	 once</p>
<p class="calibre1">again	at	Dodds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You?”	 Crew	 looked	 at	 Chaz.	 So	 did	 Dodds	 and	 Enrique,	 more	 intrigued</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	the	man	asking	the	questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 used	 to	 fly	 interplanetary	 shuttles	 and	 landers,”	 Chaz	 said	 dismissively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“After	 nearly	 ten	 years	 of	 doing	 that,	 I	 wanted	 to	 see	 and	 do	 something	 more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 police	 force	 didn't	 interest	 me:	 too	 much	 corruption.	 So	 I	 applied	 to	 the Navy.	So	far,	I've	been	stationed	in	more	than	ten	different	star	systems	over	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">past	eight	years	and	learned	to	fly	over	half	a	dozen	different	starfighters.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh,	okay,”	Crew	said.	There	was	no	sarcasm	from	Ian	or	McLeod	over	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">explanation;	Chaz,	for	some	reason,	didn't	seem	to	warrant	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	took	a	slow	pull	from	his	bottle,	saying	nothing	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Girlfriend,	wife,	kids?”	McLeod	said,	rolling	his	hand	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“None	to	speak	of,”	Chaz	said	after	considerable	pause. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He's	 like	 your	 mate,”	 Enrique	 supplied,	 nodding	 at	 the	 fourth	 man	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>group,	who	had	contributed	little	to	the	conversation.	“Man	of	few	words.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	three	went	on	to	explain	their	reasons	for	joining	up,	how	Crew's</p>
<p class="calibre1">parents	disagreed	with	his	career	choice	because	he	was	basically	being	granted</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	license	to	murder.	He	argued	he	was	being	trained	to	protect	and	that	the	need</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	take	a	life	was	a	wholly	real	and	necessary	part	of	that	duty.	His	parents	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">asked	if	he	ever	raised	a	thought	for	the	people	in	the	ships	he	gunned	down.	Ian</p>
<p class="calibre1">chipped	 in	 and	 said	 that	 to	 him	 the	 enemy	 were	 faceless	 anyway,	 and	 may	 as well	 be	 robots.	 He	 commented	 that	 no-one	 thought	 about	 who	 they	 may	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	killed	when	they	destroyed	their	fighter.	It	didn't	matter	to	them	that	it	may</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	been	someone's	only	child,	a	mother,	a	father	of	two,	a	brother	or	sister.	At</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	end	of	the	day,	they	were	the	enemy	and	that	was	all	that	mattered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Getting	a	bit	deep,”	Dodds	said	as	the	group	lapsed	into	silence,	a	sombre</p>
<p class="calibre1">bubble	seeming	to	have	enclosed	the	group.	The	cheerful	mood	was	threatening</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	abandon	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	I'm	sobering	up,”	Enrique	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 let's	 play,”	 McLeod	 pushed	 aside	 a	 couple	 of	 cards.	 “Deal	 me	 two</p>
<p class="calibre1">more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique	 leaned	 forward	 to	 the	 little	 table	 the	 deck	 rested	 on	 and,	 after</p>
<p class="calibre1">making	a	bit	of	a	mess	of	the	pile,	managed	to	hand	the	man	two	more	cards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	no	really,	do	you	know	what	I've	been	hearing	lately?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	looked	up	from	his	cards	for	the	source	of	the	voice	and	realised	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">belonged	to	the	man	who	had	remained	relatively	quiet	for	most	of	the	game;	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	Enrique	had	called	Shy	Boy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I've	been	told	that	there's	no	Imperial	civil	war,”	Shy	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	that?”	Dodds	said	as	the	others	lowered	their	cards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">There	 is	 no	 war</i>,”	 Shy	 repeated,	 emphasising	 the	 statement	 a	 little	 more this	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	mean	they're	just	making	it	up?”	said	Enrique. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	 entirely,	 but	 they	 are	 definitely	 trying	 to	 cover	 something	 up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	 really	 bad's	 happened	 over	 there	 and	 they	 don't	 want	 people	 to	 find out	about	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 think	 they've	 been	 attacked	 by	 aliens?”	 asked	 Ian	 excitedly,	 as	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">others	pondered	the	statement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 not	 bloody	 aliens!”	 Shy	 said,	 turning	 to	 him	 with	 a	 look	 of	 utter</p>
<p class="calibre1">disdain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You've	got	to	admit,	that'd	be	pretty	cool,”	Ian	enthused,	ignoring	him,	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes	glazing	over.	“Think	of	the	architecture	and	the	tech	and	the	culture;	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	might	look	like	and	how	they'd	speak;	all	their	history	and	what	we	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">learn	from	them.	Hey!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>McLeod	had	reached	over	and	plucked	the	beer	bottle	from	the	man's	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Explorers	 have	 been	 up	 and	 down	 the	 galaxy	 for	 decades	 and	 haven't	 found</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything	more	advanced	than	bacteria	and	a	few	tiny	little	microscopic	plants,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 said.	 “So,	 can	 the	 fantasy;	 You	 won't	 be	 getting	 your	 fat	 fingers	 on	 any	 hot alien	babes!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	aliens,	then?”	Dodds	asked	of	Shy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 something	 else.	 But	 whatever	 it	 is,	 the	 Confederation's	 getting	 us	 all</p>
<p class="calibre1">ready	to	defend	ourselves	against	some	great	invasion.	Apparently,	the	Imperium</p>
<p class="calibre1">has	been	completely	wiped	out,	except	for	a	load	of	refugees.”	From	the	look	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	face,	he	was	being	completely	serious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	 told	 you	 that?”	 McLeod	 asked,	 looking	 extremely	 sceptical.	 “And</p>
<p class="calibre1">whoever	it	was,	tell	them	to	stop	smoking	so	much	crack	and	go	get	themselves</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	girlfriend.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	really.	And	something	else	I	heard	was	that	the	Navy's	been	pumping</p>
<p class="calibre1">money	 into	 some	 new	 top	 secret	 project.	 Some	 powerful	 new	 weapon, </p>
<p class="calibre1">apparently.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 forced	 himself	 not	 to	 meet	 Enrique's	 or	 Chaz's	 eyes,	 nor	 say</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything,	 and	 instead	 concentrate	 on	 what	 the	 men	 were	 saying.	 He	 could	 see, out	of	the	corners	of	his	eyes,	that	the	other	two	were	doing	the	same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	project?”	Crew	wanted	to	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	 all	 I've	 been	 told,	 so	 it	 could	 be	 anything,”	 Shy	 said	 with	 a	 shrug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	I	know	is	that	it's	costing	them	an	arm	and	a	leg.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Think	they're	building	another	battleship	to	replace	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shy	 shook	 his	 head.	 “Don't	 know,	 but	 apparently	 it's	 the	 reason	 why	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">orbital	ring	here	hasn't	been	finished.	They've	diverted	all	the	funding	that	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">meant	 to	 go	 here	 into	 that	 secret	 project.”	 He	 took	 a	 swig	 of	 his	 beer	 and	 then pointed	his	bottle	at	Crew.	“And	since	you	mention	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>,	that	goes	along	with the	whole	thing,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	so?”	Dodds	asked,	folding	up	his	cards	and	putting	them	face	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>'s	 been	 stolen,	 right?	 How	 do	 you	 do	 that?	 You	 can't	 just walk	 on	 board	 and	 take	 the	 controls.	 You'd	 need	 a	 pretty	 big	 force	 to	 achieve something	like	that,	and	that's	even	before	you	get	anywhere	near	it.	You'd	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	either	be	superhuman,	or	have	someone	on	the	inside.”	He	lowered	his	voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	continuing,	leaning	a	little	closer	to	the	table	so	that	the	others	could	hear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	Commodore	Hawke,	right,	how'd	he	survive?	I	mean,	it's	not	like	the	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	run	off	into	the	escape	pods	and	leave	his	crew	to	defend	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>,	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm	not	exactly	the	guy's	biggest	fan,	but	a	captain	goes	down	with	his	ship;	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	all	know	that	he'd	sooner	die	on	his	feet,	than	curled	up	in	a	ball	in	a	pod.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>“Most	likely	he	was	wounded,”	Crew	said.	“The	crew	chucked	him	into	the pod	 and	 shot	 him	 towards	 the	 nearest	 jumpgate.	 They	 needed	 someone	 to	 get</p>
<p class="calibre1">away,	and	top	brass	would	be	more	likely	to	believe	a	warning	coming	from	him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">than	some	delirious	petty	officer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	doesn't	explain	what	really	went	on,	though,”	Dodds	said,	somewhat</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappointed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shy	 shrugged.	 “No-one	 knows	 exactly	 what	 was	 going	 on,	 but	 from	 what</p>
<p class="calibre1">I've	heard,  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	was	out	somewhere	near	the	Imperial-Independent	border.	So</p>
<p class="calibre1">whatever's	going	down	is	getting	closer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look,	 can	 we	 stop	 with	 the	 stupid	 conspiracy	 theories,	 please?”	 McLeod</p>
<p class="calibre1">growled,	 as	 though	 he	 was	 beginning	 to	 find	 his	 colleague's	 words	 offensive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There's	 no	 secret	 project,	 no	 mass	 invasion.	 Seriously,	 who's	 telling	 you	 all this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	 I'm	 not	 saying	 anything	 else,”	 Shy	 said,	 putting	 his	 hands	 up	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">submission.	“I	heard	they	killed	the	last	guy	who	went	around	gossiping.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?”	Enrique	asked,	flabbergasted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 they	 didn't!	 Grow	 up,	 mate!”	 McLeod	 said,	 as	 Dodds	 picked	 up	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">beer.	It	was	becoming	obvious	that	McLeod	was	feeling	the	storyteller	was	now</p>
<p class="calibre1">winding	 up	 his	 audience	 unnecessarily,	 and	 was	 starting	 to	 get	 bored	 with	 the yarn,	seeing	its	 facts	being	grounded	 in	nothing	more	 than	rumour,	speculation</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	hearsay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	they	did,”	Shy	said.	“They	shot	him	when	he	tried	to	run	away	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">buried	him	in	an	unmarked	grave.	Okay,	that's	a	bit	of	an	exaggeration,	but	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">certainly	made	him	disappear.	I	think	his	name	was	Bishop	or	Nurse	or	Dean	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	like	that...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds,	in	the	middle	of	swigging	from	his	bottle,	suddenly	choked	and	spat</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	mouthful	of	beer	out	onto	the	floor.	He	proceeded	to	cough	for	a	good	while, </p>
<p class="calibre1">trying	to	clear	his	throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	okay?”	Enrique	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	 just	 went	 down	 the	 wrong	 way,”	 Dodds	 spluttered.	 Enrique	 gave</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	 a	 few	 slaps	 on	 the	 back.	 He	 noticed	 how	 everyone	 was	 still	 giving	 him	 a strange	look	as	he	continued	wiping	his	mouth	and	coughing.	“Think	that's	true</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	the	Imperium?”	Dodds	asked	Enrique,	once	he	had	calmed	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	idea.	What	do	you	think,	Chaz?”	Enrique	deflected	the	question	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	sat	on	the	far	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	you	boys	should	stop	worrying	and	have	another	drink,”	Chaz	said</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	clear	amusement.	Dodds	became	thoughtful.	Whilst	Shy	had	been	right	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	count,	perhaps	McLeod	did	have	a	point.	Maybe	the	man	was	exaggerating</p>

<p class="calibre1">up	 for	 their	 next	 big	 push.	 In	 combat,	 they	 now	 preferred	 to	 cripple	 their adversaries,	 so	 that	 the	 vessels	 could	 be	 assimilated	 into	 their	 ranks;	 only destroying	those	that	were	either	of	a	measurable	threat	or	completely	unusable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This,	she	knew,	was	the	only	reason	she	had	survived	the	attack	on	her	convoy:</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	vessel	meeting	their	requirements	only	briefly	before	it	had	started	to	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">apart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Through	 the	 near-darkness,	 she	 made	 her	 way	 back	 to	 the	 capsule	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">settled	down	inside,	having	checked	once	again	that	her	reports	were	still	secure</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	her	jacket.	With	that	little	peace	of	mind,	she	activated	the	controls	that	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">close	her	in	and	induce	the	stasis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	Natalia's	belief	that	switching	off	most	of	the	power	would	give	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Enemy	the	impression	that	the	escape	pod	had	been	drifting	for	years,	the	power</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	vital	system	components	having	broken	down	a	long	time	ago,	the	occupants</p>
<p class="calibre1">almost	certainly	dead.	She	hoped	that	the	pod	would	prove	too	small	to	be	of	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">use	to	them,	and	that	they	would	waste	no	further	time	with	it	and	move	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or	perhaps	they	would	destroy	it	anyway,	just	to	make	sure. </p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“<b class="calibre3">D</b>odds!	Hey!	Wake	up!	Wake	up!”	Dodds	blinked	awake	and	became	aware	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">three	things:	the	first	was	that	Estelle	was	standing	next	to	his	bunk,	shaking	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">vigorously;	 the	 second,	 that	 there	 was	 an	 alarm	 wailing;	 and	 the	 third,	 that	 he had	a	splitting	headache,	a	result	of	the	previous	night's	drinking	session	having</p>
<p class="calibre1">caught	up	with	him.	He	wanted	nothing	more	than	to	go	back	to	sleep	and	wake</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	much	later	on,	when	everything	had	calmed	down,	and	when	it	no	longer	felt</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	though	someone	was	tightening	a	vice	around	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	struggled	to	pull	himself	into	an	upright	position,	wincing	at	the	pain	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	head.	He	saw	that	all	around	the	quarters	other	people	were	hastily	pulling	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">boots,	trousers	and	jackets	and	running	out	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	 happening?”	 he	 asked,	 feeling	 as	 though	 his	 head	 was	 going	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">explode	at	any	minute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Enrique,	do	 <i class="calibre4">not</i>	go	back	to	sleep!	Don't	you	dare	go	back	to	sleep!”	Estelle</p>
<p class="calibre1">shouted	at	the	man	in	the	bunk	below	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	leaned	over,	taking	care	not	to	tip	himself	off	the	side	of	the	bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	come	on!”	Estelle	called	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	 right,	 don't	 shout,	 I	 heard	 you	 first	 time,”	 Enrique	 complained.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">hauled	 himself	 back	 up,	 where	 he	 sat	 hunched	 over,	 head	 in	 his	 hands.	 “Aw, man.	I	feel	like	I'm	going	to	puke.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	pulled	out	a	watch	that	he	kept	under	his	pillow	and	tried	to	focus	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	little	blue	figures	on	the	face.	It	was	just	after	four	in	the	morning;	he	hadn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">managed	more	than	three	hours'	sleep	since	settling	down.	He	felt	a	momentary</p>
<p class="calibre1">sense	of	déjà	vu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	 going	 on?”	 Dodds	 asked	 again.	 His	 eyes	 followed	 the	 figures</p>
<p class="calibre1">running	out	of	the	room	and	then	saw	the	answer	to	his	question	come	striding	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	the	quarters'	doorway,	flanked	by	two	other	staff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Commodore	 Hawke	 surveyed	 the	 scene	 in	 front	 of	 him	 with	 a	 look	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">disgust.	 “Come	 on!	 Come	 one!	 Get	 moving!”	 he	 barked,	 clapping	 his	 hands</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>together.	 “You	 hear	 that	 alarm?	 That's	 the	 call	 to	 general	 quarters!	 That	 means now!	What	are	you	standing	around	for?	Move!	Now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	 turned	 back	 to	 Dodds	 and	 mouthed	 for	 him	 to	  <i class="calibre4">get	 up	 now! </i>	 Dodds looked	 to	 Hawke	 and	 saw	 his	 attention	 shift	 to	 the	 bunk	 he	 and	 Enrique</p>
<p class="calibre1">occupied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawke's	 eyes	 narrowed	 as	 they	 fell	 upon	 Estelle.	 “What	 the	 hell	 are	 you</p>
<p class="calibre1">doing?	Did	I	not	just	make	myself	clear?	Have	you	gone	deaf?”	Hawke	asked	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	in	his	current	state,	Dodds	knew	that	Estelle	was	in	the	one	place	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	rather	not	be	at	this	point	in	time:	stood	next	to	two	members	of	her	flight</p>
<p class="calibre1">group,	 who	 did	 not	 seem	 capable	 of	 mustering	 the	 strength	 to	 pull	 themselves out	from	under	the	covers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	I	was...”	Estelle	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	 these	 little	 boys	 need	 their	 mummy	 to	 dress	 them?”	 Hawke	 growled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	then	looked	straight	at	Dodds	and	the	pilot	felt	his	heart	jump	the	moment	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">flicker	of	recognition	crossed	Hawke's	face.	“Dodds!	I	should	have	known!	How</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	it	 <i class="calibre4">possibly</i>	have	been	anyone	else?	Didn't	feel	like	getting	out	of	bed	this morning?	Decided	you	were	going	to	call	in	sick?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	gave	Dodds	a	pleading	look	not	to	answer	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	sir.	I	just	had	difficulties	sleeping	last	night,	sir,”	Dodds	said,	forcing</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself	to	answer	in	as	much	as	a	normal	tone	as	he	could	muster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well	 then,	 we'll	 see	 if	 we	 can	 get	 you	 a	 cot	 and	 a	 teddy	 bear	 for	 tonight then,	shall	we?	Now	get	your	arse	out	of	bed!”	Hawke	shot	back	with	contempt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	one	last	look	around	the	dormitory,	he	turned	on	his	heel	and	started	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	 the	 corridor.	 But	 not	 before	 issuing	 an	 ultimatum:	 “Main	 briefing	 room, Dodds!”	he	said,	pointing	a	stiff	finger.	“Three	minutes!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he	 stormed	 out	 of	 the	 room,	 Estelle	 began	 throwing	 Dodds'	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique's	 clothing	 at	 them,	 urging	 them	 to	 get	 a	 move	 on.	 Kelly	 and	 Chaz, </p>
<p class="calibre1">already	clothed,	hovered	close	by,	waiting	for	the	two	men	to	dress	themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 did	 so	 as	 fast	 as	 they	 could	 and	 together	 the	 five	 hurried	 from	 the	 now empty	dormitory,	towards	the	building	holding	the	main	briefing	hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	  <i class="calibre4">White	 Knights</i>	 entered	 the	 packed	 hall	 to	 discover	 that	 all	 of	 the	 seating, except	for	that	closest	to	the	podium,	had	already	been	taken.	Dodds	wanted	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">remain	 at	 the	 back,	 out	 of	 sight,	 happy	 to	 join	 others	 sat	 down	 on	 the	 floor, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>against	 the	 wall,	 but	 Estelle	 was	 already	 herding	 them	 to	 the	 front.	 The	 group ended	 up	 sitting	 almost	 right	 in	 front	 of	 the	 podium,	 just	 where	 Dodds	 and Enrique	 did	 not	 wish	 to	 be.	 The	 platform	 was	 occupied	 already	 by	 Parks, </p>
<p class="calibre1">standing	against	a	large	screen	that	covered	half	of	the	front	wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	watched	with	an	impatient	scowl	as	people	continued	to	stream	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	briefing	hall.	“Find	a	seat	or	some	place	to	stand	and	settle	down!”	his	voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">boomed	over	the	speakers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawke	 shoved	 his	 way	 past	 those	 standing,	 to	 get	 to	 the	 front,	 followed	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lot	 less	 aggressively	 by	 Meyers.	 Dodds	 caught	 a	 glimpse	 of	 Hawke	 stuffing	 a handkerchief	 back	 into	 an	 inside	 jacket	 pocket	 and	 saw	 that	 it	 was	 once	 again stained	with	blood.	He	wondered	in	his	hazy	mind	what	was	causing	the	man	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">receive	 so	 many	 nosebleeds.	 He	 could	 never	 remember	 him	 having	 done	 so</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	in	the	past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	said,	“We	have	a	lot	to	get	through	and	very	little	time	to	do	it,	so	pay</p>
<p class="calibre1">attention,	 all	 of	 you.”	 The	 voices	 died	 down	 and	 all	 that	 remained	 were	 the sounds	 of	 the	 shuffling	 of	 chairs	 and	 obligatory	 coughing.	 Now	 that	 he	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">everyone's	full	attention,	Parks	began	in	full. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 should	 all	 know	 that	 several	 months	 ago	 the	 Confederation	 Stellar</p>
<p class="calibre1">Navy	 flagship,  <i class="calibre4">CSN	 Dragon</i>,	 was	 boarded	 and	 subsequently	 stolen	 by	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">unidentifiable,	 but	 strongly	 numbered	 and	 armed,	 hostile	 force.	 Following	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">take	 over,	 it	 dropped	 off	 of	 all	 galactic	 surveillance	 systems	 and	 vanished</p>
<p class="calibre1">without	a	trace.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	 Parks,	 the	 screen	 showed	 images	 of	 the	 enormous	 battleship;	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	anyone	who	had	every	set	eyes	on	the	behemoth	needed	reminding.	At	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">four-and-a-half-kilometres	 in	 length,	 it	 dwarfed	 even	 the	 Confederation's	 own</p>
<p class="calibre1">carriers,	 being	 several	 times	 bigger	 than	 its	 nearest	 rival.  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,	 the	 largest	 of the	CSN's	carriers,	was	a	mere	eleven	hundred	and	thirty	meters	by	comparison. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 Parks	 continued	 to	 speak,	 the	 images	 on	 the	 screen	 behind	 him	 changed	 to show	schematics	of	the	battleship,	along	with	size	comparisons	with	other	large</p>
<p class="calibre1">vessels.	Dodds	rubbed	his	eyes,	trying	to	focus	and	keep	them	open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Without	 going	 into	 specifics,	 we	 now	 believe	 the	 theft	 to	 have	 been	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">work	 of	 one	 of	 the	 major	 factions	 fighting	 in	 the	 Imperial	 civil	 war.	 After <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	 disappeared	 it	 was	 assumed	 it	 had	 either	 been	 destroyed	 or	 had	 been abandoned	and	left	to	drift	somewhere	between	star	systems.	However,	two	days</p>
<p class="calibre1">ago	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	 reappeared	 in	 the	 independent-declared	 regions	 of	 space	 and	 has begun	making	its	way	through	some	of	the	uninhabited	systems	there.	We	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	tracking	its	progress	and	believe	that	we	are	now	in	a	position	to	intercept</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	retake	the	ship.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Murmurs	and	mumbling	began	around	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>“He's	got	to	be	kidding,”	Dodds	heard	Kelly	say	under	her	breath.	She	was staring	up	at	the	screen,	looking	staggered	by	the	news.	Dodds	recalled	the	first</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	he	had	met	Kelly,	back	at	flight	school,	and	how	one	of	the	first	things	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	spoken	to	him	about	was	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>.	Kelly,	out	of	all	the	cadets	there,	was	the only	one	to	have	ever	laid	eyes	on	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 had	 told	 him	 of	 how	 she	 had	 been	 overwhelmed	 by	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>'s	 sheer</p>
<p class="calibre1">size,	 in	 comparison	 with	 all	 the	 other	 battleships	 in	 the	 Confederation's	 fleet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Prior	to	her	joining	the	Navy,	her	father	had	managed	to	pull	a	few	strings	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">arranged	 for	 her	 to	 be	 given	 a	 tour	 of	 some	 of	 the	 CSN's	 bases	 and	 major battleships;  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	included.	The	ship	was	in	dry	dock	at	the	time,	undergoing</p>
<p class="calibre1">maintenance.	Kelly	had	found	the	sight	astounding	and	had	gushed	about	it	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">days.	At	the	time	Kelly,	had	remarked	that	it	looked	quite	menacing	and	that	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	glad	it	was	on	“their	side”. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	ship's	body	was	like	that	of	a	knife	blade,	with	only	the	merest	stub	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">hilt	 at	 the	 rear,	 housing	 three	 massive	 engines,	 complimented	 by	 four	 smaller ones	on	either	side.	The	main	body	of	the	vessel	drove	forward	to	a	point,	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">pairs	of	protrusions	in	the	middle	and	at	the	rear	following	the	overall	outline	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">its	 form.	 There	 were	 no	 major	 vertical	 structures	 anywhere	 along	 its	 length	 -</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	 a	 small	 number	 of	 elevations	 present	 to	 accommodate	 the	 bridge	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">incredible	array	of	armaments	that	dotted	the	surface. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	though	it	was	now	just	an	image	projected	onto	a	screen,	Dodds	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	that	the	sheer	magnitude	of	ship	still	staggered	her	today.	The	same	sense	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">awe	was	not	to	be	found	in	Dodds,	however.	Despite	the	enormity	of	the	news, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 found	 it	 difficult	 to	 be	 either	 impressed	 or	 interested	 as	 he	 looked	 up	 at	 the screen.	He	looked	at	Enrique,	who	was	fighting	to	keep	his	eyes	open.	Clearly, </p>
<p class="calibre1">like	himself,	the	man	was	wishing	he	could	be	somewhere	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">You've	 really	 messed	 up	 this	 time,	 Simon</i>,	 he	 thought	 to	 himself.  <i class="calibre4">You've</i> <i class="calibre4">come	 back	 to	 try	 and	 set	 things	 right,	 but	 when	 it	 comes	 to	 something	 bloody</i> <i class="calibre4">important	you're	almost	incapacitated.	Congratulations,	idiot. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">He	slid	down	a	little	into	his	seat,	to	get	more	comfortable.	Estelle	nudged</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	 to	 sit	 up.	 In	 future,	 he'd	 have	 to	 make	 a	 better	 effort	 not	 to	 sit	 next	 to	 her during	things	like	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pipe	down!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sound	of	Parks'	irritated	voice	was	quick	to	disperse	the	mumbling	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Based	on	the	intelligence	we	have	gathered,	we	anticipate	that	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	will</p>
<p class="calibre1">very	 soon	 be	 entering	 the	 Aster	 system,	 within	 an	 uninhabited	 region	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Independent	 space.	 Once	 there,	 it	 will	 be	 met	 by	 a	 large	 contingent	 of	 allied forces,	who	will	immediately	commence	 <i class="calibre4">Operation	Menelaus</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>The	 screen	 behind	 Parks	 changed	 once	 more,	 to	 show	 an	 overview	 of	 the operation	he	had	just	named,	listing	all	involved	parties	and	overall	strategy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	reappearance	of	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	within	the	independent	regions	of	space	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">raised	many	concerns	within	the	Independent	World	Council.	The	Confederation</p>
<p class="calibre1">has	been	working	closely	with	the	UNF	over	the	past	forty-eight	hours	and	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	 fully	 prepared	 to	 back	 our	 move	 to	 retake	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>.	 They	 will	 be	 laying	 on support	of	two	carriers	and	a	number	of	starfighters,	themselves.	The	main	strike</p>
<p class="calibre1">force	 will	 consist	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit	 </i> and	  <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>,	 captained	 by	 myself, Commodore	Hawke	and	Captain	Meyers	respectively.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 is	 getting	 pretty	 serious,”	 Estelle	 whispered	 in	 Dodds'	 ear.	 “They're</p>
<p class="calibre1">throwing	a	lot	of	weight	behind	this,	sending	up	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	 <i class="calibre4">and</i>	 <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 wished	 he	 could	 share	 her	 admiration.	 He	 also	 wished	 he	 had	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1">helped	 to	 polish	 off	 the	 rest	 of	 that	 whiskey	 bottle.	 He	 pulled	 back	 away	 from Estelle,	 putting	 a	 hand	 on	 his	 forehead.	 It,	 like	 most	 of	 the	 rest	 of	 him,	 was feeling	 rather	 hot.	 He	 then	 found	 himself	 wishing	 his	 hand	 was	 a	 pack	 of	 ice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There,	that	was	his	three;	and	none	of	them	had	come	true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	turned	a	lazy	head	around	the	briefing	room	to	see	that,	in	an	almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">exact	repeat	of	the	ATAF	presentation	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	had	attended	earlier	that	year, jaws	were	hanging	down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	not	misunderstand,”	Parks	boomed	over	the	returning	mumblings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	winced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	I'm	sure	all	of	you	can	fully	appreciate,  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	by	itself	in	a	combat</p>
<p class="calibre1">situation	 would	 prove	 a	 very	 formidable	 opponent;	 and	 on	 this	 occasion	 we</p>
<p class="calibre1">believe	it	to	also	be	accompanied	by	two	Imperial	frigates	and	several	starfighter</p>
<p class="calibre1">squadrons,	 all	 of	 which	 will	 have	 to	 be	 handled	 and	 dispatched	 in	 order	 to successfully	complete	the	operation.	For	this	purpose,	we	will	be	employing	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">use	of	several	fighter	squadrons	of	our	own.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 screen	 behind	 him	 changed	 once	 again,	 to	 display	 a	 representation	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	fighters,	grouped	into	squadrons.	Numbers	of	participating	types	were	listed</p>
<p class="calibre1">next	 to	 the	 flat	 two-dimensional	 images.	 There	 were	 four	 classes	 there:	 TAFs, Rays,	Rooks,	and	Hammerheads.	It	looked	as	though	there	were	three	digits	next</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 TAFs	 and	 two	 for	 the	 others,	 but	 Dodds	 could	 not	 focus	 on	 the	 exact numbers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now	 listen	 carefully,”	 Parks'	 voice	 continued	 over	 the	 hall	 speakers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	are	two	primary	objectives	in	this	mission:	the	first,	as	already	stated,	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 successful	 recovery	 and	 safe	 return	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>.	 The	 second	 is	 the apprehension	of	these	two	men...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 screen	 behind	 Parks	 changed	 again,	 displaying	 the	 two	 men	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">question.	 Both	 wore	 full	 Imperial	 naval	 dress	 and	 faced	 the	 camera	 head-on. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a>Neither	man	wore	a	cap	in	the	pictures,	though	both	were	highly	decorated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	first,	and	most	important	of	these	two,	is	Admiral	Zackaria.	He	is	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Fleet	Admiral	of	the	Imperial	Naval	Forces	and	is,	without	a	shadow	of	a	doubt, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	one	person	whom	we	cannot	afford	to	lose.	I	would	even	go	as	far	as	to	say</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 the	 capture	 of	 this	 man	 actually	  <i class="calibre4">outweighs</i>	 the	 recapture	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	 itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We	believe	that	he	may	have	been	instrumental	in	the	theft	of	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	in	the	first instance	 and	 is	 likely	 to	 also	 be	 playing	 a	 key	 role	 in	 the	 on-going	 troubles throughout	the	Imperium.	Should	he	be	aboard	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	then	he	must	not,	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	circumstances,	be	allowed	to	be	killed.	I	say	again:	 <i class="calibre4">we	need	this	man	alive</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Enrique...”	 Dodds	 heard	 Estelle	 hiss.	 He	 looked	 around	 to	 see	 Enrique</p>
<p class="calibre1">sitting	back	up	from	where	he	had	been	hunched	over,	hiccuping.	Dodds	couldn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 sure	 whether	 either	 of	 the	 three	 men	 stood	 on	 the	 stage	 were	 aware	 of	 the issues	 he	 was	 experiencing	 trying	 to	 focus	 –	 certainly	 Hawke	 would	 already</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	an	idea	–	but	he	thought	he'd	better	make	the	effort.	He	folded	his	arms	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	at	the	screen,	finding	the	black	thread,	red	trims	and	silver	buttons	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Imperial	 uniforms	 a	 little	 easier	 on	 his	 eyes,	 than	 the	 bright	 white	 glare	 of	 the previous	screens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	first	to	Admiral	Zackaria,	a	name	that	was	a	little	more	familiar</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	him	than	the	other;	he	had	heard	it	thrown	around	from	time	to	time	over	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">years,	though	not	certain	he	would	be	able	to	pick	the	man	out	of	a	line-up.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	looked	to	be	in	his	early-to-mid	sixties,	his	hair	more	or	less	gone,	leaving</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	 with	 strands	 of	 grey.	 His	 eyes,	 too,	 were	 grey	 and	 possessed	 a	 hardened edge.	 His	 face	 was	 long	 and	 clean	 shaven,	 but	 his	 skin	 appeared	 rough,	 with wrinkles,	tiny	scars	and	marks	scattered	about.	Easy	enough,	Dodds	concluded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	age	would	make	him	quite	distinctive	amongst	everyone	else	and	he	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	a	lot	easier	to	tackle	than	most.	Not	that	Dodds	wanted	to	get	involved	right</p>
<p class="calibre1">now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 second	 is	 Commodore	 Rissard,”	 Parks	 went	 on.	 “To	 our	 knowledge, </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 is	 Zackaria's	 second-in-command	 and	 right-hand	 man.	 He	 does	 not	 hold	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	sway	as	Zackaria	himself,	but	it	would	be	in	our	interest	to	bring	this	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">in,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rissard	did	not	appear	as	old	as	Zackaria,	closer	in	age	to	Parks	and	Hawke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like	Zackaria,	he	was	light-skinned,	but	with	short,	thick	blonde	spiky	hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look	at	his	eyes,”	Estelle	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	did:	they	were	unnaturally	bright	blue,	almost	as	if	they	were	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">kind	of	implant;	though	maybe	they	were	just	contact	lenses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	like	the	look	of	him,”	Kelly	murmured. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though	he	held	a	neutral	expression,	Dodds	did	acknowledge	that	the	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	 menacing;	 threatening;	 almost	 sadistic.	 Maybe	 it	 was	 those	 eyes.	 A</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>slideshow	of	images	began,	displaying	the	two	men	in	various	other	poses:	some at	 formal	 gatherings,	 others	 within	 parades.	 In	 a	 few,	 Zackaria	 could	 be	 seen with	 a	 ceremonial	 sword	 at	 his	 hip,	 and	 sometimes	 holding	 it	 in	 a	 rather	 regal fashion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 head	 began	 to	 ache	 once	 more.	 He	 eyed	 Chaz,	 seeing	 the	 big	 man</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking	 up	 the	 screen.	 He	 looked	 both	 very	 attentive	 and	 as	 fresh	 as	 a	 daisy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How?	He'd	been	drinking	too,	hadn't	he?	He'd	also	enjoyed	his	fair	share	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">whiskey,	as	far	as	Dodds	could	remember.	He	wondered	how	the	other	four	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">feeling	this	morning.	He	expected	that	McLeod's	head	was	in	a	comparable	state</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	his	own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Remember	these	faces,	people,”	Parks	said.	“I	want	to	be	assured	that	even</p>
<p class="calibre1">those	not	directly	involved	in	the	boarding	of	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	are	familiar	with	all	targets and	objectives	of	this	operation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	then	moved	on	to	describe	how	the	operation	was	to	progress.	Dodds	let</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	attention	slip	a	little,	but	listened	as	best	he	could	through	his	suffering.	As</p>
<p class="calibre1">far	 as	 he	 could	 tell	 it	 was	 to	 unfold	 this	 way:	 the	 Hammerheads,	 together	 with support	 from	 TAFs	 and	 Rays,	 would	 lead	 the	 Initial	 Run	 against	 the	 two</p>
<p class="calibre1">escorting	frigates.	Together	they	would	knock	the	frigates	out	of	action,	as	well</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	any	starfighter	support.	Once	the	path	was	clear	to	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>,	the	Confederation would	deliver	their	coup	de	grâce:	as	with	all	newer	capital	ships,  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	had	an inbuilt	security	module,	that	allowed	for	all	non-essential-to-life	functions	to	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">shut	down	remotely.	The	idea	had	been	scoffed	at	by	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>'s	design	committee</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	the	chief	engineer	had	proposed	it.	He	had	gone	ahead	and	implemented	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">regardless,	 arguing	 that	 it	 might	 come	 in	 very	 useful	 one	 day.	 And	 so	 it	 now proved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	disabled,	the	escorting	frigates	out	of	action	or	destroyed,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	a	handful	of	enemy	starfighters	to	deal	with,	the	rest	of	the	mission	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	a	cakewalk.	A	large	number	of	boarding	vessels	would	attach	themselves	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>'s	hull,	before	burning	their	way	inside	and	flooding	the	entire	ship	with toxic	 gas.	 Following	 this,	 joint	 Confederation	 and	 Independent	 World	 teams</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 board	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	 and	 perform	 a	 mop-up	 of	 any	 remaining	 enemy	 forces, before	 handing	 over	 control	 to	 Parks,	 Hawke	 or	 Meyers.	 Zackaria	 and	 Rissard</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	be	located	and	taken	aboard	a	specially	appointed	shuttle,	where	medical</p>
<p class="calibre1">teams	would	administer	treatments	as	required. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Should	 the	 security	 code	 fail	 to	 work,	 then	 the	 combined	 CSN	 and	 UNF</p>
<p class="calibre1">teams	would	attempt	to	force	boarding	by	firepower	alone.	Although	this	was	far</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	ideal,	the	allied	forces	would	at	least	still	retain	the	element	of	surprise	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">again	 seek	 to	 take	 down	 the	 frigates,	 before	 engaging	 the	 massive	 battleship itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>Or	something	like	that	anyway... </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dodds!”	It	was	Estelle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	realised	that	he	had	slumped	down	into	his	seat.	His	chin	was	on	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">chest	and	his	eyes	were	closed.	He	was	on	the	verge	of	falling	asleep.	He	opened</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 eyes	 and	 looked	 back	 up	 at	 the	 screen,	 to	 see	 what	 he	 might	 have	 missed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 was	 looking	 right	 at	 him.	 The	 commodore	 paused	 for	 a	 brief	 moment, </p>
<p class="calibre1">before	starting	to	talk	again.	He	then	stopped,	pressing	a	button	on	the	podium</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	killed	the	microphone	and	looked	at	Hawke,	who	had	gained	his	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following	the	very	brief	exchange,	he	brought	the	microphone	back	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Time	is	short,	people.	If	we	are	to	make	our	appointment,	we	need	to	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">things	underway.	You	will	be	further	briefed	on	the	strategy	upon	arrival	at	your</p>
<p class="calibre1">designated	carriers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 screen	 behind	 him	 changed	 to	 detail	 a	 list	 of	 assigned	 flight	 teams	 to carriers.	Parks	began	to	rattle	off	the	names	of	the	flight	groups	as,	behind	him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meyers	 and	 Hawke	 got	 to	 their	 feet	 and	 made	 for	 the	 exit.	 The	 assembled</p>
<p class="calibre1">personnel	sat	staring	up	at	the	screen,	waiting	for	him	to	finish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	all	sitting	there	for?”	Parks	asked	in	sudden	anger.	“At	least</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	quarter	of	you	should	be	at	your	departure	points,	waiting	for	transports.	Come</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	people!	Suit	up	and	get	moving!	Now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 fliers	 jumped	 to	 their	 feet	 as	 ordered	 and	 made	 to	 leave,	 whilst	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">commodore	continued	to	read	out	names,	departure	points	and	destinations.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">White	Knights</i>	had	been	assigned	to	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	and	the	vast	squadron	making	up	the Initial	 Run,	 meaning	 they	 would	 be	 responsible	 for	 protecting	 the	 bombers	 as they	engaged	the	Imperial	frigates,	as	well	as	clearing	the	way	for	the	boarding</p>
<p class="calibre1">parties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,	let's	go	people,”	Estelle	said,	standing	up	and	preparing	to	lead	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">team	out	of	the	briefing	room	and	prep	for	departure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 all	 right,	 man?”	 Dodds	 asked	 of	 Enrique.	 The	 man's	 eyes	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">reddened	from	where	he	had	been	vigorously	rubbing	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aw,	mate,	I	feel	like	death	warmed	up...”	Enrique	started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	two	-	come	here!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 turned	 around	 to	 see	 Parks	 glaring	 straight	 at	 him.	 The	 delegation</p>
<p class="calibre1">over,	Parks	had	turned	his	attention	to	a	new	issue:	that	of	Dodds	and	Enrique. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 clenched	 his	 fist,	 as	 if	 grabbing	 them	 by	 their	 jackets	 and	 pulling	 them towards	him.	Dodds	had	feared	this	from	the	moment	he	had	almost	drifted	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seated	right	before	the	commodore,	it	looked	as	if	he	and	Enrique's	various	sick</p>
<p class="calibre1">expressions	and	attempts	not	to	fall	asleep	had	not	gone	unnoticed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique	and	Dodds	stood	themselves	in	front	of	Parks	as	requested,	though</p>
<p class="calibre1">neither	of	them	saluted. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>Parks	looked	over	the	two	men.	“What	seems	to	be	the	diffic...”	he	started, before	wrinkling	his	nose.	“Are	you	two	 <i class="calibre4">drunk</i>?”	The	commodore	did	not	need</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	finish	the	sentence,	nor	less	ask	the	question;	the	stench	of	alcohol	emanating</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	the	two	men	already	provided	all	the	answers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 sir,	 we...”	 Dodds	 began,	 knowing	 that	 the	 very	 breath	 leaving	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">mouth	 would	 make	 it	 all	 too	 clear	 that	 he	 was	 either	 rather	 inebriated	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1">suffering	from	a	severe	hangover. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shut	 your	 mouth,	 Lieutenant!”	 Parks	 snarled.	 He	 looked	 over	 at	 the	 men</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	women	retreating	out	the	briefing	room,	seeking	a	quick	solution	to	his	new</p>
<p class="calibre1">problem.	“Lieutenant	Chang!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,”	the	man	Parks	had	called	after	turned	around	and	saluted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You're	 being	 reassigned.	 You	 and	 your	 team	 will	 now	 be	 a	 part	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Initial	Run.	The	 <i class="calibre4">White	Knights</i>	will	take	over	your	secondary	cover	duties.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 sir,”	 Chang's	 face	 lit	 up.	 It	 was	 clear	 that	 he	 was	 delighted	 that	 he would	now	be	doing	an	important	job,	instead	of	providing	menial	cover	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Confederation's	 capital	 ships.	 Should	 everything	 go	 well,	 then	 he	 and	 his	 team would	 be	 recognised	 for	 the	 essential	 role	 they	 would	 play,	 and	 perhaps	 even rewarded	for	their	hard	work	after	a	successful	operation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	looked	to	Estelle,	about	to	apologise,	when	Parks	pushed	past	him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">getting	to	her	first.	She	stood	to	attention	as	the	commodore	approached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	your	boys	sobered	up,	de	Winter!”	Parks	glared,	wagging	a	finger	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 face.	 “And	 get	 to	 that	 departure	 point	  <i class="calibre4">now</i>!	 I	 don't	 want	 any	 more	 screw ups!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 sir!	 Immediately,	 sir...”	 Estelle	 started,	 though	 Parks	 was	 already</p>
<p class="calibre1">marching	past	her	and	out	the	briefing	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“...	pair	of	complete	bloody	idiots!”	Estelle	glared	at	Enrique	and	Dodds	as	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">hurried	down	the	corridors	to	the	transport	landing	zones,	helmets	in	hand,	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">fastening	up	their	flight	suits.	“Make	sure	you	get	into	those	damn	shuttles!”	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">added	as	the	throng	of	people	threatened	to	separate	them	from	one	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	was	both	bitter	and	broken.	For	the	second	time	in	just	a	few	weeks</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 had	 been	 busted	 down,	 absolved	 of	 any	 responsibility,	 of	 any	 chance	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">prove	herself	of	her	true	worth.	It	was	starting	to	become	too	much	of	a	regular</p>
<p class="calibre1">occurrence	for	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	cool,	crisp	air	of	the	early	morning	hit	her	as	she	left	the	housing	block, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>along	with	the	crowd.	It	was	just	past	sunrise	and	spotlights	illuminated	her	path, aiding	 the	 dim	 natural	 light.	 Ahead	 of	 her,	 she	 could	 see	 the	 multicoloured marking	lights	of	landing	platforms,	flickering	in	her	view	as	they	were	obscured</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 other	 people	 rushing	 in	 front	 of	 her.	 It	 was	 a	 clear	 morning	 and	 the	 arc	 of lights	 dotted	 around	 the	 incomplete	 orbital	 ring	 could	 be	 seen	 high	 in	 the	 sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	that	this	was	the	time	to	admire	such	things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 she	 approached	 the	 landing	 zones,	 Estelle	 was	 greeted	 by	 a	 scene	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 had	 only	 seen	 in	 archived	 war	 footage:	 in	 the	 sky	 ahead	 of	 her,	 several transport	 shuttles	 were	 accelerating	 upwards	 towards	 the	 atmosphere,	 carrying</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 full	 complement	 of	 personnel.	 Pairs	 of	 strong	 blue	 engine	 light	 could	 be seen	higher	up	as	the	transports	attained	the	speeds	necessary	to	achieve	escape</p>
<p class="calibre1">velocity,	leaving	subtle	trails	of	cyan	as	they	went.	A	couple	of	dozen	transport</p>
<p class="calibre1">craft	 rested	 on	 landing	 pads,	 hatches	 open,	 personnel	 being	 crammed	 inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hovering	 in	 the	 sky	 above	 were	 more	 transports,	 waiting	 for	 landing	 pads	 to become	 free,	 so	 they	 could	 touch	 down	 and	 pick	 up	 more	 passengers.	 If	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">presentation	had	failed	to	impress	upon	anyone	the	importance	of	the	operation</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 were	 about	 to	 undertake,	 then	 what	 Estelle	 was	 witnessing	 now	 would</p>
<p class="calibre1">surely	do	the	trick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	long	since	lost	Dodds	and	Enrique,	and	looked	around	for	them	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 drew	 closer	 to	 their	 designated	 landing	 zone.	 She	 then	 spotted	 a	 big,	 dark-skinned	man	ahead	of	her,	running	to	a	transport	as	people	were	called	forward</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 one	 of	 the	 many	 air	 marshals	 present.	 Relief	 washed	 over	 her	 as	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognised	Chaz,	and	then	Enrique	and	Dodds,	following	just	a	short	way	behind</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.	The	three,	along	with	several	others,	got	into	the	transport,	which	was	quick</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	seal	its	doors	and	takeoff,	another	transport	quick	to	take	its	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 her	 boys	 well	 on	 their	 way,	 Estelle	 looked	 around	 for	 Kelly.	 Where</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 she?	 Like	 herself,	 Kelly	 was	 barely	 taller	 than	 average	 height	 and	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">amongst	 the	 taller	 men	 and	 women	 it	 was	 going	 to	 be	 hard	 to	 spot	 her.	 Estelle felt	herself	being	pushed	forward	and	glancing	around,	she	found	that	Kelly	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	behind	her.	The	woman	was	looking	more	than	a	little	concerned	as	she	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">jostled	back	and	forth,	and	Estelle	reached	her	hand	back	to	hold	on	to	her.	Not</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	to	make	sure	her	friend	was	okay,	but	to	ensure	that	her	team	made	it	onto</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	 without	 any	 problems.	 She	 could	 not	 afford	 yet	 another	 black	 mark against	her	name.	Even	after	the	heart-to-heart	she'd	had	with	Kelly	the	previous</p>
<p class="calibre1">evening,	 Estelle	 found	 it	 hard	 not	 to	 put	 her	 aspirations	 ahead	 of	 her	 friends,	 a fact	that	had	now	been	further	compounded	by	Enrique	and	Dodds'	irresponsible</p>
<p class="calibre1">drinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	took	a	firm	hold	of	Kelly's	hand	as	the	throng	pushed	her	forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ahead	of	her,	a	transport	had	filled	its	quota	of	passengers	and	was	setting	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>Now	at	the	front	of	the	crowd,	Kelly	and	Estelle	were	next. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	all	right,	Kelly?”	Estelle	looked	around	and	asked	of	her	friend.	Kelly</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	 scared	 for	 some	 reason.	 “We	 do	 this	 all	 the	 time.	 Just	 remain	 calm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	 attempted	 to	 reassure	 her	 that	 the	 shuttle	 ride	 was	 nothing	 to	 get</p>
<p class="calibre1">concerned	about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 time	 it	 just	 feels	 more	 real,”	 Kelly	 said.	 “We're	 not	 going	 on	 patrol this	time;	we're	going	on	the	offensive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	 have	 it	 fully	 planned	 out,”	 Estelle	 said,	 keeping	 an	 eye	 on	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">transport	that	was	descending	from	the	sky.	“The	CSN	always	makes	the	safety</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	those	in	service	its	top	priority.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even	before	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>,	Zackaria	and	Rissard?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even	 before	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>,	 Zackaria	 and	 Rissard.”	 Estelle	 shook	 the	 follow-up sentence	from	her	head.	There	was	always	a	first	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 transport	 landed	 and	 an	 air	 marshal	 beckoned	 them	 forward.	 Estelle</p>
<p class="calibre1">lost	 her	 grip	 on	 Kelly's	 hand	 as	 everyone	 surged	 forward.	 Parks'	 speech	 must have	hit	home	with	many. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 only	 you	 guys!”	 the	 air	 marshal	 said,	 spreading	 his	 arms	 out	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying	to	get	a	control	of	the	crowd.	“You	lot	head	over	to	that	one.	The	rest	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	get	back.	I	only	want	twelve	for	this	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking	around,	Estelle	discovered	she	had	been	separated	from	Kelly	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt	 uncomfortable	 not	 knowing	 where	 everyone	 was.	 She	 tried	 to	 rejoin	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">main	group	of	waiting	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	where	you	going	there?”	the	marshal	stopped	her	from	leaving.	“No</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	to	go	back	now.	In	you	get.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man's	hand	was	on	her	back,	pushing	her	on-board	the	transport.	Now</p>
<p class="calibre1">inside,	the	hatch	closed	and	locked,	leaving	Estelle	to	wonder	if	Kelly	had	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">it.	She	felt	the	engines	engage	and	took	up	a	position	on	the	bench,	pulling	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	familiar	restraining	harness	over	her	shoulders.	The	shuttle	was	smaller	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	ones	she	had	grown	used	to	over	the	past	few	weeks	and	held	fewer	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Space	 on	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	 would	 be	 at	 a	 premium,	 when	 compared	 to	 Spirit	 Orbital. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	 glanced	 around	 at	 the	 others	 occupying	 the	 transport,	 at	 first	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognising	any	of	the	faces.	She	then	did	a	double	take. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Andrea?”	she	asked	in	complete	surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 curly,	 blonde-haired	 member	 of	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Red	 Devils</i>	 looked	 over	 in	 the direction	of	the	voice	and	smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Estelle!”	Andrea	said,	eyes	sparkling.	“How	have	you	been?”	She	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">genuinely	pleased	to	see	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	was	stunned	at	how	chipper	Andrea	was	at	such	a	time.	“I've	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">good.	Everything's	going	very	well,”	Estelle	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a> <i class="calibre4">Andrea's	 here?	 At	 Mandelah?	 Since	 when? </i>	 Estelle	 wondered	 to	 herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Does	this	mean	that	the	</i> Red	Devils <i class="calibre4">	didn't	succeed	in	the	evaluation,	either?	Did</i> <i class="calibre4">it	go	to	the	other	team? </i>	She	forgot	their	name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	you	based	here?	I've	not	seen	you	around,”	Estelle	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	Andrea	said,	shaking	her	head,	her	curly	locks	bumping	against	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">face.	“I've	been	continuing	the	training	and	been	posted	in	a	number	of	places.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 confirmed	 it.	 Andrea's	 team	 had	 won.	 Estelle	 realised	 her	 face	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">betraying	her	sense	of	jealousy.	She	decided	not	to	ask	any	more	about	how	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">training	was	going;	about	how	Andrea	was	getting	on	flying	a	starfighter	that	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">should	have	been;	about	how	praise	was	being	piled	on	her,	for	her	great	work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	did	want	to	know	one	thing	though:	“So,	what	are	you	doing	here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Special	operations,”	Andrea	replied	with	a	knowingly	confident	wink	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	had	heard	enough.	She	sat	back	and	closed	her	eyes,	waiting	for	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">transport	to	arrive	at	it's	destination. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds,	 Enrique	 and	 Chaz	 stood	 on	 the	 flight	 deck	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,	 bunched	 up	 with several	 other	 personnel	 and	 crew	 members,	 that	 had	 disembarked	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">transport	 shuttles.	 The	 deck	 of	 the	 carrier	 was	 massive,	 spanning	 close	 to	 the entire	width	of	the	vessel	itself.	The	adjoining	launch	catapult	ran	almost	a	third</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 ship's	 length,	 the	 half-octagon-shaped	 tunnel	 lit	 at	 regular	 intervals	 as	 it stretched	off	towards	open	space. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	junior	OOD	instructed	the	new	arrivals	to	await	Parks.	As	the	numbers</p>
<p class="calibre1">began	 to	 swell,	 the	 three	 men	 were	 joined	 by	 Estelle,	 and	 then	 Kelly.	 Dodds witnessed	 a	 brief	 exchange	 between	 the	 two	 and	 guessed	 that	 Estelle	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">busying	herself	keeping	her	team	together	and	focused.	His	eyes	flickered	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 gathering	 of	 personnel	 and	 he	 noticed	 a	 tall	 woman	 with	 curly	 blonde	 hair being	 led	 away	 from	 the	 main	 assembled	 group.	 Had	 he	 seen	 her	 somewhere</p>
<p class="calibre1">before?	 His	 eyes	 followed	 her	 for	 a	 moment,	 before	 he	 noticed	 Parks</p>
<p class="calibre1">approaching.	The	assembled	group	stood	to	attention	and	saluted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome	 to	 the	  <i class="calibre4">CSN	 Griffin</i>,	 boys	 and	 girls,”	 Parks	 addressed	 them	 as transports	 continued	 to	 arrive	 and	 unload	 their	 passengers.	 “The	 ship	 you	 are standing	 on	 is	 currently	 acting	 as	 the	 CSN's	 flagship,	 in	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon' </i> s	 soon	 to	 be ended	absence.	This	is	 <i class="calibre4">my</i>	ship	and	I	expect	you	to	remember	that	at	all	times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	should	feel	both	honoured	and	privileged	to	have	been	given	the	opportunity</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>to	serve	aboard	this	vessel.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	felt	the	man's	gaze	come	in	his	and	Enrique's	direction	as	he	spoke</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	last	two	sentences.	He	watched	the	commodore	as	he	began	pacing	in	a	small</p>
<p class="calibre1">area,	hands	behind	his	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	went	on,	“As	soon	as	we	are	up	to	our	full	complement,	we	will	jump</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 Aster	 system,	 where	 we	 will	 rendezvous	 with	 the	 UNF's	 charmingly</p>
<p class="calibre1">named	twin	carriers,  <i class="calibre4">Grendel</i>	and	 <i class="calibre4">Grendel's	Mother</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“From	 there,	 we	 will	 await	 the	 arrival	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	 and	 then	 immediately commence	 <i class="calibre4">Operation	 Menelaus</i>.	 Primary	 defence	 and	 Initial	 Run	 teams	 should be	 prepared	 to	 depart	 the	 moment	 we	 arrive	 at	 our	 destination.	 Secondary</p>
<p class="calibre1">defence	 teams,”	 -	 his	 eyes	 once	 again	 flicked	 in	 the	 direction	 of	 the	  <i class="calibre4">White</i> <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	 -	 “should	 await	 further	 instructions.	 Squadron	 leaders	 will	 be	 briefed further	before	our	arrival.	Additionally,	a	full	breakfast	is	being	prepared	for	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">serving	 crew,	 so	 there	 is	 no	 need	 to	 worry	 about	 going	 into	 this	 on	 an	 empty stomach.	For	now,	prepare	yourselves	for	jump.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	his	introduction	and	points	made,	Parks	departed	the	flight	deck,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	attendants	began	clearing	personnel	as	part	of	the	jump	preparations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Have	 you	 ever	 seen	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	 in	 real	 life?”	 Enrique	 asked	 Dodds	 as	 they were	escorted	to	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	crew	quarters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	in	real	life,	only	video	footage.”	Dodds	said.	“The	only	thing	I	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	it	is	that	it's	big	and	has	a	lot	of	guns.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I've	seen	it,”	Kelly	piped	up,	trotting	up	alongside	the	pair,	in	an	attempt	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">keep	up	with	the	long	strides	the	two	men	were	making	to	match	speed	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">officer	leading	the	way.	“And	yes,	it's	big.	My	father	arranged	for	me	to	be	given</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	flyby	before	I	joined	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 we	 know,	 Kelly,”	 Dodds	 said,	 putting	 a	 hand	 up	 to	 his	 temple. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You've	told	us	about	a	million	and	one	times.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mate,	don't	bite	her	head	off,”	Enrique	jumped	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	looked	at	Kelly,	seeing	her	a	little	incensed	by	his	comment.	“Sorry, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly.	My	bloody	head	is	killing	me.	That	shuttle	ride	didn't	help	at	all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	your	own	fault,”	Kelly	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	know,”	Dodds	said.	“Okay,	so,	anything	else	you	can	tell	us	about</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	Kelly	shook	her	head.	“Nothing	that	you	don't	already	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 hope	 we'll	 be	 given	 a	 bit	 more	 information	 other	 than	 “it's	 big”,	 before we	 get	 to	 Aster	 and	 have	 to	 face	 off	 against	 it,”	 Estelle	 complained.	 “A	 basic strategy	would	be	a	good	start.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	you're	talking	basics,	then	how	about	that	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	has	a	maximum	crew</p>
<p class="calibre1">complement	 of	 just	 under	 fifty	 thousand,	 including	 starfighter	 pilots,”	 a	 man's</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a>voice	 stated.	 “And	 that	 it	 can	 also	 comfortably	 accommodate	 over	 a	 thousand fighters	in	its	hangars,	without	any	concessions	for	type.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heads	spun	around,	stunned	to	discover	that	Chaz	was	the	one	offering	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	information. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	caught	Estelle's	eye,	before	she	looked	back	at	the	big	man.	“What</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	its	weaponry?	Defences?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Numerous	 enhanced	 plasma	 and	 laser	 turrets	 and	 batteries,”	 Chaz	 said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	the	entire	ship	is	protected	by	multiple	high-powered	shield	generators;	far</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	efficient	than	a	carrier's	or	a	frigate's.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Still	wishing	you'd	asked?”	Kelly	said	to	Estelle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	ignored	Kelly	and	pressed	for	more	information.	“What	else?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	 secondary	 offensive	 armament	 consists	 of	 eight	 plasma	 accelerators,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	almost	stopped	walking.	“<i class="calibre4">Eight</i>	accelerators?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	nodded.	“Three	on	the	port	and	starboard,	two	on	the	bow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	and	Enrique	swore	simultaneously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	added,	“I'd	suggest	that	if	you're	going	to	attack	that	thing	you	should</p>
<p class="calibre1">aim	 to	 do	 it	 from	 the	 maximum	 possible	 distance,	 to	 counter	 its	 defensive</p>
<p class="calibre1">capabilities;	and	unless	you	can	apply	sheer	strength	of	numbers,	attempting	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">take	it	on	with	starfighters	alone	would	prove	next	to	impossible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	other	four	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	exchanged	disquieted	looks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	many	fighters	are	we	talking?”	Enrique	wanted	to	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“More	than	we're	taking,”	Chaz	answered,	almost	inaudibly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	had	arrived	at	the	quarters	where	they	would	be	spending	the	next	few</p>
<p class="calibre1">hours,	whilst	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	made	the	jump	to	Aster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	you	know	all	this?”	Estelle	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let's	 just	 say	 a	 little	 knowledge	 is	 a	 dangerous	 thing,	 Lieutenant,”	 Chaz</p>
<p class="calibre1">said,	pulling	himself	up	onto	a	nearby	bunk	and	lying	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	spied	one	of	quarters'	beds	past	the	others	and	made	for	it,	slumping</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	onto	the	mattress.	It	was	far	from	the	most	comfortable	thing	he	had	ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">sat	on	–	even	the	beds	at	Spirit	offered	more	–	but	right	now,	it	met	his	needs.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">sat	 for	 a	 moment,	 before	 stretching	 out	 across	 its	 length	 and	 closing	 his	 eyes, grateful	 that	 he	 could	 start	 on	 recuperating.	 What	 he	 really	 needed	 now	 was	 to get	his	hands	on	some	painkillers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	see	why	it	would	be	best	to	disable	it	before	we	attempt	to	retake	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">now,”	Kelly	commented,	settling	down	at	the	foot	of	a	bed	that	Enrique	had	also</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait,”	Estelle	said.	“You	said	the	accelerators	were	it's	 <i class="calibre4">secondary</i>	defence</p>
<p class="calibre1">system.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>“I	did,”	Chaz	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	what's	its	first?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An	anti-matter	cannon.	Only	vessel	in	existence	to	be	kitted	out	with	one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh.	I'd	forgotten	about	that,”	Kelly	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	got	a	 <i class="calibre4">what</i>?”	Enrique	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>'s	main	offensive	weapon	is	a	high-powered	cannon,	that	is	capable</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	directing	a	concentration	of	anti-matter	at	any	frontal	target,”	Chaz	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	exactly	does	that	mean?”	Estelle	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though	 Dodds	 had	 his	 eyes	 closed,	 he	 could	 tell	 that	 for	 all	 Estelle's</p>
<p class="calibre1">knowledge	 of	 the	 ins	 and	 outs	 of	 Naval	 protocol,	 Chaz	 was	 now	 speaking	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">language	that	even	she	did	not	understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 means	 it	 can	 destroy	 anything	 in	 its	 path,”	 Kelly	 explained.	 “It	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">powerful	 enough	 to	 even	 take	 down	 Spirit	 Orbital	 with	 a	 single	 shot.	 We	 don't want	to	be	in	the	way	of	that	if	it	happens	to	get	a	chance	to	use	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 handful	 of	 other	 pilots	 had	 been	 assigned	 to	 the	 same	 quarters	 as	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	and	people	began	to	chatter,	discussing	what	Chaz	had	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So	whilst	we're	all	telling	stories,	does	someone	want	to	tell	me	what's	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">special	about	this	Zackaria	guy	that	Parks	wants	so	badly?”	a	man's	voice	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He's	 the	 current	 Fleet	 Admiral	 of	 the	 Imperial	 Senate's	 naval	 forces,”	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice	spoke	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	thought	he	recognised	it,	and	tilted	his	head	to	look	over	to	see	if	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 the	 same	 fountain	 of	 knowledge	 from	 the	 previous	 night;	 the	 one	 that	 had been	 spreading	 rumours	 and	 speculation	 at	 their	 card	 game.	 It	 turned	 out	 it wasn't,	but	the	conversation	did	perk	Dodds'	interest	somewhat.	Even	so,	whilst</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	others,	with	the	usual	exception	of	Chaz,	turned	to	give	their	attention	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">speaker,	Dodds	was	happy	to	lie	back	and	listen	where	he	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	I	know	he's	the	admiral	of	the	fleet,”	the	first	man	said.	“I	was	awake</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	that	part	of	the	briefing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,	so	how	much	do	you	know	about	the	civil	war?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	there's	a	lot	of	a	dead	people	as	a	result.	As	well	as	a	huge	influx	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">asylum	 seekers	 and	 illegal	 immigrants,	 that	 I'm	 having	 to	 prop	 up	 with	 my</p>
<p class="calibre1">taxes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Apart	from	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	how	it	started	or	who's	involved	or	anything?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 Senate	 and	 the	 Emperor,	 wasn't	 it?	 Actually	 no,	 nothing,”	 the	 first</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	other	answers	of	 <i class="calibre4">no</i>	followed	thereafter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	well,	basically	there	are	two	main	sides	in	the	Imperial	civil	war:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>those	 fighting	 for	 the	 Imperial	 Senate	 and	 those	 fighting	 for	 Emperor	 Lorenzo III,”	the	storyteller	started.	“The	civil	war	began	when	the	Senate	disagreed	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Emperor's	decision	to	grant	independence	to	two	Imperial	star	systems,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">having	 another	 three	 under	 consideration.	 The	 Emperor	 was	 extremely	 popular</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	his	people	for	things	like	that,	as	well	as	improving	relationships	with	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">Independent	worlds	and	the	Confederation.	You	probably	already	know	that	until</p>
<p class="calibre1">recently	 the	 Imperium	 was	 very	 prosperous	 and	 actually	 envied	 throughout	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">galaxy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	the	first	man	scoffed.	“Can't	say	I've	really	ever	cared.	What	happens</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	there	is	their	problem,	not	mine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stop	interrupting	and	let	him	finish.	No,	really,	shut	up!	That's	an	order,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	 said.	 There	 was	 a	 pause.	 Dodds	 glanced	 over	 to	 see	 Estelle	 glaring	 at	 a man.	For	once,	he	was	glad	to	hear	Estelle	pulling	rank.	Political	yarns	tended	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">bore	him,	but	this	one	was	intriguing	enough	to	make	him	want	to	hear	what	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	 looked	 back	 to	 the	 storyteller,	 a	 thin,	 lanky-looking	 man,	 with	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bowl	haircut.	He	closed	his	eyes	as	she	said,	“Go	on,	what	happened?	Who	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	instigator?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Most	 believe	 it	 was	 the	 Senate,”	 the	 storyteller	 resumed.	 “One	 day,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Senate,	 led	 by	 the	 senior	 magistrate,	 upped	 and	 left,	 setting	 up	 house	 in	 an Imperial	 star	 system	 that	 held	 a	 majority	 interest	 in	 the	 Senate's	 position,	 and was	 as	 far	 away	 from	 the	 Emperor's	 Seat	 as	 they	 could	 get.	 They	 felt	 that	 the Emperor's	actions	were	a	threat	to	the	continued	prosperity	of	the	Imperium	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 the	 Emperor	 could	 one	 day	 bring	 about	 the	 collapse	 of	 the	 Empire.	 They said	 it	 was	 becoming	 too	 diluted	 and	 the	 constant	 undermining	 of	 the	 core</p>
<p class="calibre1">strengths	 would	 make	 it	 appear	 to	 be	 growing	 weak	 to	 the	 Independent	 worlds and	the	Confederacy.	At	the	time,	the	Senate	was	backed	by	something	like	ten</p>
<p class="calibre1">percent	of	the	Imperium.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ten	 percent?	 That's	 not	 a	 lot,”	 a	 woman	 interrupted	 the	 speaker.	 “That's</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	those	minority	parties	you	get,	the	fascists	and	the	ones	obsessed	with	trivial</p>
<p class="calibre1">matters.	I	mean	what	exactly	did	they	plan	to	do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hold	on,	I'm	getting	there,”	the	storyteller	said.	“Ten	percent	is	still	quite	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">lot	when	you	think	about	it:	it's	several	hundred	million	people	at	least.	And	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">those	 behind	 them,	 they	 attacked	 all	 the	 worlds	 that	 had	 split	 from	 the	 Empire and	then	attempted	to	assassinate	the	Emperor	himself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	but	they	failed.	And	the	Emperor,	as	was	his	nature,	invited	them	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	open	dialogue	to	resolve	the	issues	between	the	two.	The	Senate	refused	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	attempted	to	assassinate	him	again.	The	second	time	they	were	a	little	more</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>successful,	although	they	didn't	actually	manage	to	kill	him.	The	assassin	ended up	 killing	 the	 Emperor's	 wife	 and	 injuring	 the	 Emperor	 very	 badly,	 before	 he himself	was	killed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	opened	his	eyes	to	see	all	attention	was	on	the	speaker,	listening	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	 he	 had	 to	 say.	 Although	 the	 information	 he	 was	 providing	 to	 them	 could have	been	garnered	by	anyone	who	had	taken	the	time	to	follow	the	news	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 last	 few	 years,	 to	 many	 in	 the	 room	 this	 was	 new	 information;	 hot	 off	 the presses.	 Some	 others,	 outside	 the	 quarters,	 had	 stopped	 on	 their	 way	 past, </p>
<p class="calibre1">hovering	in	the	doorway	to	listen	in	to	what	the	man	had	to	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	storyteller	continued,	“Following	that	attempt	on	his	life,	the	Emperor</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn't	 hold	 back	 and	 launched	 a	 full	 scale	 assault	 on	 the	 Senate,	 deploying	 a massive	 strike	 force	 to	 the	 systems	 they	 had	 moved	 to.	 They	 completely</p>
<p class="calibre1">overwhelmed	the	forces	the	Senate	had	mustered	to	defend	themselves,	but	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Emperor	fell	short	of	wiping	them	out	completely.	He	gave	them	one	last	chance</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	yield,	rejoin	the	Empire	and	accept	his	rule,	rather	than	completely	destroying</p>
<p class="calibre1">them.	And	for	a	time	it	appeared	that	they	were	preparing	to	do	so,	but	then	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">day...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,”	the	first	man	cut	in,	sounded	already	bored	with	the	history	lesson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	what	exactly	does	this	have	to	do	with	this	Admiral	Zackaria?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Admiral	Zackaria	was	the	fleet	admiral	for	the	Imperial	Naval	Forces;	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">worked	 for	 the	 Emperor.	 But	 he	 defected	 to	 side	 with	 the	 Imperial	 Senate,	 and around	 five	 years	 ago	 they	 fought	 back	 harder	 than	 ever	 before	 and	 started	 to win	the	war.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How?”	Estelle	asked.	“You	said	that	only	a	small	fraction	of	the	Imperium</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 I	 don't	 know	 either,”	 the	 storyteller	 said.	 “But	 that's	 why	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Confederacy	 want	 him.	 Because	 whatever	 he's	 up	 to	 is	 starting	 to	 affect	 the Confederation's	own	interests.	He's	apparently	already	orchestrated	the	theft	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">Python-class	 battleship,	 and	 I	 don't	 think	 anyone	 really	 wants	 to	 stand	 around and	watch	to	see	what	he	does	next.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don't	 see	 the	 point,”	 the	 man	 whom	 Estelle	 had	 shouted	 at	 said.	 “Why</p>
<p class="calibre1">even	bother	bringing	him	in?	What	they	should	just	do	is	put	a	bullet	in	his	head</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 minute	 they	 find	 him.	 That's	 what	 I'd	 do.	 Bang!	 Would	 solve	 the	 problem straight	away.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He'll	 probably	 already	 be	 dead	 by	 the	 time	 they	 get	 to	 him,”	 a	 woman</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Jump	 completed,	 sir,”	 he	 heard	 Liu	 say,	 as	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	 and	  <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>	 came alongside.	Though	it	was	rare	for	accidents	to	occur	during	jumps,	it	was	good	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	the	other	carriers	were	still	with	them.	So	far,	so	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent.	 Open	 communications,”	 Parks	 said.	 The	 holographic	 screens</p>
<p class="calibre1">sprang	up	once	again,	and	Hawke	and	Meyers	appeared.	“Commodore,	Captain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Any	issues	to	report?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“None	here,”	said	Meyers.	“Fighters	and	transports	are	prepped	and	ready</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	be	deployed	on	your	command.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	reported	issues,”	Hawke	added.	“Also	ready	for	deployment.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 was	 a	 flash	 by	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	 starboard	 side.	 A	 jump	 point	 was	 forming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	 it	 emerged	 two	 carriers	 of	 similar	 design	 to	 that	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	 and	 her	 two companions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,  <i class="calibre4">Grendel</i>	and	 <i class="calibre4">Grendel's	Mother</i>	have	just	arrived	in	the	system,”	a	man by	the	name	of	O'Donnell,  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	head	of	communications,	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Perfect	 timing,”	 Parks	 said.	 He	 turned	 back	 to	 Meyers	 and	 Hawke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Commodore,	Captain,	deploy	your	teams.	I	want	to	ensure	that	we	are	able	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">execute	 our	 strike	 not	 only	 the	 very	 second	 enemy	 forces	 appear,	 but	 also	 if <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	 arrives	 earlier	 than	 was	 originally	 anticipated.	 The	 element	 of	 surprise should	 give	 them	 little	 chance	 to	 plot	 an	 escape	 and	 could	 well	 be	 key	 to	 our success	here	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 sir.	 I	 will	 begin	 fighter	 defence	 deployment	 immediately,”	 Meyers</p>
<p class="calibre1">said,	before	closing	the	communication	link. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	I	will	begin	preparation	for	rearguard,	Commodore,”	Hawke	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	opened	his	mouth	to	speak,	then	hesitated.	Hawke	had	volunteered	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>operate	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	and	its	full	complement	alone	as	rearguard	to	the	mission,	defending <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,  <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>,  <i class="calibre4">Grendel</i>,	and	 <i class="calibre4">Grendel's	Mother</i>.	Should	enemy	forces	manage to	attack	the	main	strike	force	from	behind,	Hawke	would	move	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	in	to	offer support.	 Parks	 had	 raised	 doubts	 about	 the	 validity	 about	 such	 a	 tactic, </p>
<p class="calibre1">suggesting	it	would	be	better	for	Hawke	to	concentrate	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>'s	strength	up	front, rather	than	reduce	their	offensive	power.	Even	so,	Hawke	had	argued	that	whilst</p>
<p class="calibre1">this	 would	 indeed	 allow	 them	 to	 take	 down	 the	 enemy	 faster,	 they	 should	 not assume	 that	 enemy	 support	 would	 not	 be	 forthcoming.	 To	 do	 so	 could	 risk	 the allied	 forces	 being	 flanked	 or	 otherwise	 surrounded	 by	 hostile	 forces,	 meaning that	retreating	from	the	system	could	prove	difficult. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	much	deliberation	Parks	had	begrudgingly	agreed	to	Hawke's	tactical</p>
<p class="calibre1">proposals.	 But	 having	 now	 arrived	 at	 Aster,	 he	 was	 once	 again	 considering</p>
<p class="calibre1">ordering	 Hawke	 to	 remain	 up	 front.	 He	 pushed	 aside	 the	 urge	 to	 enter	 into</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	 debate	 with	 the	 man,	 not	 wanting	 to	 stall	 the	 operation	 for	 even	 a second. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Very	 well,”	 Parks	 said	 to	 Hawke.	 “I	 will	 be	 in	 contact	 as	 soon	 as	 we	 are ready	to	begin	manoeuvres.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	ended	the	communication	as	another	request	came	in.	He	acknowledged</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 it	 should	 be	 received,	 and	 was	 greeted	 by	 the	 holographic	 projection	 of	 a deceptively	 young-looking	 woman.	 She	 was	 graced	 with	 near	 flawless	 olive</p>
<p class="calibre1">skin,	bright	hazel	eyes,	and	black	hair,	tied	into	a	neat	bob	on	the	top	of	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	had	met	Commodore	Sima	Mandeep	on	a	number	of	occasions	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	each	time	had	forgotten	just	how	beautiful	he	found	her.	He	had	always	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">disappointed	that	he	had	never	found	the	time	to	get	to	know	her	better.	Today</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	very	unlikely	to	offer	any	such	opportunity,	either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mandeep	presented	a	warm	smile.	“Hello,	Elliott.	Good	to	see	you	again.	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">hope	we	didn't	keep	you	waiting	long.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	 timing	 was	 perfect,	 Sima.	 We	 just	 arrived	 ourselves,”	 Parks	 said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">finding	it	difficult	not	to	return	the	woman's	smile,	something	about	it	feeling	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">whole	lot	more	personal	than	professional.	Even	her	teeth	looked	perfect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nice	setting	for	it,”	she	said,	her	eyes	shifting	to	gaze	upon	the	generous</p>
<p class="calibre1">backdrop	they	had	been	granted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 will	 be	 sure	 to	 send	 you	 a	 copy	 of	 our	 footage,	 after	 everything	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrapped	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Much	appreciated,	Commodore,”	she	smiled	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	shifted	the	conversation	back	to	the	operation.	Now	was	not	the	time</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	be	drawn	in.	“We	are	beginning	fighter	defence	preparations	and	will	shortly</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	executing	tactical	formation	manoeuvres.	As	agreed,  <i class="calibre4">Grendel</i>	 and	  <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i> will	 lead	 the	 assault	 run.	 If	 you	 could	 have	 Captain	 Silverthorne	 liaise	 with</p>

<p class="calibre1">He	 knew	 that	 Mandeep	 had	 already	 been	 fully	 briefed	 on	 every	 aspect	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 operation,	 but	 reiterated	 it	 once	 more	 to	 ensure	 that	 all	 bases	 had	 been covered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Understood.	 I	 will	 be	 in	 touch.  <i class="calibre4">Grendel's	 Mother</i>	 out,”	 Mandeep	 said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">before	her	face	disappeared	from	the	holographic	screen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	watched	from	the	bridge	as	a	variety	of	craft	streamed	from	each	of</p>

<p class="calibre1">“All	of	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	Initial	Run	fighters	and	transports	deployed	and	ready,	sir,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	was	told. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent,	 send	 word	 that	 we	 are	 ready	 to	 move	 into	 position,”	 Parks</p>
<p class="calibre1">ordered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 word	 was	 sent	 and	  <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>	 and	  <i class="calibre4">Grendel</i>	 started	 forward,	 their starfighters	following	them	like	obedient	puppies.  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	and	 <i class="calibre4">Grendel's	 Mother</i> in	turn	followed	at	a	distance,	the	four	carriers	all	moving	closer	to	the	expected</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrival	 point	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	 and	 her	 escorts.	 If	 they	 were	 too	 far	 from	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>'s arrival	point,	it	would	give	the	battleship	ample	time	to	escape	the	ambush.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1">slowed	 as	 they	 approached	 their	 designated	 positions	 and	 Parks	 addressed	 all</p>
<p class="calibre1">four	 carriers	 for	 one	 last	 time,	 before	 they	 adopted	 radio	 silence	 and	 awaited their	quarry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Manoeuvres	complete,	Commodore.	In	position,”	Meyers	reported. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	we	are,”	Silverthorne	added.	“We	have	boarding	parties	on	standby.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	position,”	Mandeep	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Rearguard	ready,”	Hawke	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 noted	 that	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	 had	 barely	 moved	 since	 arriving	 at	 their	 destination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though	 it	 irritated	 him,	 he	 chose	 to	 ignore	 it.	 Hawke	 did	 have	 a	 somewhat</p>
<p class="calibre1">persuasive	argument,	but	Parks	still	felt	that	his	command	and	firepower	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	more	appreciated	up	front.	He	once	again	buried	his	feelings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,”	he	said.	“You	should	each	be	aware	of	your	role	in	this	operation, </p>
<p class="calibre1">which	we	will	begin	the	moment	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	is	sighted.	Should	anything	unexpected</p>
<p class="calibre1">occur,	that	we	cannot	quickly	and	effectively	handle,	then	we	will	form	a	tactical</p>
<p class="calibre1">retreat.	Commodore	Hawke,	I	expect,	will	cover	us	in	such	an	event.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	will	have	my	full	support	if	such	an	event	does	arise,”	Hawke	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent,”	Parks	said.	“Excellent.	Now	we	wait.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although,	from	the	way	his	hands	had	started	to	perspire,	he	got	the	feeling</p>

<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 sat	 up	 as	 the	 red	 alert	 rang	 throughout	 the	 carrier,	 various	 orders	 and requests	sounding	from	the	PA	system	and	echoing	down	the	ship's	corridors.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">felt	 a	 sudden	 overwhelming	 compulsion	 come	 over	 him,	 and	 he	 sprang	 off	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bed	and	made	for	the	quarters'	exit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	come,”	he	said	to	the	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	are	you	going?”	Estelle	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To	 find	 somewhere	 to	 get	 a	 look,”	 Dodds	 said.	 “I've	 never	 seen	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">before,	 and	 I	 might	 never	 get	 a	 chance	 like	 this	 again.	 I	 want	 to	 see	 this	 thing with	 my	 own	 two	 eyes.”	 He	 was	 surprised	 that	 Estelle	 was	 not	 keen	 to	 do	 the same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait	 for	 me,”	 Enrique	 said,	 as	 he	 clambered	 off	 his	 own	 bed.	 Kelly</p>
<p class="calibre1">followed	suit,	stretching	as	she	did	so.	Chaz	tailed	the	two	out	the	door,	heading</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	down	the	corridor,	silent	as	ever.	Dodds	lingered	by	the	quarters'	doorway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	Dodds,	what's	the	holdup?”	Enrique	called	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	a	second,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,”	Enrique	nodded	and	continued	walking	with	Kelly	and	Chaz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	looked	back	to	Estelle	who	was	still	perched	on	the	end	of	the	bed</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	had	once	occupied.	“You	not	coming?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I'll	wait	here,”	Estelle	said,	shaking	her	head.	“If	they	need	us,	they'll</p>
<p class="calibre1">look	for	us	here,	first.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Positive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	studied	her.	She	looked	pensive.	He	made	to	head	off,	then	hesitated</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	came	back	to	the	doorway.	“Are	you	okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.	Like	I	said,	I	just	want	to	make	sure	we	can	be	contacted.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmmmm,	okay.”	Dodds	was	certain	that	Estelle,	as	he,	knew	that	it	was	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	a	well-tailored	excuse.	The	ship's	PA	system	could	be	used	to	contact	anyone</p>
<p class="calibre1">aboard	the	ship,	no	matter	where	they	were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	jogged	down	the	corridors	to	catch	up	with	the	others,	he	wondered	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	 was	 something	 else	 playing	 on	 Estelle's	 mind.	 Had	 she	 suffered	 a	 sudden attack	of	nerves	the	moment	that	the	alarm	had	started,	the	reality	of	the	situation</p>
<p class="calibre1">having	only	now	sunk	in?	Perhaps	Estelle	was	now	feeling	some	of	the	concern</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 had	 gripped	 Kelly	 back	 on	 Spirit:	 realising	 that	 they	 wouldn't	 be	 fighting against	 a	 bunch	 of	 pirates	 or	 supporting	 an	 assault	 on	 a	 small,	 little-defended</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>insurgent	installation,	but	instead	be	facing	up	against	seasoned	starfighter	pilots and	battleships. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">No</i>,	he	thought	to	himself,	catching	up	with	the	others	who	were	holding	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">door	to	the	deck	lift.  <i class="calibre4">Estelle	just	needs	time	to	prepare. </i></p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">*	*	*</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">With	the	quarters	empty,	Estelle	lay	back	on	the	bed	that	Dodds	had	vacated	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">began	 taking	 slow,	 measured	 breaths,	 her	 heart	 threatening	 to	 burst	 out	 of	 her ribcage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	stop	ringing,”	she	whispered	to	the	alarm.	“Just	stop.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Emerging	from	the	deck	lift,	Dodds	found	himself	in	the	one	part	of	the	ship	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 would	 have	 preferred	 to	 avoid,	 his	 arrival	 here	 a	 result	 of	 following	 others, who	also	wished	to	observe	the	operation. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	 bar,	 located	 on	 the	 port	 side	 of	 the	 main	 elevated	 portion	 of	 the carrier,	offered	a	panoramic	view	of	the	surrounding	space.	The	intention	was	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">provide	a	pleasant	backdrop	for	those	relaxing	and	enjoying	a	drink.	Due	to	its</p>
<p class="calibre1">position,	the	bar	was	-	aside	from	the	bridge	-	the	best	place	on	the	carrier	to	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	feel	for	what	was	happening	outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many	other	crew	members	were	already	clustered	by	the	windows	towards</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 bow	 and	 the	 four	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	 hurried	 over	 to	 see	 what	 was	 happening,	 Dodds thankful	 that	 he	 was	 spared	 the	 sight	 of	 any	 alcohol	 with	 the	 way	 that	 he	 was feeling.	 Even	 before	 he	 had	 made	 it	 to	 the	 windows,	 Dodds	 could	 hear	 people cursing	under	their	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">That</i>	is	a	big	ship,”	Chaz	said.	Taller	than	his	companions,	he	did	not	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	try	and	see	between	people's	heads,	being	able	to	look	over	them,	instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 managed	 to	 find	 himself	 a	 spot	 and	 felt	 an	 equal	 sense	 of	 pure</p>
<p class="calibre1">ambivalence.	Unmissable,	even	at	its	distance	ahead	of	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,	was	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon; </i>	the massive	battleship	lying	side	on	to	their	carrier,	looking	graceful,	yet	menacing</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 every	 aspect.	 Ahead	 of	 them,  <i class="calibre4">Grendel</i>	 and	  <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>	 could	 be	 seen approaching,	the	tiny	blue	specks	of	starfighter	engines	leading	the	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	are	the	frigates?”	Kelly	asked,	searching	in	all	directions.	She	was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>standing	on	a	chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don't	know.	Can't	see	any,”	Dodds	said,	though	he	took	little	time	to	look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	found	he	was	unable	to	tear	his	eyes	away	from	the	battleship	that	was	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">target. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Intelligence	 may	 have	 got	 it	 wrong,”	 Enrique	 said.	 “Wouldn't	 be	 the	 first</p>
<p class="calibre1">time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 had	 been	 bemused	 by	 the	 appearance	 of	 the	 stolen	 Confederation</p>
<p class="calibre1">battleship	without	its	escorts.	Not	that	it	needed	any. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	 had	 arrived	 in	 the	 system	 not	 long	 after	 the	 allied	 forces	 had completed	 their	 tactical	 manoeuvres.	 A	 jump	 point	 had	 formed	 within	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">vicinity	and	Parks	had	ordered	the	immediate	commencement	of	the	operation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bombers,	 alongside	 their	 support	 fighters,	 had	 surged	 forward	 to	 greet	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">newest	arrival	to	the	Aster	system.	Troop	transports	had	joined	just	behind	them, </p>
<p class="calibre1">ready	 to	 attach	 themselves	 to	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>'s	 hull	 and	 deploy	 their	 deadly	 cargo	 of toxic	gases	and	boarding	parties,	the	moment	the	battleship	was	disabled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Prepare	to	transmit	the	override,	Mr	O'Donnell,”	Parks	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ready	on	your	order,	sir,”	O'Donnell	said,	after	verification	at	his	console. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	the	glow	of	starfighter	engines	growing	ever	smaller,	Parks	turned	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 four	 holographic	 camera	 feeds	 he	 had	 earlier	 requested	 to	 monitor	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">operation.	 Each	 was	 sourced	 from	 a	 different	 target:	 one	 traced	 the	 starfighter and	 troop	 transports;	 another	 focused	 in	 on	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon, </i>	 herself.	 Yet	 another followed	 <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>	and	 <i class="calibre4">Grendel</i>,	and	the	last,	the	cockpit	view	of	the	leader	of the	Initial	Run	flight	group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	 from	 where	 he	 stood,	 watching	 the	 holographic	 relays,	 Parks	 found</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	sight	of	the	massive	Confederation	battleship	staggering.	The	fact	that	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">also	in	the	hands	of	the	Enemy	was	causing	him	considerable	apprehension.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	not	begin	to	imagine	what	the	pilots	seated	within	the	front-line	might	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">feeling	 at	 this	 time;	 though	 with	 the	 battleship	 having	 begun	 to	 turn	 to	 face	 its attackers,	it	could	well	be	a	sense	of	utter	foreboding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Approaching	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>,”	 the	 flight	 group	 leader	 communicated	 to	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will	be	within	weapons	range	in	sixty	seconds.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	noted	that	some	of	the	fighters	were	lowering	their	speed,	so	as	not	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">expose	themselves	to	the	battleship's	weapons	systems	too	soon,	their	wingmates</p>
<p class="calibre1">passing	them	by.	Although	both	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	and	the	carriers	that	had	come	to	meet	it</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>had	 been	 outfitted	 with	 similar	 weaponry,	 the	 turrets	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	 had	 been upgraded	to	compliment	the	ship,	granting	them	an	increased	range	and	thereby</p>
<p class="calibre1">allowing	them	to	be	fired	from	a	greater	distance.	That	distance	would	soon	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">met	by	the	flight	group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	closer	the	flight	group	drew	towards	it,	the	sharper	their	target's	details</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	into	relief.	A	graphic	of	a	magnificent,	blue-scaled	Chinese	dragon	clung</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 battleship's	 hull,	 its	 claws	 appearing	 to	 be	 latched	 deep	 into	 the	 metal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dozens	of	tall	yellow	and	red	ridges	covered	the	creature's	back,	whilst	a	pair	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">long,	 curved,	 white	 horns	 rose	 from	 the	 top	 of	 its	 head.	 Its	 mouth	 was	 open, drawn	 back	 into	 a	 ferocious	 snarl,	 displaying	 row	 upon	 row	 of	 sharp,	 pointed teeth.	Two	red	eyes	seemed	to	project	a	furious	warning,	warding	off	would-be</p>
<p class="calibre1">attackers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 now,	 Parks	 was	 satisfied	 that	 the	 flight	 group	 were	 as	 close	 as	 they</p>
<p class="calibre1">needed	 to	 be.	 He	 turned	 to	 his	 chief	 communications	 officer.	 “Mr	 O'Donnell, </p>
<p class="calibre1">send	the	code.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sending	 code,”	 O'Donnell	 acknowledged	 both	 the	 commodore	 and	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">flight	group.	He	made	two	brief	strokes	at	his	console.	“Code	sent.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	further	relayed	the	update	to	all	on	the	battlefield.	The	confirmations</p>
<p class="calibre1">came	back.	He	then	looked	back	to	the	holographic	screens	and	waited.	But	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	a	few	seconds,	great	trepidations	overcame	him	and	his	eyes	flickered	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	 display	 to	 the	 next,	 seeing	 the	 same	 thing	 in	 each:	 lights	 continued	 to illuminate	the	surface	of	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>;	windows,	portholes,	and	exterior	components, </p>
<p class="calibre1">all	 visual	 indications	 that	 the	 ship	 was	 still	 operational.	 He	 looked	 past	 the displays	 to	 the	 scene	 beyond	 the	 carrier's	 frontal	 viewport,	 considering	 that	 the feeds	 might	 not	 be	 running	 in	 real	 time,	 perhaps	 delayed	 by	 a	 few	 seconds. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	still	glittered	with	light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr	O'Donnell?	What's	happening?”	Parks	said,	not	taking	his	eyes	off	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">massive	 battleship.  <i class="calibre4">Have	 I	 just	 done	 the	 unthinkable	 and	 underestimated	 the</i> <i class="calibre4">Enemy	upon	my	very	first	engagement? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Code	was	transmitted	successfully,	sir,”	O'Donnell	replied,	fingers	darting</p>
<p class="calibre1">across	 the	 console	 to	 confirm	 what	 he	 had	 just	 done.	 “Do	 you	 want	 me	 to	 try again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will	be	within	weapons	range	in	thirty	seconds.	Please	advise,”	came	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice	of	the	flight	group	leader,	calm,	but	with	a	notable	trace	of	urgency. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks'	mind	raced	to	consider	the	possibilities	and	available	options.	There</p>
<p class="calibre1">remained	 but	 two:	 he	 could	 request	 that	 the	 code	 be	 sent	 again,	 or	 he	 could immediately	 fall	 back	 to	 their	 other	 approach.	 If	 he	 requested	 the	 code	 to	 be retried,	 it	 would	 mean	 that	 the	 fighters,	 bombers,	 and	 landing	 parties	 would	 be vulnerable	 to	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>'s	 attack	 upon	 subsequent	 failure.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a>lack	of	frigates	in	the	system	could	mean	it	would	be	easier	to	secure	a	forceful victory... </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Target	disabled,	sir,”	O'Donnell	interrupted	his	thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	looked	up	from	his	musings	and	saw	that	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	had	ceased	turning</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	now	lay	in	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	 systems	 terminated.	 Shielding,	 weapon	 systems	 and	 mechanics	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 shut	 down,”	 O'Donnell	 continued.	 “Life	 support	 is	 the	 only	 detectable</p>
<p class="calibre1">working	 component.	 There	 must	 have	 been	 a	 delay	 in	 the	 transmission	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1">reception	of	the	code.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gravitation	systems?”	Parks	asked,	looking	to	the	various	feeds	to	gain	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">better	indication	of	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>'s	impairment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Down,	sir,”	O'Donnell	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.	Relay	that	information	to	the	boarding	teams.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">So	 far,	 so	 good</i>,	 Parks	 thought.	 Aside	 from	 the	 minor	 delay,	 it	 looked	 as though	 everything	 was	 going	 according	 to	 plan.	 There	 now	 only	 remained	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">matter	 of	 flooding	 the	 interior	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	 with	 toxins	 as	 arranged,	 picking	 off any	 adversaries	 that	 may	 have	 managed	 to	 survive,	 and	 apprehending	 Admiral</p>
<p class="calibre1">Zackaria,	before	rushing	medical	assistance	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">A	 pity	 we	 could	 not	 have	 shut	 down	 life	 support,	 too</i>,	 Parks	 mused.  <i class="calibre4">There</i> <i class="calibre4">would	be	no	need	to	board	the	ship.	We	could	have	simply	towed	it	back	to	Spirit</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">and	pulled	the	bodies	out	at	the	other	end. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Phase	 one	 of	 the	 operation	 is	 complete,”	 Parks	 said	 to	 the	 holographic</p>
<p class="calibre1">images	 of	 his	 fellow	 command.	 “<i class="calibre4">Grendel</i>	 and	  <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>	 will	 continue	 as planned.  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	and	 <i class="calibre4">Grendel's	Mother</i>	will	stand	their	ground.	Should	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>'s escorts	arrive,	then	we	will	be	in	a	better	position	to	engage	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Agreed,”	came	the	resounding	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Passing	 weapons	 range,”	 the	 voice	 of	 the	 Initial	 Run's	 flight	 leader	 came</p>
<p class="calibre1">again.	 Parks	 looked	 back	 to	 the	 feed	 streaming	 from	 the	 Rook.	 Tension	 eased away	 as	 it	 and	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 flight	 group	 passed	 the	 danger	 threshold	 of <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>'s	armaments,	unchallenged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 group	 were	 bearing	 broadside	 to	 the	 battleship,	 the	 proximity	 now</p>
<p class="calibre1">meaning	that	the	flight	leader's	cockpit	view	could	no	longer	fully	accommodate</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	entire	length	of	the	colossal	vessel.	The	words	“C.S.N.	Dragon”	inscribed	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">tall,	 bold	 red	 lettering	 were	 now	 so	 close	 that	 Parks	 could	 start	 to	 make	 out where	the	paintwork	was	in	need	of	touching	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 beckoned	 to	 a	 member	 of	 the	 bridge's	 security	 team,	 who	 approached</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.	“Please	locate	Andrea	Kennedy	and	the	other	 <i class="calibre4">Red	Devils</i>,	and	ask	them	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">join	 me	 on	 the	 bridge.”	 The	 man	 saluted	 and	 made	 his	 way	 to	 the	 bridge's	 lift, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>heading	to	the	lower	decks.	Parks	returned	back	to	the	mission	still	in	progress, preparing	to	co-ordinate	and	delegate	duties	further	when	the	time	came. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Beginning	final	approach,”	the	flight	leader	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Perhaps	I've</i>	overestimated	 <i class="calibre4">the	Enemy</i>,	Parks	thought,	feeling	his	spirits	lift. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Maybe	I	can	do	this,	after	all... </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Target	is	live!	Target	is	live!”	the	voice	of	the	flight	leader	suddenly	cried</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	 the	 bridge's	 comms	 system,	 shattering	 Parks'	 illusions	 and	 bringing	 him</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	 down	 with	 a	 crash.	 The	 stunned	 man	 strode	 to	 the	 very	 front	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s bridge	 for	 a	 clearer	 view,	 feeling	 the	 need	 to	 look	 upon	 the	 battleship	 with	 his own	two	eyes,	rather	than	rely	on	the	carrier's	cameras.	The	flight	leader	was	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrong.	As	lights	on	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	sprang	back	into	existence,	disbelief	hit	him	full	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	the	hell	just	happened?”	Parks	spun	back	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Power	 has	 just	 returned	 to	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>!	 All	 systems	 are	 fully	 active!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">O'Donnell	 said,	 poring	 over	 his	 console's	 readouts.	 “Shields	 are	 returning... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weapons	and	engine	systems	are	powering	up!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Resend	the	code!”	Parks	said,	fighting	to	keep	the	shock	out	of	his	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">O'Donnell's	 fingers	 raced	 across	 the	 console.	 “<i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	 is	 rejecting	 it,	 sir!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	said	after	multiple	attempts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	flew	to	the	man's	side,	leaning	over	the	console	display	and	seeing	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">multitude	 of	 errors	 that	 were	 greeting	 O'Donnell	 upon	 each	 unsuccessful</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempt, </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>

<p class="calibre1">Clearance	Violation	–	This	incident	has	been	reported</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Abort!	 Abort!”	 the	 cries	 of	 the	 flight	 leader	 came	 once	 more	 over	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bridge's	 comms	 system,	 accompanied	 by	 the	 noise	 of	 screaming	 computer</p>
<p class="calibre1">systems,	warning	him	of	multiple	weapon	locks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	watched	as	the	man	pulled	out	of	his	approach	to	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>,	trying	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	his	might	to	shake	off	the	battleship's	targeting	systems.	All	around	him,	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">craft	could	be	seen	attempting	the	same.	Parks	caught	sight	of	a	massive	turret</p>
<p class="calibre1">swinging	around	to	face	the	flight	leader.	His	eyes	shifted	to	another	of	the	feeds, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a>seeing,	 moments	 later,	 bright	 green	 bolts	 of	 plasma	 belch	 forth,	 striking	 those behind	him,	scoring	critical	hits	on	some,	whilst	obliterating	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	half-dozen	bolts	become	a	veritable	hail	of	fire,	luminous	bright	green</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Pulling	 ba-”	 the	 flight	 leader	 began,	 before	 the	 audio	 became	 an	 ear</p>
<p class="calibre1">splitting	screech	of	static.	The	video	tore,	froze,	and	then	shut	off	altogether.	In</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	 feed,	 Parks	 saw	 the	 damaged	 Rook	 wheel	 for	 a	 brief	 second	 before	 it exploded,	unable	to	evade	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>'s	cannons	any	longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 sound	 of	 loud	 voices	 spilled	 from	 the	 holographic	 links	 of	 the	 three</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	 frontal	 carriers	 as	 they	 became	 a	 hive	 of	 noise,	 the	 captains	 barking	 new orders	 to	 their	 teams,	 instructing	 them	 to	 fall	 back	 and	 move	 out	 of	 weapons range.	They,	as	he,	all	appeared	stunned	by	the	battleship's	miraculous	recovery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 swallowed.	 This	 dragon	 had	 been	 watching	 them	 the	 whole	 time;	 it</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	just	been	pretending	to	sleep.	And	unless	he	was	able	to	take	back	control	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 operation	 that	 seemed	 to	 be	 falling	 apart	 in	 front	 of	 him,	 there	 was	 little doubt	that	the	Enemy	would	not	hesitate	to	turn	the	full	power	of	the	battleship</p>
<p class="calibre1">against	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	fought	to	realign	himself	and	concentrate	on	falling	back	to	attempting	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">forceful	victory.	With	the	absence	of	the	frigates,	it	might	just	be	possible.	Just</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 he	 prepared	 to	 do	 so,	 his	 eyes	 were	 grabbed	 by	 one	 of	 the	 remaining	 three feeds...	and	his	blood	froze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 the	 allied	 fighter	 squadron	 all	 but	 destroyed	 and	 its	 power	 restored, </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	continued	to	turn,	bringing	its	bow	around	to	face	 <i class="calibre4">Grendel</i>,	the	closest	of the	allied	vessels	to	it.	All	along	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>'s	bow,	locks	and	components	began	to release,	shifting	and	docking	into	new	positions.	Gears	engaged.	A	vertical	seam</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared,	 running	 the	 length	 of	 the	 bow.	 The	 seam	 split,	 both	 sides	 moving</p>
<p class="calibre1">aside,	as	if	a	great	mouth	were	opening;	the	throat	a	cold,	dark	tunnel,	leading	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">oblivion.	 Parks	 felt	 his	 own	 throat	 close	 up,	 as	 the	 implications	 of	 the	 move became	all	too	clear:	the	Enemy	were	preparing	to	use	the	battleship's	main	gun. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Grendel</i>	had	made	little	progress	in	its	attempt	to	evade	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>'s	attention, and	 as	 the	 enormous	 battleship	 brought	 itself	 around	 to	 face,	 Parks	 wished	 for nothing	 more	 than	 to	 be	 able	 to	 leap	 through	 the	 screen	 and	 pull	 them	 out	 of harm's	way.	But	instead,	he	stood	rooted	to	the	spot.	There	was	nothing	he	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">do.	 Silverthorne	 was	 shouting	 orders,	 his	 image	 turned	 away	 in	 the	 projection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	then	looked	back	and	Parks	saw	terror	in	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had	 it	 not	 been	 for	 the	 fact	 that	 the	 man	 had	 turned	 grey	 during	 his	 early twenties,	 Parks	 may	 have	 thought	 that	 the	 predicament	 Silverthorne	 now	 faced</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 wholly	 responsible	 for	 his	 appearance.	 Parks	 stared	 at	 him,	 as	 he	 looked</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>back	in	silence.	The	somewhat	stone-faced	man	paled	as	he	lowered	his	eyes	to looked	out	of	 <i class="calibre4">Grendel</i>'s	frontal	viewport. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Edward...”	Parks	started,	before	his	own	eyes	fell	to	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>'s	holographic</p>
<p class="calibre1">feed.	For	a	few	seconds,	the	battleship's	“throat”	was	lit	by	an	intense	violet	hue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	fired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	looked	like	an	enormous	bright	white	ball	leapt	from	the	front	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Confederation	 battleship	 and	 hurtled	 towards	  <i class="calibre4">Grendel</i>	 at	 a	 staggering	 velocity, taking	 mere	 seconds	 to	 traverse	 the	 distance	 between	 the	 two	 vessels,	 where	 it struck	 it	 broadside	 on.	 A	 tremendous	 explosion	 followed,	 for	 an	 instant</p>
<p class="calibre1">appearing	brighter	than	the	Sun	and	causing	Parks	to	shield	his	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silverthorne's	 feed	 died,	 the	 CSN	 insignia	 replacing	 it	 as	 it	 had	 done	 with the	 flight	 leader's.	 Parks	 blinked,	 staring	 out	 the	 front	 of	 his	 ship	 to	 where <i class="calibre4">Grendel</i>	had	once	stood.	One	moment	it	was	there	and	the	next...	nothing.	Not	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">single	 piece	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Grendel</i>	 remained.	 All	 that	 could	 be	 seen	 was	 a	 shower	 of particles,	 that	 began	 to	 spread	 out	 and	 diminish,	 rippling	 as	 an	 invisible	 wave expanded	behind	them.	The	sea	of	debris	that	often	followed	the	destruction	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">such	a	large	vessel	was	nowhere	to	be	seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	 dear	 God,”	 a	 shocked	 voice	 came.	 Parks	 saw	 that	 Mandeep	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">covering	her	mouth,	her	breathing	coming	short,	her	eyes	wide	with	disbelief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Commodore.”	It	was	Meyers.	“We	need	to	begin	our	counter-offensive	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">soon	 as	 possible.	 If	 we	 do...	 could...	 t...	 Spirit.”	 The	 signal	 broke	 up	 like	 a television	 signal	 in	 a	 thunderstorm.	 On	 one	 of	 the	 remaining	 feeds,	 Parks	 saw <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>	 buffeted	 by	 the	 expanding	 shock	 wave.	 “We	 cannot	 risk	 losing	 any more	vessels	to	that	cannon,”	Meyers	concluded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although	Parks	knew	that	it	would	be	quite	sometime	before	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">able	 to	 muster	 the	 energy	 required	 to	 use	 such	 a	 weapon	 again,	 whilst	 it</p>
<p class="calibre1">remained,	 the	 cannon	 was	 a	 formidable	 threat.	 He	 found	 himself	 in	 agreement</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	but	one	of	Meyers'	statements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Abort	 the	 mission!”	 he	 barked.	 “All	 ships,	 prepare	 to	 jump	 out	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">system!	 Mr	 Davies,	 order	 the	 launch	 of	 all	 available	 fighters,	 to	 cover	 our retreat!”	 There	 was	 an	 unpleasant	 awareness	 that	 he	 was	 almost	 certainly</p>
<p class="calibre1">condemning	those	men	and	women	to	death.	But	at	this	very	moment,	he	had	to</p>

<p class="calibre1">He	heard	a	console	begin	a	frenzied	jingle.	“What's	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	jump	point	forming!”	the	operator	responded. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Dodds	halted	in	his	departure	from	the	bar,	running	to	meet	the	call	for	pilots,	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 brilliant	 flash	 lit	 the	 room,	 light	 reflecting	 off	 the	 windows	 and	 wooden furnishings.	 Many	 of	 the	 other	 occupants	 had	 already	 left,	 but	 he,	 as	 with	 his fellow	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>,	had	found	it	hard	to	tear	his	eyes	off	the	scene	beyond. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	had	been	applause	when	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	had	been	shut	down,	gasps	upon	its</p>

<p class="calibre1">hail	 of	 green	 bolts,	 clear	 even	 from	 where	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	 stood,	 flew	 around	 in	 every direction,	striking	targets	and	triggering	explosions	as	they	fell.	He	saw	then,	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	had	said,	the	fighter's	attempts	at	returning	fire	was	but	a	token	gesture	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">best,	 their	 weapons	 no	 match	 for	 the	 tough	 defences	 of	 the	 Confederation</p>

<p class="calibre1">“What's	 that?”	 Enrique	 stopped	 beside	 him,	 staring	 out	 the	 tall	 port	 side</p>
<p class="calibre1">windows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Jump	point!”	Chaz	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 swore	 as	 he	 saw	 the	 bow	 of	 a	 large	 vessel	 come	 into	 view, </p>
<p class="calibre1">accelerating	 out	 from	 the	 point	 and	 coming	 to	 bear	 right	 alongside	 them.	 An arrangement	 of	 four	 red	 triangles	 came	 into	 view;	 the	 insignia	 of	 the	 Imperial naval	forces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	one	of	the	frigates!”	Chaz	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dear	God,	that	thing's	close!”	Dodds	staggered	back.	He	was	able	to	read</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	vessel's	designation	along	the	side,	with	no	trouble	whatsoever.	Never	in	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">life	had	he	seen	a	manoeuvre	such	as	this.	The	frigate	was	so	close	to	them	that	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	-	in	astronavigational	terms	-	within	spitting	distance.	It	could	not	have	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">four	 hundred	 meters	 from	 them,	 if	 that.	 One	 tiny	 error	 in	 its	 heading	 and	 the sides	of	both	ships	would	have	been	touching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 the	 frigate's	 heading	 was	 precise	 and	 its	 course	 put	 it	 perfectly	 in	 line with	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	no,	no,	no!”	Dodds	cried	as	the	he	saw	cannons	turn	to	face	the	carrier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 words	 had	 not	 even	 left	 his	 mouth	 when	 the	 frigate	 opened	 fire, </p>
<p class="calibre1">engaging	its	entire	starboard	battery	at	once	and	strafing	the	carrier's	broadside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 first	 volley	 of	 fire	 was	 quick	 to	 cut	 down	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	 shielding,	 leaving	 the salvo	that	followed	free	to	slam	into	the	unprotected	hull	of	the	ship	and	tear	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">gaping	 hole	 in	 the	 armour.	 There	 were	 cries	 from	 the	 crew	 as	 fires	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">explosions	 engulfed	 them,	 before	 several	 interconnecting	 corridors	 were	 then</p>
<p class="calibre1">exposed	 to	 the	 vacuum	 of	 space.	 Emergency	 systems	 sprung	 into	 action	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sealed	off	the	 affected	areas,	but	 not	before	several	 unfortunate	personnel	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>jettisoned	through	the	gap. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	 lurched	 violently	 and	 Dodds	 crashed	 to	 the	 floor,	 the	 air	 being forced	out	of	his	lungs.	Kelly	and	Enrique	fell	down	beside	him.	Of	the	few	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">remained	 in	 the	 bar,	 Chaz	 was	 the	 only	 one	 who	 managed	 to	 steady	 himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">against	 the	 jolt.	 Dodds	 rolled	 onto	 his	 side	 to	 watch	 the	 frigate	 pass	 by.	 Its	 fat, cylindrical	 body	 reminded	 him	 of	 an	 assault	 rifle,	 the	 long	 shaft	 of	 a	 cannon affixed	to	the	underside	of	the	bow	making	suggestions	of	a	bayonet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seconds	 later,	 a	 slew	 of	 starfighters	 joined	 it,	 streaking	 past	 the	 bar's</p>
<p class="calibre1">windows.	 Dodds	 could	 only	 assume	 that	 they	 had	 all	 entered	 into	 the	 system</p>
<p class="calibre1">together	and	hoped	that	there	were	not	more	jump	points	surrounding	the	carrier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 had	 no	 time	 to	 find	 out	 -	 the	 view	 became	 obscured	 by	 the	 closing	 blast screens,	sealing	off	the	vulnerable	glass	windows,	in	case	they	should	shatter	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">expose	the	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	all	right?”	Enrique	said,	helping	Kelly	to	her	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,”	Kelly	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	got	up,	seeing	Chaz	attending	to	another	of	the	bar's	occupants,	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared	to	have	suffered	a	more	serious	fall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chaz,”	he	said,	making	his	way	over	towards	the	body	that	was	sprawled</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	across	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He's	okay,”	the	big	man	looked	around	at	him.	“Just	unconscious.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Simon	-	Estelle,”	Kelly	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	we	need	to	find	her,”	Dodds	said	and	started	towards	the	deck	lift. </p>

<p class="calibre1">From	the	bridge	of	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>,	Admiral	Zackaria	watched	the	ensuing	carnage	with</p>

<p class="calibre1">From	 where	 he	 stood,	 he	 could	 see	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	 guns	 blazing,	 firing	 at	 attacking enemy	targets.	He	felt	no	sense	of	shame	in	watching. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	begging	your	pardon,	but	I	think	we	should	offer	our	assistance,”	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">Hawke	looked	at	him	through	cold	eyes.	“If	you	question	my	command	one</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,”	Parsons	said,	lowering	his	own	eyes	to	his	screen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	is	requesting	communications,”	Hawke	heard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Put	 them	 on,”	 Hawke	 said,	 folding	 his	 arms	 and	 carrying	 a	 look	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">impatience.	A	holographic	screen	sprang	up	on	front	of	him,	Parks	appearing	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	display. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 could	 use	 your	 help	 up	 here,	 Anthony,”	 Parks	 said	 earnestly.	 “The</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Mother</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	think	that's	such	a	good	idea,”	Hawke	said.	“Moving	all	our	forces</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	front	could	leave	us	even	more	vulnerable.	As	already	agreed,  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	will	hold position	here,	to	prevent	enemy	forces	from	being	able	to	surround	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But...	Are	you	serious?!”	Parks	spluttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 position	 is	 clear,”	 Hawke	 said.	 Ahead	 of	 him,	 he	 could	 see	 small</p>
<p class="calibre1">explosions	dotted	around	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,	where	starfighter	fell	and	missiles	connected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks'	 face	 became	 stern.	 “Commodore	 Hawke,	 your	 commitment	 to	 this</p>

<p class="calibre1">Parks	 stopped	 talking,	 his	 holographic	 image	 turning	 away	 as	 someone</p>

<p class="calibre1">“They	 seem	 to	 have	 things	 under	 control,”	 Hawke	 said	 quietly,	 his	 face</p>
<p class="calibre1">impassive.	 “Hold	 position,”	 he	 called	 to	 the	 bridge,	 not	 taking	 his	 eyes	 off	 the scene	outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	 explosion	 appeared	 towards	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	 bow	 and	 the	 carrier's	 once-stable course	 began	 to	 deteriorate,	 many	 of	 the	 lights	 all	 about	 the	 ship	 flickering, before	they	extinguished	altogether. </p>

<p class="calibre1">and	 was	 filled	 with	 smoke.	 The	 events	 that	 had	 led	 him	 to	 finding	 himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">sprawled	out	on	the	floor	escaped	him,	and	he	realised	that	he	must	have	blacked</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	for	a	few	seconds.	He	noticed	a	man	on	the	floor	next	to	him,	with	a	glazed</p>

<p class="calibre1">As	Parks	had	spoken	to	Hawke,	a	member	of	the	bridge	crew	had	alerted	him	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 damaged	 Imperial	 fighter	 streaking	 towards	 them.	 Even	 in	 its	 damaged	 state, the	 pilot	 had	 been	 a	 master	 of	 his	 craft	 and	 had	 managed	 to	 guide	 it	 straight towards	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	launch	bay,	whilst	evading	all	the	carrier's	attempts	to	bring	it down.	 As	 it	 had	 disappeared	 from	 view,	 security	 cameras	 all	 about	 the	 flight deck	had	relayed	the	short,	but	terrible	seconds	that	followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deckhands	had	watched	horrified	as	the	last	bursts	of	the	fighter's	cannons</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	eliminated	what	remained	of	the	bay	quadrant's	already	weak	shielding	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sped	down	the	launch	tunnel	towards	them.	There	were	cries	of	panic	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">crew	 and	 awaiting	 pilots,	 before	 people	 had	 fled	 in	 all	 directions,	 some</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempting	 to	 take	 cover	 behind	 cargo	 containers	 whose	 contents	 would	 offer</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing	but	a	much	swifter	death.	A	missile	had	detached	from	the	bottom	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fighter,	 slamming	 into	 the	 forcefield	 that	 lay	 ahead.	 With	 its	 last	 obstacle overcome,	 and	 with	 nothing	 left	 to	 stop	 it,	 the	 Imperial	 fighter	 had	 slammed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a>straight	in	a	row	of	waiting	TAFs,	all	in	the	process	of	being	rearmed,	where	it had	gone	on	to	do	the	most	damage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Its	 unspent	 payload	 of	 missiles	 had	 exploded,	 along	 with	 its	 reactor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unopposed,	the	blast	had	ripped	its	way	across	the	entire	deck,	which	-	as	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">its	nature	-	was	stocked	full	of	volatile	equipment.	The	resulting	chain	reaction</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 impacted	 almost	 every	 area	 of	 the	 ship,	 including	 the	 bridge,	 the	 total damage	being	nothing	short	of	astronomical. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 felt	 a	 warm	 flow	 on	 the	 side	 of	 his	 head.	 He	 placed	 his	 hand	 against	 his temple	and,	even	in	the	half-light	of	the	bridge,	could	see	the	blood	covering	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">fingers.	His	left	arm	was	also	aching	from	where	he	had	fallen	on	it.	From	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bridge's	frontal	viewport,	he	could	see	that	the	carrier	was	no	longer	aligned	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 on-going	 battle	 and	 that	 the	 blast	 must	 have	 thrown	 them	 off	 course.	 The view	was	skewed,	no	longer	aligned	at	an	angle	appropriate	to	the	task. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	back	to	the	bridge	itself,	trying	to	see	down	its	length,	but	finding</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 the	 smoke	 and	 haze	 was	 making	 it	 almost	 impossible	 to	 see	 what	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">happening	 around	 him.	 There	 was	 a	 sudden	 loud	 clunking	 noise,	 the	 sound	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">emergency	 systems	 engaging,	 and	 the	 bridge	 was	 filled	 with	 dim	 lighting, </p>
<p class="calibre1">allowing	 Parks	 to	 see	 the	 true	 extent	 of	 the	 damage:	 consoles	 sparked	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">smoked;	people	lay	slumped	forward	in	their	chairs,	burns	all	about	their	bodies, </p>
<p class="calibre1">where	equipment	had	exploded	in	front	of	them.	Parks	hoped	that	for	their	sakes</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	were	already	dead.	Others	were	struggling	to	their	feet,	some	trying	to	wake</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	unconscious	and	checking	them	for	injuries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Talk	 to	 me,	 people!”	 Parks	 called,	 his	 voice	 a	 distant	 sound	 even	 in	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">own	head,	as	he	struggled	to	regain	all	his	senses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here,	Captain,”	a	voice	answered.	It	was	Liu.	Aside	from	the	bruising	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 face	 and	 an	 injured	 left	 arm,	 he	 looked	 none	 the	 worse	 for	 wear,	 more shocked	 than	 anything;	 though	 the	 inability	 to	 take	 his	 eyes	 off	 the	 dead,	 still form	of	O'Donnell	was	not	helping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stay	calm,	Lieutenant,”	Parks	urged	the	man,	drawing	his	focus	away	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	corpse.	“Are	you	hurt?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	sir.	Well,	I	am	a	little,	but	nothing	I	can't	cope	with,	sir,”	Liu	managed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">his	eyes	dropping	once	again	to	the	corpse	splayed	out	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	reached	out	and	put	a	hand	on	the	man's	shoulder.	“I	need	you	to	stay</p>
<p class="calibre1">focused	and	maintain	order	here,	Ali.	Can	you	do	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a>“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good,	 you	 have	 the	 bridge,”	 Parks	 said.	 “I	 have	 to	 get	 to	 the	 flight	 deck and	find	out	what	the	hell's	happened.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,”	Liu	said,	managing	to	tear	his	eyes	off	O'Donnell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaving	 Liu	 to	 focus	 on	 getting	 the	 bridge	 back	 to	 order,	 Parks	 hurried	 to the	stairwell,	limping	as	he	went. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Estelle	stumbled	down	the	poorly-lit	corridors	of	the	carrier's	lower	deck,	trying</p>
<p class="calibre1">desperately	 to	 locate	 the	 other	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>.	 She	 had	 been	 making	 her	 way	 towards the	flight	deck	when	the	Imperial	fighter	had	crashed	onto	it,	plunging	the	entire</p>
<p class="calibre1">ship	into	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 had	 been	 lying	 on	 the	 bed	 vacated	 by	 Dodds,	 when	 the	 call	 for	 pilots</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	come	in.	She	started	towards	the	quarters'	door,	when	a	loud	explosion	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 rocking	 of	 the	 carrier	 knocked	 her	 off	 her	 feet	 and	 sent	 her	 tumbling</p>
<p class="calibre1">backwards,	 causing	 her	 to	 strike	 her	 head	 against	 one	 of	 the	 metal	 beds.	 The blow	had	not	caused	any	serious	damage,	but	had	left	her	with	a	headache.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	now	experiencing	a	dull	ache,	that	smarted	with	each	step	she	took. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	had	to	find	Dodds,	Kelly,	Enrique	and	Chaz.	She	had	decided	to	head</p>
<p class="calibre1">straight	 to	 the	 flight	 deck,	 in	 anticipation	 of	 finding	 them	 there.	 Other	 crew members	 were	 running	 and	 pushing	 past	 her,	 hurrying	 to	 deal	 with	 their	 own</p>
<p class="calibre1">problems.	As	she	continued	her	journey,	she	discovered	an	emergency	door	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">cutting	 off	 her	 most	 direct	 route.	 She	 doubled	 back,	 attempting	 to	 find	 another way	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Estelle!”	 a	 desperate	 voice	 cried	 out	 to	 her.	 Along	 a	 smoky	 corridor,	 just off	 from	 the	 one	 she	 walked	 down,	 a	 woman	 lay	 on	 her	 back,	 buried	 beneath wreckage	 that	 had	 fallen	 from	 the	 ceiling.	 From	 where	 Estelle	 stood,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wreckage	appeared	to	have	trapped	the	woman's	legs	and	one	of	her	arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	started	forward	to	try	to	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be	careful!”	the	woman	shouted	to	Estelle	as	she	approached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Andrea?!”	 Estelle	 asked,	 startled	 as	 she	 saw	 who	 it	 was	 trapped	 beneath</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	collapsed	steel.	She	gingerly	walked	forward,	wary	of	any	loose	sections	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	roof	that	may	not	yet	have	fallen,	as	well	as	dangling	electricals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Estelle,	help	me...	No-one	will	stop	to	help	me...	Please,”	Andrea	pleaded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	 looked	 around	 herself	 for	 a	 way	 to	 help	 her	 remove	 the	 wreckage, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 could	 see	 nothing	 that	 could	 be	 of	 any	 assistance.	 “What	 happened?”	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a>asked,	kneeling	down	next	to	Andrea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	were	heading	for	the	bridge,	the	others	were...	walking	just	in	front	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">me...	The	wall	ahead	of	us	exploded.	I	managed	to	grab	on	to	something,	but	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">others...”	she	started	to	weep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	were	spaced!	 I	couldn't	save	 them,	Estelle!	Their	 faces...	I	watched</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	die,”	she	said	through	the	sobs.	“I	tried	to	find	another	way	to	the	bridge... </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	then	the	ceiling	came	down	on	top	of	me...	Estelle,	I	can't	move	my	legs...	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">hurts	so	much...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 had	 become	 apparent	 to	 Estelle	 that	 Andrea's	 legs	 had	 been	 crushed	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	collapsed	roof,	and	that	the	same	fate	had	befallen	the	woman's	trapped	arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 grabbed	 at	 some	 of	 the	 steel,	 trying	 to	 find	 a	 way	 to	 pry	 it	 loose.	 When	 it became	 clear	 that	 it	 was	 not	 going	 to	 budge,	 she	 moved	 around	 to	 try	 another section.	 She	 only	 managed	 to	 move	 a	 handful	 of	 light	 parts,	 before	 the	 heavier portions	 of	 the	 wreckage	 defeated	 her.	 Andrea	 watched	 her	 the	 whole	 time, </p>
<p class="calibre1">coughing	and	sobbing.	Estelle	ducked	down	next	to	the	woman,	trying	to	see	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	was	a	way	to	pull	her	out	from	under	the	mess.	There	was	none. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	 going	 to	 find	 help,”	 Estelle	 said,	 standing	 up.	 “I	 won't	 be	 long,	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">promise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,”	Andrea	managed,	gravely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	 hurried	 away,	 darting	 down	 the	 corridors,	 looking	 for	 someone	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">assist	her.	Few	paid	her	any	attention,	Estelle	unable	to	get	the	words	out	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	person	she	tried	to	stop	pushed	past	her,	and	those	that	did	listen	already	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">higher	 priorities.	 She	 wished	 that	 the	 others	 were	 here	 now.	 The	 five	 of	 them would	 have	 little	 trouble	 freeing	 the	 trapped	 woman.	 Even	 Enrique	 and	 Chaz</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 have	 had	 enough	 strength	 between	 them.	 Eventually,	 a	 man	 and	 woman</p>
<p class="calibre1">followed	her	back	to	the	scene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Andrea,”	she	called,	returning	to	the	trapped	woman's	side.	“I've	got	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don't	worry,	we'll	have	you	free...”	She	stopped	talking	and	knelt	by	the	curly-</p>
<p class="calibre1">haired	 blonde,	 seeing	 her	 eyes	 open,	 staring	 straight	 upward,	 a	 trickle	 of	 blood running	from	her	mouth.	“Andrea?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 woman	 who	 had	 followed	 Estelle	 knelt	 by	 her	 side	 and	 felt	 Andrea's</p>
<p class="calibre1">neck.	She	then	shook	her	head.	“She's	dead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Help	me!”	a	hysterical	cry	came	from	behind.	Estelle	saw	the	woman	next</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	her	turn	around,	and	then	spring	up	to	assist	the	owner	of	the	voice.	She	heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">those	 that	 had	 accompanied	 her	 to	 where	 Andrea	 lay,	 urging	 someone	 to	 keep</p>
<p class="calibre1">calm,	before	all	three	hurried	from	the	scene,	their	voices	fading	away	down	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">corridor	as	they	went. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	saw	none	of	it,	her	eyes	focused	on	Andrea's	face,	racked	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>guilt	of	the	jealousy	she	had	felt	only	hours	earlier.	She	reached	down	and	closed the	dead	woman's	eyes,	no	longer	wishing	she	could	be	in	her	place. </p>

<p class="calibre1">An	out	of	breath	Parks	arrived	at	one	of	the	flight	deck's	observation	galleries;	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 least,	 what	 remained	 of	 it.	 All	 access	 to	 the	 deck	 had	 been	 sealed	 off,	 blast doors	preventing	anyone	from	getting	any	closer	to	the	source	of	the	devastation</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	had	crippled	the	carrier.	Even	the	gallery	refused	to	permit	its	occupants	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">idea	of	the	destruction	that	lay	beyond:	thick	blast	screens	covered	the	windows, </p>
<p class="calibre1">allowing	them	to	see	no	further	than	the	inside	of	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 smouldering	 remains	 of	 terminals	 and	 computer	 screens,	 as	 well	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">shattered	 glass	 covering	 the	 ground,	 was	 all	 that	 remained	 to	 suggest	 what	 the gallery's	 purpose	 may	 have	 been.	 Everything	 around	 Parks	 was	 charred	 black, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	damage	spreading	down	the	approaching	corridor.	The	doors,	which	usually</p>
<p class="calibre1">slid	 open	 automatically	 as	 they	 were	 approached,	 had	 to	 be	 pushed	 apart	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand.	 As	 on	 the	 bridge,	 people	 were	 attending	 to	 the	 wounded	 and	 trying	 to revive	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kneeling	 down	 on	 the	 floor,	 just	 inside	 the	 doorway,	 was	 a	 woman</p>
<p class="calibre1">attending	to	the	injuries	of	a	man,	propped	up	against	a	wall.	His	face	was	quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">bloody,	the	result	of	a	wound	somewhere	on	the	top	of	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain,”	 he	 said	 upon	 seeing	 Parks	 enter.	 He	 pushed	 aside	 the	 woman's</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand	and	attempted	to	get	to	his	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	 you	 were,”	 Parks	 said,	 waving	 him	 back	 down.	 Though	 they	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">injured,	Parks	had	found	that	some	of	the	carrier's	crew	still	attempted	to	adhere</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 a	 certain	 standard	 of	 correctness.	 Right	 now,	 he	 did	 not	 want	 either	 of	 these two	to	stand	and	salute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	the	status	of	the	flight	deck?”	he	asked,	though	by	the	state	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">observation	deck	he	believed	he	already	knew	the	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Badly	 damaged,”	 answered	 the	 man	 on	 the	 floor,	 wincing	 as	 the	 woman</p>
<p class="calibre1">tended	 to	 his	 wounded	 head.	 She	 was	 now	 making	 a	 clumsy	 effort	 to	 wrap	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">bandage	around	the	affected	area.	“There	is	no	hope	of	launching	fighters	until	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">receives	 some	 extensive	 repairs,	 and	 that	 won't	 be	 before	 we	 re-establish	 the forcefields.	The	whole	deck	has	been	exposed	to	space.	If	we	open	it	up,	then	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">risk	depressurising	the	entire	ship.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Survivors?	Anyone	still	alive	down	there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	a	chance.	If	they	weren't	killed	when	that	damn	fighter	hit,	then	they</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a>would	 have	 been	 spaced	 straight	 after.	 We'll	 have	 lost	 everyone:	 pilots, attendants,	the	OOD	and	the	junior,	technicians	and	munitions	handlers...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stay	calm,	man!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain!”	another	voice	came. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	looked	around	as	a	man	came	bounding	up	the	stairs	to	the	remains	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 observation	 room;	 it	 was	 the	 security	 officer	 who	 he	 had	 sent	 to	 fetch Andrea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 <i class="calibre4">Red	Devils</i>	are	dead,	sir.	They	were	spaced	during	the	frigate's	initial</p>

<p class="calibre1">Though	he	knew	the	shock	on	his	face	was	clear	for	all	to	see,	Parks	made</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	attempt	to	conceal	it.	This	was	news	that	he	had	not	been	prepared	for.	As	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">stood,	 the	 entire	 plan	 to	 attack	 and	 retake	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	 had	 been	 nothing	 short	 of	 a total	 disaster.	 Even	 retreating	 would	 not	 be	 possible	 until	 the	 engines	 were brought	back	on-line,	and	abandoning	the	ship	was	not	an	option.	The	evacuees</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	be	sitting	ducks	in	their	escape	pods.	Prisoners	would	not	be	taken,	lives</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	not	be	spared.	Even	without	full	shielding	or	weapon	systems,	they	stood</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	much	better	chance	of	survival	by	remaining	on	the	carrier	and	attempting	to</p>

<p class="calibre1">And	minutes	from	destruction	or	not,	Parks	would	 <i class="calibre4">never</i>	abandon	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Regaining	 some	 of	 his	 composure,	 the	 commodore	 felt	 his	 shock	 turn	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">anger	at	his	own	stupidity.	He	turned	to	the	man	and	woman	on	the	floor	next	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.	 “You	 two,	 once	 you	 are	 able,	 start	 organising	 an	 assessment	 of	 repairs needed	 to	 the	 flight	 deck.	 We	 must	 find	 a	 way	 to	 launch	 fighters.	 If	 we	 cannot get	 weapons	 systems	 or	 shielding	 back	 on-line	 then	 we	 will	 be	 totally</p>
<p class="calibre1">defenceless.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	once,	sir,”	the	man	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	 with	 me,”	 Parks	 said,	 looking	 at	 the	 bridge	 security	 officer.	 They</p>
<p class="calibre1">started	back	to	the	stairways	interconnecting	the	carrier's	decks.	“I	want	you	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">get	as	many	crew	members	as	possible	to	help	with	repairs,	skilled	in	that	field</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 not.	 The	 restoration	 of	 power	 to	 the	 engines,	 shields	 and	 weapon	 systems should	be	our	number	one	priority.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“In	 the	 meantime,	 we	 must	 find	 a	 way	 to	 defend	 ourselves,”	 Parks</p>
<p class="calibre1">continued.	“<i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>	and	 <i class="calibre4">Grendel's	Mother</i>	will	only	be	able	to	provide	cover for	 so	 long	 against	 a	 dedicated	 attack	 on	 us.

<p class="calibre1">He	found	himself	drawn	towards	it,	and	approached	to	run	his	hand	over	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">smooth	 curvature	 of	 the	 nose,	 his	 eyes	 wandering	 across	 every	 surface, </p>
<p class="calibre1">absorbing	 every	 detail.	 He	 found	 it	 beautiful,	 but	 knew	 that	 that	 beauty</p>
<p class="calibre1">concealed	the	fighter's	nature.	As	he	continued	to	gaze	upon	the	craft,	he	began</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	understand	how	Estelle	sometimes	felt,	striving	always	for	moments	like	this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 caught	 the	 dim	 reflection	 of	 Enrique	 in	 the	 fighter's	 armour.	 The	 man	 was standing	beside	him,	his	face	frozen	with	an	equal	look	of	reverence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 spacious	 cargo	 hold	 had	 been	 quite	 empty	 when	 the	 five	 starfighter</p>
<p class="calibre1">pilots	 had	 entered	 it,	 containing	 only	 the	 ATAFs	 and	 equipment	 necessary	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">handle	 them.	 It	 was	 now	 beginning	 to	 fill	 with	 other	 personnel,	 who	 had	 come streaming	 in	 to	 aid	 with	 the	 launch	 of	 the	 fighters.	 They	 buzzed	 around,	 for	 a time	ignoring	the	 <i class="calibre4">White	Knights</i>	and	concentrating	on	what	had	to	be	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 took	 little	 notice	 of	 them,	 hearing	 only	 their	 dim	 voices	 in	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">background.	One	was	speaking	to	Estelle. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep!	Fully	prepped	and	ready	to	go,	Lieutenant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,	 right...	 Dodds,	 Enrique,	 get	 over	 here,”	 she	 called	 to	 the	 men	 who</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	still	lost	in	their	admiration	of	the	craft	before	them.	There	was	the	sound</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 running	 feet,	 and	 she	 looked	 around	 to	 see	 an	 out	 of	 breath,	 red-faced	 man</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a>come	 sprinting	 into	 the	 cargo	 bay,	 almost	 knocking	 down	 several	 others	 in	 his haste. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Commodore	 Parks	 wants	 you	 to	 get	 these	 guys	 out	 there,	 ASAP!”	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">gasped	to	the	conning	officer.	“<i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	just	deployed	fighters	and	unless	we	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	 guys	 out	 there	 now...	 What	 the	 hell	 are	 those?”	 He	 was	 staring	 at	 the ATAFs	lining	the	walls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	loud	clunking	sound	and	the	occupants	of	the	cargo	hold	found</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves	 squinting	 against	 the	 glow	 of	 the	 carrier's	 restored	 lighting.	 Silence gave	 way	 to	 the	 sound	 of	 various	 pieces	 of	 machinery	 and	 computer	 system</p>
<p class="calibre1">starting	back	up.  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	had	come	alive	once	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	here's	the	plan,”	Estelle	said	as	her	wingmates	drew	around	her.	“I</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	takeoff	first,	to	get	an	overview	of	the	standings	and	liaise	with	Commodore</p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks.	Dodds,	I	want	you	out	next,	followed	by	Kelly,	Enrique,	and	then	Chaz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once	 we	 are	 out	 there,	 I	 will	 issue	 you	 all	 with	 objectives.”	 She	 looked	 to	 the ATAFs.	“Just...	just	remember	–	it's	like	flying	a	TAF.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	could	hear	her	voice	quivering	ever	so	slightly;	the	anticipation	of	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	to	come	was	causing	her	to	draw	breath	much	faster	than	usual.	She	turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	conning	officer.	“Ready?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ready,”	 she	 replied,	 signalling	 to	 others	 in	 the	 bay,	 who	 wheeled	 over	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">ladder	 so	 that	 Estelle	 could	 enter	 the	 cockpit.	 “Those	 special	 considerations	 I mentioned:	 we're	 not	 able	 to	 set	 up	 any	 sort	 of	 launch	 catapult	 down	 here,	 so you're	 going	 to	 have	 to	 maintain	 a	 hover	 whilst	 we	 rotate	 the	 inner	 and	 outer forcefields.	You	okay	with	that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No	problem,”	said	Estelle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 conning	 officer	 looked	 to	 the	 other	 four,	 who	 nodded	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">understanding.	 Then,	 to	 Estelle,	 she	 said,	 “Don't	 boost	 until	 you're	 fully	 clear, otherwise	you	could	cause	major	damage	to	the	hold.	Clear?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Understood,”	Estelle	said.	She	leapt	up	the	ladder,	scooped	up	the	helmet</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 was	 nestled	 into	 the	 seat	 and	 slipped	 it	 over	 her	 head.	 Despite	 the	 ATAF</p>
<p class="calibre1">evaluation	program	being	concluded	several	weeks	ago,	the	cockpit	layout	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	fresh	in	her	mind.	Her	fingers	pressed	buttons	and	flipped	switches	as	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	done	many	times	before,	the	starfighter's	systems	coming	on-line	just	as	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">expected.	As	the	last	notification	appeared,	Estelle	informed	the	flight	crew	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 was	 ready	 to	 go.	 She	 then	 took	 up	 the	 position	 the	 conning	 officer	 had requested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	could	feel	her	heart	beating	hard,	threatening	once	more	to	burst	out	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	chest;	though	now	out	of	sheer	exhilaration,	rather	than	fear	and	uncertainty. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">This	is	it,	girl.	This	is	what	it	has	all	been	about</i>,	she	thought	to	herself.  <i class="calibre4">Do</i> <i class="calibre4">yourself	proud.	Do	us	all	proud. </i>	 Looking	 to	 her	 side,	 she	 gave	 a	 thumbs-up	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a>her	 wingmates	 and	 then	 faced	 forward	 as	 the	 cargo	 bay	 doors	 slid	 apart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moments	later,	the	forcefield	rotated,	the	all-clear	was	given,	and	she	accelerated</p>
<p class="calibre1">out. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Beyond	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,	 the	 battle	 raged	 on.	 Though	  <i class="calibre4">Grendel's	 Mother</i>	 and	  <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i> were	struggling	against	the	increased	enemy	presence,	they	had	still	managed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">earn	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	a	reprieve.	After	seeing	the	damage	their	allied	carrier	had	sustained, and	 the	 loss	 of	 stability,	 Meyers	 and	 Mandeep	 had	 ordered	 all	 their	 crew	 and starfighters	 to	 divide	 themselves	 between	 protecting	 all	 three	 carriers.	 Against the	odds,	their	efforts	were	admirable,	but	cracks	were	beginning	to	show	in	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">defence,	the	increasing	swarm	of	enemy	fighters	on	the	verge	of	overcoming	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">allied	 forces.  <i class="calibre4">Grendel's	 Mother</i>	 had	 held	 her	 position	 next	 to	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,	 Meyers taking	 <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>	to	stand	some	way	in	front	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You're	going	to	have	to	work	harder	to	keep	those	fighters	off	us,”	Meyers</p>
<p class="calibre1">told	the	allied	squadrons.	“If	they	put	either	 <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>	or	 <i class="calibre4">Grendel's	Mother</i>	 out of	commission,	then	it's	all	over.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doing	our	best,	captain,”	one	of	the	pilots	responded.	“But	these	guys	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">proving	 tougher	 than	 expected.	 I've	 never	 seen	 Imperial	 pilots	 fly	 like	 this before!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	because	Imperial	pilots	 <i class="calibre4">don't</i>	 fly	 like	 that!”	 another	 pilot	 broadcast his	feelings	to	the	entire	field,	the	anxiety	unmistakable	in	his	voice.	“I've	flown</p>
<p class="calibre1">against	them	before,	and	these	guys...	these	guys	are	something	else!	Those	are</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">not</i>	Imperial	pilots	in	those	fighters!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	the	same	concerns	that	Meyers	had	heard	levied	by	many	others</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	 the	 field.	 The	 skills	 possessed	 by	 those	 commanding	 the	 Imperial</p>
<p class="calibre1">starfighters	was	truly	something	to	behold:	it	was	as	though	they	were	more	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">capable	of	exploiting	every	weakness	of	their	opponents,	whilst	at	the	same	time</p>
<p class="calibre1">able	 to	 anticipate	 and	 compensate	 for	 every	 return	 attack.	 Their	 reactions	 were unparalleled,	 as	 if	 they	 had	 minutes	 to	 deal	 with	 situations	 that	 others	 were required	to	handle	in	seconds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain,	 power	 has	 been	 restored	 to	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,”	 came	 a	 voice	 from	 the bridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meyers	 turned	 from	 where	 he	 had	 been	 watching	 a	 pair	 of	 TAFs'	 luckless</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempts	 at	 taking	 down	 an	 Imperial	 fighter,	 to	 see	 that	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	 was	 once	 again back	on-line.	He	was	relieved	to	see	that	the	enemy	fighter	that	had	crashed	into</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a>its	flight	deck	had	not	left	the	carrier	permanently	dead	in	the	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	God	for	that.”	He	turned	to	his	communications	officer.	“Have	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">managed	to	establish	contact	with	Commodore	Parks	yet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Negative,	sir,”	the	woman	answered.	“There	is	too	much	signal	corruption</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	maintain	a	stable	connection.	The	link	keeps	dropping	out	every	few	seconds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their	comms	system	must	still	be	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Keep	 trying,”	 Meyers	 said,	 staring	 at	 the	 swarm	 of	 Imperial	 starfighters</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	had	just	issued	from	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>.	Against	such	odds,	they	would	need	some	sort</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	miracle	to	see	them	through	to	the	end	of	the	day. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	were	clear	of	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,	and	the	ATAFs	looped	around	the	rear	of	the carrier,	 to	 face	 the	 incoming	 threat.	 Dodds	 realised	 that	 the	 situation	 they	 now faced	mirrored	one	from	the	many	hours	they	had	all	put	into	the	simulators.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">reminded	 him	 of	 the	 team's	 very	 first	 failure	 and	 of	 how	 the	 training	 manager had	 assured	 them	 it	 had	 been	 designed	 to	 be	 unfair,	 unrealistic,	 and	 not	 ever likely	to	occur	in	real	life.	With	all	that	in	mind,	he	approached	the	battle	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">added	caution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle's	 orders	 -	 derived	 from	 what	 she	 had	 managed	 to	 understand	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks,	 between	 the	 static	 and	 regular	 loss	 of	 signal	 –	 further	 compounded	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	to	lend	support	to	the	three	carriers	that	were	attempting	to	escape	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">system,	 providing	 extra	 support	 to	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	 in	 its	 crippled	 state.	 Parks	 had	 also requested	that	they	attempt	to	take	down	the	frigate	at	the	earliest	opportunity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“...	 though	 it	 looks	 like	 we're	 going	 to	 have	 to	 fight	 our	 way	 through	 this lot,	first,”	Estelle	concluded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	noted	that	whilst	some	of	the	fighters	that	had	departed	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">peeled	off	from	the	main	group	and	were	headed	in	the	direction	of	 <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 majority	 were	 headed	 straight	 towards	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	 and	  <i class="calibre4">Grendel's	 Mother</i>;	 and with	them,	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>.	Dodds	swallowed	and	then	braced	himself.	Along	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 wingmates,	 he	 put	 himself	 on	 an	 intercept	 course	 with	 the	 approaching</p>
<p class="calibre1">squadron	and	sped	towards	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 they	 drew	 within	 range	 of	 one	 another,	 both	 sides	 spread	 out	 to	 gain</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	 fighting	 room,	 three	 of	 the	 Imperial	 fighters	 aligning	 themselves	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds.	 He	 eyed	 his	 opponents.	 Though	 he	 had	 never	 seen	 them	 outside	 of	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">simulated	environment,	there	was	no	mistaking	the	form	of	an	Imperial	Mantis:</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	Y-shaped	frame	and	egg-like	body,	where	the	cockpit	and	single	large	engine</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a>resided.	Three	struts	jutted	out	of	the	body,	a	single	cannon	affixed	to	the	tips	of the	 frame's	 top	 two;	 the	 lower,	 central	 one,	 home	 to	 a	 number	 of	 missiles,	 set into	 a	 rack.	 Though	 not	 visible	 from	 the	 distance,	 Dodds	 recalled	 that	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fighter's	 designers	 had	 also	 seen	 fit	 to	 squeeze	 on	 another	 pair	 of	 guns,	 just beneath	 the	 main	 body.	 The	 appendages	 appeared	 almost	 as	 if	 they	 were	 claws and	 mandibles,	 poised	 to	 rip	 their	 opponent	 apart;	 the	 maroon	 hues	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Imperial	colour	schemes	that	decorated	the	armour	looking	like	the	blood	of	its</p>
<p class="calibre1">previous	victims. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	three	fighters	continued	to	close	in	on	him	and	Dodds	held	his	course</p>
<p class="calibre1">unwavering,	 making	 no	 indication	 that	 he	 intended	 to	 deviate	 from	 his	 present course.	He	kept	in	mind	his	experiences	of	the	ATAF	back	on	Xalan,	confident</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 the	 fighter	 he	 occupied	 was	 in	 every	 way	 superior	 to	 those	 he	 faced,	 no matter	the	odds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weapons	ranges	were	met,	and	at	once	the	three	Mantises'	guns	opened	up, </p>
<p class="calibre1">a	torrent	of	green	and	purple	bolts	streaking	towards	him.	At	the	sight,	he	felt	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart	 leap	 into	 his	 throat,	 panic	 deriding	 the	 pride	 he	 had	 felt	 only	 moments earlier.	He	banked	hard	to	evade	the	shower,	though	not	as	fast	as	he	would	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">liked.	Much	of	the	enemy	fire	hit	home,	his	fighter's	encasing	shields	bathing	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">entire	cockpit	in	rippling	blue	hues	as	they	absorbed	the	hits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 the	 Mantises	 streaked	 past,	 Dodds'	 hand	 flew	 to	 the	 ejection	 handle, </p>
<p class="calibre1">preparing	 to	 blow	 the	 canopy	 and	 jettison	 himself	 out	 of	 the	 doomed	 craft,	 the moment	 he	 heard	 the	 blare	 of	 the	 warning	 siren.	 It	 never	 came,	 and	 all	 was silent,	save	for	the	jumble	of	noise	from	his	comms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Relief	washed	over	him	as	he	glanced	to	the	instrument	panel.	The	attack	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 feared	 had	 barely	 even	 registered.	 It	 was	 like	 the	 first	 day	 with	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">simulators	all	over	again,	where	he	had	found	it	difficult	to	get	used	to	the	fact</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	the	ATAF	could	handle	itself	far	better	in	combat	than	anything	else	he	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever	flown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 exhaled,	 though	 his	 heart	 was	 still	 beating	 hard.	 He	 then	 wheeled	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ATAF	around	and	gave	chase	to	the	three	Imperial	fighters	that	had	just	passed</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 the	 realisation	 that	 their	 target	 had	 been	 spared	 destruction	 and	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	tailing	them,	the	Mantis	group	dived.	Dodds	stayed	behind	them	during	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">manoeuvre	and	the	ones	that	they	followed	up	with,	utilizing	all	the	skills	he	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	taught.	He	then	shifted	his	heading	over,	so	that	his	crosshairs	met	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">HUD's	predictive	targeting	receptacle,	before	returning	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 far	 from	 the	 first	 time	 he	 had	 seen	 it,	 but	 the	 resulting	 hail	 of	 fire from	 the	 ATAF's	 cannons	 still	 floored	 him;	 even	 more	 so	 when	 his	 target</p>
<p class="calibre1">connected	with	the	thick	stream	of	plasma	bolts.	The	Mantis	exploded,	scattering</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a>metals,	alloys,	and	sparking	components	in	every	direction.	Dodds	was	quick	to react	 to	 its	 allies,	 who	 were	 pulling	 away,	 repeating	 the	 same	 tried	 and	 tested technique	against	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thirty	 seconds	 later,	 Dodds	 found	 himself	 victorious,	 staring	 at	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tumbling	 remnants	 of	 an	 enemy	 that	 had	 at	 first	 outnumbered	 and	 outgunned</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.	A	small	chuckle	of	disbelief	escaped	him,	and	he	turned	about	to	face	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ongoing	struggle	he	had	lost	sight	of	during	his	fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	eyes	swept	 across	the	scene:	 cannon	fire,	lasers,	 missiles,	and	fighters</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 various	 different	 configurations	 flew	 in	 every	 direction.  <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>'s	 and <i class="calibre4">Grendel's	 Mother</i>'s	 cannons	 were	 hunting	 targets	 within	 the	 hordes	 of	 Imperial fighters	 that	 were	 swarming	 all	 about	 them.	 At	 one	 time	 a	 sight	 such	 as	 this might	have	terrified	him;	made	him	wish	that	he	was	some	place	else.	Not	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	for	the	W-shaped	forms	of	the	other	four	ATAFs	in	amongst	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">swashes	of	other	fighters,	then	gave	up.	He	would	find	him	them	later.	For	now, </p>
<p class="calibre1">there	were	bigger	issues	to	address.	He	could	see	more	Imperial	fighters	turning</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	way.	He	suspended	his	disbelief,	buried	his	sense	of	glory,	and	took	a	good</p>
<p class="calibre1">grip	on	the	stick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,	 let's	 see	 what	 this	 thing	 can	 really	 do.”	 He	 raised	 his	 velocity	 to maximum	and	dove	headlong	into	the	chaos. </p>

<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">With	 power	 restored	 to	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,	 Parks	 was	 once	 again	 able	 to	 immerse	 himself back	into	the	battle.	For	all	the	damage	the	carrier	had	incurred,	he	was	surprised</p>
<p class="calibre1">–	 and	 grateful	 –	 to	 discover	 that	 the	 on-board	 camera	 systems	 and	 audio</p>
<p class="calibre1">transmissions	had	been	least	affected.	As	the	feeds	tracked	the	ATAFs	speeding</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	 the	 conflict	 zone,	 he	 caught	 snatches	 of	 reaction	 from	 other	 allied</p>
<p class="calibre1">fighters,	 whilst	 the	 bridge	 crew	 attempted	 to	 establish	 a	 more	 stable	 comms</p>
<p class="calibre1">system. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who	the	hell	are	 <i class="calibre4">they</i>?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	know,	I've	never	seen	them	before!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	they	on	our	side?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	know	-	there's	no	markings	on	them!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Should	we	attack?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No!	They're	not	shooting	at	 <i class="calibre4">us</i>;	they're	shooting	at	 <i class="calibre4">them</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	 what	 Parks	 could	 tell,	 the	 Enemy	 forces	 had	 ceased	 many	 of	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">attacks	on	the	allies	present,	concentrating	all	their	efforts	on	attempting	to	bring</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a>down	 the	 five	 unknown	 starfighters	 that	 were	 tearing	 their	 way	 through	 their forces.	Although,	for	all	their	might,	they	may	as	well	have	been	trying	to	hold</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	the	tide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain,	we've	managed	to	establish	a	stable	connection	with	 <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	heard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Audio?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Both	audio	and	visual,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Finally,”	he	said	and	turned	away	from	where	he	had	been	watching	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	ATAF's	astral	acrobatics.	“Bring	it	up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 holographic	 image	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>'s	 captain	 was	 far	 from	 perfect.	 Even under	 normal	 operation	 the	 image	 and	 audio	 could	 suffer	 from	 breakup	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">distortions,	 as	 the	 signal	 failed	 in	 places.	 It	 was	 now	 a	 permanent	 mess	 of discolouration	and	blocky	pixels,	the	audio	scratchy	and	accompanied	by	white</p>
<p class="calibre1">noise.	But	it	represented	the	best	efforts	of	the	crew	in	the	time	given	to	them, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and,	for	now,	fulfilled	its	purpose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	are	you	holding	up,	Aiden?”	Parks	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Better	than	you,	by	the	looks	of	things,	Elliott.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	picked	at	some	of	the	blood	caked	to	his	face.	Aside	from	a	handful</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	painkillers,	he	had	refused	any	proper	medical	attention	once	he	had	learned</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	was	suffering	from	nothing	more	than	a	superficial	head	wound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meyer	 said,	 “I	 requested	 that	 Commodore	 Hawke	 bring	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	 up	 front	 to lend	 their	 support	 for	 our	 withdrawal,	 but	 I'm	 sorry	 to	 say	 that	 he	 point-blank refused.	I	did	my	best,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 waved	 away	 the	 man's	 apology.	 He	 had	 long	 since	 given	 up</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempting	 to	 involve	 Hawke	 in	 the	 battle,	 communication	 problems</p>

<p class="calibre1">Meyers'	attention	turned	for	a	moment	and	he	looked	back	at	Parks.	“I	see</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	managed	to	deploy	the	ATAFs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Eventually.	And	by	all	accounts	they	are	exceeding	expectations.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	are	the	 <i class="calibre4">Red	Devils</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	shook	his	head.	“The	 <i class="calibre4">Red	Devils</i>	aren't	piloting	the	ATAFs,	Captain, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	  <i class="calibre4">White	 Knights</i>	 are.	 Unfortunately,	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Red	 Devils</i>	 lost	 their	 lives	 when	 the frigate	attacks	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hell,	that's...	regrettable,”	Meyers	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although	Parks	felt	the	same	way,	there	was	no	time	for	anyone	to	grieve. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a>“Captain,	I	want	 <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>	to	fall	back	to	my	position,	so	that	we	can	complete our	 withdrawal.

<p class="calibre1">“The	frigate	 <i class="calibre4">and</i>	the	fighters?”	Meyers	said,	looking	stunned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	raised	a	hand.	“Don't	worry,	Captain,	they	can	cope.	This	is	an	ideal</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Very	 well,	 Commodore,”	 Meyers	 said.	 “I	 will	 prep	 torpedoes	 in	 case</p>

<p class="calibre1">With	 Kelly's	 lead,	 the	 three	 tackled	 their	 target	 in	 a	 similar	 manner	 to	 the way	they	had	done	time	and	time	again	on	Xalan:	starting	with	their	lasers,	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">circled	the	vessel	until	the	biting	red	beams	had	made	significant	impacts	on	its</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Already?”	Dodds	said	in	disbelief.	He	could	have	put	full	trust	in	his	radar, </p>

<p class="calibre1">was	torn	asunder	by	the	explosions	that	continued	to	issue	forth.	He	lingered	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	while,	aware	of	the	fire	striking	him,	but	paying	it	no	more	attention	than	he</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p181"></a>Estelle's	voice	dragged	him	back.	“We	need	to	hurry	up,	Dodds.	These	guys won't	 be	 able	 to	 handle	 the	 fighters	 themselves	 and	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	 is	 in	 trouble	 if	 that frigate	gets	any	closer.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 adjusted	 his	 heading	 to	 pass	 over	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	 and	 onward	 to	 meet	 the approaching	frigate.	As	he	drew	closer,	he	concluded	that	the	quickest	solution</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 the	 problem	 of	 the	 frigate	 was	 to	 employ	 the	 use	 of	 his	 fighter's	 plasma accelerator.	 Having	 only	 used	 the	 weapon	 during	 the	 first	 few	 days	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ATAF's	simulated	courses,	a	real	world	test	was	long	overdue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Traversing	 the	 craft's	 system	 menus,	 he	 located	 the	 screen	 he	 needed	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">activate	 the	 weapon,	 only	 to	 be	 confronted	 with	 an	 access	 denial.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">nevertheless	tapped	the	screen	a	few	times	in	defiance.	The	console	did	nothing, </p>

<p class="calibre1">“My	 accelerator	 has	 been	 locked,”	 Dodds	 said.	 “If	 yours	 isn't	 working</p>

<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 returned	 his	 full	 attention	 back	 towards	 their	 target,	 discovering	 the</p>

<p class="calibre1">A	 jump	 point	 formed	 beyond,	 and	 the	 battleship,	 along	 with	 the	 enormous</p>

<p class="calibre1">Parks	 noted	 that	 some	 of	 the	 Imperial	 fighters	 had	 not	 made	 it	 into	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">vicinity	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	 before	 it	 had	 departed	 the	 system.	 Unable	 to	 jump	 out	 of Aster,	the	orphaned	craft	now	looked	to	be	stranded,	and	for	a	time	they	milled</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	in	the	area	once	occupied	by	their	allies.	All	of	a	sudden,	they	changed</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p183"></a>Parks	spun	from	the	video	relay	to	the	frontal	viewport,	where	even	without the	feeds,	the	fading	burst	was	quite	visible.	A	ripple	of	shock	ran	the	length	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 bridge,	 gasps	 and	 curses	 filling	 the	 air.	 Shouts	 and	 cries	 exploded	 from	 the various	 feeds	 and	 the	 other	 bridges,	 all	 intermixed	 and	 indistinguishable,	 and none	providing	the	one	answer	Parks	needed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">the	 dozen	 or	 so	 Imperial	 fighters	 that	 were	 speeding	 towards	 them.	 In	 the	 end, one	 of	 the	 craft	 had	 ploughed	 straight	 into	 them.	 For	 everything	 that	 had</p>

<p class="calibre1">Kelly	 blinked	 her	 eyes	 open	 and	 tried	 to	 clear	 her	 blurred	 vision.	 There	 was	 a jumble	 of	 noise	 in	 her	 head.	 It	 sounded	 like	 voices	 calling	 out	 to	 her	 and demanding	 attention.	 After	 sometime,	 she	 realised	 it	 was	 her	 craft	 that	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">spinning	and	not	her	head,	and	with	considerable	effort	she	managed	to	slow	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">halt	the	spin	of	the	fighter,	bringing	it	to	a	complete	stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p184"></a>Closing	her	eyes,	she	concentrated	on	her	breathing,	calming	herself	so	that she	did	not	do	the	unthinkable	and	vomit	inside	her	helmet.	What	was	going	on? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where	was	she?	In	a	cockpit,	to	be	sure.	The	act	of	slowing	the	fighter	had	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhat	instinctual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	opened	her	eyes	once	more	and	looked	all	about	the	cockpit,	then	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">nebulas	that	hung	nearby.	A	forest	of	spinning	metals	floated	in	every	direction</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	eye	could	see.	What	looked	like	the	broken,	burnt,	and	scorched	hull	of	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">unknown	large	vessel	tumbled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kelly,	are	you	okay?”	a	dim	voice	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	seemed	to	come	from	all	around	her.	She	winced	against	a	dull	ache	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	left	side	of	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kelly?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where	are	you?	What's	going	on?”	she	said	to	the	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	hit	an	Imperial	fighter,”	the	voice	said.	“It	flew	straight	into	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	did?”	Kelly	said.	She	found	that	hard	to	believe.	If	the	voice	was	telling</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	truth,	shouldn't	she	be	dead?	Maybe	she	was? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Kelly,	are	you	okay?”	the	voice	said	again.	“Is	anything	broken?	Are	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">bleeding	anywhere?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Enrique,	 give	 her	 a	 moment,”	 another	 voice	 cut	 in.	 “It's	 obvious	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1">doesn't	remember	what	just	happened.	Kelly,	it's	Chaz.	You've	just	had	a	crash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don't	 panic,	 just	 stay	 calm;	 ignore	 everyone	 and	 take	 your	 time.	 We're	 right here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 a	 time	 the	 voices	 stopped	 and	 Kelly's	 memory	 gradually	 began	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">rebuild	 itself	 as	 she	 looked	 about	 the	 cockpit	 and	 at	 the	 scene	 outside.	 She started	to	recall	the	events	that	had	led	up	to	her	current	situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes...	 yes...	 I'm	 okay,”	 she	 said,	 several	 minutes	 later.	 “I	 just	 can't</p>
<p class="calibre1">remember	very	much	about	what	happened.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sounds	like	you	might	be	suffering	from	a	concussion,”	Chaz	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly	reached	up	to	touch	the	side	of	her	head,	before	her	hand	encountered</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 helmet	 she	 wore.	 Even	 so,	 she	 rubbed	 around	 the	 area	 where	 her	 head	 was aching.	 She	 must	 have	 struck	 her	 head	 hard	 against	 the	 canopy.	 That	 would</p>
<p class="calibre1">explain	 the	 blackout.	 She	 still	 felt	 quite	 dizzy,	 but	 at	 least	 the	 sick	 feeling	 was passing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How's	the	ATAF?”	Enrique	said.	“Are	you	good	to	fly	it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	I	think	so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	badly	is	it	damaged?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	pulled	herself	together	and	looked	at	her	read-outs.	She	squinted	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">displays,	 sceptical	 of	 the	 numbers	 she	 was	 reading	 and	 the	 images	 she	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">looking	at,	thinking	the	blow	to	her	head	might	be	causing	her	to	see	things. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p185"></a>“It's	not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">At	all? </i>”	Enrique	said,	sounding	surprised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No.”	she	said.	She	might	have	been	surprised	if	she	had	not	been	feeling</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	groggy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	 report	 was	 relayed	 to	 Parks,	 who	 started	 to	 wonder	 how	 many	 other</p>
<p class="calibre1">surprises	the	day	had	in	store	for	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She's	 <i class="calibre4">alive</i>?”	Liu	said.	“After	 <i class="calibre4">that</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	nodded	to	the	helmsman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By	 all	 rights	 that	 fighter	 should	 have	 been	 destroyed	 and	 she	 should	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">dead!	That's	incredible!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">It's	more	than	that</i>,	Parks	thought.  <i class="calibre4">It	may	well	represent	our	only	hope</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 the	 departure	 of	 the	 enemy	 forces	 and	 the	 silence	 of	 weaponry,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">scene	 beyond	 the	 bridge	 had	 become	 still	 once	 more.	 But	 amongst	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">multicoloured	 splendour	 of	 their	 surroundings	 lay	 the	 remnants	 of	 a	 battle	 that had	 not	 been	 easily	 won.	 With	 the	 operation	 over,	 Parks	 found	 himself	 able	 to slow	down	and	take	in	everything	about	him.	He	turned	around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bridge	had	been	laid	to	waste;	and	whilst	his	crew	were	coping	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">damage	that	had	been	dealt	it,  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	would	without	doubt	be	out	of	service	for several	weeks,	if	not	months.	It	was	not	time	they	could	spare. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Idiot, </i>	he	thought	to	himself,	looking	over	how	much	the	carrier	had	suffered</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	the	hands	of	an	enemy	he	had	been	foolish	enough	to	believe	he	was	ready	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">tackle.  <i class="calibre4">We're	not	ready	yet! </i> You <i class="calibre4">	are	not	ready! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>'s	condition	was	not	much	better,	the	damage	to	the	exterior	quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">clear	from	where	Parks	stood.	The	emblems	of	the	mythical	creature	that	graced</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 hull	 were	 torn	 and	 burnt	 from	 where	 missiles,	 plasma	 bolts,	 and	 lasers	 had scorched	 the	 armour.	 Small	 glistening	 crystalline	 shapes	 could	 be	 seen</p>
<p class="calibre1">emanating	from	damaged	areas,	where	leaking	gases	and	chemicals	froze	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">cold.	 Loose	 metals	 and	 alloys	 threatened	 to	 break	 off	 at	 the	 merest	 brush	 with solar	 winds.  <i class="calibre4">Grendel's	 Mother</i>	 told	 a	 similar	 story,	 the	 carrier	 in	 no	 better condition	for	her	part	in	the	battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	 then	 there	 was	 the	 loss	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Grendel</i>.	 The	 destruction	 of	 one	 of	 their carriers	 would	 not	 please	 the	 United	 Naval	 Forces,	 who	 had	 agreed	 to	 support the	 Confederation	 in	 their	 endeavour	 on	 the	 condition	 that	 the	 safety	 of	 their forces	 would	 be	 made	 a	 top	 priority.	 Parks	 had	 a	 lot	 to	 answer	 for,	 though	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p186"></a>realised	it	could	have	been	a	lot	worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	 job,	 everyone,”	 Parks	 said	 to	 the	 bridge	 crew,	 although	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">congratulatory	 offering	 felt	 decidedly	 hollow.	 “Now	 that	 we	 have	 time	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">breathe,	please	prioritise	yourselves	with	seeing	to	the	wounded	and	dealing	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">repairs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 would	 call	 a	 meeting	 of	 his	 senior	 staff	 after	 he'd	 had	 time	 to	 see	 to other	matters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr	Liu,	please	put	me	in	touch	with	 <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>,  <i class="calibre4">Grendel's	Mother</i>,	 and...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">he	started,	before	a	sudden	anger	gripped	him.	“No,	wait,	disregard	that.	Put	me</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	touch	with	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>,	alone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	waited	for	the	link	to	establish,	he	tried	to	cool	his	anger	by	counting</p>
<p class="calibre1">slowly	to	ten.	He	made	it	to	three. </p>

<p class="calibre1">—	<b class="calibre3">The	Journey	Home	—</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“<b class="calibre3">T</b>hank	 you	 so	 much	 for	 your	 assistance,	 Commodore,”	 Parks	 began.	 “We</p>
<p class="calibre1">certainly	 would	 not	 have	 been	 able	 to	 cope	 without	 your	 timely	 intervention.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 made	 no	 attempt	 to	 conceal	 the	 sarcasm	 in	 his	 voice,	 the	 man	 sure	 that, even	if	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>'s	captain	had	somehow	failed	to	detect	it,	his	expression	would	do	an adequate	job	of	conveying	his	dissatisfaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawke's	expression	in	the	holographic	screen	remained	quite	neutral	as	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">composed	 himself	 before	 replying.	 “As	 we	 had	 both	 agreed	 prior	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">commencement	 of	 the	 operation,	 Commodore,	 I	 took	 up	 the	 position	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">rearguard	and	moved	in	to	fulfil	my	role	as	needed.	I	stand	by	my	belief	that	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	acted	sooner	than	was	necessary,	we	would,	without	a	shadow	of	a	doubt,	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 surrounded	 by	 enemy	 forces	 and	 certainly	 would	 not	 be	 having	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1">conversation	now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 is	 beside	 the	 point,	 Commodore!”	 Parks	 glared.	 “I	 gave	 you	 a	 very</p>
<p class="calibre1">specific	request	that	our	forces	were	being	overrun	and	we	needed	your	support. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	chose	to	ignore	that	request.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	did	no	such	thing.	Your	communication	was	cut	short	and	I	took	it	upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">myself	to	hold	position	until	I	could	make	a	better	assessment	of	the	situation,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawke	replied	with	the	same	air	of	infallibility. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Your	 stubbornness	 and	 downright	 arrogance	 is	 staggering</i>,	 Parks	 thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">What	the	hell	happened	to	you? </i>	It	was	almost	as	if	the	man	didn't	 <i class="calibre4">want</i>	to	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had	Hawke	panicked	in	the	face	of	the	Enemy?	Had	a	repressed	memory	of	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">experience	 aboard	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	 during	 the	 time	 of	 its	 theft	 reared	 its	 ugly	 head? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever	it	was,	it	was	still	unacceptable	to	stand	idly	by	as	hostile	forces	tore</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	allies	apart,	and	for	that	Parks	was	infuriated.	With	all	that	had	happened	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">day	he	felt	the	rage	building	within	him	and	decided	to	end	the	discussion	rather</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	make	his	feelings	known	to	the	entire	bridge	crew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	will	continue	this	later,	during	debriefing,”	Parks	said,	fully	intent	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">bringing	 the	 man's	 almost	 total	 lack	 of	 participation	 in	 the	 operation	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p188"></a>attention	of	Fleet	Admiral	Turner	and	other	members	of	naval	high	command. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 signalled	 to	 the	 bridge	 crew	 to	 open	 communications	 to	  <i class="calibre4">Grendel's</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Mother</i>	 and	  <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>.	 The	 holographic	 images	 of	 Mandeep	 and	 Meyers appeared	 alongside	 the	 already	 present	 image	 of	 Hawke,	 the	 quality	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">images	as	poor	as	ever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Commodore,	 Captain,”	 Parks	 greeted	 them.	 “Are	 you	 in	 any	 need	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">assistance?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	will	be	fine	for	the	return	journey,	thank	you,	Commodore,”	Mandeep</p>
<p class="calibre1">replied,	the	smile	that	Parks	had	grown	so	accustomed	to	and	fond	of	no	longer</p>
<p class="calibre1">gracing	 her	 face.	 “Much	 of	 the	 damage	 we	 received	 was	 superficial,	 a	 miracle given	 what	 we	 just	 faced.”	 Mandeep	 looked	 sad	 and	 disappointed,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tremendous	 losses	 they	 had	 suffered	 and	 the	 deaths	 of	 her	 colleagues</p>
<p class="calibre1">undoubtedly	an	enormous	weight	on	her	mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Likewise	 with	  <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>,”	 Meyers	 said.	 “We	 did	 take	 some	 considerable damage,	but	it's	nothing	that	we	cannot	cope	with	prior	to	our	return	to	Spirit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	nodded	in	understanding.	“Very	well.	Whilst	going	about	the	repairs</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	should	perform	a	brief	sweep	of	the	area	and	pick	up	any	bodies	we	can	find. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obviously	there	is	nothing	we	can	do	for	those	poor	individuals,	but	we	can	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">least	return	their	bodies	home	for	a	decent	burial.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 eyes	 flickered	 past	 the	 holographic	 images	 to	 the	 debris	 that	 floated</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	 beyond	 the	 carrier.	 Many	 of	 the	 starfighter	 pilots	 that	 had	 lost	 their	 lives would	have	been	all	but	vaporised	in	the	explosions	of	their	craft.	This	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">glad	for.	After	everything	that	had	happened,	too	many	questions	would	be	asked</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	they	pulled	in	the	body	of	one	of	the	Enemy.	Such	an	occurrence	would	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">act	as	a	catalyst	and	foundation	for	increasing	rumour	and	speculation.	A	count</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	name-check	of	those	returning	on	the	carriers	would	be	performed	at	Spirit, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with	those	unaccounted	for	being	marked	as	killed	in	action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 that	 in	 mind,	 he	 looked	 to	 Meyers.	 “Captain,	 can	  <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>	 carry some	of	our	fighters?	Our	flight	deck	is	too	badly	damaged	to	land	any	and	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	only	accommodate	so	many	in	our	cargo	holds.	I	don't	expect	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	will	have room	to	spare,”	he	added	dryly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meyers	 nodded.	 “That	 shouldn't	 be	 an	 issue	 since,	 regrettably,	 we	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">many	empty	bays.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	Captain,”	Parks	said,	before	he	turned	once	again	to	Mandeep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please	convey	my	sincere	condolences	to	the	families	of	those	who	were	aboard</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Grendel</i>.	A	lot	of	brave	men	and	women	lost	their	lives	on	that	ship	today.”	To</p>
<p class="calibre1">lose	an	entire	carrier	was	disastrous	to	any	naval	force.	Matters	were	made	worse</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 the	 fact	 that	 the	 crew	 were	 made	 up	 of	 military	 personnel	 volunteered	 by	 a number	of	Independent	World	naval	forces.	Parks	could	almost	hear	the	cracks</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p189"></a>widening	in	the	already	strained	relationships	between	some	of	the	worlds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	will	make	sure	your	sympathies	are	known,	Commodore,”	Mandeep	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 sadness	 clear	 in	 her	 eyes	 even	 through	 the	 distortion.	 “Please	 contact	 us when	you	are	ready	to	leave.	We	will	wait	with	you	here,	in	case	we	can	provide</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	further	assistance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you	again,	Sima,”	Parks	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse	me,	Commodore,	but	how	do	you	suppose	the	enemy	forces	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">able	to	override	the	shutdown	code	that	was	sent	to	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>?”	Meyers	asked.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 a	 question	 that	 had	 played	 on	 Parks'	 mind	 -	 and	 he	 suspected	 very	 many others	-	throughout	the	course	of	the	battle.	The	sudden	restoration	of	power	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	had	tipped	the	scales	well	in	the	enemy's	favour	during	the	opening	part of	the	operation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	believe	they	did,	Captain,”	Parks	answered.	“Our	initial	attempt	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">transmitting	the	code	was	not	immediately	successful	and	it	took	a	lot	longer	for</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>'s	systems	to	be	deactivated	than	I	was	led	to	believe.	I	was	informed	that the	shutdown	procedure	would	take	place	upon	receipt	of	the	code.	The	fact	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	 did	 not	 do	 so	 should	 have	 been	 our	 first	 warning.	 It	 is	 my	 belief	 that	 the Enemy	 became	 aware	 our	 intentions	 and	 purposely	 shut	 down	 all	 systems</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves	 in	 compliance.	 Once	 we	 were	 lured	 into	 a	 false	 sense	 of	 security, they	sprung	their	trap.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	could	they	have	known	about	something	like	that?”	Mandeep	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	had	a	hunch	that	she	was	asking	a	rhetorical	question,	implying	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Enemy	had	either	been	tipped	off	ahead	of	their	encounter	or	that	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>'s</p>
<p class="calibre1">previous	crew	were	now	working	alongside	its	new	owners. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	 afraid	 I	 don't	 know	 the	 answer	 to	 that,	 Commodore,”	 he	 said.	 “Until</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	can	collate	a	battle	report	and	analyse	all	the	data,	then	my	guess	would	be	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	as	yours.	Once	we	have	further	information	I	will	ensure	that	it	is	shared</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	IWC. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now,	if	there	is	no	other	business	that	anyone	wishes	to	discuss?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	 with	 the	 interference	 caused	 by	 the	 damage	 to	 the	 holographic</p>
<p class="calibre1">projection	 systems,	 Parks	 had	 no	 trouble	 making	 out	 the	 subtle	 confrontational look	that	Hawke	was	giving	him.	There	were	shakes	of	heads	and	answers	of	no. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	we	will	make	preparations	to	leave.	I	will	be	in	contact	shortly.” </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Negative,	Lieutenant.	I	want	you	and	your	team	to	return	to	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,”	Parks</p>
<p class="calibre1">answered	her.	“Land	via	the	rear	cargo	bay	and	then	await	further	instructions.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Acknowledged.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	 was	 the	 first	 to	 return	 to	 the	 rear	 cargo	 bay,	 the	 awaiting	 crew</p>

<p class="calibre1">to	join	them.	“Think	I	might	have	gotten	one	or	two	more	than	you,	though!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 think	 you'll	 find	 I	 was	 ahead	 of	 you	 the	 whole	 the	 time,”	 Enrique	 said, with	a	chuckle.	He	shook	Dodds'	hand	and	they	gave	each	other	a	hearty	slap	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	frigate	still	only	counts	as	one,”	Dodds	grinned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 am	 glad	 to	 be	 out	 there,	 though,”	 Enrique	 said,	 nodding	 towards	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ATAFs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Definitely.	After	all	of	that	I	could	do	with	a	nap,”	Dodds	admitted.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	 to	 Chaz,	 who	 was	 making	 his	 way	 over	 to	 them.	 He	 appeared	 quite</p>
<p class="calibre1">upbeat	for	a	change,	a	smile	on	his	face.	With	Kelly	the	last	to	land	and	now	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	her	ATAF,	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	gathered	around	Estelle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	 work	 out	 there,	 everyone,”	 she	 beamed,	 looking	 happier	 than	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	done	in	weeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	think	those	Imperial	pilots	knew	what	hit	them,”	Dodds	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	 not	 sure	 anyone	 out	 there	 did	 either,	 to	 tell	 the	 truth,”	 Enrique	 said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Those	fighters	are	still	supposed	to	be	a	military	secret.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Test	 run,”	 Chaz	 said,	 glancing	 back	 around	 at	 the	 fighters,	 which	 still</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	as	fresh	and	new	as	the	day	they	had	completed	construction.	There	didn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">appear	 to	 be	 one	 dent	 or	 scratch	 on	 any	 of	 them.	 Not	 even	 on	 the	 ATAF	 that Kelly	had	been	piloting,	having	been	hit	head-on	by	the	suicidal	Sphinx	fighter</p>
<p class="calibre1">pilot. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p191"></a>“We	 should	 meet	 with	 Commodore	 Parks	 for	 debriefing	 and	 then	 get	 you some	medical	attention,	Kelly,”	Estelle	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Together,	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	 started	 out	 the	 cargo	 bay.	 But	 as	 they	 approached,	 a number	 of	 security	 personnel,	 standing	 by	 the	 hold's	 exit,	 gathered	 themselves across	 the	 already-thin	 gap	 of	 the	 tall	 doors,	 blocking	 the	 five	 pilots	 from exiting.	At	first,	Dodds	thought	their	presence	was	to	ensure	the	security	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bay	and	to	escort	the	ATAF	pilots	to	Parks.	Estelle	attempted	to	pass.	A	halting</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand	was	raised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Something	wrong?”	she	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,	 but	 I	 can't	 allow	 you	 to	 leave,”	 Omar	 Wyatt,  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	 head	 of security,	 explained.	 “I	 have	 orders	 from	 Commodore	 Parks	 that	 you	 are	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">remain	here	until	further	notice.”	The	man	stood	ahead	of	the	other	members	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	team	who	were	each	brandishing	a	rifle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	we	must	attend	our	debriefing,”	Estelle	protested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	have	my	orders,”	Wyatt	said.	“Commodore	Parks	feels	that	in	the	ship's</p>
<p class="calibre1">current	state	it	would	be	best	for	you	all	to	remain	here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Couldn't	you	at	least	escort	us	to	our	quarters,	instead?”	Dodds	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	 is	 a	 member	 of	 my	 team	 who	 requires	 some	 medical	 attention,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	 interjected,	 nodding	 in	 Kelly's	 direction,	 not	 waiting	 for	 the	 head	 of security	 to	 answer	 Dodds.	 The	 man	 looked	 over	 at	 Kelly	 who,	 other	 than</p>
<p class="calibre1">appearing	to	be	a	little	tired,	displayed	no	signs	of	trauma	or	physical	injury	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">required	any	kind	of	urgent	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	shook	his	head.	“No,	sorry.	No-one	is	allowed	in	or	out	of	the	hold.	And</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	 our	 medical	 teams	 are	 also	 busy	 dealing	 with	 those	 suffering	 from	 more</p>
<p class="calibre1">severe	injuries.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	 fumed	 and	 was	 about	 to	 say	 something	 before	 Kelly	 stopped	 her, </p>
<p class="calibre1">shaking	 her	 head.	 Chaz	 did	 not	 seem	 in	 the	 least	 bit	 surprised	 by	 what	 was happening.	He	swore,	let	out	an	audible	sigh	and	then	stalked	off	from	the	rest	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	group,	settling	down	on	the	floor	and	propping	himself	up	against	a	rack	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">maintenance	 equipment.	 Dodds	 watched	 him	 for	 a	 bit,	 but	 the	 big	 man	 did	 not acknowledge	him	or	the	gathering	of	people	by	the	exit.	It	was	clear	his	short-lived	upbeat	demeanour	had	now	been	pushed	to	the	wayside	and	he	would	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">sink	back	into	silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	crew,	this	is	your	captain	speaking,”	Parks'	voice	came	over	the	ship's</p>
<p class="calibre1">PA.	 “We	 are	 ready	 to	 make	 the	 return	 jump	 to	 Spirit.	 Please	 finalise	 jump</p>
<p class="calibre1">preparations.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle,	 Kelly	 and	 Enrique	 wandered	 off	 to	 join	 Chaz,	 whilst	 Dodds	 made</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	last-ditch	attempt	to	leave	the	hold.	“I	need	to	take	a	leak,”	he	threatened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	you'll	just	have	to	go	in	your	suit,”	Wyatt	answered	with	a	shrug. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Parks	bid	farewell	to	Mandeep	and	watched	as	 <i class="calibre4">Grendel's	Mother</i>	opened	a	jump</p>
<p class="calibre1">point	and	exited	the	system,	the	swirling	jump	point	closing	with	the	departure</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	carrier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Open	a	jump	point	to	Spirit,”	Parks	said	to	Liu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 sir.”	 Liu	 punched	 the	 required	 data	 into	 his	 console.	 Ahead	 of	 them</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	jump	point	formed	and,	as	before,	when	they	had	originally	departed	Spirit, </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	 started	 forward,	 followed	 by	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	 and	  <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>.	 This	 time,	 however, Meyers	and	Hawke	allowed	a	greater	distance	between	their	carriers	and	Parks'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	suffered	a	power	failure,	they	would	have	ample	stopping	distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks,	sat	in	the	captain's	chair,	just	behind	the	navigator	and	comms	officer</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	the	front,	was	drawn	from	his	deep	thoughts	by	the	flicker	of	something	out	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 frontal	 viewport.	 Had	 something	 happened	 around	 the	 jump	 point? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	 that	 wasn't	 normal?	 Just	 as	 he	 thought	 he	 had	 imagined	 it,	 it</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	streak	of	what	appeared	to	be	lightning	coursed	its	way	right	around	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">portal,	closely	following	its	rotation.	In	its	wake	it	left	a	jagged	tear	that	ripped</p>
<p class="calibre1">open,	 revealing	 the	 colourful	 space	 behind	 it.	 The	 tear	 then	 appeared	 to	 heal itself,	 leaving	 behind	 no	 evidence	 of	 the	 abnormality	 that	 had	 grabbed	 Parks' </p>
<p class="calibre1">attention.	He	rose	from	his	chair	and	wandered	to	the	front	of	the	bridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	was	that?”	he	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain?”	Liu	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That...	thing	around	the	jump	point?	It	looked	like	lightning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	sorry,	sir,	I	must	have	missed	it.”	Liu	tapped	at	his	console.	“Systems</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	not	reporting	any	issues.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 began	 to	 wonder	 if	 the	 injury	 to	 his	 head	 was	 preventing	 him	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking	and	seeing	straight;	though	the	stars	were	usually	never	that	big	or	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">shape.	 He	 began	 to	 return	 to	 his	 seat,	 seeing	 that	 the	 portal	 had	 returned	 to	 its normal	state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 portal,	 however,	 did	 so	 for	 but	 only	 for	 a	 few	 seconds,	 before	 two</p>
<p class="calibre1">smaller	 streaks	 ripped	 through	 it	 just	 as	 the	 first,	 rupturing	 it	 in	 the	 same	 way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet	 another	 and	 another	 appeared,	 tearing	 the	 pool	 in	 a	 similar	 fashion,	 like	 a knife	 slashing	 a	 canvas.	 Pockets	 of	 intense	 white	 light	 started	 to	 build	 in	 the region	of	the	slashes,	giving	the	impression	that	the	jump	point	was	bleeding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">None	of	it	was	sitting	right	with	Parks	and	the	sight	was	now	grabbing	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p193"></a>attentions	 of	 most	 of	 the	 bridge	 crew,	 their	 concern	 for	 the	 anomaly	 causing them	to	leave	their	systems	unattended. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liu's	console	began	to	whine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	that?”	Parks	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	 the	 jump	 point	 appears	 to	 be	 collapsing!”	 Liu	 said,	 his	 hands	 darting across	his	console.	“I	would	strongly	suggest	we	pull	back.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bring	 us	 to	 a	 halt,	 Mr	 Liu!	 Cancel	 the	 jump	 request!”	 Parks	 ordered	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	began	to	cross	the	threshold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liu	attempted	to	prevent	the	carrier's	further	descent	into	the	unstable	jump</p>
<p class="calibre1">point,	 but	 his	 efforts	 served	 only	 to	 slow	 their	 advance	 rather	 than	 stop	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moments	 later,	 the	 frontal	 viewport	 was	 swallowed	 by	 the	 swirling	 mass	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	hurtled	forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	started	to	tumble,	slow	at	first	before	it	started	to	build	up	speed.	As the	carrier	began	to	shudder	Parks	ordered	his	crew	to	brace	themselves,	before</p>
<p class="calibre1">finding	 his	 own	 seat.	 He	 held	 on	 tight	 to	 the	 arm	 rests,	 staring	 out	 at	 the	 usual sight	before	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whilst	what	the	carrier	now	travelled	through	bore	many	of	the	hallmarks</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 jump	 space,	 the	 familiar	 blue	 haze	 was	 nowhere	 to	 be	 seen.	 Instead,  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i> appeared	 to	 be	 surrounded	 by	 what	 looked	 like	 thick,	 blood-red	 clouds.	 Angry streaks	 of	 electricity	 danced	 and	 crashed	 within	 them,	 as	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	 continued	 its journey	into	the	unknown.	The	intensity	of	the	shuddering	grew	the	further	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	to	plunge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Time	 appeared	 to	 slow.	 Parks	 turned	 his	 head	 to	 look	 around	 the	 ship,	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">surroundings	 somehow	 blurred.	 Everything	 appeared	 to	 be	 leaving	 translucent, </p>
<p class="calibre1">multicoloured	 trails	 behind	 them	 as	 they	 moved.	 It	 was	 like	 he	 was	 drunk, </p>
<p class="calibre1">stumbling	 down	 the	 neon	 jungle	 of	 one	 of	 Shai-Jin's	 tourist	 traps,	 the	 bright lights	of	the	city	blinding	and	confusing	his	vision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	as	Parks	thought	that	the	already	damaged	carrier	would	be	torn	apart, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	shuddering	came	to	an	abrupt	end	and,	just	like	the	blue	haze	of	jump	space, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 thundering	 red	 clouds	 parted	 gracefully	 to	 give	 way	 to	 normal	 space.	 Stars came	rushing	towards	them.	Time	returned	to	normal.	The	trails	faded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everyone	okay?”	Parks	asked	after	Liu	managed	to	bring	the	carrier	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">control,	following	a	bout	of	rapid	tapping	at	his	console's	controls.	Parks	did	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">hear	 the	 answers	 as	 he	 looked	 out	 into	 the	 featureless	 void	 that	 lay	 all	 around them.	It	was	in	stark	contrast	to	the	nebulas	that	had	played	host	to	the	conflict</p>
<p class="calibre1">zone	 they	 had	 just	 departed,	 and	 Parks	 walked	 to	 the	 front	 of	 his	 ship	 to	 take stock.	 There	 was	 not	 a	 single	 thing	 he	 recognised:	 no	 Temper,	 no	 Spirit,	 no Aster,	and	no	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	or	 <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p196"></a>“He	doesn't	know,”	Dodds	said,	settling	back	down	on	the	floor	next	to	the others.	“He	assumes	it's	just	a	result	of	the	damage	that	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	sustained	during the	battle.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I've	never	felt	a	ship	shake	like	that	before.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	 probably	 nothing	 to	 be	 concerned	 about,”	 Estelle	 muttered.	 Dodds</p>
<p class="calibre1">guessed	that	since	being	ordered	to	remain	in	the	cargo	hold,	Estelle	was	feeling</p>

<p class="calibre1">In	one	of	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	conference	rooms,	Parks	sat	down	at	an	oval	glass	table	with	a number	of	his	senior	staff.	The	wound	on	his	head	had	been	bandaged	and	he'd</p>
<p class="calibre1">given	 himself	 a	 general	 clean	 up	 while	 he	 charged	 Liu	 with	 finding	 out	 where the	carrier	had	emerged.	Many	of	those	present	in	the	conference	room	also	wore</p>

<p class="calibre1">Following	 their	 arrival	 into	 the	 unknown,	 Parks	 had	 requested	 they	 gather</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 captain,”	 Liu	 nodded.	 He	 picked	 up	 a	 small	 hand-held	 device	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">tapped	away	at	the	screen,	prompting	a	large	holographic	projection	to	spring	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 the	 centre	 of	 the	 table,	 displaying	 a	 galactic	 map.	 It	 was	 cluttered	 with somewhat	excessive	amounts	of	detail,	highlighting	trade	routes,	jumpgates	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">points,	 as	 well	 as	 marking	 entire	 regions	 of	 space	 that	 were	 a	 part	 of	 the Confederacy,	and	those	that	were	declared	Independent.	At	one	end	of	the	map</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 Confederation	 star	 system	 of	 Temper	 was	 highlighted	 and,	 at	 the	 other,	 the Independent	system	of	Aster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liu	continued	to	tap	away	at	the	device	he	held,	dimming	star	systems	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">removing	 trade	 routes,	 jumpgates	 and	 other	 pieces	 of	 data	 that	 were	 of	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">relevance.	Eventually,	the	Aster	and	Temper	systems	were	left	as	the	main	focal</p>
<p class="calibre1">points	 of	 Liu's	 presentation.	 He	 made	 some	 final	 adjustments,	 centring	 in	 on <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	position	on	the	map,	located	within	the	Aster	system,	and	then	began	to recount. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Following	the	previous	operation,	we	prepared	to	make	the	jump	back	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spirit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 dotted	 line	 made	 its	 way	 across	 the	 galactic	 map,	 from	 Aster	 back</p>
<p class="calibre1">towards	the	Temper	system,	illustrating	his	point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	we	witnessed,	the	jump	point	became	unstable	and	we	were	unable	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">prevent	our	descent	within.	The	'jump'	we	experienced	threw	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	navicoms</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	of	sync	and	it	took	them	quite	sometime	before	they	were	able	to	establish	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">link	with	the	nearest	navigation	buoy.	If	we	assume	the	data	it	has	transmitted	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">accurate,	then	it	appears	we	arrived	not	back	at	Temper,	but...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	tapped	at	the	device	in	hand.	The	galactic	map	zoomed	out	a	long	way, </p>
<p class="calibre1">revealing	 yet	 more	 star	 systems.	 The	 dotted	 line	 traced	 its	 way,	 not	 towards Temper,	 but	 to	 a	 star	 system	 in	 the	 opposite	 direction	 to	 that	 which	 the	 carrier</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p198"></a>had	intended	to	travel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“...	here,”	Liu	concluded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 section	 heads	 gathered	 around	 the	 table	 gaped	 at	 the	 holographic</p>
<p class="calibre1">display	and	the	highlighted	star	system	that	the	line	had	traced	itself	toward.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">system	was	named	Phylent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Phylent?”	Parks	asked	in	total	surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,”	Liu	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We're	in	Imperial	space?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	afraid	so,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks'	 gaze	 shot	 to	 the	 many	 windows	 of	 the	 conference	 room	 and	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">space	 outside	 that,	 thankfully,	 remained	 calm	 and	 uneventful.	 Even	 so,	 there</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 mutterings	 and	 mumblings	 from	 the	 others	 at	 the	 table	 as	 they	 stared	 in disbelief	at	the	map.	Parks'	mind	raced.	At	this	very	moment	in	time,	he	and	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">ship	were	in	the	one	place	that	they	did	not	want	to	be.	He	looked	around	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">seated	at	the	table	knowing	that,	whilst	they	were	aware	of	the	danger	that	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">faced,	being	in	a	part	of	space	that	was	said	to	be	embroiled	in	civil	war,	none</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 confess	 to	 appreciating	 the	 danger	 more	 than	 he.	 The	 failed	 operation	 to retake	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	had	merely	hinted	at	what	the	Confederacy	and	her	allies	were	up</p>
<p class="calibre1">against,	 and	 had	 it	 not	 been	 for	 the	 ATAFs	 no-one	 would	 have	 returned	 home after	the	battle.	They	had	to	get	away	from	Imperial	space	as	soon	as	possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 a	 moment,	 Parks	 regained	 his	 composure	 and	 turned	 his	 attention</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	to	the	meeting.	At	this	time,	more	than	ever,	he	must	maintain	a	cool,	calm</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	collected	conduct. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	called	for	silence.	“How	is	that	possible,	Mr	Liu?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	think	that	perhaps	Mr	Marsh	could	explain	in	more	detail?”	Liu	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heads	turned	to	a	rather	thickset	man	seated	next	to	Liu,	who	straightened</p>
<p class="calibre1">up.	 As	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	 chief	 engineer,	 Matthew	 Marsh	 was	 in	 a	 far	 better	 position	 to answer	Parks'	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	 seems	 that	 there	 was	 a	 malfunction	 in	 the	 jump	 engines,	 most	 likely</p>
<p class="calibre1">caused	 by	 the	 damage	 we	 sustained	 during	 the	 battle,”	 Marsh	 began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Unfortunately,	due	to	the	nature	of	the	issue	it	was	not	something	that	we	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	pinpointed	until	we	attempted	to	use	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	scowled.	It	sounded	like	a	very	weak	excuse	for	such	a	serious	issue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Marsh	 added,	 “Our	 pre-jump	 safety	 checks	 and	 individual	 unit	 tests</p>
<p class="calibre1">reported	no	faults	and	everything	seemed	to	be	working	as	expected.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	it	 <i class="calibre4">didn't</i>	work,	did	it,	Mr	Marsh?”	Parks	said,	irritably. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	we	get	back	to	Spirit,	I	want	a	full	review	of	all	jump	safety	checks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This	 could	 have	 destroyed	 the	 ship	 and	 killed	 everyone	 aboard.”	 This	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p199"></a>directed	at	everyone	within	the	room,	though	Marsh	fidgeted	as	Parks'	eyes	fell upon	him.	“How	is	it	that	we	managed	to	get	from	here	to	here	so	easily?”	Parks</p>
<p class="calibre1">asked	after	studying	the	galactic	map	for	a	few	moments,	pointing	from	Aster	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Phylent	system,	that	lay	close	to	the	Imperial-Independent	border. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 that	 is	 actually	 quite	 interesting,”	 Marsh	 started,	 before	 back-</p>
<p class="calibre1">pedalling	upon	seeing	Parks'	stony	face.	“Er...	I	think	that	the	malfunction	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">jump	 engines	 must	 have	 thrown	 some	 of	 the	 astral	 calculations	 out.	 However, </p>
<p class="calibre1">owing	 to	 some	 other	 factors	 we	 have	 successfully	 compensated	 for	 those</p>
<p class="calibre1">miscalculations.	 The	 jump	 computers	 selected	 a	 cached	 version	 of	 one	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Phylent's	navigation	buoys	as	their	destination	and	dropped	us	in	a	random	part</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	system.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 actually	 fits	 in	 with	 what	 I	 was	 thinking,”	 Liu	 said.	 “Phylent	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Aster	are	more	or	less	equidistant	from	Spirit.	Basically,	we	just	went	the	wrong</p>
<p class="calibre1">way;	albeit	exceptionally	fast.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	considered	the	explanation	for	a	moment.	“Fine,”	he	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A	shame	we	don't	know	what	the	secret	speed	ingredient	is,”	Marsh	started</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	babble.	“I	have	to	say	that	I	am	actually	amazed	at	the	distance	we	managed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 cover	 in	 such	 a	 short	 space	 of	 time.	 I'm	 planning	 on	 holding	 on	 to	 the	 data from	the	jump,	so	we	can	analyse	it	once	we	return	to	Spirit.	The	findings	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">help	to	revolutionize	space	travel	and...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Put	it	in	a	report,”	Parks	said,	waving	away	the	rest	of	the	comment.	Right</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	 he	 was	 not	 prepared	 to	 allow	 the	 man	 to	 indulge	 his	 knowledge	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">enthusiasm	 for	 the	 inner	 workings	 of	 interstellar	 transportation.	 “And	 I	 think you'll	also	find	that	the	secret	ingredient	you	are	searching	for	is	just	plain	dumb</p>
<p class="calibre1">luck,	 Mr	 Marsh.	 By	 all	 rights	 this	 carrier	 should	 have	 been	 ripped	 apart.”	 He looked	back	to	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	navigator.	“Mr	Liu,	from	here	how	long	would	it	take	for us	to	return	to	Spirit?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liu	frowned.	“Under	ideal	circumstances?	Roughly	twelve,	thirteen	hours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 with	 the	 engines	 in	 their	 current	 state?”	 Parks	 once	 again	 addressed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	chief	engineer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 would	 say	 we	 are	 looking	 at	 sixteen	 to	 twenty	 hours,	 if	 not	 a	 little</p>
<p class="calibre1">longer,”	 Marsh	 said.	 “However,	 the	 engines	 aren't	 in	 a	 state	 where	 we	 could safely	make	another	jump.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	how	long	before	we	can?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I've	 not	 had	 enough	 time	 to	 estimate	 the	 cost	 of	 the	 damage	 to	 all	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dependent	systems,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	sighed.	“I	realise	that	Mr	Marsh,	but	I	need	the	best	answer	you	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">give	me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	would	reckon	around	nine	hours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p200"></a>Parks	nodded	as	he	digested	the	information.	They	were	looking	at	a	time frame	of	more	than	a	day	before	they	were	back	at	Spirit.	If	the	ATAFs	had	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 aboard,	 he	 could	 have	 ordered	 they	 jump	 back	 to	 an	 Independent	 system. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	he	knew	that	such	a	move	was	not	an	option,	since	that	could	result	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">discovery	 of	 the	 advanced	 starfighters	 by	 an	 Independent	 World	 state.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">Confederation	 were	 already	 hard-pressed	 to	 keep	 the	 fighters	 under	 wraps, </p>
<p class="calibre1">without	dumping	them	in	the	middle	of	a	random	system	for	anyone	to	gawk	at. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	would	just	have	to	take	their	chances	here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay,”	 Parks	 said	 to	 Marsh.	 “Begin	 the	 work	 as	 soon	 as	 this	 meeting	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">over.	Now,	I	need	the	rest	of	you	to	find	members	of	your	respective	teams	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">may	 be	 able	 to	 lend	 their	 skills	 to	 repairs	 and	 maintenance.	 I	 shouldn't	 need	 to reiterate	to	any	of	you	that,	in	its	current	state,  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	is	a	sitting	duck.	Most	of her	major	systems	are	operational,	but	shielding	is	minimal	and	we	have	little	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	way	of	offensive	measures.	We	are	also	unable	to	deploy	what	remains	of	our</p>
<p class="calibre1">starfighter	complement	easily;	the	cargo	holds	are	simply	not	equipped	to	launch</p>
<p class="calibre1">fighters	at	the	rate	we'd	need	to	fend	off	attackers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 thought	 of	 the	 cargo	 holds.	 Whilst	 those	 holding	 the	 ATAFs	 contained</p>
<p class="calibre1">nothing	more	than	the	five	fighters	themselves,	the	others	were	crammed	full	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	 starfighters.	 Deploying	 them	 in	 an	 emergency	 would	 be	 next	 to impossible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those	around	the	table	appeared	to	all	be	in	agreement	with	his	plan,	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes	drifting	from	the	holographic	display,	to	the	quiet	space	outside.	The	words</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Imperial	 Space”,	 “Phylent”	 and	 “Griffin”	 were	 far	 too	 close	 together	 on	 the galactic	map	for	anyone's	liking;	especially	his	own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 continued	 his	 delegation.	 “I	 need	 a	 seventy-thirty	 split	 in	 duties	 for repairs	to	the	jump	engines	and	repairs	to	the	flight	deck.	It	is	vital	that	we	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">out	of	this	system	and	away	from	Imperial	space	as	soon	as	possible;	but	it	is	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 important	 that,	 in	 the	 highly	 likely	 event	 that	 we	 are	 discovered	 by	 enemy forces,	we	are	able	to	defend	ourselves.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,”	came	the	resounding	answer	from	those	assembled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lieutenant	 Weathers,	 have	 you	 managed	 to	 contact	 either	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>?”	he	asked	of	a	woman	who	was	sitting	further	down	the	table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weathers,	 now	 working	 as	 communications	 officer	 in	 place	 of	 O'Donnell, </p>
<p class="calibre1">flipped	 through	 some	 papers	 as	 she	 spoke.	 “We	 don't	 believe	 that	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	 and <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>	 are	 within	 range.	 It	 does	 not	 appear	 that	 they	 followed	 us	 into	 the jump	point	and	may	not	be	aware	of	our	current	position.	It	is	unlikely	that	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	able	to	follow	us	either,	given	the	unstable	nature	of	the	jump	point.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	as	Parks	had	suspected:	they	were	on	their	own.	“Very	well.	Is	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything	else?”	Parks'	query	was	met	by	head	shakes	and	silence.	“Then	let's	get</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p201"></a>to	 work	 immediately.	 We	 have	 a	 lot	 to	 do	 and	 very	 little	 time	 to	 spare.	 Get moving,	people.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	staff	officers	left,	Parks	noticed	that	Weathers	was	hovering,	waiting</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	everyone	else	to	vacate	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	Lieutenant?”	he	asked	once	they	were	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An	encrypted	communication	has	come	in	from	CSN	HQ,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“From	HQ?	Are	you	sure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir.	It	arrived	just	before	the	meeting.”	Weathers	seemed	as	surprised</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	he	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,	Lieutenant.	I'll	take	it	in	my	private	office.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weathers	 nodded	 and	 left	 Parks	 to	 ponder	 the	 speed	 at	 which	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Confederation	 Stellar	 Navy	 had	 succeeded	 in	 pinpointing	 his	 location,	 so	 soon after	their	recent	accident. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Compared	 to	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 ship,	 Parks'	 private	 office	 was	 far	 more	 lavishly decorated.	Wood	panelling	covered	much	of	the	cold,	grey	steel	and	a	number	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">colourful	ornaments	were	scattered	here	and	there.	A	handful	of	small	paintings</p>
<p class="calibre1">hung	on	the	walls,	depicting	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	and	other	vessels.	Parks'	eyes	strayed	to	the painting	of	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	as	he	made	his	way	to	his	desk	and	the	commodore	caught</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself	 wondering	 of	 how	 different	 things	 might	 have	 been	 had	 their	 mission</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	a	success. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Activating	the	computer	screen	at	his	desk,	he	saw	the	CSN	message.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">screen	read, </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Encrypted	Message	Received</p>
<p class="calibre1">FTAO:	Commodore	Elliott	F.	Parks</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">On	 either	 side	 of	 the	 greeting	 resided	 an	 image	 of	 a	 padlock,	 further</p>
<p class="calibre1">emphasising	that	the	message	was	secured.	Parks	tapped	“Read”	with	his	finger</p>
<p class="calibre1">tip	 and	 was	 duly	 challenged	 to	 authentic	 his	 identity	 to	 the	 system,	 prompting him	for	a	password,	iris	scan,	and	voice	recognition.	Both	the	iris	scan	and	voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">recognition	took	a	number	of	attempts	to	verify.	It	appeared	the	system	was	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">suffering.	After	a	time,	the	message	playback	started. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p202"></a>“I	hope	this	message	finds	you	well,	Elliott,”	a	grating	voice	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 was	 stunned	 to	 see	 that	 he	 was	 looking	 at	 a	 video	 recorded	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1">Admiral	Turner.	The	picture	and	audio	were	suffering;	he	guessed	it	was	a	result</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	damage	to	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,	rather	than	the	message	itself.	He	moved	closer	to	the display,	 to	 listen	 carefully	 to	 what	 the	 Fleet	 Admiral	 had	 to	 say:	 right	 now,	 he could	do	with	all	the	advice	he	could	get. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turner	 went	 on.	 “After	 you	 failed	 to	 return	 to	 Spirit	 with	 Commodore</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawke	or	Captain	Meyers,	we	immediately	began	a	galaxy-wide	sweep.	Luckily</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 us,	 it	 did	 not	 take	 very	 long	 to	 locate	 you.	 Since	 you	 arrived	 within	 a formerly	inhabited	Imperial	system,	we	were	able	to	detect	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	quite	quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 case	 you	 do	 not	 already	 know,	 you	 are	 in	 the	 Phylent	 system,	 close	 to	 the Imperial-Independent	border. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“First	of	all,	do	not	concern	yourself	with	the	outcome	of	your	mission	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">retake	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>.	 We	 both	 knew	 that	 this	 was	 never	 going	 to	 be	 an	 easy	 task	 to accomplish,	and	once	again	we	have	both	been	given	a	truly	unpleasant	reminder</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	kind	of	enemy	we	are	up	against.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	was	in	total	agreement.	He	recalled	how,	when	he	had	mentioned	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">appearance	of	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	within	Independent	World	space	and	his	plans	to	ambush</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 retake	 the	 massive	 battleship,	 the	 admiral	 had	 warned	 him	 of	 the	 risks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though	the	admiral	had	given	him	his	full	backing	at	the	time,	Parks	wished	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">hadn't	been	so	hasty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Secondly,	 I	 understand	 that	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	 has	 been	 heavily	 damaged	 in	 battle,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	video	message	continued.	“I	have	dispatched	Meyers	to	your	position,	along</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 a	 number	 of	 repair	 and	 medical	 vessels.	 They	 will	 not	 be	 with	 you	 for several	 hours	 yet,	 so	 I	 need	 you	 and	 your	 boys	 to	 sit	 tight.	 Imperial	 space	 is certainly	not	a	place	you	wish	to	find	yourself	adrift	and	defenceless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 shouldn't	 have	 to	 remind	 you	 either	 that	 whilst	 you	 are	 close	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Independent	 World	 space,	 there	 will	 be	 no	 help	 coming	 from	 those	 frontier</p>
<p class="calibre1">systems,	 since	 you	 should	 be	 more	 than	 aware	 that	 they	 have	 already	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">evacuated.	 Even	 if	 they	 could	 help,	 there	 would	 be	 great	 reluctance	 to	 do	 so, given	 the	 tremendous	 loss	 of	 life	 resulting	 from	 the	 destruction	 of	 the	 carrier support	 they	 laid	 on	 for	 us.	 I	 advise	 that	 we	 not	 seek	 to	 involve	 the	 UNF	 any further	at	this	point.	So,	until	Meyers	arrives	you're	on	your	own	out	there	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	just	have	to	wait	it	out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	nodded	once	more,	relieved	to	hear	that	Meyers	would	soon	be	there</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 assist	 them.	 He	 then	 noticed	 Turner	 sit	 more	 upright,	 leaning	 forward	 in	 his chair.	Parks	had	seen	that	look	on	the	man's	face	before;	he	swallowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But	having	said	that,	your	current	location	could	not	be	more	convenient. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Regarding	 matters	 within	 the	 Temper	 system	 some	 seventy-two	 hours	 ago:</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p203"></a>intelligence	have	managed	to	locate	the	raider	who	fled	the	 <i class="calibre4">Cardinal</i>	just	before its	 destruction	 and	 discovered	 him	 to	 be	 travelling	 around	 the	 Imperial	 frontier systems.	He	arrived	in	Phylent	sometime	ago,	so	it's	likely	he	won't	be	hanging</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	too	much	longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Special	agent	Barber	has	followed	the	man	to	Arlos	starport,	where	he	has</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 attempting	 to	 offload	 various	 items	 of	 his	  <i class="calibre4">stock</i>.	 This	 whole	 thing	 could have	ended	up	as	a	wild	goose	chase,	which	would	have	been	all	the	better	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">us,	but	unfortunately	Barber	has	confirmed	to	me	that	the	man	does	indeed	have</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 entire	 dump	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Cardinal's</i>	 databanks	 in	 his	 possession.	 And	 that	 means	 he has	the	ATAF	plans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	 least	 we	 now	 know	 he	 has	 them	 and	 they	 haven't	 already	 fallen	 into</p>

<p class="calibre1">“She	planned	to	make	her	own	way	back	to	Confederation	space	once	she</p>

<p class="calibre1">And	 that's	 not	 a	 gamble	 I'm	 willing	 to	 take.	 I	 don't	 know	 whether	 to	 call	 your accidental	 winding	 up	 in	 the	 Phylent	 system	 luck	 or	 fate,	 but	 I	 know	 that	 we need	to	get	those	plans	back,	ASAP.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 was	 getting	 a	 bad	 feeling	 about	 what	 the	 admiral	 was	 about	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">suggest.	 He	 began	 scratching	 at	 the	 stubble	 on	 his	 chin	 as	 Turner's	 request continued	to	unfold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Therefore,	I	will	need	you	to	bring	her	home	with	you	or,	at	the	very	least, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	data.	If	you	cannot	bring	her,	don't	worry.	You	and	I	both	know	she	is	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	capable	of	getting	out	of	there	herself.	I	would	rather	this	is	done	whilst	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">await	the	arrival	of	Meyers,	so	you	can	depart	the	Phylent	system	as	quickly	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">possible.	We	cannot	risk	losing	yet	another	of	our	most	powerful	weapons	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Enemy	and	as	such	this	should	now	be	your	number	one	priority.	I'm	sure	that	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">shouldn't	have	to	remind	you	that	those	plans	are	worth	far	more	than	every	life</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	that	ship.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	groaned	as	the	admiral's	request	set	him	on	very	awkward	footing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 may	 be	 an	 opportunity	 to	 kill	 two	 birds	 with	 one	 stone,	 Elliott.	 We</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	 gain	 twice	 from	 this	 situation.	 With	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Red	 Devils</i>	 dead,	 we	 have	 to	 play catch	up	and	an	opportunity	like	this	may	not	come	by	again	any	time	soon,	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">ever.	I	have	taken	the	liberty	of	transmitting	the	coordinates	of	Arlos	starport	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">you,	as	well	as	extended	intelligence	concerning	the	Phylent	system.	I'm	hoping</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	 have	 all	 the	 information	 you	 need,	 since	 I	 do	 not	 recommend	 that	 you</p>
<p class="calibre1">respond	to	this	message.	Although	we	still	have	a	handful	of	comm	relay	points</p>
<p class="calibre1">secreted	around	Imperial	frontier	systems,	communications	fed	through	subspace</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p204"></a>are	 minimal.	 Any	 increase	 in	 the	 tachyon	 streams	 could	 expose	 you	 to	 hostile tracking	systems.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	as	Parks	began	to	wonder	what	had	happened	to	Hawke	in	all	of	this, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turner	answered	his	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	 for	 Commodore	 Hawke,	 he	 is	 much	 closer	 to	 your	 location	 than</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meyers	is.	When	he	saw	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	disappear	into	the	jump	point,	with	no	clue	as	to your	destination,	Hawke	took	it	upon	himself	to	assume	command.	He	ordered</p>
<p class="calibre1">Meyers	to	return	to	Spirit	to	search	for	you	there,	whilst	he	took	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	to	search	all the	 star	 systems	 adjacent	 to	 Aster.	 He,	 like	 Meyers,	 is	 aware	 of	 your	 situation and	that	I	have	requested	you	perform	a	little	errand	for	us	before	you	are	ready</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 return	 home.	 Neither	 of	 them,	 however,	 are	 privy	 to	 the	 full	 details	 of	 that errand,	 as	 I'm	 sure	 you	 can	 appreciate.	 Unless	 he	 runs	 into	 difficulties,	 or delivery	 of	 my	 instructions	 are	 delayed,	 you	 should	 expect	 Hawke	 to	 arrive	 at your	 location	 sooner	 than	 Meyers.	 If	 you	 are	 able,	 you	 should	 return	 to	 Spirit with	 him.	 Don't	 wait	 for	 Meyers,	 he	 will	 understand	 that	 you	 had	 to	 leave	 as soon	 as	 you	 were	 able.	 In	 such	 an	 event,	 we	 will	 let	 him	 know	 that	 you	 have been	found	and	are	returning	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	 is	 more	 information	 attached	 in	 the	 brief	 I	 have	 included	 with	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1">message.	You	will	need	to	relay	this	information	to	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>.	I	realise	that	it does	 not	 paint	 the	 rosiest	 of	 pictures,	 but	 we	 need	 to	 make	 sure	 our	 bases	 are covered	for	all	eventualities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take	care	of	yourself,	Elliott.	We'll	see	you	soon,”	Turner	concluded.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">message	playback	ended,	and	the	screen	displayed	a	number	of	icons,	detailing</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	additional	information	that	Turner	had	transmitted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 sighed.	 At	 least	 one	 of	 his	 questions	 had	 been	 answered:	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Confederation's	comm	points	had	sent	information	about	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	arrival	in	the system	back	to	CSN	HQ,	via	subspace	channels	-	Turner	had	sent	a	message	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	carrier	in	the	same	way.	Though	messages	travelled	far	quicker	through	jump</p>
<p class="calibre1">space	than	ships	themselves,	Parks	was	willing	to	bet	that	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	most	recent jump	would	give	them	a	run	for	their	money. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stood	up	and	paced	beside	the	window.	He	knew	what	he	had	to	do	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">didn't	 like	 it	 one	 bit.	 As	 the	 admiral	 had	 said,	 the	 ATAF	 plans	 were	 far	 more important	than	all	of	the	lives	aboard	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	-	in	fact,	more	so	than	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i> and	 <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>	combined	-	and	that	fact	terrified	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	stared	out	the	window	at	the	endless	void	of	space.	Now	that	the	blast</p>
<p class="calibre1">screens	had	come	down	from	the	carrier's	windows,	Parks	was	able	to	make	out</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	dull	grey	planet	hanging	all	alone,	not	too	far	off.	He	did	not	need	to	consult	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">system	map	to	know	that	that	was	where	Turner	needed	him	to	go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dammit,”	he	said	in	a	low	voice,	placing	a	fist	on	the	window	and	leaning</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p205"></a>against	the	glass.	“There	 <i class="calibre4">must</i>	be	another	way;	there	has	to	be	a	way	for	Barber to	come	to	me,	instead	of	 <i class="calibre4">us</i>	having	to	go	to	 <i class="calibre4">her</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 racked	 his	 brains,	 giving	 full	 consideration	 to	 every	 possibility	 that	 he could	think	of,	all	the	while	staring	towards	the	dull	grey	planet.	But	his	attempts</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 find	 a	 workable	 solution	 all	 hit	 dead	 ends.	 Turner	 was	 right:	 he	 had	 little choice	in	the	matter,	and	whether	he	liked	it	or	not	he	was	going	to	have	to	send</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 <i class="calibre4">ATAFs</i>	and	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	to	Arlos	alone,	and	leave	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	all	but	defenceless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	the	sooner	that	was	done,	the	sooner	they	could	all	get	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 his	 mind	 made	 up,	 he	 turned	 back	 to	 the	 console	 and	 closed	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">message,	 before	 rounding	 his	 desk	 and	 striding	 out	 the	 door	 to	 make	 for	 the bridge. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">C</b>haz	 continued	 watching	 the	 security	 team	 that	 guarded	 the	 entrance	 to	 the cargo	 bay.	 He	 had	 noticed	 a	 new	 face	 arrive	 earlier.

<p class="calibre1">Estelle	 was	 staring	 at	 the	 floor,	 looking	 quite	 glum,	 though	 he	 suspected</p>

<p class="calibre1">“...	gonna	be	a	lot	of	weeping	mothers	after	this	one,	I	can	tell	ya,”	one	of</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Tell	me	about	it.	They	pulled	out	this	one	girl	who	had	been	buried	under	a</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Nice	looking	thing,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	a	shame.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	 had	 noticed	 Estelle's	 expression	 change	 as	 the	 two	 men	 had	 spoken, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	woman	lowering	her	gaze	to	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	all	right,	Estelle?”	Dodds	had	asked	sometime	later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	thinking.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks,	Simon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Simon.	That	was	a	name	he	didn't	hear	used	all	too	often. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	head	of	security	was	now	back,	and	speaking	with	the	rest	of	his	team. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he	 did	 so,	 he	 looked	 around	 the	 groups	 of	 people	 sat	 in	 the	 cargo	 hold,	 but</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p207"></a>mostly	 at	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>.	 The	 other	 members	 of	 the	 security	 team	 were	 doing likewise.	It	was	clear	to	Chaz	that	the	man	was	discussing	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	and	he'd guessed	what	was	going	on	well	before	Wyatt	strode	over	to	the	five	pilots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lieutenant	de	Winter?”	Wyatt	asked	as	he	stood	over	them,	flanked	by	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">others	from	his	team. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,”	Estelle	said,	getting	to	her	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Commodore	 Parks	 wishes	 to	 speak	 to	 you	 immediately	 in	 his	 private</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	were	escorted	from	the	cargo	hold	by	the	head	of	the	security</p>
<p class="calibre1">team.	As	they	walked	through	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	decks	towards	Parks'	office,	they	were	at last	able	to	see	the	true	extent	of	the	damage.	There	were	still	many	safety	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">fire	 doors	 closed	 across	 every	 deck	 and	 as	 a	 result	 their	 journey	 was	 not</p>

<p class="calibre1">Parks	turned	back	from	where	he	was	gazing	out	the	window	in	the	direction	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Arlos	as	the	six	people	entered	his	office. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	 you	 for	 being	 so	 prompt,	 Omar,”	 he	 said.	 “Please	 wait	 outside.	 I</p>

<p class="calibre1">“At	ease.	Please	excuse	me	for	restricting	you	to	the	cargo	hold.	I	intended</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	explain	the	reasons	behind	the	move	back	at	Spirit,	but	that	is	going	to	have	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">wait.	You	may	have	noticed	that	we	are	currently	not	in	jump.”	He	indicated	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	inky-blackness	of	the	world	outside	the	carrier,	the	scene	punctuated	by	tiny</p>
<p class="calibre1">pinpricks	 of	 greys	 and	 whites	 from	 distant	 stars.	 “When	 we	 departed	 Aster, </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	suffered	a	miss-jump	and	as	a	result	we	did	not	make	it	to	our	intended destination.	 Instead,	 we	 have	 become	 temporarily	 stranded	 in	 the	 Phylent</p>
<p class="calibre1">system.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Phylent?”	Estelle	and	Kelly	both	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We're	 in	 Imperial	 space?”	 Chaz	 asked,	 mimicking	 Parks'	 own	 reaction	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	news	the	first	time	that	he	had	heard	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	nodded.	“That's	correct,	and	we	will	be	remaining	here	until	we	either</p>
<p class="calibre1">repair	our	jump	engines,	Captain	Meyers	or	Commodore	Hawke	arrive	to	assist</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p208"></a>us,	 or	 we	 are	 discovered	 by	 hostile	 forces.	 The	 situation	 is	 not	 in	 the	 least favourable	to	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	from	whatever	angle	you	look	at	it.	Whilst	rescue	is	on	the way,	we	cannot	count	on	its	arrival	for	at	least	several	more	hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	has	sustained	a	considerable	amount	of	damage	and	in	the	face	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	 attack	 would	 be	 almost	 totally	 defenceless.	 Our	 weapon	 systems	 are</p>
<p class="calibre1">unreliable,	our	shielding	is	barely	adequate,	and	we	have	no	means	of	launching</p>
<p class="calibre1">fighters.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse	 me,	 sir,	 but	 we	 could	 launch	 the	 ATAFs	 from	 the	 cargo	 hold,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	chipped	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	 you	 for	 letting	 me	 know	 that,	 Lieutenant,”	 Parks	 answered	 with	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">hint	of	sarcasm.	“But	the	situation	is	no	longer	as	straightforward	as	that,	and	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	just	received	a	communication	from	Fleet	Admiral	Turner	that	has	further</p>
<p class="calibre1">complicated	 matters.	 I	 believe	 you	 were	 all	 present	 when	  <i class="calibre4">CSN	 Cardinal</i>	 was boarded	and	destroyed	by	a	raiding	party?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,”	Estelle	said,	the	others	nodding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 believe	 that	 the	 raider	 who	 escaped	 stole	 some	 highly	 classified	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sensitive	data	that,	if	it	were	to	fall	into	enemy	hands,	could	spell	utter	disaster</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	the	Confederation	and	all	her	interests.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	was	it?”	Enrique	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	already	stated,	Mr	Todd,	that	is	classified,”	Parks	shot.	“Now	keep	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">big	mouth	of	yours	shut.	This	is	very	important	and	I	need	you	all	to	listen	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">carefully.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique	did	so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	pressed	on.	“All	you	need	to	know	is	that	we	have	to	get	it	back.	As	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">happens,	 a	 government	 service	 agent	 has	 tracked	 the	 raider	 to	 this	 very	 system and	is	in	the	process	of	reacquiring	the	data.	She	planned	to	immediately	return</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 Confederation	 space	 once	 she	 had	 done	 so,	 but	 the	 instability	 of	 this	 entire region	could	make	that	considerably	more	difficult	than	she	first	expected.	And</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	is	that	which	has	made	my	next	decision	so	very	difficult	because	I	need	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">five	to	go	and	get	it	from	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	scanned	the	group	as	he	finished	speaking,	noticing,	as	he	had	expected, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz's	narrowed	eyes	upon	him.	The	others	said	nothing,	turning	to	look	at	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">another.	Parks	pressed	on,	looking	to	head	off	the	two	dozen	questions	he	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	 coming.	 “So,	 I	 will	 be	 requiring	 you	 to	 travel,	 in	 the	 ATAFs,	 to	 Arlos starport,	where	you	will	meet	the	agent,	retrieve	the	stolen	data	card	that	was	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">mission	target	and	return	to	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	sounded	very	simple	when	Parks	put	it	that	way.	He	only	wished	that	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	tapped	the	keyboard	in	front	him.	“This	is	who	you	will	be	looking	for.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p209"></a>Parks	turned	the	monitor	of	his	desk	around	to	face	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>,	keeping	a	close eye	on	Chaz	as	he	did	so.	Unlike	the	others,	whose	attention	was	focused	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">screen,	 studying	 the	 profile	 of	 the	 woman	 they	 were	 to	 meet,	 Chaz's	 eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">flickered	to	the	monitor	for	only	a	couple	of	seconds	before	darting	back	to	meet</p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks'.	 For	 a	 while,	 the	 two	 men	 locked	 eyes,	 Parks	 maintaining	 a	 serious	 and unwavering	expression,	Chaz	keeping	his	own	just	as	steady. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 said,	 “This	 is	 Clare	 Barber,	 an	 agent	 working	 for	 the	 Confederate</p>
<p class="calibre1">Secret	 Service.	 She	 has	 a	 long-standing	 history	 of	 providing	 her	 government</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 outstanding	 results.”	 He	 continued	 to	 lock	 looks	 with	 Chaz.	 None	 of	 the others	 had	 picked	 up	 on	 the	 exchange,	 their	 eyes	 remaining	 focused	 on	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">screen,	which	detailed	Barber	as	being	light-skinned,	thirty-nine	years	old,	five</p>
<p class="calibre1">foot	nine	inches	tall,	and	with	shoulder-length,	straight	black	hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She's	 likely	 to	 be	 maintaining	 a	 low	 profile,	 so	 you	 will	 need	 to	 put	 in	 a little	 extra	 effort	 to	 find	 her	 when	 arriving	 at	 the	 starport.	 She	 is	 obviously	 not aware	 of	 your	 coming	 to	 meet	 her,	 so	 do	 not	 expect	 her	 to	 come	 running	 and waving	 her	 arms	 in	 the	 air	 the	 second	 you	 arrive.	 We	 are	 aware	 that	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Imperium	 has	 extensive	 information	 on	 some	 of	 our	 operatives,	 so	 she	 will</p>
<p class="calibre1">undoubtedly	 be	 on	 their	 watch	 list,	 due	 to	 her	 persisted	 presence	 within	 their space.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	had	still	not	broken	eye	contact	with	Chaz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	shouldn't	need	to	remind	you	all	of	the	very	hazardous	predicament	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	 all	 find	 ourselves	 in	 right	 now,”	 Parks	 said,	 before	 he	 swivelled	 the	 screen back	 around.	 “And	 as	 such,	 it	 is	 necessary	 that	 upon	 leaving	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	 and travelling	 to	 the	 starport	 you	 take	 maximum	 precautions.	 That	 means	 avoiding</p>
<p class="calibre1">detection	by	hostile	forces	at	all	times.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	cleared	her	 throat,	then	said,	 “Pardon	my	ignorance,	 sir,	but	 whilst</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	are	black,	the	ATAFs	are	not	invisible.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You're	 half	 right,	 Lieutenant.	 They	 are	 indeed	 black,	 and	 the	 cloaking</p>
<p class="calibre1">device	fitted	into	each	of	the	fighters	is	a	feature	we	wished	to	keep	under	wraps</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 as	 long	 as	 possible.	 However,	 circumstances	 like	 these	 often	 force	 matters forward.”	He	paused	for	a	moment	to	watch	their	expressions,	the	look	of	total</p>
<p class="calibre1">surprise	clear	on	all	of	their	faces;	his	own	deadly	serious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry,	sir.	Did	you	say	a	cloaking	device?”	Dodds	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	Lieutenant,	I	did.	And	it	is	exactly	what	you	likely	believe	it	to	be:	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">system	designed	to	render	the	fighter	totally	undetectable	by	almost	any	means,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 said.	 Now	 that	 he	 had	 their	 total	 and	 undivided	 attention,	 he	 went	 on	 to explain	 the	 activation	 and	 features	 of	 the	 device.	 The	 system	 would	 render	 the ATAF	completely	invisible	to	both	the	naked	eye	and	all	radar	systems,	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">exception	 of	 those	 on-board	 the	 ATAFs	 themselves.	 Even	 the	 glow	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p210"></a>engines	would	be	effectively	masked	by	the	device. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	invisibility	effect	of	the	cloak	itself	is	linked	to	the	ATAFs'	shields,	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	must	be	enabled	at	all	times,	even	when	you	disembark	upon	entering	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">port.	I	want	to	make	it	absolutely	clear	right	now	that	if	you	disengage	the	cloak</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 the	 shields	 then	 you	 will	 expose	 yourselves	 and	 blow	 your	 cover.	 You	 will therefore	have	to	push	yourselves	back	through	the	shield	when	you	wish	to	re-enter	the	fighters,	a	tedious	but	elementary	exercise	as	you	all	should	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	should	also	know	that	although	you	can	use	your	weapons	whilst	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">system	is	activated,	it	is	not	recommended	as	it	will	have	detrimental	effects	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	cloak.	Should	you	do	so,	then	your	shielding	will	react	for	a	few	seconds</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	light	you	up	like	a	Christmas	tree.	Similar	effects	will	be	caused	by	anything</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	tests	your	shields	to	any	degree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Unfortunately,	I'm	not	a	scientist,	so	I	cannot	list	every	conceivable	failing</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	device.	But	since	you	are	not	to	engage	any	hostile	forces	at	all,	I	would</p>
<p class="calibre1">strongly	 advise	 against	 using	 any	 of	 your	 weapons	 whilst	 cloaked.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">technology	 is	 something	 that	 we	 do	 not	 wish	 anyone	 to	 become	 aware	 of	 –</p>
<p class="calibre1">whether	 allied	 or	 enemy	 -	 and	 that	 means	 not	 de-activating	 the	 cloak	 for	 any reason	whilst	you	are	proceeding	with	this	mission. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now:	do	you	all	fully	understand	me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,”	the	five	mumbled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">What? </i>”	 Parks	 said.	 It	 had	 been	 a	 lengthy	 brief,	 but	 he	 needed	 to	 ensure they	were	all	still	very	much	awake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	 yes,	 sir!”	 they	 repeated	 much	 louder,	 though	 with	 the	 exception	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excellent.”	 Parks	 tapped	 at	 the	 screen	 before	 him	 and	 Omar	 Wyatt	 re-</p>
<p class="calibre1">entered	 his	 office,	 coming	 to	 stand	 by	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>.	 “de	 Winter,	 Dodds,	 I	 want you	 two	 to	 remain	 here	 for	 a	 moment	 whilst	 I	 discuss	 some	 extra	 details	 with you.	The	rest	of	you	head	back	down	to	the	cargo	hold.	I	have	already	made	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">flight	 team	 down	 there	 aware	 of	 my	 plans	 and	 they	 should	 have	 almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">completed	preparations	by	the	time	you	return.	Dismissed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	head	of	security	led	the	other	three	out.	Parks	watched	them	go,	Chaz</p>
<p class="calibre1">meeting	his	eyes	for	one	last	time	before	he	left	the	office. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	watched	as	the	commodore	rose	from	his	chair	and	paced	back	and	forth</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 front	 of	 his	 office	 window	 for	 a	 moment,	 the	 grey	 and	 uninviting	 form	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p211"></a>Arlos	 just	 visible	 to	 one	 side	 of	 his	 view.	 He	 began	 contemplating	 why	 Parks may	have	requested	he	and	Estelle	remain	behind.	Parks	did	not	take	his	eyes	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">either	of	them,	studying	them	as	if	they	were	a	pair	of	wanted	criminals	he	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">chased	for	years,	having	at	last	been	brought	before	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	stopped	his	pacing	and	fixed	him	with	a	stern	look.	“I	don't	suppose	I</p>
<p class="calibre1">need	to	ask	if	you're	sober	now,	Dodds?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Totally,	sir,”	he	said	in	earnest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And	 I	 should	 damn	 well	 think	 so,	 Lieutenant!”	 Parks	 snapped,	 his	 eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">narrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite	his	earlier	actions,	it	was	very	clear	to	Dodds	that	Parks	did	not	feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 had	 redeemed	 himself.	 Dodds	 detected	 that	 he	 was	 struggling	 with	 second</p>
<p class="calibre1">thoughts	about	sending	the	team	away,	unsupervised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	 you	 get	 to	 the	 starport	 I	 don't	 want	 any	 performances	 from	 you, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds.	You	and	Todd	will	fall	in	line	behind	de	Winter	and	follow	the	chain	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">command.	 You	 will	 do	  <i class="calibre4">exactly</i>	 as	 you	 are	 ordered,	 without	 letting	 either	 your over-inflated	ego	or	have-a-go-hero	attitude	interfere	with	your	assignment.	Got</p>
<p class="calibre1">that?”	He	stabbed	a	finger	onto	his	desk	with	each	point	he	made. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,”	Dodds	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	want	you	to	understand	that	this	is	the	most	difficult	decision	I	have	ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 to	 make	 in	 all	 of	 my	 career,	 if	 not	 my	 whole	 life,”	 Parks	 continued,	 now looking	 to	 both	 Dodds	 and	 Estelle.	 “I	 am	 leaving	 my	 ship	 and	 its	 entire	 crew defenceless,	 whilst	 I	 send	 you	 off	 on	 a	 mission	 you	 were	 never	 trained	 for.	 I don't	 want	 any	 of	 you	 to	 take	 unnecessary	 risks.	 Get	 into	 the	 starport,	 identify yourselves	to	Barber,	get	the	data	card	and	return	to	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>.	Nothing	more.	Am	I making	myself	clear?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,”	they	both	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“de	 Winter,”	 Parks	 said,	 his	 voice	 still	 lined	 with	 traces	 of	 anger.	 “Upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaving	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,	I	want	you	and	your	team	to	position	yourselves	as	close	to	the underside	of	the	carrier	as	you	can	before	activating	the	cloak.	This	will	ensure</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	you	are	not	seen	by	any	of	the	crew	and	your	close	proximity	to	the	carrier</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	 ensure	 you	 cannot	 be	 detected	 by	 the	 radars.	 Do	 not	 move	 away	 from	 the carrier	 until	 you	 are	 all	 fully	 cloaked.	 As	 I	 already	 stated,	 it	 is	 vital	 that	 we maintain	 secrecy	 regarding	 the	 device	 -	 from	 both	 enemy	 and	 allied	 forces.	 Is that	understood?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,”	Estelle	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“On	top	of	that,	Lieutenant,	I	am	expecting	you	to	keep	this	group	together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	am	charging	you	with	no	less	than	the	full	responsibility	of	bringing	back	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	that	data	card,	but	five	ATAFs	and	five	starfighter	pilots,	as	well.	I	want	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">make	it	absolutely	 clear	that	you	 are	not	to	 return	to	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	until	you	have	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p212"></a>data	 card	 in	 your	 possession,	 or	 you	 can	 at	 least	 reliably	 determine	 what	 has happened	 to	 it.	 If,	 after	 successfully	 completing	 your	 mission,	 you	 return	 here only	to	discover	that	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	has	been	blown	to	pieces	by	hostile	forces,	you	are to	do	nothing	but	wait	for	Captain	Meyers	or	Commodore	Hawke	to	arrive	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">system.	 Even	 if	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	 is	 nothing	 more	 than	 a	 burnt-out	 hulk	 you	 will	 not disengage	your	cloak,	engage	hostile	forces,	or	attempt	to	establish	any	contact</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	non-Confederation	vessels.	You	will	hold	position	even	if	it	means	waiting</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	your	air	to	run	out.	Do	not	even	make	for	any	of	the	jumpgates,	since	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">will	 likely	 be	 swarming	 with	 hostile	 forces.	 Am	 I	 making	 myself	 fully</p>
<p class="calibre1">understood?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,”	Estelle	said	again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	shifted	his	eyes	in	Estelle's	direction.	He	could	hear	in	her	voice	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	was	starting	to	get	frustrated.	It	was	only	sometime	ago	that	she	had	led	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">team	 to	 victory	 against	 Imperial	 forces,	 saving	 a	 great	 deal	 of	 not	 only</p>
<p class="calibre1">Confederation	 lives,	 but	 also	 those	 of	 the	 allied	 United	 Naval	 Forces.	 Even	 so, she	 had	 not	 been	 allowed	 to	 be	 debriefed	 and	 receive	 the	 congratulations	 and thanks	 she	 merited.	 Instead,	 she	 had	 been	 stuffed	 into	 a	 cargo	 hold	 and	 been made	to	sit	and	wait.	And	now	she	was	being	shouted	at.	Dodds	felt	for	her;	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">deserved	the	praise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks,	however,	seemed	satisfied	that	he	was	being	taken	seriously	and	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	could	trust	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>.	 He	 relaxed	 his	 tone	 somewhat	 and	 asked	 the	 pair	 if they	were	clear	on	what	they	were	looking	for	and	what	they	had	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	he	had	finalized	all	the	details,	Parks	said,	“I	should	also	let	you	know</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 neither	 Commodore	 Hawke	 or	 Captain	 Meyers	 are	 aware	 that	 the	 ATAFs</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	cloaking	abilities	and,	circumstances	notwithstanding,	I'd	like	it	to	remain</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 way.	 The	 details	 of	 your	 'errand'	 are	 also	 classified	 and	 you	 should	 refer either	 the	 commodore	 or	 the	 captain	 to	 Admiral	 Turner	 if	 they	 need	 to	 know what	you	have	been	doing.	Now,	do	you	have	any	other	questions?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,”	Dodds	began,	before	pausing	to	consider	his	question.	“Er...	some	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	ATAF's	weaponry	is	not	active.	Are	there	any	other	systems	that	may	not	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">operational	that	we	may	need	to	know	about	ahead	of	our	task?”	He	was	aware</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	the	question	might	be	just	the	sort	that	could	enrage	the	commodore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	 you're	 referring	 to	 the	 plasma	 accelerators,	 Dodds,	 then	 this	 is</p>
<p class="calibre1">intentional.	 There	 was	 an	 agreement	 made	 prior	 to	 the	 beginning	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Operation</i> <i class="calibre4">Menelaus</i>	that	no	beam	weapons	or	torpedoes	would	be	directed	at	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>.	This agreement	 was	 in	 place	 to	 ensure	 that	 we	 could	 retake	 the	 battleship	 without causing	it	critical	or	irrecoverable	damage.	But	no,	there	are	no	other	features	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	fighter	that	you	need	to	be	aware	of.	Now,	if	that	is	all?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	sir,”	Estelle	said,	whilst	Dodds	nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p213"></a>“Good.	Now	get	down	to	the	cargo	hold	and	get	going.	There	is	not	much time	to	spare.	Security	will	escort	you	back	down.	Dismissed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	and	Estelle	started	out	of	Parks'	office	and	caught	his	last	words	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	as	the	doors	opened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	luck,  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>.	I'll	meet	you	upon	your	return	to	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">A	 little	 way	 from	 where	 Dodds	 and	 Enrique	 stood,	 Estelle	 ascended	 the	 ladder into	 her	 ATAF,	 just	 as	 they	 had	 all	 done	 only	 a	 few	 hours	 earlier,	 crew	 milling around	to	make	preparations	for	her	departure.	As	Kelly	was	beckoned	forward</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	board	her	fighter	and	perform	safety	checks,	Enrique	sensed	Dodds	lean	over</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	his	direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doesn't	this	strike	you	as	weird?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	you	mean?”	Enrique	asked,	keeping	his	voice	low	as	Dodds	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	 starfighter	 is	 monstrously	 powerful	 compared	 to	 the	 anything	 else	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	ever	seen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of	course	it	is	–	it's	the	next	generation	of	fighter.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	shook	his	head	and	leaned	closer.	“Mate,	listen:	it	took	just	 <i class="calibre4">three</i>	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">these	things	to	take	down	an	Imperial	frigate;	Kelly	had	a	head-on	collision	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	heavy-class	Imperial	fighter.	That	thing	was	blown	to	pieces	but	there	isn't	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">single,	tiny	little	scratch	on	her	ATAF;	and	now	we're	being	told	that	these	things</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	  <i class="calibre4">cloak</i>?	 I	 mean,	 don't	 you	 see?	 You	 don't	 build	 something	 like	 this	 for	 no reason.	 This	 is	 a	 lot	 more	 significant	 than	 just	 the	 next	 generation	 of	 fighter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	the	hell	is	going	on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique	thought	about	it	for	a	moment,	then	shrugged.	“Dunno,	man.	We'll</p>
<p class="calibre1">probably	find	out	a	little	later	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'd	 rather	 know	 sooner.	 There's	 something	 about	 all	 this	 that	 doesn't	 feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	pair	stood	in	silence	for	a	while,	watching	as	Kelly	affixed	her	helmet</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 the	 ladder	 was	 wheeled	 away	 from	 the	 side	 of	 the	 craft.	 Dodds	 was	 then called	forward	to	prepare	for	takeoff,	leaving	just	Chaz	and	Enrique	together	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	cargo	bay	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	okay?”	Enrique	asked	the	big	man,	as	Estelle	taxied	forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will	be	once	this	is	all	over,”	Chaz	replied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique	noted	the	 usual	enthusiastic	tone	 in	his	voice.	 “Shouldn't	be	more</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p214"></a>than	 a	 few	 more	 hours,”	 he	 said.	 “Let's	 say,	 four	 hours	 there,	 one	 hour	 to	 find that	spy,	four	hours	back.	Then	we	can	relax.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	said	nothing,	the	air	about	him	somehow	deader	than	ever. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“So,	let	me	get	this	straight,”	Enrique	was	saying,	his	voice	coming	in	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds'	intercom.	“We	have	to	go	and	rescue	a	spy?	Shouldn't	those	guys	be	able</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	look	after	themselves?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Agent,”	Kelly	corrected	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 ordered	 by	 Parks,	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	 had	 positioned	 themselves	 beneath</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,	the	starfighters	not	a	few	meters	from	the	underbelly	of	the	vessel.	Just ahead	of	them	hung	the	small,	grey,	uninspiring	planet	that	was	their	destination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	felt	an	unwelcoming	vibe	coming	from	it	and	thought	it	not	a	place</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 would	 traditionally	 be	 home	 to	 a	 starport.	 As	 he	 had	 positioned	 himself underneath	the	carrier	and	awaited	Enrique	and	Chaz	to	join	the	others	already</p>
<p class="calibre1">there,	 he	 had	 studied	 the	 overview	 of	 the	 Phylent	 system	 on	 his	 starfighter's computer,	 discovering	 it	 to	 be	 home	 to	 a	 number	 of	 asteroid	 belts	 and	 planets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 the	 most	 part,	 the	 system	 was	 uninhabited,	 though	 it	 was	 rich	 in	 raw</p>
<p class="calibre1">materials,	minerals	and	other	elements.	It	occurred	to	him	that	the	port	would	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">favoured	 by	 those	 seeking	 their	 fortunes,	 typically	 frequented	 by	 miners	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">entrepreneurs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	made	him	think	back	to	the	time	before	he	had	joined	the	Navy,	when	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 entertained	 dreams	 of	 mining	 asteroids	 for	 their	 raw	 content.	 He	 had	 been talked	 out	 of	 it	 by	 his	 father,	 who	 had	 told	 him	 horror	 stories	 of	 the	 incredible hard	work,	long	hours	and	many	terrific	accidents	that	went	hand	in	hand	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">such	a	lifestyle.	He	still	sometimes	wondered	if	he	may	have	managed	to	make</p>
<p class="calibre1">enough	money	to	retire	after	a	couple	of	decades	of	hard	labour.	It	didn't	have	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	anywhere	fancy,	but	so	long	as	he	had	enough	cash	to	buy	a	bar	on	a	laid	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">planet	and	become	the	proprietor,	he	would	be	happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Preparing	to	engage	cloak,”	Estelle	said,	returning	Dodds	to	reality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Think	 it'll	 work?”	 Enrique	 asked	 before	 their	 wing	 leader	 activated	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">system;	it	was	obvious	he	was	leaving	Estelle	out	of	this	particular	conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 heard	 about	 the	 last	 time	 they	 tried	 something	 like	 this	 and	 how	 it	 all went	horribly	wrong,”	Kelly	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	did?”	said	Dodds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	it	does,	then	she'll	either	end	up	several	hundred	miles	away	from	here</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p215"></a>or	she'll	travel	into	the	future.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	doesn't	sound	too	bad,”	Enrique	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Before	 coming	 back	 a	 few	 minutes	 later	 having	 either	 gone	 mad	 or</p>
<p class="calibre1">become	one	with	the	ship.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	said	nothing	and	just	swallowed	hard	as	Estelle	activated	the	cloak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 found,	 however,	 that	 there	 was	 nothing	 for	 any	 of	 them	 to	 fear:	 the	 cloak worked	 just	 as	 Parks	 had	 described,	 and	 Estelle's	 fighter	 faded	 gracefully	 from view.	 Whilst	 his	 ATAF's	 radar	 could	 still	 detect	 and	 report	 the	 presence	 of	 an object	in	place	of	where	Estelle	once	appeared,	he	could	see	nothing	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	each	of	them	had	tested	the	system	for	themselves,	Estelle	confirmed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 Parks	 that	 they	 had	 blanketed	 themselves	 from	 detection.	 Then,	 as	 one,	 the five	 invisible	 ATAFs	 slipped	 out	 from	 beneath	 the	 carrier	 and	 set	 off	 towards Arlos. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">S</b>itting	 amongst	 a	 huddled	 group	 of	 blanket-wrapped	 men	 and	 women,	 Daniel Sullivan's	 suspicions	 that	 he	 was	 being	 watched	 and	 followed	 had	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">confirmed.	A	woman	-	he	assumed	it	was,	by	the	way	she	carried	herself	-	also</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrapped	 in	 a	 blanket	 against	 the	 small	 chill	 of	 the	 starport,	 had	 been	 hovering just	out	of	sight	for	the	last	hour	or	so.	The	blanket	rested	on	the	top	of	her	head, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	folds	enclosing	her	and	hiding	her	face	from	sight.	He	was	now	aware	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	 had	 been	 tailing	 him	 as	 he	 walked	 around	 the	 port,	 whilst	 he	 had	 been attempting	 to	 find	 someone	 who	 was	 interested	 in	 his	 wares;	 his	 efforts	 so	 far having	been	met	with	disinterest	and	the	occasional	outburst	of	anger	from	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">wishing	to	be	left	alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Usually	the	massive	central	hall	of	the	starport	was	bustling,	filled	with	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">kinds	 of	 people:	 miners,	 resting	 from	 their	 labour;	 traders	 and	 couriers	 seeking work	 and	 contracts;	 and	 many,	 many	 travellers.	 Bright,	 animated	 signs,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">warm	inviting	lights	from	coffee	shops,	pubs,	various	food	bars	and	trading	posts</p>
<p class="calibre1">lining	the	walls	created	a	welcoming	ambience.	Even	in	the	most	backwater	star</p>

<p class="calibre1">Laughter	and	chatter	no	longer	filled	the	port,	the	signs	of	the	shops	were</p>

<p class="calibre1">windows	 of	 the	 stores	 had	 been	 smashed	 and	 the	 contents	 looted.	 The	 central hall	 had	 been	 transformed	 into	 a	 sea	 of	 people,	 settled	 on	 the	 floor,	 bags	 and other	personal	belongings	surrounding	them.	Young	children	lay	asleep,	cuddled</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	to	their	parents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sullivan	 found	 that,	 though	 the	 port	 was	 not	 bitterly	 cold,	 it	 could	 have</p>

<p class="calibre1">Standing	up,	he	began	to	stride	away	from	his	stalker,	partly	to	put	distance</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p217"></a>between	the	two	of	them	and	partly	to	get	away	from	the	place.	Though	he	had only	arrived	at	the	port	hours	earlier,	he'd	already	had	enough	of	Arlos	starport. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 time	 to	 move	 on	 and	 find	 another	 place	 to	 sell	 his	 spoils.	 Perhaps	 he'd have	better	luck	in	the	inner	systems	of	the	Imperium;	the	frontier	systems	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	had	visited	so	far	had	been	almost	devoid	of	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	 the	 grand	 scheme	 of	 his	 chosen	 career	 he	 could	 be	 considered	 a	 petty</p>
<p class="calibre1">thief.	He	found	smuggling,	weapons	trading	and	gang	associations	too	much	like</p>
<p class="calibre1">hard	work,	and	there	were	too	many	risks	involved.	The	boarding	of	the	vessel</p>
<p class="calibre1">within	 Confederation	 space	 had	 been	 one	 of	 his	 biggest	 jobs	 in	 recent	 years, working	alongside	an	ad-hoc	group	of	others	he	had	met	in	a	dingy	bar	sometime</p>
<p class="calibre1">ago.	They	had	been	useless,	some	succeeding	in	getting	themselves	killed	even</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	boarding	the	ship.	He	had	decided	to	cut	his	losses	there	and	then,	putting</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	round	into	the	back	of	the	heads	of	the	survivors,	before	rigging	up	booby	traps</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	fleeing	with	what	he	could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	had	not	been	a	venture	he	had	enjoyed;	not	something	he	was	used	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead	he	preferred	to	focus	on	the	things	that	were	easiest	to	carry	and	dispose</p>
<p class="calibre1">of,	 mostly	 stealing	 to	 order.	 The	 trades	 were	 quick,	 for	 the	 most	 part	 effortless and	 low-key.	 Starports	 were	 his	 greatest	 outlet,	 travellers	 and	 entrepreneurs</p>
<p class="calibre1">being	his	best	customers.	Today,	however,	Arlos	had	been	a	waste	of	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 started	 back	 toward	 the	 docking	 port	 he	 had	 left	 his	 ship	 in,	 with	 the intention	of	heading	to	the	nearest	jumpgate	and	departing	the	system	for	greener</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	more	lucrative	pastures.	Although,	for	some	reason	he	was	having	difficulty</p>
<p class="calibre1">making	 headway	 deeper	 into	 Imperial	 space.	 The	 navigation	 buoys	 were	 oddly</p>
<p class="calibre1">reluctant	to	provide	him	with	the	necessary	data.	He	would	dig	through	his	ship's</p>
<p class="calibre1">databanks	 and	 see	 if	 the	 previous	 owner,	 from	 whom	 he	 had	 so	 violently</p>
<p class="calibre1">separated	it,	could	be	of	any	more	help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Glancing	 over	 his	 shoulder,	 he	 noticed	 that	 his	 pursuer	 had	 also	 risen	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	once	again	tailing	him,	although	not	as	subtly	this	time	as	before.	It	was	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 first	 time	 he	 had	 been	 followed	 when	 he	 was	 trading,	 but	 judging	 from	 the way	the	woman	had	kept	her	distance	and	her	profile	low,	she	was	not	one	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">usual	suspects.	At	first,	he	had	thought	her	to	be	in	the	same	line	of	work	as	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was,	himself:	some	found	it	easier	to	let	someone	like	him	do	all	the	hard	work</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	then	pounce	on	them	in	the	middle	of	a	transaction,	relieving	them	of	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">hard-earned	goods.	Parasites;	he	hated	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 this	 woman	 was	 far	 too	 cautious	 for	 that.	 He	 had	 dismissed	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">possibility	that	she	was	a	bounty	hunter,	chasing	the	reward	money	for	either	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">head	 or	 something	 he	 had	 stolen	 from	 the	 wrong	 person.	 If	 she	 had	 been,	 then the	 pursuit	 would	 not	 have	 been	 such	 a	 slow,	 quiet	 affair	 -	 more	 noisy,	 violent and	 very	 quick.	 No,	 this	 was	 a	 new	 one	 to	 him	 and	 he	 could	 make	 few</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p218"></a>assumptions;	 though	 one	 thing	 he	 knew	 he	 could	 be	 certain	 of	 was	 that	 the woman	had	decided	it	was	time	to	come	out	of	hiding	and	was	about	to	move	in</p>

<p class="calibre1">Clare	Barber	swept	between	the	groups	of	people	settled	on	the	floor	around	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 watched	 her	 step	 as	 she	 did	 so,	 though	 she	 did	 not	 take	 her	 eyes	 off	 her target,	who	walked	now	with	a	greater	purpose	than	just	the	wish	to	sell	his	haul</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	leave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	still	had	the	card,	though.	She	had	heard	him	enquire	a	couple	of	times</p>

<p class="calibre1">They	weren't,	of	course;	these	people	only	wanted	to	get	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	seemed	to	her	that	the	man	was	either	far	too	ignorant	or	far	too	arrogant</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	appreciate	the	terrible	fate	that	had	befallen	the	Imperium,	and	so	it	had	come</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 little	 surprise	 to	 her	 that	 he	 was	 having	 difficulties	 in	 offloading	 his	 stock here.	 She	 thought	 it	 likely	 that	 he	 had,	 until	 sometime	 ago,	 only	 operated	 in Confederation	and	Independent	World	star	systems,	returning	to	Imperial	space</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	after	attracting	too	much	attention	and	needing	to	disappear	for	a	while.	If</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 was	 the	 case,	 he	 was	 not	 having	 much	 luck	 escaping	 unwanted	 attention</p>
<p class="calibre1">here,	either. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Her	finger	clicked	the	safety	off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	turned	around,	his	and	Barber's	eyes	meeting	for	the	first	time,	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">scowl	telling	her	that	he	was	not	happy	with	being	followed.	Many	scars	covered</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	face,	showing	many	permanent	reminders	of	the	cost	of	his	chosen	lifestyle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 eyes	 seemed	 to	 tell	 terrible	 stories	 of	 all	 he	 had	 butchered	 whilst	 in	 the pursuit	 of	 that	 path.	 He	 presented	 a	 look	 that	 would	 have	 had	 many	 hastily reaching	 for	 their	 valuables,	 rather	 than	 incurring	 the	 pain	 and	 violence</p>
<p class="calibre1">promised.	Barber	was	immune:	she	had	seen	many	more	terrible	things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 sighed	 audibly	 before	 speaking.	 “&lt;You've	 been	 following	 me	 all	 day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Did	you	want	to	buy	anything	or	is	there	something	else	I	can	do	for	you?&gt;”	His</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice	 was	 calm	 and	 smooth,	 his	 eyes	 still	 locked	 on	 Barber's.	 He	 was	 playing with	her,	trying	to	throw	her	into	a	false	sense	of	security,	pretending	that	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 as	 threatening	 and	 dangerous	 as	 his	 looks	 might	 suggest,	 giving	 her	 the chance	to	walk	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p219"></a>Though	 the	 man	 spoke	 in	 an	 Imperial	 dialect,	 Barber	 knew	 that	 he	 would understand	 everything	 she	 had	 to	 say	 to	 him.	 “You	 are	 carrying	 something	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">want,”	she	said,	with	equal	calm.	The	pistol	she	gripped	emerged	from	between</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	folds	of	the	blanket	that	still	enclosed	her	and	she	pointed	it	casually	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">man's	 chest.	 “Hand	 over	 the	 data	 card.	 Nothing	 else,	 just	 the	 card.	 And	 do	 it slowly.”	Her	other	hand	slipped	the	blanket	from	her	shoulders,	letting	it	fall	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	floor	behind	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though	she	had	her	pistol	in	her	hand,	she	was	not	about	to	approach	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">frisk	the	man	herself.	Her	experience	with	people	such	as	this	raider	had	taught</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	 that	 they	 could	 be	 slippery	 characters,	 unpredictable	 and	 desperate,	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">either	very	cunning	or	very	stupid.	It	mattered	little	to	Barber	which	of	those	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">might	 be,	 since,	 no	 matter	 what,	 she	 could	 be	 certain	 he	 would	 be	 very</p>
<p class="calibre1">dangerous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	sight	of	the	pistol,	people	close	to	the	pair	started	shifting,	shuffling</p>
<p class="calibre1">backward	 and	 clamouring	 to	 stand	 and	 escape	 the	 scene	 that	 was	 unfolding</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	 them.	 Despite	 the	 sudden	 goings-on	 about	 her,	 Barber	 did	 not	 take	 her eyes	off	her	target. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 man	 sneered,	 watching	 the	 people	 gathering	 up	 their	 belongings	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying	to	get	loved	ones	to	move	out	of	the	immediate	area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barber's	 face	 remained	 stern.	 “I	 won't	 ask	 you	 again,”	 she	 warned.	 She</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 have	 shot	 him	 hours	 ago,	 but	 had	 refrained	 from	 doing	 so	 in	 case	 of	 a defensive	knee-jerk	reaction	from	one	of	those	assembled	in	the	immediate	area, </p>
<p class="calibre1">leading	to	her	own	death.	She	could	no	longer	risk	that	the	man	might	get	away, </p>
<p class="calibre1">though,	and	had	taken	the	decision	to	confront	him	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	raider's	eyes	widened,	but	his	sneer	remained.	“Well,	if	you	want	it	so</p>
<p class="calibre1">badly,	why	don't	you	just	come	over	here	and	take	it?”	he	replied,	reverting	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">dialect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barber	 straightened	 her	 arm,	 training	 the	 gun	 on	 the	 man's	 head, </p>
<p class="calibre1">emphasising	her	point.	The	man's	sneer	disappeared,	his	face	becoming	serious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	reached	into	the	coat	he	wore,	his	hand	fumbling	around	in	an	inside	pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barber	 tensed,	 anticipating	 the	 glint	 of	 a	 firearm	 and	 the	 need	 for	 her	 to react.	 The	 raider	 removed	 something	 and	 threw	 it	 at	 her	 feet,	 though	 it	 did	 not make	the	noise	she	was	expecting:	much	louder	and	clunkier,	and	with	a	metallic</p>
<p class="calibre1">clasping	 sound.	 The	 gasps	 and	 sudden	 cries	 about	 her	 confirmed	 her	 worries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 took	 her	 eyes	 off	 the	 man	 for	 just	 a	 moment	 to	 see,	 resting	 a	 little	 way	 in front	 of	 her,	 a	 tiny,	 flat	 octagonal	 device.	 A	 red	 light	 winked	 on	 the	 top	 of	 its dark	grey	surface,	steadily	growing	faster	and	faster.	It	was	a	mini-mine,	and	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	about	to	explode. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barber	ran	back,	trying	to	keep	an	eye	on	the	man	as	the	device	went	off, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p220"></a>fire,	flames	and	smoke	obscuring	her	vision.	Through	the	haze	she	sighted	him, sprinting	 between	 the	 packs	 of	 people	 crowded	 together	 on	 the	 floor.	 Ignoring the	 screams	 of	 terror	 around	 her,	 Barber	 began	 a	 much	 more	 urgent	 pursuit	 of her	target.	The	raider	was	fast,	darting	between	groups	and	huddles,	and	hopping</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	bags,	but	Barber	had	few	problems	in	keeping	up.	She	kept	a	tight	grip	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	pistol	as	she	ran,	stopping	every	now	and	again	to	loose	off	a	shot,	none	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">which	found	their	mark.	The	long	coat	the	man	wore	flapped	around	as	he	zig-</p>
<p class="calibre1">zagged,	 ducked	 and	 leapt	 about,	 concealing	 his	 form	 from	 her	 and	 making	 it</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	harder	to	know	where	to	shoot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 chased	 him	 for	 sometime	 and	 soon	 had	 him	 cornered,	 the	 exit	 he	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 making	 for	 unexpectedly	 closed.	 Barber	 had	 seen	 to	 that	 when	 she	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">followed	him	in,	intending	on	minimising	possible	escape	routes.	He	hammered</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	the	button	next	to	the	exit,	but	it	refused	to	open.	She	levelled	her	gun	at	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">torso	as	he	tried	in	vain	to	prise	the	door	open	where	it	met	the	wall,	his	fingers</p>
<p class="calibre1">struggling	to	find	anything	to	latch	on	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barber	 had	 chosen	 a	 non-energy	 weapon	 for	 this	 assignment.	 Though	 an</p>
<p class="calibre1">energy	 weapon	 was	 more	 effective,	 within	 the	 context	 of	 this	 fight	 it	 could destroy	 the	 data	 card	 she	 was	 after.	 Whilst	 she	 was	 aware	 that	 the	 impact	 of	 a bullet	 could	 also	 damage	 or	 destroy	 the	 card,	 the	 high	 amounts	 of	 energy</p>
<p class="calibre1">dissipated	by	the	impact	of	a	plasma	or	other	energy	shot	could	cause	destruction</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	proximity.	And	bullets	served	Barber's	requirements	just	as	well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 the	 last	 second,	 just	 as	 Barber	 squeezed	 the	 trigger,	 the	 raider	 ducked</p>
<p class="calibre1">along	the	side	of	the	adjoining	wall,	and	the	shot	that	had	been	intended	for	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">heart	 slammed	 instead	 into	 his	 left	 shoulder.	 Barber	 fired	 once	 again,	 but	 with the	raider	still	ducking	the	shot	missed	altogether,	ripping	through	his	coat	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">ricochetting	 off	 against	 the	 wall	 behind	 him.	 The	 third	 squeeze	 clicked	 on	 an empty	 chamber,	 the	 tiny	 digital	 counter	 on	 the	 top	 of	 the	 weapon	 flashing	 two zeroes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bitch!	I'll	kill	you!”	her	quarry	cried	out	with	a	mixture	of	pain	and	anger, </p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 right	 hand	 clasped	 around	 his	 bleeding	 shoulder.	 Barber	 saw	 him	 swing</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	and	aim	his	own	weapon.	It	looked	like	a	laser	pistol. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barber	 ducked	 down	 close	 to	 an	 assembled	 family,	 who	 panicked	 at	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sudden	 realisation	 they	 were	 now	 in	 the	 line	 of	 fire.	 The	 raider	 appeared	 to	 be left-handed,	 or	 at	 least	 held	 the	 weapon	 with	 his	 left,	 and	 with	 his	 shoulder wounded	 his	 aim	 was	 far	 from	 true.	 The	 first	 shot	 cleanly	 missed	 its	 intended target,	 as	 well	 as	 everything	 else,	 the	 thin	 red	 beam	 striking	 the	 floor	 behind Barber,	letting	off	sparks	and	leaving	a	scorch	mark	at	the	point	of	impact.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">second	 and	 third	 shots	 found	 targets,	 neither	 of	 which	 were	 Barber.	 The	 first felled	 a	 man,	 hitting	 him	 square	 in	 the	 forehead.	 The	 beam	 passed	 straight</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p221"></a>through	his	skull,	leaving	a	small	hole	in	the	front	and	back	of	his	head	before striking	 the	 ground	 behind.	 The	 second	 struck	 a	 mother	 in	 the	 hand	 as	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1">reached	across	to	grab	her	daughter,	and	the	little	girl	screamed	in	horror	as	three</p>
<p class="calibre1">severed	fingers	fell	into	her	lap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following	 his	 unsuccessful	 attempts	 to	 down	 his	 target,	 the	 raider	 lunged</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward	with	his	outstretched	right	hand,	and	yanked	a	young	woman	up	off	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">floor	by	her	long	hair,	just	as	Barber	prepared	to	raise	her	gun	once	more.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	 held	 the	 screaming	 woman	 in	 front	 of	 himself,	 shaking	 her	 head	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">shouting	 at	 her	 in	 the	 Imperial	 dialect	 he	 had	 spoken	 to	 Barber	 in.	 At	 first,	 he placed	his	gun	against	the	woman's	temple,	before	he	lowered	his	quivering	arm</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	rested	it	across	her	shoulder	for	support. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barber	felt	no	pity	for	the	dead	man	or	maimed	woman,	they	were	nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	to	her	than	collateral	damage.	However,	to	shoot	the	innocent	woman	held</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 the	 raider	 as	 a	 human	 shield	 went	 against	 her	 code	 of	 conduct	 and	 her	 own moral	 values.	 Even	 though	 the	 Confederacy	 had	 pressed	 upon	 her	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tremendous	 importance	 of	 the	 data	 card	 she	 was	 after,	 there	 were	 some	 things she	refused	to	do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	raider	began	walking	away,	keeping	parallel	with	the	wall	behind	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	the	girl	continued	to	sob	with	fear	and	plead	with	her	captor.	He	kept	an	eye</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 Barber	 the	 whole	 time,	 his	 laser	 pistol	 pointed	 over	 the	 shoulder	 of	 his hostage.	Barber	sidestepped	in	his	direction,	keeping	up	with	his	pace,	her	own</p>
<p class="calibre1">gun	trained	on	him	the	whole	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Why	 isn't	 he	 firing? </i>	 Barber	 wondered.  <i class="calibre4">Is	 he	 low	 on	 ammo?	 Has	 his	 laser</i> <i class="calibre4">pistol	overheated? </i>	The	man	was	in	a	far	better	position	to	attack	than	she	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	three	continued	with	their	steady	stepping	dance	for	a	while,	the	raider</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeking	to	move	himself	into	a	more	strategic	position	from	where	he	could	flee</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	next	docking	port	exit.	He	made	occasional	snap	glances	around,	to	ensure</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 was	 not	 going	 to	 trip	 over	 items	 that	 were	 scattered	 about.	 But	 as	 Barber already	 knew,	 his	 current	 location	 was	 not	 going	 to	 permit	 him	 an	 easy	 escape route	 and	 it	 could	 be	 seen	 that	 he	 was	 losing	 patience	 with	 the	 girl	 he	 was dragging	along.	His	wounded	shoulder	was	also	making	it	more	difficult	for	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	keep	his	arm	straight,	despite	being	able	to	rest	it	across	the	terrified	woman's</p>
<p class="calibre1">shoulder.	Barber	maintained	a	relaxed	demeanour,	following	his	every	step. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 raider	 suddenly	 cast	 aside	 his	 hostage	 and	 began	 to	 run,	 making	 no</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempt	to	shoot.	Barber	swore	as	she	started	after	him.	His	gun	had	been	empty</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	whole	time;	he	had	been	bluffing.	And	Barber	had	been	doing	just	the	same</p>
<p class="calibre1">thing.	 Neither	 of	 them	 had	 found	 the	 time	 to	 reload	 their	 weapons	 and	 neither wanted	to	give	the	other	the	advantage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Barber	 broke	 into	 a	 run	 to	 catch	 up	 with	 the	 raider,	 who	 was	 once	 again</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p222"></a>darting	and	skipping	over	people.	He	was	not	heading	in	any	specific	direction, but	 zig-zagging	 once	 more.	 Barber	 saw	 him	 fumbling	 around	 in	 his	 coat	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">assumed	 he	 was	 trying	 to	 buy	 himself	 some	 time	 as	 he	 searched	 for	 an	 energy capsule	 to	 recharge	 his	 laser	 pistol.	 With	 the	 huge	 scatters	 of	 people	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">baggage,	coupled	with	the	urgency	of	the	raider	to	reload	his	gun,	Barber	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">see	it	would	not	be	long	before	he	came	undone. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>

<p class="calibre1">As	 Sullivan	 leapt	 over	 a	 bag,	 his	 foot	 became	 caught	 within	 an	 exposed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">unturned	 strap,	 the	 sudden	 and	 unexpected	 additional	 weight	 causing	 him	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">topple	 forward	 and	 crash	 to	 the	 ground.	 His	 laser	 pistol	 and	 the	 energy	 cap	 he had	only	just	managed	to	pull	from	his	coat	clattered	and	skidded	along	the	floor</p>
<p class="calibre1">ahead	of	him,	far	out	of	reach.	He	thrashed	his	foot	around	in	a	vain	attempt	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">free	himself,	not	wanting	to	take	his	eyes	off	his	gun,	though	the	struggling	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	no	good.	He	looked	around	at	the	problem,	and	his	hands	flew	towards	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">straps	 that	 were	 curled	 around	 his	 ankle.	 His	 coat	 was	 equipped	 with	 a	 knife, built	into	one	sleeve,	and	with	a	quick	flick	of	his	wrist	it	shot	free	and	into	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand.	It	was	exceptionally	sharp,	and	with	just	a	few	slashes	he	managed	to	cut</p>

<p class="calibre1">Free	 once	 more,	 he	 leapt	 to	 his	 feet,	 just	 in	 time	 to	 see	 his	 pursuer</p>

<p class="calibre1">square	in	the	chest.	Sullivan	grunted	as	the	bullet	slammed	into	him,	but	despite</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	searing	pain	he	still	had	a	lot	of	fight	left	in	him.	He	responded	to	her	attack</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	driving	his	knife	into	her	own	chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah?!	See	how	you	like	it,	bitch!”	he	spat.	The	woman	cried	out	in	pain, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	even	before	she	had	time	to	act	Sullivan	gripped	her	tight	about	the	shoulder, </p>
<p class="calibre1">withdrew	 the	 knife	 and	 plunged	 it	 twice	 more	 into	 her.	 Just	 as	 he	 prepared	 to strike	 for	 the	 fourth	 time,	 he	 heard	 several	 bangs	 and	 the	 remainder	 of	 his attacker's	clip	tore	into	his	belly.	He	struggled	to	breathe,	but	could	draw	no	air</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	his	lungs.	He	held	fast	to	his	knife,	even	as	his	vision	blurred. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The	 raider	 sagged,	 his	 grip	 on	 Barber	 loosening	 as	 he	 fell	 to	 the	 floor.	 Barber</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p223"></a>could	feel	her	own	legs	beginning	to	give	way	and	she	fought	to	control	herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	raider	lay	dead	on	the	floor	before	her,	she	rummaged	through	his	clothes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 prayed	 that	 he	 had	 the	 data	 card	 with	 him,	 rather	 than	 having	 left	 it	 in	 his craft.

<p class="calibre1">run	down	her	chin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Relief	 washed	 over	 her	 as	 her	 fingers	 encountered	 a	 thin	 piece	 of	 plastic</p>
<p class="calibre1">which,	once	removed,	revealed	itself	to	be	just	what	she	had	been	looking	for:	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">tiny,	 thin	 blue	 card,	 bearing	 the	 Confederation	 insignia.	 Her	 head	 began	 to	 feel light	and	she	sat	down	on	the	floor	with	a	heavy	thump,	using	one	hand	to	prop</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself	up	and	keep	from	tipping	over	completely.	There	was	very	little	time	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">act.	She	knew	what	she	had	to	do	and,	reaching	into	her	jacket,	she	removed	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">packet	containing	a	tiny	capsule	and	a	small	bottle	of	liquid.	Breaking	open	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">packet,	she	placed	the	data	card	into	the	capsule	and	sealed	it	tight.	She	coughed</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	more,	feeling	the	blood	fill	her	mouth	again	and	the	taste	of	iron	with	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	spat	it	from	her	mouth,	as	well	as	the	rest	that	wanted	to	follow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 took	 her	 some	 time	 and	 considerable	 effort	 for	 her	 to	 achieve	 what	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 planned	 for	 the	 card,	 but	 eventually	 she	 succeeded.	 Drawing	 heavy, </p>
<p class="calibre1">staggered	breaths,	but	confident	that	the	plans	were	now	in	a	safe	place,	she	lay</p>
<p class="calibre1">back.	 She	 was	 going	 to	 die.	 She	 found	 her	 breath	 coming	 shorter	 with	 each</p>

<p class="calibre1">together	 in	 a	 pool	 of	 blood,	 following	 their	 very	 violent	 encounter.	 She	 met another	woman's	eyes	and	saw	them	filled	with	pity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 hope	 you're	 luckier	 than	 I	 was,”	 she	 whispered.	 But	 in	 her	 heart	 she</p>

<p class="calibre1">—	<b class="calibre3">An	Uncomfortable	Revelation	—</b></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">O</b>ver	time,	the	grey	form	of	Arlos	loomed	steadily	larger	as	the	ATAFs	hurtled</p>
<p class="calibre1">towards	it,	hidden	from	all	but	the	most	diligent	observer	beneath	the	veil	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">starfighter's	 cloaking	 device.	 Owing	 to	 the	 direction	 of	 their	 approach,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">starport	was	obscured	from	the	 <i class="calibre4">White	Knights</i>	behind	the	far	side	of	Arlos;	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 he	 rounded	 the	 dull	 planet,	 Dodds	 expected	 to	 see	 a	 flurry	 of	 activity	 from their	dodecahedral-shaped	destination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Contrary	to	his	expectation,	the	starport	was	quiet	and	appeared	to	be	all	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">abandoned.	 The	 normal	 glow	 of	 lights	 and	 other	 illuminations	 that	 would	 have welcomed	travels	were	absent,	the	port's	lifelessness	echoing	that	of	the	rest	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	star	system.	He	got	the	feeling	that	the	port	wished	to	convey	the	impression</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 it	 had	 been	 out	 of	 use	 for	 quite	 sometime,	 its	 previous	 residents	 having upped	and	left	many	years	ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	the	second	time	in	almost	as	many	days	that	Dodds'	destination	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">presented	 him	 with	 a	 cold	 and	 dead	 demeanour,	 and	 it	 was	 a	 theme	 that	 was starting	to	become	all	too	common.	The	only	indication	that	the	port	was	not	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">dead	and	lifeless	as	it	would	have	had	one	believe	was	the	presence	of	a	solitary</p>
<p class="calibre1">cargo	vessel	resting	near	by;	though	it	too	was	shrouded	in	darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Think	 anyone's	 home?”	 Dodds	 asked	 of	 his	 companions	 as	 they	 came</p>
<p class="calibre1">closer	to	their	destination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks	abandoned,”	Enrique	said.	“Either	that	or	our	friend	has	been	busy</p>
<p class="calibre1">here,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Estelle,	are	we	in	the	right	place?”	Dodds	said	with	genuine	uncertainty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“These	are	the	coordinates	that	Commodore	Parks	gave	us,”	Estelle	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds'	 eyes	 flickered	 over	 the	 surface	 of	 the	 port.	 Under	 normal</p>
<p class="calibre1">circumstances,	a	starport	would	be	a	hive	of	activity,	its	presence	advertised	far</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	wide	by	the	constant	flow	of	traffic	to	and	from	it.	Mining	vessels,	transport</p>
<p class="calibre1">ships	 of	 various	 shapes	 and	 sizes	 would	 be	 docked	 in	 and	 around	 the	 port, </p>
<p class="calibre1">dropping	 off	 passengers,	 cargo	 and	 spoils.	 Even	 without	 the	 heavy	 flow	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p225"></a>traffic,	 the	 port	 could	 be	 spotted	 from	 a	 long	 way	 off,	 the	 bright	 multicoloured lights	 guiding	 people	 home.	 All	 that	 was	 gone	 now,	 cold,	 uninviting	 grey	 steel the	only	thing	remaining	to	greet	visitors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I've	just	scanned	for	a	possible	means	of	entry,”	came	Chaz's	voice.	“But	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">appears	 all	 docking	 ports	 have	 been	 sealed.	 Looks	 like	 we're	 going	 to	 have	 to find	another	way	inside.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We'll	 have	 to	 use	 an	 airlock,”	 Estelle	 said.	 “Which	 means	 we'll	 have	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">leave	the	ATAFs	outside	the	port.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We're	just	going	to	leave	them	floating	here?”	Dodds	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	don't	have	much	choice	in	the	matter.	As	Commodore	Parks	instructed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">we'll	keep	them	cloaked	whilst	we	retrieve	the	data	from	the	agent.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure.	 And	 then	 we'll	 just	 fumble	 about	 in	 empty	 space	 looking	 for	 them</p>
<p class="calibre1">when	we	come	back	out,”	Dodds	said	sarcastically.	He	could	see	no	clear	avenue</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	how	they	were	supposed	to	get	back	into	the	ATAFs	once	they	had	left	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since	they	were	invisible,	the	 <i class="calibre4">White	Knights</i>	would	have	to	grasp	around	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">starfighter's	general	area	and	try	and	feel	their	way	back	in	the	cockpit.	But	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	take	hours,	maybe	even	days.	Maybe	even	longer.	Dodds	hoped	that	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	not	be	in	a	hurry.	Taking	any	sort	of	mobile	sensor	device	with	them	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 an	 option,	 either.	 Whilst	 the	 ATAFs'	 radars	 themselves	 displayed	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">positions	of	the	other	fighters,	cloaked	or	not,	they	were	not	removable	from	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">craft. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We'll	have	to	turn	the	cloak	off...”	Dodds	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">No</i>,	 Dodds,”	 Estelle	 said.	 “We	 were	 given	 very	 specific	 orders	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1">Commodore	Parks	not	to	deactivate	the	cloak	for	any	reason.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	said	nothing	else	on	the	subject,	sensing	that	Estelle	was	still	upset</p>
<p class="calibre1">after	being	chewed	out	by	the	commodore,	despite	averting	 <i class="calibre4">Operation	Menelaus</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">from	becoming	one	of	the	greatest	naval	catastrophes	in	recent	history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One	of	us	will	have	to	remain	out	here,	then,”	Enrique	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No-one	 is	 staying	 out	 here	 alone,”	 Estelle	 said.	 “I	 want	 everyone	 to	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	I	can	see	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We'll	 have	 to	 find	 some	 way	 of	 returning	 to	 the	 ATAFs	 once	 we	 leave</p>
<p class="calibre1">them,	then,”	Enrique	responded.	“Otherwise	we	might	never	find	them	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	we	leave	them	next	to	that	freighter	it'll	be	a	lot	easier	to	locate	them,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly	chirped	up.	“We'll	have	a	better	point	of	reference.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	 a	 good	 idea,	 Kelly,”	 Estelle	 said.	 “Okay	 people,	 let's	 form	 a	 line</p>
<p class="calibre1">close	 to	 the	 freighter	 and	 disembark.	 Once	 you're	 out,	 make	 your	 way	 over	 to me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 others	 acknowledged	 her	 order	 and	 guided	 the	 ATAFs	 close	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">freighter,	watching	their	radars	and	HUD	so	as	not	to	collide	with	one	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p226"></a>Bringing	 his	 ATAF	 to	 a	 stop,	 Dodds	 informed	 the	 others	 he	 was disembarking.	 He	 reached	 under	 the	 fighter's	 seat	 and	 pulled	 out	 a	 small</p>
<p class="calibre1">propulsion	pack	that	resided	beneath.	The	pack	was	a	standard	feature	of	all	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">CSN's	starfighters,	though	it	was	only	of	any	real	use	to	the	pilot	during	events</p>
<p class="calibre1">such	 as	 ejections.	 Dodds	 had	 received	 training	 in	 the	 usage	 and	 general</p>
<p class="calibre1">application	 of	 the	 pack,	 but	 he	 had	 never	 found	 the	 need	 to	 use	 it,	 himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ensuring	his	helmet	and	flight	suit	were	securely	set	up	and	fastened,	he	opened</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 canopy.	 He	 unbuckled	 himself	 from	 his	 seat	 and,	 taking	 a	 good	 grip	 of	 his propulsion	pack,	let	himself	drift	out	into	the	vacuum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	flight	suit	was	well	insulated	against	the	cold	of	outer	space	and	upon</p>
<p class="calibre1">leaving	 the	 ATAF	 he	 experienced	 nothing	 more	 than	 the	 sensation	 of	 free</p>
<p class="calibre1">movement	 within	 the	 vacuum.	 Dodds	 started	 slipping	 his	 propulsion	 pack	 onto</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	back	and,	looking	around,	saw	Enrique	making	his	way	from	his	own	ATAF. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	a	bizarre	sight	to	behold:	from	the	middle	of	nowhere	a	helmet	emerged, </p>
<p class="calibre1">followed	 by	 shoulders,	 a	 body,	 legs,	 and	 then	 feet.	 It	 was	 as	 if	 a	 magical	 door had	opened	and	his	friend	had	just	slipped	out	of	it.	His	pack	on,	he	watched	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 others	 left	 their	 ATAFs,	 before	 Estelle's	 voice	 sounded	 in	 his	 helmet's</p>
<p class="calibre1">speaker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Over	this	way,	people,”	she	requested,	raising	her	hand.	She	was	waiting	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	further	up	the	side	of	the	freighter	and	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	began	to	make	their	way over	to	her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We'll	 make	 our	 way	 to	 the	 port	 and	 look	 for	 an	 airlock,	 so	 we	 can	 get</p>
<p class="calibre1">inside,”	Estelle	informed	her	team,	once	everyone	had	made	it	over.	“Follow	my</p>
<p class="calibre1">lead.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">As	 she	 moved	 further	 away	 from	 the	 freighter,	 Kelly	 took	 a	 look	 back.	 During their	 approach,	 Kelly	 had	 stared	 at	 the	 vessel,	 very	 certain	 that	 she	 had	 seen	 it before;	 or	 perhaps	 the	 blow	 to	 her	 head	 was	 making	 her	 see	 things	 again.	 She had	 then	 scanned	 the	 ship	 with	 her	 ATAF's	 targeting	 systems	 and	 the	 resulting readouts	 had	 once	 again	 made	 her	 question	 her	 own	 sanity.	 Given	 the	 lack	 of comment	from	her	wingmates,	the	others	had	not	noticed	what	she	had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In	large	eroded	and	rusted	orange	letters	along	the	central	container	was	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">name	 of	 the	 ship,	 “<i class="calibre4">La	 Brabena	 Bella</i>”,	 and	 underneath	 it	 in	 much	 smaller lettering,	 “Gloucester	 Enterprises”.	 The	 lettering	 was	 well-worn,	 barely	 legible with	little	more	than	the	outline	remaining;	but	it	was	readable	if	one	knew	what</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p227"></a>they	were	looking	for. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gloucester	 Enterprises,	 one	 of	 the	 galaxy's	 most	 successful	 trading</p>
<p class="calibre1">companies,	was	owned	by	Kelly's	family.	This	was	one	of	her	father's	ships.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	thought	it	looked	familiar	when	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	had	first	approached	it,	and	her fighter's	 computer	 had	 confirmed	 the	 ship's	 configuration.	 The	 vessel	 had	 been designated	a	new	name	(“<i class="calibre4">The	Mayflower</i>”)	and	universal	identity	signature,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">there	 was	 no	 chance	 of	 disguising	 its	 distinctive	 appearance	 from	 Kelly.	 The body	was	segmented	into	three	main	parts,	like	a	rigid	snake	that	had	swallowed</p>
<p class="calibre1">three	large	rectangular	boxes.	The	lick	of	dark	red	paint	was	also	something	of	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">giveaway. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">What's	 it	 doing	 here,	 all	 the	 way	 out	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 nowhere? </i>	 Kelly wondered.	 Despite	 its	 success	 and	 reputation	 throughout	 Confederate	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Independent	systems,	the	Imperium	had	never	granted	Gloucester	Enterprises	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">trading	permit;	the	Senate	had	seen	to	that.	It	was	unlikely	to	have	been	stolen, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	she	knew	the	company	removed	all	affiliated	branding	before	selling	off	old</p>
<p class="calibre1">ships.	Something	about	its	presence	here	did	not	add	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 lingered	 for	 a	 while,	 staring	 at	 it,	 contemplating	 a	 number	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">explanations.	 She	 was	 about	 to	 say	 something	 to	 the	 others	 when	 her	 eye	 was caught	 by	 something	 else:	 portholes	 and	 windows	 dotted	 the	 length	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">freighter	at	various	points	and	from	out	of	one	of	the	windows	a	small	face	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">staring	back	at	her.	As	Kelly	squinted,	it	remained	there,	transfixed,	gazing	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 her	 in	 wrapped,	 abject	 horror.	 It	 was	 the	 grubby-looking	 face	 of	 a	 little	 girl, long,	 unkempt	 dirty	 blonde	 hair	 dangling	 down	 around	 her	 head.	 Her	 mouth</p>
<p class="calibre1">hung	 open,	 as	 if	 she	 had	 just	 made	 a	 great	 intake	 of	 breath	 and	 was	 now	 too scared	to	make	any	other	noise	or	movement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly	 prepared	 to	 start	 forward	 to	 the	 window	 when	 a	 new	 face	 appeared</p>
<p class="calibre1">alongside	 the	 child.	 It	 turned	 to	 glance	 at	 Kelly	 before	 it	 and	 the	 little	 girl vanished	 from	 sight.	 From	 what	 Kelly	 caught,	 it	 looked	 like	 an	 older	 woman, perhaps	 the	 girl's	 mother,	 who	 had	 come	 to	 move	 the	 child	 away	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">window.	From	the	looks	of	things,	they	were	trying	to	conceal	their	presence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	surprise	made	her	gasp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	up,	Kelly?”	Estelle's	voice	came	in	her	earpiece. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly	looked	around	to	see	the	others,	now	quite	some	way	from	her,	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">stopped	 their	 journey	 towards	 the	 port.	 Had	 she	 just	 imagined	 it?	 No,	 she</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn't	 have.	 The	 knock	 on	 her	 head	 did	 not	 appear	 to	 be	 doing	 her	 as	 much harm	as	she	thought;	after	all,	she	had	been	right	about	the	freighter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	just	saw	someone,”	Kelly	answered	Estelle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where?”	Estelle	asked,	the	three	men	next	to	her	looking	in	all	directions, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	if	expecting	to	see	a	body	swimming	through	space. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p228"></a>“In	the	freighter.	There	was	a	girl,	and	a	woman,	in	one	of	the	windows.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silence	from	the	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And?”	It	was	Dodds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	 one	 of	 my	 father's	 ships,”	 Kelly	 insisted.	 “And	 they	 don't	 carry</p>
<p class="calibre1">passengers	 -	 it's	 a	 freighter.”	 Kelly	 saw	 that	 all	 four	 of	 her	 team	 mates	 were staring	 in	 her	 direction.	 She	 guessed	 that	 they	 were	 peering	 past	 her	 at	 the window,	scrutinizing	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 don't	 see	 anyone,”	 Estelle	 said	 eventually.	 “Are	 you	 certain	 you	 saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	hesitated.	“Pretty	sure.	They	didn't	stay	there	long.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	wait.	What's	one	of	your	dad's	ships	doing	out	here?”	Enrique	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	doesn't	sound	right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	what	I've	been	saying,”	Kelly	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly	heard	Estelle	let	out	a	tetchy	sigh,	then,	“Look,	we	don't	have	time	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">this.	Kelly,	did	they	look	dangerous?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	they	just	looked	like	civilians,”	Kelly	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	mumbled	something	offensive	under	her	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,	that's	all	we	need	to	know.	Now,	get	a	move	on	and	try	to	keep	up,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly	tore	herself	away	from	the	window	and	started	back	towards	the	rest</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	group. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 need	 to	 find	 a	 way	 inside.	 A	 service	 hatch	 or	 an	 airlock,”	 Estelle	 told	 the group	as	they	arrived	next	to	the	port's	outer	surface.	“Spread	out	and	see	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	can	find.	Call	in	if	you	get	into	any	trouble.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even	up	close	and	personal,	the	port	was	nothing	but	a	mass	of	grey	steel</p>
<p class="calibre1">plates,	the	occasional	warning	sign	or	instructional	panel	adding	a	tiny	splash	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">colour	to	the	otherwise	dull	surface.	The	group	set	about	on	a	fruitless	search	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	while,	discovering	hatches	and	doors,	none	of	which	could	be	opened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Found	one,”	Dodds	eventually	reported	as	he	checked	out	a	door	close	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 main	 docking	 entrance	 to	 the	 port.	 Unlike	 the	 others,	 it	 was	 not	 security locked.	 He	 pulled	 it	 open	 as	 the	 rest	 of	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	 regrouped	 and	 joined	 him inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 the	 outer	 door	 sealed	 behind	 them,	 Dodds	 took	 a	 look	 at	 the	 control</p>
<p class="calibre1">panel	inside	the	chamber	and	managed	to	re-pressurise	it.	He	gratefully	removed</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p229"></a>his	helmet	and	breathed	in	the	air	that	now	flowed	into	the	small	room.	He	then worked	 the	 control	 panel	 some	 more,	 looking	 for	 a	 way	 to	 grant	 them	 further access	into	the	station.	The	inner	door	opened	and,	as	it	did	so,	the	group	found</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves	 standing	 in	 a	 narrow	 corridor.	 A	 number	 of	 men	 and	 women,	 sat</p>
<p class="calibre1">along	it,	looked	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	sudden	appearance	of	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	sent	a	ripple	of	shock	down	the	line</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	a	man	close	to	the	group	shot	to	his	feet,	screaming	in	terror.	He	stumbled</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	ran	down	the	corridor	as	fast	as	he	could,	pushing	aside	a	woman	who	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">also	trying	to	escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	the	hell	was	his	problem?	Did	we	spook	him	or	something?”	Dodds</p>
<p class="calibre1">said,	 as	 they	 watched	 the	 man	 who	 had	 leapt	 to	 his	 feet	 round	 a	 corner	 on	 his continuing	quest	to	escape	whatever	it	was	that	had	scared	him.	The	remainder</p>
<p class="calibre1">crawled	backwards	down	the	corridor,	eyes	fixed	on	the	five	people	that	had	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">entered	the	port,	terror	etched	into	all	their	faces.	It	was	as	if	they	had	just	seen</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	worst	nightmare	step	through	the	airlock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Beats	me.	Maybe	he	thinks	he	owes	Chaz	money,”	Enrique	said,	looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	at	the	big	man	with	amusement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	said	nothing,	his	face	stern	and	his	eyes	sweeping	over	the	groups	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">people.	“Let's	go,”	he	said,	pushing	the	others	gently	aside	and	starting	off	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 corridor.	 “We've	 got	 to	 find	 Barber,	 get	 that	 data	 card,	 and	 get	 back	 to <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 stunned	 Dodds	 watched	 him	 go.	 He	 exchanged	 a	 confused	 look	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle,	 who	 was	 wearing	 her	 own	 muddled	 expression.	 The	 people	 on	 either</p>
<p class="calibre1">sides	 of	 Chaz	 backed	 away	 as	 he	 passed	 them,	 the	 often	 silent	 man	 not	 giving them	a	second	glance.	Dodds,	Estelle	and	Kelly	looked	around	at	Enrique,	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	 look:	 he	 might	 talk	 to	 me	 more	 than	 anyone	 else,	 but	 that	 doesn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">mean	 that	 I	 know	 what	 goes	 on	 in	 that	 head	 of	 his,”	 Enrique	 said	 almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">inaudibly,	not	taking	his	eyes	off	the	big	man.	“Don't	go	expecting	me	to	provide</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	the	answers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Come	on,”	Estelle	said,	following	Chaz	down	the	corridor,	passing	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">people	who	were	now	trying	to	crush	themselves	into	the	walls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“&lt;Please	 don't	 hurt	 us,&gt;”	 a	 woman	 pleaded	 as	 she	 tried	 to	 move	 further back	than	the	wall	would	allow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	did	she	say?”	Dodds	asked	Enrique. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sounds	 like	 she	 was	 speaking	 some	 sort	 of	 Imperial,”	 Enrique	 said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">looking	at	the	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Either	 of	 you	 guys	 understand	 any	 Imperial	 dialects?”	 Dodds	 asked	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	and	Kelly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p230"></a>“Just	 ignore	 them,”	 Estelle	 said,	 striding	 around	 the	 corner	 and	 through	 a set	of	doors.	She	stopped	in	the	doorway,	where	Chaz	had	also	stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	walked	up	behind	the	pair	and	peered	around	them.	“Ah.	We	might</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	here	a	while.”	A	sea	of	people	lay	before	them,	occupying	almost	every	inch</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	floor	that	could	be	found. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	five	pilots	stepped	into	the	central	main	hall	of	the	starport,	many	heads</p>
<p class="calibre1">snapping	around	to	take	note	of	the	new	arrivals.	Dodds	noticed	that	the	 <i class="calibre4">White</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	received	the	same	reaction	from	the	groups	of	people	in	the	hall	as	they had	done	in	the	corridor,	with	many	of	those	close	by	pushing	themselves	further</p>
<p class="calibre1">back.	Some	sprang	to	their	feet	and	moved	away,	appearing	to	not	trust	the	new</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrivals.	 It	 was	 obvious	 that	 the	 man	 who	 had	 fled	 the	 corridor	 had	 passed through	here	already,	putting	everyone	on	edge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You're	 right,	 Dodds.	 Something's	 spooked	 these	 guys	 pretty	 bad,”	 Kelly</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	as	they	began	walking	aimlessly	between	the	huddles,	the	search	for	Barber</p>
<p class="calibre1">temporarily	forgotten.	The	people	gathered	about	did	not	take	their	fearful	eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	for	one	second. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	 this	 all	 about?”	 Dodds	 asked,	 looking	 all	 about	 the	 huddles	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">people.	“Are	they	all	waiting	for	transit	or	something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	 and	 what's	 with	 all	 the	 bags?	 They	 look	 like	 refugees...”	 Enrique</p>
<p class="calibre1">said.	He	stopped	walking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	stopped	and	turned	to	him.	“Just	like	that	guy	said	last	night...”	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">realisation	of	what	he	was	looking	at	dawned	on	him.	Links	were	beginning	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">form	 from	 the	 conversation	 he	 now	 remembered.	 Refugees,	 secret	 projects, </p>
<p class="calibre1">genocide...	“Didn't	he	say	that	the	Empire	had	been	completely	wiped	out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	two	talking	about?”	Kelly	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Last	night,	whilst	we	were	playing	poker,	this	guy	said	that	the	Empire	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	destroyed,	that	the	civil	war	actually	ended	years	ago,	and	that	all	that	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">left	were	a	load	of	refugees.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But...	we	just	went	up	against	Imperial	forces	when	we	attempted	to	take</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>,”	Kelly	said,	appearing	a	little	concerned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	shook	his	head.	“Those	weren't	them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle's	 irate	 demeanour	 appeared	 to	 have	 all	 but	 abandoned	 her	 for	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">time	being.	She	then	scowled.	“Wait,	what	are	you	talking	about?	Kelly's	right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pay	no	attention	to	him.	The	Empire	hasn't	been	 <i class="calibre4">wiped	out</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Estelle,	 you	 were	  <i class="calibre4">there</i>!	 What	 happened	 in	 that	 battle	 wasn't...	 well,	 it wasn't	normal.	I	don't	know	who	they	were,	but	those	were	 <i class="calibre4">not</i>	Imperial	pilots	in those	fighters.	None	of	us	would	have	survived	that	battle	if	we'd	not	been	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">ATAFs.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	folded	her	arms,	but	did	not	argue	with	him	further. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p231"></a>Dodds	 couldn't	 shake	 the	 feeling	 that	 he	 had	 his	 head	 in	 the	 lion's	 mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	again	at	the	groups	of	people	on	the	ground,	some	meeting	his	eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	 turning	 away,	 even	 those	 who	 looked	 as	 though	 they	 could	 handle</p>
<p class="calibre1">themselves.	“We'd	better	get	on	with	this	and	get	out	of	here,”	he	concluded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How?”	 Enrique	 said.	 “How	 are	 we	 going	 to	 be	 able	 to	 locate	 Barber</p>
<p class="calibre1">amongst	 all	 these	 people.	 She	 doesn't	 know	 we're	 coming,	 and	 like	 Parks	 said she's	hardly	likely	to	be	jumping	up	and	down,	waving	to	us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds'	 eyes	 swept	 over	 the	 groups	 and	 huddles,	 then	 turned	 back	 to	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">team	mates,	seeing	none	of	them	looking	very	optimistic.	Even	Chaz,	who	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	the	first	to	step	forward,	seemed	taken	aback	and	a	little	out	of	his	depth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	 must	 have	 been	 hundreds	 of	 people	 in	 the	 main	 hall	 alone	 and,	 to	 make matters	worse,	a	few	sets	of	stairs	at	one	end	led	up	to	another	floor	above.	How</p>
<p class="calibre1">many	more	floors	were	there?	How	many	pockets	would	they	have	to	search? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 know	 what?	 How	 about	 we	 just	 ask	 someone	 if	 they've	 seen	 her,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	suggested.	He	broke	from	his	team	mates,	making	his	way	over	to	a	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	had	singled	out	at	random. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dodds...”	Estelle	started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Estelle,	it's	cool,	I've	got	it,”	Dodds	said.	“I'm	just	going	to	ask	if	they've</p>
<p class="calibre1">seen	her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Be	careful,”	Estelle	called	after	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	looked	back	over	his	shoulder	with	what	he	hoped	was	a	confident</p>
<p class="calibre1">smile.	The	man	he	walked	towards	was	sat	crossed-legged	on	the	floor,	hunched</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	 a	 bowl	 of	 noodles,	 two	 chopsticks	 clasped	 in	 his	 hand.	 He	 glanced	 up	 as Dodds	approached	him,	a	look	of	fear	spreading	across	his	features.	He	shuffled</p>
<p class="calibre1">backward	 as	 Dodds	 drew	 closer	 and	 began	 shaking	 his	 head	 before	 turning	 his full	attention	back	to	his	food,	not	wishing	to	make	eye	contact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hi,	how	you	doing?”	Dodds	began.	“I'm	looking	for	a	woman...	er...	girl? </p>
<p class="calibre1">You	 know...	 not	 a	 man?”	 He	 gestured	 towards	 men	 and	 women	 as	 he	 spoke, </p>
<p class="calibre1">hoping	to	make	it	clear	which	gender	he	was	after. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“&lt;Don't	talk	to	 me!	There's	already	 been	enough	trouble	 today!	Just	leave</p>
<p class="calibre1">me	alone!&gt;”	the	man	spluttered	back	at	him.	His	hands	started	to	shake	and	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">tried	to	continue	eating,	unable	to	manipulate	the	sticks	enough	to	grasp	the	food</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	bowl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 looked	 around	 at	 Estelle	 who	 shrugged	 with	 puzzlement,	 not</p>
<p class="calibre1">understanding,	 either.	 He	 tried	 again,	 “She's	 a	 bit	 shorter	 than	 me,	 long	 black hair...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“&lt;Go	away!	Leave	me	alone!&gt;”	the	man	spluttered	again,	before	casting	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">bowl	 in	 Dodds'	 direction.	 He	 struggled	 to	 his	 feet,	 pushing	 aside	 those	 behind him	in	a	bid	to	escape,	his	bowl	of	noodles	clattering	to	the	ground,	spilling	its</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p232"></a>warm	 contents	 across	 the	 white	 marble	 tiled	 floor.	 The	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	 watched	 as	 he left,	 other	 refugees	 nearby	 moving	 closer	 to	 one	 another	 and	 a	 bit	 further	 back from	the	five	pilots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	isn't	going	to	be	easy,”	Enrique	said.	Estelle	was	in	agreement.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 going	 to	 have	 to	 apply	 a	 little	 more	 effort	 if	 they	 hoped	 to	 locate	 their contact	amongst	all	these	people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We'll	 just	 have	 to	 search	 for	 someone	 who	 is	 a	 little	 more	 cooperative,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	 said.	 “Split	 up	 and	 see	 if	 you	 can	 find	 someone	 who	 is	 more	 willing	 to talk.	We'll	try	this	central	area	first	and	then	move	on	into	the	other	parts	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">port.	If	any	of	you	get	into	any	sort	of	trouble,	shout	and	we'll	come	get	you.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">moment	you	find	out	 <i class="calibre4">anything</i>,	I	want	to	know.	Don't	do	anything	without	me, </p>
<p class="calibre1">that's	an	order.	Let's	go,	people.	The	sooner	we	find	the	agent,	the	sooner	we	can</p>
<p class="calibre1">leave	and	get	back	to	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">O</b>n	 the	 bridge	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>,	 helmsman	 Alan	 Cox	 stood	 waiting	 patiently	 as	 an engineer	took	a	look	at	his	console.	It	was	not	behaving	as	it	should:	the	touch-sensitive	surface	seeming	to	be	off	by	a	few	inches.	Every	time	he	tapped	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">screen,	there	was	a	chance	that	a	different	control	to	the	one	he	wanted	might	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">activated.	He	had	started	to	become	concerned	when	some	of	the	more	delicate</p>
<p class="calibre1">operations	 he	 needed	 to	 perform	 while	 the	 carrier	 continued	 to	 search	 for	 the missing	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	 became	 more	 difficult	 to	 execute.	 For	 a	 time,	 he	 had	 traded places	 with	 the	 controller	 across	 from	 him,	 so	 that	 he	 could	 continue	 his	 duty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	now	that	the	carrier	was	holding	position,	pausing	in	its	search,	he	had	taken</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	opportunity	to	have	the	problem	dealt	with. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks	like	one	of	the	calibration	relay	nodes	has	given	out,”	the	engineer</p>
<p class="calibre1">said	from	beneath	the	console,	pulling	out	a	small	circuit	board. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	have	a	spare?”	Cox	asked,	toying	with	a	screwdriver	the	engineer</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	used	to	remove	the	bottom	panel	of	the	console. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Plenty.	I	can	go	and	get	one	and	be	back	up	soon.	Shouldn't	take	more	than</p>
<p class="calibre1">ten	or	fifteen	minutes.	Do	you	need	it	urgently?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So-so,”	the	navigator	replied.	“The	captain	has	ordered	us	to	hold	position</p>
<p class="calibre1">here.	 According	 to	 him,  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	 should	 be	 somewhere	 close	 by.	 But	 so	 far	 we haven't	detected	anything,	not	even	on	the	long-range	scanners.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	way	Hawke	had	been	acting	had	set	Cox	on	edge.	He	had	voiced	these</p>
<p class="calibre1">concerns	with	some	of	the	other	crew	once	his	captain	had	departed	the	bridge, </p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 his	 way	 to	 his	 private	 office	 to	 receive	 a	 communication	 that	 had	 come	 in from	CSN	HQ.	Though	they	did	not	talk	for	long,	it	became	evident	that	the	rest</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	crew	shared	his	feelings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon	 his	 return,	 Hawke	 had	 ordered	 that	 they	 jump	 to	 an	 adjoining	 star</p>
<p class="calibre1">system,	 in	 which	 they	 would	 at	 last	 find	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>.	 But	 within	 minutes	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i> arriving	at	its	destination,	the	commodore	had	once	again	departed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following	 the	 allied	 forces'	 failed	 attempt	 to	 retake	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon, </i>	 and	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p234"></a>unusual	disappearance	of	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,	Hawke	had	ordered	Meyers	to	return	to	Spirit alone.	 He	 had	 then	 taken	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	 and	 begun	 a	 systematic	 sweep	 of	 the	 nearest adjacent	 star	 systems	 to	 Aster,	 in	 case	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	 had	 become	 stranded	 in	 one	 of those.	 But	 though	 they	 had	 hunted	 for	 many	 hours,	 their	 search	 had	 turned	 up nothing,	the	likelihood	of	finding	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	close	by	diminishing	with	each	system they	came	to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 as	 they	 scanned	 their	 fifth	 system	 that	 Hawke	 had	 received	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">message	 from	 naval	 headquarters.	 It	 had	 informed	 him	 that	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	 had	 been located	 and,	 as	 luck	 would	 have	 it,	 was	 drifting	 in	 a	 star	 system	 alongside	 the one	they	were	currently	scanning.	Hawke	had	ordered	that	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	 make	 that	 their destination.	 But	 upon	 arriving,	 the	 crew	 had	 been	 greeted	 by	 nothing	 except</p>
<p class="calibre1">another	empty	system,	the	only	highlight	of	the	region	being	the	twisted	hues	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 nebulas	 that	 were	 so	 prominent	 in	 that	 part	 of	 the	 galaxy.	 Hawke	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">returned	to	his	private	office	to	watch	the	message	again,	so	as	to,	as	he	had	put</p>
<p class="calibre1">it,	“ensure	that	he	had	not	made	a	mistake”. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	 his	 lack	 of	 commitment	 to	 the	 previous	 battle,	 the	 crew	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">beginning	 to	 question	 his	 command.	 Cox	 was	 not	 about	 to	 challenge	 the	 man's authority,	however;	the	thought	of	a	stay	in	the	brig	and	a	court-martial	were	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">high	on	his	list	of	priorities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	 you	 sure	 we're	 in	 the	 right	 place?”	 the	 engineer	 wanted	 to	 know, </p>
<p class="calibre1">emerging	from	beneath	and	console	and	looking	out	the	thick	glass	windows	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>'s	main	viewport,	to	the	empty	space	beyond.	“You	could	have	punched	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrong	destination	into	the	console?	Wouldn't	be	surprising	the	way	this	thing	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">so	out	of	whack.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 was	 using	 that	 one,”	 said	 Cox,	 indicating	 the	 console	 across	 from	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	I	should	check	that	one,	too?”	the	engineer	suggested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	that	moment,	Cox	heard	the	bridge	lift	doors	open	and	looking	around	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw	Hawke	come	striding	down	the	long	aisle,	people	on	either	side	turning	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">anticipation	of	what	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>'s	captain	would	say	about	the	situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,”	Cox	requested	his	captain's	attention.	“We've	performed	a	full	sweep</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 system	 and	 we've	 not	 been	 able	 to	 detect	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>.	 Either	 it's	 not	 here	 or we're	in	the	wrong	place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 Lieutenant,	 we're	 exactly	 where	 we	 need	 to	 be,”	 Hawke	 answered</p>
<p class="calibre1">him,	eyes	focused	on	the	space	ahead	of	him,	not	shifting	his	head	the	slightest</p>
<p class="calibre1">bit	to	acknowledge	the	man	who	had	spoken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir...”	Cox	tried	to	engage	Hawke	once	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Wait</i>,	Lieutenant,”	was	all	that	Hawke	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cox	turned	and	looked	at	the	engineer,	who	gave	a	slight	shrug.	It	appeared</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p235"></a>to	 him	 that	 Hawke	 was	 watching	 for	 something.	 Cox	 heard	 confused	 whispers being	 exchanged	 across	 the	 length	 of	 the	 bridge,	 many	 seeking	 an	 explanation for	 Hawke's	 statement.	 The	 answer	 came	 in	 the	 form	 of	 a	 number	 of	 consoles, that	all	started	to	wail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain,	 jump	 points	 forming!”	 a	 woman's	 voice	 called	 out.	 “We've	 got</p>
<p class="calibre1">incoming	on	the	port,	stern...	All	sides,	sir!”	She,	as	did	many	others,	looked	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawke	for	the	course	of	action	to	take.	But	despite	what	he	had	just	been	told, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 man	 did	 not	 so	 much	 as	 even	 flinch.	 Hawke	 stood	 still,	 watching	 ahead	 of him	 as	 a	 large	 jump	 point	 swirled	 into	 existence.	 From	 out	 of	 it	 slipped	 the dagger-like	form	of	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>,	the	enormous	Confederation	battleship	slowing	as	it drew	itself	up	to	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During	the	previous	battle	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	had	held	back	from	the	action,	granting	Cox</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	the	merest	of	suggestions	as	to	the	tremendous	size	of	the	battleship.	Now, </p>
<p class="calibre1">with	the	hulking	mass	of	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	bearing	down	upon	them,	Cox	found	himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">wishing	he	could	once	again	be	much	further	away;	the	other	side	of	the	galaxy</p>
<p class="calibre1">preferably. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain,	 radars	 indicate	 a	 number	 of	 Imperial	 frigates	 have	 exited	 jump</p>
<p class="calibre1">points	and	are	on	approach	vectors,”	the	same	woman	reported. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawke	said	nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain,	I	suggest	we	put	full	power	to	shields,	arm	weaponry	and	prepare</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	withdraw	from	the	system,”	Lucas	Short,	Hawke's	second	in	command,	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stand	 down!”	 Hawke	 spun	 around,	 addressing	 the	 crew	 for	 the	 first	 time</p>
<p class="calibre1">since	returning	to	the	bridge.	Cox,	stood	the	closest	to	the	man,	subconsciously</p>
<p class="calibre1">backed	 up.	 Hawke's	 eyes	 were	 alight,	 almost	 daring	 anyone	 to	 challenge	 him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We're	 completely	 surrounded!	 We	 make	 any	 sign	 of	 aggression	 and	 they	 will</p>
<p class="calibre1">blow	this	ship	to	pieces!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	a	moment,	Cox	did	not	know	what	they	should	be	more	afraid	of:	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrival	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	 and	 a	 host	 of	 Imperial	 warships,	 or	 Commodore	 Hawke.	 He turned	 worried	 eyes	 in	 the	 direction	 of	 the	 engineer,	 who	 had	 backed	 off	 a	 lot more,	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	 is	 requesting	 communications,”	 the	 operative	 of	 the	 console adjacent	to	Cox's	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Grant	it,”	Hawke	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 holographic	 screen	 sprung	 up	 at	 the	 front	 of	 the	 bridge	 moments	 later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 screen	 showed	 a	 man	 whom	 none	 of	 the	 crew	 failed	 to	 recognise,	 having</p>
<p class="calibre1">seen	his	face	not	hours	earlier	that	morning,	during	the	mission	briefing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	is	Fleet	Admiral	Zackaria	of	the	Imperial	Senate	battleship,  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">began	 the	 highly-decorated	 man	 on	 the	 holographic	 projection.	 “You	 will</p>
<p class="calibre1">surrender	immediately.	Drop	your	shields	and	prepare	to	be	boarded.”	Zackaria's</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p236"></a>face	was	impassive	throughout	his	brief	speech. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As	you	wish,	Admiral,”	Hawke	said.	Zackaria's	statement	was	short,	but	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	point,	and	Hawke	made	no	attempt	whatsoever	to	argue	against	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cox	 felt	 his	 blood	 freeze	 as	 Hawke	 turned	 to	 look	 straight	 at	 him.	 There</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	something	about	the	look	in	his	eyes;	as	if	all	humanity	had	been	stripped</p>
<p class="calibre1">clean.	Cox	fought	an	urge	to	flee	and	escape	the	unwanted	attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Relay	 the	 order	 that	 we	 are	 to	 receive	 boarders.	 All	 crew	 are	 to	 stand</p>
<p class="calibre1">down.	We	are	to	give	Admiral	Zackaria	full,	unchallenged	access	to	the	ship.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	my	console...”	Cox	somehow	managed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawke's	eyes	lowered,	seeing	the	panel	beneath	lying	open	on	the	floor.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	to	a	man	sat	at	the	console	across	from	Cox's. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mr	Parsons...”	Hawke	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain,	 might	 I	 suggest	 that	 we	 take	 immediate	 actions	 to...”	 Short</p>
<p class="calibre1">interrupted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	are	 <i class="calibre4">surrounded</i>,	Mr	Short,”	Hawke	flared.	He	looked	again	to	the	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	had	addressed	as	Parsons.	“Relay	the	order	to	stand	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parsons	 hesitated	 for	 a	 moment	 and	 then	 did	 as	 he	 was	 ordered,	 his	 voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">issuing	from	speakers	and	echoing	down	the	numerous	corridors	of	the	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cox	 began	 to	 wonder	 if	 this	 was	 some	 sort	 of	 ruse,	 designed	 to	 lure	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Imperial	 admiral	 over	 to	 the	 carrier,	 where	 he	 could	 be	 dealt	 with.	 If	 it	 was,	 it was	a	particularly	dangerous	one,	with	no	apparent	room	for	error. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lower	shields,”	Hawke	ordered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bow	quadrant?”	came	the	reluctant	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">All</i>	shields,”	Hawke	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	image	of	Zackaria	remained	patient	and	still	in	the	hologram,	waiting</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	 the	 acknowledgement	 that	 the	 Confederation	 carrier	 had	 complied	 with	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">request. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shields	 lowered,”	 Cox	 heard,	 his	 heartbeat	 starting	 to	 increase.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">fingered	the	screwdriver	he	still	held,	his	grip	tightening	on	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You're	free	to	come	aboard,	Admiral,”	Hawke	prompted	to	Zackaria,	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">terminated	the	communication	without	another	word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moments	later,	from	out	the	frontal	viewport,	Cox	saw	transport	craft	begin</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 depart	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>,	 swinging	 themselves	 around	 from	 the	 launch	 bays	 running along	 the	 side	 of	 the	 battleship,	 and	 heading	 towards	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>.	 At	 first,	 it	 appeared that	only	three	shuttles	were	making	their	way	over.	It	then	became	apparent	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	enemy	forces	intended	to	fill	every	last	inch	of	the	carrier	with	their	ranks; </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	three	becoming	five,	then	seven,	then	ten,	as	the	numbers	built	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Out	 of	 the	 corners	 of	 the	 bridge's	 thick	 glass	 window,	 Cox	 spied	 two</p>
<p class="calibre1">Imperial	 frigates,	 hovering	 closed	 by.	 He	 looked	 to	 a	 display	 further	 up	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p237"></a>bridge:	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>'s	 radar	 told	 the	 whole	 story,	 indicating	 that	 the	 carrier	 was surrounded	by	a	total	of	six	frigates;	three	on	each	side.	Not	that	their	presence</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 required.  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	 needed	 no	 assistance.	 He	 swallowed	 and	 felt	 a	 chill	 run down	his	spine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawke	 turned	 his	 back	 on	 the	 crew,	 to	 instead	 follow	 the	 progress	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">transports	that	were	streaming	from	the	former	Confederation	flagship.	As	he	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">so,	Cox	glanced	down	the	aisle	of	the	bridge.	He	noticed	that	Short	had	begun	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">whisper	with	two	others	sitting	close	to	him,	peeking	at	the	commodore	who	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">staring	out	at	the	enormous	battleship,	that	rested	so	close	to	them.	He	assumed</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	had	come	to	the	same	conclusion	as	he:	this	was	no	ruse.	Whatever	the	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 planning,	 it	 did	 not	 appear	 to	 involve	 the	 capture	 of	 Zackaria.	 Whether	 he intended	to	bargain	with	him,	whether	it	be	with	the	crew	or	the	carrier,	matters</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	not	be	allowed	to	progress	any	further.	He	watched	as	they	conferred	for</p>
<p class="calibre1">sometime	before	they	all	nodded	in	agreement	and	prepared	to	make	their	move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Short	rose	from	his	seat.	“Commodore	Hawke,	it	is	my	belief	that	you	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	 longer	 functioning	 with	 the	 best	 interests	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>,	 her	 crew	 or	 the Confederation	 at	 heart.”	 He	 started	 towards	 the	 front.	 “It	 is	 also	 my	 belief	 that your	judgement	have	been	adversely	affected	by	recent	events	and	that	you	are</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	longer	capable	of	making	rational	decisions.	As	second-in-command	of	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>,	I am	exercising	my	authority	to	hereby	relieve	you	of	your	post.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawke	 turned	 from	 his	 admiration	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>,	 wearing	 a	 tired	 expression, as	though	his	crew	had	now	become	a	bother	unto	him.	The	two	others	that	Short</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 been	 speaking	 with	 stood	 up	 with	 him,	 flanking	 his	 sides	 as	 they	 strode towards	the	carrier's	captain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawke's	 face	 darkened,	 his	 expression	 became	 quite	 grim,	 and	 in	 a	 cold</p>
<p class="calibre1">voice	he	said,	“Return	to	your	seat,	Commander.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Short	 continued	 as	 though	 not	 hearing	 the	 words.	 “Lieutenant	 Lee, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lieutenant	 Dawes,	 please	 escort	 Commodore	 Hawke	 from	 the	 bridge	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">confine	 him	 to	 quarters,”	 he	 said	 to	 the	 man	 and	 woman	 who	 walked	 by	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">sides. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawke	 said	 nothing	 more.	 With	 lightning	 reflexes,	 he	 reached	 into	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">jacket	 and	 produced	 a	 laser	 pistol.	 He	 trained	 the	 weapon	 on	 both	 Lee	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dawes	 and,	 before	 either	 of	 them	 could	 react,	 shot	 them	 both	 neatly	 in	 the foreheads.	Their	limp	bodies	slumped	to	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cox	jumped	back.	The	need	to	escape	the	bridge	was	now	very	urgent.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">saw	that	the	rest	of	the	bridge	crew	appeared	to	share	his	thoughts,	many	having</p>
<p class="calibre1">left	their	seats	and	now	standing.	Cox	was	unable	to	comprehend	what	had	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened:	 the	 speed	 at	 which	 Hawke	 had	 not	 only	 produced	 the	 weapon,	 but</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	 dispatched	 Lee	 and	 Dawes,	 had	 left	 him	 in	 a	 state	 of	 total	 shock	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p238"></a>confusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Lee	and	Dawes	dropped	down	beside	him,	Lieutenant	Short's	eyes	grew</p>
<p class="calibre1">wide	with	fear	and	he	started	to	back	away	from	Hawke,	looking	behind	him	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">two	men	stood	by	the	bridge's	lift	doors.	Hawke	then	trained	the	pistol	on	Short</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Security...”	 Short	 started,	 before	 Hawke	 pulled	 the	 trigger	 and	 he,	 too, </p>
<p class="calibre1">collapsed	in	a	heap	on	the	ground,	blood	from	all	three	of	the	dead	beginning	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">seep	from	the	wounds	in	their	heads. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawke's	eyes	darted	over	the	others	occupying	the	bridge,	marking	out	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	men	and	women	who,	though	standing,	remained	rooted	in	shock.	Movement</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 the	 other	 end	 of	 the	 aisle	 grabbed	 his	 attention	 and	 he	 focused	 the	 pistol	 to meet	 the	 new	 threat.	 “Drop	 them!”	 he	 called	 to	 the	 two	 security	 guards	 who stood	at	the	far	end	of	the	long	bridge,	next	to	the	lift,	who	had	just	broken	into	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">run	towards	him.	“Drop	them	now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 two	 men	 obeyed	 without	 question,	 throwing	 their	 guns	 aside	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">raising	their	hands	in	surrender.	Even	though	they	were	a	great	deal	further	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	Short	had	been,	the	two	security	personnel	were	clearly	not	prepared	to	test</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	how	fast	or	accurate	Hawke	could	be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everyone,	down	on	your	knees,	hands	on	heads,”	Hawke	spat	to	his	entire</p>
<p class="calibre1">bridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No-one	moved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“KNEES!	NOW!”	Hawke	shouted,	waving	the	laser	pistol	about.	It	passed</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 Cox's	 direction	 and	 the	 man	 found	 himself	 dropping	 to	 the	 floor	 as	 his	 legs gave	way,	his	hands	flying	to	the	top	of	his	head.	The	tone	in	Hawke's	voice	told</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	that	the	man	was	in	no	mood	to	be	trifled	with.	In	the	floor's	dim	reflection, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cox	saw	the	engineer	lower	down	next	to	him.	A	few	moments	later,	he	gingerly</p>
<p class="calibre1">raised	his	eyes	from	the	floor	to	look	at	Hawke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind	him,	the	transports	continued	to	stream	from	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>,	making	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">way	towards	the	main	launch	bay	of	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>.	Hawke	continued	to	mark	the	crew	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	got	down	on	the	floor,	watching	each	and	every	one	of	them	for	the	slightest</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempt	at	escape	or	attack.	In	the	face	of	what	had	just	happened,	however,	none</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 them	 were	 about	 to	 dare,	 some	 preferring	 to	 stare	 down	 at	 the	 floor	 than	 at Hawke's	rage-twisted	expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 not	 long	 before	 the	 first	 wing	 of	 transports	 started	 to	 enter	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>'s launch	bay,	setting	themselves	down	inside.	Even	as	they	did	so,	more	could	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">seen	departing	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>,	 forming	 a	 huge	 caravan	 reminiscent	 of	 those	 departing Spirit	 earlier	 that	 day.	 The	 image	 of	 the	 transports	 streaming	 towards	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Confederation	 carrier,	 no	 doubt	 carrying	 with	 them	 scores	 of	 Imperial	 soldiers, deadly	 weaponry	 and	 God	 only	 knew	 whatever	 else,	 did	 nothing	 but	 fill	 all	 its</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p239"></a>witnesses	with	a	sense	of	dread	and	terrible	unease. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	would	happen	when	they	arrived?	Why	was	this	happening?	What	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawke	plan	to	do?	The	questions	raced	through	Cox's	mind.	Though,	for	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">reason	he	felt	fear	starting	to	pass,	being	edged	out	by	a	new	feeling:	anger.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	 down	 the	 bridge,	 along	 the	 rows	 of	 crew	 that	 were	 on	 their	 knees.	 He noted	one	young	man	who	he	could	see	was	trembling.	The	man	made	a	quick</p>
<p class="calibre1">snap	look	at	the	lift.	Cox	wished	he	could	tell	the	man	to	stay	where	he	was,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	had	already	made	up	his	mind.	Cox	saw	him	leap	to	his	feet	and	start	towards</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	lift,	arm	outstretched,	reaching	for	the	call	button. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	managed	but	a	few	feet	before	Hawke	felled	him,	the	thin	red	beam	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 laser	 cutting	 its	 way	 through	 the	 back	 of	 his	 head.	 The	 young	 man	 crashed forward	across	the	floor,	legs	giving	way	beneath	him,	his	arms	splayed	out	as	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">went	down.	Like	the	others	that	had	fallen	to	the	shots,	he	gave	no	cry	as	he	fell, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 those	 who	 continued	 to	 comply	 with	 Hawke's	 command	 flinched	 at	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">sound	 of	 his	 body	 slamming	 down.	 Still	 they	 kept	 their	 hands	 on	 their	 heads, facing	the	floor,	looking	down	at	the	dim	reflections	of	their	own	worried	faces</p>
<p class="calibre1">staring	back	at	them. </p>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	 occupants	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>'s	 flight	 deck	 stood	 by	 powerless	 as	 the	 first	 of	 the transports	 opened	 up,	 the	 passengers	 like	 none	 they	 had	 ever	 seen	 before:	 they were	clad	almost	entirely	in	black,	save	for	a	strange	white	emblem	on	their	left</p>
<p class="calibre1">breast	 and	 right	 arm,	 and	 a	 pair	 of	 scowling	 ruby-red	 eyes,	 affixed	 into	 their helmets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 soldiers	 spilled	 out	 of	 the	 craft,	 rifles	 raised	 to	 secure	 the	 area.	 They spoke	no	words,	but	gestured	to	the	deck's	occupants	that	they	should,	like	those</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	bridge,	place	their	hands	on	their	heads	and	get	down	on	their	knees.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">various	maintenance	workers,	pilots	and	other	service	personnel	did	as	they	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">ordered,	terrified	by	the	sight	before	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	did	not	take	long	for	the	soldiers	to	secure	the	area,	and	before	long	they</p>

<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p240"></a>“Sir,	 the	 admiral...”	 Cox	 heard	 a	 woman's	 voice	 come	 over	 the	 carrier's	 PA system. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Escort	him	up	to	the	bridge,”	Hawke	said	without	waiting	for	her	to	finish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	time,	the	bridge's	lift	doors	opened	and	Cox	turned	to	see	who	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">entering	 the	 bridge.	 Four	 figures	 stood	 within	 the	 elevator	 car	 as	 the	 doors parted,	 one	 of	 them	 a	 member	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>'s	 security	 team.	 The	 woman	 was	 being held	under	the	arms	by	two	tall	soldiers,	who	stepped	out	of	the	lift	and	tossed</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	body	down	on	the	floor,	bringing	the	bridge's	body	count	up	to	five.	She	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	shot	in	the	back	of	the	head,	her	blonde	hair	wet,	sticky	and	matted	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">blood	that	had	poured	from	the	wound.	He	guessed	she	had	attempted	to	get	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	man	whom	the	two	soldiers	were	escorting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now	on	the	bridge,	the	two	soldiers	stood	to	attention	either	side	of	the	lift</p>
<p class="calibre1">doors,	presenting	their	rifles	and	making	way	for	the	last	person	to	depart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zackaria	 strode	 down	 the	 long	 aisle	 towards	 Hawke,	 the	 commodore</p>
<p class="calibre1">returning	 the	 laser	 pistol	 to	 the	 inside	 of	 his	 jacket.	 He	 was	 clothed	 in	 formal Imperial	naval	dress,	the	condition	of	his	uniform	verging	on	perfection:	crease</p>
<p class="calibre1">free	 and	 decorated	 to	 great	 spender.	 A	 long,	 blood	 red	 cloak	 rippled	 gently behind	 him	 as	 he	 walked,	 falling	 about	 a	 foot	 clear	 of	 the	 floor	 and	 fastened about	 the	 shoulders	 by	 a	 gold	 chain	 that	 ran	 just	 under	 his	 neck.	 Though</p>
<p class="calibre1">surrounded	by	his	enemies,	he	walked	with	calm	down	the	bridge's	central	aisle, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 soles	 of	 his	 dark	 gleaming	 shoes	 clopping	 on	 the	 floor	 as	 he	 went.	 They seemed	 to	 perfectly	 punctuate	 his	 entrance,	 being	 now	 the	 only	 sound	 besides the	tense	breathing	of	the	crew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawke	 remained	 where	 he	 was,	 waiting	 for	 the	 admiral	 to	 approach, </p>
<p class="calibre1">whereupon	he	saluted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cox	 was	 shocked;	 even	 more	 so	 when	 the	 two	 men	 began	 to	 speak.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">language	 was	 strange	 and	 he	 could	 not	 understand	 a	 single	 word,	 yet	 Hawke's command	of	the	dialect	appeared	perfect.	It	rolled	off	his	tongue	effortlessly,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">sounded	 nothing	 like	 the	 Imperial	 dialects	 he	 was	 expecting,	 even	 with	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">admiral's	 accent.	 And	 there	 was	 something	 else	 there,	 something	 that	 did	 not quite	sound	like	normal	human	speech. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>

<p class="calibre1">The	discussion	over,	Hawke	readdressed	the	bridge	crew.	“I	have	negotiated	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">surrender	of	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>.	From	here	on	out,	I	alone	will	fall	under	the	command	of	Fleet Admiral	 Zackaria.	 The	 Empire	 no	 longer	 has	 need	 for	 any	 of	 you;	 you	 are	 all now	redundant.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Heads	looked	up	in	shock,	eyes	darting	from	the	two	men	that	stood	at	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">front	of	the	bridge,	to	the	two	black-clad	soldiers	that	marked	the	lift	doors.	Cox</p>
<p class="calibre1">met	 many	 eyes	 as	 he	 looked	 to	 those	 knelt	 on	 the	 floor,	 and	 they	 all	 said	 the same	 thing:	 their	 worst	 fear	 was	 upon	 them,	 they	 were	 going	 die.	 Even	 if	 they could	escape	the	bridge	and	make	it	down	to	the	flight	deck,	there	was	no	telling</p>
<p class="calibre1">just	how	many	soldiers	would	be	waiting	for	them	down	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	for	Cox,	that	was	the	last	straw.	He	had	to	do	something	about	this.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">might	not	be	able	to	save	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	or	guarantee	that	the	crew	could	get	away	from	the enemy	forces	that	surrounded	them,	but	he	would	make	certain	that	Hawke	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	celebrate	his	victory	here	today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grasping	the	screwdriver	that	he	had	secreted	in	his	hands	when	Hawke	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">ordered	 them	 all	 down	 on	 the	 ground,	 he	 ensured	 the	 shaft	 was	 fully	 exposed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	like	Hawke's	neck.	He	started	to	build	himself	up;	preparing	to	drive	the	tool</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	 the	 man's	 throat;	 to	 rip	 it	 apart	 so	 that	 the	 man	 suffocated	 or	 drowned	 in blood	or	whatever	would	happen	when	he	drove	the	implement	home.	And	after</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	few	moments	of	mental	preparation,	he	was	ready. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	made	no	sound	as	he	moved.	No	heroic	cry	or	final	comment	as	he	went</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 the	 commodore.	 He	 moved	 fluidly,	 as	 only	 one	 might	 under	 such</p>
<p class="calibre1">circumstances,	in	one	final	attempt	to	bring	about	justice.	He	did	not	falter	nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">stumble,	his	leap	from	his	knelt	position	towards	Hawke	verging	on	perfection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	next	few	seconds	became	a	blur	of	pain	and	confusion.	It	started	with	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">solid	grasp	of	the	arm	in	which	he	held	the	small	weapon.	It	was	followed	by	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">loud	 snapping	 noise,	 a	 spinning	 of	 his	 world,	 and	 ending	 in	 a	 tremendous</p>
<p class="calibre1">amount	of	pain,	the	screwdriver	flying	from	his	hand,	its	task	unfulfilled.	He	felt</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p242"></a>For	a	time,	his	world	was	black.	The	dizziness	then	cleared	and	he	came	to, feeling	 total	 agony.	 He	 lifted	 his	 head	 as	 best	 he	 could,	 trying	 to	 will	 the	 stars away	 that	 were	 filling	 his	 vision.	 He	 couldn't	 move	 his	 legs;	 they	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">unresponsive	and	useless.	Even	lifting	his	head	felt	like	a	monumental	task.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">fought	to	piece	together	what	had	happened	to	him... </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	had	leapt	up,	the	handle	of	the	tool	held	tight	in	his	hand,	his	heroic</p>
<p class="calibre1">intents	had	been	thwarted	by	Zackaria.	Without	a	word,	the	admiral	had	caught</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	outstretched	arm	about	the	wrist	as	he	drew	back	in	preparation	to	plunge	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">implement	into	Hawke's	neck.	With	one	quick	and	powerful	twist,	he	had	broken</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	helmsman's	arm	and	the	screwdriver	had	tumbled	from	Cox's	grasp.	Zackaria</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 then	 spun	 the	 man	 around	 and	  <i class="calibre4">thrown	 him</i>	 in	 the	 direction	 he	 had	 been heading. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 remembered	 feeling	 the	 sensation	 of	 travelling	 through	 the	 air,	 but	 it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	something	he	struggled	with;	for	he	had	not	travelled	just	a	few	feet	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">throw,	 but	 the	 remaining	 width	 of	 the	 bridge	 itself.	 He	 had	 flown	 a	 distance	 of well	over	ten	meters,	his	feet	leaving	the	floor	by	several	meters	themselves.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">height	 baffled	 him.	 He	 may	 have	 travelled	 much	 further,	 if	 the	 wall	 on	 the opposite	side	of	the	bridge	had	not	halted	his	advance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	couldn't	believe	what	had	just	happened:	 <i class="calibre4">the	man	was	over	sixty	years</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">old! </i>	 And	 yet	 he	 had,	 with	 precious	 little	 effort,	 disarmed	 and	 then	 thrown	 him across	the	bridge,	as	if	he	were	nothing	more	than	a	small	animal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cox	 could	 not	 stand,	 nor	 move	 his	 legs,	 no	 matter	 how	 hard	 he	 tried.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">became	aware	of	a	pair	of	black	shoes	in	front	of	him,	and	turned	two	pleading</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes	up	to	face	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>'s	captain,	imploring	him	to	find	mercy. </p>

<p class="calibre1">brave	 and	 one	 of	 the	 few	 people	 who	 may	 offer	 a	 helpful	 response.	 Before	 all that,	 however,	 there	 was	 one	 small	 hurdle	 that	 needed	 to	 be	 overcome.	 Chaz</p>
<p class="calibre1">stole	a	glance	over	his	shoulder	to	see	if	his	team	mates	were	anywhere	close	by, </p>

<p class="calibre1">“&lt;Hello	 there.	 My	 name's	 Chaz.	 What's	 yours?&gt;”	 he	 asked	 with	 a	 warm</p>

<p class="calibre1">Chaz	smiled	to	himself.	It	amused	him	that	the	boy	was	assuming	that	was</p>

<p class="calibre1">Still	 wandering	 about,	 trying	 to	 find	 someone	 who	 might	 be	 able	 to	 help	 him, Dodds	saw	Chaz	striding	in	his	direction.	As	he	approached,	Dodds	noted	a	look</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	anger	on	his	face	and	took	a	step	backward.	It	was	the	same	expression	Chaz</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	worn	when	Parks	had	reassigned	the	five	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	to	the	Temper	system.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">man's	fists	were	balled,	his	eyes,	though	narrowed,	blazing.	If	the	security	guards</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	Xalan	Orbital	had	shown	reluctance	in	tackling	Chaz	back	then,	Dodds	knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	right	now	it	would	be	like	confronting	a	fifteen-hundred-pound	grizzly	bear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	happened?”	Dodds	asked	as	the	big	man	strode	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Barber's	dead,”	Chaz	growled,	not	bothering	to	stop	and	causing	Dodds	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">hurry	along	after	him.	“She's	been	taken	to	the	infirmary.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	should	let	the	others	know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	you	should,”	was	the	blunt	reply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 stopped	 walking	 at	 the	 comment.	 For	 the	 few	 months	 Dodds	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">known	him,	he	had	found	that	Chaz	was	generally	a	very	quiet	character.	Every</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	and	again	he	was	moody,	but	easy	to	get	along	with	when	you	got	on	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">back	 retreating	 past	 him,	 Dodds	 figured	 that	 at	 this	 very	 moment	 there	 was	 no right	side	of	Chaz	to	be	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under	 the	 circumstances,	 he	 decided	 it	 would	 be	 best	 to	 do	 as	 Chaz	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">suggested	 and	 soon	 rounded	 up	 the	 other	  <i class="calibre4">Knights, </i>	 who	 then,	 after	 consulting	 a floor	plan,	made	their	way	towards	the	port's	medical	unit. </p>

<p class="calibre1">“Sound	proof,”	Dodds	said	as	the	doors	to	the	infirmary	swung	closed	behind	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">four	men	and	women,	dampening	the	sounds	from	the	rest	of	the	port. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Probably	to	help	the	staff	and	the	patients	relax,”	Enrique	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You're	sure	he	came	in	here?”	Estelle	said.	She	had	almost	lost	her	mind</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p247"></a>when	Dodds	had	informed	her	that	Chaz	had	headed	off	to	the	infirmary	alone and	without	consulting	her.	Not	that	there	had	been	very	much	to	discuss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like	I	said,	he	seemed	rather	keen	to	get	here,”	Dodds	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See	 if	 you	 can	 lock	 the	 door,”	 Estelle	 ordered.	 Dodds	 did	 as	 he	 was	 told and	after	studying	a	panel	next	to	the	door	he	succeeded	in	securing	it.	The	little</p>
<p class="calibre1">clicking	 sound	 told	 him	 that	 it	 was	 not	 a	 very	 sturdy	 lock,	 more	 of	 a	 deterrent than	anything	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	 moved	 down	 various	 corridors	 in	 their	 search	 for	 Chaz	 and Barber,	 the	 whole	 place	 looking	 like	 a	 small	 hospital.	 They	 searched	 every</p>
<p class="calibre1">waiting	and	examination	room	they	came	to,	but	found	them	empty,	without	any</p>

<p class="calibre1">“You	 don't	 have	 to	 come	 in	 if	 you	 don't	 want	 to,”	 Dodds	 said,	 aware	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly	was	not	good	with	dead	bodies.	No	matter	how	many	she	saw,	she	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">never	get	used	to	them,	absurd	visions	and	fears	filling	her	head.	The	thought	of</p>

<p class="calibre1">“No,	 we	 stay	 together,”	 Estelle	 interjected,	 before	 she	 heaved	 the	 heavy</p>
<p class="calibre1">door	of	the	mortuary	open,	revealing	the	scene	within	to	all.	There,	standing	over</p>

<p class="calibre1">neither	moved	from	where	he	stood,	nor	made	any	other	sign	to	acknowledge	her</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p248"></a>Dodds	walked	forward	and	came	to	stand	next	to	Chaz,	Estelle	and	Enrique following	 behind	 him.	 He	 looked	 down	 at	 the	 woman	 lying	 on	 the	 gurney,	 her eyes	 still	 open,	 dried	 blood	 staining	 her	 mouth	 and	 chin,	 her	 face	 very	 pale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz's	eyes	were	filled	with	a	mixture	of	anger	and	sadness	as	he	continued	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">stare	down	at	the	woman,	his	fists	still	clenched	into	tight	balls	by	his	sides. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 looked	 around	 and	 saw	 that	 Kelly	 had	 taken	 few	 steps	 forward, </p>
<p class="calibre1">making	little	effort	to	cross	the	threshold	of	the	mortuary	doorway.	She	gave	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	look	of	deep	concern	as	her	eyes	shifted	from	Barber	to	Chaz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	a	few	moments,	one	of	Chaz's	hands	left	his	side.	Two	fingers	found</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	way	to	the	woman's	eyes	and	gently	closed	her	eyelids. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does	she	have	the	data	card?”	Estelle	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	 continued	 to	 say	 nothing,	 and	 instead	 ran	 his	 fingers	 across	 Barber's</p>
<p class="calibre1">cheek.	It	was	as	if	he	was	saying	goodbye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 saw	 Estelle	 mouth	 several	 curses,	 then,	 “We	 don't	 have	 time	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing	the	man	as	being	disinterested	in	Estelle's	questioning,	Dodds	once</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	took	the	initiative	and	reached	forward	to	investigate	Barber's	jacket.	Chaz</p>
<p class="calibre1">caught	him	tight	about	the	wrist	as	he	took	hold	of	the	zipper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'll	do	it,”	he	said	in	a	cold	voice,	without	taking	his	eyes	off	Barber's	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	looked	up	at	the	big	man,	knowing	that	he	would	not	be	able	to	free</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	wrist	from	such	a	solid	grasp.	He	released	his	grip	on	the	zipper.	Chaz	took	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">instead	 and	 undid	 the	 dead	 woman's	 jacket,	 exposing	 the	 white	 vest	 she	 wore underneath.	 It	 was	 soaked	 with	 blood	 and	 torn	 in	 places	 where	 it	 had	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">slashed.	Beneath	the	ripped	material,	crimson	spots	of	congealed	blood,	gathered</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	lacerated	white	flesh,	were	quite	visible.	They	looked	like	stab	wounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 was	 reminded	 of	 Dean's	 wounds,	 as	 the	 man	 had	 lain	 dying	 on	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">parents'	couch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	 started	 to	 search	 the	 inner	 pockets	 of	 the	 jacket	 as	 the	 others	 looked on.	After	he	failed	to	find	anything,	he	checked	the	outer	ones.	Then	those	of	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">trousers.	His	searching	started	to	become	more	urgent	as	he	turned	out	more	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	pockets	and	did	not	find	what	he	was	looking	for.	He	then	pulled	off	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">boots,	though	from	the	way	they	were	so	tightly	laced	it	was	doubtful	he'd	find</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything	 there.	 Whoever	 had	 brought	 the	 woman	 in	 here	 had	 decided	 to	 dump</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	body	on	the	first	available	trolley	and	leave	it	there.	The	boots	turned	out	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	empty	and	there	was	nothing	in	the	socks,	either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	wrong?”	Estelle	asked	as	Chaz	let	an	empty	boot	fall	to	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn't	 it	 obvious?	 I	 can't	 find	 the	 card,”	 Chaz	 said,	 acknowledging	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">commanding	 officer	 for	 the	 first	 time	 since	 entering	 the	 morgue.	 He	 began	 to dump	more	items	on	the	floor	and	the	gurney	as	his	search	continued. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p249"></a>Knowing	 that	 his	 help	 was	 not	 wanted,	 Dodds	 left	 the	 others	 to	 continue sorting	through	Barber's	possessions	and	pulled	back	a	sheet	that	was	covering	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">body	on	another	gurney,	opposite	that	of	Barber's. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chaz,	how	did	she	die?”	Dodds	asked,	looking	down	into	the	scar-riddled</p>
<p class="calibre1">face	of	the	dead	man	he	had	uncovered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	a	pause,	then,	“A	man	killed	her,”	he	said,	his	voice	bitter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 man?”	 Dodds	 asked,	 indicating	 the	 body.	 Chaz	 and	 the	 other	 three</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	glanced	around,	seeing	the	exposed	body	with	its	long	coat	and	clothes</p>
<p class="calibre1">even	more	bloodstained	than	Barber's	vest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	killed	him	at	the	same	time.	That's	all	I	know,”	Chaz	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	answer	was	good	enough	for	Dodds.	“This	is	our	man.	This	is	the	guy</p>
<p class="calibre1">who	blew	up	 <i class="calibre4">Cardinal</i>.”	He	began	to	rifle	through	the	pockets	of	the	man	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">table.	Enrique	and	Estelle	hurried	over	to	join	him	in	his	quest	to	locate	the	data</p>
<p class="calibre1">card,	but	after	a	thorough	search	they	failed	to	locate	anything.	Just	as	Chaz	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">done,	 they	 also	 checked	 boots,	 socks	 and	 other	 possible	 hiding	 places,	 to	 no avail. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Kelly	caught	Chaz's	eye	as	she	stood	out	of	the	way,	still	quite	unnerved	by	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">dead	bodies.	He	gave	her	a	look	that	emphasised	his	utter	frustration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Want	 me	 to	 take	 a	 look?”	 she	 offered,	 although	 she	 asked	 only	 out	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">politeness	 and	 courtesy,	 and	 not	 because	 she	 wanted	 to	 be	 involved.	 She</p>
<p class="calibre1">regretted	it	seconds	later	when	Chaz	walked	back	from	the	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go	ahead,”	he	gestured	at	Barber's	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly	 approached	 and	 began	 her	 own	 search,	 rechecking	 everywhere	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	 had	 already,	 though	 much	 more	 gingerly	 and	 with	 added	 caution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whenever	 confronted	 with	 a	 dead	 body,	 she	 couldn't	 help	 but	 think	 that	 at	 any moment	 the	 eyes	 would	 fly	 open	 and	 stare	 straight	 at	 her,	 or	 that	 a	 sick	 smile would	 crawl	 up	 the	 face,	 the	 grin	 directed	 at	 and	 meant	 for	 her,	 or	 that	 a	 cold, dead	hand	would	shoot	out	and	grab	her	wrist... </p>
<p class="calibre1">She	 shook	 the	 images	 from	 her	 head	 and	 tried	 not	 to	 think	 about	 it.	 Dead</p>

<p class="calibre1">preparing	 to	 accept	 that	 Barber	 was	 in	 possession	 of	 the	 card,	 and	 not	 the	 man whom	they	searched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	think	someone	else	might	have	taken	it	from	her?”	Dodds	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well,	 they	 didn't	 take	 anything	 else,”	 Estelle	 said,	 nodding	 toward	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">numerous	 belongings	 Chaz	 had	 removed	 from	 the	 woman.	 “If	 they	 couldn't	 be</p>

<p class="calibre1">“There	are	no	hidden	compartments	in	her	boots,”	Chaz	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gloves?	 She's	 a	 spy,	 after	 all,	 so	 there's	 bound	 to	 be	 at	 least	 one	 secret hiding	place...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	aren't	any,”	Chaz	said	through	gritted	teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe	it's	in	the	lining	of	her	jacket?	Or	around	the	collar?	Could	even	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">tucked	into	her	bra...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can	it,	Dodds,”	Estelle	said,	patting	at	the	raider's	long	coat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	sure	she's	not	just	holding	it	in	her	hand?”	Enrique	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	gave	him	a	look	of	disdain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	seriously,”	Enrique	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She	  <i class="calibre4">is</i>	 holding	 something,”	 Kelly	 said.	 She	 was	 staring	 at	 Barber's	 right hand	that,	unlike	the	left,	was	closed	up.	Dodds	and	Estelle	left	the	raider's	body</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	came	to	stand	by	Barber	once	more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 took	 the	 woman's	 hand	 and	 inspected	 it.	 “Looks	 like	 plastic.”	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">tried	to	prise	her	hand	open,	but	found	it	so	stiff	as	to	be	unable	to	even	move</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	finger.	After	a	while,	he	was	able	to	push	his	own	little	finger	between	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">gap	in	Barber's	grip	and	poked	the	object	out.	It	fell	and	bounced	gently	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">floor.	He	retrieved	it	and	held	it	up	for	the	others	to	see. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	is	it?”	Estelle	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Some	kind	of	tiny	bottle,”	Dodds	said,	turning	the	clear	container	between</p>

<p class="calibre1">still	clung	to	the	inside.	Estelle	took	it	from	him,	almost	dropping	it	as	it	slipped</p>
<p class="calibre1">between	her	fingers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's...	it's	lubricant,”	she	said,	sounding	more	than	a	little	confused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah	ha!	I've	got	it!”	Enrique	said,	the	four	others	turning	around	to	the	man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	grandfather	once	told	me	that	spies	sometimes	don't	keep	really	important</p>

<p class="calibre1">Dodds'	 eyes	 went	 back	 to	 Barber	 as	 Enrique	 solved	 the	 mystery	 of	 the	 card's location. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Estelle	said	nothing,	not	blaming	Dodds	for	refusing	to	do	as	she	said.	She</p>

<p class="calibre1">He	 looked	 up	 into	 the	 bright	 red	 eyes	 of	 the	 eerie	 black	 helmet	 as	 the	 shotgun was	swung	in	his	direction.	A	moment	later,	he	found	himself	staring	down	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">barrel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	heard	a	bang,	followed	by	a	grunt.	The	shotgun	fell	away	and	the	soldier</p>
<p class="calibre1">stumbled	 backward.	 Three	 further	 explosions	 followed,	 accompanied	 by	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">number	 of	 cries	 of	 pain	 from	 behind	 the	 black	 helmet,	 before	 the	 solider	 fell backward	 and	 crashed	 down	 onto	 the	 floor.	 Dodds	 saw	 blood	 glistening	 on	 the black	suit	as	it	began	to	pour	from	wounds	and	onto	the	floor,	creating	a	small</p>
<p class="calibre1">pool.	 Despite	 appearances	 otherwise,	 the	 soldier	 was	 clearly	 not	 wearing	 any</p>
<p class="calibre1">form	of	body	armour,	and	the	suit	had	provided	him	with	little	protection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	looked	around	to	see	Estelle,	panting	and	steadying	a	pistol	in	both</p>
<p class="calibre1">hands.	He	recognised	it	as	the	gun	that	had	belonged	to	Barber	and	remembered</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	 removing	 it	 from	 its	 holster	 inside	 the	 woman's	 jacket,	 during	 his	 search for	the	data	card.	Estelle	must	have	picked	it	up	during	the	scramble	to	hide.	She</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	 down	 at	 him	 as	 the	 others	 emerged	 from	 their	 hurried	 and	 uninspiring hiding	places.	Her	eyes	held	a	mixture	of	feelings;	his,	only	an	apology. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">As	 Enrique	 had	 relayed	 the	 warning	 of	 the	 soldier's	 impending	 arrival	 to	 the mortuary,	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	 had	 wrenched	 off	 their	 propulsion	 packs	 and	 hidden beneath	 the	 sheets	 of	 the	 spare	 gurnies,	 feigning	 their	 own	 deaths.	 Their	 packs had	been	thrown	into	a	corner,	next	to	a	locker,	and	each	of	their	flight	helmets</p>
<p class="calibre1">dropped	under	their	respective	gurnies.	There	had	only	been	four	empty	trolleys, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p262"></a>and	 Chaz	 had	 pulled	 the	 raider's	 body	 off	 his	 table	 and	 pushed	 him	 into	 the locker.	 Though	 there	 had	 been	 no	 time	 to	 hide	 any	 evidence	 of	 their	 recent activities,	 Dodds,	 Estelle,	 Kelly	 and	 Enrique	 had	 hoped	 that	 the	 soldier	 would take	one	look	around	and	then	leave;	though,	from	his	behaviour,	Chaz	seemed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 have	 expected	 otherwise.	 Their	 saving	 grace	 had	 come	 in	 the	 form	 of	 the raider	Chaz	had	put	in	the	locker.	His	hurried	bundling	of	the	man's	body	into	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">storage	cabinet	had	resulted	in	it	crumpling	down,	knocking	against	the	insides</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	it	did	so.	The	soldier	had	gone	on	to	mistake	the	corpse's	sliding	for	someone</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying	to	hide	themselves	away. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“We've	got	to	get	out	of	here,”	Chaz	said,	throwing	off	his	sheet.	He	glanced	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	direction	of	the	fallen	soldier	lying	still	on	the	floor,	on	top	of	the	body	of	the raider.	He	hesitated,	for	a	time	caught	up	an	internal	debate	as	to	which	task	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">should	 be	 attending	 to	 first.	 He	 then	 headed	 back	 over	 to	 the	 gurney	 on	 which Barber's	body	rested,	snatching	up	the	scalpel	from	where	it	lay	on	the	floor	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	went. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 jacket	 already	 undone,	 he	 used	 the	 scalpel	 to	 cut	 apart	 Barber's</p>
<p class="calibre1">bloodstained	 vest,	 but	 stopped	 short	 of	 cutting	 into	 her	 flesh.	 He	 once	 again stared	down	at	Barber's	smooth	white	skin,	finding	it	too	hard	to	carry	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 task	 laid	 before	 him.	 He	 felt	 how	 cold	 she	 was	 as	 his	 fingers	 brushed	 her stomach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chaz,”	Estelle	started	again,	fiddling	with	the	pistol	she	still	held.	“If	you</p>
<p class="calibre1">can't	do	it...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can.	Just	give	me	a	second,”	he	answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“...	I	can	do	it	instead,”	Estelle	finished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	SAID	GIVE	ME	A	DAMN	SECOND!”	Chaz	shouted	back	in	frustration</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 his	 pending	 task.	 He	 stood	 breathing	 for	 a	 while,	 concentrating	 hard	 and searching	for	the	will	to	begin.	After	just	a	few	seconds	of	mental	preparation,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">found	 it	 and	 immediately	 plunged	 the	 scalpel	 into	 Barber's	 belly.	 He	 began</p>
<p class="calibre1">cutting	 downwards,	 working	 fast	 and	 making	 jagged	 sawing	 actions	 with	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">blade	as	he	went.	The	world	around	him	seemed	to	disappear.	He	heard	nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	saw	nothing	but	the	knife;	almost	slipping	into	a	trance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	sorry,”	he	said	under	his	breath.	“I'm	so	sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p263"></a>*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey,	you	okay?”	Enrique	asked	as	Dodds	struggled	to	his	feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,”	Dodds	said,	even	though	he	was	not	so	sure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	face	is	really	bruised,”	Kelly	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	touched	the	side	of	his	face,	feeling	it	hot	and	a	little	swollen.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">power	 of	 the	 blow	 had	 been	 tremendous	 and	 he	 found	 himself	 amazed	 that	 the force	had	bowled	him	over.	He	was	counting	himself	lucky	that	he	had	not	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">knocked	 out.	 He	 recalled	 during	 his	 struggle	 with	 the	 soldier	 over	 the	 shotgun that	his	feet	had	almost	been	lifted	off	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 looked	 over	 to	 where	 Estelle	 and	 Chaz	 were	 standing	 over	 the	 gurney. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz's	hands	were	already	covered	in	blood	and,	though	she	was	overseeing	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">task,	 he	 could	 tell	 that	 Estelle	 was	 fighting	 the	 urge	 to	 turn	 away.	 Chaz's	 eyes appeared	to	be	glazed	over	as	he	drove	the	knife	deeper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	found	himself	compelled	to	investigate	his	opponent	and	wandered</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	to	the	soldier's	unmoving	body.	The	man	still	held	the	shotgun	in	one	hand</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	Dodds	kicked	it	away	before	he	squatted	down.	He	noted	that	the	soldier's</p>
<p class="calibre1">suit,	which	he	had	originally	mistaken	to	have	been	a	construct	of	ceramics,	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	 fact	 composed	 of	 little	 else	 but	 leather.	 It	 was	 thicker	 in	 some	 areas	 than others,	extra	smooth,	hardened	padding	on	the	shoulders,	elbows,	kneecaps	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	 parts	 of	 the	 body,	 giving	 the	 impression	 of	 armour	 plating.	 The	 texture varied	 in	 places,	 most	 often	 around	 where	 one	 part	 of	 the	 plates	 joined	 to another,	as	well	as	around	joints. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	doing?”	Kelly	asked	in	a	suspicious	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	want	to	see	what	this	bastard	looks	like,”	Dodds	said,	eager	to	see	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">lay	 beneath	 that	 ominous-looking	 black	 helmet.	 It	 was	 round	 in	 shape	 and	 all encompassing,	 betraying	 none	 of	 the	 wearer's	 appearance	 to	 the	 world	 outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two	tubes	and	a	thin	black	cable	ran	off	the	back,	feeding	into	the	main	suit.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	as	though	the	tubes	existed	to	aid	with	respiration,	although	since	Dodds</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	never	seen	anything	like	it	before,	they	could	have	existed	for	any	purpose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	found	they	were	all	easily	unclipped	and,	after	doing	so,	slipped	the	helmet</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	the	soldier's	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow,”	Kelly	said,	drawing	closer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	could	not	say	what	he	had	been	expecting	to	find	beneath	the	mask, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 he	 had	 not	 anticipated	 this:	 the	 peaceful-looking	 face	 of	 the	 man	 that	 he looked	upon	was	-	in	a	word	-	beautiful.	The	man's	skin	was	flawless,	with	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">moles,	scars	or	even	any	signs	of	stubble	present	anywhere;	not	even	the	tiniest</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 cuts	 or	 imperfections.	 The	 skin	 was	 so	 smooth	 and	 healthy-looking	 that	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p264"></a>man	could	well	have	been	wearing	make-up.	The	man	was	dark-skinned,	the	hair on	 the	 top	 of	 his	 head	 short	 and	 almost	 unbelievably	 uniform	 in	 length.	 He looked	more	like	a	model	than	a	soldier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	 that?”	 Enrique	 asked,	 drawing	 Dodds	 and	 Kelly	 away	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">man's	 face.	 On	 the	 left	 breast	 of	 the	 soldier's	 suit	 was	 a	 white	 emblem	 unlike anything	they	had	seen	before:	contained	within	a	circle	was	an	outline	of	a	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">holding	a	spear	in	front	of	him.	Both	of	the	man's	hands	gripped	the	shaft	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">weapon,	his	left	higher	up	the	shaft	than	the	right.	The	spear	was	set	at	a	shallow</p>
<p class="calibre1">angle,	the	tip	pointing	to	the	top	left	of	the	circle.	A	sash,	tied	at	the	top	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shaft	 just	 below	 the	 point,	 curled	 its	 way	 around	 the	 man's	 body.	 The	 man</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself	was	bald	and	appeared	to	be	naked,	apart	from	where	the	sash	preserved</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	modesty;	though	the	man	was	depicted	more	or	less	from	the	waist	up,	so	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	difficult	to	tell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	stared	at	the	emblem	for	a	moment	and	then	ran	his	fingers	over	it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">feeling	the	raised	outlines	of	the	image. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That's	not	an	Imperial	insignia	I	recognise,”	Enrique	said,	his	own	fingers</p>
<p class="calibre1">working	over	the	emblem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	I've	never	seen	that	one	before,	either,”	Kelly	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither	 had	 Dodds.	 Like	 most,	 he	 was	 more	 accustomed	 to	 the	 noisy</p>
<p class="calibre1">Imperial	Coat	of	Arms,	being	a	clutter	of	swords,	laurels,	felines	and	just	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything	 else	 the	 designer	 had	 been	 able	 to	 cram	 into	 the	 space	 the	 design afforded.	 This	 symbol	 by	 contrast	 was	 a	 lot	 simpler	 than	 that,	 though	 not	 as simple	 as	 the	 designs	 of	 the	 CSN,	 UNF,	 or	 indeed	 the	 INF	 themselves,	 those being	composed	of	nothing	more	than	the	disjunction	of	a	few	basic	shapes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There's	another	one	on	his	right	arm,”	Dodds	said,	comparing	it	to	the	first</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 discovering	 them	 to	 be	 identical.	 He	 looked	 over	 at	 the	 helmet	 he	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">removed	from	the	man,	but	discovered	that	it	was	devoid	of	any	such	markings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 peeked	 inside,	 unsurprised	 to	 discover	 its	 main	 purpose	 being	 to	 serve	 as protection	 for	 the	 wearer's	 head.	 He	 noted	 the	 eye	 sockets	 within,	 the	 insides being	clear	unlike	the	red	exterior.	Two	circular	grilles	on	each	side	at	ear	level</p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared	to	aid	hearing.	What	looked	like	a	small	inset,	unmarked	button	resided</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	left	temple.	He	put	the	helmet	back	down,	more	intrigued	with	the	strange</p>
<p class="calibre1">white	pictorial	image	on	the	suit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he	 and	 Enrique	 continued	 to	 try	 and	 make	 sense	 of	 the	 emblem,	 Kelly</p>
<p class="calibre1">reached	down	to	the	man's	right	leg	and	removed	the	weapon	holstered	there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	you	got	there?”	Enrique	asked	the	small	woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Think	it's	a	plasma	pistol,”	she	said,	wandering	back	towards	Estelle	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz,	turning	it	around	in	her	hand	as	she	examined	it.	“Looks	like	a	high-power</p>
<p class="calibre1">version.”	 There	 was	 a	 low,	 high-pitched	 whine	 as	 she	 switched	 it	 on,	 a	 small</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p265"></a>digital	counter	on	the	side	lighting	up	to	display	the	number	of	shots	remaining in	the	energy	capsule.	“Got	a	full	clip,	too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Careful</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 was	 Chaz.	 Dodds	 looked	 over	 to	 see	 that	 the	 sound	 had	 broken	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">concentration	and	that	he	had	stopped	cutting,	turning	his	attention	from	Barber's</p>
<p class="calibre1">stomach	to	where	Kelly	stood	holding	the	gun.	The	big	man's	hands	were	even</p>
<p class="calibre1">more	blood	sodden	now,	covered	up	to	the	wrists.	He	was	looking	at	Kelly	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">an	irritated	expression	on	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	two	doing?”	he	asked	of	Dodds	and	Enrique,	who	were	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">knelt	over	the	unmoving	body	of	the	invader. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	taking	a	look,”	Dodds	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	make	sure	he's	actually	dead!”	Chaz	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh?”	Enrique	said.	He	met	Dodds'	eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	was	an	odd	thing	to	say.	Dodds	glanced	about	to	see	all	eyes	were	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz,	 the	 three	 other	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>,	 like	 himself,	 a	 little	 bewildered	 by	 his	 strange comment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	did	you	say?”	Kelly	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just	as	Dodds	was	about	to	press	Chaz	further	with	a	question	of	his	own,	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">strange	 noise	 beside	 him	 drew	 him	 back	 to	 the	 body.	 Something	 clattered, </p>
<p class="calibre1">bounced	and	then	rolled	along	the	floor.	It	was	followed	by	another	very	similar</p>
<p class="calibre1">sound	 and	 this	 time	 the	 “something”	 rolled	 into	 his	 fingers.	 Looking	 down,	 he saw	 a	 bullet.	 Dodds	 picked	 it	 up,	 and	 discovered	 it	 to	 be	 wet	 and	 sticky	 as	 he rolled	it	around	between	his	fingers.	The	bullet,	just	like	his	fingers	now	were, </p>
<p class="calibre1">was	covered	in	blood.	His	eyes	followed	the	faint	splotches	of	blood	on	the	floor</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	where	he	had	retrieved	it,	tracing	them	back	to	the	soldier's	body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	the	hell...”	Dodds	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	my	God!	Dodds!”	Enrique	cried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	looked	back	in	time	to	see	the	eyes	of	the	soldier	fly	open.	The	very</p>
<p class="calibre1">next	moment,	and	with	incredible	speed,	a	hand	shot	up	and	grabbed	him	tight</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	 the	 throat.	 Dodds	 choked	 as	 the	 soldier	 easily	 got	 to	 his	 feet,	 still maintaining	a	tight	hold	on	him,	even	as	Dodds	tugged	against	the	hand	holding</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	soldier's	other	hand	fumbled	about	his	right	leg,	closing	several	times</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	nothing	as	he	tried	to	locate	his	missing	gun.	Realising	it	had	been	taken</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 him,	 he	 looked	 about	 until	 he	 spotted	 it	 in	 the	 hands	 of	 Kelly.	 He	 also caught	sight	of	his	shotgun,	hidden	beneath	a	gurney	where	Dodds	had	kicked	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	minimal	effort,	he	threw	Dodds	from	him,	attempting	to	knock	down</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 small	 woman	 that	 was	 staring	 open-mouthed	 at	 the	 unfolding	 scene.	 The</p>
<p class="calibre1">woman	reacted	much	faster	to	the	incoming	body	than	she	had	to	the	incoming</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p266"></a>Imperial	fighter	earlier	that	day,	and	Dodds	crashed	to	the	floor,	skidding	along past	where	Estelle	and	Chaz	stood	over	Barber's	gurney,	still	trying	to	discover</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	whereabouts	of	the	data	card. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique	saw	Dodds	land,	roll	and	then	remain	still,	before	he	turned	back	to	face</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	man	who	had	just	got	back	on	his	feet.	He	raised	his	guard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	one	of	his	opponents	out	of	the	way,	the	soldier	turned	his	attention	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique,	the	blonde-haired	man	now	the	only	thing	that	stood	between	him	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 armaments.	 Weaponless,	 but	 not	 altogether	 outnumbered,	 the	 soldier	 fell</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	on	his	fists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique	 avoided	 the	 first	 blow,	 as	 well	 as	 the	 follow-up,	 before	 returning</p>
<p class="calibre1">three	of	his	own	into	his	opponent's	face.	He	held	back	none	of	his	power	as	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">struck	the	man,	the	blows	he	dealt	enough	to	floor	many	of	those	he	had	sparred</p>
<p class="calibre1">against	in	the	past	few	years,	almost	certainly	knocking	them	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 combination	 over,	 he	 hopped	 back,	 only	 to	 see	 that	 his	 opponent	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">still	standing,	the	strikes	not	having	had	the	effect	that	he	desired.	No	blood,	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">sweat,	 not	 so	 much	 as	 even	 a	 grunt.	 Nothing.	 The	 soldier	 had	 not	 so	 much	 as even	 reeled	 from	 the	 blows.	 Enrique	 suddenly	 felt	 as	 though	 he	 were	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">featherweight	boxer,	pitched	against	a	super-heavyweight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	was	then	that	he	noticed	just	how	big	and	tall	the	soldier	actually	was.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">seemed	that	even	Dodds,	who	had	tackled	him	earlier,	had	not	found	the	time	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">appreciate	the	height	of	the	man.	He	was	just	as	big	as	Chaz	and	also	as	stocky, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	with	something	else	added.	Enrique	had	sparred	with	Chaz	many	times	and, </p>
<p class="calibre1">on	more	than	one	occasion,	the	big	man	had	called	time	outs	when	Enrique	took</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	too	far.	Enrique	knew	there	would	be	no	such	call	here,	however;	not	because</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	pair	were	fighting	for	their	lives,	but	simply	because	the	soldier	did	not	need</p>
<p class="calibre1">one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 soldier	 once	 again	 swung	 at	 him,	 as	 if	 nothing	 had	 happened.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">managed	 to	 parry	 the	 attack,	 but	 failed	 to	 land	 his	 own	 counterattack.	 The	 two then	 engaged	 in	 a	 more	 serious	 fight,	 fists	 flying,	 legs	 attempting	 to	 connect kicks,	grapples	made	and	broken.	Enrique's	face	betrayed	his	situation,	stunned</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	 the	 fact	 that	 the	 soldier	 was	 still	 standing.	 He	 knew	 he	 was	 not	 going	 to	 be able	to	hold	off	the	soldier	for	very	long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Estelle,	 shoot	 him!”	 he	 called,	 ducking	 under	 a	 swing	 and	 looking	 to	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">wing	commander	for	assistance. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p267"></a>“I	can't,	it's	empty!”	Estelle	shouted	back.	She	looked	back	at	the	clutter	of items	next	to	the	gurney,	unable	to	recall	seeing	any	more	magazines;	although</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 might	 be	 in	 there,	 somewhere.	 She	 did	 the	 only	 thing	 she	 could	 think	 of, and	with	all	her	might,	she	threw	the	pistol	at	the	soldier's	head.	It	missed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks!”	Enrique	said	as	the	gun	bounced	off	the	wall	and	clattered	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 soldier	 caught	 Enrique's	 leg	 as	 he	 attempted	 to	 deliver	 a	 kick	 to	 him, tipping	Enrique	backward.	He	crashed	into	the	gurney	behind	him,	overturning</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	metal	trolley	and	causing	it	to	smash	onto	its	side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	 ran,	 seeing	 the	 shotgun	 exposed	 and	 anticipating	 the	 soldier's	 next</p>
<p class="calibre1">move.	 Reaching	 it	 first,	 she	 kicked	 it	 further	 back	 up	 the	 room	 before	 then attempting	 to	 take	 the	 man	 on,	 herself,	 hoping	 to	 give	 Enrique	 a	 chance	 to	 get back	to	his	feet. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Their	plight	had	not	gone	unnoticed	by	Chaz,	who	was	working	faster	than	ever</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	that	the	urgency	of	the	situation	had	reached	new	heights.	Just	as	he	thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 wasn't	 going	 to	 find	 anything,	 his	 fingers	 closed	 around	 something	 small, solid	and	cylindrical.	Drawing	it	out	and	wiping	away	blood,	he	discovered	it	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	 some	 sort	 of	 tiny	 plastic	 capsule.	 Inside	 was	 something	 thin	 and	 blue.	 That was	good	enough	for	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stepping	 back	 from	 Barber's	 body,	 he	 saw	 that	 the	 soldier	 was	 starting	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">overcome	Enrique,	the	black-clad	invader	landing	two	successive	punches	across</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	man's	face.	Enrique	cried	out	with	the	blows	and	stumbled	backward.	Estelle</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	lying	on	the	floor	behind	him,	the	wind	knocked	out	of	her	from	a	boot	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	stomach,	her	reward	for	coming	to	Enrique's	aid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	are	you	standing	there	for?”	he	shouted	at	Kelly,	who	had	remained</p>
<p class="calibre1">rooted	 to	 the	 spot	 following	 the	 soldier's	 miraculous	 resurrection.	 She	 did	 not seem	to	even	hear	Chaz	or	be	aware	of	anything,	until	he	wrenched	the	plasma</p>
<p class="calibre1">pistol	from	her	hands	and	shoved	her	aside,	lining	himself	up	with	the	soldier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Enrique,	get	down!”	he	barked	at	the	man	up	front.	Enrique	did	not	need	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">be	told	twice	and	fell	backward,	away	from	his	enemy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	proceeded	to	fire	the	pistol	three	times:	the	first	bolt	struck	the	soldier</p>
<p class="calibre1">square	 in	 the	 face;	 the	 second	 tore	 straight	 through	 his	 right	 temple;	 the	 third shot	struck	the	soldier	in	the	forehead,	almost	taking	the	top	of	his	skull	off.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">man's	 lifeless	 body	 tottered	 for	 a	 fraction	 of	 a	 second	 before	 it	 slumped	 down</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p268"></a>onto	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	 strode	 forward,	 ignoring	 everyone	 else	 and	 knelt	 over	 the	 body, </p>
<p class="calibre1">keeping	 the	 pistol	 trained	 on	 it	 the	 whole	 time.	 After	 some	 inspection,	 he	 was satisfied	 that	 the	 soldier	 was	 now	 dead.	 He	 then	 started	 looting	 the	 man's	 suit, pulling	out	all	of	the	various	items	that	were	contained	within	and	about	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>

<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 pulled	 himself	 to	 his	 feet	 once	 more,	 his	 back	 sore	 from	 the	 landing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique	flipped	over	and	started	to	stand,	moving	to	help	Estelle	who	was	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">trying	to	draw	breath.	He	caught	Dodds'	eye	as	he	did	so,	glancing	at	Chaz	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	back	again,	wanting	to	know,	as	Dodds,	the	same	thing:	 <i class="calibre4">Where	the	hell	did</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">he	learn	to	fire	a	gun	like	that? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">His	 short-known	 team	 mate	 had	 handled	 the	 firearm	 as	 if	 it	 was	 second</p>
<p class="calibre1">nature	 to	 him;	 as	 though	 he	 had	 used	 it	 every	 single	 day	 for	 years	 and	 years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whilst	 Estelle	 had	 held	 Barber's	 pistol	 as	 though	 it	 burned	 her	 hand,	 Chaz	 had wielded	 the	 gun	 with	 total	 confidence.	 And	 the	 accuracy	 of	 the	 shots	 he	 had gone	on	to	fire,	had	more	than	asserted	his	marksmanship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	rubbed	the	back	of	his	head	and	looked	on	at	the	carnage	in	front	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.	 What	 he	 had	 just	 seen	 was	 impossible:	 Estelle	 had	 shot	 the	 invader	 four times,	landing	all	the	bullets	in	the	torso.	Yet	a	few	minutes	later,	the	man	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	on	his	feet	as	if	nothing	had	happened.	He	spotted	one	of	the	bullets	that	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">believed	 had	 been	 embedded	 in	 the	 man,	 now	 resting	 on	 the	 floor	 close	 to	 the body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had	the	bullet	missed?	No,	it	couldn't	have.	There	had	been	blood,	the	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 fallen.	 He	 had	 heard	 the	 cries	 of	 pain	 behind	 the	 mask.	 The	 bullet	 he	 had picked	 up	 had	 also	 been	 sticky	 with	 blood	 and	 the	 man's	 suit	 had	 been	 torn where	 the	 projectile	 had	 entered.	 Surely	 he	 couldn't	 have	 imagined	 all	 of	 that. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">And	 the	 strength! </i>	 If	 it	 weren't	 for	 the	 pain	 in	 his	 lower	 back	 -	 he	 considered himself	 lucky	 he	 could	 still	 walk	 -	 he	 might	 not	 have	 believed	 how	 far	 he	 had travelled	 with	 the	 throw,	 either.	 He	 felt	 at	 his	 aching	 throat.	 It	 was	 painful	 to swallow.	He	was	certain	that	beneath	the	lining	of	the	flight	suit,	there	would	be</p>
<p class="calibre1">some	rather	pronounced	bruising. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	man	was	dead!	Estelle	shot	him	down!	How	the	hell	did	he	get	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">up?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whilst	 Dodds	 was	 silently	 considering	 everything	 that	 had	 just	 happened, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly	 was	 voicing	 her	 opinions	 aloud.	 Enrique	 made	 his	 way	 over	 to	 reassure</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p269"></a>her,	 as	 she	 pointed	 at	 the	 still	 corpse	 of	 the	 solider	 Chaz	 was	 plundering.	 She looked	 a	 little	 hysterical,	 as	 if	 her	 worst	 fear	 of	 dead	 bodies	 had	 at	 last	 been realised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is	he	really	dead	now?”	Kelly	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He's	dead,”	Enrique	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Are	you	sure? </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	he	is,	calm	down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	do	you	know	he's	not	going	to	get	back	up	again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	don't	think	he'll	be	getting	up	after	that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah,	but	we	thought	that	after	Estelle	put	four	damn	bullets	into	him...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are	 you	 okay,	 Enrique,”	 Dodds	 asked	 above	 Kelly's	 ramblings,	 as	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">stumbled	forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine.	Are	you	all	right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	in	the	direction	of	the	two	corpses	on	the	floor	by	the	locker.	“I</p>
<p class="calibre1">meant	what	I	said	earlier:	should	bloody	well	have	stayed	in	bed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	was	that	all	about?”	Enrique	wanted	to	know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don't	know.	I've	got	about	a	hundred	thousand	questions,	but	answers	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">I	could	count	on	one	hand.”	He	realised	his	voice	was	shaking.	But	then,	so	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">everyone	else's.	“Did	that	really	just	happen?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique	nodded,	an	arm	around	Kelly,	rubbing	her	back.	Dodds	left	them	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	and	made	his	way	over	to	where	the	solider	had	fallen.	He	caught	a	glimpse	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	 remained	 of	 the	 man's	 head	 before	 turning	 away.	 He	 spotted	 some	 more</p>
<p class="calibre1">red-stained	 brass-coloured	 objects	 on	 the	 floor.	 Two	 more	 bullets;	 that	 made</p>
<p class="calibre1">three.	 He	 had	 no	 idea	 what	 might	 have	 happened	 to	 the	 fourth.	 One	 hundred</p>
<p class="calibre1">thousand	and	one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	 was	 still	 removing	 things	 from	 the	 soldier.	 He	 had	 so	 far	 collected</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	looked	like	four	grenades	and	a	fuel	cell	for	the	plasma	pistol.	Other	items</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	being	tossed	aside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chaz,	 where's	 the	 card?	 Did	 you	 get	 it?”	 Estelle	 asked	 through	 sharp</p>
<p class="calibre1">intakes	of	breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	continued	to	search,	ignoring	her	question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chaz?”	Estelle	asked	again	louder,	rubbing	at	her	stomach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">What? </i>”	 he	 roared,	 looking	 back	 at	 her,	 anger	 and	 impatience	 clear	 in	 his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	not	speak	to	me	that	way,	Lieutenant!”	Estelle	said,	the	stress	causing</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	own	temper	to	flare.	“Did	you	find	the	data	card?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	 tossed	 the	 capsule	 in	 her	 direction.	 She	 caught	 it	 and	 wiped	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">remains	 of	 the	 blood	 away,	 revealing	 the	 contents.	 She	 caught	 Dodds'	 eye	 and held	 it	 up	 as	 if	 requiring	 a	 second	 opinion.	 He	 nodded;	 he	 could	 see	 the	 small</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p270"></a>blue	card	within	was	marked	with	the	Confederation	insignia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,	we've	got	what	we	came	for,”	she	stated,	and	began	to	secure	it	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">her	flight	suit.	“I	think	what	it	might	be	worth	us	doing	is	trying	to	contact...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	we	 <i class="calibre4">have</i>	to	do	is	get	out	of	here	 <i class="calibre4">now</i>,”	Chaz	said,	snatching	up	the items	 he	 had	 removed	 from	 the	 soldier's	 body	 and	 stuffing	 them	 into	 various compartments	and	pockets	of	his	own	flight	suit.	“Enrique:	how	many	more	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">you	see?”	he	asked	as	he	set	about	retrieving	the	shotgun	from	where	it	lay	under</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	gurney. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Four,	maybe	five,”	Enrique	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	swore,	then	looked	around	the	morgue,	his	face	becoming	quite	grim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doesn't	look	like	there	is	any	way	out	of	here	except	for	the	way	we	came	in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	glanced	at	the	shotgun	in	his	hand	and	then	turned	back	to	the	group,	his	eyes</p>
<p class="calibre1">flickering	 over	 each	 of	 them.	 He	 then	 turned	 back	 to	 Enrique.	 “Do	 you	 know how	to	use	one	of	these?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure,”	Enrique	said.	“I've	done	my	fair	share	on	the	firing	range.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	tossed	the	shotgun	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Magazine	holds	seven	rounds,	but	it	has	a	low	effective	range,	so	anything</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	about	twenty-five	meters	is	hardly	going	to	be	worth	shooting	at;	especially</p>
<p class="calibre1">if	 you	 don't	 have	 a	 steady	 aim.	 Don't	 waste	 it	 on	 pot-shots,	 it	 won't	 do	 us	 any good.	Only	use	it	when	I	tell	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 tone	 in	 his	 voice	 let	 Dodds	 know	 this	 was	 far	 more	 than	 just	 a	 mere</p>
<p class="calibre1">suggestion.	Enrique	nodded	as	he	began	to	familiarize	himself	with	the	handling</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 weapon,	 turning	 it	 over	 and	 bouncing	 it	 in	 his	 hands	 to	 feel	 the	 weight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	looked	at	Chaz	in	confusion.	It	seemed	that	the	big	man	knew	a	lot	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">than	he	was	willing	to	let	on,	but	quite	why,	he	didn't	know.	His	usual	silent	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">steady	 demeanour	 had	 abandoned	 him,	 and	 Dodds	 wondered	 if	 they	 were	 now</p>
<p class="calibre1">seeing	his	true	colours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	pointed	at	the	body.	“Chaz,	that	guy...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do	you	really	want	to	stand	around	and	talk	about	this	now?”	Chaz	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	didn't. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right,	 everyone	 ready?”	 Chaz	 asked,	 as	 he	 started	 off	 to	 retrieve	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">equipment.	“We're	not	exactly	going	to	have	an	easy	time	getting	out	of	here	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	piece.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lieutenant,	 what	 the	 hell!”	 Estelle	 snapped,	 a	 furious	 expression	 on	 her</p>
<p class="calibre1">face.	“Don't	make	me	remind	you	who	is	in	charge	of	this	mission,	Mr	Koonan! </p>
<p class="calibre1">I	am	a	 <i class="calibre4">first</i>	lieutenant,	you	are	a	 <i class="calibre4">second</i>	lieutenant;	I	am	the	wing	commander	of the	 <i class="calibre4">White	Knights</i>	and	I	won't	have	you	giving	orders	to	my	team	whilst...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 reached	 out	 and	 took	 a	 grip	 of	 her	 shoulder,	 prompting	 her	 to	 stop</p>
<p class="calibre1">talking. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p271"></a>“Estelle,	 I	 really	 feel	 that	 right	 now	 we	 should	 be	 listening	 to	 Chaz,”	 he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	glared	back	at	Dodds	before	her	eyes	strayed	to	the	body	of	the	dead</p>
<p class="calibre1">soldier	 on	 the	 floor.	 She	 stood	 in	 silence	 for	 a	 time,	 looking	 from	 Dodds,	 to Chaz,	to	the	body.	She	then	shrugged	Dodds'	hand	from	her	shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fine,	 we'll	 follow	 your	 lead,	 Chaz,”	 she	 said	 with	 reluctance.	 “For	 now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	once	we	get	out	of	here,	you	will	have	a	lot	of	explaining	to	do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	 acknowledged	 her	 with	 a	 mere	 nod	 of	 his	 head	 before	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">retrieved	their	gear	and	made	their	way	from	the	mortuary.	On	the	way	out	Chaz</p>
<p class="calibre1">paused,	and	then	turned	around	and	walked	back	to	Barber's	gurney.	He	picked</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	linen	sheet	off	the	floor	and	spread	it	back	over	her	body,	bending	down	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">give	her	a	kiss	on	the	forehead	before	covering	her	completely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 studied	 him	 as	 he	 did	 all	 of	 this,	 but	 Chaz	 gave	 no	 explanation	 for his	actions;	and	neither	did	Dodds	seek	to	ask. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><b class="calibre3">T</b>he	 infirmary	 lay	 still	 and	 quiet,	 and	 as	 Dodds	 continued	 his	 slow,	 crouched walk	 towards	 the	 main	 door,	 he	 was	 confident	 that	 they	 were	 alone.	 At	 Chaz's request,	 he	 and	 Enrique	 had	 sneaked	 forward,	 leading	 the	 group	 towards	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">medical	unit	exit.	Chaz	had	covered	their	backs,	keeping	Estelle	and	Kelly	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">him.	Dodds	and	Enrique	moved	to	either	side	of	the	door,	signalling	the	all-clear</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	Chaz,	who	hurried	forward	with	the	two	women. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 noticed	 that	 the	 light	 on	 the	 control	 panel	 on	 this	 side	 of	 the	 door was	blinking	on	and	off	and	guessed	that	the	lock	he	had	engaged	earlier	was	no</p>

<p class="calibre1">have	stood	up	to	anything	more	than	a	shoulder	barge	from	their	attacker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That	 whole	 sequence	 was	 still	 quite	 vivid	 in	 his	 mind:	 had	 it	 really</p>
<p class="calibre1">happened?	 Were	 they	 all	 really	 here,	 crawling	 out	 of	 a	 morgue	 where	 they	 had just	cut	open	a	dead	woman	and	fought	a	man	who	had	somehow	come	back	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">life? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See	anything?”	Chaz	asked	Dodds	and	Enrique	in	a	low	tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 rose	 and	 took	 a	 cautious	 peek	 out	 the	 circular	 infirmary	 door</p>
<p class="calibre1">windows.	The	central	hall	appeared	a	great	deal	darker	than	when	they	had	first</p>
<p class="calibre1">arrived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nothing,”	 he	 said,	 choosing	 not	 to	 linger	 by	 the	 window	 any	 longer	 than</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	necessary.	“But	it	looks	like	a	number	of	lights	have	blown.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	the	soldiers	have	shot	them	out,”	Chaz	said	with	a	shake	of	his	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	 do	 that	 so	 that	 it	 makes	 it	 harder	 for	 their	 enemies	 to	 see	 where	 they're going.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	nodded,	quite	willing	to	accept	just	about	anything	the	big	man	told</p>
<p class="calibre1">them.	Questions	could	wait	until	later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take	a	step	outside,	carefully.	Keep	low	and	don't	make	any	noise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“OK,”	 Dodds	 nodded.	 He	 pushed	 at	 the	 door,	 but	 found	 it	 almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">impossible	to	move,	as	if	there	was	a	lot	of	weight	in	front	of	it.	Enrique	came	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p273"></a>his	aid	and	between	them	they	managed	to	open	the	door	just	wide	enough	for Dodds	to	squeeze	through,	the	bulky	propulsion	pack	on	his	back	making	it	more</p>
<p class="calibre1">awkward	than	normal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	he	stepped	out	into	the	darkened	main	hall,	his	boot	slid	on	something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	down	and	saw	he	was	standing	in	a	pool	of	blood.	The	mass	that	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	holding	back	the	door	was	a	rather	large	woman,	who	had	died	as	a	result</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	multiple	plasma	wounds	to	the	torso.	Her	dead	eyes	gazed	straight	ahead	into</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	rest	of	the	main	hall.	The	hall	was	not	as	dark	as	Dodds	had	first	thought	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	 he	 followed	 her	 gaze	 he	 became	 aware	 of	 the	 fate	 of	 the	 refugees.	 What	 he had	first	believed	to	be	the	random	scatterings	of	abandoned	coats	and	luggage, </p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 in	 fact	 dead	 bodies.	 Dozens	 of	 them.	 Men,	 women	 and	 children	 lay	 all</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	the	floor.	If	it	were	not	for	the	terrible	wounds	and	the	blood,	Dodds	might</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	 thought	 that	 they	 had	 all	 fallen	 victim	 to	 some	 mysterious	 plague.	 As	 the hideous	smell	of	burnt	flesh	started	to	fill	his	nostrils,	Dodds	pulled	himself	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">through	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	did	you	see?”	Enrique	asked	in	a	low	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They're	all	dead,”	Dodds	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	refugees.	They've	all	been	killed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	see	any	soldiers?”	Chaz	cut	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	Dodds	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	 forced	 himself	 out	 the	 narrow	 gap	 to	 take	 a	 look	 for	 himself,	 before</p>
<p class="calibre1">returning	back	to	the	corridor	and	confirming	that	the	hall	was	clear	of	danger; </p>
<p class="calibre1">though	 there	 was	 much	 evidence	 of	 the	 slaughter	 that	 had	 taken	 place.	 At	 this point,	Chaz	concluded	that	they	would	simply	have	to	make	a	run	for	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 slipped	 through	 the	 door	 and	 then	 beckoned	 for	 the	 others	 to	 follow, </p>
<p class="calibre1">telling	 them	 to	 stay	 low	 and	 stay	 quiet.	 In	 a	 line,	 headed	 up	 by	 Chaz,	 they walked	 as	 fast	 as	 they	 could	 in	 their	 crouched	 positions,	 keeping	 the	 wall	 of desolate	coffee	shops	and	other	stores	to	their	backs.	The	air	was	heavy	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">stench	of	burnt	materials	and	flesh,	and	all	five	of	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	did	their	best	not to	gag	and	cough	with	every	breath	they	took. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	 looked	 all	 about	 themselves	 as	 they	 moved,	 keeping	 an	 eye	 out	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">any	sudden	appearance	of	the	soldiers	Enrique	had	mentioned.	Glass	and	plastics</p>
<p class="calibre1">crunched	loudly	under	their	feet,	as	though	wishing	to	expose	their	position	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">purpose.	They	did	not	have	all	that	far	to	go	to	return	to	the	airlock,	but	out	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	open	they	would	have	little	hope	of	surprising	their	enemy,	as	they	had	done</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	morgue.	And	this	time,	they	would	be	facing	off	against	more	than	one	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Halfway	to	the	airlock,	the	sound	of	running	feet	came	from	close	by. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p274"></a>“Down!	 Get	 down!”	 Chaz	 hissed,	 waving	 a	 hand	 to	 the	 floor.	 “Keep	 still and	don't	move!”	The	group	dropped	to	the	floor,	lying	on	their	stomachs	among</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	dead,	the	propulsion	packs	on	their	backs	making	it	difficult	to	assume	any</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Dodds	lay	in	wait,	his	eyes	fell	on	two	faces	that	were	within	his	line	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">sight.	One	was	that	of	a	young	woman,	the	other	an	older	man,	somewhere	in	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">late	 thirties	 or	 early	 forties.	 Dark	 patches	 of	 blood	 were	 splattered	 about	 their expressions,	mixed	in	with	the	woman's	blonde	hair	and	the	man's	black.	Their</p>
<p class="calibre1">eyes	were	wide,	their	faces	twisted	in	terror. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 was	 reminded	 of	 a	 scene	 from	 not	 long	 ago.	 He	 found	 himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">thinking	of	Poppy	and	Stefan,	and	a	feeling	of	guilt	rumbled	up	his	spine.  <i class="calibre4">Don't</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">look	at	them</i>,	he	told	himself.	But	he	did	anyway,	and	for	a	time	he	was	unable	to tear	 his	 eyes	 away	 from	 them.	 He	 found	 himself	 wishing	 to	 tell	 them	 he	 was sorry;	 that	 it	 had	 been	 a	 terrible	 accident;	 that	 if	 he	 could	 turn	 back	 time,	 he would	do	things	differently.	He	blotted	the	thoughts	from	his	mind	as	the	sound</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	hurrying	feet	grew	louder;	and	before	long,	the	source	appeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 man	 and	 woman	 came	 running	 down	 a	 non-moving	 escalator	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">first	floor,	where	a	number	of	other	restaurants,	bars	and	sleeping	areas	existed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	man	was	half	dragging,	half	pulling	the	woman	along	behind	him	as	the	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempted	 to	 escape	 their	 pursuers.	 They	 would	 have	 been	 better	 off	 running</p>
<p class="calibre1">without	holding	hands,	but	it	was	clear	that	the	man	wanted	to	keep	the	woman</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	him,	fearing	that	they	might	become	separated.	They	stumbled	a	number	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">times	on	their	way	down	the	static	escalator,	but	managed	to	keep	themselves	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	feet;	even	at	the	great	speed	they	were	descending,	taking	the	steps	two	or</p>
<p class="calibre1">three	at	a	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Loud	voices	followed	and	then	a	pair	of	black	figures	appeared	by	the	first</p>
<p class="calibre1">floor	 railings.	 Two	 of	 the	 soldiers!	 One	 raised	 a	 rifle	 and	 fired	 with	 clinical accuracy,	 two	 blots	 of	 plasma	 striking	 the	 escaping	 woman	 in	 the	 back	 as	 the couple	tried	in	vain	to	flee.	She	screamed	and	tumbled	to	the	floor,	her	partner</p>
<p class="calibre1">losing	his	grip	on	her	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Out	of	the	corners	of	his	eyes,	Dodds	saw	his	fellow	team	mates	tense	as	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">did,	 though	 they	 remained	 motionless	 on	 the	 floor,	 reluctant	 witnesses	 to	 the scene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 their	 pursuers	 bounding	 down	 the	 escalator	 after	 them,	 the	 man</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempted	to	pull	the	woman	to	her	feet.	She	wobbled	as	she	tried	to	stand,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	she	did	so,	she	revealed	that	her	clothing	had	been	burnt	away	around	the	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">spots	on	her	back	where	she	had	been	hit,	hideous	blackened	and	charred	flesh</p>
<p class="calibre1">visible	beneath.	The	man	could	not	help	her	to	stand	quick	enough	and	he	looked</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	to	see	one	of	the	two	soldiers	bearing	down	on	him.	He	was	hit	square	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p275"></a>chest	 by	 two	 rounds	 of	 his	 own	 and	 was	 dead	 even	 before	 he	 hit	 the	 floor,	 the bolts	 carving	 their	 way	 straight	 through	 him.	 Having	 ignored	 the	 woman	 in</p>
<p class="calibre1">preference	to	taking	out	the	man,	the	soldiers	finally	dispatched	her,	seemingly</p>
<p class="calibre1">unmoved	by	her	sobs	and	pleas	for	mercy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	few	moments	later,	there	were	more	hurried	footsteps	and	the	remaining</p>
<p class="calibre1">three	soldiers	that	Enrique	had	described	seeing	came	running	into	the	scene,	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">join	 with	 those	 standing	 over	 their	 latest	 victims.	 They	 began	 to	 converse,	 one pointing	back	the	way	they	had	come,	others	examining	their	weaponry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	studied	them	as	they	spoke	to	one	another,	listening	to	their	words.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	not	a	language	he	had	ever	heard	before	and	a	nagging	feeling	grew	within</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	 that	 it	 wasn't	 normal.	 He	 tried	 to	 convince	 himself	 that	 it	 was	 an	 Imperial dialect	that	he	was	unfamiliar	with,	but	the	characteristics	of	the	tongue	were	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">wrong.	It	sounded	almost	angry	and	mechanical,	even	though	there	was	a	strong</p>
<p class="calibre1">central	Imperial	accent	present	in	each	spoken	word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These	 five	 soldiers	 all	 sported	 a	 number	 of	 different	 armaments,	 like	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	 they	 had	 encountered	 in	 the	 morgue.	 As	 well	 as	 the	 weapon	 each	 held	 in their	 hands,	 they	 also	 had	 a	 rifle	 slung	 over	 their	 backs.	 Some	 also	 had	 an additional	 pistol	 holstered	 to	 their	 right	 legs.	 Again,	 like	 the	 soldier	 they	 had fought	 in	 the	 mortuary,	 they	 all	 appeared	 to	 be	 a	 lot	 taller	 than	 normal	 and	 in excellent	physical	condition.	There	also	appeared	to	be	two	women	in	the	group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	were	more	slender	than	the	three	others,	but	just	as	tall.	Something	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	of	Dodds'	mind	told	him	that	they	were	also	as	strong	and	dangerous	as	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">men.	 Their	 suits	 hugged	 their	 bodies	 well,	 showing	 off	 all	 their	 perfectly-</p>
<p class="calibre1">proportioned	curves.	They,	too,	looked	like	models. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 hoped	 that	 the	 soldiers	 would	 leave	 the	 area	 now	 that	 they	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">eliminated	their	targets;	or,	better	still,	that	once	they	had	finished	speaking,	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	 depart	 the	 starport	 and	 head	 back	 to	 where	 they	 had	 come	 from.	 But	 as they	 spoke,	 one	 of	 the	 soldiers	 gestured	 to	 the	 bodies	 on	 the	 floor	 and	 then pointed	in	the	direction	of	the	medical	unit. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">You're	missing	your	friend! </i>	Dodds	thought.  <i class="calibre4">He	hasn't	checked	back	in! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	troops	began	to	scout	the	area,	nudging	and	kicking	over	bodies	as	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">went.	 For	 a	 moment,	 Dodds	 wondered	 what	 they	 were	 doing.	 Understanding</p>
<p class="calibre1">then	hit	him	like	a	sledgehammer	and	he	had	to	stifle	a	yelp,	forcing	himself	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	panic.	He	fought	the	compulsion	to	turn	to	the	others	and	work	out	a	plan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 it	 was	 kicked,	 one	 of	 the	 corpses	 let	 out	 a	 grunt,	 the	 noise	 telling	 all within	earshot	that	it	was	in	fact	playing	dead.	The	“corpse”	then	rolled	over	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 man	 scrambled	 to	 his	 feet.	 Its	 investigator	 reacted	 quickly	 to	 the	 sudden movement	and	shot	him	down.	The	man	cried	as	a	second	and	third	shot	struck</p>
<p class="calibre1">him,	and	then	fell	down	silent.	The	four	other	soldiers	paused	for	a	moment	in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p276"></a>their	own	hunt,	before	returning	to	their	rounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh	my	god...”	Dodds	heard	Kelly	squeak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 concurred.	 The	 black-suited	 soldiers	 continued	 to	 nudge	 and	 kick	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">fallen,	drawing	a	pistol	every	now	and	again	and	shooting	a	body	to	guarantee	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	 not	 also	 playing	 dead.	 Their	 persistence	 met	 with	 success	 on	 another	 two occasions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	shifted	his	eyes	to	where	Estelle	lay	next	to	him,	seeing	her	almost</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	stiff	as	a	board,	though	shivering	ever	so	slightly.	He	couldn't	be	sure	whether</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	was	due	to	fear	or	the	cool	of	the	station;	though,	from	the	way	he	felt,	he	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">certain	it	was	the	former.	He	then	shifted	his	eyes	over	to	Chaz,	wondering	what</p>
<p class="calibre1">suggestions	the	big	man	was	going	to	make. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	studied	the	dark	troop	as	they	moved	about,	making	a	full	evaluation	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">situation	before	making	his	move.	From	the	looks	of	things,	it	would	not	be	long</p>
<p class="calibre1">before	 they	 made	 their	 way	 over	 towards	 where	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	 were	 concealing themselves.	He	would	have	to	act	soon.	Chaz	re-evaluated	what	he	had	removed</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 the	 downed	 soldier	 in	 the	 morgue:	 to	 their	 name,	 the	 five	 Confederation pilots	had	one	shotgun,	with	only	a	handful	of	shells;	a	near-full	plasma	pistol, </p>
<p class="calibre1">but	 with	 only	 one	 spare	 fuel	 cell;	 and	 three	 smoke	 grenades	 and	 two	 regular ones.	 This	 did	 not	 bode	 well	 for	 them;	 not	 in	 comparison	 with	 the	 enemy's</p>
<p class="calibre1">armament	of	numerous	shotguns,	plasma	rifles,	pistols,	grenades	and	God	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew	 whatever	 else.	 He	 had	 been	 quite	 stunned	 at	 how	 poorly	 equipped	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">invader	 had	 been.	 Either	 he	 had	 been	 acting	 as	 a	 scout,	 or	 he	 had	 exhausted much	of	his	ammunition	before	coming	in	search	of	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	noticed	that	Estelle	had	shifted	her	position	and	was	looking	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Chaz,	come	on!	What	do	we	do? </i>	her	eyes	cried.  <i class="calibre4">We	have	to	get	out	of	here! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">NOW! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">He	made	a	swift	decision. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“When	I	say	move,	get	into	that	bar	over	there	-	The	Lodge.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	almost	jumped	at	the	sound	of	the	big	man's	voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p277"></a>“Find	 decent	 cover,	 away	 from	 the	 entrance.”	 As	 Chaz	 finished	 speaking, one	 of	 the	 soldiers'	 heads	 snapped	 around	 to	 face	 in	 their	 direction,	 a	 pair	 of ruby-red	eyes	falling	upon	the	group. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">He	 could	 </i> not <i class="calibre4">	 have	 heard	 that! </i>	 Dodds	 thought.  <i class="calibre4">He's	 too	 bloody	 far	 away! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The	big	man	had	spoken	just	loud	enough	so	that	Enrique	and	Kelly	would	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	difficulty	in	hearing	the	whole	sentence,	but	not	enough	to	project	his	voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	five	black-suited	soldiers.	To	his	mind,	it	was	not	possible	to	have	heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	over	that	distance.	Even	so,	it	appeared	he	had	been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Enrique,	you	ready?”	Chaz	asked	out	of	the	corner	of	his	mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	tell	me	what	to	do,”	Enrique	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Get	ready	to	shoot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	tall	soldier	had	broken	off	from	his	systematic	sweep	and	was	heading</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	 in	 their	 direction.	 Dodds	 watched	 as	 the	 soldier	 walked	 towards	 them, </p>
<p class="calibre1">holding	 his	 breath	 and	 not	 even	 daring	 to	 blink.	 As	 he	 approached,	 the	 soldier tapped	at	the	side	of	his	helmet,	around	the	same	area	that	Dodds	had	noticed	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">button-like	indent.	He	scanned	over	the	bodies	for	a	moment	and	then	appeared</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 focus	 on	 something.	 He	 was	 looking	 at	 the	 flight	 helmets.	 After	 a	 few</p>
<p class="calibre1">seconds,	he	tapped	his	helmet	again	and	hoisted	his	weapon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“NOW!”	 Chaz	 shouted.	 The	 noise	 caught	 the	 soldier	 off-guard	 and	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">swung	his	weapon	around	toward	Chaz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	the	same	time,	Enrique	brought	himself	up	into	a	prone	position,	raising</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	shotgun	off	the	ground.	It	had	been	a	long	time	since	he	had	used	a	weapon</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	this,	and	that,	coupled	with	the	lack	of	time	to	aim,	did	not	inspire	him	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	confidence.	The	proximity	of	soldier	and	nature	of	the	weapon,	however, </p>
<p class="calibre1">meant	 that	 he	 had	 little	 to	 worry	 about.	 His	 finger	 pulled	 back	 on	 the	 trigger, discharging	the	shotgun	and	sending	pellets	flying	straight	into	his	target's	legs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 soldier	 roared	 in	 agony	 and	 buckled	 down,	 the	 sudden	 and	 intense	 pain</p>
<p class="calibre1">making	him	lose	his	grip	on	his	own	weapon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Move!”	 Chaz	 ordered,	 springing	 to	 his	 feet	 as	 the	 sudden	 noise	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">activity	 focused	 the	 attentions	 of	 the	 other	 soldiers.	 Dodds,	 Estelle	 and	 Kelly snatched	up	their	flight	helmets	and	dived	into	the	bar	as	Chaz	capitalised	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">surprise	attack.	He	fired	the	plasma	pistol	randomly	at	the	other	soldiers,	causing</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	to	scurry	for	cover. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Residing	in	the	middle	of	the	central	hall	was	a	large	oval	desk,	that	at	one</p>
<p class="calibre1">point	in	time	had	served	to	provide	visitors	to	the	port	with	information,	help	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	point	of	contact	for	the	port's	management	and	security.	They	ducked	behind	it, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 solid	 structure	 of	 the	 reception	 providing	 them	 with	 protection	 against	 the Confederation	pilots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	 began	 to	 fall	 back	 to	 the	 bar,	 still	 firing	 on	 the	 four	 soldiers	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p278"></a>preparing	to	move	a	lot	faster	once	they	decided	to	return	fire.	Enrique	was	on his	 feet	 and	 moving	 back	 to	 join	 him.	 In	 front	 of	 them,	 their	 first	 target	 had regained	his	composure	 and	was	bringing	 his	weapon	back	 around	towards	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">two	 men	 once	 more.	 Enrique	 took	 note	 and	 emptied	 another	 round	 into	 him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">knocking	him	down	onto	his	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don't	waste	it!”	Chaz	urged	as	they	retreated	into	the	bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	took	up	positions	close	to	the	front,	using	the	walls	for	cover	against</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	rain	of	return	fire.	Bottles	and	glasses	that	had	not	already	been	broken	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">looted	by	the	refugees	shattered	behind	them,	as	they	were	struck	by	bullets	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">plasma	 bolts.	 Chaz	 chanced	 a	 glance	 around	 the	 pillar	 he	 stood	 behind	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">snatched	back	as	plasma	fire	slammed	into	it,	inches	from	his	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	 the	 plan,	 Chaz?”	 Estelle	 called	 from	 her	 hiding	 spot	 behind	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bar's	counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	 working	 on	 it,”	 Chaz	 said	 through	 gritted	 teeth,	 taking	 a	 hasty	 look</p>
<p class="calibre1">outside	the	bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another	of	the	soldiers	had	hurried	forward	to	aid	his	fallen	comrade	whilst</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 others	 laid	 down	 suppressing	 fire.	 Chaz	 risked	 a	 number	 of	 potshots,	 but	 it did	little	to	disperse	them.	He	saw	the	soldier	take	hold	of	his	ally	by	the	forearm</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 begin	 to	 effortlessly	 pull	 him	 backward,	 bumping	 over	 and	 parting	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bodies	of	the	refugees	that	lay	in	their	way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Enrique,	those	two!”	Chaz	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique	 leaned	 round	 the	 pillar	 wall	 and	 took	 a	 snap	 shot	 at	 the	 two</p>
<p class="calibre1">retreating	men.	He	did	not	find	as	much	success	as	he	had	before,	only	winging</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	rescuer	on	the	shoulder.	The	man	staggered	back,	releasing	his	grip.	Though</p>
<p class="calibre1">only	 a	 few	 seconds	 following	 the	 interruption,	 the	 soldier	 continued	 to	 pull	 his ally	out	of	the	way	with	his	other	arm,	unfazed	by	the	attempt	on	his	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	nearly	out,”	Enrique	announced	as	he	sank	back	down	against	the	wall</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	checked	his	ammunition.	Chaz	tossed	him	over	the	remaining	shells. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“He's	 getting	 up!”	 Dodds	 said.	 From	 his	 own	 hiding	 place,	 Dodds	 had	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">good	view	of	the	scene	within	the	central	hall,	and	watched	in	horror	as	the	man</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 Enrique	 had	 emptied	 two	 shotgun	 rounds	 into	 began	 getting	 to	 his	 feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	had	only	just	convinced	himself	that	the	first	soldier	they	had	downed	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	morgue	had	received	nothing	more	than	flesh	wounds,	the	bullets	Estelle	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">fired	being	slowed	by	the	man's	leather	suit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	reality	of	what	they	were	up	against	had	finally	begun	to	sink	in,	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 cries	 of	 the	 pilot	 that	 Estelle	 had	 shot	 down	 three	 days	 ago	 came	 rushing back	into	his	head.	The	pilot	had	begged	not	to	be	sent	back,	that	if	he	went	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 would	 die.	 Now	 that	 Dodds	 thought	 about	 it,	 the	 man	 had	 spoken	 with	 an Imperial	 accent.	 He	 had	 thought	 nothing	 of	 it	 at	 the	 time,	 but	 now...	 Was	 this</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p279"></a>what	those	three	had	been	running	from?	Had	they	been	so	desperate	to	escape from	 this	 nightmare	 that	 they	 would	 risk	 going	 head-to-head	 with	 seasoned</p>
<p class="calibre1">Confederation	starfighter	pilots?	The	odds	of	their	success	had	been	low,	but	no</p>
<p class="calibre1">doubt	 higher	 than	 their	 odds	 against	 these	 soldiers.	 The	 “rumours”	 he,	 Enrique and	Chaz	had	heard	the	previous	night	no	longer	seemed	to	be	just	that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something	 else	 occurred	 to	 him:	 was	 this	 how	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	had	been	so	easily</p>
<p class="calibre1">overcome?	From	what	he	was	seeing,	even	the	several	thousand	strong	crew	of</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>'s	 full	 complement	 would	 be	 no	 match	 against	 such	 unrelenting	 foes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What	other	secrets	were	the	CSN	keeping	from	them? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 looked	 to	 Chaz,	 who	 was	 sheltering	 from	 the	 bullets	 and	 plasma	 that</p>
<p class="calibre1">continued	 to	 fly	 into	 the	 bar,	 ripping	 plaster	 and	 chunks	 of	 concrete	 from	 the walls;	 splintering	 wooden	 chairs,	 tables	 and	 the	 counter;	 shattering	 bottles, </p>
<p class="calibre1">glasses	and	decorations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	caught	Chaz's	eyes.	The	man	looked	stressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chaz,	seriously,	who	the	hell	are	these	guys?”	Dodds	asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	considerable	pause,	then,	in	a	grim	voice,	“They're	the	result	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Senate's	desire	to	control	the	Empire.	They're	a	mistake.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?”	Dodds	said.	“They're	a	 <i class="calibre4">mistake</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">More	wood	and	plaster	flew.	Enrique	swore,	his	voice	loud	above	the	other</p>
<p class="calibre1">noise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What	do	you	mean?	Are	they	human?”	Dodds	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 was	 staring	 at	 him,	 but	 Chaz	 took	 no	 notice,	 lost	 in	 thought	 as	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">how	they	were	to	escape	from	their	current	predicament.	He	checked	the	counter</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 his	 plasma	 pistol	 and	 saw	 that	 only	 two	 shots	 in	 the	 current	 fuel	 cell remained.	Shooting	down	the	enemy	was	now	not	an	option	-	if	it	had	ever	been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	ducked	out	of	hiding	again,	to	loose	off	the	final	two	shots	before	crouching</p>
<p class="calibre1">down	behind	the	wall	to	reload	the	pistol.	He	tossed	the	empty	fuel	cell	away,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	splash	it	made	as	it	hit	the	floor	grabbing	his	attention	for	the	first	time.	It was	 then	 that	 he	 noticed	 the	 thin	 liquid	 that	 covered	 the	 floor,	 as	 well	 as	 the strong	smell	of	wine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Estelle,	 what	 you	 two	 got	 back	 there?”	 he	 shouted	 to	 the	 two	 women</p>
<p class="calibre1">taking	refuge	behind	the	counter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	don't	have	any	weapons	or	ammo!”	Estelle	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	unless	you	want	to	start	throwing	beer	glasses	at	them!”	Kelly	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anything	with	a	high	percentage	of	alcohol?”	Chaz	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They're	 starting	 to	 come	 around!”	 Enrique	 cried.	 At	 their	 current	 range, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique's	 shotgun	 was	 not	 going	 to	 be	 as	 accurate	 or	 effective	 against	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">soldiers	as	the	pistol.	He	fired	it	nonetheless,	in	an	attempt	to	keep	the	soldiers</p>
<p class="calibre1">together,	though	they	had	already	split	into	two	groups	and	had	begun	to	circle</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p280"></a>around,	to	take	the	bar	blindsided. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	 took	 a	 chance	 and	 fully	 exposed	 himself,	 firing	 off	 several	 shots	 at</p>
<p class="calibre1">both	groups	to	drive	them	back.	The	gamble	paid	off	and	the	soldiers	once	again</p>
<p class="calibre1">pulled	 back	 for	 cover.	 He	 sought	 cover	 once	 more	 himself,	 knowing	 that	 he</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	not	be	able	to	pull	off	such	a	move	again.	He	counted	himself	lucky	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	had	not	been	shot	to	ribbons,	even	for	those	brief	few	seconds.	The	soldiers</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	not	only	very	accurate,	but	also	possessed	incredible	reflexes.	He	assumed</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	must	have	already	used	up	their	more	powerful	armaments	dealing	with	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">refugees;	he	would	not	be	safe	behind	the	wall	otherwise.	It	had	bought	them	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">little	time,	but	even	that	was	already	beginning	to	run	out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Found	anything?”	Chaz	called. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	 and	 Kelly	 were	 ransacking	 the	 lower	 cupboards,	 looking	 for</p>
<p class="calibre1">anything	that	might	be	of	use. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Vodka,”	Kelly	volunteered,	her	eyes	resting	on	some	large	clear	bottles	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">liquid	labelled	 <i class="calibre4">Velda</i>.	“Lots	of	it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bring	it	here	-	and	hurry!”	Chaz	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Estelle	 thrust	 two	 of	 the	 large	 bottles	 into	 Kelly's	 arms	 and	 the	 woman</p>
<p class="calibre1">somewhat	 reluctantly	 crawled	 towards	 Chaz,	 pausing	 under	 wooden	 tables	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	went. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	 many	 are	 there?”	 the	 big	 man	 said,	 as	 she	 pulled	 herself	 up	 next	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About	two	dozen	or	so	under	the	counter,”	she	said.	“Maybe	more	if...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Toss	them	out	there,”	Chaz	said.	“Take	the	caps	off	and	try	and	make	sure</p>
<p class="calibre1">they	 break.	 Make	 sure	 you	 get	 a	 good	 spread.	 Estelle,	 Dodds	 pass	 her	 the	 rest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique	and	I	will	cover	you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 others	 started	 to	 follow	 his	 request,	 without	 question.	 Chaz	 fired	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">pistol	sparingly	as	they	did	so,	keeping	a	close	watch	on	the	ammunition	counter</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	he	and	Enrique	continued	to	lay	down	a	suppressing	fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 the	 bottles	 were	 thrown	 out,	 smashing	 on	 the	 white	 marble	 floor,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">black	 soldiers	 ceased	 firing	 and	 held	 their	 position	 behind	 the	 massive	 desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	seemed	uncertain	of	what	was	going	on	and	why	their	enemy	had	resorted</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	such	a	bizarre	tactic.	Such	feelings	were	shared	by	Dodds,	Estelle	and	Kelly</p>
<p class="calibre1">who	were,	at	this	point,	willing	to	try	anything	to	get	out	of	the	port	alive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only	got	one	shot	left,”	Enrique	said,	at	the	same	time	that	the	bottles	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">vodka	 ran	 out.	 All	 the	 bottles	 had	 shattered	 where	 they	 had	 been	 thrown,	 the alcohol	spreading	out	across	the	floor	and	soaking	into	the	clothes	of	the	dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pass	it	over	here,”	Chaz	said,	still	not	willing	to	explain	or	discuss	his	train</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	thought	with	the	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enrique	ducked	down	and	slid	the	weapon	across	the	floor	to	the	big	man, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p281"></a>who	let	it	come	to	rest	next	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When	 I	 give	 you	 the	 signal,	 I	 want	 you	 all	 to	 get	 out	 of	 here	 and	 head towards	the	airlock.	Don't	wait	for	me;	I'll	be	right	behind	you.”	He	produced	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">three	smoke	grenades,	double-checking	that	they	were	what	he	was	after.	“Hold</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	breath.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking	hold	of	the	first,	he	pulled	the	pin	and	let	it	roll	away	from	him.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">canister	immediately	began	to	billow	thick	green	smoke,	filling	the	inside	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bar.	Setting	off	another,	he	tossed	it	just	outside	the	entrance	to	the	bar,	yellow</p>
<p class="calibre1">smoke	 belching	 forth	 and	 beginning	 to	 cover	 the	 surrounding	 area.	 He	 then</p>
<p class="calibre1">threw	 the	 third	 in	 the	 direction	 they	 would	 need	 to	 take	 to	 reach	 the	 airlock, purple	smoke	spewing	out	of	the	canister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go!	Now!”	Chaz	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 watched	 as	 his	 four	 allies	 made	 their	 way	 past	 him,	 the	 air	 all	 around them	 filling	 with	 multicoloured	 gas.	 The	 combination	 of	 the	 three	 grenades	 in the	 small	 area	 was	 already	 providing	 an	 effective	 screen	 for	 their	 escape,	 but Chaz	 knew	 this	 was	 not	 enough.	 Dropping	 the	 plasma	 pistol	 into	 his	 flight</p>
<p class="calibre1">helmet,	 he	 tossed	 the	 shotgun	 outside	 the	 bar,	 where	 he	 could	 more	 easily</p>
<p class="calibre1">retrieve	it	following	the	final	phase	of	his	plan. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">As	the	smoke	screen	covered	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights, </i>	the	soldiers	tapped	at	the	side	of	their helmets,	 changing	 the	 internal	 visor	 settings;	 a	 tactic	 they	 had	 used	 whilst hunting	down	escaping	refugees	in	the	near-darkness	that	the	soldiers	themselves</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	perpetuated.	They	had	since	returned	their	visors	to	normal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	with	the	thick	blanket	of	smoke	now	obscuring	their	vision,	they	chose</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	setting	that	allowed	them	to	see	thermal	radiation.	The	smoke	screen	that	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	 providing	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	 with	 cover	 for	 their	 escape	 was	 undone,	 and	 their forms	were	revealed	as	silhouettes	of	red,	yellow	and	blue-green	hues,	running</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	best	they	could	from	the	bar	in	the	direction	of	the	airlock	corridor,	skipping</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	bodies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All	that	was,	except	for	one,	who	remained	outside	the	entrance	of	the	shot</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	 bar.	 The	 silhouette	 did	 not	 stay	 in	 that	 position	 for	 very	 long,	 however, making	a	sudden	throwing	motion	and	then	beginning	to	run	itself,	grabbing	two</p>
<p class="calibre1">objects	off	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Training	 their	 guns	 on	 the	 figure,	 the	 soldiers	 prepared	 to	 open	 fire	 when</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 vision	 exploded,	 overwhelmed	 with	 an	 intensity	 of	 reds,	 oranges	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p282"></a>yellows.	 The	 definition	 of	 their	 surroundings	 was	 lost.	 They	 did	 not	 need	 to switch	 off	 their	 thermal	 vision	 to	 realise	 that	 a	 fierce	 blaze	 had	 sprung	 up between	them	and	their	quarry.	It	was	now	spreading	fast,	the	fire	setting	alight</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 clothes	 and	 other	 flammable	 items	 that	 had	 at	 one	 time	 belonged	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">refugees. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">The	combination	of	thick,	multicoloured	smoke	and	flames	provided	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">with	adequate	cover	and	the	group	reached	the	airlock	unscathed.	Reaching	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">door	first,	Dodds	started	to	work	the	control	panel,	opening	it	and	allowing	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">others	through.	He	remained	in	front	of	the	panel	as	the	others	made	their	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	the	chamber,	lest	it	close	and	leave	some	of	them	on	the	wrong	side	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">thick	 doors.	 He	 saw	 Chaz	 bringing	 up	 the	 rear	 and	 waved	 him	 through.	 With</p>
<p class="calibre1">him,	the	big	man	carried	the	shotgun	that	he	had	originally	entrusted	to	Enrique, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	well	as	his	flight	helmet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dodds,	get	in	here!”	Estelle	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	released	his	finger	from	the	button	and	started	forward,	only	to	feel</p>
<p class="calibre1">something	latched	onto	his	leg.	He	looked	down	to	see	that	one	of	the	soldier's</p>
<p class="calibre1">previous	victims	was	not	yet	dead	and	was	now	clinging	on	to	him	for	dear	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey!	 Let	 go!”	 he	 started,	 trying	 to	 shake	 the	 man	 off	 him.	 Despite	 his</p>
<p class="calibre1">efforts,	 the	 refugee	 held	 on	 tight,	 refusing	 to	 do	 as	 he	 said,	 the	 desperation	 to escape	and	reach	safety	all	but	closing	his	ears	to	any	such	protest.	Dodds	began</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	swear	profusely,	and	reached	down	in	an	attempt	to	pry	the	man	from	him.	He</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	feel	that	he	would	topple	over	at	any	moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pandoran!	 Pandoran...”	 the	 man	 said,	 looking	 back	 around	 him	 in	 fear, </p>
<p class="calibre1">hearing,	as	Dodds,	the	sound	of	the	soldiers'	heavy	boots	on	the	floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Help!”	Dodds	said,	looking	around	to	his	allies	in	the	chamber,	who	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">affixing	 their	 helmets	 and	 checking	 their	 gear.	 The	 refugee	 was	 attempting	 to pull	himself	up,	repeating	the	same	word	over	and	over.	It	sounded	more	like	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chaz	 came	 rushing	 back	 out	 the	 airlock	 chamber,	 coming	 up	 beside	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">grappling	 pair.	 The	 big	 man	 struck	 the	 refugee	 with	 the	 butt	 of	 the	 shotgun, making	 him	 release	 his	 grip,	 before	 grabbing	 Dodds	 by	 the	 upper	 arm	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">hauling	him	in	to	join	the	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Close	 the	 damn	 door!”	 Chaz	 barked,	 as	 the	 five	 black-clad	 soldiers</p>
<p class="calibre1">rounded	the	corner	at	the	end	of	the	corridor	and	hammered	towards	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p283"></a>As	 the	 airlock	 doors	 began	 to	 close,	 Chaz	 raised	 the	 shotgun	 for	 one	 last time	and	discharged	it.	The	soldiers	did	not	even	halt	as	the	gun	was	fired,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">frontmost	pursuer	being	winged	by	the	spread	of	pellets.	She	fell	backwards,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 others	 simply	 stepped	 over	 her,	 forming	 a	 defensive	 line	 between	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">adversaries	and	their	fallen	team	mate.	Through	the	diminishing	gap,	Chaz	threw</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	shotgun	back	into	the	corridor,	just	as	the	doors	bolted	before	him.	Picking</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	his	flight	helmet	from	the	floor,	he	extracted	the	pistol	he	had	stowed	within</p>
<p class="calibre1">it.	 The	 big	 man	 then	 proceeded	 to	 don	 his	 helmet,	 though	 he	 did	 not	 turn	 his back	on	the	scene	on	the	other	side	of	the	door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	did	likewise,	powerless	to	do	anything	but	stand	and	watch	the	fate</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	the	refugee	that	had	tried	to	come	with	him.	With	few	options	open	to	him,	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">refugee	made	a	vain	attempt	at	rushing	the	soldiers.	The	lead	did	not	bother	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">respond	to	the	threat	with	his	held	weapon,	but	instead	grabbed	the	man	around</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	top	of	his	head	with	one	massive	hand.	Drawing	a	knife	from	his	belt,	he	cut</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	attacker's	throat	in	one	fluid	and	powerful	movement,	before	letting	him	slip</p>
<p class="calibre1">choking	 and	 gasping	 to	 the	 floor.	 The	 remaining	 soldiers	 ran	 up	 to	 the	 closed door	and	stood	in	front	of	it,	the	foremost	raising	the	plasma	rifle	they	held	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">training	it	on	Chaz	through	the	airlock	door	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 watched	 in	 wrapped	 silence.	 Even	 though	 the	 soldier	 could	 have</p>
<p class="calibre1">killed	Chaz	with	a	couple	of	shots,	he	was	not	about	to	pull	the	trigger	and	break</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 glass.	 To	 do	 so	 would	 risk	 exposing	 the	 entire	 port	 to	 the	 vacuum	 of	 space the	 moment	 the	 outer	 airlock	 door	 opened.	 But	 the	 soldier	 waited	 still.	 If	 the outer	door	did	not	open,	for	any	reason,	whether	because	of	a	mechanical	failure</p>
<p class="calibre1">or	 security	 violation,	 then	 Dodds	 was	 certain	 he	 would	 not	 hesitate	 to	 pull	 the trigger.	Even	so,	Chaz	remained	where	he	was,	acknowledging	no-one	else,	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	to	his	fellow	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 warning	 alarm	 started	 in	 the	 chamber,	 signalling	 both	 the	 impending</p>
<p class="calibre1">depressurization	and	Chaz's	victory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here	 we	 go,”	 Enrique	 announced	 to	 the	 sound	 of	 the	 outer	 door	 locks' </p>
<p class="calibre1">release.	Dodds	felt	himself	start	to	drift	out	and	he	made	sure	he	had	a	good	grip</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	the	control	of	his	propulsion	pack.	He	noticed	how	Chaz	continued	to	stare	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 soldiers	 on	 the	 other	 side	 of	 the	 glass,	 even	 as	 he	 floated	 out	 beyond	 the chamber.	Dodds	slowed	himself,	catching	sight	of	the	big	man's	expression	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">noting	it	to	be	one	of	pure	hatred	for	the	invaders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	looked	back	to	the	corridor	and	saw	the	soldier	who	had	been	marking</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 door	 snap	 their	 gun	 back	 and	 turn	 back	 down	 the	 corridor	 with	 his	 team mates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They're	coming	after	us,”	Chaz's	voice	came	in	his	earpiece.	“They're	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">going	to	give	up	that	easily.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p284"></a>“Oh,	hell!	The	freighter's	gone!”	Kelly	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 looked	 all	 around	 himself,	 seeking	 to	 disprove	 her.	 Unfortunately, </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	was	right.	The	only	visible	vessel	was	one	bearing	the	Imperial	coat	of	arms, </p>
<p class="calibre1">docked	onto	the	side	of	the	port;	likely	being	how	the	soldiers	had	entered.	They</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 all	 been	 relying	 on	 the	 freighter's	 presence	 to	 help	 them	 get	 back	 into	 the cloaked	ATAFs.	But	with	their	point	of	reference	gone,	finding	the	invisible	craft</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	seemed	like	an	impossible	task. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 tried	 to	 think.	 He	 looked	 back	 to	 the	 starport	 and	 tried	 to	 trace	 a	 line from	the	airlock	to	where	the	freighter	might	have	been.	But	for	all	his	effort,	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">couldn't	judge	the	distance	or	the	heading;	it	was	too	hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chaz,	what	are	you	doing?”	he	heard	Estelle	ask.	He	saw	the	big	man	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">aiming	 the	 plasma	 pistol,	 a	 small	 green	 bolt	 already	 streaking	 away	 from	 him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	was	no	answer	from	Chaz,	who	seemed	to	be	concentrating	at	the	task	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 fired	 several	 more	 shots,	 in	 seemly	 random	 locations.	 The	 three	 shots</p>
<p class="calibre1">sailed	unhindered	out	into	space.	The	man	adjusted	his	aim	to	target	a	different</p>
<p class="calibre1">region,	 but,	 as	 before,	 the	 next	 two	 bolts	 also	 failed	 to	 land	 a	 target.	 The	 next shot	 he	 fired	 also	 disappeared	 into	 the	 depths,	 then,	 with	 his	 next	 attempt,	 his plan	revealed	itself	to	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 plasma	 bolt	 found	 its	 mark	 and,	 just	 as	 Parks	 had	 warned,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">unmistakeable	form	of	an	ATAF	lit	up	before	their	eyes,	the	shielding	reacting	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 hit	 and	 looking	 as	 if	 someone	 had	 thrown	 luminous	 green	 paint	 all	 over	 it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There	it	remained	but	for	a	scant	few	seconds	before	it	began	to	fade	from	view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There!”	 Chaz	 said,	 drawing	 everyone's	 attention	 to	 the	 withering	 green</p>
<p class="calibre1">ripples	outlining	the	fighter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stay	 here,”	 Estelle	 ordered	 the	 others	 and	 sped	 over	 to	 the	 fighter	 before starting	 to	 ease	 herself	 through	 the	 shielding.	 Despite	 the	 need	 to	 re-enter	 the fighter	as	quick	as	she	could	to	assist	the	others,	she	had	to	take	her	time	pushing</p>
<p class="calibre1">herself	 through	 the	 layers	 of	 tough	 protection;	 a	 task	 that	 could	 not	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">accomplished	without	patience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before	long,	she	disappeared	from	view.	A	short	while	later,	the	fighter	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">entered	was	lit	with	waves	of	cyan	ripples,	blue	bolts	streaking	out	from	the	nose</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 craft.	 They	 hurtled	 forward,	 striking	 objects	 not	 far	 away,	 revealing themselves	to	be	the	four	other	ATAFs.	Estelle	was	using	the	mag	cannons;	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">wasn't	about	to	dare	using	the	main	guns	–	they	could	do	more	harm	than	good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	sped	over	to	the	nearest	visible	craft	to	him	and,	just	as	Estelle	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">done,	 started	 pushing	 himself	 through	 the	 starfighters'	 shielding,	 all	 the	 while glancing	uneasily	back	at	the	Imperial	lander	that	was	still	latched	onto	the	side</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 port.	 At	 any	 moment,	 it	 could	 detach	 itself	 and	 start	 after	 them.	 He	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p285"></a>surprised	it	was	taking	them	this	long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	guessed	that	the	soldiers... </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">What	was	it	that	man	had	called	them?	Pandora..?	Pandoran? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">...	 had	 encountered	 refugees	 that	 had	 escaped	 their	 attention	 before	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">wanted	to	finish	the	job	before	giving	chase,	even	if	the	airlock	escapees	were	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	greater	threat.	He	was	soon	settled	back	into	the	seat	of	the	ATAF	and	began</p>
<p class="calibre1">stabbing	 at	 the	 buttons	 and	 controls	 in	 front	 of	 him,	 bringing	 the	 systems	 back on-line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everyone	ready?”	Estelle	said.	There	was	a	resounding	confirmation	from</p>
<p class="calibre1">all	 and,	 as	 one,	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	 turned	 their	 still	 veiled	 ATAFs	 around	 and	 moved away	from	the	starport,	and	back	towards	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An	explosion	reflected	off	Dodds'	canopy	and	he	looked	around	to	see	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">transport	 craft	 that	 had	 been	 attached	 to	 the	 port	 had	 been	 destroyed.	 The	 port began	to	vent	air,	bodies,	and	other	materials	as	it	depressurized.	A	black	body</p>
<p class="calibre1">spun	out	of	the	hole	that	had	been	ripped	in	the	side	of	the	port,	in	wake	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">transporter's	 destruction.	 The	 figure	 made	 futile	 attempts	 to	 stop	 itself	 from drifting	further	into	space,	but	was	unable	to	do	anything	about	their	slide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 caught	 the	 green	 outline	 of	 an	 ATAF	 just	 as	 it	 faded	 from	 view, </p>
<p class="calibre1">swinging	around	to	rejoin	the	group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	making	sure,”	Chaz	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	they	hurtled	away	from	the	port,	Dodds	looked	back	around	to	see	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 black-suited	 body	 of	 the	 soldier	 was	 still	 moving,	 a	 lot	 longer	 than	 should have	been	possible.	In	his	mind's	eye,	frightening	images	were	painted:</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Though	 the	 ATAF	 was	 invisible,	 the	 soldier	 began	 to	 swim	 through	 space</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">towards	him,	gaining	on	him	despite	the	incredible	speed	of	his	starfighter.	After</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">all,	 what	 was	 the	 lack	 of	 oxygen	 and	 warmth	 to	 one	 who	 had	 survived	 injuries</i> <i class="calibre4">that	 would	 have	 killed	 an	 ordinary	 human	 being?	 Latching	 onto	 the	 ATAF's</i> <i class="calibre4">canopy,	it	punched	straight	through	to	him,	the	shields	and	the	canopy	itself	no</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">match	 for	 its	 incredible	 strength.	 The	 soldier	 grabbed	 him	 by	 his	 flight	 suit,</i> <i class="calibre4">wrenching	 him	 from	 his	 seat	 and	 out	 into	 space,	 the	 buckles	 doing	 nothing	 to</i> <i class="calibre4">save	 him.	 Drawing	 again	 on	 its	 unimaginable	 strength,	 the	 soldier	 punched</i> <i class="calibre4">easier	through	his	flight	helmet,	shattering	the	tough	visor	and	draining	away	all</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">his	 oxygen.	 There	 it	 held	 him	 in	 an	 unbreakable	 grasp,	 waiting	 for	 him	 to	 die;</i> <i class="calibre4">until	 finally	 releasing	 him	 and	 leaving	 his	 lifeless	 body	 to	 float	 through	 space</i> <i class="calibre4">forever,	his	friends	able	to	do	nothing	more	than	look	on	in	horror. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p286"></a>The	 soldier's	 limbs	 did	 eventually	 cease	 their	 flailing,	 but	 by	 then	 Dodds was	not	surprised	by	what	he	had	seen.	It	would	not	have	been	a	shock	to	him	if</p>
<p class="calibre1">it	had	made	an	attempt	to	chase	them,	cloaked	or	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">“He	 would	 make	 an	 excellent	 politician,”	 Estelle	 said	 to	 Dodds.	 She	 had	 spent some	 of	 the	 journey	 back	 to	 the	 carrier	 questioning	 Chaz	 and	 attempting	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">ascertain	 an	 explanation	 for	 his	 behaviour	 at	 the	 starport.	 As	 expected,	 he	 was not	very	forthcoming	with	answers	and	Estelle	had	soon	given	up.	She	would	get</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	explanation	she	was	after	once	she	had	submitted	a	report.	No	doubt	senior</p>
<p class="calibre1">command	would	be	very	interested	in	Chaz's	actions	themselves	and	in	the	end</p>
<p class="calibre1">she	would	get	closure;	even	if	it	took	several	months. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Managed	 to	 answer	 the	 question	 without	 actually	 answering	 it?”	 Dodds</p>
<p class="calibre1">said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Precisely.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	just	grateful	to	get	out	of	there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 too	 had	 many	 questions	 of	 his	 own,	 none	 that	 he	 knew	 would	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">answered	 any	 time	 soon.	 Most	 worrisome	 of	 all,	 Chaz's	 statement:	  <i class="calibre4">They're	 a</i> <i class="calibre4">mistake. </i>	If	that	was	a	mistake,	he	didn't	want	to	think	what	the	original	intention was	supposed	to	be.	The	past	few	hours	had	been	unlike	any	he	had	experienced</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	his	entire	life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 journey	 continued	 in	 relative	 silence,	 the	 five	 pilots	 happy	 to	 take	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">breather	 from	 their	 recent	 experiences.	 Heading	 back	 to	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin, </i>	 Dodds	 felt	 as though	 he	 was	 waking	 from	 a	 terrible	 nightmare;	 albeit	 one	 with	 many</p>
<p class="calibre1">memorable	cuts	and	bruises. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Parks	looked	up	from	his	musings,	to	see	Liu	swing	around	in	his	chair,	wearing</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	relieved	expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Scanners	are	indicating	that	 <i class="calibre4">CSN	Ifrit</i>	has	just	jumped	into	the	system	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">has	started	making	its	way	toward	our	position.	Based	on	their	current	velocity, </p>
<p class="calibre1">they'll	be	with	us	in	a	little	under	thirty	minutes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	joined	the	helmsman	by	his	console.	Sure	enough,	the	medium-range</p>
<p class="calibre1">radar	was	showing	a	green	triangle	moving	towards	the	centre	of	the	display. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	 God,”	 Parks	 said.	 He	 felt	 some	 of	 the	 pressure	 that	 had	 been</p>
<p class="calibre1">weighing	 down	 upon	 him	 starting	 to	 lift.	 In	 the	 hours	 following	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>' </p>
<p class="calibre1">departure,	 Parks	 had	 overseen	 the	 crews'	 efforts	 to	 bring	 the	 ship	 back	 up	 to	 a manageable,	working	condition.	It	had	not	been	easy,	but	with	a	lot	of	effort	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 managed	 to	 restore	 shields,	 engines,	 jump	 drives,	 and	 some	 weapons</p>
<p class="calibre1">systems.	 And	 whilst	 they	 would	 not	 be	 able	 to	 fend	 off	 any	 major	 attacks	 or launch	fighters,	they	were	at	least	in	a	position	to	return	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	 the	 advent	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>'s	 arrival,	 all	 that	 now	 remained	 was	 to	 await	 the <i class="calibre4">Knights' </i>	return	and	they	could	at	last	leave	Phylent	and	begin	the	journey	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 may	 not	 have	 managed	 to	 secure	 the	 recapture	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>,	 but	 he	 would have	 prevented	 valuable	 information	 from	 falling	 into	 the	 hands	 of	 the	 Enemy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That,	at	least,	was	something	to	be	thankful	for. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	turned	to	Weathers,	who	had	taken	the	place	of	O'Donnell	on	the	bridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	are	the	comms	systems?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	should	all	be	functioning	correctly,	sir,”	Weathers	said.	“We	are	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">experiencing	 limited	 performance	 with	 shielding,	 weaponry	 and	 engines,	 but</p>
<p class="calibre1">communications	are	operating	perfectly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good.	Once	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	is	close	enough,	send	them	a	welcome	message	on	short-</p>
<p class="calibre1">range	broadcast	only.	Relay	our	current	situation	to	them	and	let	them	know	we</p>
<p class="calibre1">are	ready	to	leave	as	soon	as	the	 <i class="calibre4">White	Knights</i>	return.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p288"></a>“Yes,	sir,”	Weathers	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	returned	to	his	seat	to	await	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>'s	arrival.	Their	fellow	Confederation carrier	 was	 travelling	 towards	 them	 head-on	 and,	 from	 his	 seat,	 out	 the	 main viewport,	he	was	able	to	see	various	aspects	of	the	ship	springing	into	detail	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">closer	it	grew	to	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 as	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	 bore	 down	 on	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	 location,	 Parks	 started	 to	 grow	 uneasy and	could	not	shake	the	feeling	that	something	was	wrong.	The	carrier	was	well</p>
<p class="calibre1">within	 visual	 range,	 now	 less	 than	 about	 twenty	 kilometres	 out,	 and	 devouring the	distance	at	a	rapid	pace.	From	the	looks	of	things,	it	would	be	on	top	of	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">much	 sooner	 than	 Liu	 had	 at	 one	 time	 predicted.	 He	 subconsciously	 sat	 a	 little more	upright	and	further	forward	in	his	seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	looked	to	Weathers,	“Karen,	has	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	acknowledged	our	HELO?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not	yet,	sir.	Should	I	send	it	again?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,”	 Parks	 shook	 his	 head.	 “First,	 recheck	 the	 comms	 systems.	 Mr	 Liu, </p>
<p class="calibre1">perform	a	full	system	diagnostic.	Let's	be	sure	that	our	message	was	transmitted</p>
<p class="calibre1">in	the	first	place	before	we	begin	bombarding	them	with	repeat	broadcasts.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	 sir,”	 Liu	 said,	 then	 a	 minute	 later,	 “All	 tests	 have	 completed</p>
<p class="calibre1">successfully.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Comms	 are	 still	 functioning	 correctly,	 Captain,”	 Weathers	 added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Though,	it	might	have	been	a	glitch	in	the	system.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	wasn't	so	sure.	Something	wasn't	right.	“Send	the	greeting	again,”	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weathers	complied,	but	there	was	still	no	answer.  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>'s	form	continued	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">grow	larger	as	it	closed	the	distance	between	the	two	carriers,	showing	no	signs</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	slowing.	It	was	barely	a	few	hundred	meters	from	them	now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Parks	rose	from	his	seat	and	walked	to	the	front	of	the	bridge,	he	heard</p>
<p class="calibre1">consoles	 up	 and	 down	 the	 deck	 begin	 to	 whine,	 and	 knew	 right	 then	 that	 his worries	 had	 been	 confirmed.	 He	 looked	 to	 Liu	 at	 the	 same	 moment	 the	 man</p>
<p class="calibre1">turned	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain,  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	 is	 readying	 weapons!”	 Liu	 said,	 the	 former	 look	 of	 relief wiped	clean	and	replaced	by	a	picture	of	panic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Red	alert!”	Parks	said.	“Full	power	to	shields	now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	words	hadn't	even	left	his	mouth	when	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>'s	guns	opened	up,	the	full</p>
<p class="calibre1">barrage	directed	straight	towards	its	almost	defenceless	former	partner	in	battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bright	green	light	from	bolts	of	plasma	intermixed	with	thick	red	beams	of	laser</p>
<p class="calibre1">fire,	the	tiny	blue	and	cyan	particle	trails	of	missiles	almost	lost	in	between. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 opening	 volley	 hit	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	 shields	 hard	 and	 the	 already	 damaged power	 generators	 were	 quick	 to	 buckle	 to	 the	 intensity	 of	 the	 onslaught.	 Parks found	 his	 seat	 just	 as	 an	 enormous	 spray	 of	 bright	 blue	 splinters	 erupted	 from</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p289"></a> <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	bow,	signalling	both	the	collapse	of	the	shielding	and	the	vulnerability of	the	vessel	to	the	hail	of	fire	that	followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Return	fire!”	Parks	barked.  <i class="calibre4">For	what	it's	worth. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	 own	 cannons	 trained	 themselves	 on	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>,	 but	 their	 efforts	 were futile	at	best,	the	carrier	never	having	made	a	full	recovery	from	the	battle	hours</p>
<p class="calibre1">earlier.	The	rate	of	return	fire	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	was	able	to	muster	was	nothing	compared to	that	which	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	continued	to	pour	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Explosions	 scorched	 the	 bow	 and	 topside	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,	 the	 impacts	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">concentrated	plasma	fire	ripping	holes	in	the	already	vulnerable	hull.	All	about</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	ship,	crew	were	thrown	to	the	floor	as	the	carrier	jerked	with	the	unrelenting</p>
<p class="calibre1">attack,	 Parks	 himself	 only	 just	 managing	 to	 remain	 in	 his	 seat.	 The	 captain witnessed	 one	 of	 the	 two	 plasma	 accelerators	 affixed	 to	 the	 front	 of	 the	 carrier explode,	the	turret	snapping	apart	and	the	mount	breaking	free	and	spinning	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	 space.	 Green	 and	 blue	 chemicals	 vented	 from	 the	 shaft.	 Missiles	 exploded all	 across	 the	 hull.	 Debris	 tumbled	 about	 from	 where	 the	 attacks	 had	 shredded the	more	exposed	and	less	well	protected	parts	of	the	vessel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If	 Parks	 had	 considered	 his	 ship	 a	 mess	 before,	 then	 it	 was	 nothing</p>
<p class="calibre1">compared	 to	 what	 he	 was	 looking	 at	 now:	 the	 emblem	 of	 the	 griffin	 residing across	 the	 topside	 of	 the	 carrier,	 stretching	 out	 away	 from	 the	 bridge,	 was scarcely	recognisable,	now	blackened	and	charred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	braced	himself.	He	wondered	how	it	might	all	end.	Would	he	see	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">frontal	viewport	shatter	and	be	pulled	from	his	chair,	out	into	space?	Would	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">feel	 himself	 engulfed	 in	 flames	 for	 a	 few	 moments	 as	 the	 bridge	 exploded?	 Or would	 he	 hear	 only	 a	 sudden	 loud	 bang,	 see	 his	 world	 go	 black,	 and	 then	 no more?	Whatever	it	was,	he	was	sure	he	would	find	out	soon... </p>
<p class="calibre1">And	then,	for	the	second	time	that	day,  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	lights	shut	off,	plunging	the ship	 into	 near-darkness.	 Computer	 arrays	 and	 consoles	 followed	 in	 their	 stead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some	exploded,	adding	to	the	causalities	that	had	already	built	up	during	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>'s barrage,	 smoke	 once	 again	 threatening	 to	 fill	 the	 bridge	 and	 suffocate	 its</p>
<p class="calibre1">occupants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Half-light	spilled	into	the	bridge	from	the	emergency	systems,	relieving	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">crew	 of	 the	 momentary	 darkness.	 It	 was	 aided	 by	 the	 small	 electrical	 fires	 that had	 sprung	 up	 from	 some	 of	 the	 consoles,	 creating	 a	 smoky	 orange	 ambience</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	the	bridge;	 pockets	of	flicking	 blue	light	from	 sparking	electrics	dancing</p>
<p class="calibre1">across	consoles.	Crew	members	darted	about	to	find	firefighting	equipment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	their	power	cut,  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	weapons	fell	silent	and	Parks	braced	himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">for	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>'s	 impending	 finishing	 blow.	 It	 was	 then	 that	 he	 noticed	 that	 the	 carrier had	stopped	rocking	and	that	missiles	and	cannon	fire	no	longer	rained	down	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	ship. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p290"></a>“Mr	Liu...”	Parks	started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They...	 they've	 stopped	 firing,”	 Liu	 said,	 staring	 out	 at	 the	 Confederation</p>
<p class="calibre1">carrier	 that	 had	 moments	 before	 threatened	 to	 bring	 to	 an	 end	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	 long service. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Why? </i>	Parks	wondered.	When	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	had	ignored	their	greetings	but	continued forward,	 he	 knew	 something	 was	 amiss.	 Though	 he	 had	 been	 grateful	 for	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">carrier's	 arrival,	 going	 by	 the	 information	 that	 Turner	 had	 relayed	 to	 him	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i> was	many	hours	late.	By	now,	he	would	be	expecting	to	see	 <i class="calibre4">Leviathan</i>,	instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Dammit,	Aiden,	where	are	you?! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	our	status?”	he	asked	Liu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Power	outage	is	temporary	and	is	only	affecting	certain	systems,	Captain,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liu	said,	working	at	his	console.	“It	can	be	restored	in	a	few	minutes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 hesitated	 for	 a	 moment	 before	 responding	 to	 the	 news.	 “Don't	 bring</p>
<p class="calibre1">us	 back	 on-line,	 Lieutenant,”	 he	 said.	 Something	 told	 him	 that	 it	 would	 not	 be wise	for	them	to	stop	playing	dead	just	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Weathers'	console	started	to	jingle	in	front	of	her.	“Sir,  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	is	attempting	to establish	communications,”	she	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">So,	now	they	want	to	talk</i>,	Parks	thought.	“Put	them	on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	holographic	screen	sprang	up	at	the	front	of	the	bridge,	the	quality	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 picture	 and	 sound	 comparable	 to	 how	 it	 had	 been	 just	 after	 the	 Imperial fighter	 had	 crashed	 onto	 the	 flight	 deck.	 Parks	 heard	 a	 number	 of	 intakes	 of breath	as	he	stood	up	and	walked	closer	to	the	projection	of	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>'s	bridge.	Whilst the	image	was	blocky,	jerky	and	suffering	from	crackling	audio,	it	lost	none	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	impact	it	otherwise	stood	to	deliver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zackaria	 sat	 in	 the	 captain's	 chair	 like	 a	 king	 upon	 his	 throne,	 his	 face</p>
<p class="calibre1">serious	 and	 stern.	 Just	 ahead	 of	 him,	 on	 his	 right-hand	 side,	 stood	 Hawke,	 his expression	deadpan	in	the	face	of	his	former	ally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anthony...”	Parks	began,	the	genuine	shock	in	his	voice	clear	even	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>'s	 attack,	 Parks	 had	 thought	 of	 only	 two	 people	 who	 could	 be commanding	the	carrier:	Admiral	Zackaria	or	Commodore	Rissard.	The	thought</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 Hawke	 alive	 and	 well	 and	 unharmed	 aboard	 the	 ship	 had	 never	 occurred	 to him.	 And	 now,	 the	 sight	 of	 both	 Zackaria	 and	 Hawke	 stood	 side	 by	 side,	 as allies,	almost	floored	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This	 is	 where	 we	 part	 ways,	 Elliott,”	 came	 the	 scratchy	 voice	 of	 Hawke</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 the	 holographic	 image.	 “I	 just	 wanted	 to	 take	 this	 opportunity	 to	 bid	 you farewell.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">His	face	had	changed	a	lot	since	Parks	had	seen	him,	hours	before:	his	skin</p>
<p class="calibre1">looked	fresh	and	healthy,	his	eyes	were	bright,	and	his	facial	hair	was	completely</p>
<p class="calibre1">absent,	as	if	he	had	just	had	a	clean	shave. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p291"></a>“My	God,	man!	What	are	you	doing?”	Parks	said,	flabbergasted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My	 part	 to	 ensure	 the	 continued	 success	 of	 the	 Mission,	 Commodore,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawke	said	with	a	clean	expression.	The	man	spoke	in	a	matter-of-fact	manner, </p>
<p class="calibre1">as	if	there	was	nothing	unusual	or	surprising	about	his	nature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 <i class="calibre4">Mission</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawke	nodded.	Or,	at	least,	what	appeared	to	be	a	nod.	“The	Mission	-	For</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	honour	of	the	Senate.	For	the	glory	of	the	Empire.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	Parks	continued	to	stare	open-mouthed	at	the	image	that	jumped,	froze</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	tore,	the	pieces	of	a	great	puzzle	began	to	fall	into	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 gave	 them	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>,	 didn't	 you?”	 Parks	 said.	 “That's	 why	 you</p>
<p class="calibre1">survived.	 You	 tried	 to	 bargain	 and	 they	 took	 it.	 They	 wanted	 a	 man	 on	 the inside.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Links	 formed	 in	 Parks'	 mind,	 everything	 finally	 starting	 to	 make	 perfect</p>
<p class="calibre1">sense:	the	Enemy	had	intercepted	and	boarded	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	-	how	was	not	important</p>
<p class="calibre1">-	but	he	hazarded	that	at	that	time	it	was	not	with	Hawke's	consent.	Though	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	fought	hard	to	hold	back	the	invaders,  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>'s	crew	had	succumbed	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">boarders	and	the	Enemy	had	made	their	way	to	Hawke	himself.	Something	else</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	happened	then,	a	point	that	Parks	still	struggled	on,	but	in	the	end	it	had	led</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	Hawke's	treachery.	The	man	had	then	been	beaten,	starved,	and	thrown	into	an</p>
<p class="calibre1">escape	pod,	where	he	was	left	to	drift	in	Independent	space	for	the	allied	forces</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	find	him.	It	was	meant	to	look	as	though	he	had	run	away	or	had	been	saved</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	 his	 crew,	 so	 that	 he	 alone	 might	 be	 able	 to	 tell	 of	 the	 fate	 that	 had	 befallen <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>,	and	therefore	aid	the	Confederation	in	its	recovery.	But	instead,	he	had been	working	against	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How	much	information	could	he	give	them	now,	Parks	wondered.	What	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 told	 them	 already?	 That	 didn't	 matter;	 the	 Enemy	 had	 tricked	 him	 and	 they had	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That	is	correct,	Commodore,”	Hawke	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks'	mind	raced,	searching	for	a	way	out.	The	Enemy	have	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon, </i>	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	they	have	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>.  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>.  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>.	Something	occurred	to	him;	he	had	to	stall	for time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anthony,	listen:	we	can	talk	this	through,”	Parks	said.	“Please;	allow	me	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">come	aboard	and	speak	with	Admiral	Zackaria.	We	can	work	something	out.	We</p>
<p class="calibre1">can	end	this	without	any	more	loss	of	life.	I	throw	myself	upon	the	mercy	of	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">Senate.”	He	knew	it	sounded	absurd;	so	very	melodramatic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	will	be	no	discussions,”	Hawke	said	in	a	flat	voice.	“There	has	been</p>
<p class="calibre1">too	much	talk	already.”	The	holographic	image	had	stopped	updating,	and	whilst</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	audio	was	still	quite	clear,	the	video	transmission	had	ceased. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	couldn't	be	certain	the	same	loss	would	be	true	for	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>,	but	he	had	to</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p292"></a>risk	 it.	 He	 was	 sure	 that	 Hawke	 would	 continue	 his	 gloat	 undeterred	 by	 the sudden	loss	of	visuals.	He	just	had	to	lure	him	in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your	plans	won't	work,	Anthony,”	Parks	said.	“There	are	too	many	flaws, </p>
<p class="calibre1">too	 many	 assumptions.	 We're	 already	 well	 prepared	 to	 exploit	 those</p>
<p class="calibre1">weaknesses...”	 He	 started	 to	 back	 away	 from	 the	 static	 holographic	 image, </p>
<p class="calibre1">beckoning	towards	Liu	with	one	hand.	The	man	rose	from	his	seat	and	prepared</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	assist	the	commodore	as	soon	as	he	was	prompted	further. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It	will	work	just	as	Fleet	Admiral	Turner	described	it,”	Hawke	said.	“The</p>
<p class="calibre1">ATAFs	will	join	our	frontline	forces	and	we	will	use	them	to	fulfil	the	Mission.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	not	 <i class="calibre4">your</i>	Mission,	Anthony!”	Parks	retorted.	“Listen	to	me:	you	are	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	of	them.”	He	shuffled	Weathers	out	of	her	seat,	gesturing	to	the	woman	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">keep	quiet.	He	quickly	took	her	place,	his	fingers	racing	across	the	surface	of	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">console,	 Liu	 giving	 him	 visual	 prompts	 as	 the	 man's	 plan	 began	 to	 come</p>
<p class="calibre1">together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	are	an	enlisted	officer	within	the	Confederation	Stellar	Navy,”	Parks</p>
<p class="calibre1">said.	“You	have	spent	a	good	part	of	your	life	with	the	service	and	your	time	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">dedication	to	serving	the	Confederacy	has	not	gone	unnoticed.	You	have	a	wife</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 one	 daughter,	 who	 has	 recently	 been	 accepted	 to	 study	 law	 at	 Cambridge</p>
<p class="calibre1">University,	thanks	to	your	own	efforts	to	never	give	up	on	her	and	motivate	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	achieve	her	dreams.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 Mission	 is	 more	 important	 than	 any	 of	 those	 things,”	 Hawke's	 voice</p>
<p class="calibre1">came.	 “All	 of	 those	 who	 oppose	 the	 rule	 of	 the	 Senate	 must	 be	 eradicated,	 as decreed	by	the	Senior	Magistrate.	It's	time	for	you	to	accept	it:	you	have	failed, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Commodore.	 You	 never	 were	 the	 man	 that	 Fleet	 Admiral	 Turner	 believed	 you</p>
<p class="calibre1">were.	Too	much	store	is	put	into	the	weak,	into	the	lenient,	into	the	modest	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	humble...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	did	not	hear	the	rest,	he	was	working	too	feverishly.	He	was	thankful</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 Hawke	 had	 taken	 the	 opportunity	 to	 gloat,	 though	 he	 knew	 that	 time	 was short,	 and	 at	 any	 moment	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	 would	 finish	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	 off.	 He	 heard	 a	 new	 voice speak	 over	 the	 comm	 link's	 still	 active	 audio	 channel.	 The	 words	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">unrecognisable	and	seemed	not	to	be	directed	at	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Time's	up,	Commodore,”	Hawke	announced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Captain,  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	is	readying	accelerators!”	Weathers	said	from	her	position	at</p>
<p class="calibre1">Liu's	console. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From	 where	 he	 sat,	 Parks	 did	 not	 need	 computer	 readouts	 for	 that	 kind	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">information:	at	this	range,	he	could	quite	clearly	see	the	green	lights,	running	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">length	 of	 the	 weapons'	 turrets,	 beginning	 to	 illuminate	 as	 they	 charged.  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i> was	mere	seconds	away	from	destruction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	looked	up	from	the	console,	towards	the	carrier	ahead	where	he	knew</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p293"></a>both	Hawke	and	Zackaria	would	be	staring	back	at	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,	preparing	to	witness its	final	few	moments	of	service.	Parks,	however,	was	not	quite	willing	to	give</p>
<p class="calibre1">them	that	pleasure	just	yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	know	how	the	saying	goes,	Commodore:	fool	me	once,	shame	on	you; </p>
<p class="calibre1">fool	 me	 twice...”	 A	 single	 confirmation	 request	 lay	 on	 the	 console's	 screen, Parks'	fingers	hovering	just	above	it.	“...	shame	on	me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks'	 fingers	 tapped	 the	 screen,	 executing	 the	 command	 he	 had	 taken	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">opportunity	 to	 set	 up.  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>'s	 plasma	 accelerators	 stopped	 charging,	 the	 lights along	the	turrets	extinguishing	as	if	they	were	flames	doused	by	water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Karen?”	Parks	looked	to	Weathers	for	further	confirmation	of	his	actions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>'s	 shielding,	 weaponry	 and	 engines	 have	 all	 been	 disabled,	 sir,”	 she said.	“Life	support	still	functional,	but...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bring	us	back	on-line,	Mr	Liu	and	get	us	out	of	here!”	Parks	interrupted, </p>
<p class="calibre1">rising	from	the	console. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where?”	 the	 uncertain	 navigator	 said.	 “Jump	 engines	 are	 likely	 to	 be</p>
<p class="calibre1">extremely	unstable	since	the	last	attack...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just	put	some	distance	between	us,	man!”	Parks	said.	Whilst	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	couldn't</p>
<p class="calibre1">return	fire	or	give	chase,	Parks	wanted	to	get	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	as	far	away	as	was	possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not	that	he	knew	where	they	were	going	to	go	or	what	they	would	do	once	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">recovered.	He	was	buying	time;	clutching	at	straws. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	 engines	 engaged	 and	 the	 carrier	 started	 forward,	 maintaining	 its same	 heading	 and	 slipping	 beneath	 its	 antagonist,	 though	 it	 was	 clear	 that	 the engines	were	lacking	the	power	they	had	possessed	at	the	time	they	had	departed</p>
<p class="calibre1">Spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I	can't	believe	that	actually	worked</i>,	Parks	found	himself	thinking.	The	idea</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	come	to	him	in	a	flash:	upon	seeing	Zackaria	sat	in	the	captain's	seat	on	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">holographic	screen,	he	had	become	angry	at	how	the	man	had	taken	not	one,	but</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	two	of	the	Navy's	most	prized	vessels.	He	had	gone	back	to	the	fateful	start</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 day,	 to	 when,	 during	 the	 preparations,	 he	 had	 been	 certain	 they	 would return	 home	 with	 what	 was	 once	 theirs.	 He	 then	 recalled	 how,	 prior	 to	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">commencement	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Operation	 Menelaus</i>,  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	 databanks	 had	 been	 loaded with	 the	 security	 credentials	 for	 deactivating	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>.	 The	 data	 bundle	 had, however,	 not	 been	 restricted	 to	 their	 mission	 target	 and	 had	 also	 contained	 the protocols	 to	 link	 to	 other	 Confederation	 capital	 ships;	 including	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>.	 With	 the realisation	that	Hawke	had	inadvertently	handed	him	the	advantage,	Parks	knew</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	had	only	to	keep	his	former	ally	talking	until	he	could	locate	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>'s	details. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though	he	thought	his	plan	to	be	quite	inspired,	he	was	unable	to	revel	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	victory;	it	looked	far	too	short-lived	in	his	eyes.	To	Zackaria	and	Hawke	this</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	only	a	temporary	set	back	and	one	way	or	another	they	would	be	on	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p294"></a>once	more.	And	when	that	time	came	they	would	not	hold	back	until	the	carrier was	reduced	to	nothing	but	a	burnt-out	shell. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Zackaria	rose	from	the	captain's	chair,	joining	Hawke	where	he	stood	at	the	front</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 carrier	 and	 ordered	 him	 to	 prevent	 the	 enemy's	 escape.

Though <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	 could	 not	 follow	 or	 fire	 upon	 Parks'	 ship	 itself,	 the	 Confederation	 fighters ready	and	waiting	on	the	flight	deck	were	unaffected	by	the	power	outage. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Hawke	watched	as	the	first	group	of	fighters	shot	out	in	front	of	the	carrier, </p>
<p class="calibre1">knowing	there	was	little	chance	that	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	would	be	able	to	outrun	or	fend	off an	assault	from	close	to	one	hundred	simultaneous	attackers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The	 pack	 of	 hijacked	 Confederation	 fighters	 scattered	 like	 a	 frightened</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p296"></a>Dodds	 was	 suffering	 a	 range	 of	 emotions	 from	 the	 events	 of	 the	 day:	 he	 was hungry	from	not	having	eaten	since	the	breakfast	he	had	picked	at	that	morning, </p>
<p class="calibre1">weary	from	the	lack	of	proper	sleep,	and	sore	from	the	encounter	at	Arlos. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Dodds	noted	that	running	lights	were	once	again	dotting	the	carrier	and	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	ship	was	turning	to	begin	pursuit	of	its	former	ally	in	battle.	He	brought	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">fighter	about	to	look	over	the	hulking	mass	of	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>,	never	before	having	been so	 close	 to	 the	 battleship	 in	 his	 life.

<p class="calibre1">would	not	risk	being	caught	up	in	the	fallout	from	the	assault. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 felt	 powerless.	 There	 was	 nothing	 he	 could	 do	 to	 prevent	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>'s advance.	His	comms	popped;	it	was	Parks. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p299"></a>Dodds	 swore,	 though	 his	 words	 were	 lost	 within	 the	 collective	 gasps	 and words	of	disbelief	from	his	fellow	wingmates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 all	 witnessed	 the	 power	 of	 that	 battleship's	 main	 gun	 earlier,”	 Parks</p>
<p class="calibre1">said,	undeterred.	“We	cannot	allow	it	to	gain	a	lock	on	us.	If	it	does,	then	it's	all</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Sir..?”	Estelle's	concerned	voice	came. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don't	panic,	de	Winter:	you	will	be	targeting	power	systems	only.	There	is</p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">That's	not	what	she's	worried	about</i>,	Dodds	thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	 combined	 power	 in	 those	 accelerators	 should	 be	 enough	 to	 break</p>

<p class="calibre1">Dodds	looked	over	the	colossal	battleship.	Chaz's	words	came	into	his	head, </p>
<p class="calibre1">of	how	the	number	of	fighters	the	allied	forces	were	bringing	to	the	table	were</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	 match	 for	 it.	 Back	 then,	 during	 the	 commencement	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Operation	 Menelaus</i>, there	had	been	several	hundred.	Now	there	were	five. </p>

<p class="calibre1">what	else	could	they	do?	They	had	to	at	least	try.	It	seemed	that	as	much	as	the</p>

<p class="calibre1">Dodds'	 console	 jingled.	 The	 restriction	 on	 the	 accelerator	 had	 been	 lifted</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	Parks'	coordinates	had	been	received.	He	glanced	again	to	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	and	set	to work	utilizing	the	data	and	preparing	the	cannon.	He	then	swung	his	craft	up	and</p>

<p class="calibre1">Rissard	watched	as	the	ATAFs	changed	their	heading,	breaking	away	from	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">engagements	 with	 the	 Confederation	 fighters	 and	 brought	 themselves	 into	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">staggered	horizontal	formation	toward	the	battleship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unperturbed	 by	 their	 sudden	 interest	 in	 his	 ship,	 he	 ordered	 that	 they	 be</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p300"></a>were	 inexplicably	 drawn	 back	 to	 the	 camera	 tracking	 the	 black	 Confederation fighters.	The	ATAFs	came	into	range... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moments	 later,	 a	 thick,	 bright	 green	 stream	 of	 plasma	 erupted	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">belly	of	the	lead,	striking	the	broadside	of	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>.	Beams	from	the	four	others joined	it,	aiming	for	the	same	point.	There	was	a	call	from	somewhere	down	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">bridge	-	the	 shield	generators	were	 struggling.	The	lead	 changed	their	 heading, </p>
<p class="calibre1">sweeping	the	beam	along	the	hull.	Its	path	was	followed	by	the	four	others,	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">banked	hard	to	trace	the	line.	Against	the	concentrated	plasma	beams,	the	shield</p>
<p class="calibre1">quadrant	held	for	only	a	few	seconds	before	it	collapsed.	Bright	splinters	erupted</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>'s	broadside,	as	though	someone	had	just	shot	a	cannon	ball	through</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	huge	stained	glass	window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	the	shield	gone,	and	with	nothing	to	protect	it,	the	beams	proceeded	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">cut	straight	into	the	hull,	tearing	open	the	armour	as	they	went. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 black-suited	 crew	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	 fell	 about	 as	 the	 battleship	 lurched</p>
<p class="calibre1">violently	 from	 the	 assault.	 Lights	 and	 operational	 computer	 arrays	 failed.	 Then the	 gravitational	 systems	 failed.	 Rissard	 felt	 his	 feet	 lift	 off	 the	 floor	 of	 the darkened	bridge	and	he	found	him	floating	around	helplessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By	 the	 time	 the	 ATAFs	 had	 concluded	 their	 sweep,	 a	 large	 scar	 ran	 deep</p>
<p class="calibre1">across	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>'s	 starboard	 side,	 venting	 gases,	 chemicals,	 and	 the	 splintered remnants	 of	 protective	 armour	 plating.	 The	 graphic	 of	 the	 magnificent	 Chinese dragon	had	become	a	shadow	of	its	former	self,	a	sordid	blackened	mark	running</p>
<p class="calibre1">across	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	short	time	later,	the	emergency	systems	engaged	and	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>'s	occupants</p>
<p class="calibre1">were	sent	crashing	back	to	the	ground.	Rissard	picked	himself	up	as	the	ATAFs</p>
<p class="calibre1">swooped	past	the	bridge's	frontal	viewport	and	ordered	the	crew	to	resume	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">pursuit	of	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>.	His	request	was	denied,	reports	coming	in	detailing	the	state of	the	ship	in	wake	of	the	attack:	the	main	cannon	lacked	the	power	it	needed	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">fire,	shielding	and	weaponry	were	now	in	an	unreliable	state,	the	flight	deck	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">suffered	significant	damage,	and	the	power	generators	were	in	need	of	repair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rissard	 glowered	 as	 he	 watched	 the	 five	 starfighters	 pass	 by	 and	 ordered</p>

<p class="calibre1">“That's	 enough!”	 Estelle	 said,	 as	 they	 completed	 their	 run.	 “Get	 back	 on	 the fighters!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds'	scepticism	of	Parks'	plan	had	been	high.	He	couldn't	see	any	way	in</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p301"></a>which	 it	 could	 actually	 succeed.	 And	 yet	 it	 had!	 And	 as	 he	 pulled	 away	 from <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>,	it	looked	for	all	intents	and	purposes	that	the	battleship	was	no	longer able	to	participate	in	the	battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 had	 watched	 as	 the	 accelerator	 beams	 had	 hit	 their	 target's	 shield, </p>
<p class="calibre1">promising	to	do	little	else	but	prove	just	how	well-protected	the	legendary	vessel</p>
<p class="calibre1">was.	And	then,	as	he	had	followed	Estelle's	lead,	he	had	seen	the	shield	give	way</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	the	beams	which	had	cut	through	into	the	hull.	They	had	sliced	and	torn	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">ripped	their	way	through	the	armour,	cutting	it	apart	like	thin	fabric. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	found	it	almost	impossible	to	tear	his	eyes	away	from	what	they	had	just</p>
<p class="calibre1">achieved,	 and	 again	 the	 questions	 about	 just	 what	 this	 craft	 was	 he	 was	 in command	of	began	to	rise	within	him.	Twenty-four	hours	earlier	his	world	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	a	very	different	place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 now	 was	 not	 the	 time	 to	 contemplate	 such	 things.	 He	 pushed	 them	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	back	of	his	mind,	turned	away	from	the	crippled	battleship	and	started	back</p>
<p class="calibre1">towards	 what	 remained	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>'s	 fighter	 complement.	 Now	 the	 battle	  <i class="calibre4">was</i>	 won! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 day	 was	 theirs!	 He	 was	 just	 separating	 out	 a	 target,	 when	 a	 number	 of flashes	 drew	 his	 attention.	 He	 caught	 his	 breath;	 his	 jaw	 dropped.	 From	 out	 of the	fresh	jump	points	emerged	six	Imperial	frigates,	accompanied	by	a	multitude</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	Imperial	starfighters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“oh	my	god,”	he	gasped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	could	be	about	to	become	unstuck	here,	guys,”	Enrique	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds'	 eyes	 darted	 from	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>,	 to	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>,	 to	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,	 to	 the	 frigates,	 to	 the fighters.	 He	 felt	 his	 world	 collapse,	 not	 sure	 of	 how	 to	 begin	 dealing	 with	 the reinforcements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dear	God,	there's	a	lot	of	them,”	Kelly	breathed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Doesn't	 matter,”	 Estelle	 said.	 “We	 need	 to	 keep	 them	 away	 from	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Go	to	it,	people!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 did	 as	 his	 wing	 commander	 ordered,	 but	 his	 own	 personal	 feelings</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 the	 matter	 mirrored	 those	 of	 Enrique	 and	 Kelly.	 The	 incoming	 Imperial</p>
<p class="calibre1">fighters	 squadrons	 was	 made	 up	 of	 almost	 everything	 the	 INF	 possessed:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Sphinxes,	Mantises,	Jackals,	Scarabs...	He	had	never	seen	anything	like	it.	And</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	numbers!	They	were	insurmountable!	This	was	not	an	Imperial	force	that	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">knew	of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With	a	burst	of	speed,	the	fighters	accelerated	away	from	the	frigates	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	 been	 escorting,	 aligning	 themselves	 with	 the	 sleek	 black	 starfighters	 and almost	 defenceless	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	 beyond.	 Weapon	 struts	 deployed	 from	 the	 egg-like body	 of	 the	 Mantises,	 locking	 into	 place	 and	 presenting	 fully-loaded	 missile</p>
<p class="calibre1">hardpoints	below. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 drove	 himself	 into	 the	 huge	 squadron	 of	 fighters,	 the	 pack	 looking</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p302"></a>like	 so	 many	 birds	 migrating	 all	 at	 once.	 He	 could	 not	 count	 the	 odds	 stacked against	 them,	 suffice	 to	 say	 one	 thing	 was	 all	 too	 clear:	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	 were	 now heavily	outnumbered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 frontline	 Imperial	 fighters	 opened	 up	 with	 a	 full	 barrage	 against	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">five	approaching	ATAFs,	multicoloured	light	from	various	weapon	fire	reflecting</p>
<p class="calibre1">off	 the	 starfighter's	 armour	 as	 it	 passed	 by	 them,	 all	 five	 of	 the	  <i class="calibre4">White	 Knights' </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">crafts'	shielding	rippling	with	the	impact	of	the	shots.	Missiles	from	the	backline</p>
<p class="calibre1">followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">There	are	too	many, </i>	Dodds	thought,	only	minutes	into	the	fight,	feeling	his</p>
<p class="calibre1">zeal	beginning	to	slip.	Even	so,	he	kept	his	mouth	shut,	trying	to	focus	himself</p>
<p class="calibre1">better.	 The	 swarm	 of	 fighters	 on	 his	 radar	 and	 outside	 his	 cockpit	 had	 become overwhelming.	 His	 intercom	 was	 exploding	 with	 chatter,	 and	 every	 one	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">voices	was	frantic,	urgent	and	very,	very	worried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many	 of	 the	 fighters	 were	 striking	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	 now.	 The	 carrier	 was	 making	 a valiant	bid	at	protecting	herself,	but	with	only	its	rear	cannons	still	undamaged, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	cracks	in	its	defence	were	all	too	wide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 broke	 off	 his	 engagement,	 pushing	 back	 through	 the	 cluster	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">adversaries	 and	 towards	 the	 bombers	 that	 were	 of	 the	 greatest	 threat	 to	 the survival	of	the	carrier.	His	HUD	tagged	them	with	missiles	and	he	loosed	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 instant	 they	 were	 locked.	 They	 were	 joined	 by	 a	 hail	 of	 plasma	 fire	 from another	ATAF	that	was	quick	to	enter	and	leave	his	view.	He	gave	no	thought	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">whom	it	may	have	been;	nor	did	he	seek	to	ask.	There	simply	wasn't	time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	bombers	fell.	He	swung	back	around	to	the	cluster	of	Imperial	forces, </p>
<p class="calibre1">trying	hard	to	overcome	the	sinking	feeling	that	was	consuming	his	every	being. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	he	couldn't	shake	it:	this	was	it;	this	was	where	it	was	going	to	end... </p>

<p class="calibre1">Watching	 the	 bombers	 fall	 and	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	re-focusing	their	efforts	on	keeping the	next	wave	away	from	his	ship,	Parks	found	himself	stuck	between	a	rock	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	 hard	 place.	 For	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin	 </i> to	 remain	 here	 would	 almost	 certainly	 lead	 to	 its destruction,	 in	 the	 face	 of	 such	 overwhelming	 odds.

<p class="calibre1">“Dodds.”	 Hawke	 did	 not	 need	 to	 be	 told	 who	 was	 piloting	 the	 ATAF	 that	 was streaking	towards	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>'s	bridge;	he	instinctively	knew	that	only	one	man	could	be so	arrogant	as	to	pull	off	such	a	manoeuvre	when	everyone	else	was	falling	back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	barked	an	order	to	the	crew	to	concentrate	the	carrier's	fire	on	the	fighter,	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	ATAF	aligned	itself	with	the	bridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 a	 moment,	 Hawke's	 eyes	 widened.	 It	 was	 going	 to	 ram	 them!	 At	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">same	moment,	a	barrage	of	fire	issued	from	beneath	the	ATAF's	wings	and	sped</p>
<p class="calibre1">towards	 the	 bridge's	 viewport,	 almost	 right	 where	 the	 Imperial	 admiral	 and	 the former	 Confederation	 commodore	 were	 standing.	 The	 bolts	 slammed	 headlong</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	the	bridge's	frontal	shield	quadrant,	at	first	striking	it	like	raindrops	upon	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">sheet	 of	 glass.	 A	 number	 of	 seconds	 later,	 the	 shield	 collapsed,	 unable	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">withstand	the	continuous	hail	of	fire	being	directed	at	it.	The	ATAF	pulled	away</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	its	collision	course,	its	work	done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawke	 saw	 the	 bridge's	 shield	 quadrant	 splinter	 for	 an	 instant	 before	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">remaining	bolts	crashed	unhindered	into	the	bridge's	main	viewport.	Huge	web-</p>
<p class="calibre1">like	 cracks	 began	 to	 sprout	 at	 the	 points	 of	 impact,	 and	 both	 he	 and	 Zackaria turned	to	evacuate	the	bridge	while	they	still	could,	the	black-clad	soldiers	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">occupied	 seats	 and	 consoles	 springing	 up	 to	 follow	 them.	 The	 next	 instant,	 the last	set	of	bolts	shattered	the	frontal	viewport. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawke	managed	to	steady	himself	for	but	a	fraction	of	a	second	before	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">tremendous	 force	 of	 depressurisation	 yanked	 him	 backwards.	 He	 crashed	 into</p>
<p class="calibre1">one	 of	 the	 forward	 control	 consoles,	 fingers	 scrambling	 for	 purchase	 about	 the long	 edge.	 A	 warning	 sounded	 on	 the	 bridge	 and	 a	 pair	 of	 large	 blast	 screens starting	to	close,	to	contain	the	exposure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zackaria	 tumbled	 over	 backwards,	 straight	 through	 the	 middle	 of	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">shattered	window	and	out	into	space,	the	blast	screens	coming	too	late	to	prevent</p>
<p class="calibre1">his	 departure.	 Hawke	 followed,	 losing	 his	 grip	 on	 the	 console	 that	 had	 at	 one time	promised	to	spare	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More	 than	 half	 of	 the	 bridge	 crew	 were	 condemned	 to	 the	 same	 fate	 as</p>
<p class="calibre1">Zackaria	 and	 Hawke,	 unable	 to	 prevent	 themselves	 from	 being	 jettisoned	 from</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p305"></a>Commodore	 Hawke	 have	 been	 spaced.	 Enemy	 forces	 have	 also	 ceased attacking.”	He	sounded	confused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bring	us	about,”	Parks	said,	wanting	to	see	for	himself.	The	carrier	turned</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	 to	 face	 the	 enemy	 forces,	 and	 as	 the	 numerous	 capital	 ships	 and	 fighters came	 into	 view,	 Parks	 saw	 that	 the	 scene	 had	 become	 a	 good	 deal	 calmer	 than the	chaos	and	savagery	of	the	battle	that	had	proceeded	it.	A	tremendous	amount</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	debris	and	wreckage	tumbled	about,	but	now	guns	on	both	sides	were	silent.	It</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	as	if	they	had	all	at	once	reached	a	stalemate. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	slowed	and	looked	about	from	his	run	to	see	a	number	of	flailing	bodies</p>
<p class="calibre1">tumbling	out	across	the	surface	of	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>.	A	small	feeling	of	satisfaction	welled	up within	him	as	he	made	out	what	appeared	to	be	the	unprotected	body	of	Hawke</p>
<p class="calibre1">amongst	 them.	 In	 their	 current	 state,	 Dodds	 gave	 them	 all	 only	 a	 couple	 of minutes	 before	 they	 succumbed	 to	 the	 vacuum;	 although,	 after	 what	 he	 had</p>
<p class="calibre1">witnessed	back	at	Arlos	he	would	not	be	surprised	if	they	survived	a	little	past</p>
<p class="calibre1">that.	Whatever	it	was,	they	would	not	last	very	long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As	 he	 continued	 to	 watch	 the	 bodies	 floating	 along,	 Dodds	 became	 aware</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 he	 was	 no	 longer	 being	 fired	 upon;	 and	 nor	 was	 anyone	 else.	 The	 enemy forces	 had	 ceased	 their	 attack	 on	 him,	 the	 other	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>,	and	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,	 and	 were instead	milling	around	close	to	where	the	bodies	tumbled.	He	remained	where	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">was,	watching	the	Imperial	and	stolen	Confederation	fighters	breaking	away	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">turning	 back	 towards	  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	 and	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>.	 He	 saw	 a	 Ray	 ahead	 of	 him	 slow,	 turn and	accelerate	away,	without	any	intimidation	of	the	ATAF	before	it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What's	going	on?”	It	was	Kelly,	sounding	quite	bewildered.	“Why	did	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">stop	attacking?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I...	 I	 don't	 know,”	 Estelle	 said,	 sounding	 just	 as	 bemused	 by	 what	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">occurring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They're	 worried	 about	 hitting	 Zackaria,”	 Chaz	 said.	 “They	 don't	 want	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">risk	their	leader	being	killed	by	a	stray	shot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Speaking	of	which,	good	shooting,	Dodds,”	Enrique	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	good	shooting,”	Estelle	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	had	half	expected	her	to	lecture	him,	but	his	wing	leader	had	decided</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 pass	 on	 the	 verbal	 slap.	 He	 brought	 his	 ATAF	 down	 to	 where	 Hawke	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Zackaria	tumbled,	reducing	his	speed	to	that	of	a	crawl	so	that	he	could	examine</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 bodies	 up	 close.	 He	 moved	 unopposed,	 passing	 by	 an	 Imperial	 fighter	 so</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p306"></a>close	that	he	could	see	the	occupant	within	the	craft.	The	pilot,	clothed	in	black and	wearing	a	dark	helmet	with	ruby-red	eyes,	paid	him	no	attention	whatsoever, </p>
<p class="calibre1">their	focus	on	the	commodore	and	admiral	who	were	so	very	close	to	death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 came	 within	 just	 a	 few	 meters	 of	 Hawke,	 seeing	 the	 commodore's</p>
<p class="calibre1">face	 contorted	 in	 a	 mixture	 of	 pain	 and	 disbelief.	 Even	 with	 the	 twisted</p>
<p class="calibre1">expression,	 Dodds	 noticed	 just	 how	 smooth,	 healthy-	 and	 young-looking</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawke's	 skin	 appeared;	 like	 that	 of	 the	 soldier	 whose	 helmet	 he	 had	 removed only	 hours	 earlier.	 The	 man's	 eyes	 were	 shut	 tight.	 Dodds	 guessed	 that	 he	 had already	lost	consciousness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 then	 glanced	 to	 Zackaria	 and	 gave	 a	 start.	 The	 admiral	 was	 staring	 at</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	with	an	expression	that	Dodds	would	not	soon	forget:	something	had	fought</p>
<p class="calibre1">itself	 up	 from	 deep	 inside	 the	 man;	 something	 angry.	 It	 was	 a	 threatening	 look that	almost	spoke	to	him	through	the	vacuum	of	space. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">My	 God!	 He's	 still	 alive! </i>	 Dodds	 thought.  <i class="calibre4">But...	 that's	 impossible! </i>	 He	 then recalled	what	had	happened	at	Arlos.	So	was	that.	Dodds	noticed	how,	unlike	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">soldier's	 and	 Hawke's	 faces,	 Zackaria's	 was	 neither	 youthful	 nor	 unnaturally</p>
<p class="calibre1">healthy-looking.	 And	 though	 he	 did	 appear	 old,	 his	 face	 had	 more	 of	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">distinguished	and	reverent	appearance	to	it.	It	demanded	respect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Zackaria	never	took	his	eyes	off	Dodds	as	he	went	by	and	the	young	pilot</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	 not	 help	 but	 think	 that	 he	 was	 studying	 him,	 marking	 him,	 remembering him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds'	comms	were	chattering	with	the	sound	of	many	different	voices,	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">four	 of	 the	  <i class="calibre4">White	 Knights</i>	 trying	 to	 get	 his	 attention.	 He	 ignored	 all	 of	 them watching	as,	in	the	sudden	still	of	the	battle,	a	number	of	transport	craft	passed</p>
<p class="calibre1">by	him,	stopping	to	pick	up	the	soldiers	that	had	been	jettisoned	from	the	bridge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One	slowed	close	to	Hawke	and	Zackaria,	the	two	men	being	drawn	inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Commodore...”	Dodds	started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stand	 down,	 Lieutenant.	 Return	 to	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,”	 Parks	 said,	 pre-empting	 his question	of	whether	he	should	destroy	the	transports	or	leave	them	be.	Dodds	did</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	 argue	 with	 Parks	 and	 fell	 back	 towards	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,	 coming	 up	 alongside	 the other	ATAFs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Together,	the	team	watched	as	the	transports	flocked	back	towards	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>, </p>
<p class="calibre1">the	huge	battleship	turning	itself	away	from	the	Confederation	forces	with	their</p>
<p class="calibre1">approach.	Then,	one	after	another,  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	and	the	frigates	opened	jump	points</p>

<p class="calibre1">Meyers	 arrived	 in	 the	 Phylent	 system	 less	 than	 half	 an	 hour	 after	 the	 Imperial naval	forces	had	departed.	He	apologised	profusely	to	Parks	for	the	time	it	had</p>
<p class="calibre1">taken	 him	 to	 reach	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,	 despite	 matters	 being	 well	 out	 of	 his	 control.	 Parks had	waved	away	the	apology	and	together	the	two	men	began	to	organise	repairs</p>

<p class="calibre1">Wyatt	 frowned.	 “But,	 sir...	 with	 all	 due	 respect,	 they	 are	 just	 galley	 hands and...” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 have	 my	 orders,”	 Parks	 said,	 not	 prepared	 to	 argue	 with	 or	 hear	 the</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Yes,	Captain.  <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	is	ready	for	command.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,”	Parks	 said,	dismissing	the	 man	before	turning	 to	Meyers.	“I</p>
<p class="calibre1">don't	know	about	you,	but	I've	had	enough	of	this	system	for	one	day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	can	more	than	appreciate	that,	Commodore,”	Meyers	said.	“I	will	return</p>

<p class="calibre1">Parks	 walked	 over	 to	 the	 captain's	 chair	 and	 slumped	 down,	 feeling	 both</p>

<p class="calibre1">Whilst	he	waited	for	Meyers	to	give	him	the	all-clear	on	the	skeleton	crew</p>

<p class="calibre1">now	 visible	 in	 the	 restored	 light,	 were	 lowering	 weapons.	 It	 was	 a	 wise	 and natural	precaution	to	finding	a	pod	drifting	in	space,	the	UNF	becoming	wise	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	 Enemy	 tactic	 now.	 Nel	 then	 indicated	 to	 her	 group	 that	 they	 no	 longer needed	their	weapons.	The	men	and	women	lowered	their	aim,	though	they	still</p>
<p class="calibre1">kept	a	watchful	eye	on	the	woman	before	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Could	 someone	 get	 my	 clothes?”	 Natalia	 asked,	 dropping	 her	 arms	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p311"></a>wrapping	 them	 around	 herself.	 She	 was	 wearing	 nothing	 except	 for	 the underwear	 she	 had	 on	 when	 she	 had	 stepped	 into	 the	 stasis	 capsule.	 Though</p>
<p class="calibre1">confronted	with	a	half-naked	woman,	the	faces	of	the	men	in	the	group	remained</p>
<p class="calibre1">deadpan,	 as	 though	 they	 had,	 and	 still	 were,	 expecting	 to	 be	 met	 by	 something far	worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Suresh,”	Nel	instructed	a	man	who	trotted	past	Natalia	and	into	the	pod	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">retrieve	her	clothing,	whilst	Nel	herself	came	forward	and	embraced	her	friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	two	women	hugged	for	a	while,	then	Natalia	burst	into	floods	of	tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	right,	all	right,”	Nel	said,	rubbing	Natalia's	back.	“You're	safe.	We	saw</p>
<p class="calibre1">your	 pod	 drifting	 and	 decided	 to	 risk	 a	 pick-up.	 You're	 aboard	  <i class="calibre4">Cratos</i>,	 so	 it'll take	something	sizeable	before	you	need	to	worry	again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank	you,”	Natalia	sniffed,	squeezing	Nel	in	a	tight	embrace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A	 short	 time	 later,	 the	 man	 named	 Suresh	 returned	 with	 Natalia's	 clothes</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	she	gratefully	began	to	pull	them	back	on.	The	bay	was	not	very	warm	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">already	she	had	begun	to	shiver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Where...	where	is	everyone	else?”	Nel	asked,	glancing	behind	the	unkempt</p>
<p class="calibre1">blonde	woman	and	into	the	empty	pod;	although	from	the	look	in	Natalia's	eyes, </p>
<p class="calibre1">she	believed	she	already	knew	the	answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They...	didn't	make	it,”	Natalia	said.	She	reached	into	the	jacket	she	was	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 process	 of	 zipping	 up	 and	 handed	 over	 the	 id	 card	 that	 had	 belonged	 to Porter,	along	with	a	few	others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I'm	sorry,”	Nel	said,	shaking	her	head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 did	 manage	 to	 complete	 our	 mission.	 We	 hit	 and	 destroyed	 all	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">targets,”	Natalia	announced,	and	once	more	handed	over	a	number	of	small	data</p>
<p class="calibre1">cards,	containing	her	own	and	other	peoples'	mission	reports. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 mean	 you	 hit	 all	 the	 targets	 that	 we	 knew	 about,”	 Nel	 said.	 “The</p>
<p class="calibre1">situation	 is	 far	 more	 dire	 than	 any	 of	 us	 could	 ever	 have	 imagined.	 We've</p>
<p class="calibre1">essentially	 shut	 the	 gate	 after	 the	 horse	 has	 bolted,”	 she	 added	 at	 the	 sight	 of Natalia's	face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	many	more...”	Natalia	began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We'll	 discuss	 that	 later,”	 Nel	 said,	 gesturing	 for	 Natalia	 to	 follow	 her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let's	get	you	cleaned	up	and	checked	out	first.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At	 the	 news	 that	 her	 mission	 had	 only	 been	 a	 partial	 success,	 Natalia	 felt her	 world	 collapsing	 around	 her.	 She	 had	 been	 through	 so	 much,	 had	 lost	 so many	friends	and	risked	everything	to	accomplish	her	goals.	And	now	it	seemed</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	have	all	been	for	nothing.	A	sense	of	despair	washed	over	her	and	she	felt	as</p>
<p class="calibre1">though	 she	 might	 vomit	 and	 pass	 out.	 Sensing	 Natalia's	 anguish	 growing,	 Nel</p>
<p class="calibre1">attempted	to	comfort	her	and	then,	after	taking	one	last	look	back	at	the	escape</p>
<p class="calibre1">pod,	the	pair	left	the	hangar. </p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">To	add	further	to	this	structure,	there	does	not	appear	to	be	any	kind	of	law</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">(military	 or	 otherwise)	 at	 work.	 One	 does	 not	 seem	 needed	 since,	 as	 already</i> <i class="calibre4">stated,	everyone	works	together	as	one	cohesive	unit.	There	is	no	stepping	out	of</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">line	and	no	misbehaviour	apparent.	No-one	acts	out	of	personal	gain,	but	only	to</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">benefit	 the	 whole.	 Having	 said	 that,	 there	 is	 neither	 punishment	 for	 failure	 nor</i> <i class="calibre4">reward	 for	 success.

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">old	are	equal	in	all	circumstances. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Physiologically,	 the	 Pandoran	 soldiers	 are	 nothing	 short	 of	 incredible. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Damage	to	skin	and	tissue	is	repaired	with	amazing	speed;	seconds	rather	than</i></p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Enemy's	healing	abilities. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I	 have	 also	 been	 able	 to	 confirm	 that	 all	 Pandoran	 soldiers	 benefit	 from</i> <i class="calibre4">physical	 augmentation.	 In	 hand-to-hand	 combat	 all	 combatants	 display</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">incredible	 strength,	 far	 greater	 than	 normal.	 Their	 outward	 appearance	 is</i></p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">ordinary	 ones.	 This	 incredible	 power	 is	 present	 within	 both	 men	 and	 women,</i> <i class="calibre4">with	little	to	no	difference	in	ability.	They	also	display	unbelievable	dexterity	and</i> <i class="calibre4">exceptionally	 fast	 reflexes.	 In	 addition,	 all	 Pandoran	 soldiers	 benefit	 from</i> <i class="calibre4">greatly	increased	height	-	six	foot	five	inches	being	the	approximate	average.	At</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">this	 time,	 I	 cannot	 offer	 an	 explanation	 for	 this	 and	 can	 only	 assume	 it	 is	 a</i> <i class="calibre4">psychological	 attribute	 aimed	 at	 intimidating	 the	 opposition.	 I	 can	 confirm</i> <i class="calibre4">firsthand	 that	 if	 this	 is	 the	 case,	 then	 it	 is	 truly	 effective.	 A	 charging,	 hundred-strong	 regiment	 of	 these	 soldiers,	 fully	 armed,	 would	 strike	 a	 degree	 of	 unease</i> <i class="calibre4">into	even	the	most	hardened	of	opponents. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Psychologically,	 the	 Enemy	 are,	 once	 again,	 remarkable.	 Their	 knowledge</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">of	how	to	command	and	operate	all	manner	of	Imperial	weaponry,	vehicles	and</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">vessels	appears	to	be	without	limits.	A	soldier	can	know	all	they	need	to	about	a</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p314"></a> <i class="calibre4">weapon	without	any	prior	experience	or	the	need	to	practice	with	it	beforehand. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">They	 are	 able	 to	 maximise	 the	 weapon's	 full	 potential,	 whilst	 at	 the	 same	 time</i> <i class="calibre4">compensate	for	its	limits.	So	far	we	have	not	been	able	to	clarify	whether	or	not</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">this	knowledge	extends	outside	the	bounds	of	Imperial	engineering,	and	it	could</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">well	be	that	a	period	of	learning	would	be	necessary	in	order	to	operate	new	and</i></p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">They	 are	 code	 talkers.	 This	 makes	 it	 near-impossible	 for	 us	 to	 decipher</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">what	 they	 are	 saying	 to	 one	 another,	 whether	 it	 be	 in	 a	 combat	 situation,	 a</i> <i class="calibre4">standard	communication	or	otherwise.	The	cipher	code	itself	seems	to	also	shift</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">on	 a	 regular	 basis.	 The	 schedule	 for	 this	 change	 has	 never	 been	 determined,</i> <i class="calibre4">since	it	itself	seems	to	be	subject	to	a	form	of	encryption.	It	is	doubtful	that	we</i> <i class="calibre4">will	 ever	 be	 able	 to	 crack	 their	 tongue,	 and	 whilst	 they	 are	 all	 able	 to	 speak</i> <i class="calibre4">English,	they	do	so	only	in	extreme	cases. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Their	primary	goal	is	not	to	conquer,	but	to	destroy	without	prejudice.	With</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">what	 I	 have	 garnered	 so	 far,	 we	 should	 be	 very,	 very	 concerned	 about	 the</i> <i class="calibre4">Pandoran's	 desire	 to	 press	 on	 from	 the	 Imperial	 systems	 and	 into	 Independent</i> <i class="calibre4">World	 space.

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">They	 do	 not	 appear	 to	 have	 the	 knowledge	 of	 building	 spacecraft</i></p>

Unless	we	can	find	a	way	to	slow	the	speed	of	their	advance,	then	I</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">anticipate	 that	 they	 will	 be	 ready	 for	 a	 full	 strike	 against	 neighbouring	 IW</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">systems	within	the	next	six	months,	if	not	sooner.	And	when	they	do,	I	think	we</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">can	 expect	 the	 same	 approach	 that	 they	 took	 to	 the	 Imperial	 worlds:	 prisoners</i> <i class="calibre4">will	not	be	taken,	lives	will	not	be	spared.	They	are	heartless,	cruel	and	without</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">pity;	the	perfect	killing	machines. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">A	conflict	with	the	Enemy	is	both	inevitable	and	unavoidable,	and	for	such</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">an	 eventuality	 we	 should	 immediately	 prepare.	 Some	 will	 believe	 that	 we	 are</i> <i class="calibre4">facing	 an	 alien	 invader,	 and	 that	 humanity's	 first	 encounter	 with	 an</i></p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">fashion.	At	her	approach,	Dodds	struggled	harder	against	his	captor.	He	tried	to</i></p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">As	Barber	approached,	Dodds	noticed	the	corpses	on	the	floor	beginning	to</i></p>

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">the	sound	of	body	parts	slapping	on	the	ground.	Another	hand	closed	around	his</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">leg	and	the	owner	tried	to	pull	themselves	up.	He	took	the	only	action	he	could</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">and	 began	 punching	 wildly	 at	 the	 faces	 of	 those	 that	 held	 him.	 Grips	 were</i> <i class="calibre4">released	and	he	sprang	free,	resuming	his	journey	back	towards	to	the	airlock,	to</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">join	his	friends. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">He	rounded	the	corner	and	saw	them	standing,	with	their	backs	to	him,	in</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">the	 chamber.	 They	 were	 affixing	 helmets	 and	 ensuring	 they	 were	 ready	 for	 the</i> <i class="calibre4">evacuation	into	space.	The	doors	were	already	sealed. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Dodds	 sprinted	 up	 to	 the	 door	 and	 began	 thumping	 on	 the	 thick	 glass, </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">shouting	as	best	he	could.	Still	there	was	no	sound,	not	from	his	throat	and	not</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">from	 his	 hand	 hitting	 the	 glass.	 His	 wingmates	 remained	 oblivious	 to	 his</i> <i class="calibre4">presence.

<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">soldiers.	 Their	 clothes	 were	 blood	 soaked,	 their	 limbs	 perforated	 from	 multiple</i> <i class="calibre4">gunshots...	and	they	had	him	cornered. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Pandoran,	Pandoran,	Pandoran. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">The	 words	 came	 as	 a	 flat,	 eerie	 chorus,	 reverberating	 off	 the	 walls	 and</i> <i class="calibre4">seeping	into	his	bones,	threatening	to	draw	out	his	very	soul. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Dodds	 realised	 there	 was	 nowhere	 for	 him	 to	 run;	 his	 back	 was	 against	 a</i> <i class="calibre4">wall.	He	panicked	and	turned	around.	He	banged	on	the	window	again,	harder</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">than	before,	but	both	he	and	the	glass	remained	as	muted	and	uncommunicative</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">as	ever.	The	chamber	was	bathed	in	flashing	red	hues	and	he	watched	in	horror</i></p>

<p class="calibre1">Dodds	woke,	finding	himself	on	the	top	bunk	of	the	bed	he	had	fallen	asleep	on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	was	sweating	profusely.	He	had	no	idea	of	how	long	he	had	been	asleep,	nor</p>
<p class="calibre1">how	long	it	might	be	before	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>	and	the	other	two	carriers	returned	to	Spirit, but	right	now	he	was	happy	to	lie	where	he	was	and	wait.	Although	it	had	only</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	a	dream,	in	light	of	what	he	had	experienced	that	day	it	had	not	seemed	all</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	far	detached	from	reality.	He	rubbed	the	sleep	from	his	eyes	and	decided	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	rather	remain	awake	for	the	remainder	of	the	journey	home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	glanced	down	at	Enrique	and	Kelly,	who	were	both	sleeping	deeply	on</p>
<p class="calibre1">their	 beds.	 His	 eyes	 wandered	 across	 the	 other	 beds,	 seeing	 that	 Estelle	 and Chaz,	 too,	 lay	 in	 the	 same	 positions	 they	 had	 when	 they	 collapsed	 onto	 the mattresses.	It	looked	like	he	was	the	only	one	suffering	from	bad	dreams. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following	 their	 titanic	 and	 exhausting	 final	 battle,	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	 had	 landed back	 on	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>,	 where	 Parks	 had	 seen	 to	 it	 that	 they	 were	 given	 their	 own private	quarters,	so	they	could	rest	undisturbed.	No	more	cargo	holds	for	them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They	had	all	taken	a	short	nap	before	being	called	to	eat	a	meal,	before	heading</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	to	their	quarters	to	sleep	for	the	remainder	of	the	journey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For	 all	 they	 had	 witnessed	 that	 long	 day,	 no-one	 spoke	 one	 word	 of	 their</p>
<p class="calibre1">experience.	 They	 ate	 in	 silence,	 the	 failed	 retake	 of	  <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>,	 the	 fight	 aboard Arlos	 starport,	 and	 the	 treachery	 of	 Hawke	 remaining	 unbroached.	 Whether	 it</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	due	to	exhaustion,	Dodds	could	not	say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	exhaled	and	stared	up	at	the	ceiling.	Today	had	been	one	of	the	hardest</p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 most	 testing	 days	 of	 his	 life.	 But	 he	 had	 emerged	 from	 it	 unscathed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thoughts	 turned	 over	 in	 his	 head.	 Two	 months	 ago	 he	 had	 made	 himself	 a</p>
<p class="calibre1">promise:	 he	 would	 return	 to	 duty	 and	 put	 things	 right,	 no	 matter	 how	 long	 it took.	And	although	he	had	made	errors	along	the	way,	he	considered	that	today</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 had	 done	 a	 few	 things	 right.	 He	 had	 saved	 lives,	 lots	 of	 them;	 he	 had	 done everything	that	had	been	asked	and	required	of	him;	and	this	time	-	this	time	-	he</p>
<p class="calibre1">had	seen	to	it	that	when	taking	matters	into	his	own	hands,	the	ends	had	justified</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	means. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p318"></a>But	 the	 question	 remained:	 was	 he	 redeemed?	 Of	 all	 the	 questions	 in	 his head,	this	was	perhaps	the	one	that	was	easiest	to	answer:	No.	No,	he	was	not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poppy	Castro	and	Stefan	Pitt	were	still	dead,	and	no	matter	what	he	did	he	could</p>
<p class="calibre1">not	bring	them	back.	He	had	taken	their	lives	unlawfully	and	that	was	a	fact	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	would	have	to	live	with	for	the	rest	of	his	life.	Maybe	one	day	their	families</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	forgive	him,	and	then	at	last	he	would	be	able	to	forgive	himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	closed	his	eyes	again;	but	still	their	faces	remained. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The	three	carriers	exited	jump	space	and	arrived	back	in	the	Temper	system,	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">far	out	from	Spirit.	Estelle	and	Chaz	woke	first,	sitting	up	and	trying	to	shake	off</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	 sleepiness	 in	 their	 heads.	 Dodds	 clambered	 down	 from	 his	 bunk	 as	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">announcement	of	their	arrival	back	at	Spirit	repeated	itself	over	the	carrier's	PA. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He	 woke	 Enrique	 and	 Kelly,	 letting	 them	 know	 they	 were	 almost	 home	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">would	soon	be	able	to	disembark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	 as	 the	 five	 attempted	 to	 leave,	 they	 were	 once	 again	 asked	 to	 remain</p>
<p class="calibre1">where	 they	 were	 by	 a	 number	 of	 familiar-looking	 personnel,	 who	 stood	 guard</p>
<p class="calibre1">outside	 their	 quarters.	 After	 being	 stuffed	 into	 the	 cargo	 hold	 for	 several	 hours earlier,	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	 knew	 better	 than	 to	 object.	 Whilst	 they	 waited,	 they	 sat around	 in	 a	 group	 and	 made	 lazy	 conversation	 about	 anything	 but	 black-clad</p>
<p class="calibre1">soldiers,	traitors	and	refugees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sometime	later,	Omar	 Wyatt	arrived	to	 escort	them	away,	 leading	them	to</p>
<p class="calibre1">what	remained	of	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	flight	deck,	where	the	group	would	be	transferred	to Spirit	 Orbital.  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	 corridors	 were	 quite	 empty,	 the	 vast	 majority	 of	 the surviving	crew	having	already	disembarked.	The	deck	was	just	as	quiet,	only	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">handful	of	service	personnel	in	attendance.	The	five	boarded	the	transport	alone, </p>
<p class="calibre1">still	saying	very	little	to	one	another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	 wondered	 to	 himself	 what	 was	 next	 for	 him	 and	 his	 wingmates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After	proving	themselves	in	real	combat	situations	with	the	ATAFs,	would	they</p>
<p class="calibre1">now	 go	 on	 to	 take	 on	 the	 role	 that	 had	 previously	 been	 assigned	 to	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Red</i> <i class="calibre4">Devils</i>?	 Or	 would	 they	 just	 go	 back	 to	 performing	 their	 routine	 patrols	 around Temper	 and	 other	 Confederation	 border	 systems?	 As	 the	 transport	 docked	 with</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	station,	Dodds	decided	that	his	questions	were	best	left	to	be	answered	in	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">next	few	days.	He	had	far	too	much	to	think	about	as	it	was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 rear	 door	 of	 the	 shuttle	 opened	 and	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	 began	 to	 depart	 the craft,	 seeing	 the	 flight	 deck	 of	 Spirit	 Orbital	 swamped	 with	 men	 and	 women. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p319"></a>Several	dozen	heads	whipped	around	to	see	who	the	occupants	of	 <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>'s	final transport	were	and	at	once	a	cry	went	up.	“There	they	are!	It's	them!	Look!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stepping	out	of	the	transport,	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	were	met	by	an	enormous	crowd</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 people,	 all	 eager	 to	 meet	 the	 mysterious	 fighter	 pilots	 that	 had	 fought	 back against	almost	impossible	odds.	With	some	hesitance,	the	 <i class="calibre4">White	Knights</i>	walked</p>
<p class="calibre1">towards	 the	 throng	 as	 hands	 thrust	 forward	 to	 be	 shook,	 whilst	 others	 clapped them	on	the	back	in	thanks	and	congratulations. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Parks	watched	the	scene	unfold	from	an	observation	room,	reluctantly	aware	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">he	 would	 not	 be	 able	 to	 keep	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	 a	 secret	 forever.	 Whether	 he	 had brought	 them	 off	 first	 or	 last,	 it	 was	 doubtful	 that	 someone	 would	 not	 have recognised	 them.	 He	 watched	 as	 the	 coastguards	 –	 the	 orbital's	 security	 staff	 -</p>
<p class="calibre1">that	had	been	assigned	to	clear	the	flight	deck	and	sneak	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	away	were overwhelmed	by	the	crowd.	One	looked	up	towards	Parks,	a	defeated	expression</p>
<p class="calibre1">on	 her	 face.	 She	 shrugged.	 Parks	 made	 no	 gesture.	 At	 least	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	 were safe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turner	 stood	 behind	 Parks,	 at	 the	 back	 of	 the	 room,	 away	 from	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">windows,	 waiting	 for	 Parks	 to	 present	 him	 with	 the	 data	 card	 the	  <i class="calibre4">Knights</i>	 had retrieved	from	Barber.	Turner	had	waited	at	Spirit	for	his	return,	so	that	he	too</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	confirm	the	plans	were	safe	before	at	last	notifying	the	President	and	her</p>
<p class="calibre1">Office.	 Aside	 from	 the	 two	 senior	 officers,	 the	 only	 other	 occupants	 of	 the observation	room	were	a	team	of	six	other	coastguards,	five	of	whom	were	well</p>
<p class="calibre1">armed,	the	sixth	holding	a	large	metal	case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How	the	hell	did	we	miss	Hawke?”	Turner	asked,	sounding	angry	at	both</p>
<p class="calibre1">himself,	Parks,	and	the	CSN	in	general. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“None	 of	 the	 signs	 were	 present	 to	 begin	 with,	 sir,”	 Parks	 said,	 turning</p>
<p class="calibre1">away	 from	 the	 window,	 towards	 the	 admiral.	 “They	 only	 appear	 to	 have	 fully</p>
<p class="calibre1">manifested	themselves	within	the	past	few	hours.	It	may	well	have	been	a	result</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	being	in	a	combat	situation	with	the	Enemy,	although	it	could	have	been	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">kind	of	dormant	sleeper	system.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	that	is	so,	then	it's	very	worrying.	How	many	more	could	there	be	who</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	slipped	through	the	net?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All	the	standard	tests	came	back	negative.	There	was	nothing	in	his	blood, </p>
<p class="calibre1">and	 the	 retina	 and	 brain	 scans	 were	 as	 expected.	 There	 was	 nothing	 unusual</p>
<p class="calibre1">about	him;	he	was	perfectly	normal,”	Parks	said,	repeating	a	belief	the	two	men</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p320"></a>had	at	one	time	held. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turner	tutted	and	shook	his	head.	“When	we	pulled	him	out	of	that	escape</p>
<p class="calibre1">pod	my	gut	feeling	was	to	suspend	him	immediately,	or,	at	the	very	least,	hold</p>
<p class="calibre1">him	 back	 from	 direct	 involvement	 in	 critical	 operations.	 But	 as	 you	 know,	 we need	 every	 good	 man	 we	 can	 get	 our	 hands	 on	 and	 I	 couldn't	 risk	 removing</p>
<p class="calibre1">someone	 like	 that	 from	 service.”	 The	 admiral	 started	 to	 pace,	 looking	 down	 at the	 floor.	 “Aside	 from	 his	 refusal	 to	 co-operate	 during	 the	 operation,	 did	 he	 do anything	else	to	rouse	suspicions?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No,	 he	 even	 went	 as	 far	 as	 to	 destroy	 an	 Imperial	 frigate	 commanded	 by</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	Enemy,”	Parks	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did	you	get	a	good	look	at	that	frigate?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There	wasn't	much	time.	Hawke	destroyed	it	almost	as	soon	as	it	arrived.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then	 it	 was	 probably	 part	 of	 the	 ruse.	 I'd	 bet	 good	 money	 that	 it	 was</p>
<p class="calibre1">worthless	to	them	anyway.	Was	probably	completely	unmanned,	in	a	poor	state</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	repairs,	and	ready	to	fall	apart	any	day	now.	You're	going	to	have	to	sharpen</p>
<p class="calibre1">up	about	these	sorts	of	issues,	Elliott.”	Turner	continued	pacing	back	and	forth	in</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	small	area.	“Was	Hawke	acting	alone	on	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>?	Was	anyone	else	involved?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It's	 difficult	 to	 be	 certain.	 From	 what	 we've	 been	 told	 by	 the	 survivors, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawke	surrendered	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>	to	the	Enemy	and	allowed	them	to	come	aboard.	After</p>
<p class="calibre1">that,	 the	 Enemy	 started	 to	 systematically	 kill	 off	 the	 crew.	 We	 found	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">survivors	hiding	in	the	ventilation	units	near	the	power	cores.	They	weren't	even</p>
<p class="calibre1">aware	that	Hawke	had	survived.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turner	grunted	his	dismissal	of	the	survivors'	statements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	 went	 on.	 “The	 Enemy	 abandoned	 the	 carrier	 when	 Zackaria	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">Hawke	were	spaced.	They	picked	both	of	them	up	in	transports	and	fled	Phylent, </p>
<p class="calibre1">along	with	 <i class="calibre4">Dragon</i>	and	the	frigates	that	had	joined	it.	It	looks	like	he's	been	held in	high	regard	for	quite	sometime;	certainly	up	there	with	Rissard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	 didn't	 think	 to	 destroy	 the	 transport	 before	 Hawke	 and	 the	 admiral</p>
<p class="calibre1">could	escape?”	Turner	stopped	pacing	and	looked	up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I...	 hesitated,	 sir,”	 Parks	 apologised.	 He	 had	 indeed	 held	 back	 on</p>
<p class="calibre1">destroying	 the	 transport,	 since	 leaving	 both	 men	 to	 escape	 was,	 in	 his	 opinion, the	lesser	of	two	evils.	Allowing	Zackaria	to	live	would	permit	him	to	continue</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 the	 anticipated	 assault	 against	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 galaxy,	 whilst	 killing	 him would	extinguish	all	hope	of	halting	to	Enemy's	advance	for	good.	At	the	end	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	day,	it	came	down	to	numbers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turner	 nodded.	 “I'm	 sure	 it	 was	 not	 without	 good	 reason,	 Commodore.	 I</p>
<p class="calibre1">may	have	acted	in	exactly	the	same	way	had	I	been	in	your	place.	Whilst	there	is</p>
<p class="calibre1">no	 reason	 to	 believe	 that	 upon	 capturing	 Zackaria	 we	 could	 expect	 him	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">cooperate,	there	is	no	harm	in	trying.	It	would	have	made	everything	that	much</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p321"></a>easier	though.	For	now,	it	is	important	that	we	establish	whether	or	not	Hawke was	acting	of	his	own	free	will.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	will	have	a	full	background	check	made	against	him	immediately,	as	well</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	the	survivors	from	 <i class="calibre4">Ifrit</i>,”	Parks	said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 need	 every	 detail,	 Commodore.	 If	 there	 is	 even	 the	 slightest	 shred	 of</p>
<p class="calibre1">evidence	 to	 suggest	 that	 this	 thing	 no	 longer	 affects	 purebred	 Imperials,	 then everything	changes:	we'll	have	a	full-blown	galactic	pandemic	on	our	hands	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">we	need	to	be	sure	that	we	are	able	to	control	this	thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both	 Parks	 and	 Turner	 looked	 to	 the	 six	 other	 men	 occupying	 the	 room, </p>
<p class="calibre1">aware	 they	 should	 conduct	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 conversation	 in	 more	 private	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1">secure	surroundings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Someone	should	probably	tell	his	wife,	too,”	Turner	added. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	nodded	and	glanced	back	down	to	the	flight	deck,	where	the	 <i class="calibre4">Knights</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">were	 still	 receiving	 praise	 and	 admiration	 for	 their	 day's	 work,	 the	 five	 pilots having	twice	overcome	next	to	impossible	odds	in	the	space	of	just	a	few	hours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	never	doubted	their	potential,	Elliott,”	Turner	commented	behind	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Neither	did	I.”	Parks	turned	his	back	on	the	scene	below	him	and	walked</p>
<p class="calibre1">over	 to	 Turner,	 fishing	 the	 data	 card	 out	 of	 a	 pocket	 and	 presenting	 it.	 Turner picked	up	a	portable	device	that	lay	on	a	table	next	to	him	and	inserted	the	card</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	a	slot	in	the	base.	The	device	jingled	and	the	screen	informed	him	that	it	was</p>
<p class="calibre1">accessing	the	card,	then	set	about	decrypting	the	data.	Before	long,	it	displayed</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	card's	content. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several	dozen	text	options	ran	the	length	of	the	screen,	along	with	options</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	 manipulate	 the	 card	 and	 its	 data.	 The	 device	 itself	 was	 little	 more	 than	 a screen,	 the	 surface	 touch-sensitive.	 With	 his	 finger	 tip,	 Turner	 tapped	 the	 only piece	of	text	that	mattered	to	him, </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Operation	Sudarberg</i></p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">More	 words	 filled	 the	 screen.	 Amongst	 the	 text	 present	 were	 sections</p>
<p class="calibre1">entitled	 “ATAF”,	 with	 subsections	 detailing	 “Overview”,	 “Schemas”,	 “Phase</p>
<p class="calibre1">Analysis”	and	“Implementation”. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	stood	in	silence	by	Turner's	side,	watching	as	the	admiral	continued</p>
<p class="calibre1">to	tap	through	various	sections	and	subsections	of	the	data.	Images	of	the	ATAF, </p>
<p class="calibre1">concepts	 and	 blueprints	 flashed	 across	 the	 device's	 screen	 and	 Turner	 moved</p>
<p class="calibre1">quickly	 through	 them,	 not	 lingering	 long	 on	 the	 overview,	 schemas	 and	 phase</p>
<p class="calibre1">analysis	 sections.	 Neither	 of	 the	 two	 needed	 to	 see	 it	 all	 in	 detail.	 They	 knew</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p322"></a>what	they	was	looking	at,	having	seen	it	almost	every	day	for	the	past	four	years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally,	 Turner	 tapped	 through	 the	 “Implementation”	 section	 and	 watched</p>
<p class="calibre1">as	an	animation	played	on	the	screen.	It	showed	an	overview	of	Imperial	space. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five	 star	 systems,	 Mekel,	 Carthege,	 Haylahe,	 Atlante,	 and	 Codexa,	 were</p>
<p class="calibre1">highlighted.	 They	 were	 positioned	 close	 to	 one	 another	 and	 situated	 near	 the centre	 of	 Imperial-controlled	 space.	 As	 the	 animation	 played	 through,	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">galactic	map	zoomed	out	to	reveal	all	of	Imperial	space	and	a	small	number	of</p>
<p class="calibre1">Independent	 systems,	 running	 the	 border.	 Five	 pale	 yellow	 spheres	 expanded</p>
<p class="calibre1">from	each	of	the	five	highlighted	Imperial	systems,	engulfing	all	of	the	Imperial-</p>
<p class="calibre1">occupied	territory	and	the	handful	of	Independent	world	systems.	Statistics	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">other	various	items	of	information	began	to	fill	the	screen,	though	Turner	did	not</p>
<p class="calibre1">wait	to	see	it	all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Good	 work,	 Commodore,”	 he	 said,	 powering	 down	 the	 device.	 He</p>
<p class="calibre1">removed	the	card	and	placed	it	into	a	small	plastic	container.	He	then	beckoned</p>
<p class="calibre1">forward	 the	 coastguard	 holding	 the	 large	 metal	 case	 and	 placed	 the	 data	 card within	 it.	 The	 size	 of	 the	 case	 was	 absurd	 for	 the	 tiny	 object	 that	 it	 had	 been brought	to	carry,	but	the	data	was	deserving	of	the	protection;	for	the	time	being</p>
<p class="calibre1">at	least.	Both	Parks	and	Turner	knew	that	it	would	be	kept	safe	until	its	retrieval</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	confirmed	by	government	officials,	after	which	it	would	be	destroyed.	The</p>
<p class="calibre1">security	officer	stood	back	with	the	others	and	awaited	further	instructions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	 have	 also	 obtained	 full	 combat	 statistics	 for	 the	 ATAFs,”	 Parks	 said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They	 are	 currently	 being	 correlated	 on	  <i class="calibre4">Griffin</i>.	 I	 should	 be	 able	 to	 have	 them sent	to	you	within	a	few	hours.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everything?”	Turner	asked	in	surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If	that	is	the	case,	then	we	have	all	the	information	we	need,”	Turner	said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">walking	over	to	the	window	and	looking	down	at	the	celebrations	and	cheers	that</p>
<p class="calibre1">continued	 below	 him.	 He	 looked	 over	 at	 Parks	 who	 had	 joined	 him.	 “We	 now</p>
<p class="calibre1">have	only	one	hurdle	left	to	overcome.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parks	nodded	his	understanding	and	together	the	two	men	left	the	room. </p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">*	*	*</p>
<p class="calibre1"/>
<p class="calibre1">A	 man	 took	 back	 a	 bottle	 of	 tequila	 that	 he	 had	 previously	 thrust	 into	 Dodds' </p>
<p class="calibre1">hand.	He	whooped	and	waved	it	around	in	the	air	before	noticing	that	the	flight</p>
<p class="calibre1">deck	 had	 fallen	 quiet.	 Dodds	 and	 Enrique	 looked	 over	 at	 the	 parting	 crowds	 to see	 Parks	 and	 Turner	 walking	 towards	 them.	 Personnel	 stood	 to	 attention	 and</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p323"></a>saluted	the	two	men	that	walked	between	them,	the	admiral's	expression	one	of slight	irritation	at	the	rowdy	behaviour	of	the	spontaneous	celebration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“At	ease,”	Turner	muttered,	stopping	in	front	of	Estelle	and	her	team	mates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lieutenant	de	Winter,	you	and	your	team	have	had	quite	a	day	from	what	I've</p>
<p class="calibre1">been	told.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sir,	 yes,”	 Estelle	 answered,	 swallowing	 hard,	 her	 eyes	 straying	 over	 to</p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	and	Kelly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Answering	the	call	to	stand	in	defence	of	your	carrier,	your	squadron	and</p>
<p class="calibre1">allied	forces	against	overwhelming	and	uncertain	odds;	risking	your	lives	to	go</p>
<p class="calibre1">well	above	and	beyond	the	call	of	duty,	at	a	moment's	notice...”	Turner	reached</p>
<p class="calibre1">into	a	small	box	that	Parks	held,	removing	a	medal	from	within	it.	He	fastened	it</p>
<p class="calibre1">carefully	 to	 Estelle's	 flight	 suit.	 “...	 whilst	 all	 the	 time	 acting	 within	 the	 full interest	of	the	Confederation	Stellar	Navy	and	her	government.	Congratulations, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lieutenant	Commander.”	He	shook	Estelle	by	the	hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly	 gasped.	 Dodds'	 jaw	 dropped	 and,	 meeting	 Enrique's	 eyes,	 saw	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1">man	mouth	the	admiral's	last	two	words	to	him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It	 took	 Estelle	 a	 moment	 for	 the	 realisation	 of	 her	 promotion	 to	 sink	 in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Th...	thank	you,	sir.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The	paperwork	will	be	officially	dealt	with	at	Mandelah,”	Turner	said	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">a	wink	and	a	smile,	as	the	shocked	woman	shook	Parks'	hand.	The	admiral	stood</p>
<p class="calibre1">back	 and	 began	 clapping,	 starting	 an	 applause	 that	 ran	 the	 length	 of	 the	 deck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turner	then	shifted	his	attention	to	Dodds	and	Enrique,	presenting	each	of	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">with	 a	 medal	 of	 their	 own,	 before	 shaking	 their	 hands	 and	 applauding	 them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They,	too,	were	promoted	to	the	next	highest	rank,	moving	from	second	to	first</p>
<p class="calibre1">lieutenant,	 the	 rank	 Estelle	 had	 previous	 held.	 Kelly	 followed	 suit	 not	 long thereafter	and	then	the	two	men	came	to	Chaz. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Congratulations,	Mr	Koonan,”	 Turner	said	as	 he	affixed	the	 medal	to	the</p>
<p class="calibre1">big	man's	suit.	The	applause	and	cheers	grew	louder	now	that	the	final	member</p>
<p class="calibre1">of	 the	 team	 had	 been	 presented	 with	 their	 promotion.	 Chaz,	 however,	 was	 not smiling,	and	as	Parks	took	his	hand	to	shake	it	Chaz	leaned	forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I	 thought	 you	 said	 you	 had	 the	 situation	 under	 control,  <i class="calibre4">Commodore</i>,”	 he said	in	hushed	tones.	Parks	met	his	eyes	and	for	a	brief	period	there	existed	some</p>
<p class="calibre1">extreme	 tension	 between	 the	 two	 men,	 each	 of	 their	 grips	 tightening	 on	 one</p>
<p class="calibre1">another's	hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We	  <i class="calibre4">do</i>,  <i class="calibre4">Lieutenant</i>,”	 Parks	 answered	 him.	 The	 two	 men	 released	 their handshake	and,	putting	on	his	best	poker	face,	Parks	applauded	Chaz	along	with</p>
<p class="calibre1">everybody	else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turner	 and	 Parks	 stepped	 aside	 and	 people	 surged	 forward	 to	 hoist	 the</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">White	 Knights</i>	 up	 on	 to	 their	 shoulders.	 As	 he	 was	 picked	 up,	 Chaz	 glared	 at</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p324"></a>Parks	who	continued	to	applaud	undeterred,	the	entire	exchange	going	unnoticed by	everyone	except	for	Turner,	who	had	seen	it	all	before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The	 bottle	 of	 tequila	 was	 once	 again	 doing	 the	 rounds	 as	 the	 merry	 troop</p>
<p class="calibre1">began	to	make	their	way	from	the	flight	deck	and	towards	the	space	station's	bar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kelly	 passed	 the	 tequila	 on	 without	 drinking,	 something	 playing	 on	 her	 mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Though	she	was	smiling	and	feeling	rather	jubilant	in	light	of	her	promotion,	she</p>
<p class="calibre1">was	still	concerned	about	seeing	one	of	her	father's	company's	ships	docked	at	a</p>
<p class="calibre1">port	 in	 Imperial	 space.	 She	 would	 be	 speaking	 to	 him	 about	 it	 the	 first	 chance she	got. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But	for	Dodds,	Enrique,	and	Estelle	there	was	nothing	that	could	bring	them</p>
<p class="calibre1">down,	the	thought	of	a	celebratory	drink	very	welcoming	indeed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Lieutenant	Dodds,”	Turner	called,	his	voice	clear	and	recognisable	above</p>
<p class="calibre1">the	din	of	song,	applause	and	chanting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those	carrying	the	freshly-promoted	first	lieutenant	stopped	and	turned	him</p>
<p class="calibre1">around	to	face	the	admiral.	“Sir?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You	did	a	good	job	today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dodds	grinned	back	at	him.	“Thank	you,	sir.” </p>
